    "the stellar radius is an important spatial scale that is smaller than 0.1 milliarcseconds and it will not be imaged directly even by the next generation of telescopes .",
    "other methods like interferometry can yield useful constraints , but the indirect techniques of spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry have much to offer .",
    "in particular , spectropolarimetric measurements can put unique constraints on the geometry of the system as well as thermodynamic and radiative environments of circumstellar material .",
    "many models show spectropolarimetry is a useful probe of circumstellar environments at small spatial scales .",

    "these signatures have the potential to directly constrain the density and geometry of the circumstellar material and probe the near - star environment .",
    "there have been several studies of young stars to date using low or medium resolution spectropolarimetry .",
    "almost every study was focused on one class of objects and is typically based on only a few nights of observations .",
    "though spectropolarimetric signatures have been detected in every class of star a many - epoch , high - resolution survey of any class of star has yet to be done .",
    "high - resolution linear spectropolarimetry measures the change in linear polarization across a spectral line .",
    "typical spectropolarimetric signals are very small , often a few tenths of a percent change in polarization across a spectral line .",
    "measuring these signals requires very high signal to noise observations and careful control of systematics to measure signals at the 0.1% level . in order to address these issues",
    ", we built a dedicated spectropolarimeter for the hivis spectrograph on the 3.7 m aeos telescope and performed a telescope polarization calibration ( harrington et al .",
    "2006 , harrington & kuhn 2008 ) . in the process , we have upgraded much of the hardware , calibrations , and created a dedicated reduction package in idl .",
    "this thesis provides a very careful and thorough characterization and analysis as well as a very large collection of data taken under a wide range of conditions in order to address these instrument - related issues .",
    "in addition to this large set of observations , a detailed comparison between instruments was performed .",
    "this data set was combined with recent and archival observations using another instrument as well as with previously published spectropolarimetry on three other instruments .",
    "the resulting 5-spectropolarimeter comparisons show that the hivis spectropolarimeter , as well as the results of the survey , are verified by all spectropolarimeters .",
    "we collected a large number of stellar observations on over 100 nights from 2004 to 2008 , monitoring roughly 30 herbig ae / be stars and 30 be and emission - line stars .",
    "these star types are thought to have very different circumstellar environments with various combinations of winds , disks , accretion , and jets ( cf .",
    "porter & rivinius 2003 and waters 1998 ) . however , there is still much debate over these processes .",
    "scattering theory is the one common framework used to describe linear spectropolarimetric signatures .",

    "the differences between the star - types and geometries will be discussed in chapter 1 .",

    "the detailed polarization calibration of the instrument and telescope will be discussed in chapter 4 .",
    "chapter 5 is devoted to comparing results between instruments - measurements of several stars with many different instruments will be compared .",
    "chapter 6 presents the herbig ae / be observing campaign and the initial h@xmath0 line profiles , stellar variability , and some individual stellar properties . before showing the detailed spectropolarimetric results in chapter 8 , the current scattering paradigm will be outlined and some examples given in chapter 7 . since the herbig ae / be observations do not conform to the current scattering theories , and a clear distinction between the hae / be stars and other stellar types must be made .",
    "chapter 9 will present a survey of some bright be and other emission - line stars which do seem to fit scattering theory much better . in chapter 10 , a new theory based on optical pumping",
    "will be discussed .",
    "this theory has the potential to fit the observations significantly better than scattering theory and has a number of advantages .",
    "the entire thesis will be summarized in chapter 11 .",
    "herbig ae / be stars ( haebe s ) are intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars ( see waters 1998 for a review ) .",
    "they are young , typically @xmath310myr old , and of spectral type a or b with masses of 2 - 8 m@xmath4 and photospheric temperatures of 7000 - 20000k .",
    "they typically are surrounded by an envelope of material and a circumstellar disk , a result of the star formation process .",
    "the modern criteria for a star to be classified as a haebe is that the a or b type star must have emission lines in it s spectrum and must emit an excess of infrared light from circumstellar material .",
    "the infrared excess requirement distinguishes the haebe stars from other a and b type stars , such as the classical be stars , which are not young and have infrared excesses from free - free emission .",
    "many haebe stars show evidence for active and dynamic circumstellar environments .",
    "images taken in either the optical or near infra - red show large gaseous disks extending to nearly 1000au from the star .",
    "these disks have holes in the central region .",
    "mid- and far - ir images as well as sub - mm measurements show emission from circumstellar dust from very near the star ( ir ) out to 100 s of au ( sub - mm ) .",
    "gaseous jets have been seen extending from the inner 10au out to nearly 1000au in some systems .",
    "spectroscopic studies have suggested evidence for hot extended chromospheres , small amounts of @xmath5100,000k gas near the star ( cf .",
    "bouret et al .",
    "1997 ) , azimuthal structures such as wind - streamers and bullets , polar down - flows , accretion and cool opaque shells ( cf .",

    "in a typical description of an individual haebe star based on spectroscopy many , if not all of these phenomena will be evoked to explain the observations ( cf .",
    "beskrovnaya et al .",

    "a typical conclusion from a spectroscopic study of an individual stars will conclude that an extended chromosphere is present outside the photosphere .",
    "the presence of sporadic polar down - flows will be outlined based on red - shifted components of helium emission lines . a disk - wind or chromospheric - wind with complex and rapidly variable structure",
    "will be described based on blue - shifted components of hydrogen and sodium emission lines .",
    "highly ionized species , such as nitrogen v , will be used as evidence for small clouds of high - temperature ionized gas near the star . a basic model for the circumstellar environment",
    "will be put forward that contains many of these components as well as discussions of the evidence . with so many varied effects involved that make specific statements about temperature , density , and geometry , a new and unique constraint on the circumstellar material would be most useful .",
    "to further develop spectropolarimetry as a technique and to compare results between different stellar systems , different star types must be observed over many epochs .",
    "a be star is simply a b type star that shows emission lines , but they are not necessarily young pre - main - sequence stars ( see porter & rivinius 2003 for a review ) .",
    "classical be stars , as opposed to herbig be stars are main - sequence stars that rotate quickly and show emission lines from circumstellar material .",
    "this circumstellar material is not a result of a formation process , as with the young herbig be stars .",
    "the circumstellar material is a direct consequence of the stellar properties .",
    "the emission from the circumstellar material itself is transient .",
    "there are some models that show evidence for accretion and/or winds in these systems , but the geometry and density are thought to be quite different .",
    "for instance , the region where h@xmath0 emission forms is said to be a few stellar radii in haebe stars but up to 30 in be stars . comparing the spectroscopic modeling of ab aurigae in bouret & catala 1998 with",
    "the interferrometrically resolved h@xmath0 in @xmath6 tau from quirrenbach et al .",
    "1994 shows a striking contrast .",
    "given that polarization arises from asymmetries in any system , a formation region that is ten times larger in size will have an inherently different asymmetry .",
    "when talking about polarized radiation in most astronomical settings , the stokes vector ( * i * ) is usually the best description of the polarized light .",
    "the stokes vector is an array of 4 numbers , iquv , that gives the intensity of the the light in different polarization states .",
    "i is the total intensity .",
    "q is the difference in intensity between 0@xmath7 and 90@xmath7 polarization states .",
    "u is the difference between 45@xmath7 and 135@xmath7 polarization states .",
    "v is the difference between the left and right handed circular polarization states .",
    "@xmath8    these parameters can be normalized to give the relative fraction of light in each polarization state .",
    "i is always positive whereas quv can be positive or negative with values from 0 to @xmath9i .",
    "for example , if the stokes vector is [ 2,1,0,0 ] then the intensity is 2 , the amount of light polarized at 0@xmath7 ( + q ) is 1 and there is no net polarization at 45@xmath7 , 135@xmath7 , left circular or right circular .",
    "the fraction of light in the q state is then q = q / i=50% . in the stellar scattering context ,",
    "once you have the stokes vector of the scattered light and the stellar light , which is typically unpolarized , you can define the normalized stokes parameters as the ratio of the flux in a particular polarization state and the total flux :    @xmath10    @xmath11    the combined stellar and scattered flux , @xmath12 & @xmath13 , are the total flux received from the source while the flux in any specific stokes parameter , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , are the individual polarized fluxes .",
    "you can also define the degree of linear polarization , p , as :    @xmath16    you can also project the primary vibrational direction of this polarization into your instrument s coordinate system as :    @xmath17      spectropolarimetry is a technique that measures the intensity as well as the polarization of light as a function of wavelength .",
    "this can be done many ways .",
    "some instruments use broad - band filters and polarizers on an imaging instrument to measure the polarization in a few different colors ( bvr ) .",
    "others use low or high resolution spectrographs ( r@xmath18100 to 300000 ) with polarizing optics to spectroscopically measure the polarization of light .",
    "solar physicists have been using spectropolarimetric measurements of the sun for a century now and have observed a wealth of effects . typically , high resolution ( r@xmath5 100,000 ) polarized spectra are taken of various regions of the sun ( corona , sunspot umbra , photosphere , etc ) .",
    "this type of measurement is so common that the polarization spectrum is designated as the  second solar spectrum \" .",
    "recently , people have begun to observe and model high resolution polarized spectra in a night - time astronomical setting .",
    "the star is unresolved and the polarization signatures are an average of all the stellar components .",
    "when you can resolve polarization changes across a single spectral line , significant effects are seen .",
    "for example , symbiotic binaries show 10% polarization across raman - scattered lines ( cf . harries & howarth 1996 ) .    recent spectropolarimetric observations of herbig ae / be stars reveal numerous small linear polarization variations across h@xmath0 ( cf .",
    "vink et al .",
    "2002 , 2005b , mottram et al .",
    "2007 , harrington & kuhn 2007 ) .",
    "our recent observations were the first to systematically search for and find spectropolarimetric variability with wavelength and epoch near obscured h@xmath0 emission ( harrington & kuhn 2007 ) . for most of our targets and a few in the literature ,",
    "the polarization change is clearly @xmath19 coincident with the h@xmath0 emission peak .",
    "the polarization changes only in and around the absorptive part of the line profile , and the polarization near the emission peak is nearly identical to the continuum polarization .",
    "thomson scattering has been suggested to describe the earlier linear spectropolarimetric variations seen across emission lines in haebe stars .",
    "electron scattering produces differential linear polarization effects centered on the h@xmath0 line center ( cf .",
    "vink et al .",
    "2005a ) in this _ scattering _ paradigm .",
    "a depolarization effect , where the polarized stellar continuum is diluted by unpolarized h@xmath0 emission , is invoked with o , b , and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( cf .",
    "mclean 1979 , oudmaijer & drew 1999 , harries howarth & evans 2002 ) to account for these polarization variations .",
    "apparent _ polarization effect near the absorptive line profile is possible via this mechanism , but it must be accompanied by a corresponding signature ( undetected in our survey ) in the emissive component .",
    "thus , scattering models can describe some classes of stars , but not the data we will describe .",
    "we note that magnetic effects may also contribute a linear polarization signal via the hanle or zeeman effects .",
    "however , observations of circular polarization in herbig ae / be stars and many other star types have shown that the stellar magnetic fields are much too small to cause the observed amplitude of polarization seen in our survey ( cf .",

    "the advanced electro - optical system telescope ( aeos ) is a 3.67 m , altitude - azimuth telescope , located on haleakala mountain , maui , hawaii .",
    "the spectrograph uses the f/200 coud optical path , with seven reflections ( five at @xmath20 incidence ) before coming into the optics room .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : aeostel ] , taken from the zemax ( industry standard optical design software ) telescope design .",
    "the optics room , shown in figure [ fig : coude_layout ] , contains visible ( 0.5 - 1.0@xmath21 m ) and ir ( 1.0 - 2.5@xmath21 m ) cross - dispersed echelle spectrographs .",
    "the visible spectrograph has 2 gratings which cover 500 - 770 nm and 640 - 1000 nm at resolutions of 12800 to 48900 .",
    "the common fore optics includes three fold mirrors , collimator , k - cell ( image rotator ) , fold - mirror , tip - tilt correction mirror , and a reimaging spherical mirror .",
    "a movable pickoff mirror allows for switching between the visible and ir channels ( thornton 2002 , thornton et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the spectropolarimeter is designed for use with the visible arm of the aeos spectrograph .",
    "the visible arm is shown in figure [ fig : opben ] . from the pickoff mirror , shown in the bottom",
    "left corner of the figure , the beam passes through the slit in the slit - mirror , reflects off a fold mirror , the collimator , echelle , collimator , long mirror , collimator , fold mirror 2 , and finally the cross disperser before being imaged on the ccd by a 5 lens camera .",
    "there is a slit - viewer camera that is focused on the slit - mirror that allows real - time monitoring of the object .",
    "the spectropolarimeter was mounted just downstream of the slit , near the image plane .",
    "the plate scale is 0.16@xmath22 pixel@xmath23 .",
    "the cross disperser s red setting was used for all observations before aug 28th 2007 and the blue setting was used afterwards ( to observe other wavelengths for other projects ) .",
    "the spectropolarimetry module for the aeos spectrograph consists of a rotating achromatic half - wave plate and a calcite savart plate .",
    "the savart plate is two crossed and bonded calcite crystals which separate the incoming , uncollimated beam into two parallel , orthogonally polarized beams displaced laterally by 4.5 mm .",
    "the half - wave plate allows the rotation of the linear polarization of the incoming light to allow complete measurement of the linear polarization of the incident light .",
    "the beams are displaced in the spatial direction ( along the long axis of the slit ) .    in a savart plate , the two beams ( extraordinary and ordinary rays )",
    "are swapped between the two crossed crystals so both displaced rays have the same optical path length through the calcite .",
    "this design contrasts with other spectropolarimeters which use fresnel rhomb retarders and a wollaston prism to separate the polarization states ( donati et al .",
    "1999 , kawabata 99 goodrich 2003 , manset & donati 2003 ) .",
    "the small deviation in the image plane splits each spectral order detected on the ccd into two orthogonally polarized orders separated by a few pixels , from which orthogonally polarized spectra are extracted separately . for example , the red cross disperser setting originally shows 19 orders across the ccd , but after insertion of the savart plate , it shows 38 ( 2 polarizations for 19 orders ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : chip ] .",
    "these components were added to the zemax optical ray trace model of the spectrograph to assess the aberrations and determine the specifications of the optics in order to produce the proper polarized - order separation on the ccd ( @xmath1825 pixels ) .",
    "the aberrations induced by the waveplate and savart plate were predicted to be smaller than half a pixel leading to insignificant image degradation . a deviation of 4.5 mm at the slit was found to separate the polarized - orders by @xmath1824.5 pixels on the ccd .",
    "a 60 mm savart plate produces this separation ( 0.075@xmath2460 mm ) .",
    "a halbo optics inc . savart plate with a 15 mm aperture was purchased and tested as well as a bolder vision optik inc .",
    "achromatic half - wave plate and a motorized , closed - loop rotation stage . the half wave plate retardance was measured with a lab ocean optics spectrograph and two crossed polarizers . the retardance varied roughly quadratically with wavelength at the 5% level from 5000 to 8000 , the useful range of the polarizers ) and was 0.49 waves retardance at h@xmath0 .",
    "the transmission of the savart plate was above 95% for these wavelengths .",
    "after calibration and testing of the half - wave plate , savart plate , and rotation stages , the instrument was assembled on the spectrograph on a movable plate which allows for the spectropolarimeter to be inserted or removed from the beam in under a minute .",
    "a dekker was mounted upstream of the slit to reduce the slit length from 15@xmath22 to @xmath187@xmath22 to minimize stray light introduced from the displacement .",
    "this also assures polarized order separation on the ccd .",
    "flat fields taken after installation showed that the polarized orders were each @xmath1830 pixels across ( @xmath184@xmath22 ) with a separation of 7 pixels between each polarized beam .    to test the equipment on the telescope , a linearly polarizing filter was mounted just upstream of the the spectropolarimeter , in order to feed 100% linearly polarzed light to the spectropolarimeter .",
    "hivis detected 95 to 98% polarization over the useful range of the polarizer ( 5000-8000 , orders 0 - 12 ) .",
    "this shows that hivis can detect linearly polarized light with the spectropolarimeter very efficiently .",
    "there have been many hardware changes over the last few years .",
    "these were done to repair and improve the overall performance and reliability of hivis .",
    "the original ccd s failed and were replaced twice .",
    "the polarimeter has been remounted with better alignment and less vignetting .",
    "a new tip - tilt guiding corrector has been installed and calibrated .",
    "a hard - mounted , adjustable dekkar and polarization calibration mount was installed to allow for quick , easy , and repeatable calibration and adjustment .",
    "the failed ccd - id20 s were replaced with similar copies , but an unresolved hardware / rfi issue caused this repair to fail .",
    "the original science camera failed and has been replaced by a new commercial 1k@xmath25 pixis camera ( princeton instruments ) and is working wonderfully .",
    "the calibration stage had lenses mounted that increased the flat - field flux by a factor of 6 and the thar lamp flux by a factor of 150 .",
    "these improvements greatly increase the ease and accuracy of spectral calibration .",
    "the spectrograph was designed to use two 2k@xmath244k lincoln labs high resistivity ccd - id20 s mounted side by side with a 15 pixel gap to form a 4k@xmath244k array .",
    "this setup was in use until september of 2006 .",
    "the ccd was set to rebin 2x2 so that the two output images are each 1024@xmath242048 pixels .",
    "the original science camera ccd s were functional until october 2004 when one of the two intermittently failed . after removing and testing the camera",
    ", it was determined that the bond - wires had come loose .",
    "the one good ccd was replaced and the camera was remounted for a july 2005 run ( deep - impact spectropolarimetry run , harrington et al .",
    "shortly thereafter , the ccd performance became intermittent .",
    "the camera was then removed for repair . in the summer of 2006",
    ", it was decided that both chips were irrepairable .",
    "a single spare ccd - id20 was installed for the august 9 , 21 , 26 , and sept 12 - 14 , 2006 observing runs .",
    "this ccd was quite flat and free of cosmitic defects .",
    "the camera worked well for some observations , but an intense , non - repeatable noise - signature was present on some nights , even after many attempted hardware fixes throughout the night .",
    "the noise remained throughout the following months testing at the telescope , but was not present in any lab tests .",
    "it is not certain what exactly is causing this error , but the non - repeatable nature of the noise as well as the complete saturation of the affected pixels , makes data with this ccd unusable .",
    "rfi is suspected because of the pulsed ringing nature of the noise which follows the readout direction , and the presence of this noise at the summit only .",
    "on 9 - 18 2006 , this spare ccd - id20 , as well as the entire dewar and camera mount , was taken off and replaced with a smaller commercial pixis 1024br 1k@xmath25 array by princeton instruments on a custom - fabricated mount .",
    "this camera , with slightly smaller pixels , performed quite well .",
    "the peak qe is 95% with @xmath570% qe past 900 nm and 85% qe at h@xmath0 , making the performance of this camera almost identical to that of the hivis science camera , although with the loss of complete focal plane coverage .",
    "the original ccd - id20 chips had a plate scale of 0.16@xmath22 per pixel and a dispersion of 0.07 per pixel .",
    "the original ccd s were rebinned 2@xmath242 onboard and the read time was about 1 minute .",
    "the pixis camera had slightly smaller pixels ( 13@xmath26 ) and thus a slightly greater plate scale and dispersion .",
    "the pixis camera is run in a unique way - with winview software on a standard windows - xp laptop .",
    "the camera has gui - set read - rate and gain parameters with a read rate options of 100 khz ( 11se ) or 2 mhz ( 0.5sec ) and gains of 1 , 2 , or 3 . since the stellar - spectropolarimetry program required near - saturation photon counts , the pixis camera , while slightly oversampling , was perfectly acceptable , especially with the hour - per - night of integration gained with the fast read time ( 0.5 s vs. 60 s ) .      on 11 - 17 - 2006 , some lenses and a mirror were installed on the calibration stage to increase the flux of calibration light in the spectrograph .",
    "the lens used with the flat field lamp focused the light onto the diffusion screen much more efficiently than the originally naked bulb , and caused a 6@xmath24 increase in the flat - field flux .",
    "the same lens setup when used with the thar lamp caused a similar increase in flux , but the improved thar exposure was still faint .",
    "originally , only 3 lines in the h@xmath0 order were seen at 100 adu above background in a 20 minute exposure with the widest ( 1.5@xmath22 ) slit !",
    "even a factor of 6 increase was nt enough .",
    "another mirror was installed on top of the diffusion screen to bypass the diffusion .",
    "this increased the flux to a total of @xmath18150@xmath24 the previous levels though introducing spatial structure to the thar exposures .",
    "this improvement allowed for accurate line identification because many lines could be detected with the smallest slit at the highest resolution , allowing for a better comparison with the line lists and much more accurate wavelength solutions .      on 11 - 17 - 2006 ,",
    "a new dekkar was fabricated and mounted on the common - optics bench .",
    "this was initiated because of the need to be able to move the dekker in and out of the beam quickly , easily , and repeatably by a single person .",
    "the dekker is required to reduce the length of the slit from the original 15@xmath22 to @xmath38@xmath22 to ensure complete polarized - order separation at the focal plane .",
    "this dekkar has much more accurate mounting and an adjustable width , allowing for more precise alignment and control of the slit length , leading to proper order separation at the focal plane .",
    "the dekkar is not a true knife - edge and is mounted roughly 2 cm away from the slit - mirror ( and hence image plane ) which leads to a @xmath188 pixel wide edge to each order .",
    "this is completely acceptable for the purpose of the survey .",
    "a removable polarization calibrator unit was installed on the new dekkar mount .",
    "a polarizing calibration optic ( linear - polarizer , quarter - wave - plate , etc ) can be mounted just up - stream of the polarimeter to allow the input of a known polarization state to the spectropolarimeter for calibration .",
    "this type of mount allows for night - to - night calibrations as well as efficient trouble - shooting to be done easily and repeatably .    on 10 - 26 - 2006 , the polarizing optics ( savart plate and wave - plate ) were remounted closer to the slit with more robust and precise hardware .",
    "the original polarimeter was mounted fixed on posts and had to be manually aligned .",
    "the mount also required 3 cm of optical path between the image plane ( slit ) and the entrance of the savart plate . since the clear - aperture of the savart plate was only 1 cm and the beam diverges from the slit , the larger the distance from the image plane , the more difficult the alignment , and the greater the possibility of vignetting .",
    "the savart plate was remounted on a closer - fitting , remote - controllable xy - stage that put the savart plate 2 cm closer to the image plane , reducing the vignetting .",
    "both the savart and the waveplate were then mounted on tip - tilt controllable rotation stages , allowing for a more precise alignment between the waveplate , savart plate , and optical axis .    on 11 - 28 - 2006 ,",
    "a replacement tip - tilt corrector was installed .",
    "the sbig stv unit takes an image of the slit - mirror , calculates the centroid position of the star on the slit , and sends a correction signal to a tip tilt mirror mounted on a piezo .",
    "the tip - tilt piezo voltages and alignment mirrors were recentered and the unit was recalibrated over the following month .",
    "the tip - tilt can not centroid on a target star ( v@xmath186 - 8 ) faster than once per second or so , and thus can only correct slow guiding errors . since aeos is specially designed for air - force use , it does not have a normal sidereal - guiding tracker scope and thus is subject to slow pointing drift .",
    "depending on how recently a pointing model has been performed , the drift can be significant .",
    "this is completely unacceptable and the tip - tilt corrector is essential to keep the star centered on the slit .",
    "the polarimeter has been remounted with better alignment and less vignetting .",

    "a new commercial 1k@xmath25 camera was mounted in place of the old science camera and is working wonderfully .",
    "the calibration stage had lenses mounted that increased the flat - field flux by a factor of 6 and the thar lamp flux by a factor of 150 .",
    "these improvements greatly increase the ease and accuracy of spectral calibration .",
    "the stokes parameters i , q and u fully specify the linear polarization state of light .",
    "q is the difference between horizontal and vertical polarizations .",
    "u is the difference between + 45@xmath7 and -45@xmath7 polarizations .",
    "typically , the fractional stokes parameters , q = q / i and u = u / i , defined in chapter 1 , are presented to quantify the fraction of the light which is polarized .",
    "these are measured by taking the fractional difference between the orthogonally polarized spectra .",
    "the observing sequence with the aeos spectrograph is to take spectra at 0 , 22.5 , 45 , and 67.5 degrees rotation of the half - wave plate with respect to the axis of the savart plate , hereafter called orientation 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "incoming light linearly polarized at some angle to the fast axis of the half wave plate will have its linear polarization states rotated by twice that angle . for example , incoming light polarized at 22.5@xmath7 with respect to the wave plate axis will exit polarized at 45@xmath7 ( stokes u @xmath27 q ) . since the axis of the savart plate remains fixed , the rotation of the wave plate by 45@xmath7 will move linearly polarized light from one polarized beam to the other , swapping their location on the ccd and reversing their sign in the fractional polarization calculation ( q @xmath27 -q ) .",
    "this allows for cancellation of systematic errors ( derivative , misalignment , ccd response , etc . ) in the stokes q and u calculations .",

    "the slit is parallel to the floor .",
    "+ u is parallel to the slit , and + q is rotated @xmath28 counter clockwise , pointing to the upper right . since the image rotator was not used , the projection of the slit on the sky is a function of pointing and is not constant .",
    "the simultaneous imaging of orthogonal polarization states also allows for a greater efficiency observing sequence and for reduction of atmospheric and systematic effects .",
    "since both polarized spectra are imaged simultaneously with identical seeing , a single polarization measurement ( q or u ) can be done with a single image , and consistency between images is easy to quantify .",
    "the polarization angle is measured in the telescope frame and a projection of the slit s position angle onto the sky is done with the k - cell .",
    "the aeos image rotator was not used so that the absolute angle of the slit on the sky was not fixed .",
    "however , the orientation of the k - cell mirrors in the optics room was fixed , making the polarization calibration much easier .",
    "the spectropolarimetric reduction pipeline can be broken into a few basic parts : 1 ) combining flats , darks , biases , 2 ) setting up the coordinate grids as x - pixel , y - pixel , slit - tilt and wavelength calibration , 3 ) calculating a first - pass spectrum by simply averaging all pixels at a given wavelength , 4 ) calculating more spectra based on optimal - extraction routines , with cosmic ray rejection and flux - weighting , 5 ) doing the polarization calculations , and 6 ) simulating and quantifying the systematic errors .      the first step is to produce an individual flat field , calculated as an average of many individual flats .",
    "typically , an average of 15 - 40 individual exposures is used with a 3-@xmath29 outlier rejection , a so - called clipped - mean , to produce an extremely accurate calibration . since this program depends on very high s / n measurements ,",
    "a minimum of 20 flat field images of 10000 adu each is required to get good s / n .",
    "the dark and bias calibration is done in a less - than - traditional way because of a slowly - fluctuating , non - repeatable background level .",
    "this effect is actually quite common with most detectors .",
    "there was an overscan region in the original science detector with the ccd - id20 s which allowed measurement of the changing dark levels throughout the night .",
    "the replacement pixis 1024br array is significantly smaller than the focal plane and is always exposed to light .",
    "both the original lincoln labs ccd - id20 s and the pixis detector showed a significant ( @xmath5few% ) drift in the bias levels throughout a night .",
    "the pixis camera had no overscan region , but the median values of all the darks taken over many months did show variation in the overall background levels .    these variations with this instrumental setup and background levels required a background subtraction from each frame using the unexposed pixels outside the echelle orders as this directly tracked the background levels of the chip and reduced the systematic uncertainties . for the short exposures of this program , the dark current was small , and is automatically corrected with the frame - by - frame background subtraction .",
    "since the instrumental setup and the order locations on the ccd s has changed much over the last few years , and changed quite often during the instrument work done in the fall of 2006 , setting up the coordinate grid requires more user - input than most dedicated reduction scripts .",
    "the user must supply a guess at the polarized order locations , typically 5 points to fit a 3rd - order polynomial , and a bright stellar image taken that night to serve as a template for the curvature of the orders .",
    "figure [ fig : coord ] shows a bright standard with the narrow h@xmath0 line near the center of the 1k@xmath25 array .",
    "the code sets up an initial polynomial fit to these user - input points , and then takes spatial ( vertical ) cuts at each spectral ( horizontal ) pixel .",
    "each of these spatial cuts are then fit by a gaussian to determine a robust location of the peak intensity in the spatial direction across the ccd , reducing the influence of cosmic rays or chip defects .",
    "these peak intensity positions allow for a robust fit to the order shape on the ccd with a slope of around 5% ( crossing a spatial pixel every 18 or 20 spectral pixels ) .",
    "the orders are fit independently and the shapes are the same to the 0.1 pixel level ( @xmath180.2% of an order width ) .",
    "the order separation , caused by the savart plate , is then calculated as the median difference between the two polynomial fits . for the pixis camera ,",
    "this was 58 - 59 pixels .",
    "the residuals between the calculated peak intensity and the polynomial fits are typically under half a pixel and show the expected oscillation with wavelength as spatial pixels are crossed .",
    "the star observed for the template is never completely centered in the slit from small guiding errors .",
    "once these order shapes are calculated from the stellar observations , the polynomials are adjusted to reflect the true slit center .",
    "this is done using the flat - field .",
    "first an average spatial profile ( slit illumination pattern ) is calculated for the flat field , centered on the stellar template by simply averaging the flat field along the order template in the spectral direction .",
    "these spatial profiles , shown in figure [ fig : flatslice ] clearly show the slit boundaries , where the flat field intensity falls off sharply .",
    "the flat - field spatial cuts are cross - correlated to find the offsets from the stellar order - shape polynomial fits to the center of the flat - field spatial cuts .",
    "once the offset from the stellar template to the flat - field region is calculated , the full coordinate grid can be computed with the order centers , edges , and background locations specified . once the coordinate grid is set ,",
    "a calibrated flat field can be created , adjusting for the blaze function , and wavelength dependence of the flat - field lamp ( blackbody ) .",
    "a flat - field is supposed to correct for pixel - to - pixel gain and field - dependent efficiencies only .",
    "the flat - field values should not introduce any blaze , lamp or spatial illumination dependencies .",
    "this means that the flat - field must be corrected for it s inherent spatial and spectral structure . to correct the flat field spectral",
    "dependence ( horizontal ) , a simple flat - field spectrum is made for each polarized order by averaging all pixels spatially at a given spectral position .",
    "this spectrum has a bit of intrinsic noise in it so a low - order polynomial fit is made .",
    "the flat - field image then has this spectral dependence removed .",
    "the spatial structure is corrected by dividing each spatial cut along the flat - field spectrum by the average spatial profile , removing the spatial dependence of the flat ( inhomogeneous slit illumination ) at each wavelength .",
    "this makes the flat - field much closer to a true pixel - to - pixel gain measurement , shown in figure [ fig : calibratedflat ] .      with the recent calibration - stage improvements that have implemented , it became possible to do very accurate wavelength calibration using low order polynomial fits to at least six clear , unblended lines , just over the h@xmath0 spectral region . with a @xmath5600x increase in thar flux ( 15x without the diffuser - bypass mirror ) , the smallest slit ( 0.35@xmath22 ) at highest resolution ( r=49000 )",
    "can be used to clearly identify lines and compare the lines with standard line - lists obtained from the noao spectral atlas .",
    "the new hivis detector has a wavelength scale of 0.037 per pixel ( 1.7 km / sec per pixel at h@xmath0 ) .",
    "thus the rotation of the earth can produce up to a @xmath30 pixel shift and seasonal variations can approach 40 pixels .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done in a two - step process . a th - ar spectrum taken with the 0.35 \"",
    "slit is used to identify the lines .",
    "the th - ar spectra are calculated with the simple average over all illuminated pixels .",
    "the unblended lines are identified and the peaks are fit by a gaussian to determine the line centers .",
    "a 3@xmath31 order polyomial fit to the line centers is used to create a wavelength array .",
    "the noao atlas spectrum , hivis spectrum , and a comparison ab - auriga spectrum are shown in figure [ fig : thar - fit ] .",
    "the triangles mark the 6 lines used in the polynomial fits .",
    "since all stellar observations were done with the 1.5@xmath22 slit , a 4-orientation sequence of thar spectra are taken with this slit and then reduced with the simple - average method .",
    "the resulting lower - resolution spectrum is cross - correlated with the higher - resolution spectra produced by the 0.35@xmath22 slit to determine any shifts between slits and waveplate orientations , the beam wander or wobble , which is a small fraction of a pixel .",
    "the average slit tilt is then calculated to modify the coordinate - grid for the reduction program .",
    "the tilt is a spectral - direction shift of @xmath187 pixels between the bottom and top of each order ( across the 50 pixel slit width ) .",
    "this shift is calculated as a cross - correlation of a spectral cut beween each spatial position along the order .",
    "this tilt is then implemented as a integer - pixel shift of the coordinate grid at each spatial point .",
    "there is a very significant increase in resolution when the tilted - coordinates are used .",
    "figure [ fig : thar - align ] shows the spectral cuts before and after alignment , as well as the intensity of the line calculated with both tilted and un - tilted coordinate grids .",
    "the spectral resolution derived from the th - ar line fits goes from r=30000 to r=49000 when using tilted coordinates .",
    "once the tilted coordinate grid , gain - table , and wavelength calibration is done , the data can be processed .",
    "each exposure is divided by the gain - table ( calibrated flat ) .",
    "a background spectrum is made by averaging the unexposed background region outside the polarized orders .",
    "this background is noisy and so a linear fit to this background is subtracted from each order to remove the dark current and bias of the detector .    to create a simple",
    ", first - pass at the spectrum , every pixel at each wavelength was simply averaged to compute the intensity .",
    "at the same time , an average spatial profile ( psf ) is constructed by averaging all these spatial cuts spectrally . while this method does not correct for cosmic rays , and does not weight the pixels by their fractional - stellar - flux or psf , this simple average spectrum provides a starting point for more sophisticated reductions .",
    "in many parts of the reduction package , one curve must be shifted and scaled to another .",
    "a least - squares routine that allows the calculation of the shift and scaling coefficients between two input curves was developed as part of the dedicated software package .",
    "the routine assumes that the scale and shift from one curve to another can be written in terms of the input curve and it s derivative .",
    "to illustrate the routine a shift - n - scale between the two polarized spectra , @xmath32 shifted and scaled to @xmath33 , is calculated below :",
    "@xmath34    i is the intensity as a function of ccd pixel x , a is the relative gain between the two orthoganally polarized spectra , usually @xmath181 , and b is the spectral shift in pixels , usually @xmath350.8 pixels .",
    "the spectrum @xmath36 can be expanded to first order as below :",
    "@xmath37    rewriting the constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 and bringing all terms to one side gives the difference between the spectra @xmath33 and @xmath32 scaled and shifted by a and b. the least squares routine minimizes the function below for all pixels ( x ) :    @xmath40    expanding the square and collecting terms while implicitly assuming that each term is a sum over all pixels gives :    @xmath41    to solve for k@xmath42 and k@xmath43 two equations must simultaneously solved . setting the derivative of this equation with respect to k@xmath42 and with respect to k@xmath43 equal to zero gives two equations that can be solved for the coefficients :    @xmath44    @xmath45    which gives the coupled equations that can be solved for the coefficients :    @xmath46 =                 \\left [ \\begin{array } { ll }   i^2_1 &   i_1 \\frac{di_1}{dx } \\\\",

    "an example of this routine applied to a spectrum of ab aurigae is shown in figure [ fig : shfscl ] .",
    "a single spectrum was replicated and shifted by one pixel and corrected by the shift - n - scale routine .",
    "the routine uses a smoothed profile to calculate the derivative with a variable amount of smoothing .",
    "for all the data presented here , a smoothing of 3 pixels was used .",
    "this illustrates how a misalignment of the savart plate , simulated as a spectral shift of 1 pixel between the orthogonally polarized spectra , produces a fractional difference of order 5% from this misalignment .",
    "this signature is a systematic error that follows the derivative of the spectral line .",
    "the scale and shift operation minimizes this derivative signal as shown ( amplified ) in the bottom line in the plot .",
    "the residual noise is at the level of 0.2% and has some residual systematic error in it from the smoothing used to calculate the derivative , but the derivative - based error has been attenuated by a factor of about 20 .",
    "the shift - n - scale routine also has some nonlinearity to it , and is best used for sub - pixel shifts when cross - correlation techniques fail .",
    "for example , when shift - n - scaling the original ab aurigae spectrum to the simulated one in figure [ fig : shfscl ] , the routine reproduced the shifts to better than 0.05% for spectral shifts of 5 pixels , far greater than the range needed . however , when shift - n - scaling the simulated curves to the original curve , the calculated shifts had an error of @xmath50.1 pixels for spectral shifts @xmath50.8 pixels .",
    "this shows that for even strongly varying line - profiles , the shifts are reproduced very well and , when used with cross - correlation techniques for single - pixel alignment , can produce very accurate sub - pixel alignments .",
    "this first - pass spectrum and average spatial profile are projected back on the original spatial cuts with the shift - n - scale routine .",
    "the expected noise at each spatial pixel is found ( using estimates of the gain and read - noise ) .",
    "the standard deviation of each spatial pixel at each wavelength is then calculated and used to find any cosmic - ray hits as cosmic - rays ( and chip defects ) which will be strong devations ( @xmath49 ) from the spatial profile .",
    "an example of this cosmic ray removal routine is shown in figure [ fig : cosray ] .",
    "the average spatial profile is the dashed line .",
    "the spatial cut at this wavelength shows a few pixels deviating strongly from the average spatial profile from a cosmic ray hit .",
    "these pixels are identified and replaced with the shifted - and - scaled spatial profile , greatly reducing the error in the spectrum .",
    "once this cosmic ray removal routine is done , a spectrum is calculated as the simple average of all the pixels .",
    "the corrected spatial cuts are passed on to more optimal spectral extraction routines .",
    "the first of the optimal extraction routines uses the shift - and - scale routine to fit the average spatial profile ( psf ) to each of the individual spatial cuts at each wavelength .",
    "this reduction process assumes that the spatial profile does not vary across the order , an assumption that all optimal reduction packages adopt ( horne 1986 , marsh 1989 , donati et al .",
    "1997 , cushing et al .",
    "the calculated error in the shifts between the optional fit and the calculated order location is dependent on the flux , but is typically less than 0.1 pixels .",
    "another set of spectra are calculated as simple gaussian fits to the spatial cuts . while the psf ( spatial cut ) is not entirely gaussian , and certain seeing conditions or tracking - errors lead to not - quite - gaussian spatial cuts ( psf s ) , the fits are usually robust , and match the shift - n - scale and simple - average specta well .",
    "the standard idl gaussfit routine is applied to each spatial cut , with the initial estimates for the gaussian as : peak intensity is twice the computed average - spectra , centered on the order , with a fwhm of one - quarter the order width and zero background .",
    "the routine works well when the spatial cuts ( psf s ) are roughly gaussian .",
    "thus , there are three spectra with different systematic effects ( simple - average , shift - n - scale , gaussian - fit ) - which are all included in the polarization analysis to probe the polarimetric reduction codes and systematic errors inherent in these reductions . in practice ,",
    "the exact choice of reduction parameters is unimportant .",
    "figure [ fig : difred ] shows the simple - average method with and without a flat field or tilted coordinates , and varying order widths from 43 to 49 pixels ( covering the edges of the illuminated region , see figure [ fig : flatslice ] ) .",
    "the tilted coordinates do add a significant increase in resolution , but for the high signal - to - noise spectropolarimetric observations the spectra are rebinned to lower resolution anyways .",
    "the flat field does increase the signal - to - noise of the intensity calculation , but as shown below , the basic polarization calculations are independent of the flat field .",
    "the aeos telescope is designed for military applications and does not have a standard siderial guiding telescope .",
    "there are significant tracking errors that can accumulate and there are offsets induced by manual telescope - operator corrections .",
    "the operation requirements set out by the afrl require that there is no control over the guiding by any outside equipemnt , and that the telescope operators completely control the pointing of the telescope .",
    "there are a number of data set s where an operator s manual steps caused a non - gaussian spatial profile .",
    "this inhomogeneity requires the reduction program to calculate the spectra using all three methods .",
    "the simple averaging and shift - n - scaling methods are the most robust .",
    "these three different reductions vary slightly between each other .",
    "the gaussian - fit and simple - average methods vary by only a few parts - per - million when the spatial cuts ( psf s ) are gaussian . however , the shift - n - scale method and the simple - average methods vary slightly across the line profile , giving an overall uncertainty in the shape of the intensity profile . however , the spectropolarimetry is calculated as the difference between line profiles on the same image .",
    "since the same reduction method is applied to each polarized order in the same way for each polarization measurement , it is only any differential error that would cause systematic errors in the spectropolarimetry .",
    "the reduction package uses all three calculation methods to assess the systematic errors that might be present in each method , or in the subsequent processing of the spectra .",
    "the focus in this work is on spectral and spectropolarimetric variability . with the many spurious polarization effects such as instrumental , telescope , interstellar , and intrinsic continuum polarizations ,",
    "a continuum - polarization subtraction must be done to isolate the change across any individual spectral line . since spectral variability",
    "is always referenced to continuum , no spectrophotometric or flux calibration is done , though standards are observed for future work .",
    "the continuum is simply subtracted as a linear fit to the intensity on either side of the spectral line .",
    "this continuum subtraction normalizes the slope of the black - body of the star , removes the instrumental continuum polarization signals , and removes the instrumental blaze efficiency .",
    "continuum subtraction is done by averaging 20 pixels sufficiently far enough away from chip edges .",
    "there is a variable dark signal that curves the echelle orders near the edge of the chip , 10 - 20 pixels wide , in a non - repeatable way , so this region is avoided .",
    "cirrus , tracking errors , and wind - bounce all influence the throughput of the spectrograph and thus , even on a spectrophotometric night , a significant variation in the continuum flux is sometimes seen .    the data taken before 10 - 27 - 2006 was imaged using an echelle order which placed the h@xmath0 line near the edge of the chip .",
    "this placement was done before some of the instrumental corrections , and before the remounting of the pixis camera to a different region of the focal plane . in the more recent data , h@xmath0 is closer to the blaze - efficiency peak and is much closer to the center of the focal plane .",
    "the continuum fits to the ccd - id20 images were not as accurate because the red wings of the h@xmath0 line were near the order edge , giving rise to a small ( @xmath181% ) error in slope estimate .",
    "however , this uncertainty is negligable for data taken on each night because the continuum is calculated in the same way for each instrumental setup on each night .",
    "this only produces an uncertainty in the night - to - night variability of the line profiles , and in the overall slope of the calculated continuum and continuum polarization .",
    "h ]    at this point it is useful to demonstrate the coordinate grid and basic properties of the reduction package by demonstrating the wavelength dependence of the point - spread function properties .",
    "several authors have argued that the change in centroid location ( brightness peak ) or full - width at half - max ( fwhm ) can be used as evidence for binarity in a set of spectroastrometric calculations ( beckers 1982 , bailey 1998 , baines et al .",
    "spectroastrometry in principle is a technique that can detect unresolved binaries as a change in spatial profile width ( psf ) and location ( centroid ) across an emission or absorption line where the relative brightness of the two binary components significantly varies across the line .",
    "for example , if one star has an emission line and the other an absorption line , the centroid will shift towards the emitter in the core of the emission line .",
    "if the binary is significantly wide and bright , the fwhm would also decrease across the line as the relative contribution to the psf from the wide companion is reduced .",
    "this method makes use of the assumption that the psf across a line or spectral order does not change much , and that any significant change can be attributed to the source .",
    "some have even developed routines to separate the fluxes from the individual binary components ( porter et al .",
    "hivis has been used to observe a number of young or emission - line stars as part of a large survey ( harrington & kuhn 2007 ) all of which have strong h@xmath0 lines .",

    "this allows one to establish the position - angle of the binary system . for polarimetric reasons expanded below",
    ", the image rotator is not used to keep this component fixed vertically during the observations .",
    "this means that the position - angle rotates from exposure to exposure , but presenting the calculations is still useful to demonstrate the capability of the analysis software .    for each spectrum ,",
    "the optimal spectral extraction algorithms fit gaussians and average spatial profiles ( psf s ) to the data at each wavelength , as was shown in figure [ fig : cosray ] .",
    "these spatial profiles can easily be compared with the nominal values for the average spatial profile s fwhm and centroid for each order . at each wavelength , a deviation for the fwhm and the centroid can be calculated .",
    "because of small guiding errors , the centroid of each stellar observation does not coincide with the exact order center .",
    "because of the tilt of the orders on the detector , this will cause the centroid of the spectrum to cross spatial pixels at different spectral pixel locations . in order to correct for this ,",

    "the centroid then gradually rises over the emission to a peak of 5 - 15mas just before the emission line returns to continuum on the red side of the line .",

    "there are actually six curves in the top panel of figure [ fig : specast - pcyg ] but the difference between order widths of 41 and 47 is completely negligible .",

    "when the wings of the psf are neglected by using a width of 41 , the calculated fwhm deviations are significantly smaller , near 75mas , presumably because the wings of the psf have a noise contribution .",

    "the saturated exposure shows an extra 50mas increase in fwhm across the emission peak in the clipped region of the line for all reductions .    [ !",
    "h ]    another complication is extended emission .",
    "a change in fwhm and centroid can be caused by significant resolved emission around an object , such as the observations of t ori .",
    "if there is no inspection of the raw data , this emission may be falsely reported as a binary detection .",
    "also - one can not rule out the possibility of unresolved nebulosity as a significant contribution to the psf .",

    "the wavelength dependence of the psf for two reductions , using tilted and untilted coordinates , is shown in figure [ fig : specast - tori ] .",
    "the centroid shift is small , roughly 40mas and is independent of the order tilt .",
    "the fwhm changes by roughly @xmath980mas when using untilted coordinates , but is essentially zero when using tilted coordinates .",
    "this can arise when a vertical order geometry intersects the fully - resolved emission near the edges of the order .",
    "when using properly tilted coordinates , the fully resolved emission becomes an added background that does not influence the gaussian fitting .",

    "since no method was significantly different than any other , the easiest to implement was selected - a simple average applied to each individual exposure set .",

    "since this is a fractional quantity , any correction applied equally to each order and to each chip , such as spectrophotometric calibrations , vignetting corrections or skyline subtractions , will not change the polarimetry in any significant way .",

    "a cross - correlation is done on the spectra to ensure that the spectra aligned to a single pixel , as a double - check on the wavelength calibration .",
    "since any interpolation can effect and corrupt the noise statistics of the spectra , as shown by the shift - n - scale example in figure [ fig : shfscl ] , subpixel alignment must minimize the derivative signal more than it introduces extra noise . to evaluate all three alignments ,",

    "the systematic error with this high rotation rate causes complete loss of information about u while doubling the time spent measuring q. it also causes the benefits of beam - swaping to be lost entirely and it causes the reduction methods to fail .",
    "since the expected spectropolarimetric signals are subtle differences in the polarized line profile shapes of less than one percent , and the few reported detections show polarization of at most 1% , the lines must be calculated with at least s / n@xmath57 300 in all spectral - resolution - elements .",

    "the code also shows that it takes a wobble of at least 2 full pixels between each orientation , for a total of a 6-pixels misalignment to produce a 1% systematic error in a stokes parameter for strong lines . using the shift - n - scale routine , as well as the thar measurements ,",
    "this wobble was measured to be around 0.1 pixels and thus present only well below the 0.1% level proportional to the curvature ( derivative of derivative ) .      in harrington & kuhn 2007 , several systematic errors common in spectral reduction packages",
    "were explored .",
    "there are two main sources for error when calculating fractional differences : the wavelength alignment and the continuum subtraction of the 8 spectra .",
    "the major source of error when calculating polarization with strong lines is typically the wavelength alignment .",
    "this was thoroughly explored in harrington & kuhn 2007 . however , in the course of the observations some additional continuum subtraction errors were noticed in some extremely strong lines .",
    "this continuum effect will be explored in this section .",
    "the continuum subtraction in many packages , such as libre esprit , is done by fitting a low order polynomial over a spectral order . in the single - line reduction package , a simple linear fit to the continuum on either side of the line is used , just like in the standard iraf package .",
    "each of the 8 polarized spectra that are used to calculate q and u have the continuum normalized independently by dividing each spectrum by the linear continuum fit .",
    "depending on the width of the line and the number of pixels selected , these fits are typically robust to 1% or better .",
    "this continuum normalization eliminates the telescope induced continuum polarization , as well as any intrinsic polarization . also , since this subtraction centers all normalized continuum values to 1 , the polarized flux calculation no longer gives the actual flux of polarized light .",
    "it gives the deviation from continuum which can be a positive or negative value .",
    "figure [ fig : pfx - pcyg ] shows an example of the polarized flux calculated for a single observation on 9 - 20 - 2007 .",
    "a 1-pixel derivative error , the middle curve in the figure , shows the amplitude of the wavelength errors that are subtracted by the reduction package , leaving the essentially featureless polarized flux as the top curve .",
    "the systematic error arises when calculating the degree of polarization , a 1/i normalized quantity , when this polarized flux is not properly centered at zero .",
    "this featureless curve , when normalized by a strongly varying line profile can give rise to a 1/i type of error .",
    "when dividing a featureless line by the p cygni profile , the absorptive trough with it s small numbers , amplifies the continuum error and falsely gives a high degree of polarization while the emission peak reduces the error .    in order to illustrate this effect , a simulated continuum error , @xmath61 ,",
    "is implemented as a constant offset to a spectrum with this formula :    @xmath62    we find that this error can cause significant polarization effects across strong emission lines when @xmath61 is near 0.01 . in order to be certain that a polarization effect is real , an examination of the polarized flux",
    "must be done to ensure that the continuum fitting has been done properly .",
    "since the widths of the emission lines in our targets varies greatly , there are atmospheric water vapor lines near h@xmath0 , and there are other emission lines in the area , this is best done by visual inspection .",
    "the next step in the instrument development was calibrating the instrumental polarization response",
    ". absolute polarization at all wavelengths requires very careful calibration of the telescope .",
    "internal optics can induce or reduce polarization ( u , q@xmath27i or i@xmath27q , u ) in the beam , cause cross - talk between polarization states ( qu@xmath27v , v@xmath27qu ) , and also rotate the plane of polarization ( q@xmath27u , u@xmath27q ) . for an instrument at the coud focus of an alt - az telescope , all of these effects are functions of wavelength , altitude and azimuth . for aeos , there are five 45@xmath7 reflections before the coud room , two of which change their relative orientation .",
    "this is particularly severe , and only a few put a spectropolarimeter after so many mirrors .",

    "snchez almeida et al . 1991 , kuhn et al , 1994 , giro et al . 2003 )    since there are no spectropolarimetric standards one usually observes polarimetric standards that have a precise polarization value averaged over some bandpass such as hsu & breger 1982 , gil - hutton & benavidez 2003 , schmidt & elston 1992 , fossati et al . 2007 .",
    "the calibration and creation of a telescope model is done by measuring unpolarized standard stars and polarized sources at many pointings to calibrate the effects of the moving mirrors .",
    "in general , the telescope will have different responses to linearly polarized light since the absorption coefficients of the optical components vary with wavelength and the differential absorption is a function of the angle of the incident polarization with respect to the mirror / component axes .",
    "zeemax models of the telescope were used to compute the assumed polarization properties of the coud focus given various optical constants for aluminum .",
    "these show the expected altitude - azimuth dependence of the mueller - matrix terms , though the amplitudes of the computed effects are significantly different than measured .",
    "while the models can calculate the full mueller matrix as functions of altitude , azimuth , and wavelength , all of these terms can not be practically measured . however , certain parts of the mueller matrix can be measured given proper sources ( polarized standards , unpolarized standards , and scattered sunlight ) .",
    "unpolarized standard stars are the first tool used to calibrate the telescope .",
    "observations of these standards at as many pointings as possible allows one to construct a model of the telescopes response to unpolarized light and to quantify the telescope - induced polarization ( but not the depolarization , cross - talk , or plane rotation which requires a linearly polarized standard ) .",

    "this equation describes the polarization of light scattered by a single cloud in terms of the amount of incident flux multiplied by the degree of polarization and amount of light scattered to the detector all normalized by the total stellar flux received at the detector .    when the cloud lies directly between the disk of the star and the observer , optical pumping",
    "can cause the absorbed light to be polarized .",
    "all the light removed from the beam appears as a polarized absorption feature in the spectrum .",
    "since the absorbed light is scattered into all directions the absorption can polarize a much larger fraction of the light .",
    "this absorptive geometry can lead to a larger polarized optical signal .",
    "if @xmath77 then the relative transmitted polarized flux , @xmath78 , normalized to the total , is :    @xmath79    here @xmath80 is the absorptive ( optically pumped ) intrinsic polarization which is computed below .",
    "it will shown explicitly how this term is computed in the following sections .",
    "typically this term is a small fraction of a percent and is no more than 1% . the intrinsic scattered and absorbed polarization , @xmath76 and @xmath80 , are due to population differences in , respectively , the upper and lower level magnetic substates , and to the anisotropy of the scattered or pumping radiation .",
    "the ratio of absorbed to scattered polarization is computed as :    @xmath81    the relation @xmath67=1 has been used . since the cloud lies above the star , @xmath68 is always larger than @xmath67 . in general , this alone illustrates the regimes where the absorptive effects dominate .",
    "in low optical depth cases , the fraction ( 1-f)/f is quite large .",
    "the further away the cloud is , the larger the ratio ( though in absolute terms both scattered and absorbed fluxes decrease ) . it is shown below that the typical absorbed polarized fraction is less than 0.01 while scattered flux can approach 1 for clouds very close to the photosphere near the limb .",
    "as an example , the ratio for a cloud one stellar radii off the photosphere ( d=2 ) absorbing near the limb will be computed at the maximum possible scattering angle . in this geometry",
    ", the cloud will be at a scattering angle of @xmath82 and the star will subtend @xmath83 . from chapter 7 , if simple rayleigh scattering is assumed , the degree of polarization can be calculated as the ratio q / i from the scattering phase matrix :    @xmath84    for simplicity , we ll assume that the absorptive polarized fraction is 0.01 and that the optical depth is 0.1 . in this case",
    "the ratio of absorbed to scattered polarization is high :    @xmath85    in this case , the optical - pumping polarization effect will dominate any scattered polarization .",
    "now , this simple example ignores the entire spatial distribution of scattering and absorbing particles , but does provide a compelling reason to explore polarized absorption as an alternative to scattering polarization . for optically thin cases where the clouds are a few stellar radii away from the photosphere , this absorptive effect has just as much effect as the light scattered by the same cloud .",
    "our calculation is a very simplified version the general problem .",
    "this example assumes that the `` cloud '' has a small line - of - sight velocity with respect to the star and have ignored doppler shifts or the spectral dependence of the stellar source . in realistic cases where the absorption is on top of an emission line , it is not stellar continuum radiation , but h@xmath0 emission that optically pumps the intervening gas . in general",
    "this enhances the optical pumping ( since h@xmath0 can be significantly brighter than continuum ) and complicates the geometry because the pumping source is a broad region with significant spectral dependence and doppler shifts induced by cloud motion . however , since this cloud only produces polarization at the specific wavelength where there is absorption , there is less difficulty explaining profiles where emission and continuum polarizations are identical .",
    "it is not the redistribution of polarized light , taking polarization from one wavelength and moving it to another , but the absorption itself which imprints the polarization .",
    "thus the discussion here applies directly to the outflowing wind configuration of , for example , ab aur . in this model , absorption causes polarization and the emission line can remain unpolarized . the absorptive polarization fraction from statistical equilibrium",
    "will be computed below followed by specific solutions .      in order to compute the intrinsic absorptive polarization amplitude @xmath86",
    ", the statistical equilibrium equation must be solved for the densities of the first 28 ( ls coupled ) hydrogen energy levels corresponding to all of the principal quantum numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 sublevels .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath89 ) consists of an @xmath90 doublet .",
    "the @xmath91 levels include two @xmath92 and one @xmath93 states for a total of 8 magnetic substates .",
    "similarly there are 18 @xmath94 sublevels .",
    "a 28@xmath2428 matrix statistical equilibrium equation is constructed from the radiative transition rates .",
    "note that collisional transitions are unimportant in the density regimes of interest here .",

    "for a limb - darkened illuminating stellar disk where @xmath101 and @xmath102 , obtain factors @xmath103 that multiply the pumping blackbody background radiation terms in the rate equation . when the theoretical limb - darkening coefficients from al - naimiy ( 1978 ) are included , the coefficients can be written as :    @xmath104    @xmath105    anisotropy of the illuminating stellar light source leads to a difference in the @xmath106 and @xmath107 populations within the @xmath108 level .",
    "this lower state anisotropy linearly polarizes the transmitted light from the star which passes through the cloud at a non - zero angle , @xmath51 , with respect to the @xmath109 ( optical pumping ) direction .",
    "given the geometry defined by figure [ fig : pumpgeo ] , one expects the emergent light to be partially polarized with electric field perpendicular to the plane of the figure .",
    "most astronomical observations do not resolve the fine structure of the @xmath110 to @xmath111 h@xmath0 line but they will still exhibit a diluted linear polarization signal because only some of the transitions are insensitive to the pumping radiation anisotropy such as those which start and end on @xmath92 levels .",
    "the stokes transfer equation simplifies in the geometry where the stellar photosphere is a background light source and the intervening cloud is optically thin .",
    "take the positive stokes @xmath112 direction to correspond to light with electric field perpendicular to the plane of figure [ fig : pumpgeo ] .",
    "the stokes vector transfer equation ( eq . 11.1 in stenflo 1994 ) involves only @xmath113 and @xmath112 intensity , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 continuum - normalized opacity terms .",
    "since the stellar photospheric background is the only source of photons observed through the cloud , there are no source or emissivity terms to consider in the polarized transfer equation .",
    "typically , only small polarization ( @xmath116 ) is found in the stellar systems . in this approximation",
    ", the transfer equation reveals that light transmitted through a diameter of the cloud will have polarization :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the normalizing continuum opacity . here",
    "@xmath113 is the continuum intensity and one can compute @xmath119 from the lower level population anisotropies and eqns",
    ". 3.74 ( stenflo 1994 ) . in this case",
    "the effective refractive index and opacity terms @xmath120 or h@xmath121 ( eqn 4.41 ) are computed from sums of the products of the @xmath96 coefficients and the sublevel populations , derived separately for the @xmath122 and @xmath98 transitions . the optical depth through the cloud",
    "is just @xmath123 where @xmath75 is the fraction of h@xmath0 photons scattered , as defined above . for clouds with typical path lengths of roughly @xmath124 ,",
    "the optically thin condition yields hydrogen densities that are effectively collisionless .    in the low density conditions of this disk /",
    "wind the statistical equilibrium rate equation depends on only stimulated emission , absorption , and spontaneous emission processes .",
    "it is the difference in the angular dependence of the @xmath125 versus @xmath126 coupling to the anisotropic radiation field that leads to differences in the degenerate @xmath110 magnetic sublevel populations .",
    "several qualitative features of the optical pumping solutions are intuitive . for intense pumping radiation fields",
    "the anisotropy yields a decreasing absorptive polarization  in this regime the spontaneous emission is negligible and the net upward and downward transition rates between any two levels must be the same . in this case",
    "the equilibrium level populations are independent of the upward / downward transition rates .",
    "consequently there can be no sublevel density differences and the absorptive polarization must vanish . similarly for weak radiation fields it is the spontaneous emission that defines transition rates and this term in the rate equation does not depend on the radiation anisotropy .",
    "thus at low and high radiation backgrounds the absorptive polarization approaches zero .",
    "the absorptive polarization near h@xmath0 is also a function of the ratio of the h@xmath0 to @xmath127 ( and @xmath128 ) pumping flux .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath129 to @xmath92 populations affects the net h@xmath0 polarization , since only the @xmath93 states are sensitive to radiation anisotropy . in the limit of no background h@xmath0 flux ( and in the absence of collisions ) all the hydrogen ends up in the `` sterile '' @xmath130 state because it has no decay route and there is no radiative absorption to depopulate it .",
    "conversely , as the pumping h@xmath0 flux increases the equilibrium @xmath131 levels are populated and the induced linear polarization can increase .",
    "this results in a rather weak temperature dependence of the optical pumping source on the absorptive polarization . even though a decreasing source temperature decreases the pumping radiation , this effect on the polarization is compensated by the increasing ratio of h@xmath0 to @xmath127 flux . for a photospheric temperature between 30,000 to 3,000k , a change in pumping flux by nearly 4 orders of magnitude",
    ", the absorptive polarization is nearly constant .",
    "for example , a cloud located 1.1 stellar radii from a 30,000k star ( @xmath132 ) that is @xmath133 from the line - of - sight to the center of the star , yields linear polarization of 0.53% .",
    "if the star has a temperature of 3000k the polarization only decreases to 0.48% .    for fixed radiation mean intensity , as the pumping half - cone angle ( @xmath97 ) increases the anisotropy decreases and the polarization decreases .",
    "this effect continues until @xmath134 , at which point there is no difference between the dipole coupling of radiation to @xmath98 and @xmath99 transitions .",
    "the actual level population difference scales with @xmath97 as the difference between the derived geometric radiation coupling coefficients @xmath135 and @xmath136 defined above .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this varies like @xmath137 at small angles .",
    "thus the linear polarization @xmath138 for small cone angles ( even though the anisotropy increases ) .",
    "this is because the pumping radiation intensity declines rapidly with @xmath139 ( where @xmath68 is in units of the stellar radius ) as the cloud - star distance increases .",
    "figure [ fig : pumpdist ] shows how the linear polarization varies for a cloud seen at the projected edge of a star , as a function of the cloud - star distance , @xmath68 . at small distances from the star",
    "the limb darkening function yields significant anisotropy that keeps the polarization from going to zero .",
    "the absorptive polarization depends strongly on the angle between the absorbed beam and the mean pumping direction . as this angle ( @xmath51 ) increases the polarization perpendicular to the plane increases .",
    "for example , with a @xmath140 source temperature and a @xmath141 cone angle the polarization increases almost linearly from @xmath142 to @xmath143 as @xmath51 varies from @xmath142 to @xmath141 .      with this new theory ,",
    "detailed forward solutions for a wide range of circumstellar conditions can be developed . here , the general form of the wavelength dependent linear polarization expected from intervening wind or disk structures will be computed .",
    "consider two geometries ; a radial outflow and orbiting material illuminated ( optically pumped ) by the stellar blackbody . by calculating polarization for clouds at a fixed distance from the photosphere ,",
    "the polarization imprinted by a ring of material , much like the examples in chapter 7 can be traced .",
    "the geometry is essentially that defined in figure [ fig : pumpgeo ] but allow that the wind or disk s symmetry axis is inclined at an angle @xmath144 with respect to the line - of - sight to the star .",
    "choose the common plane containing the line - of - sight direction and the symmetry axis to be oriented vertically .",
    "then , as seen from the observer , the intervening clouds , a ring of material at a fixed distance , projects onto a horizontally oriented arc across the stellar disk .",
    "the ring of material is both illuminated by the star and absorbs the stellar light .",
    "each point on this arc contributes absorptive polarization at a distinct velocity with respect to the observer .",
    "we take positive stokes @xmath112 along the vertical sky direction .",
    "positive @xmath145 corresponds to an electric field that is @xmath146 to this .",
    "it follows that the absorptive polarization of a symmetric radial wind should yield only @xmath147 polarization at all velocities .",
    "every cloud producing non - vertical polarization on one side of the photosphere will have another cloud on the other side with mirrored geometry , canceling any non - vertical polarization .",
    "figure [ fig : pumpdist ] shows the degree of polarization calculated for a cloud projected on the limb , the geometry of maximum polarization , assuming star with a simple black - body spectrum with a temperature of 10,000k .",
    "this degree of polarization is fixed by the quantum - mechanical properties of hydrogen gas , the intensity of the radiation and the geometry .",
    "the velocity of the cloud , in contrast to the scattering models , only influences the wavelength of the absorption and does not produce other doppler effects .",
    "the optical - pumping effect in disky systems has symmetric and anti - symmetric components as seen in figure [ fig : pumpcalc ] .",
    "in contrast to scattering theory , even a homogeneous rotating disk geometry must exhibit non - zero @xmath148 and @xmath149 line profiles because of the angular difference between the line of sight and radial directions in every point along the orbit .",
    "the zero line - of - sight velocity condition for orbiting material occurs along the vertical symmetry line in the center of the h@xmath0 line . for any non - zero angle between source and line - of - sight",
    ", there is polarization . the characteristic symmetric stokes @xmath148 and antisymmetric stokes",

    "these are plotted against units of the maximum rotation or outflow velocity of the disk or wind .",
    "the polarization is maximum when the material projects against the limb ( largest asymmetry ) on both the approaching and receding sides of the disk .",
    "the absorptive polarization outside of these plotted points must be zero , but spectral smoothing due to the finite spectral resolution of real measurements will yield some polarization outside of the absorptive region .",
    "the exact spectropolarimetric morphology caused by this inclined ring of material would be a double - peaked stokes @xmath148 and anti - symmetric @xmath149 . in qu - space",
    ", this would correspond to two separate excursions , one toward ( + q,+u ) and then another toward ( + q ,- u ) .",
    "however , the extensions would not be orthogonal because of the different amplitudes of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 signatures .",
    "the extensions would also not be exactly linear because of the differing curvature of the signatures .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pumpcalc ] we ve plotted the stokes @xmath148 polarization across the velocity distribution of an outflow .",
    "the ring of material is assumed to have a spatially constant radial velocity and the velocity distribution has been normalized by the maximum projected outflow velocity .",
    "the outflow has it s maximum projected velocity ( blue - shift ) closest the line of sight .",
    "this occurs at the left - most portion of the curve , with zero polarization and a relative velocity of -1 .",
    "the cloud occulting the limb is at the minimum relative velocity , in this case at a velocity near -0.5 and a polarization of roughly 0.35% .",
    "stokes @xmath149 must be zero , as can be seen in the anti - symmetry of stokes @xmath149 for the disk calculation .",
    "clouds that had the same magnitude velocity with opposite signs in the disk case will now have the same projected velocity in the wind case .",
    "this would leave only a stokes @xmath148 signature that would correspond to a linear extension in qu - space .",
    "though neither of these calculations accounts for extended h@xmath0 source regions , a non - black - body stellar source , or other complications , the illustration shows that the main optical - pumping effects are easily interpreted .",
    "the polarization is less than 1% of the continuum flux , polarization is only present where there is absorption , and the polarization is greatest where the absorbing material projects with maximum angular deviation between pumping source and line - of - sight directions .    though this simple calculation is only illustrative ,",
    "the essential characteristics of optical pumping in a wind - type geometry can be inferred .",
    "the polarization will be highest for the parts of the h@xmath0 line occulting the source with greatest asymmetries . in stars with with extended h@xmath0 emission ,",
    "the maximum polarization occurs at the wavelengths of highest angular difference between the incident radiation and line - of - sight .",
    "the degree of polarization is fixed by the quantum - mechanics - this effect will not produce extremely large polarizations and has a characteristic degree of polarization around 1% continuum or less . although most real stellar disks and outflows are not expected to be homogeneous in density or velocity , in general a non - zero @xmath149 polarization is expected ( and observed ) which , of course , depends on the rotation angle between the instrument @xmath112-axis and the star as well as any geometrical complexities .",
    "the zero polarization level is also ill - defined in the observations since a wavelength independent constant has been removed from all observations and interstellar , telescope , and intrinsic polarization are difficult to disentangle with the hivis observations .",
    "nevertheless the polarization amplitude and simple form of many herbig ae / be detections is consistent with the  diamond \" symbols in figure [ fig : pumpcalc ] .",
    "the polarization is only in the blue - shifted , absorbed component of the h@xmath0 line , and there is a characteristic amplitude of less than 1% continuum .",
    "this new model shows how optical pumping can describe spectropolarimetric effects with the magnitude and form of the absorptive linear polarization features in some herbig ae / be systems .",
    "the variation of stokes @xmath148 and @xmath149 near absorptive components of the h@xmath0 line originates in this model from the intervening gas cloud projected against the disk of the star and the emission region .",
    "the polarization features contain information on the kinematics and inclination of the cloud .",
    "one immediate conclusion from these calculations is that the absorptive region is near the surface of the star , most likely within 2 stellar radii in order to have a polarization amplitude of about 0.5% .",
    "the main properties of this model is that polarization is present only where there is absorption .",
    "the polarization is maximal where there is greatest asymmetry between the line - of - sight and the source direction .",
    "the quantum - mechanical properties of hydrogen put the amplitude of the polarization effects at typically a fraction of a percent ( continuum ) . for constrained geometries",
    "it may be possible to devise an inversion technique to extract more specific information on non - homogeneous cloud structures in the innermost regions of these stellar systems .",
    "no attempt has been made to include extended h@xmath0 emission regions or other circumstellar complications , but the main framework for polarization - in - absorption is complete .",

    "many methods of testing and verifying were used .",
    "a dedicated reduction script was developed for this instrument .",

    "polarization calibration optics were installed on the spectrograph and response tests were performed .",
    "the spectrograph optics were shown to be quite stable .",
    "polarized flat field measurements showed that the spectropolarimeter could measure linear polarization very accurately over the full useful wavelength range of the polarizer .",
    "the spectrograph induces a small amount of polarization in unpolarized light and this polarization is wavelength - dependent .",
    "this is automatically corrected by the reduction software .",
    "the polarization properties of the entire optical system was explored using unpolarized standard stars and highly polarized twilight .",
    "the polarization properties of the telescope are quite severe and complicated .",
    "the effect of on detected spectropolarimetric signatures can be quite significant .",
    "however , the telescope can not induce any effects across a single spectral line . in effect",
    ", the telescope can reduce the overall magnitude of a spectropolarimetric effect , or rotate the plane of polarization .",
    "the telescope can not create a spectropolarimetric signature or modify the morphology of the signature .",
    "thus , any spectropolarimetric signature detected is a useful lower limit on the magnitude of the polarization change across a line .    in order to verify and validate the instrument and the results of the survey , a large cross - examination campaign was performed and presented in chapter 5 .",
    "nearly simultaneous observations of a few stars were performed with hivis and the espadons spectropolarimeters .",

    "chapter 7 outlined the current theory of spectropolarimetric line profiles , based on disk - scattering effects .",
    "the current theory predicts symmetric , broad , double - peaked spectropolarimetric signatures in the orbiting thin - disk case . in the case of outward radial motion ,",
    "the disk - scattering theory predicts a shifting of the spectropolarimetric profiles toward the red side of the spectral line .",
    "other spectropolarimetric effects , such as the depolarization effect and zeeman splitting were discussed .",
    "the depolarization theory is essentially a dilution of continuum polarization by unpolarized emission .",
    "this effect produces broad signatures that are roughly inversely proportional to the amount of emission .",
    "magnetic fields produce a more complex spectropolarimetric signature and other studies have shown that the field strengths of these stars is far too small to produce any measurable spectropolarimetric effect .    in chapter 8 , the spectropolarimetric survey of the herbig",
    "ae / be stars was presented .",
    "the survey showed that roughly two thirds of the windy - type stars showed polarization effects in the blue - shifted absorptive components of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "half of the disky - type stars also showed this polarization - in - absorption effect in the line - center absorptive component .",
    "the magnitude of the effect was typically 0.1% to 2% with several stars showing complex morphologies and complex geometries in qu - space .",
    "only one star showed a spectropolarimetric effect across the entire h@xmath0 line .",
    "these observations are difficult to explain using current scattering theories .",
    "the depolarization effect causes a broad , monotonic change in polarization that is roughly inversely proportional to emission and is a linear extension in qu - space .",
    "the disk - scattering effect shows broad , symmetric morphology for orbiting material and a shift toward red wavelengths for out - flowing material . both of these effects do not fit the observed morphology of polarization - in - absorption on the blue - shifted side of the windy - stars or the polarization - in - central - absorption - only for the disky - stars .",
    "the amplitude of the observed effects is also a consideration .",
    "scattering theory has no natural amplitude , but most of the detections fall in the 0.3% to 1.5% range .    in order to solidify the case for exploring new alternative theories , a smaller survey of 30",
    "be and emission - line stars was performed and presented in chapter 9 .",
    "these be and emission - line stars had a very different type of spectropolarimetric morphology . in 10 of 30 stars there was a broad , monotonic spectropolarimetric signature present across the entire h@xmath0 line .",
    "this type of signature is typical of the depolarization effect .",
    "however , of these 10 broad detections , many showed more complex morphologies than a simple depolarization .",
    "in another 5 of 30 stars there were antisymmetric or other more complex spectropolarimetric signatures .",
    "this smaller survey is in good agreement with the collection of previous work done to date on these stars .",
    "the broad morphology is reproduced , but the higher resolution , higher signal - to - noise and larger sample of this survey shows that there are still some uncertainties about the exact form of the spectropolarimetric effects .    the inability of the scattering theories to fit the  polarization - in - absorption \" seen in the herbig ae / be stars provided the motivation for developing a new theory for spectropolarimetric line profiles .",
    "this new theory is based on optical pumping - a method for producing polarization simply from absorption .",
    "this new theory is outlined in chapter 10 .",
    "an anisotropic radiation source can induce an imbalance in the sub - states of an atomic transition .",
    "for instance , the h@xmath0 line is an n=3 to n=2 energy - level transition with many allowed sub - states in both levels .",
    "if the hydrogen gas is optically pumped by the stellar radiation , this non - isotropic gas will have a polarization - dependent absorption . in the circumstellar environment ,",
    "radiative transitions dominate collisions and this effect can be much larger than scattering effects .",
    "when this theory is implemented in a simple thin - disk case , just as for scattering theory , there is only polarization where there is absorption and the spectropolarimetric effect is greatest at the wavelengths corresponding to the greatest angle between the line of sight and the absorbing material . although detailed models to predict spectropolarimetric line profiles in the complicated environments have not yet been explored , this new theory has a very clear link between spectrpolarimetric effects and absorption .",
    "this new model shows promise in explaining the large collection of herbig ae / be observations .",

    "<S> the near - star environment around young stars is very dynamic with winds , disks , and outflows . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are involved in star and planet formation , and influence the formation and habitability of planets around host stars . even for the closest young stars </S>",
    "<S> , this will not be imaged by the next generation of telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> other proxies must be developed to probe the circumstellar environment .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of light across individual spectral lines is such a proxy that contains information about the circumstellar material on small spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> many models have been created to relate the circumstellar environment to observable polarization changes across spectral lines . however , measuring signals at the 0.1% level requires a very careful control of systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> we have recently built a high - resolution spectropolarimeter for the hivis spectrograph on the 3.67 m aeos telescope to address these issues .    </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a large number of high precision spectropolarimetric observations of herbig ae / be , classical be and other emission - line stars collected on 117 nights of observations . </S>",
    "<S> many stars showed systematic variations in the linear polarization amplitude and direction as a function of time and wavelength in the h@xmath0 line . </S>",
    "<S> the detected linear polarization varies from our typical detection threshold near @xmath1 up to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in several stars this polarization effect is _ not _ coincident with the h@xmath0 emission peak but is detected only in the absorptive part of the line profile and varies with the absorption . </S>",
    "<S> these detections are largely inconsistent with the traditional scattering models and inspired a new explanation of their polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> we developed a new spectropolarimetric model and argue that polarization in absorption is evidence of optical pumping . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , while scattering theory fits many be and emission - line star observations , this new theory has much more potential to explain polarization - in - absorption as seen in herbig ae / be and other stellar systems .    </S>",
    "<S> this thesis presents a large spectropolarimetric study that combines new instrumentation , custom processing software , thorough calibrations , cross - instrument comparisons , a massive observing campaign on many targets larger than most studies to date combined , comparison of current theories on multiple objects and finally the creation of a new theory . </S>"
