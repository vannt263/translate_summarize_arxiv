    "the study of relations between the zero distribution of an analytic function and its growth is likely to be one of the most basic problems of complex analysis .",

    "namely , for @xmath3 , one has @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the zero set of @xmath6 counting multiplicities . hence",

    "of course , the study of the zero distribution of analytic functions from other classes is much more involved ; see , for instance , papers of korenblum @xcite on the zero distribution for functions from spaces @xmath18 .",
    "interesting results on zeros of functions from some bergman - type spaces are given in seip @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned spaces of analytic functions are defined with the help of a radial ( i.e. , invariant with respect to rotations of the unit disk ) growth conditions . however , it turns out that one often needs to deal with classes of analytic functions subject to _ non - radial _ growth relations .",
    "these classes appear , in particular , if one wants to study the distribution of the discrete spectrum of non - self - adjoint perturbations for certain self - adjoint or unitary operators .",
