    "figure [ fig : cube]b shows high - redshift galaxies have significantly larger velocity dispersions than lower redshift objects of similar stellar mass .",
    "most of our mosfire objects have similar dispersions , @xmath65 km s @xmath15 , with the exception of 4126 ( shown as an open symbol ) .",
    "this galaxy is the only post - starburst object in our sample , and presents an elongated morphology and low srsic  index , @xmath66 , typical of disk - like galaxies .",
    "velocity dispersions enable us to calculate dynamical masses , via @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig : cube]c compares the dynamical and stellar masses , again contrasting the trend with samples drawn from the literature . while the @xmath68 sample closely follows the local distribution , @xmath1 galaxies tend to have higher stellar - to - dynamical mass ratios . this difference was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite , but as our mosfire sample doubles the number of dynamical masses with @xmath1 , it is now more significant , particularly as our velocity dispersions are more accurate .",
    "we calculate the average mass ratio for all the @xmath1 quiescent galaxies , excluding the bcg , and we find @xmath2 and an average stellar mass of @xmath69 . although our sample is modest , this is a remarkably tight agreement .",
    "considering the most massive galaxies of the @xmath40 sample , we find @xmath70 and an average mass of @xmath71",
    ". this significant evolution could arise if @xmath1 quiescent galaxies have a reduced dark matter fraction , a heavier stellar imf or different structure compared to their lower - redshift counterparts .",
    "we now use our dynamical masses to infer the rate of size growth for high - redshift quiescent galaxies .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that we can link progenitor and descendant galaxies by selecting populations at _ fixed velocity dispersion_. this follows the results of numerical simulations that show that velocity dispersion is minimally affected during merger events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the observed unchanging velocity dispersion function @xcite . for each of our @xmath1 objects ,",
    "we therefore select sdss galaxies with similar velocity dispersions ( within 0.05 dex ) .",
    "we calculate the median size of the local subsample and assume that our high redshift object will grow in size until it reaches that value .",
    "we repeat this procedure for lower - redshifts samples and show the inferred growth rates in the left panel of figure [ fig : fixedsigma ] .",
    "typical @xmath1 galaxies are noticeably smaller than those at @xmath68 , despite the small interval in cosmic time between the two samples .",
    "our results are qualitatively in agreement with the size growth at _ fixed number density _ derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* violet line ) .",
    "interestingly , the growth of individual galaxies is not dissimilar to that of the total population derived from the evolution of the mass - size relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* red line ) .",
    "although minor merging is likely responsible for the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at @xmath72 , such a rapid growth at @xmath51 is hard to reconcile with the observed merger rate ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : fixedsigma ] we show the mass - size relation for galaxies with @xmath73 at all redshifts .",
    "this velocity dispersion bin includes all the @xmath1 galaxies except the post - starburst object 4126 .",
    "the local population forms a clear sequence whereas objects at intermediate redshifts show a mild offset towards smaller sizes ( and masses ) .",
    "however , the @xmath1 galaxies populate a distinct region of the mass - size plane with almost no overlap with lower redshift samples ; almost all have radii 0.3 dex below the local sample .",
    "the inescapable conclusion is that quiescent galaxies at @xmath1 must undergo a dramatic and rapid size growth .",
    "a powerful method to constrain the physical processes responsible for this size growth is to measure the slope @xmath74 of the evolutionary tracks on the mass - size plane and compare it with theoretical predictions .",
    "simple virial arguments @xcite give @xmath75 for identical mergers and @xmath76 for the limiting case of mergers with infinitely diffuse satellites .",
    "more realistic numerical simulations , which include the effect of dark matter , gas , and a distribution of orbits , indicate that minor mergers are less efficient than the theoretical limit , and yield values in the range @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , in which massive dark matter halos enhance the efficiency of minor merging up to @xmath78 , are the only exception .",
    "however , the large dark matter fraction at the center of these simulated galaxies disagrees with the observed stellar - to - dynamical mass ratios at both low and high redshift .    assuming evolution at fixed velocity dispersion , we measure @xmath79 by considering the tracks that high - redshift points must follow in order to match the local distribution . using this technique , the @xmath68 sample yields @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "merging can therefore readily explain the size growth over @xmath81 , a conclusion supported by direct imaging @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath1 the growth is clearly much more rapid .",
    "it is not possible to derive a robust measurement of the slope @xmath79 for two reasons : firstly , our @xmath1 sample is not velocity dispersion complete ; secondly , one of our basic assumptions might not hold , since the velocity dispersion function has not been probed beyond @xmath82 . as the number density of quiescent galaxies declines steeply at this redshift , a strong progenitor bias is expected . despite these limitations , we can still derive an important lower limit on @xmath79 , by assuming that the average high - redshift galaxy ( shown in black , excluding the bcg ) will evolve into one of the most massive objects at @xmath83 . using this method , for all the @xmath1 quiescent galaxies excluding the bcg we derive a lower limit of @xmath84 , shown as a dashed line in the figure .    in summary , our spectroscopic data",
    "allows us to conclude that both the absolute rate of size growth _ and _ the inferred motion in the mass - size plane are independently inconsistent with minor mergers being the principal physical process governing the evolution of quiescent galaxies at @xmath51 .",
