    "strong gravitational lensing due to the dense cores of clusters of galaxies leads to the formation of multiple images and giant luminous arcs of background galaxies .",
    "the lensing observables such as image positions and flux - ratios in turn provide strong constraints on the underlying gravitational potential of the lensing clusters .",
    "the strongly lensed images of background galaxies have therefore been powerful observational tools to probe the mass distribution in cluster cores ( mellier et al .",

    "2005 ) .    exploring high-@xmath3 galaxies is extremely important for understanding unsolved physical properties of forming galaxies as well as understanding the cosmic reionization history .",
    "the bottleneck is that such high-@xmath3 forming galaxies are too faint to be observed with present - day telescopes due to the @xmath4-dependence of the surface - brightness dimming effect .",
    "the most promising method is to utilize the gravitational magnification by clusters as a biggest natural telescope  gravitational lens telescope ( ellis et al .",
    "2001 ; hu et al . 2002",
    "; kneib et al .",
    "furthermore , detailed study of high redshift galaxies can only be made for strongly lensed hence magnified galaxies ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "2002 on cb58 ) .    we have discovered a high-@xmath3 lensed galaxy during the course of spectroscopic follow - up of the rxj0152.7@xmath51357 cluster at @xmath1 as a part of our distant cluster project on the subaru called pisces ( kodama et al . 2005 ) . in this paper ,",
    "we present the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the newly discovered triple lensed images based on the observational data taken with the ground - based subaru telescope as well as on the data with the high - resolution archival advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . a gravitational lens model of the cluster mass distribution is developed for the three lensed images .",
    "throughout the paper we assume a @xmath6-dominated flat cosmology with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , and we use magnitudes given in the ab system .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps    the lensed objects were first found as those having very similar colors in @xmath9 based on the optical imaging with suprime - cam on the subaru telescope ( see kodama et al .",
    "2005 for details of the optical data ) .",
    "the photometric properties of the objects are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all the three objects show strong continuum breaks in the @xmath10 color ( @xmath11 with a relatively flat sed at longer wavelength regime .",
    "these photometric properties suggest that their redshifts are high ( @xmath12 ) in analogy to lyman break galaxies .",
    "we have conducted spectroscopic follow - up observations during 1114 october 2004 with focas ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2002 ) in the mos mode .",
    "we used a 300 lines @xmath13 grating blazed at 5500 @xmath14 with the order - cut filter sy47 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was between 4700@xmath15 and 9400 @xmath15 with a pixel resolution of @xmath16 .",
    "a slit width was set to @xmath17 , which gave a resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "we obtained four 1800s exposures for each object nodded by @xmath19 for each shot .",
    "the object @xmath20 was slipped out of the slit for one shot due to the nodding , and the net exposure on this object is @xmath21s .",
    "data reduction was performed in a standard manner using _ iraf_. the objects @xmath22 and @xmath20 were very close to the spatial edge of the slits , and hence we will not discuss relative fluxes of these objects from the spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows the obtained spectra of the the three images under concern .",
    "all the three show a strong emission line around @xmath23 .",
    "the emission line profile for each object was fitted with a gaussian .",
    "the central wavelengths of the lines are 5992.41@xmath15 , 5991.95@xmath15 , and 5992.11@xmath15 for @xmath22 , @xmath20 , and @xmath24 , respectively , with a statistical error of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the objects lie at the same redshift within the errors . the objects @xmath22 and @xmath24 show a clear continuum break shortward of this line , although no such break is seen in @xmath20 due to the low _",
    "s / n_. no other lines are observed in the spectra .",
    "these objects are either ( 1 ) a gravitationally lensed ly@xmath26 emitter at @xmath27 or ( 2 ) foreground [ oii ] emitters at @xmath28 .",
    "the latter possibility is rejected , however .",
    "we observe no [ oiii ] lines at the expected wavelength as shown in fig .",
    "it is highly unlikely that galaxies show such a strong [ oii ] emission without any detectable [ oiii ] emission .",
    "the photometric properties of the objects are inconsistent with a @xmath28 galaxy either .",
    "their @xmath10 and @xmath29 colors are too red for their @xmath30 colors to be star forming galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore conclude that these objects are ly@xmath26 emitters at @xmath27 .",
    "note that the rms error in the redshifts is @xmath32 . in summary , these objects show very similar photometric properties and they lie at exactly the same redshift  these facts strongly suggest that they are originally a single galaxy strongly lensed by the foreground cluster at @xmath1 .",
    "we also obtained the `` on - the - fly '' processed hst / acs images of the field from the hst archive ( hst gto proposal 9290 : ford , h. ) .",

    "is scaled to @xmath58 .",
    "the cluster contains several mass clumps associated with the cluster galaxy concentrations . as the three images are located in between the cluster center and the north - east substructure ( mass clump b of jee et al . )",
    ", we take this clump into account in our lens model in the following way : we assume the clump mass of @xmath59 estimated by jee et al .",
    "is the virial mass of the clump .",
    "we then convert the mass into the 1-d velocity dispersion of an sis halo ( @xmath60 : see bartelmann , king , & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "accordingly , our model consists of one sie as the global cluster halo and one sis as the north - east substructure .",
    "we treat the sie parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath61 , @xmath26 ) and the ( un - lensed ) source position @xmath62 as free parameters of our lens model .",

    ", we use as constraints the thee image positions @xmath64 relative to the center of the sie halo ; we further include the flux ratio @xmath65 of the closer pair as it gives a strong constraint on the location of the critical curve . the @xmath63 is then given as @xmath66 ^ 2 }        { \\sigma_{i_2/i_1}^2 } , \\ ] ] where quantities with superscript m denote the model predictions , @xmath67 is the positional uncertainty of the multiple images , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the rms error of the flux ratio @xmath65 .",
    "the image positions @xmath70 of a source with the position @xmath62 are obtained by solving the lens equation @xmath71 ( schneider et al . 1992 ) with the effective lensing potential @xmath72 in sum of an sie and an sis potential .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the derived best - fit model of the rxj0152 lens system overlaied on the subaru image .",

    "the predicted source position is inside and close to a cusp caustic produced by the main cluster potential as expected .",
    "for such an image configuration , the image @xmath20 is predicted to have opposite parity as @xmath22 and @xmath24 . in particular , the closest images @xmath81 are mirror images of each other with respect to the critical curve ( see fig .",
    "the high - resolution acs images reveal more detailed structures of the lensed images that were not spatially resolved in the subaru images .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that the observed image parities are consistent with the lensing hypothesis : each image contains a bright core and extended emission with lower surface brightness , and a clear mirror symmetry between @xmath22 and @xmath20 is seen in the hst / acs data .",

    "accordingly , the predicted magnification ratios are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , whereas the flux ratios from the subaru @xmath89-band data are @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "our simple lens model thus reproduces correctly the observed flux ratio of @xmath65 while it fails for @xmath92 ; more than a factor 2 smaller than the observed flux ratio . in this study",

    "kneib et al .",
    "it is expected that the image @xmath24 could be easily magnified by local perturbers since its angular size ( see table 1 ) is sufficiently small compared with that of the lensing potential of possible perturbers ( chiba 2002 ) .",
    "the derived lens model allows us to inspect the intrinsic properties of the un - lensed source from the observed images . in what follows",
    ", we only refer to the images @xmath22 and @xmath20 for which our lens model can accurately reproduce the observations . from the predicted magnifications ,",
    "the magnitude of the un - lensed source is estimated as @xmath93 .",
    "this corresponds to a uv - luminosity of @xmath94 erg / s/@xmath14 or @xmath95 mag . from this",

    "the observed ly@xmath26 flux indicates sfr@xmath97 ( kennicutt 1998 ; brocklehurst 1971 ) , which is lower than sfr(1560@xmath14 ) .",
    "this is suggestive of dust extinction .",
    "further , the superb hst / acs angular resolution together with our lens model gives us size information of the source galaxy .",
    "the half - light radii @xmath98 of the lensed images are listed in table 1 ( flux_radius given by sextractor : bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "note that even for the acs images the fwhm of psf is comparable to that of the lensed images . taking this into account",
