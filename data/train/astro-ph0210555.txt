    "the opacity index @xmath105 appears to be appropriate between wavelengths of 650  microns and 2.7  mm for sub - micron to millimeter - sized grains expected in warm molecular clouds and young disks ( pollack et al .",
    "we assume the emission is optically thin and the temperature of the dust can be characterized by a single value . using values of @xmath106",
    "k and @xmath105 , we find the total mass of gas and dust associated with the 2.7  mm continuum emission is approximately 475  m ( table 1 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with those of shepherd ( 2001 ) and watson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to within the errors .",
    "the total molecular mass of outflowing gas from the mm  1 and mm  2 combined flows ( @xmath86  relative to @xmath5 ) is @xmath3  m. hunter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found @xmath107  with a rough scaling performed to take into account an optical depth correction .",
    "however , their image covered only the inner region of the flow so their estimate should be considered a lower limit .",
    "based on single dish observations of co(j=32 ) , davis et al ( 1998a ) estimated a total flow mass of @xmath108  , uncorrected for optical depth effects .",
    "this mass estimate is extremely high for an optically thin approximation .",
    "examination of their fig .",
    "11 , t@xmath109 vs. ( @xmath110 ) , shows that the blue - shifted lobe has an order of magnitude increase in the integrated flux at the velocity of dr  21 ( 2.5 ) .",
    "it appears that their single - dish map may have been significantly contaminated by emission from the dr  21 cloud , which introduced uncertainties in the mass and kinematics estimates .",
    "ridge & moore ( 2001 ) estimated the outflow mass of the red - shifted lobe only to be 273  based on a co(j=21 ) single dish image corrected for optical depth .",
    "the mass of blue - shifted gas was not estimated by ridge & moore due to the contamination by the dr  21 cloud .",
    "this value is significantly higher than our estimate and may be due to missing extended emission in the interferometer image , especially at low velocities . despite this problem , interferometric imaging also provided benefits : it was easier to distinguish between outflow gas and the dr  21 cloud and to identify flows from multiple sources in the cluster .    the total cloud core mass of w75  n has been estimated to be 18002500  based on observations at submillimeter wavelengths ( moore , mountain , & yamashita , 1991 ) and 1200  based on cs(j=76 ) emission ( hunter et al . 1994 ) . the gravitational binding energy of the cloud , @xmath111 , is 12@xmath112  ergs , where we take the radius @xmath113  pc ( moore et al .",
    "1991 ) and @xmath114 is a constant which depends on the mass distribution ( @xmath115 for @xmath116 ) . more than 10% of the molecular cloud is participating in the outflow and the combined outflow energy is roughly half the gravitation binding energy of the cloud .",
    "the observed w75  n outflows are injecting a significant amount of mechanical energy into the cloud core and may help prevent further collapse of the cloud .",
    "our co(j=10 ) images suggest that high - velocity gas is associated with at least two uc hii regions : vla  1  ( ba ) and vla  3  ( bb ) and an embedded source in the millimeter core mm  2 .",
    "the position angles of the individuals outflows are not aligned , ranging from 51  to 124 .",
    "the  morphology is diffuse and patchy both in the north - east and south - west .",
    "the irregular morphology of the infrared reflection nebula with fingers of nebulosity radiating out from the mm  1/mm  2 millimeter cores supports the conclusion that multiple energetic outflows are carving large cavities in the molecular cloud .",
    "low surface brightness  emission extends well beyond the co outflow while [ feii ] emission is only detected close to the protostellar cluster .",
    "it is generally believed that [ feii ] line emission associated with low - mass outflows requires the presence of fast , dissociative shocks that disrupt dust grains and release heavy elements just behind a jump - shock ( j - shock ) boundary .",
    "emission , on the other hand , appears to be produced in slow , non - dissociative j - type shocks ( e.g. hollenbach & mckee 1989 ; smith 1994 ; gredel 1994 ; beck - winchatz et al .",
    "continuous - shocks ( c - shocks ) can not easily produce emission from ionized species such as [ feii ] nor can they produce the observed column densities typically seen in toward herbig haro objects from low - mass protostars ( gredel 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , nisini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that there appears to be no correlation between  and [ feii ] emission in outflows from low - mass ysos which supports the interpretation that physically different mechanisms are responsible for producing  and [ feii ] emission . in a sample of herbig haro objects produced by jets from low - mass protostars , both  and [ feii ]",
    "is found toward all sources and the morphology of  and [ feii ] emission is similar on large scales although it differs in the detail ( gredel 1994 ; reipurth et al .",
    "these observations indicate that jets from low - mass protostars produce both fast , dissociative regions where [ feii ] emissions arises and slower , non - dissociative regions where  emission arises .",
    "in contrast , [ feii ] emission toward w75  n is only detected close to the central sources and does not show a jet - like morphology as in outflows from low- and intermediate - mass young stellar objects ( e.g. lorenzetti et al . 2002 ; nisini et al .",
    "2002 ; reipurth et al .",
    "the outflows from w75  n appear to exhibit only slow , non - dissociative j - type shocks which produce copious  emission throughout the outflow region but the fast , dissociative shocks responsible for [ feii ] emission are absent in the outer regions of the flow .",
    "instead , the diffuse [ feii ] line emission in w75  n is coincident with the brightest k@xmath2-band reflection nebulosity .",
    "one possibility may be that the [ feii ] emission traces photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) along cloud surfaces illuminated by the massive protostars in the mm  1 core .",
    "this situation is also observed in the orion bar pdr ( e.g. walmsley et al .",
    "2000 ) suggesting that the w75  n nebula may exhibit similar excitation conditions to those in orion .    the  and [ feii ] line emission in w75",
    "n does not conform to what is expected for shock - excited emission resulting from the interaction between a well - collimated jet and diffuse molecular gas . in this respect ,",
    "the physical characteristics of the w75  n flows differ from their low - mass counterparts which produce collimated jets observed in both  and [ feii ] emission .",
    "many previous authors have assumed that only vla  1 ( ba ) was in an outflow stage based on the elongated morphology of the ionized gas , the presence of  maser emission along the uc hii region axis , and because the position angles of the ionized gas and the co emission were similar .",
    "maser emission is also associated with vla  2 and vla  3  ( bb ) as well as mm  3 and mm  2 , however , outflowing material could not be traced to specific sources . assuming a single primary driving source for the co gas , davis et al .",
    "( 1998b ) suggested that the south - west co red - shifted lobe and  morphology supports a bow - shock entrainment scenario for a molecular outflow driven by a jet from a single massive star .",
    "our co and millimeter continuum observations do not support this theory that a single source drives the high - velocity co gas .",
    "further , our infrared observations suggest that the w75  n outflows are not likely to be scaled - up versions of jet - driven outflows from low - mass protostars .",
    "a question remains unanswered by this work : what source powers the 3  pc flow at p.a .",
    "the flow mass is @xmath117  m , the dynamical age is roughly @xmath118  years , and the mass loss rate @xmath119 to @xmath120  m@xmath121  yr@xmath30 .",
    "the flow parameters are consistent with those produced by an early b protostar .",
    "hutawarakorn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have modeled the oh maser position - velocity data and find evidence for a massive disk centered on vla  2 ( m@xmath122  m  with p.a .",
    "= 155 , roughly perpendicular to the outflow axis ) . a high - velocity , time - variable oh maser cluster is coincident with vla  2 suggesting an outflow origin .",
    "further , recent observations with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) show that a clump of strong maser emission with high velocity dispersion is centered on vla  2 ( torrelles et al . 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the oh and maser activity suggests vla  2 is producing a powerful outflow .",
    "although our observations did not have adequate resolution to isolate high - velocity gas toward vla  2 , we have determined that vla  1  ( ba ) , vla  3  ( bb ) , and mm  2 are not likely to drive the 3  pc flow that dominates the region dynamics .",
    "thus , it is possible that vla  2 may drive the large - scale flow .",
    "follow - up observations at a resolution less than @xmath88 will be required to determine if , in fact , vla  2 drives the 3  pc flow .",
    "based on the size and velocity of the co outflows from the w75  n ( b ) uc hii regions , the region is @xmath123  years old .",
    "w75  n ( a ) is more evolved than the sources in mm  1 and the exciting star of w75  n ( a ) has no detectable high - velocity gas associated with it .",
    "the star , detected in the infrared , is centered within a shell of warm dust emission and an extended hii region ( hashick et al . 1981 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows a color - color diagram using data from the 2mass point source catalog for stars within @xmath124 of mm  1 that were detected at all three bands . the locus of main - sequence stars is represented by the thick , curved line ( bessell & brett 1988 , koornneef 1983 ) while the two diagonal lines show reddening vectors up to @xmath125 of dust ( adopting the @xmath126 extinction law from cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "sources within the reddening vectors have colors consistent with main - sequence stars reddened by foreground dust .",
    "those to the right of the reddening vectors demonstrate excess emission at @xmath127 m , consistent with the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "the infrared colors of the w75  n ( a ) exciting star are consistent with those of a main - sequence star reddened by foreground dust . in comparison , the two bright stars to the south - east and south - west of mm  1 ( irs  2 and irs  3 ) have excess emission at @xmath127 m consistent with the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "the protostars within mm  1 and mm  2 are not detectable at infrared wavelengths .",
    "n represents a region of clustered star formation which appears to be forming mid to early - b stars which exist at a range of developmental stages .",
    "vla  1 ( ba ) appears to have a well - collimated , outflow based on the ionized gas morphology imaged by torrelles et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the presence of a relatively well - collimated , red - shifted co lobe which extends about 0.5  pc north - east of the source .",
    "however , the spectral type of the protostar is unknown since the ionized gas appears to be due to thermal jet emission .",
    "the well - collimated outflow which appears to be produced by the embedded source in mm  2 is not detected at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "either the powering source is not an early - b star ( e.g. it does not have sufficient ionizing radiation to produce a detectable uc hii region ) or accretion onto the protostar is sufficiently high that it prevents the formation of a uc hii region ( see e.g. churchwell 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "there is no evidence for well - collimated flows ( collimation ratios , length / width , @xmath128 ) from the remaining embedded sources ( early - b protostars ) or in the large - scale morphology of the co , , & [ feii ] emission .",
    "the lack of highly - collimated flows from the known , early - b protostars in w75  n suggests that it may be difficult for massive stars to collimate outflowing material . although a few mid to early - b protostars appear to be powering ionized jets , their molecular outflows tend to be complex and poorly collimated ( see , e.g. , the review by shepherd 2002 and references therein ) . to our knowledge , there is no well - collimated _ molecular _ outflow powered by a massive protostar ( spectral type early - b to o ) and most do not appear to have ionized outflow components that are well - collimated ( e.g. ridge & moore 2001 , shepherd , claussen , & kurtz 2001 ; churchwell 1999 ) .",
    "poorly collimated flows could be due to several factors :    * confusion from multiple outflow sources in a cluster ( e.g. w75  n : this work ; or dr  21 : garden et al .",
    "1991 ) ; * large flow precession angles ( e.g. pv ceph : reipurth , bally , & devine 1997 , gomez , kenyon , & whitney 1997 ; or iras 20126@xmath524104 : shepherd et al .",

    "1998 ; or g192.163.82 : shepherd , claussen & kurtz 2001 ) ; and/or * the molecular flow represents only the truncated base of a much larger flow ( e.g. hh  8081 : yamashita et al .",
    "1989 , rodrguez et al . 1994 ; or g192.163.82 : devine et al .",
    "1999 ) .    our observations of w75  n supports the interpretation that massive protostars may not be able to produce well - collimated molecular outflows .",
    "this conclusion does not rule out the possibility that an underlying , neutral jet may still exist as part of the outflow from the massive protostars in w75  n. high - resolution observations in shock tracers such as sio(j=10,v=0 ) or sio(j=21,v=0 ) may be able to determine whether collimated neutral jets are present in w75  n.",
    "w75  n represents an example of clustered , massive star formation . the cluster covers a wide range of evolutionary stages ; from stars with no apparent circumstellar material to deeply embedded",
    "protostars actively powering massive outflows .",
    "the co outflow measures more than 3  pc from end - to - end and is produced by at least four individual sources .",
    "emission extends well - beyond the co boundaries while [ feii ] emission is only located close to the protostellar cluster .",
