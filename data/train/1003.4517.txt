    "<S> we show that the nnn coupling induces phase transitions from the tomonaga - luttinger liquid to gapped phases with either nel or dimer order . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these two types of ordered phases appear alternately as the easy - plane anisotropy is changed towards the isotropic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the antiferromagnetic ( nel ) order in this model is remarkable , as it is strongly unfavored by both the easy - plane ferromagnetic nn coupling and antiferromagnetic nnn coupling in the classical - spin picture . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that emergent trimer degrees of freedom play a crucial role in the formation of the nel order . </S>"
