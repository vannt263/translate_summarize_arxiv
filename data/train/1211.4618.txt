    "given a graph @xmath1 we can associate a collection of matrices @xmath2 , such that each matrix @xmath3 is hermitian and the off - diagonal entries are non - zero if and only if the entry corresponds to an edge of the graph ; the diagonal entries can be either zero or nonzero .",
    "we can then ask questions about matrices in @xmath2 .",
    "one example is the inverse eigenvalue problem , which asks what set of eigenvalues are possible for matrices belonging to @xmath2 .",
    "the complete inverse eigenvalue problem has been solved for very few graphs @xcite .",
    "a relaxation of the inverse eigenvalue problem is to compute the minimum possible rank of matrices in @xmath2 , denoted @xmath4 . since the diagonal has no restrictions this is equivalent to determining the maximum possible multiplicity of an eigenvalue for matrices in @xmath2 , in particular the maximum nullity of a matrix in @xmath2 .",
    "( recall the nullity is the dimension of the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue @xmath5 . )",
    "any matrix in @xmath2 gives a lower bound for the nullity of a matrix associated with the graph , but upper bounds must come from a more general argument .",
    "one method of producing upper bounds for the nullity that has proven successful for small graphs and graphs with some degree of structure is the zero forcing number of a graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the zero forcing number , denoted @xmath6 , is the smallest number of vertices that when colored black will `` force '' all vertices to be colored black using a color change rule which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "a problem lying between the inverse eigenvalue problem and the maximum nullity problem is determining the inertia set of a graph , denoted @xmath7 .",
    "this is the collection of all possible pairs @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of positive eigenvalues and @xmath0 the number of negative eigenvalues for @xmath10 .",
    "given @xmath9 and @xmath0 the multiplicity of zero as an eigenvalue , i.e. , nullity , is @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , an upper bound on the nullity of such a matrix given that it has @xmath0 negative eigenvalues will produce a lower bound for @xmath9 and so constrains the inertia set of a graph .    in this paper we will introduce a new combinatorial game played with two players that bounds the nullity of matrices associated with a graph and which have @xmath0 negative eigenvalues .",
    "this new game is a generalization of previous zero forcing games with an extra parameter @xmath0 which will show up in a new forcing rule involving the second player .",
    "the minimal cost it will take for the black player in the game to color all vertices black will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "we will show how @xmath12 gives an upper bound for the nullity of a matrix @xmath3 with @xmath0 negative eigenvalues .",
    "for the special case @xmath13 the parameter @xmath14 , i.e. , the regular zero forcing number , while for @xmath15 , the parameter @xmath16 , the positive semidefinite zero forcing number ( introduced in @xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : z ] we will give a short review of both zero forcing and positive semidefinite zero forcing , which we will generalize in section  [ sec : zq ] with our new zero forcing parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we then will introduce @xmath17 in section  [ sec : hat ] which will give a further improvement for determining the inertia set of a graph . in section  [ sec : final ] we will show how to use these new parameters to bound the inertia set of a graph . finally , in section  [",
    "sec : algo ] we will give an algorithm for computing @xmath12 .    we will use the following notation in this paper : for a subset of vertices , @xmath18 , let @xmath19 $ ] be the induced subgraph of @xmath1 on the vertices @xmath20 .",
    "zero forcing can be thought of as a game , played on the graph @xmath1 by a single player .",
    "the game consists of two simple operations , coloring a vertex black and a color change rule .",
    "the _ color change rule _ for a graph with vertices painted black and white gives that any black vertex with exactly one white vertex as a neighbor ( and arbitrarily many black vertices ) , the unique adjacent white vertex changes color from white to black .",
    "an application of the color change rule is known as _",
    "forcing_.    the color change rule will play an important role in the analysis of various zero forcing games we will discuss .",
    "the motivation behind the definition comes from looking at vectors in the null space of a matrix .",
    "suppose @xmath21 is in the null space for a matrix @xmath10 , i.e. , we have @xmath22 .",
    "further , when the vertices of the graph are colored black the corresponding entries of @xmath21 are @xmath5 while the vertices colored white are undetermined . the color change rule is the observation that we might also have some additional entries of @xmath21 that must also be @xmath5 .",
    "this is because if vertex @xmath23 is black and its only white neighbor is vertex @xmath24 then , @xmath25 .",
    "but since @xmath26 then we must have @xmath27 , i.e. , the vertex in the graph can also be colored black .",
    "we are now ready to give the zero forcing game .",
    "the minimal number of tokens that black must use in a given strategy to change all of the vertices from white to black is the zero forcing number @xmath6 . because of the non - adaptive nature of the game , black can choose to first only consider the option of using tokens to change vertices from white to black and then apply the second option of using the color change rule . in this setting",
    "the set of vertices that black initially spends his tokens on are known as a _ zero forcing set _ and @xmath6 is then the minimal size of a zero forcing set .",
    "this is the way that zero forcing is usually defined and introduced ( i.e. , as a set rather than a strategy ) .    by the color change rule",
    "it follows that any vector in the null space of @xmath10 which is @xmath5 on a zero forcing set of @xmath1 is the @xmath28 vector . on the other hand , by considering the dimensions of various subspaces we have the following .    [ obs : dim ] if the nullity of a matrix is more than @xmath29 , then for any @xmath29 specified entries there is a nonzero vector @xmath21 in the null space which will vanish at those specified entries",
    ".    we immediately have the following .    [ prop : aim ] for any @xmath10 the dimension of the nullity is bounded above by the size of any zero forcing set , in particular by @xmath6 .",
    "suppose not , then by the above observation there would exist a nonzero vector in the null space which is @xmath5 on all the vertices corresponding to a minimally sized zero forcing set .",
    "but this is impossible since the only vector in the null space which is @xmath5 on a zero forcing set is @xmath28 .",
    "a modification of zero forcing was considered when the matrices in @xmath2 were further restricted to require that the matrices be positive semidefinite .",
    "since this imposes additional relationships on entries in the matrix it is possible to modify the game to give black more power in forcing vertices to be black .",
    "in particular we have the same option to spend tokens and for applying the color change rule on the whole graph .",
    "we also have an option allowing us to apply the color change rule on a _ smaller _ part of the graph  that is , we may be allowed to ignore some of the white neighbors of a black vertex , leaving `` exactly one '' white neighbor under consideration , which can then be forced black .",
    "the minimal number of tokens that black must use to change all of the vertices from white to black in this game is denoted @xmath30 .",
    "as before , black can elect to initially only spend tokens and then apply either of the options using the color change rule for the remainder of the game , and so the literature discusses positive semidefinite forcing sets and not positive semidefinite forcing strategies . in this setting @xmath30",
    "is the size of the smallest possible such set .",
    "[ thm : z+ ] the nullity of @xmath3 when @xmath31 is positive semidefinite is at most @xmath30 .",
    "this is a special case of theorem  [ thm : zq ] and we will omit the proof here .",
    "the original proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "the semidefinite zero forcing number gives an indication of how to generalize zero forcing .",
    "namely , we give black the possibility of working with a smaller graph .",
    "this leads us to the general @xmath32-forcing game .    in this game white",
    "has the goal of making it as costly for black as possible , or in other words , white is trying to delay the process of all the vertices from black .",
    "the minimal number of tokens that black must use to change all of the vertices from white to black , regardless of the play of white , is the zero forcing number for matrices with @xmath0 negative eigenvalues , denoted @xmath12 .",
    "consider the graph shown in figure  [ fig : exa ] on @xmath33 vertices .",
    "a simple case analysis shows that @xmath34 .",
    "( black must always start by spending a token , and if the graph does not have a leaf then in the @xmath35-forcing game black must spend at least two tokens before anything can occur . but by symmetry one can easily show that white can prevent black from forcing more than a single vertex . )    we now show that @xmath36 . in this case",
    "black spends three tokens to color the vertices @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 black , as shown in figure  [ fig : exb ] .",
    "then by forcing on the whole graph the vertices @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 become black , as shown in figure  [ fig : exd ] .",
    "there are now three connected components when the black vertices are removed , black picks any two of them and declares them to white",
    ". whatever white returns can be forced and then using the color change rule on the entire graph will finish changing the remaining white vertices to black .    unlike zero forcing and positive semidefinite zero forcing , the strategy for black may no longer be to spend all the tokens up front .",
    "in other words there are graphs where black will vary the choice of where to spend tokens depending on the response of white .",
    "so we do not have @xmath32-forcing sets but @xmath32-forcing strategies .",
    "consider the graph shown in figure  [ fig : ex2a ] on @xmath43 vertices .",
    "it will follow from corollary  [ cor : zq ] along with the known properties of this graph that @xmath44 .",
    "we will show a strategy for black that uses @xmath38 tokens to make all the vertices of the graph black .",
    "first , black spends two tokens to color the vertices @xmath45 and @xmath46 black . since these are pendant vertices these then force the vertices @xmath37 and @xmath43 to black by using the color change rule on the whole graph .",
    "black now picks a vertex from @xmath47 and a vertex from @xmath48 and declares it to white , whatever is returned is then forced and this continues until one of the two sets has been completely colored black .",
    "in the worst case scenario for black , white will have only returned the vertices from @xmath48 in which case the graph is as shown in figure  [ fig : ex2c ] . at this point",
    "black can spend at most two tokens to get all but one of the remaining vertices to become black and the last vertex will then be switched to black by the color change rule .    if in the previous example black had chosen to initially spend four tokens before using any free forcing , then at least two of @xmath49 or two of @xmath50 would not be black . at this point white can now always block black from coloring the two remaining vertices without spending a token ( i.e. , the color change rule on the whole graph can not color the vertices since they share a common neighbor and white can always keep those two vertices white when black declares some connected components ) .",
    "this also shows that white should not always return all the subsets black has declared even though intuitively it would seem that the more white vertices there are , the more difficult it should be for black to apply the color change rule .",
    "( the important point is that the intuition holds only when the white components are `` close '' . )    for each graph @xmath1 and each value @xmath0 we have a parameter @xmath12 .",
    "these are nicely ordered in the following sense .",
    "[ prop : order ] for any graph we have @xmath51    for @xmath15 , black can select @xmath37 component , and then white has no choice but to return that component , we can thus remove white from the game and reduce to the game for semidefinite zero forcing .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 . black can now use the strategy for the @xmath53-forcing game that uses at most @xmath54 tokens in the @xmath55-forcing game and force all the vertices to be black .",
    "it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "finally , black can choose to color all the vertices of a zero forcing set black , at a cost of @xmath6 tokens and then change all the remaining vertices to black using the color change rule .",
    "this shows that @xmath57 for all @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , the role of white only comes into play if there are at least @xmath58 connected components in @xmath59 $ ] . when the number of connected components is always below @xmath0 then we reduce to the original zero forcing game . in other words",
    ", we can think of the zero forcing number of a graph as @xmath60 .",
    "on the other hand , the parameter @xmath12 can behave differently than the zero forcing and semidefinite zero forcing parameters .",
    "for example , if @xmath61 is the disjoint union of @xmath1 and @xmath62 , then it is easy to show that @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. , since to force the union of graphs we must force each graph individually .",
    "however , we have @xmath65 , and we usually have a strict inequality .",
    "for example , consider @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath68 and @xmath69 . but",
    "using a strategy similar to the one given in the second example we have @xmath70    as before , the parameter @xmath12 gives information about the maximum nullity for some subset of the matrices in @xmath2 .",
    "[ thm : zq ] the nullity of @xmath3 when @xmath31 has exactly @xmath0 negative eigenvalues is at most @xmath12 .",
    "we remark the proof we will give for theorem  [ thm : zq ] also works to show that `` exactly @xmath0 '' can be relaxed to `` at most @xmath0 '' . before we begin the proof we first need to introduce isotropic subspaces .",
    "an _ isotropic subspace _ of a matrix is a subspace where @xmath71 for all @xmath72 in the subspace .",
    "( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.5))[thm : iso ] the maximum possible dimension of an isotropic subspace for a hermitian matrix @xmath31 is @xmath73 where @xmath9 and @xmath0 are the number ( counting multiplicity ) of positive and negative eigenvalues respectively .",
    "[ cor : iso ] for a hermitian matrix @xmath31 , let @xmath74 be an isotropic subspace of dimension more than @xmath75 where @xmath9 and @xmath0 are the number ( counting multiplicity ) of positive and negative eigenvalues respectively . then @xmath74 contains a vector in the null space",
    ".    any of the @xmath76 eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue @xmath5 can be in the isotropic subspace , beyond this , by theorem  [ thm : iso ] there are at most @xmath75 vectors making the isotropic subspace .",
    "the result now follows by dimension arguments .",
    "given a matrix @xmath31 with @xmath0 negative eigenvalues and multiplicity of @xmath77 for the eigenvalue @xmath5 , we will use the matrix to produce a strategy for white in the @xmath32-forcing game .",
    "this strategy can be used to show that starting from @xmath78 that black will have to spend at least @xmath77 times to force all vertices to be black , showing that @xmath79 , as desired .",
    "the strategy will be as follows : after every time black spends a token then white will look at the space @xmath80 which is the intersection of the null space and the span of vectors with nonzero entries only for the white vertices .",
    "let @xmath81 be the support of @xmath80 , i.e. , the vertices for which some vector in @xmath80 is nonzero for that vertex .",
    "then by general position there is some null vector @xmath82 whose support is @xmath83 .",
    "we now show that white can keep black from using the color change rule to switch the color for any vertex in @xmath83 ; or in other words , white can protect the support of @xmath80 .",
    "recall from the discussion following the color change rule in section  [ sec : z ] that the only time a vertex will change from white to black by the rule is if the entry in the null space vector @xmath21 is @xmath5 .",
    "so when applying the color change rule to the entire graph we can not change the color for anything in the support of @xmath21 , i.e. , anything in the support of @xmath83 .",
    "so now consider the option where white is involved .",
    "suppose that @xmath84 are the vertices colored black and @xmath85 are the vertices of the maximally connected components of @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "then by appropriate relabeling we can assume that @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the submatrix on @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "then for any index @xmath23 using that @xmath22 we have @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the vector @xmath21 restricted to @xmath91 ( all the other terms are zeroed out ) .",
    "if @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 this shows the span of the vectors @xmath94 form an isotropic subspace of @xmath31",
    ". black has selected at least @xmath95 of the @xmath96 , and each @xmath96 is associated with @xmath90 .",
    "if any of the @xmath97 for the corresponding components that black gave to white , then white will return that single component to black since then any forcing on that component will not impact the support of @xmath72 , i.e. , the support of @xmath83 .",
    "now suppose none of the @xmath90 are @xmath98 for the components black gives to white .",
    "then by corollary  [ cor : iso ] there is a nontrivial null vector in the subspace spanned by the @xmath90 . in particular",
    ", there is some null vector @xmath99 .",
    "white returns all of the @xmath96 components for which @xmath100 .    by the same argument as above , any application of the color change rule that black is able to apply in this returned set can not impact a nonzero entry of @xmath101 .",
    "but the nonzero entries of @xmath101 are precisely the nonzero entries of @xmath21 restricted to the sets that were returned . so as before black can not change the color for",
    "a vertex corresponding to a nonzero entry of @xmath21 , and so can not force a vertex in @xmath83 .    in both operations of applying the color change rule",
    "we see that black can not change the color of a vertex in @xmath83 . in particular , the only way that black has to reduce the size of @xmath83 is to spend a token .",
    "for each token spent this adds one constraint to the set of null vectors that still have support on the white vertices , i.e. , it reduces the dimension of the new @xmath80 by at most one .",
    "starting with the set of all vertices we have that the dimension of the null space is @xmath77 . every time that black spends the dimension of the null space vectors that are still in the support of the white vertices reduces by at most one , and the process can not stop until this dimension is @xmath5 ( i.e. , the only vector when all vertices are black is @xmath28 ) .",
    "therefore black has to spend a token at least @xmath77 times .",
    "the proof shows that a matrix can give a strategy for white to play that forces black to spend at least the size of the maximum nullity .",
    "however , white does not need to base the strategy off of a matrix and so in general this bound will not be tight .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 works well for small graphs . for example on all but one tree up through @xmath33 vertices we can use @xmath12 to get tight bounds for the nullity of a matrix associated with the tree which has @xmath0 negative eigenvalues .",
    "the one exception is the tree @xmath83 shown in figure  [ fig : bftree ] , sometimes referred to in the literature as the barioli - fallat tree .        for this tree",
    "the maximum nullity for a matrix with @xmath37 negative eigenvalue is @xmath40 ( a method that computes all possible numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues for a matrix associated with a tree is given in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have @xmath102 .",
    "it is easy to see that a strategy for black is to spend tokens on @xmath103 and then force to get @xmath104 ; black then hands white the sets @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; whatever is returned is forced and forcing on the whole graph gives the rest . on the other hand",
    "if black only spends two tokens then simple case analysis will check that one of the pairs @xmath107 , @xmath108 or @xmath109 will both be white . at this point",
    "white can now protect that pair and so black can not get all the vertices to be black with just @xmath40 tokens .",
    "recently an improvement for zero forcing was introduced by barioli et al .",
    "@xcite and is denoted by @xmath110 .",
    "this can be extended to give an improved @xmath17 , which correctly gives the correct bounds for the barioli - fallat tree and improved bounds for many other graphs .",
    "the approach is to introduce auxiliary graphs @xmath111 which is the same as @xmath1 except each vertex is placed into one of two groups : looped ( which can force itself when it is white with all black neighbors ) , and unlooped ( which if incident to a single white vertex can force that vertex even if itself is white ) .",
    "the game is unchanged except for a modified color change rule .",
    "the _ color change rule for a graph with loops and unloops _ and vertices painted black and white gives that any vertex with exactly one white vertex as a neighbor ( and arbitrarily many black vertices ) , the unique adjacent white vertex changes color from white to black .    in particular ,",
    "we have that white vertices are allowed to force with the convention that a vertex with a loop has itself as a neighbor and a vertex with an unloop does not have itself as a neighbor .",
    "we define @xmath112 where the maximum runs over the set of all possible auxiliary graphs @xmath113 .",
    "the idea behind this is that we also give restrictions to the diagonal entries of the matrix in @xmath2 . in other words",
    "we are specifying the zero / nonzero pattern on the diagonal by putting loops at nonzero entries on the diagonal and unloops at zero entries on the diagonal .",
    "we are taking the maximum so that we handle every possible combination of the diagonal .    in theory",
    "this is computationally prohibitive because we have to run over all possible ways to loop / unloop the vertices .",
    "however in practice we only need to find a set of situations which cover all possibilities .",
    "consider again the barioli - fallat tree and let us try to compute @xmath114 .",
    "suppose that there was a loop at @xmath40 .",
    "now consider the following strategy for black .",
    "black spends at @xmath39 and @xmath46 ; forcing then changes @xmath38 and @xmath41 to black ; black now hands white @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; whatever is returned is forced and forcing on the entire graph gets us to only the vertices @xmath40 and @xmath42 as white ; @xmath40 is looped so it now forces itself to black ; forcing then gives @xmath42 . in this case",
    "black is able to color all the vertices black using only two tokens . by symmetry",
    "the same strategy works if there is any loop at a leaf .",
    "now consider a strategy for black when all of the leaves are unlooped . without spending black",
    "has that @xmath104 are black by the unlooped leaves ; black hands white @xmath117 and @xmath106 and whatever is returned is forced , without loss of generality let us suppose that only @xmath117 is returned ; black now hands white @xmath106 and @xmath118 and whatever is returned is forced , without loss of generality let us suppose that only @xmath106 is returned ; black spends on @xmath5 and @xmath46 ; the remaining vertices are then forced .",
    "all possibilities of being looped and unlooped falls into one of these two cases and in each case black only needed to spend at most @xmath40 , showing that @xmath119 ( equality follows from what is known about the possible eigenvalues of @xmath83 ) .    since black",
    "does not have to use the looped and unlooped vertices , i.e. , only lets black vertices force , we have that @xmath120 . so @xmath17 is a better bound .",
    "for example for trees the parameter @xmath17 correctly gives the right nullity for all but one tree up through @xmath121 vertices .",
    "the one exception is a graph on @xmath121 vertices related to the barioli - fallat tree shown in figure  [ fig : bftree16 ] .",
    "this demonstrates that there is still room for improvement in bounding the nullity of matrices associated with a graph .",
    "a primary motivation for the parameters @xmath12 was to provide lower bounds for inertia sets . recall that the inertia set of a graph , @xmath7 , is the set of all possible @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of positive eigenvalues and @xmath0 is the number of negative eigenvalues , for matrices in the set @xmath2 . to give upper bounds",
    "it suffices to produce matrices , lower bounds are more difficult in that we must show that some matrix is not possible .",

    "if and only if @xmath124 . in other words the inertia sets have symmetry across the line @xmath125 .",
    "further , inertia sets do not have `` holes '' .",
    "this is a consequence of the following `` northeast lemma '' , which says that if a point is in the inertia set then everything above and to the right ( up to the dimension constraint ) is also in the set .",
    "[ prop : ne ] if @xmath123 then @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are nonnegative integers and @xmath129 .",

    "if @xmath130 and @xmath131 then @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    the way we will use @xmath12 to help give lower bounds for the inertia is by use of the following observation .",
    "[ cor : zq ] we have @xmath135 .",
    "this follows since @xmath136 where @xmath77 is the nullity of the matrix , since @xmath12 is an upper bound on the nullity we can conclude that @xmath137 .",
    "this shows that if we have @xmath0 negative eigenvalues then we can not have @xmath138 positive eigenvalues , i.e. , the point is not in the inertia set of the graph .",
    "we can now apply the southwest corollary to the following set to give a lower envelope for the points which are not in @xmath7 : @xmath139    as an example let us consider desargues graph on 20 vertices , shown in figure  [ fig : des ] ( with some forcing sets marked ) .",
    "we can use the various parameters we have discussed with differing conditions to find lower bounds for the inertia set of this graph .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : desbnds ] and we summarize them below .",

    "we have now computed lower bounds , the best coming from @xmath150 .",
    "we have not yet determined the inertia set for desargues graph , and it is not completely known .",
    "however it is known that @xmath152 and @xmath153 are in the inertia set . to construct the point @xmath152",
    "we construct a @xmath154 matrix in @xmath2 by puttings @xmath5s on the diagonal and @xmath37 for the edges except for five edges which receive @xmath155 , these five edges are every other spoke between the inner and outer cycles and are marked in figure  [ fig : desmarked ] .    , red edges are @xmath155 to get @xmath152 for the inertia set . ]    the eigenvalues for the resulting matrix are @xmath156 ^ 6,[0]^8,[\\sqrt5]^6 $ ] ( where exponents denote multiplicity ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath152 is in the set by construction .",
    "further if we add @xmath157 then the resulting matrix has eigenvalues",
    "@xmath158 ^ 6,[\\sqrt5]^8,[2\\sqrt5]^6 $ ] showing that @xmath153 is in the set .      for the matrix that we constructed to show that @xmath152 was in the inertia set for desargues graph we had that the diagonal entries were all zero . for desargues graph",
    "it can be shown that the _ only _ matrices that can give @xmath152 must have all zeroes on the diagonal .",
    "this can be shown by looking at @xmath150 .",
    "in particular , if we look over all the possible ways to have the vertices looped and unlooped then we see that @xmath159 achieves the maximum at the unique assignment of unlooped at each vertex , i.e. , any matrix with a nonzero on the diagonal would not have maximum nullity ( assuming that a matrix does achieve this maximum ) .",
    "desargues graph is not the only graph with this property .",
    "others include complete multipartite graphs where each part is of size at least @xmath42 , as well as @xmath160 minus a perfect matching and many others .",
    "when computing the inertia set of a disjoint union of graphs we can compute the inertia of each graph separately and then take the minkowski sum of the inertia sets .",
    "similarly , given the lower bounds for two graphs we can take the minkowski sum of their lower bounds to produce a lower bound for their disjoint union .",
    "for finding the lower bounds of inertia sets by computing @xmath32 of the disjoint union of two or more graphs , it is better to do it for each graph separately and combine the results .",
    "one reason is that this is computationally easier .",
    "another reason is that for some graphs the bounds are worse when we compute @xmath32 together than when we combine the two results . for example consider the graph @xmath161 shown in figure  [ fig : unionbad ] .",
    "vertices with @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 . ]    by taking the minkowski sum of two copies of the lower bounds for this graph we can conclude that for the disjoint union of two copies of @xmath161 that the maximum nullity is at most @xmath38 when considering matrices with @xmath40 negative eigenvalues .",
    "however we have @xmath165 , which is a worse bound .",
    "in general it is possible to show that @xmath166 and the example above shows that we can have a strict inequality .",
    "( note that if the parameter did behave like a minkowski sum we would have an equality in the above relationship . )",
    "several algorithms for computing the zero forcing number of a graph have been implemented in sage .",
    "one brute force method is to simply examine all subsets of the vertices , starting with the singletons , and determine which of these subsets when colored black can force all of the other vertices to black by repeated application of the color change rule .",
    "the smallest such subset is a minimal zero forcing set and its size gives the zero forcing number .    our approach will be a similar brute force approach in that we will look at all sets @xmath167 and determine the minimal number of tokens that black must spend to make all the vertices black given that black is starting with the vertices in @xmath84 already colored black .",
    "the algorithm will make use of the color change rule and we will continually apply the color change rule when we can since this is always free ( this reduces the amount of information that needs to be stored and the number of cases that need to be considered ) .",
    "algorithm  [ alg : force ] gives a simple method to force as much as possible given a subset of vertices of a graph already colored black .",
    "( for a vertex @xmath168 of a graph , @xmath169 is the set of neighbors of @xmath168 . )",
    "the approach for finding @xmath12 will be to calculate the minimal number of tokens needed to guarantee that black can get from a current coloring of vertices to having all vertices colored black under the rules of the game .",
    "in other words , for each @xmath171 we associate a cost to it , denoted @xmath172 , that will indicate the minimal number of tokens black needs to get all vertices colored black given that @xmath173 is already colored black .",
    "so for example when all vertices are already colored black we need @xmath5 tokens and so @xmath174 while when all vertices are colored white then the minimal cost is @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "we work backwards , since we already know @xmath176 , from the large subsets to smaller subsets . at each stage",
    "we consider each of the three options available to black and choose the option which minimizes cost .",
    "the most difficult part of doing this is determining what occurs for the option when white is involved ( lines 5 - 12 of algorithm  [ alg : znum ] ) . in this case",
    "we consider every possible set of subsets to hand to white and we calculate the cost of each one being returned to us , since we are assuming that white will try to block us we take the cost as the most expensive of these options",
    ".        the cost function generated by this algorithm can be used by black to determine a strategy for playing that uses at most @xmath12 tokens .",
    "namely at each stage black chooses an option that will let them win with the number of tokens they have available to them .",
    "also , black will be able to win by spending all the tokens up front if and only if there is some @xmath171 with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .      the ideas for this note grew out of a problem session at the 2010 nsf - cbms conference , `` the mutually beneficial relationship of matrices and graphs '' , held at iowa state university and supported by grant dms0938261 .",
