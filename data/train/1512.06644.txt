    "when multiterawatt laser pulses focused to ultrahigh intensities illuminate the surfaces of dense plasma targets , protons can be accelerated to energies of several tens of mev within acceleration distances of only a few micrometers @xcite .",
    "there are many potential applications for such beams , for example : isotope generation for medical applications @xcite , ion therapy @xcite and proton radiography @xcite .",
    "however , several of the foreseen applications of laser - driven ion sources require high energies per nucleon ( above 100 mev ) and a small energy spread , which is still far beyond the reach of current laser - plasma accelerators .",
    "it is therefore important to find ways to optimize the acceleration process with the aim of producing high - energy , mono - energetic ions .    at present ,",
    "the most studied mechanism for laser - driven ion acceleration is target normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa ) @xcite , which has been used to explain experimental results for laser intensities in the range @xmath0{w / cm}^2 $ ] . in tnsa ,",
    "fast electrons that are accelerated by a laser pulse set up an electrostatic sheath - field that in turn accelerates ions from the rear side of the target .",
    "although the sheath - field is very strong ( of the order of teravolts / meter ) , the spatial extent and duration of the field is short . due to the short acceleration distance and time , it is difficult to reach the high energies that are required for many applications . furthermore , tnsa yields protons with a broad energy spectrum .",
    "in contrast to this , electrostatic shock acceleration has been suggested as a mechanism to obtain proton beams with a narrow energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "experimental results have shown that mono - energetic acceleration of protons can be achieved in near - critical density plasma targets at modest laser intensities @xcite , with the hypothesis that these mono - energetic beams are the result of shock - acceleration .    in hot and moderately overdense plasmas ,",
    "shockwaves are of a collisionless nature .",
    "the laser light pressure compresses the laser - produced plasma and pushes its surface to high speed . in the electrostatic picture ,",
    "ions are reflected by a moving potential barrier and as long as the shock - velocity @xmath1 is constant , the reflected ions obtain twice this velocity .",
    "the number of reflected ions is dependent on the size of the potential barrier and temperature of the ions .",
    "@xcite reported that the reflection of ions influences the shock - wave , yielding a trade - off between a mono - energetic spectrum and the number of accelerated particles .",
    "additionally , fiuza _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that if the sheath - field at the rear side can be controlled , e.g. by keeping it approximately constant in time by creating an exponentially decreasing density gradient at the rear side , then the mono - energeticity of the ion distribution created by reflection at the shock - front can be preserved .",
    "combining collisionless shock acceleration ( csa ) with a strong , quasi - stationary sheath - field may be a way to reach even higher maximum proton energies and optimize the ion spectrum . in this work ,",
    "we use 1d1p eulerian vlasov - maxwell simulations to study the interplay of csa and tnsa .",
    "the objective is to investigate how the efficiency of csa is affected by variations in the laser pulse and target parameters , and finding a way to tailor the density profile of the target for enhanced ion acceleration due to combined csa and tnsa .",
    "it is shown that a layered plasma target with a combination of light and heavy ions leads to a strong quasi - static sheath - field , which induces an enhancement of the energy of shock - wave accelerated ions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the vlasov - maxwell solver veritas ( * v*lasov * e*ule*ri*an * t*ool for * a*cceleration * s*tudies ) , used for modelling laser - based ion acceleration .",
    "section iii presents results of simulations of the interaction of short laser pulses with moderately overdense targets with various density profiles .",
    "section iv describes laser - driven ion acceleration using multi - ion species layered targets .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "collisionless acceleration mechanisms can be modelled by the vlasov - maxwell system of equations .",
    "numerical approaches to solve this system are primarily divided into particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods and methods that discretize the distribution function on a grid , so - called eulerian methods . as pic methods do not require a grid in momentum space , they are efficient at handling the large range of scales associated with relativistic laser - plasma interaction . they are therefore very useful to model high dimensional problems",
    ". however , they introduce statistical noise  making it difficult to resolve the fine structures of the distribution function . on the other hand , solving for the distribution function on a discretized grid yields a high resolution of fine structures , but at a higher computational cost . in cases when the number of accelerated particles is low , as is sometimes the case in collisionless shock acceleration ( e.g.  in the experiment described in ref .  ) , the low - density tail of the particle distribution is difficult to resolve in pic - simulations . furthermore , the shock - dynamics may be affected by the low - density non - thermal component in the ion distribution @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose to implement the eulerian approach in this work .    for the case of a plasma with spatial variation in one direction ,",
    "the vlasov - equation can be reduced to a two dimensional 1d1p problem : @xmath2\\frac{\\partial f } { \\partial p_x}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the electron or ion distribution function , @xmath4 is a spatial coordinate , @xmath5 is a momentum coordinate in this direction , @xmath6 denotes the rest mass of the charged particles ( electrons or ions ) and @xmath7 is the relativistic factor . the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath8^{1/2}+q\\phi$ ] yields conservation relations for the transverse canonical momentum ( orthogonal to the direction of variation of the plasma ) : @xmath9 .",

    "the numerical tool used in this paper , veritas , employs time - splitting  @xcite and the positive and flux conservative  @xcite methods to solve the vlasov - equation self - consistently with maxwell s equations .",
    "veritas has been extensively benchmarked by comparing with results obtained by the pic code picador@xcite and results of another vlasov - maxwell solver @xcite .",
    "furthermore veritas shows excellent agreement with analytical results derived in ref .  , where quasi - stationary solutions were obtained for a cold overdense plasma with a fixed ion background , illuminated with circularly polarized light ( the specifics of these benchmarks will be discussed in future work ) .",

    "the main reason for the later development is the shorter pulse length and higher intensity , which leads to operation close to the onset of relativistic transparency and larger peneteration of the pulse into the plasma rather than reflection / compression at the plasma vacuum interface .",

    "if the ions have acquired a velocity in the direction of the shock , reflection occurs at a slightly smaller barrier height , which is the case at later times due to sheath - expansion of the target .",
    "hence , a shock solution may develop although the potential barrier initially does not have sufficient height for ion reflection to occur .    for a linearly rising potential barrier ,",
    "the reflection time for an ion is given by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the spatial extent of the barrier .",
    "as mentioned before , the potential barrier for the shorter and more intense pulse is initially wider ( see fig .  [ potentials ] ) , yielding a proportionally longer reflection time .",
    "even if the shock - velocity is slightly higher in the more intense case , the spatial extent of the barrier is even larger , so the reflection time , @xmath92 , is longer .",
    "figure  [ peakdens ] shows a steepening of the peak ion density from @xmath94 to @xmath95 in the case of the shorter and more intense pulse ( solid blue line ) .",

    "the width of the potential barrier is reduced and therefore the reflection time for the ions as well .",
    "finally , a shock is developed , albeit much later than in the case of the longer pulse .",

    "vlasov - modelling of collisionless shock - acceleration allows for high resolution of the distribution function , and therefore is highly suitable in cases where effects of low - density tails in the distribution function need to be resolved accurately . in this paper",
    "we have restricted the discussion to 1d1p modelling for simplicity .",
    "although the shock - dynamics is expected to be slightly different in the 2d case , the main conclusions should be valid , given the fact that particle - in - cell simulations have shown only a few percent differences in the energy cutoff of the ions between 1d and 2d configurations @xcite .",
    "we show that by using a target with a smooth ( e.g.  exponentially decreasing ) density profile at the rear side , tnsa can be kept at a low level , making csa the main mechanism of acceleration of particles . on the other hand",
    ", the energy of the shock - wave accelerated ions could potentially be increased by the sheath - field produced at the rear side . provided that the sheath - field has limited variation in time",
    ", mono - energeticity of the ions may be preserved .",
    "early launch of the shock increases the number of ions that are reflected and can be optimized by an appropriate choice of laser - parameters and also potentially the density profile .",
    "we observe that for the same laser fluency , a higher intensity combined with a shorter laser pulse duration leads to a higher shock - velocity , but the mach - number is only slightly increased .",
    "the main difference compared to the lower intensity and longer pulse length case is that the shock develops later",
    ". this may be due that the shorter duration of the laser pulse leads to a less peaked ion - density and hence wider potential barrier , which results in a longer reflection time for the ions .",
    "we show that splitting the laser - pulse can also lead to higher shock - velocities , but without the delay of the shock - formation .",
    "our simulations show that by using a target which consists of light ions on the front side and heavy ions on the rear side , it is possible to combine a strong quasi - static sheath - field with csa .",
    "the dynamics of shock - formation in the double - layer target resembles the one in a rectangular single - species plasma slab , but as soon as the light ions pass the rear side of the target , they obtain higher energies due to a strong sheath field , which is produced due to the charge - separation between the electrons that penetrate the rear side of the target and the heavy ions at rest .",
    "this leads to very efficient acceleration and an increase in the proton energies compared to the energies of shock - reflected ions , without broadening of the energy spectrum if the heavy ion layer has high density .",

    "to evaluate the fluxes @xmath126 , we use the positive and flux conservative method @xcite .",
    "the distribution function @xmath133 , in the cell with index @xmath134 , is approximated in terms of the cell averaged values with indices @xmath135 , @xmath134 and @xmath136 , according to : @xmath137(f_{i+1}-f_{i})\\\\ & + \\frac{\\epsilon_i^-}{6\\delta \\zeta^2 } [ 2(\\zeta-\\zeta_i)(\\zeta-\\zeta_{i+\\frac{3}{2}})\\\\ & + ( \\zeta-\\zeta_{i-\\frac{1}{2}})(\\zeta-\\zeta_{i+\\frac{1}{2}})](f_{i}-f_{i-1}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the time - index @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , the limiters @xmath139 and @xmath140 are given by : @xmath141 and : @xmath142 the quantity @xmath143 is the maximum cell - averaged value .",

    ", we instead have : @xmath147.\\end{array}\\ ] ] this is a third order interpolation of the fluxes , except in the presence of steep gradients .",
    "the limiters ensure that the interpolation is positivity preserving and does not violate the maximum principle .",
    "finally , as boundary conditions , we set the fluxes across boundaries to zero which enforces that particles can not leave or enter the domain and yields strict particle conservation .      by introducing the quantities : @xmath148 we may write : @xmath149 introducing characteristics @xmath150 and @xmath151 , it holds that : @xmath152 as well as : @xmath153    to advance the equations and , we take @xmath154 and use a second order accurate central difference scheme : @xmath155 @xmath156 where @xmath134 is an index for the spatial - coordinate and @xmath138 is an index for the temporal - coordinate .",
    "additionally , the electric field component @xmath157 is calculated by : @xmath158 which is second order accurate , provided that the charge density can be determined with first order accuracy .",
    "regarding boundary conditions , the laser pulse is implemented as a dirichlet boundary condition for the transverse fields and we use open boundary conditions at the boundary that is not associated with the laser .",
    "for the electric field component @xmath157 we have the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath159 at the right boundary .",
    "finally , defining the discretized vector - potential on the spatial cell - faces , it can be calculated with second order accuracy in time on integer time - steps by using a central - difference approximation of the time - derivative in @xmath160 .",
