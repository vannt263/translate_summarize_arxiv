    "the hour of birth to the field with one element was given in jacques tits paper @xcite from 1956 , in which he indicated that the analogy between the symmetric group @xmath3 and the chevalley group @xmath4 ( as observed by robert steinberg in @xcite in 1951 ) should find an explanation by interpreting @xmath3 as a chevalley group over the `` field of characteristic one '' .",
    "though tits idea was not taken serious at that time , it is one of the guiding thoughts in the development of @xmath0-geometry today .",
    "for a recent treatment of steinberg s paper , see @xcite , and for an overview of what geometric objects over @xmath5 should become if @xmath6 , see @xcite .",
    "it took more than 35 years that the field of one element reoccurred in mathematical literature . in an unpublished note ( @xcite ) , mikhail kapranov and alexander smirnov developed the philosophy that the set of the @xmath7-th roots should be interpreted as @xmath8 , a field extension of @xmath0 in analogy to the field extension @xmath9 of @xmath10 . a scheme that contains the @xmath7-th roots of unity",
    "should be thought of as a scheme over @xmath8 .",
    "the tensor product @xmath11 should be the group ring @xmath12 $ ] .    in the early nineties , christoph deninger published his studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , et cetera ) on motives and regularized determinants .",
    "in his paper @xcite , deninger gave a description of conditions on a category of motives that would admit a translation of weil s proof of the riemann hypothesis for function fields of projective curves over finite fields @xmath5 to the hypothetical curve @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , he showed that the following formula would hold : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the regularized determinant , @xmath16 is an endofunctor that comes with the category of motives and @xmath17 are certain proposed cohomology groups .",
    "this description combines with nobushige kurokawa s work on multiple zeta functions ( @xcite ) from 1992 to the hope that there are motives @xmath18 ( _ `` the absolute point '' _ ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( _ `` the absolute tate motive '' _ ) with zeta functions @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "deninger computed that @xmath23 and that @xmath24 .",
    "it was yuri manin who proposed in @xcite the interpretation of @xmath18 as @xmath25 and the interpretation of @xmath20 as the affine line over @xmath0 .",
    "the quest for a proof of the riemann hypothesis was from now on a main motivation to look for a geometry over @xmath0 .",
    "kurokawa continued his work on zeta functions in the spirit of @xmath0-geometry in the collaboration @xcite with hiroyuki ochiai and masato wakayama and in @xcite .    in 2004 , christophe soul proposed a first definition of an algebraic variety over @xmath0 in @xcite , based on the observation that the extension of the base field of a scheme can be characterized by a universal property .",
    "his suggestion for a variety over @xmath0 is an object involving a functor , a complex algebra , a scheme and certain morphisms and natural transformations such that a corresponding universal property is satisfied . shortly after that , many different approaches to @xmath0-geometry arose .",
    "anton deitmar reinterpreted in @xcite the notion of a fan as given by kazuya kato in @xcite as a scheme over @xmath0 .",
    "he calculated zeta functions for his @xmath0-schemes ( @xcite ) and showed that the @xmath0-schemes whose base extension to @xmath26 are complex varieties correspond to toric varieties ( @xcite ) .",
    "bertrand ten and michel vaqui associated to any symmetric monoidal category with certain additional properties a category of geometric objects . in the case of the category of sets together the cartesian product , the geometric objects are locally representable functors on monoids , which are @xmath0-schemes in the sense of ton and vaqui .",
    "florian marty developed theory on zariski open objects ( @xcite ) and smooth morphisms ( @xcite ) in this context .",
    "shai haran ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) proposed using certain categories modeled over finite sets as a replacement for rings , and actually produced a candidate for the compactification @xmath13 of @xmath27 in his framework .",
    "nikolai durov developed in @xcite an extension of classical algebraic geometry within a categorical framework that essentially implied replacing rings by a certain type of monads . as a byproduct of his theory he obtained a definition of @xmath0 and an algebraic geometry attached to it .",
    "see @xcite for a summary .    in 2008 ,",
    "alain connes , katia consani and matilde marcolli showed ( @xcite ) that the bost - connes system defined in @xcite admits a realization as a geometric object in the sense of soul .",
    "the suggestion of soul to consider a variation of the functor in his approach and other ideas , led to connes and consani the variation of soul s approach as presented in @xcite . that paper contains a first contribution to tits idea of chevalley groups over @xmath0 , namely ,",
    "connes and consani define them as varieties over @xmath28 .",
    "soul himself wrote only later a text with his originally suggested modification .",
    "it can be found in this volume ( @xcite ) .",
    "yuri manin proposed in @xcite a notion of analytic geometry over @xmath0 .",
    "the key idea is that one should look for varieties having `` enough cyclotomic points '' , an thought that relates to kazuo habiro s notion ( @xcite ) of the cyclotomic completion of a polynomial ring , which finds the interpretation as the ring of analytic functions on the set of all roots of unity .",
    "matilde marcolli presents in @xcite an alternative model to the bc - system for the noncommutative geometry of the cyclotomic tower . for that purpose",
    ", she uses the multidimensional analogues to the habiro ring defined by manin , and constructs a class of multidimensional bc - endomotives .",
    "marcolli s endomotives turn out to be closely related to @xmath2-rings , in the sense of @xcite .",
    "aiming at unifying the different notions of varieties over @xmath0 ( after soul and connes - consani ) as well as establishing new examples of @xmath0-varieties , the authors of this text introduced in @xcite the notion of torified varieties .",
    "of particular interest were grassmann varieties , which are shown to be torified varieties and to provide candidates of @xmath0-varieties .",
    "however , these candidates fail to satisfy the constraints of soul s and connes - consani @xmath0-geometries . independently of this work , connes and consani introduced in @xcite a new notion of scheme over @xmath0 , which simplified the previous approaches by soul and themselves by merging deitmar s and ton - vaquies viewpoints into it .",
    "we will show in this paper that this notion is closely related to torified varieties .",
    "the second author showed in @xcite that connes - consani s new notion of @xmath0-geometry is indeed suitable to realize tits original ideas on chevalley groups over @xmath29 .",
    "another promising notion of @xmath0-geometry was given recently by james borger in @xcite , who advocates the use of @xmath2-ring structures as the natural descent data from @xmath30 to @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an overview of the new land of geometries over the field with one element .",
    "firstly , we review briefly the different developments and building bricks of @xmath0-geometries .",
    "secondly , we tie up and lay paths and bridges between the different @xmath0-geometries by describing functors between them .",
    "this will finally lead to a commutative diagram of @xmath0-geometries and functors between them that can be considered as a first map of @xmath0-land .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in part",
    "[ bricks ] , we review the different notions of @xmath0-geometries .",
    "we describe a theory in detail where it seems important to gain an insight into its technical nature , but we will refrain from a detailed treatment in favor of a rough impression where technicalities lead too far for a brief account . in these cases , we provide the reader with references to the literature where the missing details can be found .    in the order of the paper ,",
    "the following approaches towards @xmath0-geometries are reviewed : deitmar s @xmath0-schemes ( which we call @xmath31-schemes in the following ) are described in section [ mschemes ] , ton and vaqui s @xmath0-schemes in section [ tvschemes ] , haran s @xmath1-schemes in section [ hschemes ] and durov s generalized schemes in section [ durov ] . in section [ svarietiesandco ] ,",

    "the very central objects of @xmath0-geometries are toric varieties .",
    "as we will see , these can be realized in all considered @xmath0-geometries .",
    "we begin in section [ torictom ] with recalling the definition of a toric variety and following kato ( @xcite ) to show that toric varieties are @xmath0-schemes after deitmar , i.e.  @xmath31-schemes . in section [ mtotv ] we describe florian marty s work on comparing deitmar s and ton - vaqui s notions of @xmath0-schemes .    in section [ mtocc ]",

    "the main idea of the proof is to consider for each irreducible component of @xmath69 the unique open torus @xmath393 in the torification of @xmath69 that is contained in the irreducible component ( cf .",

    "namely , the notions of gluing affine pieces are different and it is not clear how to define the grading for an cc - variety . regarding the other direction , going from the complex scheme @xmath400 to the algebra of global functions is a loss of information if the cc - variety is not affine .",
