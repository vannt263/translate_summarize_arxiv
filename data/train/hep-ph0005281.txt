    "the parity - violating ( pv ) nucleon - nucleon interaction has been a subject of interest in nuclear and particle physics for some time . to date",
    ", pv observables generated by this interaction remain the only experimental windows on the @xmath11 , nonleptonic weak interaction . since the 1970 s",
    ", the pv nn interaction has been studied in a variety of processes , including @xmath12 and @xmath13nucleus scattering , @xmath14-decays of light nuclei , the scattering of epithermal neutrons from heavy nuclei , and atomic pv ( for a review , see refs .",
    "the on - going interest in the subject has spawned new pv experiments in few - body systems , including high - energy @xmath12 scattering at cosy , @xmath15 at lansce@xcite , @xmath16 at jlab@xcite , and the rotation of polarized neutrons in helium at nist .",
    "the theoretical analysis of these pv observables is complicated by the short range of the low - energy weak interaction .",
    "the compton wavelength of the weak gauge bosons ( @xmath17 fm ) implies that direct @xmath18 and @xmath19 exchange between nucleons is highly suppressed by the short - range repulsive core of the strong nn interaction . in the conventional framework ,",
    "longer range pv effects arise from the exchange of light mesons between nucleons .",

    "these exchanges are parameterized by pv meson - nucleon couplings , @xmath24 , whose values may be extracted from experiment . at present , there appear to be discrepancies between the values extracted from different experiments .",

    "the origin of this discrepancy is not understood .",
    "one possibility is that the use of @xmath21 and @xmath22 exchange to describe the short - range part of the pv nn interaction is inadequate .",
    "an alternate approach , using effective field theory ( eft ) , involves an expansion of the short - range pv nn interaction in a series of four - nucleon contact interactions whose coefficients are _ a priori _ unknown but in principle could be determined from experiment .",
    "the use of @xmath21 and @xmath22 exchange amounts to adoption of a model  rather than the use of experiment  to determine the coefficients of the higher - derivative operators in this expansion .",
    "whether or not the application of eft to nuclear pv can yield a more self - consistent set of pv low - energy constants than the meson - exchange approach remains to be seen .",

    "similarly , one would expect contributions from the @xmath209 pairs in the sea . since relativistic quark models already contain @xmath209 pairs in the form of z - graphs `` @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that disconnected @xmath209 insertions ( see fig .",

    "the long - distance part of the disconnected @xmath209 insertions appear explicitly in the guise of pseudoscalar loops , while the short - distance contributions are subsumed into the value of @xmath182 and possible higher dimension operators .",
    "quenched '' quark models without explicit pionic degress of freedom generally do not include the long - distance physics of disconnected insertions .",
    "the @xmath210-dependence is different*. in conventional hbchpt analyses of hadronic observables , one only retains the loop contributions non - analytic in the light quark mass .",
    "the constituent quark model ( without explicit pions ) has a difficult time producing these non - analytic contributions .",
    "the simplest , illustrative example is the nucleon isovector charge radius , @xmath211 , which is singular in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "this chiral singularity , of the form @xmath212 , is produced by @xmath20 loops .",
    "relativistic quark models , such as the mit bag model , yield a finite value for @xmath211 as @xmath213 .",
    "one can not produce the chiral singularity in a quark model without including disconnected @xmath209 insertions dressed as mesons .",
    "the corresponding argument in the case of @xmath37 is less direct , but still straightforward . in the limit of a degenerate @xmath70 and @xmath61 , the non - analytic terms in @xmath37 have quark mass - dependences of the form @xmath214 or @xmath128 .",
    "as we show in appendix c , bag model matrix elements of the four quark operators appearing in @xmath31 have a taylor series expansion about @xmath215 .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath206 and @xmath189 can not contain the non - analytic structures generated by the diagrams in figs . 1 - 2 .",

    ", the @xmath216 intermediate state could contain an @xmath217 pair .",
    "as argued previously , however , the z - graphs implicit in the mit bag model calculation of @xmath5 do not produce the nonanalytic structure of the corresponding @xmath20 loop .",
    "apparently , only an unquenched quark model , which generates the disconnected insertions of fig .",
    "5b , could produce the requisite nonanalytic terms .    from this case study `` of the ddh / fcdh calculation of @xmath5 , we conclude that the su(6)@xmath35/quark model approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite does not incorporate the chiral structure of @xmath37 . were the numerical impact of the chiral corrections negligible",
    ", this observation would not be bothersome .",
    "the actual impact of the chiral corrections , however , is significant .",
    "thus , it is perhaps not surprising that the @xmath29f result and the ddh / fcdh best value '' do not agree .",
    "with the confirmation of the electroweak sector of the standard model at the 1% level or better in a variety of leptonic and semi - leptonic processes , one has little reason to doubt its validity in the purely hadronic domain .",
    "similarly , the predictions of qcd in the perturbative regime have been confirmed with a high degree of confidence .",
    "thus , one may justifiably consider @xmath31 , the effective hamiltonian including its perturbative strong interaction correction , to be well understood .",
    "moreover , the precision available with present and future hadronic pv experiments is unlikely to match the levels achieved in leptonic and semileptonic processes .",
    "consequently , one has little hope of detecting small deviations in @xmath31 from its sm structure due to new physics \" . on the other hand ,",
    "much about qcd in the non - perturbative regime remains mysterious : the mechanism of confinement , the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking , the role or sea quarks in the low - energy structure of the nucleon , and so forth .",
    "each of these issues bears on one s understanding of _ matrix elements _ of @xmath31 . in this sense",
    ", the low - energy , pv hadronic weak interaction constitutes a probe of the dynamics of low - energy qcd , in a manner analogous to the probe provided by the electromagnetic interaction .    from a phenomenological standpoint , the matrix element",
    "one may hope to extract from hadronic pv observables with the least ambiguity is @xmath52 . in this study , we have argued that any theoretical interpretation of this matrix element must take into account the consequences of chiral symmetry .",
    "indeed the chiral corrections to the tree - level , pv @xmath25 yukawa coupling are not small . at @xmath54 , the effective coupling measured in experiments , @xmath37 ,",
    "depends not only on the bare coupling , @xmath39 , but also on new ( and experimentally undetermined ) pv low - energy constants , @xmath97 , @xmath135 , and @xmath151 , as well .",
    "furthermore , the coefficients of @xmath39 , @xmath97 , and @xmath151 are comparable in magnitude . at present",
    ", one has only simple theoretical estimates of the magnitudes of the @xmath97 and @xmath135 in addition to the fcdh calculation of @xmath151 .",
    "these estimates suggest that the new pv couplings appearing in @xmath37 could be as large as @xmath39 .",
    "since no experimental constraints have been obtained for the new couplings , there exists considerable latitude in the theoretical expectation for @xmath37 .    for two decades",
    "now , the benchmark theoretical calculation of @xmath52 has been the su(6)@xmath35/quark model approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , updated in ref .",
    "we have argued , however , that the ddh / fcdh calculation does not manifest the general strictures of chiral invariance obtained in the present analysis . at the quark level , this chiral structure reflects the importance of the disconnected `` @xmath209 components of the sea .",
    "while relativistic quark models contain @xmath209 sea quark effects in the guise of z - graphs or lower - component wavefunctions , the most common quenched '' versions do not include explicit disconnected pairs pairs may , however , hide in the effective parameters of the quark model , such as the string tension @xcite . ] .",
    "given the size of the chiral corrections associated in part with the disconnected insertions , it may then be not so surprising to find a possible discrepancy between the experimental value for @xmath37 and the ddh / fcdh best value \" .",
    "applying chiral corrections to the su(3 ) analysis of @xmath154 hyperon decays may help to close the gap between @xmath37 and @xmath207 .",
    "presumably , similar corrections should be applied in other approaches not containing explicit pionic degress of freedom . in the longer run",
