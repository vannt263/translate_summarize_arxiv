    "a non - perturbative definition of asymptotically free gauge theories can , in principle , provide us with a microscopic mechanism for the quark confinement .",
    "the lattice qcd indeed exhibits a linear potential between static quarks by computer simulations .",
    "the linear potential can be interpreted as the existence of the squeezed color flux , _ i.e. , _ the confining string .    the electric - magnetic duality in non - abelian gauge theories is another approach to the quark confinement . in the abelian higgs model , a string appears as a topologically stable configuration  @xcite , which is a magnetic flux tube .",
    "if , on the other hand , one finds the higgs mechanism in the magnetic picture , by duality , the string configuration can be identified as the confining string which is a tube of a color - electric flux  @xcite .",
    "the electric - magnetic dualities in non - abelian gauge theories  @xcite are found to exist in various supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite which can be obtained as the low energy effective theories of the branes in string / m theory  @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , there is a hope that the string / m theory provides a non - perturbative definition of qcd , and the dualities equipped in the theory can explain the quark confinement .",
    "indeed , it has been observed that equations to describe five - brane configurations in m theory can be identified as the seiberg - witten curves of corresponding gauge theories on the world volume , providing us with quantum - level solutions of the gauge theories out of the classical theories of branes  @xcite .",
    "the seiberg - witten curves know exactly where in the moduli space massless magnetic degrees of freedom appear .",
    "the condensation of such magnetic degrees of freedom is interpreted as the confinement .    in the real qcd",
    ", however , it seems that there is no truly weakly coupled description of the confinement - scale physics . in order to understand the confinement as the higgs mechanism in the magnetic picture , we need a deformation of the theory so that the magnetic gauge theory gets weakly coupled and decoupled from the rest of the massive modes .",
    "once the deformation is done smoothly one can study physics there and then go back to the strongly coupled regime without changing the overall picture .    along this line , @xmath6 supersymmetric qcd with soft supersymmetry breaking terms has been studied  @xcite .",
    "the electric - magnetic dualities in @xmath6 theories known as the seiberg duality exist for theories with @xmath12 , although that is out of the region of the real qcd .",
    "it has been observed , in the region where the seiberg duality exists , the addition of the soft terms triggers the spontaneous breaking of the vectorial symmetry such as the baryon number symmetry  @xcite . since the general theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite states that such symmetry breaking can not occur in non - supersymmetric qcd , it has been concluded that there is a phase transition as the soft breaking terms get larger , and thus a simple supersymmetric deformation of qcd did not provide a qualitative understanding of confinement .    in another approach , shifman and yung have studied @xmath5 supersymmetric @xmath13 qcd with @xmath14 flavors ( @xmath15 ) , by using the exact results from the seiberg - witten curve  @xcite . upon turning on the fi - term for the @xmath16 factor , they discussed the crossover transition from the microscopic picture to a dual magnetic picture along the change of the fi parameter @xmath17 . in a strong coupling vacuum for @xmath18 ,",
    "a weakly - coupled dual theory emerges as @xmath19 gauge theory with @xmath14 flavors .",
    "the condensation of massless non - abelian monopoles ( or dyons ) due to the fi - term causes the color - flavor locking and produces the non - abelian vortex  @xcite in the dual magnetic theory , which is identified to be the confining string in the microscopic theory  @xcite .",
    "the approach looks promising for understanding the nature of the seiberg duality .",
    "recently , a new supersymmetric deformation is proposed to possibly connect the supersymmetric qcd and the non - supersymmetric one for @xmath20 which is more relevant to the real world qcd  @xcite .",
    "the deformation is to add @xmath21 numbers of massive flavors to the theory so that the dual magnetic gauge group is @xmath7 .",
    "the flavor symmetry associated with the massive extra flavors , @xmath22 , are gauged in order not to enhance the global symmetry of the theory .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking terms trigger the chiral symmetry breaking @xmath23 by the condensation of the dual squarks while preserving the baryon number symmetry .",
    "the same condensation breaks the dual gauge group @xmath7 completely , and the locks the magnetic color quantum numbers to the unbroken @xmath24 ones , so that the magnetic gauge boson can be identified as the vector mesons .",
    "the structure of the model is the same as the hidden local symmetry  @xcite which is known to be a phenomenologically successful model to describe the @xmath25 meson as a gauge boson of a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry .",
    "the similarity to the real qcd can be the sign of the smooth connection .",
    "see also  @xcite for recent works on the interpretation of the @xmath25 meson as the gauge boson in the seiberg dual theory .    in the model with the extra @xmath21 flavors with the gauged @xmath22 symmetry , one can observe the formation of the string associated with the higgsing of the dual squarks as it breaks the @xmath16 part of the gauged @xmath22 symmetry .",
    "however , it is not clear if this string is something to do with the confining string as it originates from the artificially added @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "it is also not clear what happens to the unbroken @xmath26 subgroup which is again artificially added .    in this paper , in order to clarify these issues , we study an @xmath27 supersymmetric extension of the model , _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath28 gauge theory where @xmath2 flavors of quarks are charged under the @xmath29 gauge group .",
    "there is a link field @xmath30 which transforms as the bi - fundamental representation under @xmath31 . instead of adding a mass term to @xmath30 as it was done in the previous study",
    ", we consider a higgs phase @xmath32 where the theory classically reduces to @xmath4 @xmath2 flavor theory .",
    "the corresponding brane configuration can be constructed in type iia superstring theory , from which one can obtain the seiberg - witten curve by lifting it to m theory .",
    "one can identify the root of the higgs branch of @xmath30 in the coulomb branch of the moduli space , from which the theory is continuously connected to the large @xmath33 region . in the space of the root",
    ", there are points where massless monopoles appear .",
    "such points survive as the vacuum after a perturbation to @xmath34 theory , and the condensation of the monopoles by the perturbation describes the quark confinement . in order to further connect to non - supersymmetric qcd , one should study points where the massless monopoles are flavor singlets since the vector - like flavor symmetry can not be broken in the non - supersymmetric qcd .",
    "we identify these points by using the curve , and study the low energy effective theory at the points .    in a parameter region where one of the two dynamical scales is much larger than the other , one can observe the color - flavor locking in the magnetic picture .",
    "a non - abelian magnetic gauge group , @xmath35 , remains at low energy and higgses later by the condensation of the dual squarks .",
    "since the @xmath16 factor appears as the magnetic gauge group , we see that the color - flavor locking simultaneously describes the quark confinement . by the magnetic color - flavor locking ,",
    "the massive magnetic gauge bosons of @xmath35 become vector mesons with flavor quantum numbers .",
    "these are naturally identified as the @xmath25 and @xmath36 mesons in qcd .",
    "it is interesting that in this picture a string configuration made of @xmath25 and @xmath36 mesons can be interpreted as the confining string  @xcite .    in string theory ,",
    "the introduction of the extra @xmath22 factor and the link field @xmath30 is somewhat a natural deformation . in the type iia construction",
    ", the deformation corresponds to introducing an ns5 brane which is detached from other branes where gluons and quarks live in .",
    "as the ns5 brane moves around , its location sets different values of @xmath30 as well as the relative size of two gauge couplings ( and thus the dynamical scales ) , providing us with a smooth deformation of qcd .",
    "the extra @xmath22 can also be considered as the first kaluza - klein mode in the sense of the dimensional deconstruction  @xcite .",
    "since the type iia construction by d4 branes corresponds to a five dimensional gauge theory in an interval , there are such fields by construction . in this sense",
    ", the extra gauge factor may be a part of the definition of qcd .",
    "and @xmath37 .,width=283,height=207 ]    .quantum numbers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to note that the @xmath38 factor is dynamical , _",
    "i.e. , _ the gauge coupling constant is finite . by the condensation of @xmath39 s , @xmath40",
    "is broken down to a subgroup @xmath38 , and the gauge coupling constant for the @xmath38 gauge boson is @xmath41 the limit @xmath42 provides finite @xmath43 .    in the effective theory ,",
    "there are the following terms in the superpotential : @xmath44 where the latter term is reduced from eq .  .",
    "the vacuum is , therefore , at @xmath45 and there the magnetic gauge group , @xmath46 , is locked to the @xmath7 flavor symmetry while @xmath38 is spontaneously broken .",
    "this symmetry breaking exhibits a string as a finite energy configuration .",
    "the string , however , should not be completely stable since the original theory , the @xmath47 gauge theory , does not support a topologically stable string .",
    "there is a @xmath48 factor which can support a string , but the configuration costs infinite energy because the gauge boson is infinitely heavy .",
    "therefore , the string we find in the effective theory should be broken by a pair creation of quarks which source the magnetic flux of @xmath38 .",
    "the string corresponds to the non - abelian vortex with non - abelian moduli originated from the color - flavor locked symmetry @xmath49 . from the matching argument of the vortex and the monopoles attached to the endpoints  @xcite",
    ", the magnetic sources in our case should transform non - trivially under the flavor symmetry @xmath49 . from this viewpoint , the endpoints of our string can be identified as original quarks , @xmath50 ( or the composites of @xmath50 and @xmath30 ) . in other words ,",
    "the quarks , @xmath50 , are confined by this string .",
    "the lightest hadron in this regime is the massive gauge multiplets of @xmath51 . due to the color - flavor locking ,",
    "the massive gauge fields have flavor quantum numbers , adjoint and singlet , under the @xmath7 flavor symmetry .",
    "they correspond to the vector mesons , @xmath25 and @xmath36 , in qcd .",
    "it is interesting that the higgs mechanism for the vector mesons is the dual picture of the quark confinement .",
    "the quiver model we considered serves as an example of the confinement through the magnetic color - flavor locking . since the vacuum we studied preserves vectorial symmetries , @xmath52",
    ", one may be able to smoothly connect to the non - supersymmetric qcd .",
    "as one sends the mass parameter @xmath53 to infinity , the model reduces to an @xmath6 model which has an enhanced chiral symmetry , @xmath54 .",
    "the condensations in eq .   then describes the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , @xmath55 , which provides the massless pions .",
    "this would be a unification of the chiral symmetry breaking and the confinement if the qualitative picture remains the same as the case with small @xmath53 . in order to connect to real qcd",
    ", we need to add masses to superparticles and also take large @xmath17 to reduces the original gauge group @xmath56 to single @xmath26 . again",
    ", although one can not take this limit while preserving the weak coupling of the magnetic picture , qualitative picture may remain the same .",
    "indeed , it has been known that the picture of @xmath25 and @xmath36 meson as the gauge bosons , and the pions as the uneaten nambu - goldstone bosons in the higgs mechanism for @xmath25 and @xmath36 mesons ( known as the hidden local symmetry  @xcite ) is phenomenologically quite successful .",
    "the model studied above provides a possible theoretical reason why it is successful ; the hidden gauge symmetry is actually identified as the magnetic gauge symmetry at least in a parameter region of a quiver and supersymmetric deformation of qcd . as an experiment , it has been constructed a linear sigma model to describe the higgs mechanism for the @xmath25 and @xmath36 mesons in ref .",
    "the string configuration is constructed as a solution of the classical field equations .",
    "the string tension and the coulomb force between monopoles are estimated by using masses and coupling constants of hadrons as input parameters , and they are found to be consistent with those of the qcd string .",
    "the quark confinement is one of the mysterious phenomena in four dimensional gauge theories . in the real world , the confining string can actually be seen as the linear potential between quarks which can be inferred , for example , from the spectra of quarkonium masses .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review . )",
    "therefore , it sounds promising that the qcd has a magnetic picture whose higgs mechanism supports a string as a ( meta-)stable configuration .",
    "if there is such a picture for the confining string , there should be a massive magnetic gauge boson in the spectrum . here",
    ", an interesting possibility emerges ; the higgsing of the magnetic gauge group actually be of the color - flavor locking type so that the lightest vector mesons , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , are identified as the magnetic gauge bosons . in this picture , the vortex configuration of the @xmath25 and @xmath36 mesons is the confining string , _",
    "i.e. _ , the flux tube of the gluon field .",
    "we have studied the quiver model obtained from type iia superstring theory , that can possibly connect to the real qcd smoothly .",
    "we have indeed observed the color - flavor locking in the magnetic picture in some parameter regions .",
    "if the qualitative picture remains in the limit where non - supersymmetric qcd is realized , the hidden local symmetry is understood as the magnetic picture of qcd and simultaneously describes the confinement .",
    "the model we studied can be thought of as the low energy theory of a five - dimensional qcd _  la _ dimensional deconstruction . for @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", the higgsing @xmath61 happens in the weakly coupled regime , corresponding to the picture of a large extra dimension where the massive gauge boson corresponds to the kaluza - klein mode . as the size of the extra dimension gets smaller ,",
    "the non - perturbative effects become important , and for @xmath62 and @xmath63 we have seen a smooth transition to a picture of the color - flavor locking in the magnetic picture .",
    "the extra - dimensional gauge theory provides a natural deformation of the four - dimensional theory with the size of the extra - dimension as the parameter to smoothly connect the weakly and strongly coupled physics .",
    "such a deformation is natural in the sense of the theory of m5 brane as the fundamental theory  @xcite .",
