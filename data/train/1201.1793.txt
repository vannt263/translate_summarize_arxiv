    "first principles calculations of the free induction decay ( fid ) measured by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) in solids is a long - standing theoretical problem@xcite still lacking a controllable solution@xcite .",
    "the most challenging aspect of this problem is the prediction of the long - time behavior of the fids .",
    "recently some progress in this direction was made on the basis of the notion of microscopic chaos@xcite .",
    "namely , it was predicted that the generic long - time behavior of fids in single crystals has the character of exponential decay with or without sinusoidal oscillations . in the most common case of magnetic dipolar interaction between nuclear spins , the oscillatory regime",
    "is realized , and hence , the long - time fid behavior can be parameterized as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are some constants whose values were not predicted .",
    "it was only estimated@xcite that , generically , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 fall on the timescale of the spin - spin interactions often referred to as @xmath8 .",
    "it was also estimated that the long - time behavior ( [ ltform ] ) becomes dominant after a time on the order of several times @xmath8 from the beginning of the fid .",
    "the above predictions agree with the experimental@xcite and numerical@xcite results for quantum and classical spin systems .",
    "the situation becomes somewhat more involved theoretically for polycrystalline samples or crystal powders .",
    "different orientations of single crystallites in polycrystals / powders with respect to an external magnetic field imply different microscopic hamiltonians , and hence different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which in turn leads to the additional averaging over the oscillation frequencies . at sufficiently long times",
    ", the crystallites exhibiting the smallest value of @xmath5 should start dominating the overall response , and , therefore , the well - defined frequency of these crystallites should also control the overall decay .",
    "we call the latter regime the asymptotic long - time behavior .",
    "it is to be distinguished from the intermediate behavior , which we define as the regime , when the individual crystallites have reached their respective long - time regimes but the asymptotic polycrystalline long - time behavior is not yet reached .",
    "the challenge here is to understand how long the above transition to the asymptotic behavior takes , and what the intermediate behavior looks like .",
    "it is , in particular , possible that the intermediate behavior exhibits a tentative `` washing out '' of the fid beats .    on the experimental side , the available facts about the long - time fid behavior in polycrystals / powders",
    "do not reveal a consistent picture .",
    "on the one hand , no well - defined long - time beats of form have been observed in the caf@xmath2 powder ( within the range limited by the experimental signal - to - noise ratio)@xcite . on the other hand , in hyperpolarized solid xenon ,",
    "which is supposedly polycrystalline , the experiments reveal well - defined beats of form ( [ ltform ] ) appearing rather quickly@xcite .    in the latter case , the situation is complicated by the fact that hyperpolarized solid xenon is prepared in convection cells@xcite by first optically polarizing xenon gas@xcite and then rapidly cooling it into a liquid phase and subsequently quenching the liquid into the solid phase . as a result",
    ", an uncertainty remains about the proper thermalization of the resulting solid .",
    "in addition , the formation of crystal structure in solid xenon is controlled by the relatively weak van der waals interaction , which is known to allow significant residual atomic motion@xcite that further complicates the theoretical analysis .",
    "a related unclear issue is the strength of the exchange coupling between xenon nuclei .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that hyperpolarized solid xenon samples investigated in refs.@xcite can be described as polycrystalline fcc lattices of immobile nuclear spins coupled by magnetic dipole interaction .",
    "we perform the first principles calculations of @xmath0xe fid on the basis of the approximation procedure introduced in refs.@xcite .",
    "we also perform the first principles @xmath1f fid calculation for the powder of caf@xmath2 , where @xmath1f nuclei form a simple cubic lattice .",
    "our goal is to verify whether the above calculations are sufficient to explain why the well - defined beats of form ( [ ltform ] ) were seen in polycrystalline solid xenon@xcite but not in caf@xmath2 powder@xcite .",
    "we will use the approximation scheme for fid calculations that was introduced in ref.@xcite with small modifications added in ref.@xcite .",
    "this scheme is quite similar to the one introduced earlier in ref.@xcite .",
    "alternative attempts to calculate powder fids were made in refs.@xcite .",
    "the approximation technique of ref .",
    "@xcite results in a very accurate description of the extended initial behavior of single crystal fids in caf@xmath2 .",
    "it also leads to the long - time behavior of form , but with constants noticeably different from those observed experimentally ( see below ) . as explained in ref.@xcite , an accurate prediction of the parameters in eq.([ltform ] ) is not expected here due to the oversimplified nature of the approximation .",
    "we are , however , mainly interested in the qualitative question of the difference the solid xenon and the caf@xmath2 powders posed at the end of the preceding section . answering this question presumably depends on the qualitative differences in the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for different orientations of single crystallites in the external magnetic field .",
    "the approximations used should , therefore , be adequate for detecting such differences , if they exist .    in caf@xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath1f nuclei are characterized by spin 1/2 , gyromagnetic ratio @xmath9 and abundance @xmath10 .",
    "these nuclei form simple cubic lattice with period @xmath11 ( at 293  k ) . for solid xenon",
    ", we perform the calculation for the fcc lattice with the nearest neighbor distance @xmath12 and abundance @xmath13 of @xmath0xe nuclei .",
    "this abundance is representative of the sample most studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "other nuclear isotopes present in this xenon sample are assumed to be non - magnetic .",

    "we obtain the powder fid as the average over large number of single crystallite fids .",
    "the orientation of each crystallite in the external magnetic field is selected randomly .    for each crystallite",

    "in order to illustrate the performance of the above approximation scheme , we show in fig .  [ fig - caf2-cryst ] the results of the calculations of the initial and the long - time behavior of single crystal fids in caf@xmath2 for three directions of the external magnetic field . while the linear plots ( insets ) in each panel of fig .

    "for the caf@xmath2 powder , the discrepancies appear starting from the intermediate section of the fid .",
    "we believe that these discrepancies are due to the limitations of the theoretical approximation scheme based on eq.([fint ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the discrepancy for the solid xenon appears from the very beginning of the fid .",
    "it is related to the fact that the theoretical and the experimental values of the second moment @xmath45 are different from each other ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively ) .",
    "since the theoretical value of @xmath45 is the input rather than the output parameter for the theoretical approximation scheme , the above discrepancy indicates the inadequacy of our initial assumptions about either the form or the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "it may be related to the insufficient thermalisation and/or atomic motions in the quenched solid xenon samples@xcite . leaving this discrepancy to be investigated in a later experimental work , below we focus on the outcome of the theoretical calculation and examine the differences between the long - time fid behavior for caf@xmath2 powder and polycrystalline solid xenon .",

    "the intermediate behavior of the solid xenon fid is well described by eq . , which covers about 6 beats and 5 orders of magnitude , while the asymptotic long - time behavior emerges only at relatively late times and small values of fid .",
    "it is expected that the behavior of the middle section of the fids is controlled by the typical single crystallite values of @xmath5 , while the true long - time behavior is controlled by the crystallites with the smallest value of @xmath5 . in order to clarify this issue further , we present in figs .",

    "the long - time parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the simple cubic lattice are much broader and increase or decrease roughly proportionally to each other .",
    "therefore , the typical values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sufficiently different from those representing the asymptotic decay .",
    "the poor performance of the middle section fit is in large part due to the larger difference of frequency @xmath6 between a typical value and the asymptotic long - time value .    on the contrary , all possible values of @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 are more clustered for the fcc polycrystal and do not exhibit much of a systematic dependence on each other . as a result ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath5 is rather close to the true long - time value .",
    "this explains why the fit   to the intermediate fid behavior works so well over an extended time interval .",
    "the more clustered behavior of parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the fcc powder was , in fact , expected .",
    "the differences in @xmath5 and @xmath6 originate from the differences in the truncated hamiltonians for different orientations of the magnetic field with respect to single crystallites .",
    "the orientation - dependent differences are expected to be smaller for the fcc lattice , because the fcc lattice is in a sense more isotropic : each lattice site has 12 nearest neighbors as opposed to 6 nearest neighbors in the case of simple cubic lattice .",
    "the 12-neighbor environment is obviously more isotropic than 6-neighbor environment .",
    "the higher sensitivity of the simple cubic lattice to different orientations of the magnetic field can be illustrated by the example of the magnetic field oriented along [ 111 ] crystal direction , in which case the coupling constants   to all six nearest neighbors become equal to zero  the so called `` magic angle '' condition .    in principle , the polycrystal / powder average also depends on the distribution of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath7 in eq.([ltform ] ) , but we found that the parameter @xmath4 has comparable values for all orientations and that its distribution does not add any new qualitative insight to the above discussion .",
    "likewise , we were not able to find any particularly important aspect associated with the distribution of @xmath7 , apart from the observation that it makes the frequency @xmath6 of the intermediate section fit for caf@xmath2 powder smaller than the minimal value of @xmath6 for individual single crystallites .",
    "we have presented first principles fid calculations for the powder of caf@xmath2 and for polycrystalline solid xenon .",
    "the long - time fid decay for powders / polycrystals is the superposition of the long time decays for individual single crystallites .",
    "the typical single crystallite values of the long - time parameter @xmath5 control the middle section of the resulting fids , whereas the true long - time behavior is controlled by single crystallites with the smallest value of @xmath5 .",
    "we have found that the single crystallite parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are rather broadly distributed caf@xmath2 , and as a result , the intermediate section beats become washed out and relatively quickly evolve to the asymptotic long - time behavior . such a behavior might be observable in the future caf@xmath2 powder experiments with improved signal - to - noise ratio . on the contrary , in the case of solid xenon , the single crystallite values are more clustered , and as a result the middle section is characterized by well defined beat frequency and exponential decay constant over several orders of magnitude , while the true long - time behavior appears only at relatively later times .",
    "we explain the above clustering of parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 by the more isotropic character of the fcc lattice in comparison with the simple cubic lattice .",
    "our findings suggests that the experiments conducted so far in solid xenon have been able to access only the intermediate section of the powder / polycrystalline fids , and hence observed the well - defined behavior  ( [ ltform ] ) .",
    "it is clear that , although observing well - defined behavior ( [ ltform ] ) in the intermediate fid section requires suitable crystal structures , such a behavior would be extremely unlikely , if the long - time behavior of single crystallites were different from ( [ ltform ] ) . therefore , the experiments accessing the intermediate section of fids in polycrystalline fcc solids are appropriate to test the theoretical long - time predictions@xcite originally made mostly for single crystals .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , the same conclusion is likely true for solids with disordered arrangements of magnetic nuclear sites , but further experimental and theoretical investigation of this situation is necessary ."
