    "precise measurements of primordial abundances of the light elements deuterium ( d ) , @xmath15he , @xmath16he , and @xmath17li relative to hydrogen have been a goal of astronomers for many years . in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model ,",
    "these quantities are related in a straightforward way to the baryon - to - photon ratio in the early universe , from which @xmath18 , the fraction of the critical density contributed by baryons , may be determined ( boesgard & steigman 1985 ) . in principle , a measurement of any single one of these abundance ratios would be sufficient to determine @xmath18 . in practice , however , the d / h ratio is more useful than the others for two reasons : ( 1 ) d / h is a stronger function of @xmath18 than the other light element ratios , and will yield a more accurate value of @xmath18 .",

    "no other significant production mechanisms have been identified ( reeves et al .",

    "since deuterium is easily destroyed in stellar interiors , the d / h ratio is expected to monotonically decrease with time .",

    "feige 110 was observed with",
    "_ fuse _  for a total of 28 ksec under two separate programs , m1080801 and p1044301 .",
    "the observation log is shown in table 1 .",
    "all data were obtained in histogram mode using the lwrs ( @xmath20 ) aperture .",
    "the data were reduced using calfuse pipeline version 1.8.7 .",
    "the individual 1-dimensional spectra were co - added to form the final spectrum for each channel and detector segment separately after removing the relative shifts between individual spectra on the detector caused by image and grating motion ( sahnow et al .",
    "the shifts were determined by cross - correlating the individual spectra over a limited wavelength range which contained prominent spectral features but no airglow lines .",
    "typical shifts were @xmath21 pixels , or @xmath22 .",
    "although _ fuse _",
    "observations of h@xmath0i  and o@xmath0i  lines are sometimes contaminated by airglow emission , requiring the use of data obtained only during spacecraft orbital night , it was found that this was unimportant in our analysis , and the combined day and night data were used .    most of our analysis was based on sic1b and sic2a spectra ( @xmath23  ) , which span the high order lyman lines ( ly@xmath24 through the lyman limit ) .",
    "sic2a generally has somewhat better spectral resolving power , but also suffers from more detector fixed - pattern noise . in rare cases ,",
    "fixed - pattern features can cause the detector response to vary by as much as 20% over very small scales , and while the resulting spectral features are sometimes diminished by the motion of the spectra on the detectors ( sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) they are not explicitly removed in the current calfuse pipeline reduction .",
    "this difficulty is ameliorated by the multiple channel design of _ fuse _ ; measurements of absorption lines that appear in the spectra of more than one channel are independent , which can help to distinguish between real and instrumentally - induced spectral features .",

    "the spectral resolution is about 17 km  s@xmath19(fwhm ) .",
    "typical s / n ratios for this observation are between 20 and 25 .    the h@xmath0i  column density along this line of sight was estimated using the lyman @xmath5 profile from the single high resolution spectrum of feige 110 taken with _ iue_. the 15.3 ksec observation was made on 15 october 1981 ( see table 1 ) , and reduced using iuesips .",
    "the analysis of these data is discussed in more detail in  5 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the important properties of feige 110 and the sight line to this star .",
    "the trigonometric parallax of feige  110 was measured to be @xmath25 milliarcsec using the hipparcos satellite ( perryman et al.1997 ) , which yields a distance of @xmath3 pc .",
    "the star lies in the direction ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) = ( 7409 , -5907 ) at z = @xmath4 pc from the galactic plane , well beyond the local interstellar cloud ( lallement & bertin 1992 ) , and probably beyond most of the neutral hydrogen associated with the wall of the local bubble ( sfeir et al .",
    "this is not true of most of the other local ism sight lines studied with",
    "( see moos et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , along this sight line we may be sampling different material , depending on the mixing efficiency over these length scales ( tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .",
    "the average hydrogen density along this sight line is @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath6(h@xmath0i)/d @xmath28 0.27 @xmath29 , and feige 110 is one of only two stars in the current _ fuse _  deuterium sample to show molecular hydrogen absorption ( the other being bd+284211 ; see sonneborn et al .",

    "feige  110 was discovered by feige ( 1958 ) in a search for underluminous hot stars brighter than 14 mag . in their study on the nature of faint blue stars ,",
    "greenstein & sargent ( 1974 ) analyzed the optical spectrum of feige  110 and obtained a rough estimate of its atmospheric parameters .",
    "heber et al .  (",
    "1984 ) improved greenstein and sargent s analysis by using nlte model atmospheres and determined @xmath30,000 k , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "based on the detection of strong balmer lines , weak @xmath334471 and @xmath334685 lines , heber et al .",
    "classified feige 110 as a subdwarf ob star ( sdob ) .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of feige  110 put it at the hot end of the sdb / sdob population , which includes he - burning stars having masses close to 0.5 m@xmath34 with very thin h - rich envelopes ( @xmath35 m@xmath34 ) ( see , e.g. , caloi 1989 ; dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "the parallax distance of feige  110 , 179 pc , is a factor of @xmath145 smaller than the distance computed using the atmospheric parameters obtained by heber et al.(1984 ) .",
    "this discrepancy prompted us to reanalyze the optical spectrum of feige  110 .",
    "we used three optical spectra : 1 ) a _ stis _ spectrum retrieved from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) ; 2 ) observations taken by one of us ( r.l . ) at cerro tololo inter - american observatory with the 4 m telescope ; and 3 ) observations obtained by r.  saffer ( private communication ) at kitt peak national observatory s 2.1 m telescope .",
    "we estimated the atmospheric parameters of feige  110 by comparing its optical spectrum to a grid of synthetic nlte stellar model atmosphere spectra .",
    "we used the programs tlusty / synspec ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) to compute models having a pure h and he composition .",
    "the grid covered the temperature range 35,@xmath36,000 k in steps of 5,000 k for five values of the surface gravity , @xmath37 , 5.0 , 5.5 , 6.0 , 6.5 , and for four values of the helium abundance , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "we obtained @xmath42,@xmath43000 k , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , by using a @xmath46 minimization technique to fit the observed spectra to the synthetic spectra .",
    "these parameters are the mean values obtained from the three optical spectra .",
    "the larger gravity derived here implies a lower luminosity for feige  110 than that derived by heber et al . , and consequently a lower distance . our computed distance ( @xmath47 pc ) , now agrees with the hipparcos parallax distance ( @xmath48 pc ) within the stated uncertainties .",
    "feige 110 displays a very complex far - ultraviolet spectrum ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the strong lyman series lines of h@xmath0i  ( ly@xmath49 up to ly10 ) and the lines ( @xmath331084 up to @xmath33942 ) are the dominant stellar features .",
    "we identified all the ism lines superimposed on the stellar spectrum of feige  110 , but were unable to identify many remaining photospheric lines .",
    "this identification is complicated by the lack of reliable atomic data , especially for the iron - peak elements .",
    "the strongest photospheric metal lines are the @xmath33923 sextuplet , @xmath50933 and 944 doublet , @xmath33955 , @xmath33979.9 quadruplet , @xmath50989.80 , 991.51 , and 991.58 triplet , and @xmath501118 and 1128 doublet .",
    "we identified photospheric lines from n , s , cr , fe , and ni .",
    "neither carbon ( @xmath331175 ) nor silicon ( @xmath501122.49 , 1128.33 , and 1128.49 ) was detected in the _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "this confirms the study of heber et al .",
    "( 1984 ) who reported the non - detection of carbon and silicon in the _ iue _  spectrum of feige  110 .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_f110 ] shows a comparison between the synthetic spectrum and a portion of the _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "the synthetic spectrum is computed using the atmospheric parameters listed in table 2 .",
    "all the elements from h to zn are included with solar abundances , except for he ( see table 2 ) , c ( @xmath51 solar ) , si ( @xmath52 solar ) , and cr ( 21 solar ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_f110 ] illustrates the difficulty in matching the model with the observed data , even though we use all atomic line data from the kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) database .",
    "the non - identification of stellar lines poses the problem of recognizing possible blends between the ism and photospheric lines .",
    "also , the placement of the continuum may be a problem in regions of the spectrum where many stellar lines are not identified .",
    "we take these uncertainties into consideration in our determination of the interstellar d@xmath0i  and o@xmath0i  column densities .",
    "in addition to h@xmath0i , d@xmath0i , and o@xmath0i , detected interstellar lines include h@xmath53 , n@xmath0i , , fe@xmath0ii , c@xmath0iii , , and .",
    "however , reliable determinations of the column densities of these species are difficult due to saturation and blending effects , and have not been done for this study .",
    "absorption line studies of the interstellar medium are best done with background sources consisting of hot stars with large @xmath54sin(@xmath55 ) values or few visible photospheric metal lines , both of which yield relatively smooth continua over the scale of typical ism absorption lines .",
    "unfortunately , feige 110 does not fit this description .",
    "the far - ultraviolet continuum is very complex ( figure  [ fig_s2aspec ] ) , primarily due to the large number of metal lines arising in the atmosphere of this sdob star .",
    "analysis of the d@xmath0i  and o@xmath0icolumn densities was possible only with a judicious choice of lines which were not too severely blended with photospheric features .",
    "proper continuum placement was somewhat uncertain and , in general , is the largest source of systematic errors in our measurements .",
    "two techniques have been used to estimate the column densities in this analysis .",
    "the first involves directly measuring the equivalent widths of absorption lines , which are fit to a single - component gaussian curve of growth ( cog ) ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "we are unaware of any high resolution optical or ultraviolet spectra that could reveal the presence of multiple components along this sight line .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence in the _ fuse _  spectra of multiple components , which would in any case be difficult to detect unless they were separated in velocity by at least @xmath1410 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "we therefore made the simplifying assumption that a single interstellar cloud with a maxwellian velocity distribution is responsible for the absorption .",
    "the estimates of the column density ( @xmath6 ) and doppler parameter ( @xmath2 ) derived from the cog are likely to include systematic errors due to this assumption .",
    "for example , the derived @xmath56value will not be a simple quadrature combination of thermal and turbulent velocity components , as it would be for a true single cloud .",
    "instead , it will also reflect the spread in velocities of the multiple clouds that are likely to lie along a sight line of this length .",
    "jenkins ( 1986 ) has discussed the systematic errors associated with the cog technique when there are multiple clouds of various strengths along a sight line , and has shown that if many non - saturated lines are used , and if the distribution of @xmath6 and @xmath56values in the clouds is not strongly bimodal , then the column density is likely to be underestimated by @xmath57 15% .    despite these shortcomings , the cog technique has the virtue of being unaffected in principle by convolution with the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) , provided that such convolution does not lead to unacceptable blending with neighboring lines . however",
    ", if there is a very broad component to the lsf , then in practice any technique may underestimate the column density of unsaturated components because an erroneous continuum placement could mask some fraction of the absorption .",
    "this is particularly important since the _ fuse _  lsf has not yet been well characterized , though it is known to have both broad ( @xmath1420 pixels ) and narrow ( @xmath1410 pixels ) components and to change as a function of wavelength .",
    "the second technique utilizes the profile fitting code owens.f , developed by m. lemoine and the french _ fuse _  science team .",
    "this code models the observed absorption lines with voigt profiles using a @xmath46 minimization procedure with many free parameters , including the line spread function , flux zero point , gas temperature , and turbulent velocity within the cloud .",
    "the application of owens.f to _ fuse _  data is described in greater detail by hebrard et al . ( 2001 ) . neither the cog nor profile",
    "fitting techniques include oscillator strength uncertainties in the error estimates .      to properly measure the d@xmath0i  equivalent widths the effects of the stellar h@xmath0ilyman series and absorption",
    "must be removed .",
    "this was done by shifting in velocity the synthetic stellar model discussed in  3 until the stellar h@xmath0i  damping wings matched the observed spectrum away from the cores of the interstellar hi lines .",
    "the resulting average velocity difference was @xmath58 km  s@xmath19  and @xmath59 km  s@xmath19  for the sic1b and sic2a spectra , respectively .",
    "this compares well with @xmath60 km  s@xmath19  from measurements of five si@xmath0ii ism lines and two n@xmath0v stellar lines in the _ iue _  spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig_stellar_cont ] shows the h@xmath0i  lines measured with _ fuse _  as well as the profiles from the stellar model .",
    "an additional correction to the d@xmath0i  absorption profiles was performed to remove blends with adjacent molecular hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "there are not enough unblended h@xmath53  lines to determine column densities of all the rotational levels of h@xmath53 .",
    "however , only lines in the @xmath61 rotational levels of h@xmath53  are blended with the observed d@xmath0i  lines , and the column densities are small enough as to require only minor corrections . therefore , we fit gaussians to the observed profiles of unblended h@xmath53  lines in the same rotational levels as those overlapping the d@xmath0i  transitions , and scaled by the relative @xmath62 values to estimate the strength of the contaminating h@xmath53  lines .",
    "the estimated h@xmath53  absorption was then divided out of the stellar - normalized d@xmath0iprofile .",
    "table 3 lists the unblended h@xmath53  lines and the measured equivalent widths used to determine the h@xmath53  corrections .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( @xmath63 ) of the cleaned d@xmath0i  lines after fitting low - order legendre polynomials to the local continuum profiles .",
    "this process allowed us to remove small residual flux discrepancies between the stellar model and the observed spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig_di_cont ] shows the continuum - normalized d@xmath0i  profiles and our estimate of the h@xmath53  contamination of the d@xmath0i  lines .",
    "the interstellar lines are at a heliocentric velocity km  s@xmath19 . ] of @xmath64 km  s@xmath19 , base on the _ iue _  data .",
    "each line was integrated over velocity limits that depended on blending and local fixed - pattern noise .",
    "the effects of scattered light are negligibly small for the d@xmath0i  cog analysis , and no correction was made .",
    "the measured equivalent widths are given in table 4 .",
    "the estimated errors from this method ( described in detail by sembach & savage 1992 ) include contributions from both statistical and fixed - pattern noise in the local continuum , but do not include a contribution from systematic continuum placement errors of the type considered below .",
    "the @xmath63 measurements were placed on a best - fit curve of growth , as shown in figure  [ fig_cog ] .",
    "lines from both the sic1b and sic2a spectra were used , with the exception of the ly@xmath65 937.548   line in sic2a . as shown in figure  [ fig_di_cont ]",
    "this line is much stronger than expected .",
    "it is stronger than the same line in the sic1b spectrum , a comparison which demonstrates the utility of the multi - channel design of _ fuse _ , and stronger than the ly@xmath66 949.484   line , which can not be correct .",
    "we believe the apparent strength of the line is due to a fixed - pattern effect on the detector , and this line is ignored in the remaining analysis .",
    "the systematic error on each equivalent width measurement is dominated by uncertainties in the placement of the continuum .",
    "we estimate the systematic continuum placement uncertainties using the following procedure .",
    "first , the best estimate of @xmath63 for each line was determined using what we consider to be the proper continuum placement , and integrating over an appropriate velocity interval .",
    "next , the maximum plausible @xmath63 was determined by placing the continuum at its maximum reasonable position in the region of the absorption line , and integrating over the largest reasonable velocity interval .",
    "then the minimum plausible @xmath63 was measured using a similar procedure .",
    "the difference between these maximum and minimum values and the best value , whichever is greater , is taken to be a @xmath67 systematic error .",
    "half of this value is combined in quadrature with the statistical error on the equivalent width measurement to give the total @xmath68 uncertainty .",
    "the column density computed using the cog analysis is log @xmath6(d@xmath0i)@xmath69=@xmath70 ( @xmath67 ) and the doppler parameter is @xmath2=@xmath71 km  s@xmath19(@xmath67 ) .",
    "an independent calculation of the d@xmath0i  column density was made using the profile code owens.f .",
    "seven d@xmath0i  lines in eleven separate spectral windows from the sic1b and sic2a spectra were simultaneously fit to the stellar continuum normalized profiles described above . each line was constrained to a common value of the radial velocity , column density , and temperature .",
    "the continuum shape , zero flux level , and lsf were allowed to vary in each spectral window encompassing a d@xmath0i  line .",
    "the lsf was modelled as a gaussian , with a fwhm that was in the range @xmath72 pixels ( 16 - 25 km  s@xmath19 ) , depending on wavelength .",
    "a scattered light correction was made by adjusting the flux at the bottom of each neighboring saturated h@xmath0i  line to zero . to account for small errors in the wavelength calibration",
    ", wavelength shifts between spectral windows were permitted in the fit .",
    "the fits for each d@xmath0i  line are shown in figure  [ fig_owens ] . displayed for each line",
    "are the observed data , the continuum , and the fit after convolution with the instrumental lsf .",
    "various tests were done to investigate the magnitude of possible systematic uncertainties associated with the profile fitting procedure .",
    "these are described in detail in hebrard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and include modelling the lsf with two gaussians , fitting the continua with polynomials up to order 14 , and varying the zero flux level from zero to twice the level at the base of each neighboring h@xmath0i  line .",
    "the results of these tests helped determine the magnitude of the d@xmath0i  column density error .",
    "the column density computed using the profile fitting analysis is log @xmath6(d@xmath0i)@xmath73=@xmath74 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we take the weighted mean of the results from the curve of growth and profile fitting procedures to arrive at our best estimate of the d@xmath0i  column density , log @xmath6(d@xmath0i)=@xmath7 ( @xmath67 ) . to be conservative ,",
    "we have not reduced the error below that determined from the cog result because the error is dominated by systematic effects and can not be combined in the usual statistical fashion .",
    "the o@xmath0i  column density is derived using only a cog analysis .",
    "most of the o@xmath0ilines are saturated or nearly so , which makes a profile fitting analysis difficult , especially when there are significant uncertainties in the lsf and velocity structure of the absorption profiles , as is the case in this study .",
    "in contrast to the d@xmath0i  analysis , no stellar model was removed prior to measuring the o@xmath0i  lines since the stellar profile is only slowly varying in the vicinity of these lines .",
    "the local continuum was fit using the same procedure described above for measuring the equivalent widths .",
    "no strong h@xmath53  lines are blended with any of the o@xmath0i  lines used in the analysis , so no correction for h@xmath53  was required . small residual flux contributed by scattered light or a broad lsf",
    "has a larger effect on the estimated equivalent widths of the more saturated o@xmath0ilines than the d@xmath0i  lines .",
    "therefore , for each o@xmath0i  line a correction was made by measuring the flux at the bottom of a neighboring saturated h@xmath0i  line , the magnitude of which was typically @xmath142% of the local continuum flux . including this correction had a negligible effect on the calculated column density , but slightly increased the estimated error .",
    "the analysis was done in the same way as for the d@xmath0i  lines , again assuming a single - component gaussian curve of growth .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors were calculated and combined in the same way as for d@xmath0i .",
    "however , an additional error term resulting from a 2% uncertainty in the zero flux level ( sembach & savage 1992 ) was combined in quadrature with this to determine the final error .",
    "our best fit cog estimate gives log @xmath6(oi)=@xmath8 ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath2=@xmath75 km  s@xmath19(@xmath67 ) .",
    "the continuum normalized o@xmath0i  profiles are shown in figure  [ fig_oi_cont ] , and the measured equivalent widths are given in table 5 .",
    "the cog is displayed in figure  [ fig_cog ] .",
    "in the direction of feige 110 , the ly@xmath5  line provides the best constraint on the total h@xmath0i  column density because its radiation damping wings are very strong .",
    "ly@xmath5  is not accessible to _ fuse_. while the remaining lyman series lines recorded in the _ fuse _  spectrum are strongly saturated , they are not sufficiently strong to show well - developed damping wings .",
    "we have examined the range of @xmath56value / column density combinations allowed by the higher lyman series lines in the _ fuse _  spectrum , and we find that these lines do not constrain @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) with sufficient precision to provide an interesting d / h measurement . at the time of this writing no suitable _ hst _ spectra of the feige 110 ly@xmath5  line had been obtained .",
    "consequently , we have used the only high - dispersion echelle observation of this star obtained with the short wavelength camera on _ iue _  ( exposure i d swp15270 ) to estimate @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) toward feige 110 .",
    "this _ iue _",
    "mode provides a resolution of @xmath1425 km  s@xmath19  fwhm and covers the 1150 - 1950   range .",
    "the high - dispersion _ iue _  observation was obtained on 1981 october 15 with an exposure time of 15.3 ksec .",
    "we reduced the data using the iuedr processing ( giddings & rees 1989 ) .",
    "this reduction properly traces the echelle orders and corrects for scattered light .",
    "note that both the iuesips and newsips reductions , which are available from the stsci mast archive , have significant difficulties which make them less suitable for this analysis .",
    "the iuesips reduction was performed with the an early version of iuesips software , and was never reprocessed with the later , improved version .",
    "it apparently does not trace the orders properly , and therefore some of the signal is improperly excluded , giving rise to undulations in the extracted spectrum . in the newsips reduction",
    "the background subtraction is poor . in the fully saturated ly@xmath5core , which should be centered on zero flux",
    ", the newsips spectrum shows a significant residual flux equal to @xmath1416@xmath7619% of the continuum flux .",
    "furthermore , the core is not flat ; the residual flux is higher on the red side than on the blue side .",
    "the iuedr reduction does not suffer from any of these difficulties .      to measure the total interstellar h@xmath0i  column density , we used the method of jenkins ( 1971 ) ;",
    "see also jenkins et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sonneborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in brief",
    ", we constrained the h@xmath0i  column density using the lorentzian wings of the ly@xmath5  profile , which have optical depth @xmath77 at wavelength @xmath33 given by @xmath78(h@xmath0i)@xmath79(h@xmath0i)@xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath81 is the centroid of the interstellar h@xmath0i  absorption in this direction , which was determined from the triplet at 1200  .",
    "we estimated the value of @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) that provides the best fit to the ly@xmath5  profile by minimizing @xmath82 using powell s method with five free parameters : ( 1 ) @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) , ( 2)-(4 ) three coefficients that fit a second - order polynomial to the continuum ( with a model stellar ly@xmath5  line superimposed , see below ) , and ( 5 ) a correction for the flux zero level .",
    "we then increased ( or decreased ) @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) while allowing the other free parameters to vary in order to set upper and lower confidence limits based on the ensuing changes in @xmath82 .",
    "in addition to the ly@xmath5  absorption profile due to interstellar h@xmath0i  , a subdwarf star like feige 110 will have a substantial stellar ly@xmath5  absorption line with broad , lorentzian wings as well .",
    "neglect of this stellar line when setting the continuum for fitting the interstellar ly@xmath5  will lead to a substantial systematic overestimate of @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) .",
    "we have used the stellar atmosphere models discussed in  3 to account for the stellar ly@xmath5  line .",
    "figure  [ stlya ] shows with a solid line the continuum- normalized stellar ly@xmath5  + he absorption profile predicted for the most likely combination of @xmath83 , log @xmath84 , and he / h for this star .",
    "we superimposed the normalized stellar profile on a second - order polynomial to allow for possible instrumental calibration problems ( see above ) .",
    "the offset of the stellar line centroid with respect to the interstellar lines was determined by comparing the velocities of several stellar and interstellar lines in the _ fuse _  spectrum , and the uncertainty in the determined offset has a negligible impact on the derived @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ stlya ] indicate the shallowest and deepest stellar profiles derived from a grid of models covering the expected range of atmospheric parameters for feige 110 .",
    "we use these `` extreme '' stellar profiles to set upper and lower confidence limits on @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) in the following section . for purposes of illustration",
    ", the dashed line shows the stellar ly@xmath5line predicted for the atmospheric parameters derived for feige 110 by heber et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ; the impact of the stellar model revision on the derived interstellar @xmath6 ( ) is discussed below .",
    "figure  [ hifit ] shows the _ iue _  spectrum of feige 110 ; the same data are plotted in both panels but the upper panel shows a broader wavelength range to enable the reader to inspect the fit to continuum away from the strong ly@xmath5absorption .",
    "overplotted on the spectrum with dashed lines are the fits that provide 2@xmath10 upper and lower limits on the interstellar @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) .",
    "the continua adopted for these 2@xmath10 limits are shown with dotted lines ( the higher continuum corresponds to the upper limit ) .",
    "as noted above , in addition to the differing overall continuum level , the deepest model stellar ly@xmath5  line is assumed for the lower limit on @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) , and the shallowest stellar ly@xmath5model is assumed for the upper limit . from these fits",
    "we derive log @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) = 20.14@xmath9 ( 2@xmath10 ) .",
    "we note that the revision of the stellar atmosphere parameters discussed in  3 has a substantial impact on the derived interstellar @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) .",
    "if we use the older , heber et al .",
    "( 1984 ) atmospheric parameters to synthesize the stellar ly@xmath5  line , we obtain the stellar profile shown with a dashed line in figure  [ stlya ] . with this stellar profile",
    ", we obtain an h@xmath0i  column density which is @xmath85 dex higher than that derived with our preferred stellar atmosphere parameters ( see table 2 ) , where this range of values depends on the choice of continuum placement .",
    "evidently , with this type of star , uncertainties in the stellar ly@xmath5  line can introduce significant systematic errors into interstellar @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) estimates .",
    "this also demonstrates the need for high quality optical data to tightly constrain the stellar model parameters .",
    "there are , of course , many potential sources of error in estimating @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) based only on an _ iue _  ly@xmath5  spectrum . to improve the estimate we attempted to measure @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) by fitting the ly@xmath49  and ly@xmath24  lines in the _ fuse _  data .",
    "however , several difficulties prevent these from further constraining @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) .",
    "for example , the stellar model does not include all metal lines actually present in the stellar spectrum ( see  3 and fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_f110 ] ) .",
    "the deviation of the model from the observed spectrum due to this line blanketing in many narrow spectral windows means that the effective continuum emerging from the star is overestimated by an unknown amount .",
    "although this problem exists for all ly lines , it is much less serious for ly@xmath5  because in this case the interstellar lorentzian wings are stronger and much broader than the stellar lorentzian profile .",
    "the opposite is true for ly@xmath49  and all higher ly series lines .",
    "thus , the continuum around ly@xmath49  is much more steeply sloping , and much harder to fit properly , and this is even worse around ly@xmath24 .    complicating the issue of proper continuum placement are the effects of extraneous interstellar lines in the vicinity of the h@xmath0i  and d@xmath0i  lines .",
    "problematic species include o@xmath0i  and h@xmath53 , neither of which affect the ly@xmath5profile .    because of",
    "these problems the analysis of the ly@xmath49  and ly@xmath24  lines did not allow an improved estimate of @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) and we have relied exclusively on the _ iue _  ly@xmath5  data . as discussed above , the systematic error associated with this is due primarily to unrecognized , narrow stellar lines .",
    "we have included the effects of known stellar lines in the continuum regions used to estimate @xmath10 for the @xmath82 calculation , but nevertheless future higher resolution and signal - to - noise observations that will allow us to mask out the strong stellar lines might yield a different result . for this reason , it would be highly valuable to re - observe feige 110 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph on board _",
    "hst_. sonneborn et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown , using high - resolution stis observations of bd+28@xmath864211 , that such an observation can yield a very precise measurement of @xmath6(h@xmath0i ) , even for a subdwarf like feige 110 .",
    "we have measured the column densities of d@xmath0i , o@xmath0i , and h@xmath0i  toward feige 110 , the longest sight line with the highest h@xmath0i  column density of those reported in the initial set of deuterium studies with _ fuse_. our results are summarized in table 6 .",
    "the d@xmath0i  column density was measured with two independent techniques , which give nearly the same result , despite being subject to a much different set of systematic errors .",
    "this agreement reflects the fact that there are many weak , unsaturated d@xmath0i  lines available for analysis , and shows the benefits of observing the high - order lyman lines available with _",
    "fuse_. the situation for o@xmath0i  is not as favorable , since most of the available lines are saturated or nearly so .",
    "this is the reason for the larger uncertainty associated with this column density measurement .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to draw useful conclusions about the ratios of d@xmath0i , o@xmath0i , and h@xmath0i .    using our best column density estimates we find d / h = @xmath87 this deviates from some , but not all , values along sight lines both within the local bubble and beyond ( moos et al .",
    "2001 ; linsky 1998 ; jenkins et al . 1999 ; sonneborn et al .",
    "this suggests that the d / h ratio toward feige 110 differs from that along other sight lines , both longer and shorter .",
    "this important conclusion is discussed more fully by moos et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who show that there is no evidence of variability within the local bubble , at distances less than @xmath14100 pc , but there is significant variability at larger distances .",
    "this is discussed within the context of mixing of interstellar material driven by supernova explosions . for a uniform supernova explosion rate ,",
    "material in the region may be well mixed over scales of @xmath14100 pc .",
    "but if supernova events are episodic , such as those that are triggered in ob associations , there may be insufficient time to mix the material to achieve the uniformity observed in the current d / h studies .",
    "other effects , such as the gas temperature , the volume density , and the magnetic field strength in the ism , must be included in the models to accurately characterize the mixing time and length scales .",
    "the measurements discussed here and by moos et al . may constrain these models .",
    "our result o / h = @xmath88 , while not very precise , is in agreement with previous measurements of o / h .",
    "meyer , jura , & cardelli ( 1998 ) found remarkable uniformity , o / h = @xmath89 for 13 sight lines ranging in distance from 130 to 1500 pc , where the error is the @xmath67 dispersion in the measured values .",
    "( we have increased their published ratio by about 7.5% to account for a change in the o@xmath0i  1356 oscillator strength recommended by welty et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . )",
    "moos et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find no evidence of o / h variability in the sight lines studied with _",
    "fuse_.    a very sensitive test of the idea that the deuterium abundance is decreasing with time due to stellar astration is the spatial distribution of the d / o ratio .",
    "the ionization potential of neutral h and d ( 13.598 ev ) and o ( 13.618 ev ) are nearly identical .",
    "charge exchange reactions between h , d , and o keep the ionization fractions coupled such that d@xmath0i / o@xmath0i  is a good approximation of d / o .",
    "we find d / o = @xmath90 .",
    "moos et al . ( 2001 ) find no statistically significant spatial variation in this quantity , although the scatter about the mean value decreases if only the targets within the local bubble are considered .",
    "furthermore , they find no evidence of anti - correlation between d / o and o / h .",
    "although the metallicity range of these local ism studies is small , this may indicate that some subtle nucleosynthetic processes are affecting the d / o ratio .",
    "one possibility discussed by moos et al .",
    "is that there are stellar processes which destroy weakly bound deuterium nuclei without creating significant quantities of oxygen , and stellar winds mix this deuterium depleted material into the ism .",
    "additional measurements using _ fuse _ , some of which probe sight lines to more distant targets and are currently under study , will shed more light on this interesting possibility .",
