    "it is commonly believed that the existence of dark matter can account for the missing mass in galaxies , galaxy clusters and our universe .",
    "however , the nature of dark matter remains a fundamental problem in astrophysics .",
    "if the dark matter particles are cold and collisionless , @xmath0-body simulations show that the density profile should be singular at the center ( a cusp profile , @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "this model generally gives good agreements with observations on large - scale structures such as ly@xmath2 spectrum @xcite and some galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "however , observations reveal that cores exist in many galaxies ( @xmath3 with @xmath4 ) , especially in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "some dwarf galaxies can even have @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is commonly known as the core - cusp problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent studies show that this problem might also be assoicated with another problem , called the too - big - to - fail ( tbtf ) problem .",
    "this problem illustrates the fact that the densities of dark matter subhaloes which surround nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies are significantly lower than those of the most massive subhaloes expected around a normal sized galaxies in cosmological simulations @xcite . in other words , solving the core - cusp problem might also provide a solution to the tbtf problem @xcite .",
    "some proposals have been suggested to solve the core - cusp problem .",
    "for example , the existence of kev dark matter particles , as a candidate of warm dark matter ( wdm ) , has been proposed to solve the problem @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations indicate that the simplest model of wdm ( e.g. the non - resonant sterile neutrino model ) can not account for the major component of dark matter @xcite .",
    "some extra properties of wdm or free parameters are needed in order to satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "some recent analyses even suggest that wdm model can not solve the core - cusp problem @xcite .",
    "another proposal suggests that core - like structures would be produced if dark matter particles are self - interacting @xcite .",
    "simulations show that dark matter particles with a constant cross - section per unit mass @xmath6 @xmath7 g@xmath8 can produce core - like structures in galaxies @xcite . unfortunately , recent observations put a tight constraint on the cross - section : @xmath9 @xmath7 g@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it leaves only a small window open for this velocity - independent self - interacting dark matter model to work @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this model might still endure if the cross - section is velocity - dependent , though some more parameters have to be involved @xcite .",
    "besides the above two proposals , some suggest that the energy exchange between baryons and dark matter particles might also be possible to produce core - like structures .",
    "these mechanisms include the steller and supernova feedback @xcite , and dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "it is now a controversial issue because these baryonic processes involve some uncertainties , such as the total energy released by the supernovae and the fraction of energy that can be transferred to the dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "for example , for a total mass of @xmath10 , recent studies show that at least @xmath11 of supernova energy is required to transfer to the dark matter halo to give @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "however , we are not sure whether this fraction of transferred energy is physically possible or not .",
    "also , it is challenging to invoke baryonic processes as the main mechanisms to solve the core - cusp problem for some dark - matter - dominated galaxies because the baryonic content is too small to affect the dark matter distribution @xcite .    in this article ,",
    "i suggest another proposal that the core - cusp problem can be solved by sommerfeld - enhanced dark matter annihilation . the possibility of the dark matter annihilation to solve the core - cusp problem is first suggested in @xcite .",
    "the required annihilation cross - section is @xmath13 @xmath14 s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "they suggest two possible mechanisms so that the required cross - section would not violate the relic dark matter annihilation cross - section @xmath15 @xmath16 s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , if the annihilation products are visible particles such as neutrinos , electrons or photons , this required cross - section is ruled out by observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , this model predicts that halo core density is universal ( @xmath17 pc@xmath18 ) @xcite while observations indicate that the core density of dwarf galaxies varies from @xmath19 pc@xmath18 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "i use the idea from @xcite but assume that the dark matter annihilation is enhanced by the sommerfeld s mechanism ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , and the annihilation products are invisible sterile neutrinos only .",
    "it can be shown that a significant amount of dark matter particles would be annihilated , which is enough to produce the observed core - like structures in galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested that dark matter would self - annihilate to give smaller particles with high energy .",
    "the possible stable products formed are photons , electron - positron pairs , and neutrinos .",
    "in particular , the fact that active neutrino have non - zero rest mass probably suggests that right - handed neutrinos should exist , which may indeed be sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "some recent models suggest that dark matter particles can annihilate dominantly into light dark neutrinos ( sterile neutrinos ) via exchange of a higgs field ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "this model can agree with the results obtained from dama @xcite and cogent @xcite experiments , which point toward light dark matter ( @xmath22 gev ) with isospin - violating and possibly inelastic couplings @xcite .",
    "however , the light dark matter model is largely constrained by observations , such as cosmic microwave background and superk limits . cline and frey ( 2012 )",
    "@xcite propose a model of quasi - dirac dark matter , interacting via two gauge bosons , one of which couples to baryon number and the other which kinetically mixes with the photon .",
    "the annihilation product is dark neutrinos that do not mix with the standard model .",
    "they also show that the dark neutrinos produced in the universe would not violate the current observational bounds @xcite .    in the following , we are going to discuss the consequences of the sterile neutrinos being the only dark matter annihilation product ( the model proposed in @xcite may be one of the possible scenarios ) .",
    "if the annihilation cross - section is large enough due to the sommerfeld enhancement , a significant amount of dark matter would be changed to high energy sterile neutrinos .",
    "these high energy sterile neutrinos would finally leave the structure and make the central density lower .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement arises when a scattering object is coupled to a light mediator particle @xcite .",
    "this enhancement can increase the cross - section for annihilation process in a velocity - dependent fashion due to the generic attractive force between the incident dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "if dark matter particles were produced at the very beginning , the annihilation cross - section should be close to @xmath23 @xmath16 s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , the sommerfeld enhancement might significantly change the relic annihilation cross - section to a lower value @xcite .",
    "the actual value of the annihilation cross - section at the thermal freeze out is model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite show that the sommerfeld enhancement near resonance would suppress the dark matter abundance by a factor of a few .",
    "as a result , the annihilation cross section needs to be suppressed by this same factor in order to be consistent with the observed relic density .",
    "therefore , we write the annihilation cross section at the thermal freeze out as @xmath24 @xmath16 s@xmath8 , where @xmath25 is a model - dependent parameter . here , @xmath26 is the velocity of the dark matter particles at decoupling @xcite .",
    "if the velocity of dark matter particles @xmath27 is lower , the sommerfeld enhancement might increase the cross - section to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is close to 1 for non - resonance case while @xmath29 for resonance @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low velocity of dark matter particles in a galaxy or galaxy cluster would increase the rate of annihilation to form core - like structures .",
    "also , this cross - section satisfies the unitarity bound . harling and petraki ( 2014 )",
    "@xcite obtain the unitarity bound ( upper bound ) of the sommerfeld - enhanced cross - section , which is just a factor of 3 greater than the unitarity bound without sommerfeld enhancement . for @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 km",
    "/ s , the unitarity bound is @xmath32 @xmath16 s@xmath8 @xcite , which is much greater than the cross - section considered in our model .    on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of sterile neutrinos as a by - product of dark matter annihilation would change the effective number of neutrinos ( @xmath33 ) in cosmology .",
    "this number is strongly constrained by cosmic microwave background anisotropies recently , which gives @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath33 depends on the kinetic decoupling temperature of dark matter @xmath35 , which is a model - dependent parameter in cosmology . assuming a reliable range @xmath36 mev ( at @xmath37 s after big bang ) @xcite , the number density of active neutrinos is @xmath38 cm@xmath18 .",
    "the number density of sterile neutrinos produced from dark matter annihilation is given by @xmath40 cm@xmath18 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mass density of dark matter and the age of universe at the kinetic decoupling respectively .",
    "therefore , the sterile neutrinos produced at the kinetic decoupling are negligible compared with the relic active neutrinos .",
    "since the scale factor dependence are the same for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the sterile neutrinos produced would not significantly affect @xmath33 .",
    "since the mass of the mediator particle @xmath45 must be smaller than the dark matter mass @xcite , this requires @xmath46 mev - 1 gev .",
    "this new scalar field is likely to mix with the higgs boson and possibly be in tension with current collider constraints . in view of this , a study in @xcite examines this mixing effect seriously by assuming @xmath46 gev for the sommerfeld enhancement . since the mixing between the scalar field and the higgs field involves some unknown free parameters , including @xmath45 and the mixing angle @xmath47 , a large area of parameter space is still possible to satisfy the constraints obtained in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments @xcite . for the cms measurements , there is an experimental upper limit for the higgs total width of cross coupling .",
    "based on the calculations in @xcite , the upper limit of the higgs-@xmath48 cross coupling @xmath49 converges to about 0.05 for @xmath50 gev , which is not a prohibited value .    besides the higgs constraints",
    ", the mediator particle would probably emit photons or charged bosons which would possibly conflict with the constraints from indirect detection experiments .",
    "however , the emission of photons by the mediator is model - dependent . for example",
    ", a study in @xcite estimates a corresponding annihilation cross section by considering two dark matter particles annihilating via an intermediate pseudoscalar @xmath51 and a charged fermion @xmath52 in the loop ( see the feymann diagram in @xcite ) . for a small coupling ( @xmath53 ) , the model gives @xmath54 @xmath16 s@xmath8 @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the mass of the pseudoscalar particle and the fermion respectively @xcite .",
    "for @xmath58 gev , this cross - section is well - below any current constraint .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations should be performed in order to obtain a precise picture of dark matter density profile @xmath59 with annihilation . however , as we will see later , the annihilation is important only when the time @xmath60 is sufficiently large ( @xmath61 gyr ) .",
    "therefore , we can simply ignore the dynamics of the halo formation and assume that the initial dark matter density profile follows the nfw profile @xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are scale density and scale radius of a structure respectively .",
    "numerical simulations show that @xmath65 pc@xmath66 @xcite , where @xmath67 is the total mass of a structure .",
    "the time evolution of the dark matter density profile @xmath59 is given by @xmath68 ^ 2<\\sigma v_0>v_0^{\\alpha}}{m[v(r , t)]^{\\alpha}}.\\ ] ] moreover , in a stable configuration , the circular velocity of dark matter should depend on the mass profile @xmath69 of a structure : @xmath70 . according to virial theorem and observations ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the relative velocity of the annihilating dark matter particles follows the velocity profile @xmath72 .",
    "it is believed that most galaxies , including dwarf galaxies , have a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath73 at the center @xcite .",
    "therefore we write @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the mass profile of dark matter . here",
    ", we do not include the baryonic component because we find that different functional forms of baryonic mass profile just affect the resultant density profile slightly ( for example , the difference between using an isothermal and a constant baryonic profile is less than 1% in the resultant density profile ) .",
    "while in galaxy clusters , we have @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mass profile of baryonic matter .",
    "the baryonic component is important when @xmath78 is very small because most of the dark matter is annihilated and there is no supermassive black hole at the centre of galaxy cluster ( except cd clusters ) . in general , the locations of the galactic supermassive black holes in a galaxy cluster are usually far away from the gravitational centre of galaxy cluster ( except cd clusters ) .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath79 for small @xmath78 because they do not have any significant effect on the central density of galaxy cluster . the baryonic component can be simply modelled by a constant density profile for small @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "it is significant only when @xmath80 kpc .",
    "since the velocity profile is also time - dependent , eq .  ( 2 ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "nevertheless , we can discuss some important features and behaviours of the resulting dark matter density profile by using some analytic approximations , especially for small @xmath78 regime .    in a typical galaxy",
    ", we have @xmath81 at small @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the total mass profile is time and radius independent ( @xmath82 ) near the galactic centre . in this regime , eq .",

    "when @xmath85 dominates the mass profile , the total mass would be time and radius dependent .",
    "nevertheless , if we neglect the time - evolution factor ( it is a good approximation only near the core radius , and when @xmath60 is small ) , we can get an approximate analytic expression by using @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "( 2 ) gives @xmath88^{-1}=\\left ( \\frac{r}{\\rho_sr_s}+k'r^{-\\alpha/2}t \\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ]    moreover , since @xmath79 for small @xmath78 in most of the galaxy clusters , the baryonic component will dominate the mass profile for very small @xmath78 when most of the dark matter near the centre is annihilated ( @xmath60 is sufficiently large ) . in this case , the total mass profile is just radius - dependent .",
    "we have @xmath89^{-1}=\\left ( \\frac{r}{\\rho_sr_s}+\\tilde{k}r^{-\\alpha}t \\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the central baryon density . since @xmath91 , from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we notice that @xmath59 will rise again towards small @xmath78 for both galaxies and galaxy clusters .    from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we can see that there exists a turning point in the density when @xmath92 for dwarf and normal galaxies .",
    "therefore , the core radius of the structure @xmath93 should be the same order of magnitude as the position of the turning point . for @xmath94 and taking @xmath95 pc@xmath66 for dwarf and normal galaxy scale @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath96 kpc , which is too small to be the core radius . for @xmath97 , we get @xmath98 kpc , which generally agrees with observations .",
    "this shows that our model is consistent only with @xmath97 .",
    "let s assume that @xmath99 gev , @xmath100 and @xmath97 . by solving eq .",
    "( 2 ) numerically with small time - steps , we can generate the time evolution of @xmath59 for a typical dwarf galaxy , normal galaxy and galaxy cluster , respectively ( see figs .  1 - 3 ) .",
    "all the parameters used are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use the empirical formula from @xcite to model the corresponding mass of supermassive black hole in a typical dwarf galaxy and in a normal galaxy .",
    "we can notice from the figures that the density fluctuates at small @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with the features obtained from the approximate analytic expressions in eqs .",
    "( 3)-(5 ) .",
    "the inner slope is much shallower than the nfw profile .",
    "secondly , neglecting the fluctuations of density for small @xmath78 , we approximate the resultant density profile with a cored - nfw profile @xmath101 in each case .",
    "the core radii are @xmath102 kpc and @xmath103 kpc for galaxy and galaxy cluster respectively .",
    "the small core radii in dwarf galaxy and normal galaxy generally agree with observations @xcite . however , the structure of core in galaxy cluster is not obvious and the core radius is too small for us to observe .",
    "current observational data from galaxy clusters for @xmath104 kpc is highly uncertain .",
    "this may explain why core - like structures are not commonly found in galaxy clusters , even though they might exist .",
    ".the parameters used in our model . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting density profile in our model is somewhat different from the result obtained from @xcite .",
    "it is because the cross - section used in @xcite is constant while the cross - section in this model is velocity - dependent .",
    "4 shows a plot of the velocity profiles of dark matter particles in a typical galaxy and a typical dwarf galaxy at @xmath105 gyr . we can notice that the drop and rise in the resulting density profile strongly correlates with the velocity profile of dark matter .",
    "if there is no supermassive black hole or baryon in the structure ( i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath106 ) , the resulting density profile can be approximated by eq .",
    "( 4 ) only ( density decreases towards the centre ) , and the shape of the density profile would be similar to the one shown in fig .  3 because the effect of baryon in galaxy cluster is nearly negligible . if there is no sommerfeld enhancement ( i.e. @xmath107 ) , from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , the resulting central density profile would be constant ( @xmath108 ) , which reduces to the result obtained from @xcite .    on the other hand , fig .",
    "5 shows that core - like structure disappears when @xmath73 is large ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "since large @xmath73 usually correspond to large galactic mass @xcite , this suggests that core - like structures can be easily found in dwarf galaxies but not in large galaxies ( with mass greater than @xmath110 ) .",
    "if we take the local maximum turning point of the density profile being the core radius @xmath93 , the mass profile at @xmath111 would be dominated by dark matter . at the turning point , from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we have @xmath112 , where @xmath113 gyr is the age of a galaxy .",
    "the central density is given by @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath115 . as @xmath116 ,",
    "our result is consistent with the empirical fits from observational data @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "since this is a slow varying function of @xmath67 , the product @xmath118 pc@xmath66 is nearly a constant for dwarf galaxies and normal galaxies , which agrees with the empirical fits using some cored - density profiles @xmath119 pc@xmath66 @xcite . for @xmath120 in dwarf galaxies ,",
    "our result gives @xmath121 pc@xmath18 , which matches the average central density ( @xmath122 pc@xmath18 ) in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , since many dark matter particles are annihilated , the central density become much smaller .",
    "this would provide a possible solution to solve the tbtf problem @xcite .",
    "for @xmath123 pc , the dark matter density is less than @xmath124 g cm@xmath18 in a dwarf galaxy .",

    "in this article , i show that the sommerfeld - enhanced invisible dark matter annihilation is able to solve the core - cusp problem and obtain some general features that agree with observations . in order to produce the observed core size in galaxies",
    ", the value of @xmath2 should be around 2 , which means that the sommerfeld boost is very close to resonance .",
    "since the annihilation products are invisible sterile neutrinos , the sommerfeld - enhanced cross - section basically does not violate any observational bounds .",
    "this model can also give a satisfactory explanation why core - like structures commonly found in dwarf galaxies , but not in galaxy clusters .",
    "it is because the core size is too small to be observed in galaxy clusters .",
    "moreover , this model just involves only two free parameters , the mass of supermassive black hole @xmath73 , and the mass of a dark matter particle @xmath130 , which is assumed to be 1 gev ( the free parameter @xmath52 can combine with @xmath130 to become a single parameter @xmath131 ) . in general , a smaller value of @xmath130 would give a more obvious core - like structure and a lower central density . since our result is consistent with the typical value of central density in galaxies , the value of @xmath130 should be of the order 1 gev .",
    "since a significant amount of dark matter would be annihilated , the dark matter content would be smaller in the inner region .",
    "based on our calculations , more than 60% of the dark matter would be annihilated within 1 kpc .",
    "surprisingly , this agrees with recent observations that the dark matter content is close to zero for the central part of galaxies @xcite .",
    "some observations also reveal that the dark matter content decreases with decreasing radius @xcite , which could also be explained by a higher rate of dark matter annihilation in the inner radius .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to have a very tiny baryonic branching ratio of the annihilation such that some photons or electron - positron pairs are directly created .",
    "however , the branching ratio should be less than @xmath132 for these visible channels in order to satisfy the observational bounds @xcite .    in our model , although the inner slope of the density is much shallower than the nfw profile , the inner central density is not really a constant .",
    "however , due to observational uncertainties , the small fluctuations in the inner small region are usually smoothed out by using a constant density profile .",
    "if we have some good techniques in the future that can precisely probe the central density of dark matter , our model can be severely tested by three ways .",
    "first , the inner dark matter density is smaller than the nfw profile and goes like @xmath133 when @xmath73 dominates the central mass .",
    "second , there is a peak and trough in the dark matter density profile near the core radius .",
    "third , our model predicts that core - like structures disappear in galaxies with large supermassive black holes .",
    "these features would be able to detect if we can precisely obtain the baryon density profile in galaxies or galaxy clusters in the future .",
