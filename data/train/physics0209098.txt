    "reaction paths in large molecular systems , such as biomolecules , provide critical information regarding structural intermediates ( transitions states ) and barrier heights .",
    "the search for these paths has a long history in the applied math research commnity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as in the field of biomolecular computation .",
    "many approaches must start from an initial guess for the reaction path ( such as a straight line between two states ) , effectively limiting the search to a single pathway . on the other hand ,",
    "`` targeted '' and `` steered '' md approaches are capable of finding multiple pathways by repeated simulation ( from differing initial conditions ) forced to reach the desired end state .",
    "the recently - introduced soft - ratcheting approach @xcite is also capable of `` blindly '' determining multiple reaction pathways .",
    "it differs from the targeted and steered approaches in the following ways : ( i ) monotonic progress toward the target state is not enforced , permitting a wider range of reaction pathways ; ( ii ) soft - ratcheting is applied in the context of stochastic dynamics , although this does not prevent the inclusion of explicit solvent molecules ; and ( iii ) a probability weight ( `` score '' ) is associated with each trajectory generated , which in principle also permits estmates of the reaction rates within the dynamic importance sampling ( dims ) formulation discussed by woolf @xcite and by zuckerman and woolf @xcite .",
    "we note that reaction - rate estimates have not yet been produced by the soft - ratcheting algorithm , because such estimates require trajectories sampled with a near - optimal distribution ( i.e. , as would occur in unbiased dynamics ; see below ) .",
    "the soft - ratcheting procedure is simple and is motivated by the metropolis algorithm @xcite and the `` exponential transformation '' used in nuclear importance sampling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "related methods include the  weighted - ensemble brownian dynamics \" approach of huber and kim @xcite and the `` contra md '' scheme of harvey and gabb @xcite .",
    "the process is : ( a ) generate an unbiased step ; ( b ) if the step moves toward the target state , accept it ; ( c ) if it moves away , accept it with a probability ( i.e. , `` softly '' ) that increases in the forward direction ; ( d ) repeat , while estimating the probability score for all accepted steps .",
    "we emphasize that the non - monotonicity embodied in ( b ) and ( c ) , and the existence of the score in ( d ) distinguish this method from previous multiple - pathway methods .",
    "the guiding concept behind soft - ratcheting is _ not _ to force the system ( which necessarily perturbs the dynamics ) but to try to allow the system to proceed in a possible , if unlikely , way .",
    "of course , rare stochastic events are just what we seek !    note too that , unlike the trajectory sampling methods introduced by pratt @xcite and pursued by chandler and coworkers as well as those of eastman , grnbech - jensen and doniach @xcite , the _ overall _ effect of the soft - ratcheting algorithm is non - metropolis in nature ( despite the motivation ) : _ trajectories do not evolve from one another and are statistically independent_. the metropolis idea is only used to ensure that a given trajectory successfully reaches the target state . in this important sense , the soft - ratcheting algorithm comes under the independent - trajectory rubric of the dims method .",
    "in essence there is no more theoretical underpinning to producing soft - ratcheted trajectories than that already sketched in the introduction : using a physically - but - arbitrarily chosen _ acceptance probability function _ for step increments , one accepts all forward steps , and backward steps are accepted with a probability which decreases the more `` negative '' the increment .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : p - accept ] . here",
    ", the forward direction is simply some vector in configuration space that points from the initial to the target state  perhaps a dihedral angle in a dihedral transition .",
    "the algorithm is sufficiently robust ( see results section ) that advance knowledge of the reaction path and the true reaction coordinate is not necessary .    when generating a series of soft - ratcheted crossing events in a single long trajectory , it is convenient to use a simple _ threshold _ device @xcite .",
    "this means only that trajectories are permitted to perform unbiased dynamics in small regions near the `` centers '' of the beginning and end states , and biased ( i.e. , soft - ratcheted ) dynamics begin only when the threshold is reached .",
    "the idea is to allow the trajectory to explore different parts of the stable states , with an eye toward finding exit points to different pathways .",
    "such exploration , of course , must take place within the limits of available computer time ! as noted below",
    ", our use of the threshold requires further investigation and optimization , though it appears to perform the task of permitting exploration of alternative exit points from a stable state .",
    "it is only when one wishes to associate a score with a trajectory that some analysis must be undertaken .",
    "the dynamic importance sampling ( dims ) approach requires the probability score for use in rate estimates , moreover .",
    "specifically , the probability score used in dims calculations is the ratio of two quantities : ( i ) the probability that the given trajectory would occur in an unbiased simulation  a known quantity ; and ( ii ) the probabilty that the given trajectory was produced in the biased ( e.g. , soft - ratcheting ) simulation .",
    "further details of the full dims formulation may be found in refs .   and are beyond the scope of the present report . here",
    "we focus solely on computing the probability that the soft - ratcheting algorithm produced a given trajectory ( ii ) , which unfortunately does not follow directly from the simple acceptance probability used to generate the trajectory .",
    "this section gives full details of generating the probability score ( i.e. , ratio ) required by dims .",
    "briefly , however , assume progress towards the target is measured in terms of a scalar `` distance , '' @xmath0 , which is larger at the target state than the initial : each step corresponds to an increment @xmath1 , with positive increments moving toward the target . from any starting configuration @xmath2 , one can define the _ unbiased _ distribution of @xmath1 increments @xmath3 , which is simply the projection of the more fundamental distribution of configurations , @xmath4 , onto the @xmath1 coordinate .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 increments typically is nearly gaussian with a mean which may be either positive or negative .",
    "however , once certain backward steps are rejected due to the acceptance function in the soft - ratcheting procedure ( specified below ) , the @xmath1 distribution is shifted forward in a non - trivial way to become the biased distribution , @xmath5 . estimating the ratio of values of these two distributions for every accepted step ( though not the entire distributions ) is the task at hand .",
    "the multi - dimensional case reduces to a simple scalar description in terms of @xmath1 increments , but we include it for completeness .",
    "we assume ( although it is not necessary for the formalism ) that the initial and final states of interest in our molecule do not require the full all - atom configuration @xmath6 , but rather a subset of coordinates , say , @xmath7 . if the target point is the `` center '' of state b , say , @xmath8 , then one can always measure the distance to that point , @xmath9^{1/2 } \\;,\\ ] ] where it may be necessary to consider the closest distance if the @xmath10 coordinates represent true angles . for a step from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , one can then define a one - dimensional change in distance by @xmath11 in essence , since distance from the target is always a scalar quantity , one need only consider a one - dimensional description to estimate probability scores .",
    "the acceptance function for @xmath1 increments is very simple and is specified by the simulator .",
    "the function used in the present work is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - accept ] and is written @xmath12 } & \\mbox{if } { \\delta \\varphi } < 0 \\ ; ,    \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a parameter which controls the width of the ( backwards ) decay depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - accept ] .",
    "the gradual decay to zero is the `` softness '' of soft - ratcheting : many backwards steps will be accepted .    with @xmath14 specified",
    ", the final task toward generating the required probability score is to consider the relation between the unbiased and soft - ratcheted ( biased ) distribution .",
    "the probability ( density ) that the soft - ratcheting algorithm will generate a given @xmath0 increment , @xmath15 , is proportional to the product of the unbiased probability of generating the increment , @xmath16 , and the acceptance probability , @xmath14 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the required normalization factor , given by the fraction of steps initiated at @xmath2 which would be accepted by the soft - ratcheting procedure .",
    "as noted , the biased distribution , @xmath15 , has been shifted forward in the @xmath0 direction because the acceptance function @xmath14 partially suppresses backward steps .",
    "the desired probability score for a single step is then the ratio deriving from ( [ single - step - prob ] ) , namely , @xmath19 to truly calculate the normalization factor @xmath20 , one would have to initiate a large number of steps from the point @xmath2 and compute the fraction accepted by the soft - ratcheting acceptance function .",
    "as that procedure would be very computationally expensive , we instead use the sequence of nearby _ attempted _ steps , both accepted and rejected , to estimate the probability that soft - ratcheted steps were accepted in a given local region of configuration space .",
    "the final score is simply the product of the single - step scores ( [ single - step - ratio ] ) .",
    "the results of this preliminary report may be summarized in three points : ( i ) the soft - ratcheting algorithm is capable of generating reaction pathways _ rapidly _  in a fraction of the time which would be required by unbiased simulation : see fig .  [",
    "fig : short - time ] ; ( ii ) the scores associated with each crossing trajectory permit the generation of a most - important _ ensemble _ of events as in fig .",
    "[ fig : long - time ] , which can give more detailed information about the full `` valley '' of the pathway ; and ( iii ) the associated scores , in principle , permit _ rate estimates _ within the dynamic importance sampling formulation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : short - time ] , one sees the rapidity with which the soft - ratcheting algorithm generates crossing trajectories .",
    "the same three pathways are found in 1/70th of the simulation time . in absolute terms , the 10 nsec .  of simulation time used in generating the soft - ratcheting trajectories appears quite long ; however , this time may be significantly reduced by adjusting the threshold level ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) from the preliminary value used to generate the depicted results .",
    "figure [ fig : long - time ] illustrates the capacity of the soft - ratcheting algorithm to generate an `` important '' ( highly weighted ) ensemble of crossing events .",
    "the large set of trajectories shown in the figure clearly gives a better description of the pathway valleys than the sparse events generated by unbiased simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : long - time ] also demonstrates the agreement between the weight estimate discussed previously ( used to select the depicted trajectories ) and the unbiased results .",
    "the higher - weighted trajectories coincide strongly with the unbiased events . the large cluster of soft - ratcheted trajectories in the region @xmath21 deserves comment . because there is only a single unbiased event in that region , it is not obvious whether the relatively widely dispersed soft - ratcheted trajectories are `` correct ''",
    " i.e. , whether such an ensemble of trajectories would be found in a long unbiased simulation , with many events in the region .",
    "examination of the adiabatic energy surface ( not shown ) does indicate that the channel in question is indeed significantly wider than the two pathways crossing @xmath22 , though perhaps not quite to the extent suggested by the soft - ratcheting trajectories of fig .",
    "[ fig : long - time ] .",
    "several means of improving the soft - ratcheting procedure are possible , of which we mention two .",
    "first , to increase the speed with which transition trajectories are generated  really , to decrease the waiting interval between crossing events  one can reduce the size of the threshold region ( sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] ) in which purely _ unbiased _ dynamics are performed .",
    "the threshold region was intended to permit trajectories to explore a multiplicity of potential `` exit points '' from the stable state .",
    "however , the `` softness '' of the soft - ratcheting algorithm should , by itself , permit a substantial degree of this kind of exploration , and it may be possible to use a very small threshold region .",
    "second , a more optimal ( i.e. , higher - scoring ) ensemble of trajectories presumably can be obtained by systematic estimation of parameter @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the promising preliminary results presented in sec .  [ sec : results ] were based on an _ ad - hoc _ choice .",
    "it is a simple matter to study in more detail an unbiased distribution of @xmath1 increments , and then use this data to systematically inform the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , one can imagine attempting to bias trajectories forward in a focussed conical region of dihedral angles @xcite , rather than simply according to ( hyper)planes of constant @xmath1 .",
    "ultimately , it will also be important to compare the soft - ratcheted paths ( which presumably represent the stochastic dynamics in a faithul way ) with those generated by explicitly - solvated molecular dyanmics simulation .",
    "that is , how does the addition of explicit solvent alter the paths ?",
    "of course , this comparison will only be possible in small molecules like the alanine dipeptide and other small peptides , but it will provide a crucial validation of the technique .",
    "we have given motivation and details for the `` soft - ratcheting '' algorithm @xcite for determining reaction pathways in molecular systems governed by stochastic dynamics .",
    "the method generates independent transition trajectories which will not be trapped in a single channel ( pathway ) , and hence is capable of finding multiple channels .",
    "although a final state is always targeted on average , the algorithm permits `` backward '' steps with a suppressed probability .",
    "the trajectories are thus ratcheted forward , but only softly : see fig .",
    "[ fig : p - accept ] .",
    "the capacities of the approach were demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : short - time ] and [ fig : long - time ] for an all - atom model of the alanine dipeptide molecule evolving according to overdamped langevin dynamics with the amber potential @xcite .    beyond rapidly generating multiple pathways , as other existing approaches are presently able to do",
    ", the soft - ratcheting algorithm has the potential also to estimate reaction rates and free energy differences via the dynamic importance sampling ( dims ) framework . the soft - ratcheting algorithm associates a score ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] ) with each transition trajectory it generates .",
    "the scores , in turn , may be used in principle to estimate kinetics and free energy differences . at present",
    ", however , we note that initial results showed that further parameterization and/or refinement of the algorithm are necessary before efficiency can be obtained in rate and free energy calculations .",
