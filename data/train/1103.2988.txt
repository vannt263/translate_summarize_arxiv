    "the relationship between the radio and x - ray emission in black - hole binaries has been extensively studied , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the qualitative form of the radio / x - ray correlation in cyg x-1 is rather typical of black - hole binaries . in the hard spectral state",
    ", there is a positive correlation , as in other black - hole binaries @xcite . at transitions to the soft state of cyg",
    "x-1 , the radio flux strongly decreases .",
    "this is also similar to other black - hole binaries . in particular",
    ", the radio flux strongly declines at the transition from the hard state to a soft one in gx 3394 @xcite , xte j1650500 @xcite , and xte j1859 + 226 @xcite .",
    "after the soft - state decline , the radio flux from black - hole transients may strongly increase in an intermittent manner , sometimes up to the overall maximum for a source , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , which is probably due to the ejection of radio - emitting blobs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar overall radio - soft x - ray correlation with all of the above states is also seen in cyg x-3 @xcite , which , based on its x - ray properties @xcite , is probably a black - hole binary .",
    "the soft - state radio flaring is not seen in cyg x-1 , apparently due to the limited range of its x - ray flux .",
    "determining the relationship between the radio and x - ray emission is of major importance to our understanding of the physics of accretion and outflow in black - hole binaries .",
    "the bulk of the radio emission is clearly from the jet .",
    "there are two possible origins of the correlation of the radio emission with x - rays in black - hole binaries .",
    "one is that the level of x - ray emission in the hard spectral state , related to the accretion rate , is in turn related to the rate of the outflow forming the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another is that the x - ray emission of black - hole binaries is dominated by emission of the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the usual approach to studying the radio / x - ray correlation is to consider the hard spectral state only and to study the x - ray emission in a relatively narrow band , typically 210 kev or 39 kev .",
    "the relation with the radio flux is represented by a power law ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical consequences of the value of the power - law index are then are considered ( e.g. , @xcite ) . sometimes infrared or optical emission is also considered in addition to radio ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a common implicit assumption is that the correlation is the same in other x - ray bands as in the band considered .",
    "attention is rarely paid to the correlation of the radio flux with the bolometric flux ( dominated by the x - rays ) , a quantity which is crucial for the first class of models listed above . here",
    ", we consider the correlation of the radio emission with x - rays in several energy bands in the case of the archetypical and well studied black - hole binary cyg x-1 .",
    "we consider all its spectral states , from hard to soft .",
    "we first study the x - ray spectral variability patterns , in particular the dependence of the bolometric flux on the x - ray spectral slope , as well as on the fluxes in various x - ray bands .",
    "we calculate the spectra and bolometric fluxes averaged over a 1-day time scale using the monitoring by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; @xcite ) simultaneous with the monitoring either by the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) or by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; @xcite ) on board of _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) .",
    "the discovery of substantial orbital modulation of the radio emission @xcite shows that free - free absorption in the stellar wind @xcite of the donor affects the observed radio emission and so complicates the interpretation of the observations .",
    "the level of attenuation of the intrinsic radio flux depends on the height along the jet where the bulk of the emission at a given frequency emerges @xcite , which is difficult to determine . in spite of this complication , given its importance and brightness and the wealth of available monitoring data , the study of cyg x-1 source provides valuable insights into the relationship between the radio and x - ray emission in black - hole binaries .",
    "we use monitoring data from the _ rxte_/asm , which has three channels at energies of 1.53 kev , 35 kev and 512 kev .",
    "the _ cgro_/batse monitoring data used here are the same as those in @xcite , hereafter z02 , which were obtained using the earth occultation analysis technique @xcite .",
    "they are given as energy fluxes in the 20100 kev and 100300 kev channels .",
    "swift_/bat , we use 14195 kev 8-channel light curves created for this work .",
    "the channels are between energies of 14 , 20 , 24 , 35 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 and 195 kev . the data used here from the asm , batse and bat are for mjd 5008755700 , 5008751686 and 5335555469 , respectively . fig .",

    "the 312 kev energy range in cyg x-1 is only weakly affected by absorption and is thus a good measure of the actual spectral slope in that range .",
    "we consider separately data with @xmath6 ( hard state ) , @xmath7 ( intermediate state ) and @xmath8 ( soft state ) .",
    "these boundaries differ slightly from those used in z02 ; here , in particular , our definition of the hard state is more stringent and more suitable for studies of the correlation with the radio emission .",
    "we take @xmath9 , 2.1 and 2.5 as the average indices of the three respective groups .",
    "we stress that the soft state in cyg x-1 usually contains a high energy tail much stronger than that typical of low - mass black - hole binaries in the soft state . in those binaries ,",
    "the tail often virtually disappears ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as the radio emission being strongly quenched ( unlike the case in cyg x-1 ) .",
    "thus the soft state of cyg x-1 might also be called ` soft intermediate ' in the context of low - mass black - hole binaries .",
    "we use 15-ghz data from the ryle telescope and the ami large array .",
    "the ami large array is the re - built and reconfigured ryle telescope .",
    "the monitoring by the ryle telescope was carried out during mjd 5022653902 , and the ami monitoring of cyg x-1 started on mjd 54573 , the data used here being until mjd 55540 .",
    "the new correlator has a useful bandwidth of about 4 ghz ( compared with 0.35 ghz ) ; but the effective centre frequency is similar , and in any case the radio spectrum of cyg x-1 , at least in the hard state , is known to be very flat @xcite .",
    "the data are subject to variations in the flux calibration of about 10 per cent from one day to another .",
    "we also use the 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz monitoring data from the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) . according to the web page description ,",
    "the data are error - dominated below 15 mjy .",
    "however , we have found that using only the data @xmath10 mjy with the x - ray fluxes introduces a bias , making the resulting radio / x - ray distributions artificially flat .",
    "in fact , the values of the spearman s correlation coefficients increase and the associated null hypothesis probabilities decrease when we decrease @xmath11 ( i.e. , include more low - flux data ) . after studying different choices ,",
    "we have opted for using the data @xmath12 mjy for fits .",

    "both have been renormalized to the average count rate / flux over the long hard state of mjd 5388055375 ( discussed in detail by zps11 ) .",
    "we see that the radio and the 1.512 kev x - ray fluxes closely follow each other during hard / low x - ray states but the radio emission is suppressed during the soft / high x - ray states .",

    "one of our findings is the strong dependence of the radio / x - ray correlation index on the energy band , see table [ t : fit ] and fig .",
    "[ f : index ] .",
    "the energy - dependence of the correlation can be understood as an intrinsic dependence of the radio flux on the bolometric flux combined with flux - dependent changes in the spectral shape ( seen in our data at @xmath76 kev and @xmath77 kev ) .",
    "the latter leads to the bolometric flux and that in a narrow x - ray band being non - proportional in a way that depends on the band chosen .",
    "this dependence has mostly been ignored in previous work on this subject except , e.g. , @xcite , where its effect has been accounted for by a theoretical model , @xcite , who fitted the radio correlation with @xmath14 in gx 3394 , obtaining @xmath78 , and @xcite , who calculated the correlation in gx 3394 in four separate bands between 3 kev and 200 kev , but have not calculated the correlation index for @xmath14 .    in models",
    "in which the accretion rate , @xmath62 , governs both the accretion flow and the jet ( see section [ accretion ] below ) , it is crucial to determine its value .",
    "it is related to the bolometric flux by , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the source distance , and @xmath81 is the accretion radiative efficiency .",
    "our results indicate that the jet power is a fraction not of the total accretion power but only of that responsible for emission associated with hot electrons in the accretion flow , @xmath30 . in this case we should write @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the efficiency of producing the hot flow . however , the difference between the two is negligible in the hard state , where the hot flow is energetically dominant .",
    "the common procedure has been to use a narrow band , such as 39 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as the proxy for @xmath14 , i.e. implicitly assuming @xmath84 , and then proceed to theoretical interpretation . however , we have shown that this can lead to significant errors . for our data , we can estimate the 39 kev flux as the sum of the 35 kev flux and a fraction of the 512 kev flux , the fraction being determined assuming a power law with the 312 kev photon index . using the flux in this band , we find @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , for 2.25 ghz , 8.3 ghz , and 15 ghz , respectively . comparing with table [ t : fit ]",
    ", we see that the 39 kev values of @xmath36 are smaller than those for @xmath88 by @xmath890.3 . this problem occurs for any system with spectral variability , which is generally the case in either black - hole or neutron - star x - ray binaries .",
    "our next main finding is that we are able to extend the correlation to the intermediate and soft states .",
    "the radio emission has been known to correlate in the soft states of some objects with the level of the high - energy tail , e.g. , in cyg x-3 @xcite ; however , that dependence was different from that in the hard state .",
    "here , we find that if we consider , instead of the bolometric flux , that in the emission in the hot plasma only ( i.e. , @xmath14 minus the disc blackbody component ) , we obtain a single radio / x - ray power law correlation going through all the states .",
    "its index , @xmath90 , is consistent within uncertainties with the correlation index for @xmath14 ( for the asm+bat data ) in the hard state only , @xmath91 .",
    "this appears to indicate that the jet is launched from the hot electrons responsible for the observed x - ray emission rather than by the optically - thick disc , and that the launching mechanism may be similar in the hard spectral state and in the soft one .",
    "we stress that cyg x-1 appears to always have some level of the high energy tail in the soft state , and consequently has often relatively strong radio emission in that state , as also found by @xcite .",
    "this is unlike low - mass black - hole systems , which often go to an extended soft state in which the tail virtually disappears ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and where consequently there is virtually no radio emission .",
    "also , cyg x-1 does not show the very high state , where ejection of radio - emitting blobs occurs instead of a jet , and where the launching mechanism is likely to be different .",
    "no such blob ejections have indeed been found during the 2010 state transition by @xcite .",
    "we have also found that the maximum of the radio emission occurs for relatively soft x - ray spectra , with @xmath13@xmath922.1 .",
    "thus , the transition to the soft state is first associated with an increase of the radio emission and only then with a decrease .          to 0.5 cm      radio emission of cyg x-1 from 2.25 ghz to 15 ghz is known to exhibit orbital modulation due to free - free absorption in the stellar wind of the companion @xcite .",
    "the full modulation depth changes from @xmath244 per cent at 2.25 ghz to 30 per cent at 15 ghz @xcite .",
    "thus , free - free absorption certainly affects the observed radio fluxes .",
    "however , it is not trivial to determine the degree of the attenuation , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the orbit - averaged optical depth . using an estimate of the mass loss rate from the companion towards the polar regions ( where the jet radio emission is absorbed ) and of the inclination , and calculating the temperature of the wind irradiated both by the star and the x - ray source",
    ", we can use the strength of the observed orbital modulation to calculate the height along the jet , @xmath95 , from which the bulk of the radio emission at a given frequency is received @xcite .",
    "this height corresponds to the place above which the jet becomes optically thin to synchrotron self - absorption @xcite .",
    "based on the value of @xmath95 , we can calculate the optical depth , @xmath94 , through the wind , provided its density and temperature profile are known .",
    "given that a radio flux , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where @xmath25 is now either the flux in an x - ray band , the bolometric flux or the flux emitted by hot electrons , an index , @xmath36 , derived from the observations is related to the corresponding intrinsic index , @xmath98 , by @xmath99 generally , we expect the jet power to positively correlate with the height along the jet where the emission becomes optically thin to synchrotron self - absorption",
    ". thus @xmath100 should be anti - correlated with the depth within the stellar wind , given by @xmath101 , which then implies @xmath102 .",
    "consequently , the effect of free - free absorption of the radio fluxes is to increase their observed variability range with respect to the intrinsic range , and to make the radio / x - ray correlation steeper .",
    "this effect has been suggested to qualitatively explain the relative steepness of the correlation in cyg x-1 by @xcite .",
    "a quantitative investigation of this effect has been made by @xcite , where it was found that the depth of the orbital radio modulation at 15 ghz ( related to @xmath101 ) indeed significantly anti - correlates with @xmath100 .",
    "this can yield the factor @xmath103 of equation ( [ index ] ) , provided the wind parameters are specified . here , an important factor is the weakness of the polar component of the wind of cyg x-1 recently found by @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xcite found values of @xmath94 significantly lower than those obtained by @xcite , who assumed the wind is isotropic .",
    "the best resulting estimate of @xmath103 is @xmath240.8 at 15 ghz , which yields @xmath104 for the correlation with the bolometric flux estimated based on the asm+bat data .",
    "that estimate also implies that the wind attenuation of the 15 ghz flux is rather small , which is consistent with the observed 2220 ghz spectrum ( shown also in fig .",
    "[ f : sprx ] ) being relatively straight with @xmath105 , and not showing deviations from that power law by more a factor of @xmath242 .",
    "also , the relative mildness of the wind attenuation is consistent with the orbital modulation at 89 ghz , 146 ghz and 221 ghz not being reported by @xcite .",
    "we caution , however , that the theoretical model of @xcite is a subject to uncertainties due to the uncertain wind density in polar regions .    in order to show the cyg x-1 hard - state correlation in the context of other sources ,",
    "we have compared it to those of the black - hole binaries h1743322 , gx 3394 and v404 cyg , see fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the 39 kev fluxes as described in section [ range ] above . to obtain the luminosities ,",
    "we have assumed isotropy and a distance to cyg x-1 of @xmath106 kpc , a value is in the middle of the range of about 1.82.2 kpc of @xcite , and consistent with the 1.52 kpc range found by @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : correlation ] .",
    "( changing @xmath80 would move the cyg x-1 points diagonally . )",
    "we see that the cyg x-1 dependence at 15 ghz is only slightly steeper than @xmath107 found for h1743322 .",
    "the cyg x-1 correlation slope for 39 kev is @xmath108 ( section [ range ] ) .",
    "given the above , relatively minor , correction to the correlation slope for free - free absorption of @xmath109 , we deduce @xmath110 for 39 kev . the 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz data",
    "are more uncertain but suggest a similar slope .",
    "thus , cyg x-1 appears to be intrinsically similar to h1743322 , rather than to the standard binaries showing the radio / x - ray correlation , gx 3394 and v404 cyg , with @xmath111 .",
    "we also note that the normalizations of the 2.25 ghz , 8.3 ghz and 15 ghz flux distributions are very similar , which is not compatible with the 15 ghz data being strongly affected by attenuation and again suggests that the correction due to free - free absorption is relatively low .",
    "@xcite gives an extensive discussion of theoretical models that could explain @xmath112 , and we refer the reader there for details . assuming a scale - free jet , @xcite have obtained the following scaling between the jet power , @xmath113 , and the flux at a given radio frequency ( below the turnover @xmath114 ) , @xmath115 here , @xmath116 is the index of the power - law relativistic electron distribution , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the lorentz factor , with typical values of @xmath1193 ( from observations of optically - thin parts of synchrotron spectra ) . for cyg x-1",

    ", @xmath81 is a constant , @xmath126 , in fully efficient accretion flows , and thus @xmath127 .",
    "this scaling connects the radio flux to the bolometric one , @xmath128 thus , @xmath129 , implying @xmath130 for sources with radiatively efficient accretion flows , and @xmath131 for sources with advective accretion flows .",
    "our results of section [ free - free ] indicate that @xmath132 or so through all the states of cyg x-1 ( although with with caveats due to the effect of wind absorption being not fully known ) , and thus its accretion flow appears to be efficient . in the hard state , this conclusion supports the same finding of @xcite but based on the difference in the efficiency between the average hard state and the soft state in cyg x-1 being small . in this state ,",
    "a likely model is a luminous hot accretion flow @xcite .    in the soft state , the hot electrons most likely form a corona above a disc , which corona",
    "is radiatively efficient , being cooled by the disc blackbody photons .",
    "then , @xmath127 and we expect the same correlation index in the soft state for the hot electron emission ( @xmath30 ) as in the hard state provided the power supplied to the corona is a constant fraction of the accretion power .",
    "[ f : hot_bol ] shows that this is indeed the case , with at most a weak dependence , and the fraction equals @xmath241/4 .",
    "both the constancy and the fractional value are consistent with theoretical expectations for the gas - pressure dominated disc @xcite .",
    "this is also in agreement with the finding that the disc in cyg x-1 is in the gas - pressure dominance regime @xcite .",
    "then , the fact that the radio / x - ray correlation extends , with about the same @xmath36 , from the hard state to the soft one ( for @xmath30 ) , represents then another argument for the high accretion efficiency in the hard state cyg x-1 .",
    "an alternative to the accretion flow model as an explanation of the radio / x - ray correlation is that both radio and x - rays are emitted by the jet . in particular ,",
    "both could be emitted by the synchrotron emission of the same population of non - thermal electrons , with the radio and x - rays from the optically thick and thin parts , respectively .",
    "for this case , @xcite have derived , @xmath133 which yields @xmath1340.7 for @xmath1353 .",
    "thus , this model would have required @xmath1360.8 , and a large correction to @xmath36 due to free - free absorption , which is in conflict with our results in section [ free - free ]",
    ".    moreover , fig .",
    "[ f : sprx ] shows that the normalization of the x - ray emission in the hard state is too high by a factor of @xmath2430 for the x - rays to be due to optically thin non - thermal synchrotron emission above the turnover frequency , which is @xmath30.1 ev in cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes even worse for the intermediate state ( in which the radio emission peaks ) , where the disagreement in the normalization at 0.1 ev is by three orders of magnitude . as discussed in section",
    "[ free - free ] , the effect of free - free absorption on the average 2220 ghz spectrum can be at most a factor of @xmath242 , which can not explain this discrepancy .",
    "this rules out non - thermal synchrotron as the origin of the x - rays .",
    "this has also been independently found by @xcite .",
    "we note that another ground for ruling out this model for luminous hard state of black - hole binaries is that it does not reproduce the shape of the high - energy cut - off , and it has problems reproducing the narrow distribution of the observed cut - off energies @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite found the x - ray spectra of the black - hole binary xte j1550564 to be dominated by thermal comptonization in its luminous hard states , at @xmath137 .",

    "thus , our findings above are consistent with those of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra of xte j1550564 were found to be dominated by jet non - thermal synchrotron emission at lower luminosities . a weak jet contribution ,",
    "not detectable in our x - ray data , remains also possible in cyg x-1 , given the relative normalization of the radio power law and that of the x - rays , see fig .",
    "[ f : sprx ] .",
    "x - ray jet models for luminous states of black - hole binaries , and for cyg x-1 in particular , have been also ruled out on several other grounds by @xcite . in particular , they discuss the model of @xcite , in which the x - rays in the hard state of cyg x-1 ( and other black - hole binaries ) are due to synchrotron - self - compton by thermal electrons with @xmath1405 mev of a very low thomson optical depth at the jet base .",
    "@xcite find that the parameters fitted by @xcite strongly violate the e@xmath141 pair equilibrium , with the self - consistent optical depth being two orders of magnitude higher than the fitted one due to the produced pairs .",

    "other problems with the x - ray jet models are discussed by @xcite ( effect of electron energy loss on optically - thin synchrotron spectra ) and by @xcite ( comparison of black - hole and neutron - star sources ) .",
    "a number of papers have also attributed the high - energy tail observed in the soft state of x - ray binaries to optically thin non - thermal synchrotron or self - compton emission from the jet , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note that for the soft state in cyg x-1 , the extrapolation of the high - energy tail down to 1 ev is a few orders of magnitude above any possible extrapolation of the radio emission in that state .",
    "this rules out this model .",
    "in addition , it requires that the actual bolometric luminosity of the modelled sources is a few orders of magnitude above the ones determined based on the x - rays , as well as that the emission is unbeamed , which appear highly unlikely . instead",

    "we have studied x - ray variability patterns of cyg x-1 . in the hard state ,",

    "the correlation indices in the hard state vary from @xmath48 to @xmath145 across the x - ray energy band .",

    "this indicates that the radio jet is formed by the hot comptonizing electrons in the accretion flow , and not by the blackbody disc .",

    "we see that the first three flares took place during time intervals during which cyg x-1 was in the intermediate spectral state , with @xmath13@xmath1552.2 , though the first flare itself corresponded to a transient return to the hard state , with a hardening up to @xmath13@xmath1561.7 .",

    "in particular in the hard state , other pointed spectra are substantially softer in the asm energy range , see , e.g. , fig .  13 in z02 , which explains this minor discrepancy .    for the soft state",
    ", we show the _ bepposax _ and _ cgro _ model spectrum from 1996 june , fitted with hybrid comptonization @xcite .",
    "we see relatively good agreement with our average spectra , especially with the asm+bat data at @xmath162 kev .",
    "we see some disagreement in the 1.53 kev channel for the asm+bat spectrum , and in the normalization of the 20300 kev channels for the asm+batse spectrum . as in the hard state ,",
    "this is due to the difference between observing for a short time in a given state and averaging over all data with @xmath1312 kev ) within a given range .",

    "we assume @xmath166 @xmath19 , which is the average @xmath167 for the pointed observations of cyg x-1 studied by @xcite ( using their model 0 ) , and assume the three values of @xmath165 .",
    "we approximate the contribution from @xmath168 kev by assuming that the intrinsic ( i.e. , corrected for absorption ) spectrum in the 1.53 kev range continues down as a power law with the values of @xmath165 down to 0.2 kev for the hard state and to 0.4 kev for the other states , which limiting values of energy we estimated from fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "the corrections for emission below 1.5 kev appear most uncertain for soft states ( where the dominant part of the spectrum appears to be a disc blackbody ) . on the other hand",
    "the disc blackbody is weak and furthermore the contribution from @xmath168 kev to the bolometric flux is minor in the hard state , implying that our estimates of @xmath14 in this state are reasonably accurate .",
    "the contributions from energies above the range of bat and batse are estimated using the shape of the _ bepposax _ hard - state spectrum .",
    "we find that @xmath169@xmath170 ( which is only @xmath142 per cent of @xmath14 ) and @xmath171@xmath172 ( @xmath173 per cent of @xmath14 ) .",
    "these estimates are valid for the hard state , in which the spectra fall off exponentially at high energies . in soft states ,",
    "the spectra continue at high energies as power laws ( see , e.g. , fig .  13 in z02 )",
    ", so the correction factors would be higher . however , most of the contribution in the soft state is from soft x - rays , so that the underestimate is negligible .",
    "we note that in order to calculate @xmath14 we could have alternatively fitted the asm and either bat or batse data with some models including absorption .",
    "this would be more accurate but would have presented a number of additional problems .",
    "whereas we can use the relatively simple thermal comptonization in the hard state , a non - thermal electron component is required in the intermediate and soft states ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which would add a few free parameters .",
    "the fitting would have to be performed for as many as the @xmath243000 daily spectra .",

    "the logarithms of @xmath175 and @xmath25 are fitted . in the case of radio / x - ray correlations",

    "the fit parameters are given in table [ t : fit ] .",
    "we encounter here an important issue of the uncertainties on the fitted parameters , @xmath177 and @xmath36 .",
    "the probability calculated by this method assumes that the spread of the points is solely due to measurement errors whereas it is , as usually the case in astrophysics , due to both the intrinsic variability and the measurement errors .",
    "if only the errors are included , the fit probabilities are very close to null , which renders invalid the estimates on the fit uncertainties .",
    "therefore , we assume fractional uncertainties , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , on all the measurements such that the fit probability becomes @xmath30.5 , or equivalently , @xmath181 .",
    "this takes into account the actual spread of the data points due to intrinsic variability . the ratio between the errors in the @xmath182 and @xmath183 directions is taken to be the ratio of the observed spread of the points , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the standard deviation ( in the log space ) of the @xmath182 or @xmath183 points , respectively . since the measurement errors are typically much smaller than the spread of the points we neglect them and include only the errors as above .",
    "( this method is similar to that used in @xcite except that they assumed @xmath186 . ) under our assumptions , the best fit index corresponds to the slope of the covariance ellipse , @xmath187 .",
    "the best - fit parameter values depend only weakly on @xmath188 as long as their ratio is fixed as above .",
    "the fractional errors required for @xmath181 are in general @xmath189 except for fits involving the 150195 kev energy band , where they are required to be slightly larger .    for tight correlations , such as between the x - ray flux in a given energy band ,",
    "the fitted values of @xmath36 weakly depend on the @xmath190 ratio , and they are almost the same if , e.g. , @xmath186 were assumed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spread is large , as in the radio / x - ray correlations , the fitted values depend sensitively on the adopted @xmath190 . however , our method above does reproduce the actual slope of the dependence , under the assumption that it is linear in the log space and that all points have equal relative weight ."
