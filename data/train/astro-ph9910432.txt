    "galaxies with wolf - rayet ( wr ) star features in their spectra have long been known , beginning with the discovery of such features in the spectrum of the blue compact galaxy he 2 - 10 by allen , wright & goss ( 1976 ) .",
    "osterbrock & cohen ( 1982 ) and conti ( 1991 ) introduced the concept of wr galaxies , defining them to be those galaxies which show broad stellar emission lines in their spectra .",
    "these wr galaxies are thought to be undergoing present or very recent star formation which produces massive stars evolving to the wr stage .",
    "wr galaxies are therefore ideal objects for studying the early phases of starbursts , determining burst properties and constraining parameters of the high mass end of the initial mass function .    more than 130 wr galaxies are now known ( conti 1999 ; schaerer , contini & pindao 1999b ) .",
    "morphologically , they constitute a very inhomogeneous class , including such diverse objects as galaxies with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , ultraluminous far - infrared galaxies , spiral galaxies , starbursts and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies .",
    "individual wr stars can not be usually observed as single stars in distant galaxies . they have been observed only in our galaxy ( massey & conti 1980 ; torres & conti 1984 ; hamman , koesterke & wessolowski 1995 ; koesterke & hamann 1995 ; esteban & peimbert 1995 ; crowther , smith & hillier 1995b ; crowther et al .",
    "1995c ; crowther , smith & willis 1995d ; crowther & bohannan 1997 ) , in the magellanic clouds ( moffat et al . 1987 ; conti & massey 1989 ; bohannan & walborn 1989 ; smith , shara & moffat 1990a ; russell & dopita 1990 ; crowther , hillier & smith 1995a ; crowther & smith 1997 ; crowther & dessart 1998 ) and in some members of the local group : m31 and m33 ( conti & massey 1981 ; dodorico & rosa 1981 ; massey & conti 1983 ; massey , conti & armandroff 1987 ; schild , smith & willis 1990 ; willis , schild & smith 1992 ; smith , crowther & willis 1995 ; crowther et al . 1997 ; massey & johnson 1998 ) , ic 10 ( massey , armandroff & conti 1992 ) , ngc 6822 , ic 1613 , ngc 300 , and ngc 55 ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "much effort has been expended recently to construct a reliable quantitative scheme for classifying wr stars , based on observations of these stars in our galaxy and in the nearest galaxies , mainly the lmc . as a result , a quantitative classification of wn , wc and wo stars has been elaborated ( smith , shara & moffat 1990ab , 1996 ; smith & maeder 1991 ; kingsburgh , barlow & storey 1995 ; crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) .",
    "additionally , evolutionary synthesis models for young starbursts have been developed with the use of the latest stellar evolution models , theoretical stellar spectra and compilation of observed emission line strengths from wr stars ( krger et al .",
    "1992 ; cervio & mas - hesse 1994 ; meynet 1995 ; schaerer & vacca 1998 , hereafter sv98 ) .",
    "wr stars in more distant objects are detected indirectly by observing integrated galaxy spectra .",
    "strong star formation activity in a galaxy results in a large number of massive stars , the most massive of which will evolve through the wr phase .",
    "thus , at a definite stage of the starburst evolution , many wr stars make their appearance during a short time interval . despite their small number relative to that of massive stars , especially in low - metallicity galaxies , wr stars",
    "are numerous enough for their integrated emission to be detected . in this paper , we shall follow osterbrock & cohen ( 1982 ) and conti ( 1991 ) in defining a wr galaxy as one whose integrated spectrum of the whole or a part shows detectable wr broad features emitted by unresolved star clusters .",
    "while this definition is dependent on the quality of the spectrum and the location and size of the aperture , it has the advantage of distinguishing a distant wr galaxy from nearby galaxies , where wr stars can be studied individually .",
    "the ratio of the number of wr stars to that of all massive stars is a very strong function of metallicity . theoretical evolutionary models ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991 ; maeder 1991 ; krger et al .",
    "1992 ; cervio & mas - hesse 1994 ; maeder & meynet 1994 ; meynet 1995 ; sv98 ) predict that for a fixed metallicity , this ratio varies strongly with time elapsed since the beginning of the starburst .",
    "its maximum value decreases from 1 to 0.02 when the heavy element mass fraction @xmath6 decreases from @xmath0 to @xmath0/50",
    ". the duration of the wr stage in the starburst also decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "hence the number of galaxies with extremely low metallicities containing a wr stellar population is expected to be very small .    a systematic search for wr features in emission - line galaxies",
    "was first carried out by kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) .",
    "they examined 45 extragalactic h ii regions and found 17 wr galaxies , based on the detection in their spectra of a broad emission excess in the @xmath146004700 wavelength region .",
    "conti ( 1991 ) compiled from the literature a first catalog containing 37 wr galaxies .",
    "vacca & conti ( 1992 ) performed a search for wr stars in a sample of 14 emission - line galaxies and developed a quantitative scheme for estimating wr populations .",
    "all these searches resulted in the detection of wr features in the blue region of the spectrum at @xmath14650 ( hereafter called the `` blue bump '' ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the first wr galaxy observed , he 2 - 10 , allen et al .",
    "( 1976 ) detected not only the blue bump , but also a broad n iii feature at @xmath145114535 . in subsequent studies of wr galaxies",
    "this feature was not generally seen or discussed .",
    "an exception is the most metal - deficient wr galaxy known , i zw 18 , where izotov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also identified the n iii @xmath145114535 feature .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models predict a significant number of wc4 stars which radiate strong broad c iii / c iv @xmath14650 and c iv @xmath15808 features ( schaerer & vacca 1996 ; schaerer et al .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) is @xmath7 1 in the solar neighborhood ( conti & vacca 1990 ) , and @xmath7 0.10.2 within a 10@xmath8 radius of the 30 doradus nebula ( moffat et al .",
    "1987 ) . in starbursting galaxies with 1/5",
    "@xmath9 @xmath6/@xmath0 @xmath9 1 @xmath7 30% of wr stars are of wc subtype ( schaerer & vacca 1996 ; schaerer et al .",
    "the first detections of the c iv @xmath15808 emission line ( hereafter called the `` red bump '' ) in integrated galaxy spectra were reported by kunth & schild ( 1986 ) and dinerstein & shields ( 1986 ) . however , the red bump was not seen in other early observations ( gonzalez - riestra , rego & zamorano 1987 ; vacca & conti 1992 ) . later higher signal - to - noise ratio observations allowed to detect the red wc bump ( civ @xmath1 5808 ) in an increasing number of galaxies ( izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1994 , 1997 , hereafter itl94 and itl97 ; izotov et al .",

    "1997 ; legrand et al .",
    "1997 ; de mello et al .",
    "hence , we have now at our disposal wr galaxies with metallicities ranging over two orders of magnitude , from @xmath0/50 to @xmath7 2@xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to study the properties of massive stellar populations in metal - poor environments which are not available in the local group .    in 1993 , a program was begun to obtain high signal - to - noise spectra for a large sample of a low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies in order to measure the primordial helium abundance ( itl94 , itl97 , it98 , thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1995 ) .",
    "a large fraction of these spectra ( @xmath7 50% ) showed broad emission characteristic of wn and wc stars .",
    "while some of these objects are known to contain wr stars from previous studies , the majority are newly discovered wr galaxies .",
    "we have assembled here , from our large data base , a sample of 39 wr galaxies with the aim of studying their spectroscopic properties .",
    "in particular , we wish to determine the @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) and @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratios for all these galaxies , and use the data to constrain models of massive star evolution .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and data reduction . in section 3",
    "we discuss heavy element abundances for a subsample of wr galaxies , with previously unpublished observations . in section 4",
    "we describe the wr features detected in our spectra , some of which have not been discussed before in the literature .",
    "in section 5 we present a new method for deriving the numbers of wr and o stars . in section 6",
    "we compare our results with other observational data as well as with theoretical models , and discuss the effects of metallicity and starburst age on the wr stellar population .",
    "in section 7 we discuss the origin of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 line emission .",
    "section 8 contains a summary of our main results and conclusions .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of 38 galaxies with detected or suspected broad wr emission features were obtained with the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope , and with the goldcam spectrograph at the 2.1 m kpno telescope .",
    "the 4 m observations were carried out during the period 19931994 while the 2.1 m observations were obtained in 1996 .",
    "the majority of the galaxies in our sample were selected from the first byurakan survey ( markarian et al .",
    "1989 ) , and from a complete sample of @xmath7 250 bcds ( izotov et al .",
    "1993 ) discovered in the second byurakan objective prism survey ( sbs , markarian , lipovetsky & stepanian 1983 ) .",
    "four low - metallicity galaxies are from the michigan survey ( salzer , macalpine & boroson 1989 ) .",
    "we have also included the bcd ii zw 40 , known to possess wr features ( conti 1991 ) .",
    "in addition to these 38 galaxies observed at kpno , we have included the bcd i zw 18 because of its extremely low metallicity .",
    "the spectrum of i zw 18 was obtained in 1997 with the multiple mirror telescope ( izotov et al .",
    "hence the total sample contains 39 galaxies . because of the high signal - to - noise ratio required to determine an accurate helium abundance , our spectra allow to detect wr features not only in the blue region , but also in the rarely observed c iv @xmath15808 region .",
    "several other lower intensity wr emission lines are also seen .",

    "all observations were performed in the same way .",
    "the slit was centered on the brightest part of each galaxy .",
    "total exposure times varied between 10 and 180 minutes .",
    "each exposure was broken up into 2  6 subexposures to allow for more effective cosmic ray removal , except for sbs 0948 + 532 for which only one exposure was obtained .",
    "for the majority of galaxies , a 2  wide slit was used set at the position angle given in table 2 .",
    "the exception is i zw 18 which was observed with a 15 wide slit .",
    "the spectral resolution was 6 - 7    in all cases .",
    "except for three objects observed at airmass @xmath7 1.6 and position angle 90 degrees , the vast majority of galaxies were observed at small airmasses , so that no correction for atmospheric dispersion was performed .",
    "several spectrophotometric standard stars were observed each night for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he - ne - ar comparison lamps were obtained before and after observation of each galaxy to provide wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction was performed with the iraf software package and included bias subtraction , cosmic ray removal , flat - field correction , flux and wavelength calibrations , correction for atmospheric extinction and subtraction of the night sky background .",
    "the residuals of the night sky lines after subtraction are @xmath9 1% .",
    "line intensities and heavy element abundances for the majority of the wr galaxies have been given previously in a series of papers on the primordial helium abundance ( itl94 , itl97 , it98 ) and on heavy element abundances ( thuan et al .",
    "1995 , izotov & thuan 1999 ) . to derive heavy element abundances for the twelve remaining galaxies we follow the procedure described in itl94 and itl97 .",

    "the latter is set to be the same for all hydrogen lines .",
    "we note that the intensity of the he i @xmath15876 emission line in ii zw 40 is reduced , because of absorption by galactic neutral sodium , just as in the case of i zw 18 ( izotov & thuan 1998a ) .",
    "the he i @xmath15876 emission line in mrk 178 is contaminated by the strong nearby wr c iv @xmath15808 emission line ( figure 1 ) , while this line in the spectrum of mrk 1329 is on a bad ccd column , making its intensity unreliable .",
    "the ionic and total heavy element abundances of the four galaxies in table 2 with detected [ o iii ] @xmath14363 emission line are shown in table 4 .",
    "the oxygen abundance 12 + log ( o / h ) derived in these galaxies ranges from 7.82 to 8.23 and is in fair agreement with previous determinations .",

    "the oxygen abundances for the galaxies with nondetected [ o iii ] @xmath14363 are shown in table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that they are considerably larger than those of galaxies with detected [ o iii]@xmath14363 , exceeding in some cases the solar oxygen abundance .",
    "the oxygen abundance of 9.03 derived us for mrk 710 is in good agreement with the values of 9.09 obtained by vacca & conti ( 1992 ) and that of 9.00 obtained by schaerer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "examination of table 1 shows that the wr galaxies in our sample span an oxygen abundance range extending over two orders of magnitude ( @xmath0/50 to 2@xmath0 ) .",
    "this unique sample allows us to study the properties of wr stellar populations in a wide range of heavy element abundances .",
    "we now discuss the properties of wr galaxy spectra . in low - resolution spectra of wr galaxies the blue bump at @xmath14650 is most often seen .",
    "this unresolved bump is a blend of the n v @xmath14605 , 4620 , n iii @xmath14634 , 4640 ,",
    "c iii / c iv @xmath14650 , 4658 and he ii @xmath14686 broad wr lines .",
    "these are emitted mainly by late wn ( wnl ) and early wc ( wce ) stars , although some contribution of early wn ( wne ) stars might be present ( sv98 ) .",
    "superposed on the blue bump are much narrower [ fe iii ] @xmath14658 , he ii @xmath14686 , he i + [ ar iv ] @xmath14711 and [ ar iv ] @xmath14740 nebular emission lines .",
    "the detectability of the weaker red bump , emitted mainly by wce stars , is lower .",
    "hence , the observed characteristics of wr galaxies are restricted to a narrow range of wr star subtypes , most often wnl and wce stars .",
    "can other wr subtypes be seen in integrated spectra of wr galaxies ?",
    "each wr star , depending on the metallicity and mass of the progenitor , may evolve through different wr subtypes from wnl to wce .",
    "wne stars emit n v @xmath14605 , 4620 , c iv @xmath14658 , he ii @xmath14686 and c iv @xmath15808 ( e.g. smith et al . 1996 ) and hence can not be distinguished from other wr stars in low - resolution spectra .",
    "additionally , wne stars are not as luminous as wnl stars in the optical range .",
    "the wr star lifetime in the wne stage is short compared to that in the wnl stage for nearly all metallicities and progenitor star masses ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , in the majority of cases the contribution of wne stars to the blue bump is expected to be small .",
    "however , evolution models of maeder & meynet ( 1994 ) predict that at high metallicities and low wr progenitor star masses , the wne lifetime is greater than the wnl one . hence , at late stages of instantaneous bursts in metal - rich wr galaxies the contribution of wne stars can be significant .",
    "the c iii @xmath14650 , @xmath15696 emission lines are seen mainly in late - type wc stars ( wc7  wc9 ) .",
    "no normal wc star of type later than wc9 has been detected .",
    "however , some central stars of planetary nebulae have characteristics of wr stars and are classified as [ wc10 ]  [ wc12 ] ( e.g. leuenhagen & hamann 1994 , 1998 ; leuenhagen , hamann & jeffery 1996 ) . in the spectra of these stars , c ii @xmath14267 emission and some other c ii lines are observed .",
    "it is thought that late wc stars are to be seen only in regions with metallicity greater than solar ( smith 1991 ; smith & maeder 1991 ; phillips & conti 1992 ) .",
    "since the majority of starburst wr galaxies have lower metallicities than solar , they are not expected to contain wcl stars .    as for the late wn ( wn9  wn11 ) stars , they produce n ii , n iii and si iii lines ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "1995 ; crowther et al .",
    "1997 ; crowther & smith 1997 ) and are bright , therefore they should be detected in the spectra of wr galaxies .",
    "however , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra are required because these wnl features are weak .",

    "we describe our procedure for determining the number of o and wr stars from the spectroscopic data . in general , the number of wr stars is derived from the luminosity of a wr line , while the number of o stars is deduced from the h@xmath2 luminosity after subtracting the contribution of wr stars from it . because the h@xmath2 emission is extended and the slit usually does not cover the whole region of ionized gas emission , care should be exercised to correct for lost light .",
    "therefore , one - dimensional spectra with one pixel step along the spatial axis of the slit have been extracted from the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath2 fluxes were then measured for each one - dimensional spectrum where this line was detected . as for the equivalent width of h@xmath2 , it was measured in the one - dimensional spectrum extracted in the largest possible aperture with diameter equal to the whole spatial extent of the slit .",
    "the wr fluxes are derived from one - dimensional spectra with aperture covering the regions where wr emission is present .",
    "the measured h@xmath2 flux can not be used directly for the determination of the number of ionizing o stars because of the aperture effect discussed by conti ( 1991 ) and vacca & conti ( 1992 ) : while the region with the brightest h@xmath2 emission where the stellar cluster is located is usually covered by the slit , a significant fraction of the h@xmath2 emission from the extended h ii region may be outside of it .",
    "emission can spread far away from the center of the o and wr star cluster .    to take into account this effect",
    "the following procedure has been adopted .",
    "we assume that the brightness distribution of each object has a circular symmetry , with the center of the cell with the maximum h@xmath2 flux ( all h@xmath2 fluxes are extinction - corrected ) chosen to be the center of symmetry .",
    "however , if the flux in adjacent cells exceeds 0.7 the flux in the brightest cell , the center was shifted by half a cell in the direction of that cell .",
    "since the distribution of fluxes on opposite sides from the center would generally not be equal , we consider each object as a set of homogeneous half - rings .",
    "this yields a correction factor @xmath21 for each cell @xmath22 along the slit of the form : @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cell sizes along and across the slit expressed in arcsec , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the distances from the center of symmetry to the near and far edges of the cell .",
    "@xmath21 is thus just the ratio of the area of a half - ring to that of a cell .",
    "this procedure is used for all cells along the slit .",
    "the h@xmath2 fluxes in each half - ring are then summed together to give the extinction and aperture - corrected h@xmath2 flux and the mean correction factor @xmath28 is derived as the ratio of the extinction and aperture - corrected h@xmath2 flux to the h@xmath2 flux corrected only for extinction .",
    "the corrected h@xmath2 fluxes are shown in table 5 together with the correction factors @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29(h@xmath2 ) , is the absolute flux , corrected for interstellar extinction and aperture , while @xmath17(h@xmath2 ) is the absolute flux measured along the slit and corrected only for interstellar extinction .",
    "we also show in table 5 other relevant parameters for the h ii regions : the coefficient for interstellar extinction @xmath16(h@xmath2 ) derived from the observed balmer decrement in the spectrum of the brightest region , the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line , the age of the star formation burst derived from @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) and the parameter @xmath30 to be discussed below .",
    "@xmath4(h@xmath2 ) is also subject to aperture effects and its aperture correction factor may be as large as @xmath28 for the h@xmath2 flux .",
    "therefore , h@xmath2 equivalent widths of star - forming regions not corrected for aperture effects are lower limits and ages of star formation bursts derived from noncorrected @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) should be considered as an upper limits .",
    "we can not however derive correction factors for @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) from the spectra alone , as the underlying galaxy can also contribute to the continuum and decrease @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) as compared to the case where the continuum is produced by the star - forming region only .",
    "the above aperture correction procedure has not been applied to the wn and wc bump fluxes because that emission comes from very compact regions with angular sizes usually not greater than the slitwidth .",
    "those fluxes have been measured instead in the integrated spectrum obtained by summing in the spatial direction all one - pixel - sized one - dimensional spectra where wr emission features are detected . in only five galaxies",
    "0635 + 756 , 0952 + 095 , 1030 + 583 , 1053 + 064 and 1211 + 540 , is the angular size of wr regions along the slit slightly larger than the slit width . for those galaxies , the measured fluxes of wr features",
    "should be considered as lower limits .",
    "the correction factors are however very close to unity .",
    "a careful subtraction of the continuum is essential for deriving accurate wr bump fluxes and hence numbers of wr stars . to define the continuum , we carefully select several points in spectral regions free of nebular and stellar lines .",
    "the continuum is then fitted by cubic splines . the quality of the continuum fit is visually checked and if deemed satisfactory is subtracted from the spectrum .    on top of the blue bump",
    "are superposed [ fe iii ] @xmath14658 , he ii @xmath14686 , [ ar iv ] + he i @xmath14712 and [ ar iv ] @xmath14740 narrow nebular emission lines .",
    "these nebular lines have been subtracted from the bump using the iraf splot software package .",
    "we then measure the fluxes of the broad components within a specified wavelength range which is varying because of the changing appearance of broad components in galaxies with different burst ages .",
    "similar measurements have been done for other weaker wr lines .",
    "the results of the measurements are shown in table 6 .",
    "here @xmath17(@xmath1 ) and @xmath4(@xmath1 ) are the total fluxes corrected for interstellar extinction and equivalent widths of different wr lines .",
    "we estimate the number of wr stars from the luminosity of the blue ( @xmath14650 ) and red ( @xmath15808 ) bumps . in principle , if the luminosity of one wr star in a specific broad line or in the whole bump is known , we can derive the number of wr stars : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the absolute luminosity of the wr bump ( or of one wr line ) corrected for interstellar extinction , and @xmath33 is the luminosity of the wr bump ( or of one wr line ) of a single wr star .",
    "usually , wc4 stars are considered as representatives of wce stars , while wn7 stars are considered as representatives of wnl stars . in the following , to derive the numbers of wr stars we shall use parameters relevant to wc4 and wn7 stars .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that wne stars can contribute to the blue bump at late wr stages in high - metallicity galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of the red bump includes only the c iv @xmath15808 line and gives directly the number of wce stars .",
    "the situation with the blue bump is more complicated . to determine the number of wnl stars",
    ", the contribution of wce stars to the blue bump should be removed .",
    "to do this we use the luminosity of the red bump and introduce the coefficient @xmath34 then the luminosity of wc4 stars which should be subtracted from the total luminosity of the blue bump is equal to @xmath35@xmath36(@xmath15808 ) . the value of the coefficient @xmath35 not well known .",
    "smith ( 1991 ) gives @xmath35 = 1.52 , while sv98 obtain @xmath35 = 1.71@xmath370.53 , consistent with the smith value within the errors .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is uncertain because the relative fluxes of individual lines vary strongly even within the same wr subtype ( see tables 1 and 2 in sv98 ) .",
    "luminosities of single wr stars are also known poorly .",
    "smith ( 1991 ) adopts a luminosity of 3.2@xmath3810@xmath39 ergs s@xmath15 for a single wnl star in the blue bump and for a single wc4 star in the red bump from observations of wr stars in the large magellanic cloud , while vacca & conti ( 1992 ) favor a luminosity of 2.5@xmath3810@xmath39 ergs s@xmath15 for a single wc4 star in the red bump .",
    "sv98 have compiled the luminosities of wr stars in different emission lines .",

    "relative to h@xmath2 ( tables 5  6 ) are in general several times larger than those predicted by grandi .",

    "however there is a very large spread of points at a fixed metallicity . at 12 + log ( o / h )",

    "? we can not completely exclude this possibility as we observed only nuclear starbursts in the bright highest - metallicity galaxies .",
    "there exists the possibility that wr stars can be found with high s / n observations in faint non - nuclear metal - rich h ii regions .",
    "however , we believe that the most likely reason for the non - detection of galaxies with faint @xmath44(@xmath14650 ) in the 8.2 @xmath9 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath9 9.1 abundance range , is not because their wr bumps can not be detected , but simply because there are no dwarf galaxies in this high metallicity range .",

    "this decrease is expected from massive stellar evolution models ( maeder 1991 ; maeder & meynet 1994 ; meynet 1995 ; sv98 ) and it is consistent with earlier observations of wr galaxies ( vacca & conti 1992 ; masegosa et al . 1991 ; kunth & schild 1986 ; kunth & joubert 1985 ) where no galaxy with oxygen abundance 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath9 7.9 was ever seen to contain wr stars .",
    "a possible exception was the galaxy zw 0855 + 06 , although there was some controversy about its oxygen abundance : vacca & conti ( 1992 ) derived 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.72 while kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) obtained a value of 8.40 .",
    "however , the increase in detector sensitivity and the use of large telescopes for the detection of weak low - contrast wr features in galaxies have changed the situation . the discovery of wr stars in i zw 18 ( @xmath0/50 , izotov et al . 1997 ; legrand et al .",
    "1997 ) and sbs 0335052 ( @xmath0/40 , izotov et al .",
    "1999a ) implies that the luminosity of the wr bump can not keep on decreasing with decreasing metallicity . instead , the data in fig . 3 for those galaxies suggest that the luminosity of the blue bump appears to become roughly constant for 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath65 7.9 , although this conclusion is based only on a few data points .",
    "the data on wr populations in low - metallicity galaxies is very scarce for two reasons .",
    "first , such low - metallicity objects are extremely rare and second , the time spent by massive stars in the wr stage is very short at low metallicities , which make them hard to detect .",
    "the discovery of wr stellar populations in the two most metal - deficient galaxies known has increased substantially the metallicity range for wr galaxies .",
    "our wr galaxy sample spans two orders of magnitude in metallicity , from @xmath0/50 ( i zw 18 ) to @xmath7 2@xmath0 ( 0720 + 335 @xmath20 mrk 1199 ) , allowing to compare observed and predicted relative numbers of wr stars and check the validity of theoretical models in a wide range of metal abundances . in the following",
    "we compare the properties of the observed wr population in our galaxies with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models by sv98 for the range of heavy element mass fraction @xmath6 = 0.001  0.02 and by schaerer ( 1998 , private communication ) for @xmath6 = 0.0004 .",
    "figure 4 shows the number ratio @xmath3(wr ) / @xmath3(o + wr ) for our sample galaxies ( filled circles ) vs. metallicity .",

    "( 1999a ) ( open circles ) , kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) ( asterisks ) and vacca & conti ( 1992 ) ( diamonds ) . while the relative numbers of wr stars are derived by schaerer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) in the same way as ours , they are derived differently by kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) and vacca & conti ( 1992 ) and can not be compared directly with our data .",
    "therefore , we have recalculated the relative numbers of wr stars by the same method , using the fluxes and equivalent widths of nebular and wr emission lines published by those authors .",
    "however , the red bumps were not detected in their observations and therefore we have no information about the relative contribution of wce stars to the blue bump .",
    "furthermore , for other authors data , we can not correct the flux in the h@xmath2 emission line for aperture effects for lack of information .",
    "inspection of table 5 shows that the mean correction factor for aperture effects is @xmath7 2  3 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath2 fluxes are underestimated and the relative numbers of wr to ( o + wr ) stars derived from the data by kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) , vacca & conti ( 1992 ) and schaerer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) are slightly overestimated as is evidenced by a small upward shift of their data compared to ours .",
    "note that the detectability limit of wr populations in our galaxies is better compared to other observations because of the generally higher signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra .    for each of the four galaxies in our sample with metallicity greater than solar ( 0211 + 038 , 0720 + 335 , 0952 + 095 , 1036069 ) we show two values of @xmath3(wr ) / @xmath3(o + wr ) connected by dashed lines .",
    "lower limits are calculated assuming the correction factor @xmath30 to be 1 . however , the equivalent widths of the h@xmath2 emission line in these galaxies are @xmath9 30  and hence the ages of the star bursts are @xmath43 5.3 myr ( table 5 ) .",
    "for these ages , high - metallicity o stars are not expected , the definition of @xmath30 becomes meaningless and the ionizing flux is provided by stars of type b or later and wr stars ( sv98 ) . therefore , upper limits are set to @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) = 1 for the four metal - rich galaxies . at the low - metallicity end , the @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) ratio for i zw 18 ( filled circle ) is probably underestimated by a factor of @xmath7 2 because the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line in the bcd s nw component , equal to 67 , and the parameter @xmath30 = 0.2 give a relatively large age of 5.9 myr .",
    "a burst age of 45 myr , seems more reasonable as it is only slightly larger than the age estimated from the h@xmath2 equivalent width of the se component of i zw 18 ( 128  ) where wr stars are not seen . to illustrate how @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o + wr ) changes as a function of adopted age , we show respectively by an open rectangle and an open triangle the @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) ratios expected in i zw 18 for instantaneous burst ages of 4 myr ( @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 100 ) and 3 myr ( @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 200 ) , in addition to the ratio for a burst age of 5.9 myr ( filled circle ) . for the other galaxies , the @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr )",
    "ratio may increase slightly when their h@xmath2 equivalent width is corrected for aperture effects .",
    "this is because a correction would increase @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) , which would increase @xmath30 and decrease the number of o stars .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "4 that the fraction of wr stars relative to other massive stars increases with increasing metallicity , as first noted by kunth & schild ( 1986 ) .",
    "this increase is in agreement with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models ( mas - hesse & kunth 1991 ; krger et al .",
    "1992 ; cervio & mas - hesse 1994 ; meynet 1995 ; sv98 ) .    the solid line in fig .",
    "4 shows the maximum theoretical values of @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) ratios as a function of metallicity as predicted by sv98 and schaerer ( 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "we have used the instantaneous burst models with a salpeter imf slope @xmath10=2.35 and @xmath66=120@xmath67 , except for the metallicity @xmath6 = @xmath0/50 for which @xmath66 = 150 @xmath56 is adopted .",
    "nearly all our galaxies lie below the solid line , in agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the spread of points can be understood as caused by the strong dependence on time of the wr star relative numbers during the short wr stage of the starburst .",
    "evolutionary synthesis models predict that the number of wr stars rises to a maximum value and then falls down to zero on the short time scale of 1 myr for @xmath6 = @xmath0/50 and of 5 myr for @xmath6 = @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum value depends on the imf and the heavy element mass fraction @xmath6 , since at a higher metallicity the minimum mass limit for a star which undergoes the wr phase is lower . in fig .",
    "4 the evolutionary track of a galaxy undergoing a star formation burst would describe a loop .",
    "an object rushes up and reaches the maximum @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) value ( solid line ) , and after that drops down , drifting slightly to higher @xmath6 , because massive stars would enrich the surrounding environment with heavy elements via stellar winds and supernova explosions ( maeder & meynet 1994 ; esteban & peimbert 1995 ; pilyugin 1994 ) . in this scenario",
    "we would expect different objects at different stages of wr evolution to scatter in the region under the solid line , as is observed .",
    "the lack of galaxies with high @xmath6 and small relative number of wr stars can be understood as a selection effect .",
    "we have observed only nuclear starbursts in highest - metallicity galaxies as nuclear regions constitute an especially favorable environment for the formation of numerous massive stars .",
    "it is likely that this region will be filled in when higher signal - to - noise ratio observations of non - nuclear metal - rich h ii regions are carried out .",
    "another factor which may account for the observed spread of points is the finite duration of the starburst .",
    "the assumption of an instantaneous burst where all stars are formed at the same time , represents a limiting case .",
    "high spatial resolution studies of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( e.g. thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1997 ; papaderos et al .",
    "1998 ) show that star forming regions consist of several clusters with an age spread of several myr .",
    "thus real star formation should be intermediate between the instantaneous burst and continuous star formation cases .",
    "the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "4 shows the theoretical prediction for the other limiting case , a continuous star formation model .",
    "the data scatters nicely between the two limiting cases , implying that the models are basically correct .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the wc - to - wn star number ratio on metallicity .",
    "it is seen that galaxies with relatively large numbers of wc stars ( the so - called wc galaxies ) possess a very narrow range of metallicites , with 12 + log ( o / h ) going only from 7.8 to 8.2 .",
    "these large @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratios can be explained in terms of the bursting nature of the star formation .",
    "the thick solid line in figure 5 shows the maximum values of @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) as a function of oxygen abundance as predicted by theoretical models ( sv98 ; schaerer 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "these instantaneous burst models use stellar evolution models with enhanced mass - loss ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) , and are characterized by the same parameters as described before .",
    "the theoretical curve delineates quite well the left boundary of the region where the data points in the range of oxygen abundance 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.6  8.3 scatter .    however , the agreement for the extremely metal - deficient galaxy i zw 18 is not so good .",
    "the observed @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) in this galaxy is @xmath7 0.28 while models predict @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) @xmath68 0.09 .",
    "this discrepancy can not be due to our adopted values of line luminosities of single wr stars since we use the same values as sv98 .",
    "in contrast to the relative number of wr stars , the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio does not suffer from aperture effects .",
    "the numbers of wnl stars in i zw 18 of 45 and 36 derived from the weaker lines n iii @xmath14512 and si iii @xmath14565 respectively ( table 7 ) are very close to the value of 44 derived from the blue bump .",
    "these values are derived with a distance of 20 mpc to i zw 18 ( izotov et al .",
    "on the other hand , if the same distance is adopted , legrand et al . (",
    "1997 ) detect only 3  6 wce stars and no wn star , so that their @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio is uncertain . de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtain @xmath3(wn ) @xmath7 30 from analysis of _ hubble space telescope _ images , which results in an even larger @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio for i zw 18 .",
    "hence , we conclude that models fail to predict the correct @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio at very low metallicity .",
    "however , because of the small numbers of wr stars in i zw 18 ( @xmath7 45 wnl and @xmath7 12 wce stars ) and the small slit width of 15 used in the spectroscopic observations , we can not exclude the possibility that we are observing in i zw 18 a region with a locally enhanced number of wce stars .",
    "therefore , high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) two - dimensional spectroscopic mapping is necessary to check this possibility . the existing two - dimensional spectroscopic data on i zw 18 by vlchez & iglesias - pramo ( 1998 ) have too low a snr for wr features to be seen .",
    "the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio derived for the galaxies in our sample is very different from that expected in the case of continuous star formation as derived empirically by observations of local group galaxies .",
    "we show by diamonds in fig .",
    "5 the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratios in the local group galaxies m33 , m31 , ngc 6822 , smc , lmc , ic 10 and the milky way based on observations of individual wr stars ( massey & johnson 1998 ) . the linear fit to these data excluding the 2 deviant points of ic 10 and the milky way given by massey & johnson ( 1998 ) is shown by the dashed line .",
    "this fit can be considered as an empirical determination of the dependence of the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio on metallicity in the case of continuous star formation .",
    "it predicts @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) to approach 0 for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath9 8.1 and agrees well with the predictions of massive stellar evolution models with enhanced mass - loss for continuous star formation with a constant rate .",
    "the galaxy ic 10 was excluded by massey & johnson ( 1998 ) from the determination of the correlation because of its very large @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio of @xmath7 2 ( although that ratio may be as small as 1.4 if uncertainties are taken into account ) .",
    "those authors suggest that such a high value is caused by the bursting nature of star formation in ic 10 .",
    "indeed , this galaxy , together with our galaxies with oxygen abundances in the range from 7.8 to 8.2 , can be understood in terms of models with an instantaneous starburst as shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "the five galaxies in our sample at the high end of oxygen abundance 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath43 8.6 lie systematically below the fit of massey & johnson ( 1998 ) while no galaxy with high metallicity is found above it .",
    "the same result has been obtained by schaerer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) for two metal - rich galaxies he 2 - 10 ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath0/2 ) and mrk 710 ( @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath0 ) .",
    "these low values may be partly due to the assumption that wce stars dominate among wc stars .",
    "if we assume instead that wc7 stars are the main contributors to the c iv @xmath15808 emission line in high - metallicity galaxies then the relative number of wc - to - wn stars is increased by a factor of @xmath7 4 because of the lower luminosity of wc7 stars , just accounting for the discrepancy between the values given by the fit for continuous star formation ( dashed line ) and the observed values . however , in this case an appreciable c iii @xmath15696 emission line is expected in the spectra of high - metallicity galaxies because the luminosity ratio @xmath44(c iii @xmath15696)/@xmath44(c iv @xmath15808 ) for a single wc7 star is @xmath7 0.5 ( sv98 ) . thus far , the c iii @xmath15696 line has been seen only in mrk 710 ( schaerer et al . 1999a ; this paper ) .",
    "additionally , wne stars can significantly contribute to the luminosity of blue bump in these galaxies , decreasing even more the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio because the luminosity of a single wne star in this bump is @xmath7 3 times lower than that of a wnl star ( sv98 ) .",
    "but , probably , the main reason for the low @xmath3(wc ) / @xmath3(wn ) ratios in high - metallicity galaxies is the bursting nature of star formation in these galaxies , with different durations of the successive wnl , wne and wce stages .",
    "all five galaxies have low equivalent widths of h@xmath2 ( table 5 ) and hence they are in the late stage of the wr episode with starburst ages @xmath43 5.3 myr , when mainly wn stars are present while the number of wc stars drops to 0 ( sv98 ) .",
    "in summary , analysis of the @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio shows good general agreement between the observational data and the model predictions , except in the case of the very low metallicity galaxy i zw 18 .",
    "the detection of wr stars in other extremely metal - deficient galaxies is necessary to clarify the situation at the low - metallicity end .      due to the bursting nature of star formation in wr galaxies ,",
    "the relative number of wr stars is a sensitive function of time elapsed since the beginning of the star formation episode .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) can be used with a certain degree of confidence as an indicator of the age of star formation region .",
    "the hydrogen ionizing flux of a star cluster gradually decreases as the most massive stars disappear . as a result",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath2 decreases with time .",
    "the theoretical behavior of @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) with time for an instantaneous burst is given by sv98 for a set of metallicities ranging from @xmath0/20 to 2@xmath0 .",
    "figure 6 shows the dependence of the @xmath3(wr ) / @xmath3(o+wr ) ratio as a function of the age of an instantaneous burst occuring at time @xmath55 = 0 . because this ratio is a strong function of the heavy element mass fraction @xmath6 , we divided objects from our sample ( filled circles ) and from kunth & joubert ( 1985 ) ( asterisks ) , vacca & conti ( 1992 ) ( diamonds ) and schaerer et al .",

    "we compare the observed distributions with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models by sv98 shown by solid lines and labeled by their heavy element mass fraction . for metal - rich galaxies",

    "taking into account the uncertainties in deriving the @xmath3(wr)/@xmath3(o+wr ) ratio ( observational errors , uncertainties in the age of starburst , breakdown of the instantaneous burst approximation and other model assumptions ) , we find a good general agreement between the relative numbers of wr stars predicted by the theoretical models and those inferred from observations , especially for objects in the range of heavy element mass fraction @xmath6 = 0.002  0.010 ( figures 6b , 6c ) .",
    "the agreement is not so good for the most metal - deficient galaxies ( figure 6d ) , including i zw 18 . for the latter",
    ", we expect that part of the disagreement may come from uncertainties in the age determination with the use of the h@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "it is known that the ionized gas distribution in the nw component of i zw 18 is very complex with wr stars located in a hole with very low @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) ( izotov et al .",
    "the presence of a large h@xmath10 halo in i zw 18 suggests that some of the h ii regions in it are density - bounded ( dufour & hester 1990 ; martin 1996 ) . in this case part of the ionizing photons will escape the h ii region , resulting in a lower equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "the most deviant point in figure 6d belongs to the galaxy mrk 178 .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by small statistics in the number of wr stars which are only a few ( @xmath7 2  3 ) in this galaxy , and by uncertainties in the burst age determination .",
    "the equivalent widths of the blue and red bumps as a function of h@xmath2 equivalent width are shown respectively in figures 7 and 8 .",

    "by contrast , different subtypes of wr stars contribute to the blue bump . therefore , while the theoretical curves in figure 8 represent only @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) , for the blue bump the theoretical curves shown in figure 7 are the sum of the n iii @xmath14640 , c iii / c iv @xmath14658 and he ii @xmath14686 wr emission line equivalent widths .",

    "we do not consider these galaxies in our analysis .",
    "again , we find general good agreement between observations and theory for @xmath4(@xmath14650 ) and @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) of objects with heavy element fraction @xmath6 @xmath63 0.002 ( fig . 7a7c and 8a8c ) .",
    "the relatively low values of the observed @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) in fig . 8a and",

    "high - metallicity objects in our sample are likely to be in a late wr stage and hence they are observed after the wc bump equivalent width reaches its maximum value .",
    "this supports our previous conclusion in section 6.2 that the low @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratios in high - metallicity galaxies are lower than those predicted by the continuous star formation empirical relationship ( fig .",
    "5 ) because of the bursting nature of star formation in these galaxies . in both figures 7 and 8 , there appears to be a slight systematic shift of the data points to the left of the theoretical curves by log @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 0.4 .",
    "this implies that the models predict systematically larger @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) by a factor of @xmath7 2.5 , i.e. smaller burst ages as compared to those implied by the observations .",
    "however , we expect that correction for aperture effects will increase @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) making the agreement better .",
    "agreement is not so good however for the galaxies with lowest metallicities .",
    "theoretical predictions with the salpeter imf slope @xmath10 = 2.35 are below our observed data points for both @xmath4(@xmath14650 ) and @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) .",
    "models with a very shallow imf slope @xmath10 = 1.0 also fail to explain the observed points .",
    "we note that , in contrast , de mello et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found satisfactory agreement between the predicted @xmath4(@xmath14650 ) and @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) and the values observed by legrand et al .",
    "however , those authors observations did not include the region of maximum wr emission .",
    "this region was found by izotov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to have several times larger @xmath4(@xmath14650 ) and @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) , leading to the discrepancy between models and observations discussed here .",
    "it is likely , that the disagreement comes from the different properties of wce stars at low metallicities as compared to those in the galaxy and local group galaxies .",
    "we suspect that single low - metallicity wce star luminosities in the c iv @xmath14658 and c iv @xmath15808 lines are @xmath7 2  4 times larger than those adopted by sv98 .",
    "the use of smith s ( 1991 ) wr star emission line luminosities would increase @xmath4(@xmath14650 ) and @xmath4(@xmath15808 ) ( sv98 , de mello et al .",
    "1998 ) , but by an amount not large enough to account for the observed values in i zw 18 .",
    "observational data for single wr stars are not available at such low metallicities .",
    "however , some arguments in favor of a larger wce star line luminosity at low metallicity come from the calculations of maeder & meynet ( 1994 ) .",
    "they have shown that , for a given fixed mass of the progenitor star , both the total luminosity of a wce star and its surface c / he abundance ratio are larger at very low metallicities .",
    "the luminosity of a wnl star also increases with decreasing metallicity , but by not such a large amount .",
    "hence , we expect that the net effect might be an increase of both the blue and red bump model equivalent widths , in better agreement with observations .",
    "a higher line luminosity of low - metallicity wce stars would also result in a better agreement between the observed and predicted @xmath3(wc)/@xmath3(wn ) ratio for i zw 18 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , since the observed value would be reduced .",
    "there is another factor which may increase the equivalent widths of the blue and red bumps .",
    "theory predicts that wr stars in massive close binary systems in the late ( @xmath69 5 myr ) phases of an instantaneous burst of star formation may have larger equivalent widths ( sv98 ) .",
    "however the properties of wr stars in binaries are still poorly known .",
    "the strong nebular he ii @xmath14686 emission line has been detected in many low - metallicity blue compact galaxies ( in @xmath7 50% of the sample ) observed by itl94 , itl97 , thuan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , it98 , izotov et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "its intensity , exceeding @xmath7 3% that of h@xmath2 in some objects , is several orders of magnitude larger than theoretical values predicted by models of photoionized h ii regions ( e.g. stasiska 1990 ) .",
    "it was suggested by bergeron ( 1977 ) , that the he ii emission in dwarf emission - line galaxies could arise in the atmospheres of of stars .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1991 ) obtained observations of nebulae in nearby dwarf galaxies with strong narrow he ii @xmath14686 emission lines and examined several possible excitation mechanisms , concluding that the radiation field associated with star - forming regions can be harder than previously suspected .",
    "more recently schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) calculated non - lte atmosphere models taking into account line blanketing and stellar winds and found that the flux in the he ii continuum is increased by 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes compared to predictions from plane - parallel non - lte model atmospheres and by 3 to 6 orders of magnitudes compared to predictions from plane parallel lte model atmospheres .",
    "however , for young starbursts dominated by o stars ( @xmath55 @xmath9 3 myr ) , typical values of @xmath18(he ii)/@xmath18(h@xmath2 ) are between 5@xmath3810@xmath70 and 2@xmath3810@xmath71 , still far below the observed intensities .",
    "schaerer ( 1996 ) synthesized the nebular and wolf - rayet he ii @xmath14686 emission in young starbursts .",
    "for heavy element mass fractions @xmath0/5",
    "@xmath9 @xmath6 @xmath9@xmath0 , he predicted a strong nebular he ii emission due to a significant fraction of wc stars in the early wr phases of the burst , and concluded that the predictions ( typically @xmath18(he ii)/@xmath18(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 0.01  0.025 ) agree well with the observations .",
    "sv98 proposed that hot wn stars may also play a role .",
    "another mechanism , suggested by garnett et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , is that radiative shocks in giant h ii regions can produce relatively strong he ii emission under certain conditions .",
    "the strength of the he ii emission is sensitive mostly to the velocity of the shock , reaching a maximum for @xmath72@xmath73 @xmath7 120 km s@xmath15 , and dropping rapidly at higher velocities .",
    "to study the possible mechanisms responsible for the emission of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 line , we gathered a sample of galaxies from the present study and previous papers ( itl94 , itl97 , it98 , thuan et al .",
    "1995 ) showing nebular he ii @xmath14686 .",
    "the galaxies are listed in table 8 .",
    "no nebular he ii @xmath14686 emission was detected in galaxies with 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath63 8.13 . also shown are the intensities and equivalent widths of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 line together with the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 emission line and the oxygen abundance .",
    "wr stellar emission was detected only in 18 out of the 30 h ii regions in table 8 , a 60% detection rate .",
    "a non - detection of wr features means that a galaxy contains no or too few wr stars ( several to a few tens depending on the distance of the galaxy ) to produce detectable wr emission .",
    "the number of wr stars responsible for a broad feature with peak intensity comparable to the continuum rms is approximatively given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the distance to the galaxy in mpc . typically , our spectra with no wr lines detected have @xmath76 @xmath7 30 .",
    "then , at a distance of @xmath7 10 mpc , a broad blue bump produced by @xmath69 3 wr stars can be detected .",
    "we believe that the non - detection of wr emission in some galaxies is not the result of a selection effect as the spectra of all galaxies possess approximately the same signal - to - noise ratio : it has to be large enough so we could measure accurately the intensities of the weak he i lines necessary for the primordial helium problem",
    ". moreover , they have approximatively the same relative intensity and equivalent width of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 emission line .",
    "because the nebular he ii emission region is generally smaller than the h@xmath2 emission region , we have not corrected the he ii @xmath14686 line intensity for aperture effect .",
    "we present in table 8 he ii @xmath14686 line intensities relative h@xmath2 for two cases : in column 4 , h@xmath2 is corrected only for extinction , while in column 5 h@xmath2 is corrected for both extinction and aperture effect .",
    "the aperture correction factors for h@xmath2 in the wr galaxies are given in table 5 .",
    "for the remaining objects we assume the correction factor to be 2.5 , a typical value for the objects in table 5 .",
    "figure 9 displays the dependence of the equivalent width and intensity of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 line as a function of the h@xmath2 equivalent width .",
    "theoretical predictions are also shown for stellar populations with @xmath6 = 0.0004 , 0.001 , 0.004 by dashed , solid and dotted lines , respectively ( sv98 , schaerer 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the observed equivalent widths of the nebular he ii @xmath14686 emission line in wr galaxies ( filled circles ) and in the galaxies with nondetected wr features ( open circles ) are in good agreement with values predicted by models with @xmath6 = 0.0004 and 0.001 ( figure 9b ) .",
    "as before , the observed values of @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) are systematically shifted to the left of the theoretical curves by log @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 0.4 , implying that predicted burst ages are systematically younger as compared to observations . however , as previously , correction for aperture effect would increase @xmath4(h@xmath2 ) and result in better agreement .",
    "the agreement with data is not so good however for the model with @xmath6 = 0.004 which predicts @xmath4(he ii @xmath14686 ) that are systematically higher ( figure 9a ) .",
    "figure 9b shows that the intensities of he ii @xmath14686 relative to h@xmath2 , the latter being corrected only for interstellar extinction , are systematically larger than predicted values .",
    "correction of h@xmath2 for aperture effect does result in a better agreement ( figure 9c ) .",
    "again we see a systematic shift of the data points to the left of the evolutionary synthesis models which may be due in part to the fact that the h@xmath2 equivalent width has not been corrected for aperture effect .",
    "overall , we find a satisfactory general agreement between models and observations , implying that the hard radiation of wr stars can account for many properties of the he ii @xmath14686 nebular emission in wr galaxies .",
    "however , the galaxies with lowest metallicities tend to have slightly larger nebular he ii @xmath14686 line intensities compared to those with higher metallicities ( table 8) .",
    "no nebular he ii @xmath14686 emission has been observed in galaxies with @xmath6 @xmath63 0.004 .",
    "this trend is just the opposite of what is expected from the evolutionary synthesis models by sv98 which predict nebular @xmath18(he ii @xmath14686)/@xmath18(h@xmath2 ) as high as 0.05  0.10 at solar and higher metallicities .",
    "we conclude that high - metallicity stellar models overpredict the number of photons with @xmath1 @xmath42 228   responsible for the ionization of he@xmath5 .",
    "additionally , the points representing galaxies with detected and nondetected wr features mingle indistinctly in figure 9 .",
