    "symmetry , as wide or as narrow as you may define its meaning , is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order , beauty , and perfection    _ herman weyl _ in symmetry    we may hope that the remaining two decades of our century , which began under the sign of symmetry , physicists will be able to explain how great variety of non - symmetrical forms of the real world can arise out of the beautiful , symmetrical structure of the basic equations . at the beginning of the century , einstein taught us to understand the meaning of symmetry ; we have now to learn how to break it in the most symmetrical way so that his most cherished dream , that of building a unified theory of all interactions , may one day come true",
    ".    _ luigi radicati di brozol _    these two statements express two profound and basic aspects of physics today .",
    "weyl , in his beautiful and elegant book , described as his swan song , elaborates on the role of symmetries in nature , in art and architecture , and then shows how they are transformed in mathematical forms to express laws of physics .",
    "radicatti , on the other hand , stresses the equally important fact of nature , namely , the real world does not exist in the perceived perfect symmetric form , but more naturally in its `` approximate '' or``broken '' forms .",
    "while we can build beautiful models of elementary particles and their interactions based on exact symmetries , real world defies them and remains provocative .",
    "whether it be the standard model and beyond , susy , string theory or any other theory , symmetry breaking poses as a fundamental problem .    in what follows ,",
    "i will briefly and qualitatively describe a new approach to symmetry breaking that has been the subject of study during the past few years @xcite .",
    "what i am going to describe are some non - trivial , but still in the nature of toy models .",
    "we , think , however , they do indicate a new and fruitful approach to realistic models",
    "the conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism ( ssb)in the standard model(sm ) and its extensions assumes spatially homogeneous higgs fields whose vacuum expectation values are determined by the minimization of a postulated higgs potential .",
    "the non - vanishing constant values determine the masses of the gauge and matter fields through their couplings to the higgs fields .",
    "the considerable arbitrariness involved in the choice of the potentials and the profusion of free parameters make this scheme unsatisfactory .",
    "the non - commutative geometric framework of alain connes has provided a new and elegant scheme that elevates ssb to a new level of its understanding .",
    "this is accomplished by placing higgs fields and gauge fields on a similar geometrical footing .",
    "this makes the models more predictive .",
    "however , this framework beyond its application to sm , requires departures from from the original rigorous approach and poses some problems that i can not go into in this brief report .",
    "there are , however , other types of solutions to higgs fields that can serve as stable , static background fields : topological solitons , such as kinks , strings and monoploes .",
    "but their spatially non - homogeneous nature forbids them to be used as background fields in our 3 + 1 dimensional space - time universe , since they conflict with the strong evidence of large sale homogeneity .",
    "this objection , however , does not apply to brane - world models , since the non - trivial spatial dependence of the higgs fields can be restricted to extra dimension co - ordinates only .",
    "consider , for instance , an extra dimension , coordinate @xmath0 and topologically stable higgs field configurations @xmath1 , some of which have kink form with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "then the pattern of symmetry breaking becomes a function of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the 3 + 1 dimensional brane world is located at @xmath2 with a set of localized physical fields confined to the brane at @xmath2 .",
    "if the fields are strictly confined to @xmath2 , then the unbroken symmetry is the stability group of @xmath3 , say a subgroup @xmath4 of some internal symmetry group @xmath5 .",
    "however , in quantal(or perhaps even in classical world ) , one would not expect the fields absolutely confined , in which case they couple , perhaps with reduced strength , to @xmath1 states , where @xmath0 is different from @xmath4.if the stability group @xmath6 is different from @xmath7 , then a rich effective symmetry breaking is possible on the brane    this happens when isomorphic groups @xmath8 ) left unbroken at @xmath9 _ can be differently embedded in the parent group @xmath5_. the break down at finite @xmath0 is the intersection of the asymptotic stability groups @xmath10    although @xmath11 and @xmath12 are isomorphic , their different embeddings leads to their intersection that is a smaller group .",
    "thus in general , if the vacuum manifold is disconnected and contains distinct vacuum states , the field can settle into different minimizing vacuum states in different spatial dimensions .",
    "stable solitonic or kink - like domain wall configurations can exist if the vacuum manifold has the appropriate topology .",
    "if our ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional universe is a brane or a domain wall , such a situation can arise , namely , a global @xmath13 is spontaneously broken to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 can be embedded in several different ways in the parent @xmath16and @xmath17 .    as a consequence ,",
    "a certain class of domain wall solutions connects two vacua that are invariant under differently embedded @xmath15 subgroups and there is an enhanced symmetry breakdown to the intersection of the two subgroups on the brane or domain wall . in the brane limit",
    ", @xmath15 prevails in the bulk , but smaller intersection symmetry on the brane itself .",
    "one may call this phenomenon _ clash of symmetries_.",
    "consider a model with three higgs triplets @xmath18 interacting through the potential @xmath19 @xmath20 the symmetry group of the potential is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "minimization of the potential yields three degenerate vacua , leading to a manifold consisting of three disconnected pieces , @xmath24 with the other two obtained by permutations .",
    "each global minimum induces the ssb of both the parent discrete and continuous symmetries to @xmath25 , @xmath26 .    a kink or one - dimensional domain wall configuration interpolates between the elements of disconnected vacua .",
    "a typical solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ kinksol ] ( left panel ) .",
    "a more interesting domain wall junction configuration is depicted fig [ kinksol ] ( right panel ) .",
    "three semi - infinite walls meet at a point , the origin or nexus , at angles of @xmath27 . ignoring the superfluous @xmath28 s",
    ", the clash of symmetries has the pattern :    @xmath29 along wall @xmath30 with corresponding results for @xmath31 and @xmath32    figures of global minima are shown in figs .",

    "the lagrangian consists of two complex scalar fields @xmath33 coupled to abelian gauge fields @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 with the overall continuous symmetries @xmath37 and the discrete symmetry @xmath38 .",
    "there are two distinct vacua . with appropriate boundary conditions for the scalar fields and the implied boundary conditions for the gauge fields , we find numerical solutions for the coupled equations .",
    "we obtain expected kink solutions for the scalar fields .",
    "the gauge fields diverge linearly on either side , but fall off exponentially on opposite sides ( fig .",
    "[ aplot ] ) .",
    "the @xmath28symmetries are preserved in their respective vacua but broken elsewhere .",
    "the domain wall is sandwiched between domains of constant magnetic fields parallel to the wall . in the case of a domain wall with finite thickness",
    ", there will be magnetic fields parallel to the wall on either side associated with superconducting currents , as in the case of the superconducting string solutio    thus , in addition to symmetry breaking on the brane , we find a new phenomenon such as the appearance of magnetic fields in the bulk .",
    "the starting point is a model with two complex scalar fields in a five dimensional space - time with the action : @xmath40 \\sqrt{-g } } \\ d^4x \\ dw,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and the metric is given by @xmath42 in addition to the @xmath39 symmetry , there is a discrete symmetry @xmath43 .",
    "the field equations that follow are @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where prime  denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we seek static solutions of the field equations with @xmath0 as the variable or alternately we attempt to find a potential that satisfies the equations . with the ansatz @xmath47 @xmath48",
    "we obtain an analytic solution @xmath49 which has the randall - sundrum limit @xmath50 provided , @xmath51    the sextic potential that satisfies all the field equations and is both bounded from below and has the desired global minima : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 are parameters such that @xmath57    the equations are satisfied without @xmath58 , but then the potential is not bounded from below .",
    "we note that there is a negative cosmological constant in the bulk @xmath59    in figure [ contours ] , contour plots of the potential for certain values of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are shown to illustrate the qualitative features of the extrema of the potential .",
    "the model , although in the nature of a toy model has many realistic features .",
    "it has a solution featuring clash - of - symmetric higgs kink configurations in a @xmath60 randall - sundrum space - time .",
    "gravity is localized to the dynamically generated brane , and the rs limit of the solution is well defined . for the chosen higgs kink and metric configurations , the potential has to have a certain sextic form , whose properties we have studied in some depth.the symmetry breaking pattern varies as a function of the extra dimension coordinate @xmath0 , and displays the clash of symmetries phenomenon . at all points @xmath61 , both @xmath28 are broken with alternate @xmath62 restored as @xmath63 .",
