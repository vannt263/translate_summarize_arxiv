    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has opened a new frontier in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the first data from rhic which showed a large suppression in the ratio of produced hadrons in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions @xcite has created much excitement in the heavy ion community . it has led to intense theoretical and experimental work in order to understand and characterize the outcome .",
    "more recently , hadron spectra in @xmath3 collisions at rhic were measured @xcite in order to clarify the role of and distinguish between initial state and final state ( plasma ) effects . whether the observed suppression of hadronic spectra  @xcite and disappearance of back to back jets  @xcite in central au+au collisions , as well the large elliptic flow  @xcite , in heavy ion collisions at rhic is due to",
    "the quark gluon plasma is still in need of further experimental investigation .",
    "nevertheless , the recent results from the @xmath3 collisions at rhic and the apparent lack of strong initial state effects in mid  rapidity and at high @xmath1 appear to necessitate the presence of final state interactions in the partonic matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .    even though the cronin effect @xcite ( the observation , at fixed target experiments , that the ratio of @xmath2 and @xmath5 cross sections , scaled by the number of collisions , is above unity at some intermediate @xmath1 while below one at low @xmath1 ) is likely small in high energy heavy ion collisions as compared to parton energy loss effects",
    ", it is one of the two main nuclear effects , along with shadowing , expected in high energy @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) collisions .",
    "since @xmath2 collisions were proposed in order to clarify the role of initial and final state ( medium ) effects in high energy heavy ion collisions , it is extremely important to have a firm understanding of the physics of shadowing and the cronin effect in order to have a precise understanding of the role of parton energy loss effects in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the cronin effect in high energy @xmath2 and @xmath4 collisions has been the subject of renewed theoretical interest recently @xcite . in this brief letter , we show that the numerical solution of the classical yang - mills equations of motion @xcite in the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite does indeed include the cronin effect .",
    "we point out the differences between this numerical approach and other saturation inspired models @xcite which led to the absence of the cronin effect in these models .",
    "we re - visit some of our earlier results for @xmath2 collisions and show that quantum evolution and the so called geometric scaling phenomenon @xcite ( plus change of anomalous dimension ) preserves the cronin enhancement even though its magnitude and peak may change .",
    "in the mclerran - venugopalan model , the classical yang  mills equations of motion are solved in the presence of external sources of color charge .",

    "the former corresponds to the case where monopole component of the nucleon color charge is subtracted while in the latter case , both monopole and dipole components are subtracted . as has been noted previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of these more stringent color neutrality conditions is to induce a power law dependence @xmath35 at low @xmath1 for the correlator of color charges in momentum space .",

    "the same @xmath40-factorized formalism is considered in ref .",
    "the authors however additionally consider the effects , at moderate @xmath1 s , due to the change in the unintegrated gluon distributions arising from quantum evolution .",
    "in particular , they take into account the change in the distributions due to the modification of the anomalous dimensions in the evolution .",
    "this change leads to a scaling with @xmath53 as opposed to @xmath34 scaling .",
    "( note that these modifications do not affect the prior results of ref .",

    "however , the cronin enhancement for @xmath1 distributions is missed in @xcite . on the other hand , in our numerical computations , all re - scatterings",
    "are included at the classical level leading to the cronin enhancement .",
    "note though that quantum evolution is absent in our lattice calculations - its effects are only implicitly included through the magnitude of the saturation scale .",
    "in addition to their importance for the cronin effect , the non - factorized contributions illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : monovsclas ] likely play a significant role in determining the total gluon multiplicity as well .",
    "this can be understood by comparing the numerical results for the gluon liberation coefficient @xmath54  @xcite which give @xmath55 , in contrast to analytical results for this coefficient that include only the factorized contributions and is roughly 3 to 4 times larger  @xcite .",
    "a possible way of including this enhancement in the @xmath40 factorized form through quantum evolution is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a similar approximation of @xmath56 in the context of @xmath2 collisions @xcite also leads to a lack of cronin enhancement in the cross section . it would be interesting to include quantum evolution effects in addition to the cronin effect in our numerical work to quantify the importance of the energy loss contribution",
    "this work is in progress and will be reported shortly  @xcite .",
    "below , we consider @xmath2 scattering and explicitly show that inclusion of higher order scatterings leads to the cronin effect .",
    "even though the cronin effect in a high energy heavy ion collision is quite small at high @xmath1 as compared to the parton energy loss effects , it is quite important in a proton ( deuteron ) nucleus collision since energy loss effects in the hot medium produced in a heavy ion collision , are absent in a @xmath2 collision . in this section ,",
    "we re - visit the color glass condensate results for a quark or gluon scattering on a nucleus @xcite and show that the recent phenomenon of geometric scaling and changing of anomalous dimension does not affect our conclusions as long as we divide our @xmath2 cross section by its leading twist limit ( rather than @xmath5 ) .",
    "scattering of a quark or gluon on a nucleus using the color glass condensate formalism and its relation to dis was discussed in @xcite .",

    "this is the multiple scattering generalization of quark gluon scattering in pqcd and unlike the leading twist ( single scattering ) result , is finite as @xmath60 due to higher twist effects . in addition , defining @xmath61   \\label{eq : gammadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and using the fact that @xmath62 , we see that @xmath63 satisfies the following sum rule @xmath64 for fixed @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear from this sum rule that if the cross section in ( [ eq : qacs ] ) is suppressed at low @xmath1 , it must be enhanced at high @xmath1 in order to compensate for the low @xmath1 suppression so that the sum rule holds .",
    "gives the impression that there is no cronin effect .",
    "this is not the case and the @xmath66 scattering cross section , first derived there , does have the cronin enhancement . ]",
    "the cronin peak moves to higher @xmath1 as one goes to higher energy ( or more forward rapidities as well as more central collisions ) .",
    "the effects of quantum evolution on our classical results can be investigated using the renormalization group equations @xcite , and in particular the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite equation for the dipole cross section in the large @xmath67 limit .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the bk equation to the @xmath66 ( or @xmath68 ) scattering cross section in order to prove that quantum evolution preserves the sum rule in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to notice that @xmath69 at any @xmath6 ( energy ) so that the sum rule is preserved by quantum evolution and therefore , the cronin enhancement is still present .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath1 spectra will look different at different energies since the location of the cronin peak as well as its magnitude changes as one goes to higher energies ( see for example , figure @xmath70 in the last paper of @xcite . ) .",
    "in addition , the change of the anomalous dimension @xmath63 could modify the magnitude of the cronin effect .",
    "nevertheless , since the bk equation preserves the sum rule in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) at the partonic level , this modification in the high @xmath1 region will be compensated by an analogous modification in the low @xmath1 region so that the sum rule is not violated .",
    "one should keep in mind that at rhic and for mid rapidity and high @xmath1 processes ( such as the suppression of hadron yields ) the effective @xmath6 of the partons is quite large .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 gev in mid rapidity , the @xmath6 range is @xmath72 .",
    "the only potential evidence for gluon saturation and geometrical scaling in hadrons is from hera where saturation models work very well only for @xmath73 and fail at higher @xmath6 . in the case of nuclei , this effective @xmath6 may be slightly higher but can not be too much higher since otherwise , strong gluon shadowing would manifest itself in the @xmath74 structure function which shows no strong shadowing effects at the @xmath6 range @xmath75 and as a matter of fact , shows anti shadowing !",
    "the color glass condensate model is an effective theory of qcd at small @xmath6 only and likely breaks down at the high @xmath6 s relevant for high @xmath1 processes in mid rapidity at rhic .",
    "( this situation will improve as one goes to higher collision energies or stays in the low @xmath1 region . )    moving to more forward rapidities ( in the projectile fragmentation region ) will make applications of the color glass condensate model more reliable since smaller values of @xmath6 in the target are probed .",
    "the saturation scale is larger , rendering weak coupling methods more reliable .",
    "in addition , the contribution of high @xmath6 region to the cross section will be less important than that in the mid rapidity region .",
    "whether the most forward rapidities accessible at rhic are large enough for the physics of gluon saturation to be the dominant physics remains to be seen .",
    "we considered in this note gluon production in heavy ion collisions using the numerical simulations of the color glass condensate .",
    "we showed that the ratio of central to peripheral cross sections ( or equivalently , the ratio of central to pp cross sections ) , normalized by the number of collisions , shows the cronin enhancement at high @xmath1 as well the suppression at low @xmath1 .",
    "we discussed other gluon saturation and color glass condensate inspired models and commented on the absence of the cronin effect in these models .",
    "we also considered @xmath2 collisions and showed that , at the partonic level and in leading order in @xmath44 , quantum evolution with energy and the change of anomalous dimension preserves the cronin enhancement ( when normalized to its leading twist term rather than @xmath5 ) due to a sum rule satisfied by the dipole cross section even though the magnitude and location of cronin peak is energy dependent . when divided by the @xmath5",
    "cross section as done experimentally , our ratio will have suppression at high @xmath1 in agreement with the results of ref .  @xcite . after this work was completed , we were made aware of similar work by kharzeev , kovchegov and tuchin  @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that the numerical solution of the classical @xmath0 yang - mills equations of motion in the mclerran - venugopalan model for gluon production in central heavy ion collisions leads to a suppression at low @xmath1 and an enhancement at the intermediate @xmath1 region as compared to peripheral heavy ion and pp collisions at the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared to previous , color glass condensate inspired calculations of gluon production in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the predictions of the color glass condensate model for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) collisions in leading order and show that quantum evolution  in particular the phenomenon of geometric scaling and change of anomalous dimensions  preserves the cronin enhancement of @xmath2 cross section ( when normalized to the leading twist term ) in the leading order approximation even though the @xmath1 spectrum can change . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the case when gluon radiation is included . </S>"
