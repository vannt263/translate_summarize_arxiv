    "quantum decoherence @xcite is mainly induced by the interaction of a microscopic system coupled with its environment .",
    "the system - environment coupling results in a non - unitary evolution of the system , which destroys the purity of quantum states and leads to information loss toward the environment .",
    "these issues have attracted much attention in the study of quantum computation and quantum communication in recent years @xcite .",
    "some investigations of quantum decoherence have been focused on the measurement induced decoherence @xcite , and the dynamical controls of the decoherence @xcite .",
    "for the implementation of realistic quantum information processors , these investigations become the most champion works in the field . in the solid - state quantum computer with charge qubits , quantum measurement of the qubit states",
    "can be performed by coupling the charge qubit with a sensitive electrometer such as quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) @xcite or a single - electron transistor @xcite . in this paper , we shall focus on the charge qubit measurement using a qpc , and study the non - equilibrium dynamical effect of the qpc on the decoherence of the qubit states , here the charge qubit is a single electron confined in coupled quantum dots ( cqd ) .",
    "literaturely , to study the quantum decoherence induced by quantum measurements , an equilibrium approximation is applied to the reservoir state @xcite .",
    "for example , in the study of a charge qubit measured by a qpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the electronic reservoir , the source and the drain of the qpc , is assumed to be macroscopic enough in comparison with the cqd .",
    "then the thermal equilibrium of the reservoir is kept continuously through rapid relaxation processes .",
    "this condition of a perfect heat bath causes electrons tunneling such that the extra electrons arriving at the drain will flow back rapidly into the source through a close loop of the transport circuit .",
    "no extra electron accumulates in the steady reservoir .",
    "practically , however , the condition of the perfect heat bath is not guaranteed at mesoscopic scale of the qpc . the electron accumulation ( ea ) in the source and the drain of the qpc",
    "may destroy the equilibrium of reservoir and influence the outcome of the electrometer . as a result",
    ", the effects of ea may become significant to the decoherence of the measured qubit . in this paper",
    ", we shall treat approximately this intermediate non - equilibrium effect as a perturbation to the equilibrium reservoir .",
    "the quantum decoherence of the charge qubit due to the ea is then studied within this framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model of the charge qubit measurement and the perturbation scheme of taking the ea effect into account are presented in sec .",
    "ii . a set of master equations for the reduced density operator of the qubit",
    "is also derived in this section . in sec .",
    ", the quantum decoherence of the qubit in the thermal equilibrium limit is illuminated according to the resultant master equations",
    ". an abnormal dependence of the qubit decay mode to the temperature and bias voltage is obtained . the ea effect on the quantum decoherence of the qubit states",
    "is explored in sec .",
    "the dynamics of the ea is analyzed , and the ea induced decoherence of the qubit is extensively discussed .",
    "remarkably , we also found a decoherenceless ea effect in the low temperature regime .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "the model we consider here is a single electron confined in a cqd ( as a charge qubit ) that is measured by the qpc detector , see fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system is given by @xcite @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the hamiltonian of the charge qubit in which @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators of the electron sited in the two dots labelled by @xmath4 and @xmath5 as shown in fig .",
    "they satisfy the condition @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the electron tunneling amplitude between the two dots .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the hamiltonian of the qpc reservoir , which is decomposed into two terms for the source and the drain , respectively , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the corresponding electron creation ( annihilation ) operators . since the presence of an electron in a dot close proximity to the qpc will cause a variation in barrier of the qpc , @xmath11 , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 describes the coupling of the quantum dots and the qpc in close proximity to the dot @xmath5 .",
    "the information of the qubit - states can then be read out through the qpc current @xcite .",
    "there are two channels for electron tunneling in the qpc .",
    "one is the forward tunneling processes from the source to the drain , and the other is the backward tunneling processes from the drain to the source , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . in the high - bias regime ,",
    "magnitude of the electron tunneling rate for the forward tunneling processes is much larger than the one in the backward tunneling processes .",
    "the contribution of the backward tunneling processes could be ignored as treated in @xcite . however , in a non - equilibrium description , both contributions of the forward tunneling processes and backward tunneling processes should be included for an arbitrary bias voltage .",
    "the hilbert space is then spanned by the following basis @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an electron eigen - state in the cqd ( we define @xmath15 as the ground and excited states in the eigen - state representation , respectively ) , @xmath16 is a state with @xmath17 electrons accumulated in the drain through the forward tunneling processes , and @xmath18 a state with @xmath19 electrons accumulated in the source through the backward tunneling processes .",
    "the state @xmath20 is the reservoir ( equilibrium ) vacuum , and the operator @xmath21 denotes the annihilation of an electron from @xmath20 [ or the creation of a hole below the fermi energy of the source ( drain ) ] , while the operator @xmath22 denotes the creation of an electron above the fermi energy of the source ( drain ) .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary state of the whole system can be expressed as @xmath23    to study the charge qubit measured by the qpc , the electronic reservoir is usually assumed to be in the reservoir vacuum state ( a thermal equilibrium state ) .",
    "the reservoir vacuum state is uniquely determined for a given temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the reservoir time correlation function is usually calculated in this state .",
    "however , tunneling electrons from the forward tunneling processes will occupy the levels above the fermi energy of the drain for a short period and disturbs the reservoir vacuum state , see fig .",
    "this phenomenon , called the electron accumulation ( ea ) in qpc , should be taken into account , vice versa for the backward tunneling processes . meanwhile ,",
    "the ea may also be induced by the impurity of the reservoir or a circuit with a worse transport mobility ( the imperfect condition of the reservoir ) .",
    "literaturely , the effect of the ea is ignored @xcite .",
    "one assumes that electrons created in drain ( for the forward tunneling processes ) will be forced into the circuit instantly , no electrons are accumulated in the drain temporarily .",
    "therefore , there is no any variation to the fermi energy .",
    "the read - out current is completely contributed by the created electron of drain through the circuit , as a result in the macroscopic limit .",
    "however , for a mesoscopic reservoir , a variation of the fermi energy can be generated by the ea .",
    "it is certainly interesting to study what the influence of the ea effect is on the decoherence of the measured qubit .",
    "in general , the ea should be considered by treating the reservoir as a fully non - equilibrium system .",
    "however , the reservoir is indeed an asymptotic stationary state at mesoscopic scale .",
    "this is because the external bias can be regarded as a bigger macroscopic reservoir compared with the qpc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the external bias forces the qpc reservoir to evolve into an asymptotic stationary state in a short period .",
    "for such a case , we can treat approximately the intermediate non - equilibrium effect as a perturbation to the equilibrium reservoir .",
    "thus , the ea can be described simply by a variation of the chemical potentials in the source and the drain . in the forward tunneling processes ,",
    "the tunneling of @xmath17 electrons moved from the source to the drain results in an effective increase of the chemical potential in the drain @xmath24 and an effective decrease of the chemical potential in the source @xmath25 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . here , @xmath26 is the inverse temperature . in thermal equilibrium state ,",
    "the electron distributions obey fermi - dirac function @xmath27 for the source and @xmath28 for the drain .",
    "obviously , at a given temperature , the chemical potential determines the number density of electrons @xmath29 in reservoir .",
    "the relation of its inverse function can be solved . furthermore , because the qpc is a 2-dimensional electron gas , the density of states , @xmath30 , for the source ( @xmath31 for the drain ) can be assumed to be energy independent @xcite .",
    "then the chemical potential can be expressed as @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the variation due to the ea is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the area of the qpc .",
    "one can find that up to the first order of @xmath35 , @xmath36    in addition , the bias effect on the ea should be taken into account .",
    "the external bias and the qpc - dots interaction determine electron tunnelings in the qpc .",
    "the current partially induced by the qpc - dots interaction records the qubit information .",
    "the bias effect simply forces the reservoir into a local equilibrium state .",
    "that is , the fluctuation of the chemical potential arisen from the qpc - dots interaction will be suppressed by the bias effect asymptotically , @xmath37 .",
    "the ea should decay to vanish ( a electron - release process , er for short ) by the bias effect .",
    "this er process is also associated with the imperfect condition of the reservoir . to simplify the problem , the stochastic ea process ( also including the effects of the bias and qpc - dots interaction ) is assumed to be described by @xmath38 the exponential decay factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : verls ] ) comes from the bias effect .",
    "the detailed expression of the er decay rate @xmath39 depends on the imperfect condition of the qpc associated with the bias effect . in general , @xmath40 are functions of the tunneling electron number @xmath17 , and are different for the forward tunneling processes and backward tunneling processes .",

    "( [ eq : verls ] ) describes properly the stochastic nature of the tunneling processes embedded in the er process and the cyclic motion of the external transport circuit .",
    "obviously , the magnitude of the chemical potential variation decays to zero as the reservoir approaches to the local equilibrium state , namely , @xmath46 .",
    "similar to the forward tunneling processes , the tunneling of @xmath19 electrons moved from the drain to the source for the backward tunneling processes leads to the chemical potential decreasing @xmath47 in the drain and increasing @xmath48 in the source .",

    "however , we shall focus in this paper on the tunneling transparency regime ( the weak dot - qpc coupling ) .",

    "the second order cummulant expansion technique @xcite is used . here",
    ", the markovian approximation has been introduced in the technique .",
    "it should be noted that since the electron tunneling in the qpc is determined by the external bias and the qpc - dots interaction , it results in the qubit dynamics with three time scales : the qubit decoherence time , the er decay time due to the electron release by the bias , and the correction time due to the qpc - dots interaction associated with the bias , temperature and the electron accumulation . in literature , the validity of the markovian approximation could depend on the time scale of the correlation time @xcite .",
