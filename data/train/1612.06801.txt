    "such functions are known to exist ; however , the form of such an @xmath4 is only known explicitly for a number of special cases of @xmath3 .",
    "knotted functions are not only of mathematical interest , but are important for physical applications ; in recent years such functions @xmath4 have been the basis of explicit knotted structures embedded in physical fields , even admitting experimental realization .    in 1928 , brauner found a simple set of functions with zeros in the form of torus knots and links @xcite ( in an approach popularised by milnor @xcite ) , and later perron @xcite , rudolph @xcite and dennis et al .",
    "@xcite found examples of @xmath4 with @xmath3 as the figure - eight knot and its higher - periodic generalizations : the link of three borromean rings @xmath5 ( also referred to as @xmath6 ) , the knots @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc .",
    "the standard knot table @xcite begins with the trefoil knot @xmath9 ( a torus knot ) , followed by the figure - eight knot @xmath10 and the cinquefoil knot @xmath11 ( another torus knot ) and then the three - twist knot @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the simplest knot @xmath3 for which there is no known @xmath12 is @xmath0 . here , we construct such an @xmath13 explicitly ( equations ( [ eq : fa ] ) , ( [ eq : f5_2 ] ) below , whose nodal knot is plotted in figure [ fig:5_2 ] ) , exemplifying a general method which explicitly generates @xmath14 with a nodal set isotopic to any knot or link @xmath3 ; we describe the general proofs of this method in @xcite .",
    "the knot @xmath0 is distinguished as the simplest non - fibred knot ; for a knot @xmath3 which is not fibred , the complement @xmath15 can not be represented as a fibre bundle over the base space @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 is fibred , a function @xmath4 might provide an explicit fibration provided the derivative @xmath17 everywhere , where the fibres are the surfaces of constant argument @xmath18 . in this case , the surfaces of constant argument ( phase ) are seifert surfaces , whose boundary is the knot .",
    "since @xmath0 is not fibred , there must be critical points of @xmath19 in @xmath20 , in the sense that @xmath21 at them .",
    "the level set of constant @xmath22 at these points is not a 2-surface  our explicit @xmath13 therefore allows us to explore an example in detail of how knots can fail to be fibred .",
    "brauner s knot functions have a very simple form , in terms of complex coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 , of the unit 3-sphere @xmath25 . if @xmath26 denotes the @xmath27 torus knot or link with @xmath28 , the complex polynomial @xmath29 has a zero set @xmath30 , as explained in detail at the beginning of @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the hopf link has @xmath31 and the trefoil knot has @xmath32 .",
    "these functions are also holomorphic in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and it is straightforward to generalize them to include cables of torus knots @xcite .",
    "rudolph s map for the figure - eight knot @xmath33 , on the other hand , is of the kind @xmath34 , which we call _ semiholomorphic _ : @xmath35 is holomorphic in @xmath23 , but depends on both @xmath24 and its conjugate @xmath36 .",
    "the functions introduced by brauner , perron and rudolph were not motivated by finding explicit knotted functions on a 3-dimensional manifold like @xmath20 , but rather to understand the properties of isolated singularities of more general maps @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "both brauner s maps @xmath38 and rudolph s @xmath39 have a singularity ( i.e.  a critical point where @xmath40 ) at the origin in @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , such that the intersection of the zero sets @xmath43 with any 3-sphere of sufficiently small radius gives @xmath3 .",
    "akbulut and king @xcite proved non - constructively that a polynomial map exists of the form @xmath44 which has a weakly isolated singularity for any knot or link .",
    "our recent generalisation @xcite of the approach of @xcite for a different choice of @xmath45 to the family of lemniscate knots ( described below ) was similarly semiholomorphic ; the knots here only occur on restricting the polynomial in @xmath46 to the unit 3-sphere ( and other radii close to @xmath47 ) and not necessarily to 3-spheres of other radii , and at best have weakly isolated singularities in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the lemniscate knot construction and its generalizations @xcite are , however , highly suited as candidates for embedding knots into physical fields in a range of physical systems , generalizing brauner s maps for torus knots .",
    "of course , physical systems are more usually defined in three - dimensional cartesian space than @xmath20 , but the function @xmath48 can be generalised to @xmath49 using standard stereographic coordinates @xmath50 where @xmath51 are cartesian coordinates , and @xmath52 are cylindrical polar coordinates which we will often find more useful in discussing the construction .",
    "any explicit representation of a knot must start with a way of encoding the knot s conformation uniquely ; our construction of @xmath13 , as with the other knotted field functions discussed is based on a braid representation , of which the knot is the closure .",
    "the torus knot @xmath26 is the closure of a @xmath53-strand helix which rotates by @xmath54 turns before closing ; a figure - eight knot is the closure of a 3-strand pigtail braid after it undergoes two periods ( and hence four crossings ) of its characteristic over - under pattern . in terms of the artin braid group @xcite",
    ", a braid of @xmath55 strands has @xmath56 generators @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath57 represents an overcrossing between the @xmath59th and @xmath60th strands , and @xmath61 for each @xmath59 , and other generators commute .",
    "the torus knot @xmath62 is therefore represented by the braid word @xmath63 ; the figure - eight knot by @xmath64 ( and higher powers @xmath65 for higher periods of the knot , such as @xmath66 for @xmath5 , @xmath67 for @xmath7 and @xmath68 for @xmath8 ) .",
    "the lemniscate knots are a large family of knots and links including the torus knots and figure - eight knot , given by closures of braids that can be parametrized trigonometrically as follows .",
    "positive integers @xmath69 ( with @xmath55 , @xmath70 coprime ) are chosen so @xmath70 determines a @xmath71 lissajous figure @xmath72 in the form of a generalized lemniscate with respect to @xmath73 , @xmath74 the factor @xmath75 is chosen so when @xmath76 this is a lemniscate of gerono . the @xmath77-_lemniscate knot _",
    "@xmath78 is the closure of the braid @xmath79 as the braid length parameter @xmath80 increases , the @xmath55 strands of the braid execute the path @xmath72 in the transverse plane of the braid , perpendicular to the direction of increase of @xmath80 .",
    "the strands are distributed equally around the curve @xmath72 ( with respect to its parametrization by @xmath80 ) , and @xmath55 and @xmath70 must be coprime to ensure the strands never intersect . as @xmath80 increases from @xmath81",
    "to @xmath82 , each strand makes its way @xmath83 around @xmath72 ; as @xmath84 , the strands are cyclically permuted , @xmath85 .",
    "one can read off the braid word by drawing the two - dimensional braid diagram in the @xmath86 plane , where crossing signs are found from @xmath87 ; by ( [ eq : genlem ] ) , when @xmath88 , @xmath89 all crossings labelled by an odd generator occur , with all even generators at at @xmath90 .",
    "the word therefore has the form @xmath91 , where the signs @xmath92 for @xmath93 are determined by the sign of @xmath94 at @xmath80 evaluated at integer multiples of @xmath95 , corresponding to the crossings .",
    "it is therefore clear that the torus knot / link @xmath26 is represented in this way by @xmath96 , and @xmath10 by @xmath97 ( higher - period generalizations have higher values of @xmath98 ) .",
    "the rest of the construction follows by encoding the braid into a family of polynomials @xmath99 , which have , for each @xmath80 , roots at @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 real nonzero scaling factors .",
    "multiplying the polynomial out and using simple arithmetic of roots of unity , it can be shown that @xmath99 is a polynomial in @xmath104 ( i.e.  no fractional powers of the exponential ) .",
    "one finds a function @xmath105 by replacing @xmath106 and @xmath107 in this polynomial expression ; for sufficiently small @xmath102 and @xmath103 , this function is indeed @xmath108 , and is automatically a semiholomorphic polynomial .",
    "the trigonometry of the braid function has thus been replaced by algebra in the polynomial .",
    "of course , not all knots are in the lemniscate family ( in fact all lemniscate knots are fibred since the lemniscate braid representation is homogeneous @xcite ) : more complicated functions are needed to realize braid representations of other knots . a convenient  although by no means unique  braid representative for a knot or link is its minimal braid representation @xcite , defined as the shortest braid word closing to the knot ( which may be longer than the knot s crossing number , and also is not necessarily unique ) . for @xmath0 ,",
    "this is given by the word of length @xmath109 with two generators , @xmath110 ; the braid word @xmath111 is not homogeneous ",
    "both @xmath112 and @xmath113 occur @xcite .    in order to find @xmath13 ,",
    "it is natural to generalize the lemniscate knot construction ; we must find a pair of trigonometric functions @xmath114 which encode the minimal braid word @xmath111 in the same way that @xmath115 encode the lemniscate knot s braid word .",
    "after encoding the braid into a polynomial in @xmath46 , we must find a suitable choice for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we will go through these steps explicitly in detail , to illustrate various features of the construction .",
    "the braid functions are found by inspection , using simple finite fourier series instead of ( [ eq : genlem ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the function on different scaling factors is described in some numerical detail , which depends on critical points of the absolute value @xmath116 .",
    "these are distinct from the critical points of phase ( i.e.  argument ) @xmath22 , whose existence is related to the failure of @xmath0 to be fibred , and these also can easily be located numerically .",
    "we will also describe how the @xmath13 we construct can not easily be generalized to a function with an isolated singularity .",
    "finally , we consider similar construction of functions with nodal knots for other knots of six and fewer crossings . before proceeding , however , we will briefly survey the various physical systems in which knotted fields such as @xmath13 might be of relevance .",
    "there is much interest , going back to kelvin @xcite , in studying the evolution of vortex knots in fluids ( either classical or superfluid ) @xcite , and this construction provides natural phase functions whose gradient describes the velocity pattern around a knotted vortex .",
    "the construction in @xcite gives a precise prescription to create a classical knotted flow field based on a complex scalar function @xmath4 with a nodal knot ; this has the additional feature that , since the underlying complex function is semiholomorphic , the helicity of the flow can be chosen to be any integer multiple of the number of strands in the construction of the knot .",
    "electromagnetic fields with knotted magnetic field lines can also be constructed by an analogous construction @xcite .",
    "vortex lines , as nodal lines of a complex scalar field , also occur in quantum eigenfunctions , and can be designed to be knotted and linked @xcite ; so far brauner s functions , or others , have not been embedded into stationary eigenfunctions of a quantum system .",
    "it is known that knotted nodal lines exist in the nodal sets of generic eigenfunctions in simple quantum systems such as the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator or hydrogen atom @xcite , but these knots are components of densely linked tangles , and not the isolated nodal sets considered here . propagating , coherent optical fields satisfy the paraxial wave equation , which is the @xmath117 schrdinger s equation ( the third propagation direction corresponds to time ) ; with the @xmath118 section of a brauner function or a figure - eight generalization , the propagating field also has a nodal knot as realised experimentally in @xcite .",
    "complex scalar functions are also useful in describing reaction - diffusion systems ( such as in chemical waves ) in which the zeros are organizing centres , and knots have been studied in such systems mathematically @xcite .",
    "physical systems described by other target spaces can have knotted fields based on nodal sets of complex scalar functions .",
    "one such example is topological solitons ( described by maps from the three - sphere to the two - sphere ) , in which complex function - based rational maps have been successful as anstze for low - lying energy states in the skyrme - faddeev model @xcite .",
    "stationary configurations of energy are known for this model to take the form of torus knots , cable knots and links @xcite , but at present no other knots have been found ; an initial ansatz with the topology of some other knot ( such as @xmath0 ) can be made following the description in @xcite .",
    "liquid crystals are another class of systems area in which knotted defects can be created and controlled @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility for knotted defects is in smectic liquid crystals , whose low - energy configurations are in layers of material naturally represented by the complex argument of a complex scalar field , and in which realisations of fibred knots @xcite seem most natural . understanding how smooth phase fields break down for non - fibred knots is then of particular interest in these systems .",
    "we seek explicit functions @xmath114 for the three - twist knot @xmath0 such that the braid @xmath119 is a representation of its minimal braid word @xmath120 . as discussed above ,",
    "if the two - dimensional braid diagram is represented in the @xmath121 plane , the function @xmath122 encodes only the sequence of generators and not their signs , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 on a generator denotes an intersection of strands whose crossing sign @xmath125 is undetermined .",
    "it is convenient to place the first crossing @xmath126 at @xmath127 .",
    "this 3-strand braid ( without crossing signs ) is represented as a piecewise - linear graph with respect to @xmath128 $ ] in figure [ fig : interpolation ] ( a ) , where strands and crossings are labelled increasing from the top left downwards . upon closure",

    "the two sinusoidal components should have most interference around @xmath142 and @xmath143 , so spatial frequency @xmath144 appears suitable .",
    "therefore a two - term fourier series , with appropriately chosen amplitude , is sufficient to define @xmath122 , @xmath145 which is plotted in figure [ fig : interpolation ] ( c ) and ( d ) analogous to the piecewise linear representation of ( a ) and ( b ) .",

    "the process of finding a suitable @xmath122 requires following the strands , rather than braid algebra which depends simply on the crossings .    the function @xmath153 is chosen in a similar way ; it should be a simple fourier series correctly encoding the crossing signs .",

    "our focus in this paper has been finding the complex function @xmath13 for the three - twist knot @xmath0 , the simplest knot not previously found as a nodal knot for an explicit complex map .",
    "however , the procedure can be easily extended to any knot or link via chosen braid representation ; we now summarize examples of knots and links with 6 and fewer crossings not described by previous discussions .",
    "as described in the introduction , all of the knots of five or fewer crossings except @xmath0 have been described previously , as they are either torus knots ( and hence functions constructed by brauner s method @xcite ) or @xmath10 which is a lemniscate knot @xcite .",
    "the 6-crossing knots include the prime knots @xmath306 ( the stevedore s knot ) , @xmath307 and @xmath308 , and the two composite @xmath309 ( the granny knot ) and @xmath310 ( the square knot ) .",

    "the trajectory and nodal set of @xmath316 at @xmath247 are shown in figure [ fig : extras ] ( a ) .",
    "the minimal braid word for the stevedore knot is more complicated , having @xmath317 strands : @xmath318 ( which is a simple markov conjugation away from the standard minimal form @xcite ) . the corresponding unsigned word is rather symmetric ( placing the adjacent @xmath319 at the same value of @xmath80 ) , and a suitable function @xmath153 is @xmath320 .",

    "the parameter value @xmath247 was chosen .",
    ", width=536 ]    we conclude this section by considering an example of a link , namely the whitehead link ( @xmath329 in the thistlethwaite table @xcite , @xmath330 in the rolfsen table @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure for links follows the same argument as for knots ; each component of the link is comprised of a subset of the braid s strands .",
    "the minimal braid for the whitehead link has five crossings and three strands , with minimal word is @xmath331 .",
    "here , strands @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the same component , with a single occurrence of their generator : the trajectory of this component is a simple loop . the other loop winds around this one , in a lemniscate - like trajectory .",
    "a choice of the trajectory pair making the whitehead link is therefore the following : @xmath332 the trajectory and nodal set of @xmath333 at @xmath247 are shown in figure [ fig : extras ] ( d ) . a simple way of creating functions with nodal links is by multiplying functions whose nodal set is each component loop of the link , so the braid construction for knots is less necessary for constructing functions with nodal links .",
    "not all link functions will factorize in this way , and in fact the example @xmath333 here does not .",
    "there are six 6-crossing prime links , of which two are lemniscate ( @xmath334 is the torus link @xmath335 and @xmath5 is the borromean rings ) ; braid functions for the others are straightforward ( albeit tedious ) to derive , and we omit them here .",
    "we have described a construction of a function from a the unit three - sphere or three - dimensional cartesian space to the complex numbers whose nodal set is the three - twist knot @xmath0 , with an approach based on a braid representative that can be extended ( with sufficient patience ) to any knot or link .",
    "the same @xmath122 function was used with a different @xmath153 to make the @xmath307 knot , but other generalizations are possible ; a simple further case is to take two copies of the braid word before closing , equivalent to replacing every occurrence of @xmath24 and @xmath36 in ( [ eq : fa ] ) with @xmath336 and @xmath337 .",
    "the knot corresponding to the closure of @xmath338 is the 12-crossing knot @xmath339 @xcite .",
    "the procedure described here to find the correct braid trajectory was focused on getting the simplest possible fourier series ( based on number of terms , rational simplicity of coefficients and low orders of spatial frequencies ) .",
    "the resulting polynomial ( [ eq : fa ] ) was comparatively small , and had integer coefficients ; these properties might be desirable , but are not necessary .",
    "in particular , the nodal knot will be structurally stable to small perturbations of the coefficients , and indeed such a perturbation might lead to a conformation of the knot with better - separated strands @xcite .",
    "it is not immediately obvious whether more careful choices of the fourier series for the trajectory may give a simpler polynomial function as an alternative to @xmath190 ; as a polynomial , the order in the holomorphic parameter is equal to the number of strands @xmath55 of the braid representation , and the order of @xmath24 , @xmath36 is the highest order of @xmath340 is the trajectory fourier series .",
    "we expect the maximum value of the parameter @xmath102 at which the knot appears to depend on the order of the fourier series , as well as the maximum distance of the trajectory from the origin ; for instance , for the alternative @xmath153 function mentioned at the end of section [ sec : braid ] , the knot only appeared for @xmath341 , somewhat smaller than the function considered here ( and therefore with the knot correspondingly closer to the unit circle ) .",
    "it may be more practical for more complicated to make the process of determining the braid word more algorithmic , and in @xcite we describe such an algorithm based on trigonometric interpolation which can be applied a braid word for any knot or link ; this algorithm , applied to @xmath0 , gives fourier series for @xmath122 and @xmath153 with real valued non - integer coefficients of six and eleven terms respectively , going up to order @xmath342 .",
    "being a complex scalar functions , it is natural to ask whether @xmath250 might be realised in a scalar quantum wavefunction . indeed , despite not being normalizable , one could take @xmath250 and evolve it in time according to the free schrdinger equation directly ( the time - dependent wavefunction also being a polynomial ) . as with other similar constructions",
    ", however , the nodal set evolves , undergoing several reconnections after which the knot dissolves .",
    "it is less easy to identify a system ( e.g.  specified by a potential ) in which a wavefunction involving @xmath13 is a time - independent eigenfunction .",
    "although it is possible to constructed certain torus links in nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom @xcite , most functions of brauner form are incompatible with the symmetries of the potential @xcite .",
    "it may appear more hopeful to consider @xmath0 as optical vortices in a propagating laser beam , extending @xcite , by taking the polynomial @xmath343 in ( [ eq : f5_2 ] ) as an initial condition ( hologram plane ) for paraxial evolution @xcite .",
    "preliminary investigation , however , fails to give an optical vortex @xmath0 knot for any value of @xmath102 , and ongoing investigations are attempting to understanding this more deeply .",
    "it should be possible to embed @xmath13 ( or a perturbation ) into the initial conditions for many other physical systems as discussed in section [ sec : int ] , such as ( super)fluids , reaction - diffusion systems , skyrme - faddeev topological solitons and liquid crystals .",
    "the resulting dynamics of the resulting knotted fields would be more complicated than simple linear schrdinger evolution ; it would be interesting to study these systems in more detail , to understand whether the evolution of different knots such as @xmath0 have special physics , possibly related to knot - theoretic properties such as being fibred .",
