    "herding behavior and the formation of speculative bubbles ( and subsequent crashes ) are observed in many financial and commodity markets .",
    "there are many historical examples , from the so - called dutch tulip bulb mania in 1637 to the recent credit crunch in the us housing market in 2007 . despite the obvious importance of these phenomena , herding behavior and bubble formation",
    "were investigated in the scientific literature only in the last two decades .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose and investigate a kinetic model describing irrationality and herding of market agents , motivated by the works of toscani @xcite and delitala and lorenzi @xcite .",
    "herding in economic markets is characterized by a homogenization of the actions of the market participants , which behave at a certain time in the same way .",
    "herding may lead to strong trends with low volatility of asset prices , but eventually also to abrupt corrections , so it promotes the occurence of bubbles and crashes .",
    "numerous socio - economic papers @xcite and research in biological sciences @xcite show that herding interactions play a crucial role in social scenarios .",
    "herding behavior is driven by emotions and usually occurs because of the social pressure of conformity .",
    "another cause is the appeal to belief that it is unlikey that a large number of people could be wrong .",
    "a market participant might follow the herd in spite of another opinion .",
    "this phenomenon is known as an information cascade @xcite .",
    "while most approaches to herding in the literature are based on agent models , our approach uses techniques from kinetic theory , similar to opinion - formation models @xcite .",
    "these methods employ ideas from statistical mechanics to describe the behavior of a large number of individuals in a society @xcite .",
    "binary collisions between gas molecules are replaced by interactions of market individuals , and the phase - space variables are interpreted as socio - economic variables , in our case : the rationality @xmath0 and the estimated asset value @xmath1 , assigned to the asset by an individual .",
    "when @xmath2 , we say that the agent behaves rational , otherwise irrational .",
    "we refer to the review @xcite for a discussion of rational herding models .    denoting by @xmath3 the distribution of the agents at time @xmath4 , its time evolution is given by the inhomogenous boltzmann - type equation @xmath5 with the boundary condition @xmath6 at @xmath7 and initial condition @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes an interaction that is soley based on economic fundamentals . after the interaction ,",
    "the individuals change their estimated asset value influenced by sources of public information such as financial reports , balance sheet numbers , etc .",
    "the second term describes binary interactions of the agents modeling the exchange of information and possibly leading to herding and imitation phenomena .    when the asset value lies within a certain range around the `` fair '' prize , determined by fundamentals",
    ", the agents may suffer from psychological biases like overconfidence and limited attention @xcite , and we assume that they behave more irrational .",
    "this means that the drift field @xmath10 is negative in that range .",
    "when the asset value becomes too low or too large compared to the `` fair '' prize the asset values are believed to be driven by speculation .",
    "we assume that the market agents recognize this fact at a certain point and are becoming more rational . in this case",
    ", the drift field @xmath10 is positive .",
    "we expect that the estimated asset value will in average be not too far from the `` fair '' price , and we confirm this expectation by computing the moment of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath11 in section [ sec.be ] .",
    "for details on the modeling , we refer to section [ sec.mod ] .",
    "our setting is influenced by the models investigated by toscani @xcite and delitala and lorenzi @xcite .",
    "toscani @xcite described the interaction of individuals in the context of opinion formation .",
    "our modeling of public information and herding is similar to @xcite .",
    "the idea to include public information and herding is due to @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we allow for the drift field @xmath10 , leading to the inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation .",
    "such equations were also studied in @xcite but using a different drift field .",
    "the relationship of rational herd behavior and asset values was investigated in @xcite but no dynamics were analyzed .",
    "the novelty of the present work is the combination of dynamics , transport , public information , and herding .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "we derive formally in the grazing collision limit ( as in @xcite ) the nonlinear fokker - planck equation @xmath12g)_w + ( h(w)g)_w + ( d(w)g)_{ww } , \\\\    & g(x,0,t ) = 0 , \\quad g(x , w,0 ) = g_0(x , w ) ,       \\quad ( x , w)\\in { { \\mathbb r}}\\times{{\\mathbb r}}^+,\\ t>0 .",

    "again , we refer to section [ sec.mod ] for details .",
    "a different herding diffusion model in the context of crowd motion was derived and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "other kinetic and macroscopic crowd models were considered in @xcite .",
    "equation is nonlinear , nonlocal , degenerate in @xmath11 , and anisotropic in @xmath17 ( incomplete diffusion ) .",
    "it is well known that partial diffusion may lead to singularity formation @xcite , and often the existence of solutions can be shown only in the class of very weak or entropy solutions @xcite . our situation is better than in @xcite , since the transport in @xmath17 is linear . exploiting the linear structure , we prove the existence of global _ weak _ solutions to -",
    ". however , we need the assumption that @xmath15 is strictly positive to get rid of the degeneracy in @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , our estimates depend on @xmath18 and become useless when @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we present some numerical experiments for the inhomogeneous boltzmann - type equation using a splitting scheme .",
    "the collisional part ( i.e.   with @xmath19 ) is approximated using the interaction rules and a modified bird scheme .",
    "the transport part ( i.e.   with @xmath20 ) is discretized using a combination of an upwind and lax - wendroff scheme .",
    "the numerical experiments highlight the importance of the reliability of public information in the formation of bubbles and crashes .",
    "the use of bollinger bands in the simulations shows how herding may lead to strong trends with low volatility of the asset prices , but eventually also to abrupt corrections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.mod ] ,",
    "the kinetic model is detailed and the grazing collision limit is performed .",
    "the resulting fokker - planck model - is analyzed in section [ sec.anal ] .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the time evolution of the moments of @xmath21 in some specific examples .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ sec.num ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to model the evolution of the distribution of the number of agents in a large market using a kinetic approach .",
    "we describe the behavior of the market agents by means of microscopic interactions among the agents .",
    "the state of the market is assumed to be characterized by two continuous variables : the estimated asset value @xmath1 and the rationality @xmath0 .",
    "we say that the agent has a rational behavior if @xmath2 and an irrational behavior if @xmath22 . the changes in asset valuation",
    "are based on binary interactions .",
    "we take into account two different types : the interaction with public sources , which characterizes a rational agent , and the effect of herding , characterizing an irrational agent . in the following , we define the corresponding interaction rules .",
    "let @xmath11 be the estimated asset value of an arbitrary agent before the interaction and @xmath23 the asset value after exchanging information with the public source .",
    "given the background @xmath24 , which may be interpreted as a `` fair '' value , the interaction is given , similarly as in @xcite , by @xmath25 the function @xmath26 measures the compromise propensity and takes values in @xmath27 $ ] , and the parameter @xmath28 is a measure of the strength of this effect .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath29 with values in @xmath27 $ ] describes the modification of the asset value due to diffusion , and @xmath30 is a random variable with distribution @xmath31 with variance @xmath32 and zero mean taking values on @xmath33 , i.e.@xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "an example for @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the characteristic function on the set @xmath39 .",
    "thus , if the estimated asset value is too far from the value available from public sources ( the `` fair '' value ) , the effect of public information will be discarded ( selective perception ) .",
    "the idea behind is that if a market agent trusts an information source , she will update her estimated asset value to make it closer to the one suggested by the public information .",
    "we expect that a rational investor follows such a strategy .",
    "the interaction rule has to ensure that the post - interaction value @xmath23 remains in the interval @xmath40 .",
    "we have to require that diffusion vanishes at the border @xmath7 , i.e.  @xmath41 . in the absence of diffusion",
    ", it follows that @xmath42 if @xmath43 and @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , the post - interaction value @xmath23 stays in the domain @xmath40 .",
    "the second interaction rule aims to model the effect of herding , i.e. , we take into account the interaction between a market agent and other investors .",
    "we suggest the interaction rule , similarly as in @xcite , @xmath46 the pairs @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the asset values of two arbitrary agents before and after the interaction , respectively . in ,",
    "@xmath49 $ ] is a constant which measures the attitude of the market participants to change their mind because of herding mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , @xmath50 , @xmath51 are random variables , modeling diffusion effects , with the same distribution with variance @xmath52 and zero mean , and , to simplify , the function @xmath29 is the same as in .",
    "the function @xmath53 with values in @xmath27 $ ] describes a socio - economic scenario where individuals are highly confident in the asset .",
    "an example , taken from @xcite , reads as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is nonincreasing , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "if an agent has an asset value @xmath11 smaller than @xmath58 , the function @xmath53 will push this agent to assume a higher value @xmath23 than that one before the interaction .",
    "this means that the agent trusts other agents that assign a higher value .",
    "if @xmath11 is larger than @xmath58 , the agent hesitates to lower his asset value and nothing changes .",
    "agents that assign a small value @xmath11 tend to herd with a higher rate , i.e.  @xmath55 is nonincreasing .",
    "another choice is given by @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "in this case , the interaction occurs only when the two interacting agents have asset values which are not too different from each other",
    ".    the interaction does not take place if @xmath23 , @xmath60 are negative . in the absence of diffusion , adding both equations in gives @xmath61 which means that the total momentum is conserved . subtracting both equations in yields @xmath62 . since @xmath63 ( observe that @xmath64 ) , the post - interaction difference @xmath65 in the asset values is smaller than the pre - interaction difference @xmath66 .",
    "we infer that @xmath23 , @xmath60 remain nonnegative .",
    "when diffusion is taken into account , we need to specify the range of values the random variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 in can assume .",
    "this clearly depends on the choice of @xmath67 , and we refer to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .      instead of calculating the value @xmath17 and @xmath11 for each market agent , we prefer to investigate the evolution of the distribution @xmath3 of the estimated value and the rationality of the market participants .",
    "the integral @xmath68 with @xmath69 represents the number of agents with asset value and rationality in @xmath70 at time @xmath4 . in analogy with classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases",
    ", we may identify the position variable with the rationality and the velocity with the asset value . using standard methods of kinetic theory",
    ", @xmath3 evolves according to the inhomogeneous boltzmann equation @xmath71 here , @xmath10 is the drift term , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are interaction integrals modeling the public information and herding , respectively , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 describe the interaction frequencies .",
    "this equation is supplemented by the boundary condition @xmath76 ( nobody believes that the asset has value zero ) and the initial condition @xmath77 for @xmath78 .    a simple model for @xmath79 can be introduced as follows .",
    "if an agent gives an asset value that is much larger than the `` fair '' value @xmath80 , she will recognize that the value is overestimated and it is believed that she will become more rational .",
    "the same holds true when the estimated value is too low compared to @xmath80 . in this regime",
    ", the drift function @xmath10 should be positive since agents drift towards higher rationality @xmath2 .",
    "when the estimated value is not too far from the value @xmath80 , agents may behave more irrational and drift towards the region @xmath22 , so the drift function is negative .",
    "an example for such a function is @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the constant @xmath85 fixes the range @xmath86 in which bubbles and crashes do not occur .",
    "more realistic models are obtained when @xmath85 depends on time , and we consider such a case in section [ sec.num ] ) .",
    "an alternative is to employ the mean asset value @xmath87 instead of @xmath11 in @xmath86 to distinguish the ranges .",
    "next , we detail the choice of the interaction integrals . as pointed out in @xcite , the existence of a pre - interaction pair which returns the post - interaction pair @xmath48 through an interaction of the type",
    "is not guaranteed , because of the boundary constraint .",
    "therefore , we will give the interaction rule in the weak form .",
    "let @xmath88 be a regular test function and set @xmath89 , @xmath69 .",
    "the weak form reads as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the expectation value with respect to the random variable @xmath30 in and @xmath92 represents the fixed background satisfying @xmath93 .",
    "the boltzmann equation for this operator , @xmath94 , becomes in the weak form @xmath95 choosing @xmath96 , the right - hand side vanishes , which expresses conservation of the number of agents : @xmath97 the choice @xmath98 gives the time evolution of the mean asset value @xmath99 : @xmath100 where @xmath101 for instance , if @xmath102 and denoting by @xmath103 the ( conserved ) number of agents , we obtain @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , and @xmath106 this shows that the mean asset value converges exponentially fast to the mean value of the background as @xmath107 .    the operator @xmath108 models the binary interaction of the agents and , similary as in @xcite , we define @xmath109 where @xmath47 is the pre - interaction pair that generates via the post - interaction pair @xmath48 .",
    "choosing @xmath110 in the boltzmann equation @xmath111 , we see that this operator also conserves the number of agents .",
    "taking @xmath98 and using a symmetry argument , the interaction rule , and the fact that the random variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 have zero mean , we find that @xmath112 we infer that herding conserves the mean asset value .",
    "this is reasonable as the crowd may tend to any direction depending on the herding .",
    "the analysis of the boltzmann equation is rather involved , and it is common in kinetic theory to investigate certain asymptotics leading to simplified models of fokker - planck type . our aim is to perform the formal limit @xmath113 ( in a certain sense made precise below ) , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 appear in the interaction rules and and @xmath52 , @xmath32 are the variances of the random variables in these rules .",
