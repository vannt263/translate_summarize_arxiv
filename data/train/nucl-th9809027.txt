    "it was pointed out by hagedorn @xcite some thirty years ago that thermal models overestimate the production of anti - he@xmath7 in proton - proton collisions by seven orders of magnitude when the grand canonical ensemble is used in its standard form @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that when the number of particles as well as the interaction volume are small one has to take into account the fact that the production of anti - he@xmath7 must be accompanied by the production of another three nucleons with energy @xmath8 in order to conserve the baryon number .",
    "thus , the abundance will not be proportional to the standard boltzmann factor given by @xmath9 but to @xmath10 ^ 3\\ ] ] since three additional nucleons must be produced in order to conserve the baryon number .",
    "this suppresses the rate and introduces a cubic volume dependence .",
    "the original presentation of hagedorn has been considerably developed and expanded in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently it has become clear that a similar treatment should be followed for strangeness production in the gsi / sis energy range @xcite .",
    "this is not only due to the fact that the size of the system is small but mainly because the temperature is very low and particle numbers are small .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0-mesons is then given by @xmath11 .\\ ] ] since the strangeness must be balanced either by an anti - kaon or by a hyperon .",
    "@xmath12 are the degeneracy factors and @xmath13 the particle energies .",
    "this leads to a linear dependence of the @xmath0 density on the size of the system .",
    "such a dependence has indeed been observed by the kaos collaboration for @xmath0-mesons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to explore this idea in detail .",
    "this volume dependence can now be tested for the first time by considering the data on impact parameter dependence which are now becoming available . in section",
    "ii we review the thermal model with special emphasis on the canonical corrections due to the exact conservation of quantum numbers . in section",
    "iii we present a comparison with the experimental data from sis .",
    "one part is devoted to a systematic study of central collisions of various systems , another part to a detailed investigation of the impact - parameter dependence .",
    "the last section is devoted to a discussion of our results .",
    "the exact treatment of quantum numbers in statistical mechanics has been well established for some time now@xcite .",
    "it is in general obtained by projecting the partition function onto the desired values of the conserved charges by using the group theoretical methods ( for a review see e.g. @xcite . ) for our purpose we shall only consider the conservation laws related to the abelian u(1 ) symmetry group . in this case",
    "the formalism is particularly simple and leads to the following form of the canonical partition function for a fixed value of the conserved charge @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is obtained from the grand canonical ( gc ) partition function replacing the fugacity parameter @xmath17 by the factor @xmath18 , @xmath19 the particular form of the generating function @xmath16 in the above equation is model dependent .",
    "having in mind the applications of the statistical description to particle production in heavy ion collisions we calculate @xmath16 in the ideal gas approximation , however , including all particles and resonances listed in @xcite .",
    "this is not an essential restriction , because , describing the freeze - out conditions , we are dealing with a dilute system where the interactions should not influence particle production anymore .",
    "we neglect any medium effects on particle properties . in general , however , already in the low - density limit , the modifications of resonance width or particle dispersion relation , in this particular for @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite , can not be excluded . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we use classical statistics , i.e.  we assume temperature and density regime so that all particles can be treated using boltzmann statistics .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions the absolute values of baryon number , electric charge and strangeness are fixed by the initial conditions . modeling particle production in statistical thermodynamics",
    "would , in general , require the canonical formulation of all these quantum numbers .",
    "> from the previous analysis @xcite , however , it is clear that only strangeness should be treated exactly , whereas the conservation of baryonic and electric charges can be described by the appropriate chemical potentials in the grand canonical ensemble .    within the approximations described above and neglecting the contributions from multi - strange baryons , the generating function in equation ( [ e : zq ] ) has the following form for a gas having zero total strangeness , @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined as",
    "the sum over all particles and resonances having strangeness @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the one - particle partition function defined as @xmath28 with the mass @xmath29 , spin - isospin degeneracy factor @xmath30 , the particle baryon number @xmath31 and electric charge @xmath32 .",
    "the volume of the system is @xmath33 and the chemical potentials related with the charge and the baryon number are determined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .    with the particular form of the generating function equations ( [ e : zs0],[e",
    ": n],[e : zk1 ] ) the @xmath36-integration in equation ( [ e : zq ] ) can be done analytically giving the canonical partition function for a gas with total strangeness @xmath37 in the following compact form @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the partition function of all particles having zero strangeness and the argument of the bessel function @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the calculation of the particle density @xmath42 in the canonical formulation is straightforward .",
    "it amounts to the replacement @xmath43 of the corresponding one - particle partition function in equation ( [ e :",
    "n ] ) and taking the derivative of the canonical ( c ) partition function equation ( [ e : zq ] ) with respect to the particle fugacity @xmath44    @xmath45    as an example , we quote the result for the density of thermal kaons in the canonical formulation assuming the total strangeness of the system @xmath22 , @xmath46 comparing the above formula with the result for thermal kaons density in the grand canonical ensemble , @xmath47 , one can see that the canonical result can be obtained from the grand canonical one replacing the strangeness fugacity @xmath48 in the following way : @xmath49 in the thermodynamic limit both the canonical and the grand canonical formulation are equivalent . for a small system , however , the differences are large .",
    "this can be seen in the most transparent way when comparing two limiting situations : the large and small volume limit of equation ( 2.10 ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath50 the argument of the bessel function @xmath51 , thus @xmath52 and the kaon density is independent of the volume of the system as expected in the grand canonical ensemble . on the other hand in the limit of a small volume",
    "we have    @xmath53    and the particle density is linearly dependent on the volume .",
    "it is thus clear that the major difference between the canonical and the grand canonical treatment of the conservation laws appears through different volume dependence of strange particle densities .",
    "the relevant parameter , @xmath54 , which measures the deviations of particle multiplicities from their grand canonical result is determined by the ratio of the bessel functions @xmath55 with the argument @xmath56 defined in equation ( [ e : x ] ) . in fig .  1 we show the canonical suppression factor @xmath54 as a function of the argument @xmath56 . to relate the initial volume of the system to the number of participants we use the approximate relation @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath56 at sis , ags and sps energies are calculated with the baryochemical potential and temperature extracted from the measured particle multiplicity ratios .",
    "the results in fig .  1",
    "show the importance of the canonical treatment of strangeness conservation at sis energies . here , the canonical suppression factor can be even larger than an order of magnitude .",
    "for central au - au collisions at ags or sps energies this suppression is not relevant any more and the ( gc)-formalism is adequate . in general , one expects that the statistical interpretation of particle production in heavy ion collisions requires the canonical treatment of strangeness conservation if the cms collation energy @xmath58 gev .",
    "this is mainly because at these energies the freeze - out temperature is still too low to maintain large - argument expansion of the bessel functions in equation ( [ e : i1i01 ] ) .    at low temperatures one needs to take into account the width of resonances",
    "this is because the number of pions coming from e.g.  the decay of a @xmath20-resonance is increased by the width of the @xmath20 .",
    "the approximation of the width by a delta function is therefore not justified since an appreciable number of particles come from the decay of resonances below the resonance mass .",
    "one therefore replaces the one - particle partition function in equations ( [ e : n ] ) and ( [ e : zk1 ] ) by : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is chosen to be the threshold value for resonance decay and @xmath61 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath62 is adjusted so that the integral over the breit - wigner factor gives one .    within the above model",
    ", the particle densities depend on four parameters : the chemical potentials , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , related with the ( gc)-description of charge and baryon number conservation , the temperature @xmath63 and the initial volume of the system appearing through the canonical treatment of strangeness conservation",
    ". constraints on these variables arise from the isospin asymmetry measured by the baryon number divided by twice the charge , @xmath64 .",
    "for an isospin symmetric system this ratio is simply 1 , for ni+ni it is 1.04 while for au+au this ratio is 1.25 .",
    "we are thus left with three independent parameters .",
    "for simplicity , the volume @xmath33 will be identified with the volume of the system created initially in @xmath2 collisions estimated from the atomic number of colliding nuclei and from the impact parameter by using geometric arguments .",
    "in particular we use the relation of the volume parameter and the number of participating nucleons as it was indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "in the following section we will discuss to what extent the thermal model can be used to understand particle production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sis energies .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in the first one we discuss the general trends found in thermal models . in particular",
    "we illustrate the sensitivity of particle ratios on the temperature , @xmath63 , and on the baryon chemical potential , @xmath35 .",
    "in the second part we discuss particle ratios measured in central collisions and compare experimental results obtained at sis with the expectations of the thermal model .",
    "this avoids the problem that different particle species might originate from different impact parameter regimes as it is the case with inclusive studies .",
    "the impact parameter dependence is studied in the third part of this section .",
    "> from equations ( [ e : nkc1],[e : i1i01],[e : i1i02 ] ) one sees that at fixed temperature and chemical potentials the volume dependence of kaon multiplicity in the canonical and the grand canonical ensemble is as following : @xmath65 this effect is shown explicitly in fig .  2 where the different particle ratios are calculated as a function of the radius of the system .",
    "in order to make the analysis more complete one needs , in addition , to take into account the contribution of resonance decays to particle production .",
    "we use all the known branching ratios as given in @xcite to calculate the particle multiplicities shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 involves one strange particle , and according to equation ( [ e : nkc1 ] ) should show substantial dependents on volume .",
    "indeed , it increases smoothly from zero up to the value given by the grand canonical ensemble . the increase is faster for higher temperature because the value of the argument @xmath56 of the bessel functions in equation ( [ e : nkc1 ] ) increases . in the @xmath5 ratio",
    "two strange particles are involved and the volume effect cancels out exactly . however , for very small values of the volume , there are a few non - strange resonances that decay into kaon pairs or into a kaon and a hyperon , this leads to the sharp rise in the value of this ratio for increasing volumes before it flattens off and becomes volume independent .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 involves only non - strange particles and therefore is independent of the size of the system .",
    "the same behavior is expected for @xmath68 mesons which is treated as non - strange particle , too .",
    "figure  3 evidences the locations of the freeze - out temperature @xmath69 and of the freeze - out @xmath70 yielding the various particle ratios .",
    "this figure shows also the sensitivity when varying their values within the limits occurring in the experimental results .",
    "discussing these trends requires different treatment of strange and non - strange particles .",
    "the interesting feature of the deuteron to proton ratio , @xmath71 , and the pion to proton ratio , @xmath72 , is that they allow a good determination of the range of the thermal parameters .",
    "the @xmath72 curve in the @xmath73 plane shows a temperature saturation for large @xmath35 which establishes the upper limit of the freeze - out temperature @xmath69 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath71 ratio fixes the range of the freeze - out @xmath70 as it shows a steep dependence on the temperature .",
    "in addition , as seen in fig .  3 , the variations of 20 - 30@xmath74 on the value of the @xmath71 ratio give a very similar range in the @xmath73 plane , making this observable particularly useful for the extraction of the freeze - out parameters .    in the sis - energy range one",
    "expects , in the thermal model , a different dependence of the strange and non - strange particle yields on the volume of the system .",
    "consequently , the ratio of strange to non - strange particle leads to a strong variation of thermal parameters with the system size . in fig .",
    "4 we show the @xmath66 ratio for different volumes . as expected , changing the volume implies a substantial modification of the curve in the @xmath73 plane corresponding to a fixed value of the @xmath66 yields .",
    "thus , calculating the strange to non - strange particle ratio requires additional care of the system size . in our approach , however , the volume is not treated as an additional parameter but is rather related with the number of participating nucleons in @xmath2 collisions . for a given system size",
    "the @xmath66 ratio clearly determines the lower limit of the freeze - out temperature .",
    "the curves in fig .  3 are calculated for @xmath75 = 4 fm .",
    "the @xmath5 in fig .",
    "3 yield exhibits similar behavior as @xmath71 , i.e. showing a very strong dependence on the temperature but a rather weak dependence on the baryon chemical potential , @xmath35 .",
    "this lines do not depend on the volume .",
    "an analysis of particle production in heavy ion collisions within a thermal fireball model requires two experimentally measured ratios to fix the freeze - out parameters , @xmath76 , and knowledge of the number of participating nucleons , @xmath77 to establish the size of the fireball .",
    "the knowledge of more particle ratios allows to test the concept of a unique freeze - out time . in the following section we compare the predictions of the thermal model with experimental results for central @xmath2 collisions at sis energies .",
    "in central collisions , the number of participating nucleons is maximal .",
    "however , experimental results for zero impact parameter , @xmath78 = 0 , are not directly measured .",
    "however , for many experiments good - quality impact - parameter results are available and an extrapolation to @xmath79 can be performed .",
    "the results of this extrapolation are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we discuss below the different entries in this table .",
    "the results in table 1 for pions are obtained from @xcite . for the ratio @xmath72 we used results from inclusive measurements since it was established that the pion multiplicity divided by the number of participants , @xmath80 , does not vary with @xmath77 @xcite . at ni - ni at 0.8 @xmath3gev @xmath81 data are not available and @xmath82 has been used to account for the isospin asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath0 results for ni+ni are from @xcite which are in very good agreement with @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 yield rises strongly with centrality as shown in @xcite . at 1.0 and 1.8 @xmath3gev",
    "the @xmath66 ratio was obtained by extrapolating to @xmath83 . at 0.8",
    "@xmath3gev we scaled with the inclusive @xmath66 ratio between 1.0 and 0.8 @xmath3gev .",
    "the impact - parameter dependence for @xmath84 and @xmath0 is nearly identical @xcite and we used therefore the @xmath5 ratio of the inclusive measurements .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath0 divided by the number of participants , @xmath85 , in au+au increases strongly with impact - parameter as shown in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81/@xmath86 ratios show  if at all  only a very slight increase with centrality @xcite and table 1 summarizes the results for inclusive studies .",
    "these values in @xcite agree very well with the isobar model .",
    "the ratios of @xmath71 obtained in ni+ni are from @xcite and those for au+au have been taken from @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath6 for ni+ni are from @xcite . at 1 @xmath3gev ni+ni",
    "has not been measured , yet ar+ca and kr+zr yield the equal ratios taking then also for ni+ni , at 0.8 @xmath3gev only ar+ca has been studied and this value is given in table 1 .",
    "the value at 1.8 @xmath3gev has been obtained by interpolation between 1.0 and 1.93 @xmath3gev .",
    "for au+au the results from @xcite have been corrected for the increase with centrality according to @xcite .",
    "figure  5 shows the lines in the @xmath73 plane corresponding to the measured particle ratios in au - au collisions at 1 @xmath3gev .",
    "the experimental errors are for simplicity not shown in the figure .",
    "all lines , except the one for @xmath87 , have a common crossing point around @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev .",
    "a value of @xmath90 fm is needed to describe the measured @xmath66 ratio with the freeze - out parameters extracted for @xmath72 , @xmath91 and @xmath71 .",
    "this radius corresponds to @xmath92 participating nucleons and is compatible with the one expected for central au - au collision .",
    "the strangeness suppression due to the canonical treatment of the conservation laws is very clear in the comparison of the thermal model with the au - au 1 @xmath3gev data .",
    "using the _ grand canonical _ formulation of the strangeness conservation one would get the value @xmath93 which overestimates the data by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this shows that the conditions for thermal particle phase space at sis energies are far from the grand canonical limit .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the corresponding results in the @xmath73 plane for ni - ni collisions at three different incident energies : 1.8 , 1.0 and 0.8 @xmath3gev . as for the au - au data we see in fig .  5 that all particle ratios , besides @xmath6 can be described by the same values of the freeze - out parameters .",
    "we notice the smaller radius of @xmath94 fm which is compatible with the smaller size of ni .",
    "the measured @xmath5 ratio leads to a band in the @xmath73 plane which barely misses the common crossing point for the mean values of @xmath72 , @xmath71 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , taking into account the experimental errors on the above particle ratios leads to a common , narrow @xmath73-band which contains also the line corresponding to the upper experimental limit for @xmath95 . allowing for a drop in the @xmath84 mass",
    "as proposed in model calculations @xcite leads to a shift of the @xmath5 band towards the left in fig .",
    "6 , thus leading to a better agreement with the other data .",
    "new experimental results on the @xmath5 ratio also for other collision systems are needed to clarify this open question .",
    "the values for the of @xmath71 ratio shown in fig .  6 for ni - ni collisions at 0.8 @xmath3gev were obtained by extrapolating the experimental measurements at e / a=1.06 , 1.45 , 1.93 summarized in table 1 using a linear and a polynomial fit giving the value @xmath71 = 0.4 , 0.43 . as one",
    "can see the 10@xmath74 deviation on @xmath71 ratio does not modify substantially the freeze - out line in the @xmath73 plane .",
    "the results of figs .  5 , 6 show that for central au - au and ni - ni collisions the particle ratios , @xmath72 , @xmath66 , @xmath91 , @xmath5 and @xmath71 , lead to a common crossing point in the @xmath73 plane .",
    "the appearance of the common freeze - out for all these particles is strong support for chemical equilibrium of these particles in the thermal model .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the results for the freeze - out temperature and chemical potential corresponding to different incident energies .",
    "it can be seen that the freeze - out temperature @xmath69 increases with e / a whereas @xmath70 shows the opposite trend . in the energy range considered this dependence can be approximated by a straight line .",
    "the freeze - out parameters are also seen in fig .  7 to be different in ni - ni and au - au collisions even for the same incident energy .",
    "it is interesting to remark that at a given incident energy the extracted values of @xmath69 are smaller for central au - au collisions than for central ni - ni ones .    using the freeze - out parameters relevant for sis energies we can compare the results with the previous findings for ags @xcite and sps @xcite energies .",
    "the chemical freeze - out points in the @xmath73 plane for relativistic heavy ion collisions are shown in fig .",
    "8 together with the predictions for @xmath96 and p - p collisions @xcite . connecting these points leads to a unique freeze - out curve in the @xmath73 plane @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the energy per hadron along the freeze - out curve ( before the final decay of the hadron ) is approximately 1 gev .",
    "it is a common feature of figs .  5 and 6 that the freeze - out line for @xmath68 production does not cross the common chemical freeze out extracted for all the other particle species .",
    "this deviation does not arise from the selection of central collisions . only for au - au collisions",
    "we have chosen the @xmath6 ratio of central collisions . in the ni - ni system  due to the lack of experimental results  inclusive values are given .",
    "for central ni - ni collisions the discrepancy would therefore increase .",
    "the results in @xcite show that the @xmath68 yield rises more than linearly with @xmath77 .",
    "this disagrees also with the expectations from the thermal concept discussed along with fig .  2 .",
    "the problem of @xmath68 abundance in the thermal model could have several origins .",
    "one possibility would be due to the sequential freeze - out for different particle species . here , @xmath68 could be produced earlier with higher temperature , roughly corresponding to the value obtained from the transverse momentum slope parameter of 80 mev . in this case , as seen in fig .",
    "6 , the large value of the @xmath87 ratio can be understood . in recent works",
    "@xcite experimental evidence is given that high - energy pions are emitted earlier than those with lower energies .",
    "this points towards a span in freeze - out times but does not affect the particle ratios which are dominated by low - energy pions . the concept of sequential freeze - out , however , might lead to a problem with the interpretation of all other particle ratios which are otherwise well described by the model .",
    "we stress that the same thermal model when applied to ags and sps energies explains particle productions there with a single set of freeze - out parameters for all particles including @xmath68 at sps energies .",
    "it seems rather difficult to argue the appearance of a sequential freeze - out at sis and its absence at ags and sps energies .",
    "the discrepancy of the thermal model on the level of @xmath68 production could possibly be related to the hidden strangeness content of the @xmath68 meson .",
    "the crucial difference in the thermal model interpretation of particle production at sps , ags and sis energies is due to the canonical strangeness suppression . in our formalism",
    "the @xmath68 is considered as a non - strange particle .",
    "it is conceivable that due to hidden strangeness there should be corrections to the @xmath68 yield from the canonical strangeness conservation .",
    "we do not know , yet , however , how these corrections could be included in a consistent way .",
    "the same arguments would apply also for the production of @xmath36 .",
    "yet , @xmath97 ( inclusive ) seems to fit into the common crossing shown for ni - ni at 1.8 @xmath3gev .",
    "the large @xmath68 yield could well be of dynamical origin which apriori can not be explained by the thermal freeze - out model applied in this work .",
    "thus , we leave the discrepancy of @xmath68 production as an unsolved puzzle in the thermal model .    concluding this part",
    ", we find that the thermal model gives a consistent description of both strange and non - strange particle production in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at sis energies with the exception of the @xmath87 ratio .",
    "there is a serious problem with the understanding of this ratio in terms of the thermal model .",
    "theory and experiment deviate by a factor of 2 to 8 , depending on the incident energy .",
    "the same problem has been indicated recently in the context of dynamical model for pion and @xmath68 production @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that recent transport - model calculations reproduce the measured @xmath68 and @xmath98 spectra @xcite .",
    "we would also like to draw attention to the systematics introduced by v. metag in which pions and @xmath68 s exhibit a common trend while @xmath0 , @xmath84 and @xmath36 show lower yields @xcite .    to check further the consistency of the model with the experimental data",
    "the impact parameter dependence of particle production and particle spectra are discussed in the next section .",
    "as already mentioned , the multiplicity of @xmath0 divided by the number of participants , @xmath99 , increases strongly with the centrality while the corresponding ratio for pions , @xmath99 , is constant @xcite .",
    "consequently , the pion yield is proportional to the number of nucleons in the initially created fireball while the multiplicity of @xmath0 scale with @xmath77 like @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "the experimental results on @xmath66 and @xmath99 ratios in au - au collisions from ref .",

    "the canonical treatment of strangeness conservation predicts the yield of strange particles to increase quadratically with the number of participants ( see eq .",

    "the rather small variation of the freeze - out temperature with impact parameter shown in fig .",
    "11 comes as a surprise since the experimental results on the apparent inverse slope parameter @xmath103 of particle yields shows a strong dependence on @xmath77 .",
    "the freeze - out temperature of @xmath104 mev derived from our analysis is also substantially lower than the value previously obtained from the particle spectra @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the differential cross sections for particle production . in fig .",
    "12 we show the variation of the inverse slope parameters observed for various particle species @xcite . yet , adopting our result , that there exists a common , impact - parameter independent , freeze - out temperature for all particles one needs to show that the variation in slope results from radial flow varying with impact parameter .",

    "the exponent for @xmath0 and for @xmath84 production is predicted to be equal while in the frame of the energy argument @xcite @xmath109 should be higher for @xmath84 than for @xmath0 due to different production thresholds ( neglecting in - medium mass modifications ) .",
    "it is clear that any non - isotropic emission pattern is beyond the scope of this model .",
    "however ,  as naively expected  the slopes of @xmath0 and of @xmath84 do not have to be equal as different resonance decays contribute .    the results of this section show that the thermal model gives a consistent picture for particle production in @xmath2 collisions at sis energies .",
    "in addition to the correct predictions for particle yields the model can also explain the @xmath77 dependence of @xmath0 cross section .",
    "assuming radial flow as an origin of the shape of particle spectra one can understand quantitatively the inverse slopes with a common temperature and radial flow velocity for all particles .",
    "the chemical and thermal freeze - out seem to be very close at sis energies .",
    "this is because the particle multiplicities and momentum spectra can be explained with the same temperature .",
    "in summary , the thermal model provides a remarkably consistent description of the experimental data in the gsi / sis energy range .",
    "the abundances of particles , @xmath111 and @xmath81 ( with the notable exception of @xmath68 s ) seem to come from a common hot source with a surprisingly well defined temperature , @xmath112 mev , and baryon chemical potential @xmath113 mev for central ni - ni at 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.8 @xmath3gev and correspondingly @xmath114 mev and @xmath115 mev for central au - au collisions at 1.0 @xmath3gev , as can be seen clearly from figs .  5,7 and 8 .",
    "these temperatures are lower than the ones observed in the particle spectra but here again a common explanation is possible in terms of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "flow differentiates between heavy and light particles since they acquire the same boost in velocity but of course very different kicks in momenta .",
    "this is clearly seen in the gsi / sis data shown in fig .",
    "12 which also summarize the transverse flow velocity for pions , kaons and protons .",
    "the common crossing points exhibited in figs .  5 , 6 are a very strong argument for chemical equilibrium .",
    "the deviations found for the production of @xmath68 mesons clearly ask for an explanation .",
