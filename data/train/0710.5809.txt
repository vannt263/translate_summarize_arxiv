    "hadronic matter undergoes deconfinement and chiral phase transitions to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase at finite temperature ( @xmath0 ) . owing to the asymptotic freedom of qcd ,",
    "the qgp phase at asymptotically high @xmath0 is composed of approximately free quarks and gluons , where a perturbation expansion is valid .",
    "it is known that the leading order of such an expansion is obtained with the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite which enables us to calculate the quark and gluon propagators in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "one of notable features obtained in the htl approximation is that the quarks and gluons have collective excitations with mass gaps called thermal masses proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "recently , properties of the qgp phase near the critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) acquire much interest .",
    "measurements of the elliptic flow of hadrons in the heavy - ion collisions were made at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , and the subsequent phenomenological analyses have shown that the experimental results are in remarkably good agreement with the predictions of the ideal fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the created matter is a strongly coupled system .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the properties of quarks in such a system , which constitute the basic degrees of freedom of the created matter in the deconfined phase together with gluons .",
    "we explore possible quasi - particle picture of quarks in the qgp phase near @xmath4 .",
    "it is not a priori clear whether quarks manifest themselves as well - defined quasi - particles in such a nonperturbative region ; quasi - particles in landau s sense correspond to peaks with a small width in the spectral function with relevant quantum numbers . in the phenomenological side ,",
    "the success of the recombination model to describe the rhic data @xcite tells us that the quark quasi - particles play an important role in some stage of the evolution of the created matter in rhic . in the theoretical side ,",
    "a recent lattice qcd simulation @xcite indicates the existence of the quasi - particles of quarks with small decay width , though in quenched approximation .",
    "quasi - particle properties of quarks are also obtained in a strong coupling gauge theory based on the schwinger - dyson equation at finite @xmath0 , unless the coupling is too large @xcite .",
    "the quarks thus will exist as one of the basic degrees of freedom of the system even near @xmath4 , and hence revealing their nature will provide us with important information necessary to understand the nature of qgp phase at the strong coupling .    to study the quasi - particle properties of quarks around @xmath4 , we notice the possible existence of hadronic excitations even in the qgp phase near @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in lattice qcd suggest the existence of such states in the heavy - quark sector @xcite . the existence of the mesonic excitations in the light - quark sector was also predicted as being the soft modes associated with the chiral transition @xcite .",
    "if such bosonic modes are light enough so that many particles are thermally excited in the system , they can in turn strongly affect excitation spectra of quarks .",
    "part of the authors in the present paper ( m.k .",
    ", t.k . and y.n .",
    ") considered such possibility in refs .",
    "they first evaluated the effect of the chiral soft modes on quarks in a chiral effective model @xcite where the soft modes are described as composite bosons composed of a quark and anti - quark : an interesting result obtained there was that there appears a novel three - peak structure in the quark spectral function near but above @xmath4 .",
    "it was also pointed out that the coupling of quarks with bosonic excitations which have a finite mass and small width is essential for the formation of the multi - peak structure .",
    "in fact , it was later shown @xcite that the three - peak structure in the quark spectral function emerges at intermediate temperatures even in the yukawa models composed of a massless fermion and a massive boson with a zero width , irrespective whether the boson is of scalar , pseudoscalar , vector or axial - vector type .    in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "the massless quarks were exclusively adopted to explore the effects of the soft modes on the quarks in the most ideal case where the chiral symmetry is exact . in reality , the quarks in the qgp phase near @xmath4 should have current or dynamical dirac masses which may be as large as the order of @xmath4 and may not be negligible .",
    "in this paper , we examine how the finite dirac mass of the quark modifies the spectral properties , employing the yukawa model composed of a massive quark with a small mass and a massive boson .",
    "we shall show that the three - peak structure found in ref .",
    "@xcite survives even with finite @xmath1 , although one of the three peaks is gradually suppressed as @xmath1 is larger .",
    "in addition to the analysis of the spectral function , we newly explore the pole structure of the quark propagator in the complex - energy plane and their residues .",
    "we show that there always exist three poles corresponding to the peaks in the spectral function in the complex - energy plane at finite @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that the trajectories of these poles along with an increase of @xmath0 undergoes a structural change at a critical value of @xmath1 as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we give a physical interpretation for these properties of the quark spectrum at finite @xmath1 adapting the notion of the level repulsion in quantum mechanics .",

    "we note , however , that the effect of the hadronic excitations is not incorporated in the quenched approximation . the full lattice simulation would properly describe the effect of such excitations on the quark spectrum .",

    "to examine these observables with the quark propagator obtained in the present study is beyond the scope of this work and left as a future project .",

    ", we show that this has a generic nature using a simple but generic model . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case for vanishing momentum as in the main text .",
    "first , let us consider the quark spectrum for the massless quark . to investigate effects of the peak structure in the imaginary part of the self - energy on the quark spectrum , we assume that the imaginary part of the retarded quark self - energy consists of two peaks expressed with lorentzian forms , @xmath143 ,    \\label{im2}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 denote the peak positions and @xmath145 denote the widths . an overall factor @xmath146 having mass dimension two",

    "@xcite , the formation of the peaks in im@xmath141 is caused by the landau damping which is scattering processes with a boson .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the peaks become higher rapidly as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : se00 ] and [ fig : se01 ] , which corresponds to @xmath149 being smaller .    the corresponding real part of the self - energy is uniquely determined from the imaginary part :",
    "because the landau damping is a medium effect , the real part is ultraviolet finite and given by the un - subtracted dispersion relation , @xmath150.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spectral function is then obtained from the self - energy , @xmath151 $ ] .    as an example , we plot the spectral function and the self - energy for @xmath142 in fig .  [",
    "fig : lor02 ] . for simplicty ,",
    "we have set @xmath152 . from the number of crossing points between re@xmath141 and the line @xmath153 ,",
    "one finds that this self - energy is close to that for @xmath154 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : se00 ] .",
    "we see that the resultant quark specral function @xmath91 has a clear three - peak structure . for smaller values of @xmath149 , i.e. higher @xmath0 ,",
    "the three peaks are sharper and higher than those in fig .",
    "[ fig : lor02 ] .    for very high @xmath0 , however , the strength of the central peak in @xmath91 gets weaker and",
    "eventually @xmath91 becomes to have only two peaks which correspond to the normal quasi - quark and the anti - plasimino as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spc ] . in the yukawa models ,",
    "this can be understood from the fact that as @xmath0 increases , in addition to two peaks in im@xmath141 being higher , the positions of the two peaks approaches the origin . in terms of eq .",
    "( [ im2 ] ) , this means @xmath155 for @xmath156 , thus it becomes hard to distinguish the two peaks , and thus im@xmath141 only shows a one - peak structure as a whole .",
    "one can show in a generic way that the one - peak structure of im@xmath141 leads to a two - peak structure of the quark spectral function .",
    "in fact , this rule can be extended to the cases where im@xmath141 has multiple peaks ; the number of the peaks in im@xmath141 is significantly reflected in the number of the peaks in @xmath91 .",
    "next we consider the quark spectrum for the massive quark . in this case ,",
    "@xmath158 and @xmath159 are in general not identical to @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively . however , from fig .",
    "[ fig : se01 ] , we see that such asymmetry is not so large for small values of the quark mass @xmath1 .",
    "then , for simplicty , we employ the same self - energy as that for the massless quark .",
    "the mass effect only enters the expression of the spectral function , @xmath162 $ ] .    as an example , we plot the spectral function and the self - energy for @xmath142 and @xmath157 in fig .  [",
    "fig : lor02 m ] . from the number of crossing points between re@xmath141 and the line @xmath163 , this self - energy is colse to that for @xmath154 in fig .",
    "[ fig : se01 ] .",
    "we see that the rightmost peak is enhanced , which results from the shift of the crossing points .",
    "this result of the quark spectrum is also consistent with that in fig .",
    "[ fig : spc ] .",
    "in short , we have shown that a simple but plausible assumption on the peak structure in the imaginary part of the self - energy generically leads to the multi - peak structure in the quark spectral function obtained in dynamical models such as the yukawa models .",
