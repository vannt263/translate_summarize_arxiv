    "the stephan s quintet ( hereafter sq ) compact galaxy group is unusual among nearby compact groups because it contains a prominent ( @xmath835kpc length ) intergalactic filament , first discovered in the radio continuum , but later found to emit optical emission lines and soft x - rays consistent with a large - scale shock @xcite .",
    "the best explanation for the formation of this giant structure is that it represents a region of highly excited shocked gas caused by the collision of a high - speed `` intruder '' galaxy , ngc 7318b , with a pre - existing tidal filament generated in the past within the group .",
    "numerical models of the past history of sq support this picture @xcite .",
    "the discovery of powerful , l(h@xmath1 ) @xmath3 10@xmath9 ergs s@xmath4 , broad ( @xmath8800 km s@xmath4 wide ) pure - rotational mid - ir emission lines from warm molecular hydrogen and [ siii]@xmath1034.8@xmath0 m ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig.1a ) provided the first glimpse of the tremendous dissipation of energy in the shock ",
    "the h@xmath1 lines significantly out - shining the soft x - ray luminosity , and optical line emission .",
    "the cooling time of the h@xmath1 lines is so short that in - situ heating is required to explain the emission .",
    "@xcite provided an explanation for the similar distribution of warm h@xmath1 and x - ray continuum in terms of the dissipation of energy caused by the collision of the intruder with multi - phase intergroup gas . in this model ,",
    "x - rays are created in low - density regions which are shock - heated to high temperatures , whereas the h@xmath1 emission arises in denser pockets of gas that survive the passage of the main shock .",
    "additional evidence @xcite for a multi - phase shocked medium has come from the discovery of broad - line co ( 1 - 0 , 2 - 1 and 3 - 2 ) emission from the filament .",
    "molecular gas is seen at velocities ranging from that of the `` intruder '' galaxy ngc7318b v@xmath11 = 5774 km s@xmath4 ) to that of the intergroup gas ( v@xmath11 = 6600 - 6700 km / s ) .",
    "the motions inferred from the co kinematics support the idea that a significant amount of kinetic energy is still present in the filament .",
    "dissipation of this energy can easily provide a plausible source of in - situ heating of the warm h@xmath1 emission .",
    "given the potential importance of turbulence and shocks in dissipating mechanical energy throughout the universe , a goal of the current project is to quantify line cooling in an environment which is free of the potentially confusing effects of star formation .",
    "if the picture of a turbulent cascade of energy down from the galaxy - collision - scales to the scale of small molecular - clouds is correct , energy may leak out at different scales and densities .",
    "our observations are aimed at quantifying the importance of shocks and turbulence in the main far - ir ism cooling lines of [ cii ] and [ oi ] .",
    "the sq filament is an obvious target because we already have seen that molecular line emission is a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity in the structure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , suzuki et al . (",
    "2011 ) suggested that [ cii ] emission might be contributing to a broad - band 160@xmath0 m image obtained with akari .",
    "indeed the approximate surface brightness levels inferred from their measurements for [ cii ] contamination are not far from the values we detect spectroscopically in this paper .    in order to address some of these questions",
    ", we obtained _ herschel _ observations covering the wavelength range of important ism far - ir emission lines with pacs , as well as spire observations which allow for the potential detection of the higher - j transitions of co ( not possible from the ground ) which would probe denser and potentially warmer molecular clouds .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance to the main background group ( excluding the assumed foreground galaxy ngc 7320 ) of 94 mpc @xcite . at this distance , 10 arcsecs corresponds to a linear scale of 4.5 kpc .",
    "observations were made using the pacs integral field spectrometer @xcite and the spire fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ; @xcite ) onboard the herschel space observatory ( pilbratt et al .",
    "2010 ) on 2011 dec 7 - 8 and 2012 may 17 respectively , as part of an open time program ( pi appletonpappleto@xmath121 ] ) .",
    "in addition , _ herschel _ photometric observations from a companion paper ( guillard et al . 2013 ) will be used to provide far - ir continuum measurements in the current paper .    for the pacs spectrometer ,",
    "observations of the [ cii]157.74@xmath0 m and [ oi]63.18@xmath0 m lines were made in the first and third - order gratings using a short `` range - scan '' mode covering the redshifted wavelength range 160.4 - 161.74 and 64.3 - 64.72 @xmath0 m , with a velocity resolution of @xmath8235 and @xmath885 km s@xmath4 respectively .",
    "the first - order and third order spectra are detected on independent red and blue spectrometer arrays .",
    "the grating was stepped in high sampling mode providing a heliocentric velocity coverage at the [ cii ] line of 4200 - 8500 km s@xmath4 and 5000 - 7700 km s@xmath4 for [ oi ] designed to detect broad emission from the group .",
    "the pacs integral field unit ( ifu ) uses an image - slicer and reflective optics to project 5 x 5 spatial pixels ( each 9.4  x 9.4  on the sky ) through the spectrometer system over a total field of view of 47  x 47  .",
    "three separate `` pointed mode '' chop / nod observations were made ( 3 arcminute chopper throw ) with 4 hrs of integration time per pointing to cover the main parts of the sq filament ( see fig.1a , b ) .",
    "two of the pointings cover the main north - south structure of the molecular filament , and a third covers a connecting h@xmath1 `` bridge '' between the main shocked filament and the galaxy ngc 7319 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "pacs data reduction was performed using the standard herschel software herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) user build 8.3 , and the results were later checked with hipe 9.0 and 11.1 which have superior flat - fielding capabilities ( no significant differences were seen ) .",
    "data processing , included flagging and ignoring bad pixels and saturated data , subtraction of chop `` on '' and `` off '' data , division of the relative spectral response function , and the application of a flat - field .",
    "the data were converted from standard data frames to rebinned data cubes by binning these data in the wavelength domain using default parameters ( oversample = 2 , upsample = 4 ) which samples the spectra at the nyquist rate in the two bands .",
    "finally data for the two nods were averaged , resulting in a single rebinned data cube for each of the three separate pointing positions ( fig.1b ) .    as a check that the results were not affected by possible uncertainty in the relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) , and to check that the line fluxes and baselines were the same using both methods ( especially in the blue )",
    ", we also ran these data through a separate pipeline which normalizes the detector signals to an average telescope background spectrum ( e. g. see @xcite for brief description of method)-the so - called flux normalization method .",
    "the results were essentially identical both in baseline shape and flux density to less than a few @xmath13 . for both methods ,",
    "the primary flux calibration is based on neptune .",
    "both methods should yield absolute rms flux calibration uncertainties of 11@xmath13 in both bands .    because the pacs data were not taken in a fully sampled manner , but rather as three separate pointed observations",
    ", we can not justify extractions of spectra from a combined map .",
    "rather we choose , more correctly , to extract individual spaxels from the cubes . in order to obtain regions significantly larger than the fhwm of the psf at both wavelengths ( 9.3 arcsecs at 160@xmath0 m and 3.7 arcsec at 64@xmath0 m )",
    ", we generously extracted 2 x 2 spaxel regions ( effectively areas 18.8 x 18.8 arcsec@xmath2 ) .",
    "these five large regions , labled a through e , were selected for spectral extraction .",
    "since the emission is observed to be quite smoothly distributed on the scale of a few pacs spaxels , the extracted spectra should provide a realistic measurement of the emission in the two lines .",
    "the regions were selected to provide representative samples of the main x - ray and h@xmath1-defined shocked filament which runs nearly north / south over a physical scale of 35 kpc : region a through d. region e , was extracted in the direction of the feature which we call the `` h@xmath1 bridge '' ( see cluver et al .",
    "2010 ) , which previous observations @xcite have shown to contain broad co lines indicating strong turbulence . in order to ensure we could extract _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra from the same regions as pacs , we could not extend our extraction boxes too far to the north or south of the pacs ifu areas without loosing coverage with the irs short - low module .",
    "the short - low module provides crucial information about the strength of pah features , and proves to be important later in the paper .",
    "region e was chosen specifically to minimize the amount of possible star formation activity in the bridge by inspection of both the 24@xmath0 m and 11.3 @xmath0 m pah maps of cluver et al . as a result , region e has some overlap with region b ) .",
    "the regions ( a - e ) were extracted from the final rebinned cubes ( slicedfinalcube product ) of the level 2 data using the cube analysis task in the spectrum explorer package in hipe 9.1 .",
    "spire fts observations were made in the sparse - mapping single - pointing mode with 100 repetitions .",
    "this resulted in 3.7 hrs on - source integration time .",
    "the spire fts has two detector arrays , ssw and slw , covering overlapping bands ( 194 - 313 @xmath0 m and 303 - 671 @xmath0 m respectively ) , and was used in the high - resolution mode .",
    "this provided a spectral resolution 370 @xmath14 r @xmath14 1300 from the short to longest wavelengths .",
    "the fts data were processed using hipe 9.0 user reprocessing script with calibration product spire_cal_9_0 .",
    "we retained all the inner detectors up to the ssw / slw co - aligned detector ring .",
    "the data were processed to the final level where a point - source spectrum was derived per detector .",
    "fig.1c shows the footprints of the fwhm of individual detector - horn footprints superimposed on the r - band image of sq .",
    "the spitzer infrared spectrometer ( irs ) observations were made in spectral - mapping mode and cover a large portion of the sq filament .",
    "full details of these observations have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "irs data cubes constructed and presented by cluver et al . were used for comparison with the pacs ifu data as follows .",
    "the spitzer sl and ll data cubes , which had been constructed at native spatial and spectral resolution using cubism @xcite , were degraded at each wavelength within the cube to an effective spatial resolution of 9.4 arcsecs designed to match the resolution of the herschel - observed [ cii ] line with pacs ( @xmath10 observed = 160@xmath0 m ) using a flux - conserving wavelength - dependant convolution .",
    "spectra extracted from these convolved cubes formed the basis for the comparison between the spitzer and herschel data discussed below .",
    "for the five selected pacs regions we also extracted photon count and energy information from the deep ( 95 ks ) _ chandra _ x - ray map of osullivan et al .",
    "the observations utilized the s3 ccd detector of _ chandra _ and the analysis followed the same procedure as described in the above paper , except that the ciao package ( version 4.5 with caldb 4.5.5.1 ) was used to extract the pacs target regions . for each region an absorbed astrophysics plasma emission code ( apec )",
    "model @xcite was fitted to the regions , providing best ",
    "fit values for gas temperature , metallicity and x - ray luminosity .",
    "apec calculates line and continuum emissivities for hot , optically thin plasma assumed to be in collisional ionized equilibrium , and draws on a library of over a million individual emission lines to build synthetic spectra which are used in the fit .",
    "the pacs data cubes associated with the three partially overlapping pointings revealed extended [ cii ] emission over most of the region defined by the h@xmath1 filament ( e. g. the blue emission in fig.1a ) .",
    "fig.2a - e show the extracted spectra from region a - e ( see fig.1b ) for the [ cii]158@xmath0 m ( solid black ) and [ oi]63@xmath0 m ( solid red ) displayed on the same radial velocity scale . to allow a better comparison ,",
    "the [ oi]63@xmath0 m spectra were smoothed to the same velocity resolution as the [ cii ] spectra ( 235 km s@xmath4 ) .",
    "the extracted spectra show several unusual features .",
    "the [ cii ] emission is strong , broad and asymmetric , with typical total line widths exceeding 1000 km / s .",
    "this is consistent with broad warm h@xmath1 emission @xcite observed with _ spitzer _ with considerably poorer spectral resolution .",
    "fainter emission from [ oi]63@xmath0 m is also detected in regions a , b and c , covering the same velocity range as the [ cii ] . in d and e ,",
    "the [ oi ] seems to be only associated with the lower - velocity component of the [ cii ] line .",
    "we note that the double - peaked profile evident in both the [ cii ] , co and [ oi ] profiles for region a is very similar to that seen by @xcite with the vla in hi emission .",
    "hi was not detected in the rest of the main north - south h@xmath1 filament of fig.1 , i.e. sampled by regions b , c and d , nor in region e.    the spectra also resemble the single - dish observations of the co ( 1 - 0 ) transition of the cold molecular gas obtained with the iram 30 m telescope by @xcite . except for region",
    "b , where the iram beam is offset from the pacs extraction center by about 14 arcsecs ( more than half the fwhm of the iram beam at 112.8 ghz - the observing frequency of the co line ) , the other pointings differ by no more than 4 arcsecs .",
    "these spectra are shown superimposed on the pacs spectra in fig.2 , and have been smoothed to an effective spectral resolution of 235 km s@xmath4 to match the [ cii ] resolution . although the [ cii ] data do not perfectly match the size and shape of the circular iram beam ( fwhm 22  ) , the extracted square pacs spaxels in regions a , b and c show similar spectral components to the co. in regions b and c , a bright low - velocity component and a fainter high - velocity component are evident , whereas for a , the situation is reversed .",
    "the [ cii ] emission seems to fill - in the velocity space between the two main components of the co emission .",
    "the nearest iram spectrum to region e is only offset by 2.6 arcsecs in declination from the pacs spectrum and yet shows some differences from the pacs extraction .",
    "recent co observations made with pdb interferometer ( guillard et al . in preparation ) , show significant velocity gradients across that region in the molecular gas , and so the offset in the iram pointing may be responsible for the different line shape between the [ cii ] and the co. however , it is clear that both the co and the [ cii ] lines are broad there emission , but this may be partly baseline uncertainty in the iram data . ] .",
    "the overall similarity between the [ cii ] line profiles , and the co line profiles in the main part of the filament suggests a kinematic connection between the [ cii ] emission ( and in some cases the [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission ) , and the molecular gas .",
    "in addition to being broad , the [ cii ] emission is stronger than the [ oi ] emission ( see table 1 where the extracted line fluxes are presented ) .",
    "we will argue later that this is consistent with a warm diffuse gas heated by a network of low - velocity magnetic shocks ( c - shocks ) , and/or turbulence .",
    "the weakness of the [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission is not consistent with strongly dissipative j - shocks @xcite .",
    "single and multiple gaussian line fitting of the extracted [ cii ] ( and [ oi ] where appropriate ) was performed using the isap package developed for iso @xcite .",
    "line fluxes for the decomposed gaussian fits are given in table 2 .",
    "regions b , c and d required 3 different velocity components spanning the range from 6000 - 7000 km / s to provide a good fit to these data  in most cases very large line widths were required .",
    "region c and e have the broadest fitted single components with fwhm of 630 and 750 km s@xmath4 respectively , although the composite spectra span over 1000 km s@xmath4 in total dispersion .      at each detector position",
    ", we fit simultaneously a polynomial continuum and all the targeted lines with individual sinc profiles in frequency . for each sinc profile",
    ", we initially fixed the fwhm at the value for an unresolved line ( 1.44 ghz ) .",
    "the targeted lines are the co rotational transitions , known water lines , [ nii ] 205 microns , [ ci ] 370 & 609 microns .",
    "the only clearly detected line is the water line p - h@xmath1o ( 1@xmath50@xmath6 ) at @xmath15@xmath16 1113.3ghz (= 269.28@xmath0 m ) , which is detected s / n @xmath35 in four ssw detectors : sswd4 , sswe3 , sswe4 and sswc4 .",
    "the ssw spectrum for detector d4 is shown in fig.3 , where the zoomed - in region shows the p - h@xmath1o ( 1@xmath50@xmath6 ) line , detected at a s / n of @xmath810 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we refitted this line allowing the fwhm to vary , but the line was still found to be unresolved at 324 km s@xmath4 ( 1.44 ghz ) resolution .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission which appears much broader .",
    "the spire fitted heliocentric velocities and fwhm for the detected positions are provided in table 2 .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of the h@xmath1o line for ssw d4 is 6457@xmath17120 km  s@xmath4 , which places it close to the line - center of the broad , but asymmetric [ cii ] emission from the same position ( pacs region c of fig.2c ) .",
    "table 2 also provides the central velocity and fwhm for the other detections in ssw e3 , e4 and c4 .",
    "note that there appears to be a significant radial velocity difference between the center of the sq shock near ssw d4 and the ssw c4 ( shock south ) and ssw e3 ( shock - north ) detector positions .",
    "this follows the general trend of lower heliocentric velocities in the southern part of the shocked filament ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , no other h@xmath1o lines are detected ( table 3 provides upper limits ) .",
    "on the para - h@xmath1o ladder , the next highest ground - state transition is the p - h@xmath1o ( 2@xmath18 1@xmath5 ) line at 987 ghz , and on the otho - ladder , the o - h@xmath1o ( 1@xmath19 1@xmath20 ) at 557 ghz .",
    "neither of these or other higher - order lines are detected at 3-sigma levels of @xmath14 0.48 - 0.2 x 10@xmath21 w m@xmath22 , 3 to 5 times lower than the detection of the ph@xmath1o ( 1@xmath5 0@xmath6 ) line .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath10205@xmath0 m line ( @xmath15@xmath16 = 1461.13ghz ) , a line often associated with hii regions , is not detected , nor are any of the higher - j co lines , commonly found in spire spectra of higher - excitation galaxies detected convincingly .",
    "upper limits for these and other commonly encountered ism lines are also given for these lines in table 3 .",
    "_ spitzer _ irs observations obtained as part of a large spectral mapping program ( cluver et al .",
    "2010 ) contain important spatial information about molecular hydrogen cooling and pah emission across the sq filament .",
    "for comparison with the pacs regions , we performed matching extractions of the irs data cubes covering the same areas as the pacs regions a through e. the spectra , shown in fig.4 , are strongly dominated by molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "fig.4 also shows the model result of running pahfit @xcite on the spectra .",
    "the red lines show the fits to atomic and molecular lines ( mainly h@xmath1 ) , and the green line under each spectrum shows the fitted pah features .",
    "the results of the fit , converted into line fluxes are presented in table 1 .",
    "it is clear from the spectra that the h@xmath1 lines , 0 - 0s(0 ) to s(5 ) dominate the spectrum of the sq filament , with faint emission from [ neii]12.8@xmath0 m .",
    "stronger emission from the [ siii]34.8@xmath0 m line is likely shock - excited ( cluver et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the irs spectra in fig.4 show that in the filament , the 6.3 and 7.7@xmath0 m pah bands , usually associated with star formation are very weak , especially in pacs regions b , c and e. faint 11.3@xmath0 m pah is detected at most positions , although the total power in all the pah lines is small . in table 1",
    "we tabulate the power in the 7 - 8@xmath0 m pah features ( defined as the sum of the 7.4 , 7.6 , 7.8 , 8.3 , and 8.6 @xmath0 m bands if present ) , as well as the integral over the main pah bands ( pah@xmath7 defined here as the sum of all the common pah features from 6.3 - 17 @xmath0 m ) .",

    "this property , and the absence of a strong enough soft x - ray flux led to the conclusion that the warm h@xmath1 detected by spitzer must be shock excited ( see also * ? ? ?",

    ", we followed a two - step process .",
    "first we convolved the 24 , 100 , 160 , 250 and 350@xmath0 m maps to a spatial resolution appropriate for the 500@xmath0 m spire image ( @xmath829 arcsecs fhwm ) .",
    "we then extracted an sed at these five wavelengths from each of the regions a - e shown in fig.1b .",
    "this allowed us to fit the 24 - 500@xmath0 m sed with a modified black - body and a mid - infrared power - law ( see casey et al .",
    "2012 for a description of the method ) .",
    "we computed the gas masses from the dust masses , assuming a dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.006 ( xu et al .",
    "we call this the `` smoothed '' sed model .",
    "secondly , in order to estimate the far - ir ( fir ) fluxes @xcite in each region , on an angular scale comparable with the [ cii ] data , we re - extracted the 160 @xmath0 m fluxes at the full resolution of the 160@xmath0 m map .",
    "we then normalized the smoothed sed model to the value at 160@xmath0 m from the full - resolution map to derive fir flux per aperture over the range 42 - 122@xmath0 m .",
    "fig.5 shows the sed obtained from the smoothed data , as well as the sed after tying it to the full resolution 160@xmath0 m data , for two examples region a and e. the effect of scaling the sed results in only a minor change when the dust emission is extended ( as in the case of region e ) .",
    "the low flux value for the 24@xmath0 m point in region e when scaled to the resolution of the 160@xmath0 m observation ( red point ) is evidence for a dearth of small grains ( see later ) .",
    "the fir properties measured in each of the five pacs apertures calculated by this method is given in table 4 .",
    "based on the fir fluxes and [ cii ] line strength ( summed over all the velocity components detected within each pacs aperture ) we calculate the [ cii]/fir ratio , and this is given table 1 .",
    "it can be seen that these ratios are unusually large , ranging from @xmath80.04 ( region a & d ) to 0.06 - 0.08 ( regions b , c and e ) . in general ,",
    "[ cii]/fir ratios of less than 1@xmath13 are common in normal galaxies ( see fig .",
    "interestingly , the regions that have the highest [ cii]/fir ratios are also the same regions that show the most extreme [ cii]/pah ratios .",
    "those regions with known star formation ( region a and d ) have lower ratios , indicating that the star formation influences the results by lowering both ratios .",
    "we also measure approximately the intensity ratio of the [ cii ] to co ( j=1 - 0 ) transition based on the spectra of figure 2 , given that the extraction regions for the [ cii ] are square and not always precisely aligned with the iram 30-m beam .",
    "the co spectra were converted to jansky units from antenna temperature assuming a value of 6.2 jy / k , a value appropriate for compact emission smaller than the 22 arcsec beam .",
    "we also scaled the [ cii ] extracted fluxes by a factor of 1.54 to account for the difference in the areas of the [ cii ] and co extractions .",
    "if the emission is clumpy on the arcsecs scale , this scaling may not be appropriate , and the [ cii]/co ratio would be lower .",
    "the results range from 1000 @xmath14 i([cii])/i(co j= 1 - 0 ) @xmath14 1700 in regions b through e , and 2400 in region a ( which includes emission from the sq - a star forming region ) .",
    "these values are on the low - end of the distribution of values found in the milky - way and other nearby galaxies ( e. g. stacey et al .",
    "1991 ; 2010 ) .",
    "one might be tempted to conclude that the low values of i([cii])/i(co ) ratio point towards a low - excitation pdr model , but this is not the case because the same regions also have very elevated [ cii]/fir ratios placing them outside of any standard pdr model ( see stacey et al .",
    "2010 ; fig .",
    "low metallicity is also unlikely to be the explanation .",
    "the _ average _ metallicity of the gas ( summed over all the velocity components ) is either mildly sub - solar or approximately solar ( see section 5.3 for a more complete discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , our observations of the i([cii])/i(co ) ratio deviate significantly ( to _ lower _ values ) from those measured in the lmc / smc .",
    "we will show later that shock models are capable of reproducing the observed ratios .",
    "to constrain the gas temperature and density , we computed the theoretical c@xmath25 and oxygen cooling rates with a simple numerical model to compare with our observations .",
    "this code computes the gas chemistry and thermal balance at a constant temperature and density , assuming the carbon is all in the form of c@xmath25 .",
    "it makes no _ a priori _ assumptions about the source of heating which we will consider in the next section .",
    "we considered 42 chemical species , and use a chemical network of 285 reactions ( a simplified version of the one used in the shock model of @xcite and assume solar metallicity .",
    "for the [ cii ] and total oxygen cooling rates we consider the collisional effect of primarily h and h@xmath1 . we also include cosmic - ray heating , and parameterize its influence via the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",

    "the figure shows that at n@xmath26 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath28 , the [ cii ] cooling rate does not depend strongly on the cosmic - ray ionization rate , because the gas rapidly recombines at higher densities . above t@xmath8500k , the [ cii ] cooling drops at high densities where oxygen cooling dominates .",

    "fig.7 shows the model ratio of the c@xmath25 to total oxygen cooling ( both the [ oi]63 and 145@xmath0 m lines ) as a similar function of density and temperature .",
    "although the model does not distinguish between the two oxygen lines , [ oi]63@xmath0 m emission is the dominant coolant over the range of densities and temperatures considered here .        how do these models compare with the observations of the [ cii ] lines ?",
    "the [ cii ] cooling rates for the 5 regions observed with pacs are computed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the hydrogen mass and @xmath31 is the mass of cii - emitting gas .",
    "let us first assume that the total gas mass can be derived from the far - ir observations ( guillard et al .",
    "2013 ) based on an assumed dust - to - gas ratio of 0.006 ( e. g. from xu et al .",
    "these values are provided in table 4 for each pacs region , and lie in the narrow range 9.5 @xmath32 10@xmath33 @xmath14 m@xmath34/m@xmath35 @xmath14 1.7 @xmath32 10@xmath36 , and a dust temperature of 22 - 24 k. if we assume that all of this gas mass is involved in the observed [ cii ] cooling , then the cooling rates , based on each pacs region will range from 5 - 9 @xmath32 10@xmath37 w h - atom@xmath4 : the horizontal lines in fig.6 .",
    "the comparison of the modeled and observed cooling rates shows that with this relatively high gas mass , the models and observation constrain the gas to be relatively warm ( 50 @xmath14 t @xmath38500 k ) , and of moderate density ( 500 @xmath14 n@xmath26 @xmath14 3 - 7 @xmath32 10@xmath27 ) .",
    "the temperature can be further constrained if we also include the observed [ oi]63@xmath0 m line cooling , and the ratio of the [ cii]/[oi]63@xmath0 m obtained from table 1 ( ranging between values of 2 and 9 ) are shown on fig.7 .",
    "this indicates that the temperature of the gas lies in a approximate range 90 @xmath14 t @xmath14 200 k. combining the two diagnostics of fig.6 and 7 , we can conclude that if all the gas inferred from the dust sed takes part in the atomic line cooling , then the gas density lies in a narrow range of densities around 10@xmath27 @xmath28 and a temperature of between 90 and 200 k.    it may be no coincidence that this temperature is similar to the dominant temperature found by analysis of the warm h@xmath1 gas observed by spitzer ( see cluver et al .",
    "for example , one could imagine that the warm h@xmath1 mass detected from _",
    "spitzer _ might be the dominant collisional heating source for the [ cii ] emission . to consider this possibility , we derive the associated warm molecular hydrogen mass for each of the pacs extraction regions based on a simple two - temperature fit to the excitation diagrams of each region derived from the _ spitzer _ spectral extractions .",
    "these warm h@xmath1 masses are presented in table 5 .",
    "these masses are only a factor of two smaller than the gas masses estimated from the dust sed , ranging from 4 - 7 @xmath32 10@xmath33 m@xmath35 for pacs regions b , c and e ) .    under the assumption that the c@xmath25 gas is primarily collisionally heated by the warm h@xmath1 , the cooling rate per h - atom ( horizontal lines in fig.6 ) would double , leading to solutions with densities 1.5 @xmath32 10@xmath27 @xmath14 @xmath39 @xmath14 4 @xmath32 10@xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the general conclusion of the study of the cooling rates of the far - ir lines is that the gas in the filament is both warm and diffuse .",
    "it is thus very plausible that the warm h@xmath1 and the [ cii ] and [ oi ] emitting gas are well mixed in approximate thermal balance .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the [ cii ] emission is consistent with heating by a warm diffuse gas .",
    "what would be the source of heat for this gas ?",
    "could the [ cii ] emission we observe be the result of collisional excitation of the ground - state c+ ions by hot electrons in the plasma associated with a faint population of hii - region population scattered throughout the filament ?",
    "although there is evidence for a sparsely scattered population of hii regions in the shock based on optical and mid - ir measurements @xcite , we can directly rule this out from our own observations .",
    "firstly , our spire observations , which cover similar regions to those observed by pacs show no detection of the [ nii]205@xmath0 m nebula line down to a 3-sigma uncertainty of 2.7 x 10@xmath40 w m@xmath22 for detector ssw d4 ( centered close to region c ) and 2.0 x 10@xmath40 w m@xmath22 for the average flux over the 4 inner detectors which were seen to show h@xmath1o emission .",

    "this is not a surprise , since it has been known for some time that the sq filament contains only a scattering of compact hii regions along its length ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these hii regions occupy a small volume of the filament . furthermore , the mass of gas required to explain the strength of the [ cii ] line is far too large to be associated with the observed compact hii regions .",
    "guillard et al .",
    "( 2009 ) estimated the mass of ionized gas to be 1.2 @xmath32 10@xmath41 m@xmath42 over an aperture of 5.2 x 2.1 kpc@xmath2 , based on the emission measure of the h@xmath43 line obtained across the filament by xu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and assuming reasonable conditions in the diffuse medium for the post - shocked gas .",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude below the total warm molecular mass in the same aperture .",
    "given that the sq filament is known to emit soft x - rays , it is reasonable to ask whether x - rays could heat the gas in the filament .",
    "we have shown in previous papers , based on older x - ray data , that the x - ray emission is insufficient to heat the observed warm h@xmath1 emission over the area of the whole filament ( appleton et al .",
    "2006 ; cluver et al .",
    "however , since then , new , much deeper _ chandra _ data have become available , which included a 97 ksec observations ( osullivan et al .",
    "2009 ) which have sufficient depth and spatial resolution to allow a direct comparison with our [ cii ] and h@xmath1 data extracted over our 18.8 x 18.8 arcsecs@xmath2 pacs apertures .",
    "the results of the x - ray temperature and abundance fits to the x - ray spectra allow us to obtain reliable x - ray luminosities over these areas ( see table 6 ) . from these results",
    ", we can show that the [ cii ] to x - ray luminosity ratio , l([cii])/l@xmath44 , varies from 3 to 11 depending on the region .",
    "thus the x - ray emission is far too faint to explain both the warm h@xmath1 and the [ cii ] emission , since the efficiency for heating gas by x - rays is a few percent at most .",
    "only if the x - ray flux was underestimated significantly , could x - rays be the main heat source .",
    "this is unlikely since fits to the x - ray data do not suggest a large intervening column , nor does the observed h@xmath1 emission seen in the iram observation have enough column density to provide significant x - ray obscuration .",
    "thus we can be confident that the x - rays are not the primary heating source for the main cooling lines .",
    "it has been known for many years that c@xmath25 ions can be excited in photo dissociation regions ( pdrs ) in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "the dominant mechanism is believed to be the heating of gas by photo - electric ejection of electrons from pah molecules and small grains . the warm gas ( mainly the abundant hi and h@xmath1 )",
    "would then excite [ cii ] emission collisionally .",
    "various authors have provided evidence that pahs dominate over both small and large grains in terms of photoelectric heating efficiency @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one direct measure of the efficiency of photoelectric heating is the flux ratio of the [ cii ] to total emission from pah features in the mid - ir spectrum [ cii]/pah@xmath7 .",

    "the plot emphasizes the unusually large ratios of [ cii]/pah@xmath7 in the sq shock compared with normal diffuse emission in the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "our measured values of [ cii]/pah@xmath7 ratio range from values of 17 - 18@xmath13 ( region a and d ) to 40 to 70@xmath13 in regions b , c and e. the large [ cii]/pah ratios we observe , especially in region e , strongly argues against heating of the [ cii ] emission by photoelectron from pah molecules in a diffuse uv field as the primary mechanism for the [ cii ] emission , since the efficiency of the photoelectric effect would have to be unusually large to explain the observed result .",
    "@xcite showed that the 24@xmath0 m _ spitzer _ emission from the molecular shock is very weak , perhaps even absent at the shock - center ( near region c ) suggesting a dearth of small grains .",
    "this can now be quantified more exactly with the new combined _ herschel _ and _ spitzer_-derived sed @xcite .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m point for region e ( scaled to the 160@xmath0 m resolution  red - point in lower panel of fig.5 ) shows that it is extremely low , in sharp contrast to the same point in region a known to contain some star formation ( upper panel of fig.5 ) .",
    "since small grains radiate most efficiently in the 20 - 30@xmath0 m range , it is unlikely that the [ cii ] emission could arise from photoelectric heating from small grains , since they seem depleted over much of the filament .",
    "most of the emission from region e comes from long - wavelength emission , presumably from larger grains where the photoelectric heating of [ cii ] is the most inefficient ( bakes & tielens ( 1994 ) .",
    "pacs region b , c and e also show unusually high [ cii]/fir ratios ( table 1 ) .",
    "these values ( [ cii ] between 6 - 7@xmath13 of the fir ) are much larger than that seen in the diffuse ism which is typically @xmath14 1@xmath13 , and exceeds by at least a factor of two the maximum theoretical efficiency for photoelectric heating of [ cii ] by small grains ( @xmath83@xmath13 ) discussed by @xcite .",

    "this suggests that the signature of shocked or turbulently heated gas can be masked by star formation  perhaps explaining why such large ratios are not commonly seen in galaxies with powerful star formation .    in fig.10 , we show one regime where the observations of the sq shock seems to fall closer to the norm seen in other galaxies . here",
    "we plot the [ oi]63@xmath0m/[cii ] ratio as a function of the fir dust color f(60@xmath0m)/f(100@xmath0 m ) from @xcite based on their work with iso for a set or normal galaxies .",
    "although the points lie to the extreme in color temperature ( we determine these colors from the sed fits of @xcite ) , the points seem to form an extension of those found for normal galaxies .",
    "recent spatially - resolved observations of m82 with pacs ( contursi et al .",
    "2013 ) show a tail of points which also extend into this region .",
    "they mainly arise in the cooler outer parts of m82 , with some points possibly being associated with the starburst wind .",
    "malhotra et al .",
    "interpreted their plot as an indication that [ oi ] is excited more , with respect to c@xmath25 , as the dust temperature rises .",
    "our results for sq appear to confirm that this trend remains true for the gas and dust in the sq filament , even though we have argued that process that excites the [ cii ] ( and presumably [ oi ] ) is not uv radiation in a pdr . in some ways",
    "this is unfortunate , because if one is confronted with far - ir diagnostics alone , it is hard to separate shock or turbulently induced gas from a low - density pdr , since both can exist as a diffuse , warm component in the ism .",
    "it is interesting to ask what contribution to the [ cii ] emission might be expected from a standard pdr ( solar abundance ) , given the low values of far - uv field strength g@xmath45 of 1.4 habing units in sq measured by guillard et al .",
    "such uv radiation must be present to ionize the carbon . based on the models of kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and adopting a reasonable density of @xmath8 10@xmath27 cm @xmath46 , this low g - field would be expected to contribute a surface brightness in [ cii ] emission of 1 - 2 @xmath32 10@xmath47 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath22 sr @xmath4 , or between 0.8 and 1.6 @xmath32 10@xmath21 w m@xmath22 , for the extraction apertures used in our pacs regions .",
    "thus , the uv radiation field necessary to ionize carbon would contribute between 10 and 15@xmath13 of the emission detected in the sq filament regions .",

    "( 2003 ) who found 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.76slightly super - solar .",
    "the differences may be due , in part , to the different methods used , but may also be due to the difficulty of measuring metallicity when the lines are broad and faint . if we accept that the higher velocity component in the [ cii ] and co profiles could be of lower metallicity , how might this effect our interpretation of the global ratios , such as [ cii]/pah and [ cii]/fir ?",
    "the answer is that the effect is minimal , since the average metallicity of the gas , integrated over the whole profile , is likely to be no less than 0.75 solar , especially as the lower - velocity component dominates the integral flux of the [ cii ] in most of the cases shown in figure 2 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , no large differences in the i([cii])/i(co j=1 - 0 ) ratio between the low and high velocity components are obvious , again suggesting that if the higher - velocity component in the [ cii ] profiles has reduced metallicity , it must also be compensated for in the co abundance .",

    "thus the h@xmath1o line may be gas that represents the material accelerated by the intruder galaxy to intermediate velocities .",
    "perhaps only this strongly accelerated gas is permeated by j - shocks .",
    "it is worth discussing a very different interpretation of the line seen in the fts spectrum of fig.3 .",
    "could the line be identified , not with the p - h@xmath1o line , but with ortho - h@xmath1o@xmath25 ( 1@xmath5 - 0@xmath6 ) which is seen in absorption in m82 ( wei et al . 2010 ) ?",
    "o - h@xmath1o@xmath25 has a transition at a rest frequency @xmath15 = 1115.186 ghz ( mrtz et al .",
    "1998 ) , which would be blue - shifted by 507 km s@xmath4 compared with p - h@xmath1o .",
    "this would place the line at a velocity of @xmath86000 km@xmath4 , close to the main peak in the co and [ cii ] profile for region c. a search for other h@xmath1o@xmath25 lines ( for example the one at 1108.404 and 1132.629 ) yielded no detection .",
    "nevertheless , could the detection of o - h@xmath1o@xmath25 be viable ?    as discussed by @xcite , h@xmath1o@xmath25 is part of the `` backbone '' of interstellar chemistry in the ism , and is a main formation route from h@xmath1 to h@xmath1o .",
    "in order for oh@xmath1o@xmath25 to be detected ( without a detection of h@xmath1o ) , the water would have to be very highly ionized .",
    "models of the abundance of ionized water under various conditions of photoionization and cosmic ray ionization are presented in figs.2 and 3 of hollenbach et al .",
    "what is noticeable is that in almost all cases considered , the abundance of oh@xmath25 is at least comparable , or larger than h@xmath1o@xmath25 , especially in the more diffuse environments .",
    "these authors consider cr ionization rates of up to 2 @xmath32 10@xmath57 s@xmath4 , which is comparable to the limiting ionization cases considered in section 5.4 . at this cr ionization rate",
    ", h@xmath1o would also be strong , and yet only one line is detected .",
    "the non - detection of the oh@xmath25 lines at 903.684 , 966.92 and 1026.903 ghz @xcite may argue against a highly ionized medium , and the h@xmath1o@xmath25 interpretation of the 1113 ghz line .",
    "the discovery of kinematically  broad group - wide [ cii ] emission that appears too bright to be explained by star formation ( either arising in hii regions or by diffuse pdrs ) in stephan s quintet is a strong reminder that [ cii ] can be relatively easily enhanced by processes other than uv heating .",
    "the fact that we see the signal without strong contamination from pdr emission , as well as sharing a similar velocity space with co ( 1 - 0 ) emission , suggests a close connection with the dissipation of kinetic energy in the group as the intruder crashes through the intergroup gas .",
    "the spatial extent of the observed [ cii ] emission covers most of the observational area of our pacs observations , and undoubtably extends over the whole of the shocked filament and the bridge to ngc 7319 .",
    "the large width of the [ cii ] line ( in some places @xmath3 1000 km s@xmath4 ) as well as its comparable power to the h@xmath1 0 - 0s(1 ) line suggests that a [ cii ] emission originating in a highly turbulent medium .",
    "a turbulent cascade from large - scale high velocity shocks created in the galaxy collision , to small - scale low - velocity shocks in the h@xmath1 gas can explain a large part of the [ cii ] emission .",
    "ogle et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and guillard et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have already demonstrated that radio galaxies are often hosts of very strong warm h@xmath1 emission , and that shocks and turbulence are the main cause ( see also nesvadba et al .",
    "2011 for additional evidence for shocks in 3c326 ) furthermore , very high h@xmath1 line luminosities have recently been found associated with the z = 2 `` spiderweb '' radio galaxy ( ogle et al .",
    "such strong emission is potentially associated with shocks within 60 kpc of the radio galaxy and surrounding satellite systems , which already shows strong filamentary h@xmath43 emission .",
    "thus objects like the `` spiderweb '' may be scaled - up versions of the sq phenomenon , and would be ideal places to look at higher - z for enhanced [ cii ] emission . in this respect , it is interesting that seymour et al .",
    "( 2012 ) claim a possible photometric detection of [ cii ] in their 500@xmath0 m band at a tentative level of [ cii]/fir = 2@xmath13 . follow  up of this possible discovery with line observations",
    "would be very interesting .",
    "observatories like alma are now capable of detecting highly redshifted [ cii ] emission from galaxies , sometimes with higher than expected [ cii]/fir ratios ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "although one explanation for the enhanced [ cii ] emission is that the star formation is quite extended , and the uv - field diluted , our observations of sq provide an alternative possibility  that at least some of the extra [ cii ] comes from the dissipation of mechanical energy in the systems . as we illustrate this in fig.9 , the regions of sq which contain known star formation show lower values of [ cii]/fir .",
    "there is no reason to believe that sq s filament is unique  it is simply one of the best known nearby examples of an isolated extragalactic shocked structure , quite separated from regions of strong star formation .",
    "we are currently reducing data on the taffy bridge system , which is also known to contain a strong shock signature ( peterson et al .",
    "2012 ) , and preliminary indications are that the bridge also emits strong [ cii ] emission .",
    "it is clear from our energy dissipation discussion in section 5.5 , that turbulence can deliver large amounts of energy to gas on a timescale comparable with star formation , and should not be neglected in violently collisional situations . in an environment where dark - matter halos are scaled up ( e. g. in massive radio galaxies or quasars ) more energy will be available for both star formation and dissipation of mechanical energy .",
    "unfortunately it is not clear how to separate the uv - heated gas from the shock - heated gas without more diagnostics than those available from a single high - z detection of [ cii ] . even if [ oi ] is also detected , as we showed in fig.10 , it is not easy to separate diffuse pdr emission from shock - induced [ cii ] emission , because both can lead to a diffuse , low density medium .",
    "in addition , there is the possibility of agn heating of the [ cii ] , which , like higher velocity shocks , will also boost the [ oi ] emission .",
    "the detection of strong molecular hydrogen cooling lines in high - z galaxies , with the proposed _",
    "spica _ telescope , or ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath1 with _",
    "jwst _ , may provide additional hope for separating pdr heating from turbulence and shocks .",
    "we have performed the first _",
    "herschel _ observations of the giant intergalactic filament away from major regions of star formation in the compact group , stephan s quintet .",
    "previous observations have provided strong evidence that the filament is the result of the supersonic collision between an intruder galaxy , ngc7318b and a pre - existing tidal tail in the group .",
    "our observations with the pacs and spire spectrometers lead to the following conclusions :    kinematically broad ( @xmath31000 km s@xmath4 ) far - ir fine structure lines of [ cii]@xmath10157.74@xmath0 m are detected from the giant shocked filament and bridge in stephan s quintet .",
    "weaker [ oi]@xmath1063.18@xmath0 m emission is also detected .",
    "the [ cii ] emission is very extensive , and can be decomposed into two or three different velocity components , many of which have fwhm ranging from a few hundred km s@xmath4 to 733 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the [ cii ] emission profiles at various positions in the filament are similar to co 1 - 0 emission detected with iram in similar areas , suggesting that the molecular gas and the [ cii ] emission are closely related .    based on a model of the heating and cooling of the [ cii ] and [ oi]-emitting gas ,",
    "our measurements of the cooling rates in the filament suggest the emission arises in a warm diffuse medium ( 90 @xmath14 t @xmath14 200 k , 10@xmath27 @xmath14 @xmath39 @xmath14 3 @xmath32 10@xmath27 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the temperature and mass of the gas involved is consistent with the main collisional partner of the c@xmath25 ion being the same warm molecular gas previously detected by _",
    "observations of the rotational h@xmath1 lines , which is believed to be shock - heated .",
    "the [ cii ] line emission exceeds by a factor of two in most cases the strength from the 0 - 0 s(1 ) warm molecular hydrogen line , and is typically 50 - 60@xmath13 of the total rotational line luminosity from molecular hydrogen ( 0 - 0s(0 ) to 0 - 0s(5 ) ) . in some regions [",
    "oi]63@xmath0 m carries about the same power as the 0 - 0s(1 ) line , whereas p - h@xmath1o is 28@xmath13 of the 0 - 0s(1 ) line in the area where the spire and pacs detectors overlap .",
    "thus the far - ir line - cooling from the giant filament is significant .",
    "warm molecular hydrogen is still the dominant coolant over the 6 rotational lines detected by _",
    "_    based on a careful comparison with previous _ spitzer _",
    "spectral mapping in the mid - ir , we find extremely large values of the ratio [ cii]/pah@xmath24 , ranging from 0.3 - 3 , and [ cii]/pah@xmath66 , ranging from 0.17 - 0.7 . similarly , unusually large value of [ cii]/fir ranging from 0.04 to 0.07 were found in the same regions using imaging data from _ herschel _ and _ spitzer _ to constrain the sed .",
    "the [ cii]/pah ratios are an important measure of the heating efficiency of the diffuse ism by photo - electric heating , and the observed values are so large that it is unlikely that most of the observed [ cii ] is emitted from pdrs .",
    "furthermore , we can rule out direct uv excitation from hii regions and x - ray heating .",
    "the strong enhancement of [ cii ] in the filament , relative to pah and dust continuum , suggests strong heating of the [ cii ] from shocks and turbulence , and not star formation .",
    "emission is also detected in several places from the p - h@xmath1o ( 1@xmath50@xmath6 ) line including the center of the giant filament . unlike the [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission from that position , the h@xmath1o emission is unresolved ( @xmath63v @xmath14 360 km s@xmath4 ) , and has a systemic velocity placing it in the mid - range of detected [ cii ] emission and at the same velocity are strong warm h@xmath1 detected by _",
    "spitzer_. the detection of h@xmath1o suggests that the sq filament contains regions of very high gas density ( @xmath3 10@xmath67 @xmath28 ) , supporting the idea that the structure of the filament is highly multi - phase . despite detection of the co 1 - 0 ,",
    "2 - 1 and 3 - 2 lines from the ground , no higher - order j lines of co or other h@xmath1o lines were detected with spire .",
    "we considered the possibility that the detected spire line was h@xmath1o@xmath25 , not h@xmath1o , but rejected this possibility because the high ionization rates needed to completely ionize water , would also be expected to ionize oh , forming oh@xmath25 , which is not detected .",
    "models @xcite of mildly ( g@xmath45@xmath81 ) uv - irradiated molecular gas show that the [ cii ] signal can be strongly boosted without a larger increase in [ oi ] emission in low - velocity magnetic shocks .",
    "although these models do not explain all the emission detected , the work strongly suggests shocks are playing a large role . in reality , the sq filament is likely permeated by a vast network of shocks ( as evidenced by the broad line - widths ) , including numerous low - velocity magnetic ( c- ) shocks traveling through molecular gas of relatively low density ( 100 - 1000 at @xmath28)a density which falls within the range we derive from the observations",
    ". these low - velocity shocks could be the natural consequence of turbulent energy dissipation initiated on much larger scales by the galaxy collision in the group .",
    "the possibility that [ cii ] can be excited on a large scale by the dissipation of mechanical energy ( turbulence and shocks ) provides a potential new source of [ cii ] emission when interpreting [ cii ] in high - redshift galaxies ( e. g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since , in this paper , there is strong evidence for a connection between the turbulent molecular gas in the sq shocked filament , and the [ cii ] emission ( both its distribution and kinematics ) , we suggest that enhanced [ cii ] ( and warm h@xmath1 emission ) from turbulent energy dissipation should be present in most situations where highly turbulent conditions exist  such as in galaxy collisions , and in the early stages of the building of galaxy disks",
    "however , as we have shown , the energy appears to be degraded down to very small scales and low - velocities , creating a warm diffuse gas component which is not easily distinguished from a low - density pdr .",
    "thus , the best places to disentangle mechanically - induced [ cii ] emission from uv - dominated heating will be in regions where turbulent processes are present , but star formation has not yet turned on .",
    "such conditions may exist in the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "pna would like to acknowledge interesting discussions with p. goldsmith and w. langer ( jpl ) regarding [ cii ] emission in the galaxy .",

    "<S> the h@xmath1o line is narrow , and may be associated with denser intermediate - velocity gas experiencing the strongest shock - heating . </S>",
    "<S> the [ cii]/pah@xmath7 and [ cii]/fir ratios are too large to be explained by normal photo - electric heating in pdrs . </S>",

    "<S> the observations lead to the conclusion that a large fraction the molecular gas is diffuse and warm . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the [ cii ] , [ oi ] and warm h@xmath1 line emission is powered by a turbulent cascade in which kinetic energy from the galaxy collision with the igm is dissipated to small scales and low - velocities , via shocks and turbulent eddies . </S>",

    "<S> the discovery that [ cii ] emission can be enhanced , in large - scale turbulent regions in collisional environments has implications for the interpretation of [ cii ] emission in high - z galaxies . </S>"
