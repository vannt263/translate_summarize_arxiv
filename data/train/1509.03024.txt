    "from the dry taps of mumbai to the dusty reservoirs of so paolo , urban water scarcity is a common condition of the present , and a likely feature of the future .",
    "hundreds of millions of people worldwide are connected to water distribution systems subject to intermittency .",
    "this intermittent water supply may take many forms , from unexpected disruptions to planned supply cycles where pipes are filled and emptied regularly to shift water between different parts of the network at different times  @xcite . in mumbai , for example ,",
    "vaivaramoorthy  @xcite reports that on average , residents have water flowing from their taps less than 8 out of 24 hours .",
    "intermittent supply is often inequitable , with low - income neighborhoods experiencing lower water pressure and shorter supply durations than high - income ones  @xcite .",
    "intermittent supply not only limits water availability , but also compromises water quality and damages infrastructure . with field data from urban india , kumpel and nelson",
    "@xcite quantified the deleterious effect of intermittency on water quality , showing that both the initial flushing of water through empty pipes  as well as periods of low pressure  corresponded with periods of increased turbidity and bacterial contamination .",
    "christodoulou  @xcite observed when that a drought in cypress ushered in two years of intermittent supply , pipe ruptures increased by 30%70% per year .",
    "whereas intermittent water supply creates challenges for water managers and water users , the phenomenon creates opportunities for applied mathematics .",
    "it is an interesting and difficult mathematical problem to efficiently model transient pipe flow in networks  including transitions to and from pressurized states  with uncertain or complex boundary conditions . in this work",
    "we introduce a framework to not only describe intermittent water supply , but also use optimization to improve either our description of the system , or the operation of the described system in order to reduce risks such as infrastructure damage .",
    "intermittent supply falls in somewhat of a modeling gap .",
    "water distribution software abounds , including the free and open source software epanet  @xcite produced by the us government , as well as many commercial packages  @xcite . yet",
    ", to the authors knowledge , all these fail to account for filling , emptying , and instances of subatmospheric pressure  phenomena that are vitally important for users and managers dealing with intermittent supply .",
    "sewer system software such as the storm water management model ( swmm )  @xcite and illinois transient model ( itm )  @xcite to some extent handle the physics of interest , but are packaged in elaborate graphical user interfaces and are not readily amenable to model improvements or optimization .",
    "furthermore , the authors have encountered a relative paucity of research work dealing with modeling intermittent supply .",
    "the work of de marchis  @xcite explicitly studies filling and emptying in a water distribution system in palermo , italy , but with a method of characteristics implementation of the classical water hammer equations .",
    "this treatment assumes pipes are either entirely dry or entirely full , and that air pressure inside the pipes is always atmospheric .",
    "after calibrating a friction parameter , they found about 5% agreement with empirical data .",
    "subsequent work reported by de marchis  @xcite uses the same model to assess losses in the distribution system .",
    "freni  @xcite , uses this model to determine pressure valve settings to reduce distribution inequality , but through scenario comparison rather than optimization . for sewer flow ,",
    "sanders  @xcite presents a network implementation of the two - component pressure approach ( tpa ) of vasconcelos  @xcite .",
    "the modeling for itm was published by len in  @xcite .",
    "urban water drainage is coupled to free surface flow by borsche and klaar  @xcite .",
    "note that buosso et al .",
    "@xcite give a general review of the storm water drainage literature with more details than we have provided here .",
    "the present work comprises an effort to address the scarcity of tools available for those interested in modeling the details of intermittent supply , and to specifically incorporate such tools within an optimization framework .",
    "we use an underlying model of coupled systems of one - dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws that strikes a balance between real - world relevance and both computational and theoretical tractability .",
    "our computational framework will allow for straightforward implementation of alternative physical models in future studies .",
    "the preissman slot formulation  @xcite is used to describe flow within each pipe , building on existing literature for transient , transition flow in closed conduits .",
    "the flow is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible .",
    "the dynamical description considers depth - averaged flow within a modified geometry that permits a single set of equations to describe both free - surface and pressurized flow .",
    "consideration of one - dimensional dynamics is a reasonable approximation given that the ratio of pipe diameter @xmath0 to pipe length @xmath1 is 1% or smaller in realistic scenarios ."
