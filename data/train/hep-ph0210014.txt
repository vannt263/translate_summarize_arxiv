    "the structure of the weak axial n-@xmath0 transition currents is ideally probed in neutrino or charged - lepton scattering experiments on deuterium or hydrogen .",
    "the experimental efforts so far have been focused on the determination of the dipole axial mass parameter @xcite , without an attempt to break down the transition current into form - factors @xcite .",
    "although a number of phenomenological predictions for the dominant coupling @xmath4 exist ( see table  i of @xcite for an exhaustive list ) , the dependence of the form - factors on momentum transfer is very poorly known .",
    "data on the non - leading form - factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 are especially scarce @xcite . new information on the weak axial form - factors is expected from parity - violating electron scattering experiments planned at jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigation of axial transition amplitudes in different versions of the quark model is of particular interest since it may reveal the importance of non - quark degrees of freedom in baryons , in particular the chiral mesons . yet , except for the calculation in the non - relativistic quark model @xcite , there exist almost no model predictions for the axial transition amplitudes .",
    "this can be traced back to the difficulty of incorporating consistently the pion field which is necessary to describe the proper low-@xmath7 behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "the lack of experimental and theoretical knowledge in the weak sector is in contrast to the case of electro - excitation of the @xmath0 resonance , which has been extensively studied theoretically in the constituent quark models @xcite as well as chiral models @xcite , and experimentally @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have pointed out the important role played by the pion cloud in the determination of electro - production amplitudes , in particular to the e2/m1 and c2/m1 ratios .",
    "this has later been confirmed in other chiral models @xcite and dynamical approaches @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study some general properties of the axial amplitudes in chiral quark models and present theoretical predictions in two typical representatives of such models , the linear @xmath3 model with quarks and the cloudy bag model .",
    "we derive a set of constraints on the pion field which enforce the proper behaviour of the amplitudes in the vicinity of the pion pole .",
    "we also address the long - standing problem of a too low @xmath2 coupling constant which rather systematically appears in all quark models . comparing the results in the two models we are able to draw some general conclusions regarding the contribution of chiral mesons to the weak amplitudes as well as to the strong @xmath2 form factor .",

    "the pole behaviour of the @xmath31 amplitude suggests that it is related to the term in the axial current responsible for the pion decay , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the pion decay constant .",

    "evaluating the commutators using ( [ hchi ] ) for @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath53 the sources on the rhs of ( [ virn])-([virdn ] ) consist of the quark term and the term originating from the meson self - interaction ( if present ) : @xmath54    these relations hold for the exact solutions of ( [ hchi ] ) . in an approximate computational scheme",
    "they can be used as constraints .",
    "we now show an important property of the axial transition amplitudes between states which satisfy these virial relations .",
    "we split the axial current into the non - pole and the pole part , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 since the pole part involves only the pion field we can use ( [ virdn ] ) to evaluate its contribution to the amplitudes .",
    "note that ( [ virdn ] ) is equivalent to ( [ pidn ] ) since in our model we can write the strong @xmath57-@xmath0 transition form - factor as @xmath58 we find @xmath59 and @xmath60 the pole term ( [ apole ] ) contributes only to @xmath31 , @xmath61 while @xmath62 .",
    "we conclude that in models in which the pion contribution to the axial current has the simple form @xmath63 and the pion field satisfies the virial relation ( [ virdn ] ) _ there is no pion contribution to the @xmath64 and @xmath1 amplitudes _ while @xmath31 is almost entirely dominated by the pion pole . in such models only the quarks contribute to the @xmath64 and @xmath1 amplitudes . in this respect ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 in a constituent quark model calculation ( e.  g.  @xcite ) , is still legitimate .",
    "the linear @xmath3-model assumes the following form of @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the quark bispinor for the valence orbit ( assumed to be different for the nucleon and the @xmath0 ) , and @xmath69 .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the coupling strength @xmath70 related to the `` constituent '' mass of the quark @xmath71 , and the mass of the @xmath3 meson @xmath72 .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to the description of the nucleon and @xmath0 properties .",
    "so far the physical states have been constructed from the mean - field solution using either cranking @xcite or the peierls - yoccoz projection @xcite . in the latter method",

    "the mean - field solution fulfills the diagonal virial relations ( [ virn])-([vird ] ) but not the off - diagonal relation ( [ virdn ] ) . to satisfy this relations",
    "it is necessary to include a channel representing the @xmath0 decay , i.e. a term that asymptotically represents the nucleon and a free pion .",

    "the properties of the ground state are dominated by the first term in ( [ n2mode ] ) , and imposing the off - diagonal constraint influences only slightly the results . for the @xmath0 ,",
    "the inclusion of the decaying channel modifies the long - range behaviour of the pion field , and yields the correct low-@xmath7 behaviour of the transition amplitudes as explained in the previous section .",
    "the calculated @xmath0-@xmath57 splitting is typically only @xmath84 of the experimental value . in order to make a sensible comparison of the transition amplitudes with the experimental ones , it is necessary to have the correct kinematical relations in the model",
    "this can be achieved by including an additional phenomenological term in the hamiltonian mimicking either the chromo - magnetic or the instanton - induced interaction between quarks and adjusting its strength such as to bring the @xmath0-@xmath57 splitting to the experimental value .",
    "we calculated the amplitudes in two models : in the linear @xmath3-model and in the cloudy bag model . in the cloudy bag model",
    "we assume the usual perturbative form for the pion profiles @xcite using the experimental masses for the nucleon and @xmath0 , which fulfills the virial constraints ( [ virn])-([virdn ] ) .",
    "since the pion contribution to the axial current in the cloudy bag model has the form of the pole term in ( [ apole ] ) , only the quarks contribute to the @xmath1 and @xmath64 amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes ( [ defs])-([defl ] ) are defined between states with good 4-momenta @xmath85 and @xmath13 respectively while in the model calculations localised states are used .",
    "we can use such states in our calculation of amplitudes by interpreting them as wave packets of states with good linear momentum . extending the method explained in @xcite we find for a chosen component of the axial current evaluated between localised states ,",
    "@xmath86 : @xmath87 here the matrix element of ( [ aexp ] ) is taken on the lhs and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are ( normalised ) functions describing the center - of - mass motion of the localised solution for the nucleon and the @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the spread of the wave packet is of the order of the inverse baryon mass ( @xmath90 ) and use for simplicity the same spread for the nucleon and the delta .",
    "the adler form - factors of ( [ c6])([c4 ] ) are then modified in such a way that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are multiplied by the factor @xmath93 , while @xmath94 - { m_n^2\\over2m_\\delta^2}\\,c_5^\\mathrm{a } \\>{. } \\label{c4wp}\\ ] ] we have neglected terms of the order @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , the strong @xmath96 form factor ( [ gpind ] ) acquires the same correction factor .",
    "the essential property that the pole contribution cancels out in @xmath97 and @xmath98 still persists as well as the relation ( [ c6pole ] ) for @xmath99 .     in the linear @xmath3-model .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath100 at @xmath101 @xcite is based on data from anl and bnl @xcite . the error ranges are given by the spread in the axial - mass parameter @xmath102 as determined from neutrino scattering experiments ( broader range ) and from electro - production of pions @xcite ( @xmath103 , narrower range ) .",

    "the @xmath4 is @xmath107 higher than the experimental estimate , while the @xmath102 from a dipole fit to our calculated values matches the experimental @xmath102 to within a few percent .",
    "we note that for the nucleon we obtain @xmath108 which is roughly the same amount higher than the experimental value of @xmath109 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we determine @xmath110 from the calculated strong @xmath2 form - factor using the goldberger - treiman relation ( [ gt0 ] ) we obtain a better agreement , yet with a steeper fall - off corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "the discrepancy between the two calculated values ( @xmath112 at @xmath113 where ( [ gt0 ] ) holds ) is a measure for the quality of our approximate computational approach .",
    "it can be attributed to a too large meson contribution originating from the last two terms in ( [ anp ] ) . since in this model",
    "only the meson fields bind the quarks it is reasonable that their strength is overestimated in the variational calculation .",
    "the effect of the meson self - interaction ( the second term in ( [ jt ] ) ) is relatively less pronounced in the strong coupling constant ( only @xmath114 ) than in @xmath110 .",

    "still , the ratio @xmath118 is considerably higher than either the familiar su(6 ) prediction @xmath119 or the mass - corrected value of @xmath120  @xcite , and compares reasonably well with the experimental value of @xmath121 .",
    "this improvement is mostly a consequence of the renormalisation of the strong vertices due to pions .",
    "the value of @xmath1 grows with @xmath70 and @xmath72 in contrast to @xmath96 which remains almost constant over a large range of model parameters . in our calculation",
    "we can not use much lower values for @xmath70 since the solution becomes numerically unstable .     in the cloudy bag model for three values of the bag radius .",

    "the ratio @xmath126 is close to the model - independent prediction of @xcite",
    ".    the large discrepancy can be to some extent attributed to the fact that the cloudy bag model predicts a too low value for @xmath127 , and consequently @xmath96 .",
    "taking a smaller value of @xmath128 in order to increase the strong coupling constants does not improve the results since @xmath128 on the rhs of ( [ gt0 ] ) compensates for the change in @xmath96 .",
    "we have found that the pions increase the @xmath129 ratio by @xmath130 through vertex renormalisation .",
    "the effect is further enhanced by the mass - correction factor @xmath93 , yet suppressed in the kinematical extrapolation of @xmath131 to the @xmath132 limit .",

    "we have derived a set of constraints which ensures the proper treatment of the pion pole dominating the transition at low @xmath7 . though there is a rather strong discrepancy between calculated amplitudes in the two models considered here",
    ", we are nonetheless able to draw some general conclusions about the role of the chiral mesons .",
    "the quark contribution alone strongly underestimates the @xmath98 amplitude .",
    "models in which only a linear coupling of pions to quarks is added do not improve the situation since in such a case the pion term in the axial current does not contribute to the amplitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of meson self - interaction which allows for a substantial deviation of the @xmath3 field from its vacuum value inside the baryon considerably increases @xmath98 .",
    "the linear @xmath3-model seemingly overestimates this contribution as it could have been anticipated from the overestimate of @xmath143 obtained in this model .    regarding the ratio @xmath129 we find that it is the pion cloud which enhances its value compared to the @xmath132 value of @xmath119",
    "; in the linear @xmath3-model as well as in the cloudy bag model for smaller bag radii the ratio is greater than @xmath144 and not far from the experimentally determined value of @xmath121 .",

    "a similar trend is also seen in the cloudy bag model for bag radii above @xmath146 .",
    "the popular assumption in which the same value for the strong and axial cut - offs are taken is therefore not supported by the two models .",
