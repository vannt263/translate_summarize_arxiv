    "the study of correlated systems with orbital ordering ( oo ) is currently a very active field of research in solid state physics .",
    "orbital ordering is not only accompanied ( or caused ) by structural transitions , but it also largely determines magnetic properties of many materials , e.g. , transition metal ( tm ) oxides : according to the goodenough  kanamori  anderson rules  @xcite the orbital occupation largely determines the magnitude and even sign of exchange interaction . by modifying orbital occupation one can control magnetic properties of a system  @xcite . besides more traditional electron - lattice ( jahn  teller ) mechanism  @xcite of oo , also a purely electronic ( exchange ) mechanism can lead to both orbital and magnetic ordering  @xcite , which appear to be coupled .",
    "the coupled spin and orbital ordering depends not only on electronic structure of constituent ions , but also on the local geometry of the system .",
    "the most often treated case is the system with a transition metal ion ( m ) surrounded by the ligand ( e.g. , oxygen , o ) octahedra , with these neighboring mo@xmath0 octahedra having one common oxygen ( common corner ) with the m  o  m angle of about @xmath3 ( it may also be smaller than @xmath3 , but small deviations of this angle from @xmath3 do not play an important role , see , e.g. , book  @xcite ) .",
    "this situation is met , for example , in such important systems as perovskites , e.g. , cmr manganites ( lasr)mno@xmath4 or in high - t@xmath5 cuprates like ( lasr)@xmath6cuo@xmath7 . for this case",
    ", one knows a lot : what is the form of electron ",
    "lattice ( jahn  teller ) interaction leading to the orbital ordering and how the spin exchange looks like .",
    "the general conclusion reached in the study of these systems is that ferro - orbital ordering usually leads to the antiferromagnetic spin ordering , and _",
    "vice versa _ antiferro - orbital ordering gives rise to the ferromagnetic spin exchange .",
    "this `` rule '' became a kind of `` folklore '' and is used by many theoreticians and experimentalists to explain or predict the type of coupled spin and orbital ordering in various systems with different crystal structure .",
    "however , one has to realize that this `` rule '' was derived for this particular geometry , and it does not have to be fulfilled in other cases .",
    "thus , for example , it is not the case for neighboring mo@xmath0 octahedra having two common oxygens ( common edge ) with the m  o  m angle of about @xmath8 .",
    "there are a lot of interesting and important materials with this local geometry , e.g. , the `` battery material '' licoo@xmath6 , many frustrated systems , multiferroics , etc .",
    "( one should note right away that here the deviations from the `` pure '' @xmath8 m  o  m angle may have more drastic consequences ) . as we will discuss below",
    "( see also @xcite ) , thus general `` rule '' is strongly violated in this case .",
    "there exists also much less studied `` third case '' of neighbors with three common oxygens , the systems with mo@xmath0 octahedra sharing common face . to understand the systematics of coupled spin and orbital ordering in these different cases",
    "is an interesting and practically important problem , which will be discussed in this paper .",
    "in addition to the local m  o geometry , which is crucial for the superexchange originating from the virtual hopping of @xmath9 electrons via ligands , e.g. oxygens , in the second and the third cases ( common edge and common face ) , in contrast to the simpler case of common corner , electron hopping leading to superexchange can occur not only via ligands , but there may exist also significant direct overlap of certain @xmath9 orbitals of neighboring tm ions .",
    "the resulting direct exchange should be also taken into account in certain cases ; it can lead to very nontrivial effects  @xcite .",
    "one more factor , important especially for heavy ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) transition metals and attracting much attention nowadays , is the role of the relativistic spin  orbit coupling ( soc ) , which for these elements could be very significant and which could sometimes dominate the properties of corresponding systems . in this paper",
    ", we consider these effects for different geometries .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sections 2 and 3",
    ", we shortly summarize the known properties of spin and orbital exchange for the geometries with common corner ( m  o  m angle of about @xmath3 ) and common edge ( @xmath8 m  o  m bonds ) .",
    "in particular , we want to stress here several important features , which distinguish these two cases .",
    "we also compare the situation in these two cases for systems with strong spin  orbit coupling .",
    "then , in sections 4 and 5 , we discuss the much less studied case of systems with common face of neighboring mo@xmath0 octahedra , using partially the results of our recent paper  @xcite , generalizing those for the case a finite noncubic crystal field and also for that of significant spin  orbit coupling .",

    "for one electron per site and for the strongly interacting case ( with the hubbard on - site electron repulsion @xmath29 far exceeding the electron hopping integral @xmath30 ) the usual treatment in perturbation theory in @xmath31 leads to the following schematic form of the exchange hamiltonian @xmath32 where the summation is taken over the nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath33 is the spin of site @xmath34 , and the pseudospin operators @xmath35 describe orbital state for the case of double orbital degeneracy ( say , for @xmath12 levels ) .",

    "similarly , one can obtain the effective spin  orbital model for triply - degenerate @xmath15 electrons , which , instead of pseudospin-@xmath42 orbital operators @xmath43 would contain effective orbital @xmath44 operators , @xmath45 , describing three @xmath15 states  @xcite .",
    "in general case , these operators would enter not only as @xmath46 , but with invariants of the type @xmath47 or @xmath48 , etc .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , for the doubly degenerate case in simple lattices such as that of perovskites amo@xmath4 with mo@xmath0 octahedra having common corner [ one common oxygen , with the m  o  m angle @xmath49 , see fig .  [ corner_sharing](a ) ] , the typical situation is that the ferro - orbital ordering gives rise to the antiferromagnetic spin exchange , whereas antiferro - orbital ordering is rather favorable for spin ferromagnetism .",
    "however , one has to realize that this conclusion was reached for particular cases , for systems with particular geometry , with @xmath3 m  o  m superexchange , and the situation is very different for other cases , as will be demonstrated below .",
    "we conclude this section by presenting the results for this geometry in the case of the strong spin  orbit coupling . the soc is quenched for @xmath12 electrons , see , e.g.  @xcite , but the interesting and nontrivial results can occur for partially filled @xmath15 levels .",
    "however , just this is the typical situation for 4@xmath9 and 5@xmath9 compounds for which soc is strong : due to large cf splitting @xmath50 and smaller hund s energy ( hund s rule coupling @xmath51 is @xmath52ev for 3@xmath9 elements , @xmath53ev for 4@xmath9 , and @xmath54ev for 5@xmath9 ) these ions are usually in the low - spin state , i.e. their electrons first fill @xmath15 levels , and only for @xmath55 electrons start to occupy @xmath12 levels . for these cases ,",
    "sometimes one can project electronic states to the ground - state multiplets calculated including soc .",
    "here , one has to discriminate between the cases with different electron occupation ( less than half - filled @xmath15 shell , @xmath56 , and more than half - filled shell , @xmath57 ) . the second ( or the third ) hund",
    "s rule for partially - filled @xmath15 shells tells us that the ground state multiplet for @xmath56 corresponds to the maximum possible total momentum @xmath38 , and for the case of more than half - filled @xmath15 shell  to minimum possible @xmath38 . in effect , e.g. for dominating soc , the ions with the @xmath58 configuration ( ir@xmath59 , os@xmath20 ) would have as a ground state a kramers doublet @xmath60 ( for @xmath15 triplet @xmath61 , @xmath21 , which gives @xmath60 doublet as a ground state ) , which can be described by the effective spin @xmath62 ( usual pauli matrices )  @xcite .",
    "the superexchange then can be projected onto this subspace and written through pseudospin @xmath60 operators .",
    "the form of this exchange for strongly localized electrons ( @xmath63 ) has been obtained for perovskites with 180@xmath64 exchange , e.g. sr@xmath6iro@xmath7 , and for 90@xmath64 exchange , e.g. for na@xmath6iro@xmath4 , in ref .",
    "the resulting exchange interaction in terms of @xmath60 looks very different : it is predominantly heisenberg - like for @xmath3 bonds , but is strongly anisotropic ( ising - like ) for each ir  o  ir pair in case of iro@xmath0 octahedra with common edge oxygens .",
    "indeed , for the case of corner - sharing octahedra , the dominant exchange has a simple heisenberg form  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the pauli matrices describing effective spin 1/2 for the @xmath60 kramers doublets .",
    "we see that the strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling can effectively remove orbital degeneracy , and instead of the complicated spin ",

    "@xcite ) , one obtains the simple heisenberg interaction  .",
    "however , whether in real cases we indeed meet the situation , in which the soc really dominates , is a special question , which should be addressed for each specific system .",
    "another typical situation in tm compounds is that with neighboring tm ions having two common oxygens ; for systems with mo@xmath0 octahedra this is the case of common edge , with @xmath67 m  o  m bonds , see fig .",
    "[ edge_sharing ] ( note that here instead of oxygens there may be other ligands : halogens such as f , cl , or s , se , te , etc . ) .",

    "let us now consider , which modifications can we expect in the case of trigonal splitting of @xmath15 states , and also what one could have for other electron occupations .",
    "note that the treatment below deals with one - electron levels , i.e. it effectively corresponds not to @xmath178 ( russel  sounders ) , but to @xmath179 coupling .",
    "this is actually the assumption implicitly made in most treatment of systems with strong soc like iridates , although it is not always stated explicitly .    as mentioned above , for systems with common face ,",
    "the trigonal splitting of @xmath15 levels is very typical .",
    "the detailed treatment of this situation is given in appendix .",
    "here , we summarize and qualitatively explain the main findings .",
    "as can be shown , inclusion of both ( strong ) soc and trigonal cf leads to the structure of levels shown in fig .",
    "[ figso ] . typically , except some isolated points in parameter space , @xmath15 levels are split into three kramers doublets ( for the cubic cf , the doublets @xmath165 and @xmath166 in fig .  [ figso ] are degenerate and combine into a @xmath180 quartet ) .",
    "if we have e.g. the system like ir@xmath59 ( @xmath58 ) , we would have one electron at the @xmath167 doublet . in general",
    ", the wave functions of this doublet would be different from those of unsplit @xmath15 triplet . nevertheless , at least for large @xmath15@xmath12 splitting 10@xmath181 ( ignoring possible admixture of `` real '' @xmath12 states ) , these would be all composed of the superposition of @xmath15 functions  or of functions with @xmath182 and @xmath183 , in the form @xmath184 with @xmath185 and @xmath186 . again , in general case , when we take into account that hopping matrix elements are nonzero only for diagonal hopping , @xmath187 , and non - diagonal hoppings are zero , @xmath188 , we finally obtain that also in this general case , we have the same symmetric situation , with @xmath189 .",
    "i.e. we have only a diagonal and equal hopping within the @xmath167 doublet .",
    "consequently , for this case , we would also get in general in the main approximation the simple heisenberg interaction ( 3 ) for this kramers doublet ( if indeed soc is strong enough so that this doublet is well separated from the @xmath165 and @xmath166 levels ) .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that electron hopping , on the one hand , preserves spin , @xmath190 , but also conserves the orbital moment , so that @xmath191 , and @xmath192 are nonzero , but hoppings with the change of orbital moment disappear , i.e. nondiagonal matrix elements are zero .",
    "this in effect is responsible for the realization of the symmetric model , which finally gives for very strong soc ( isolated doublet @xmath167 ) the heisenberg interaction .",
    "however , in the general situation , for arbitrary relation between soc and cf splitting and for other signs of this trigonal cf and other filling of @xmath9 levels , the situation could be very different and would require special treatment ( some basis for which is presented in appendix ) .",
    "in this paper , we presented a survey of the spin  orbital interaction for orbitally - degenerate mott insulators for different local geometries ( mo@xmath0 octahedra with common corner , common edge and common face ) , paying main attention to the `` third case '' of the common face , which , strangely enough , was practically not considered yet in the existing literature .",
    "the main message is that the general form and the details of the spin ",
    "orbital ( `` kugel  khomskii '' ) exchange interaction very strongly depends on this local geometry , so that the commonly accepted paradigm ( ferro - orbitals @xmath193 antiferro - spins , and _",
    "vice versa _ , antiferro - orbitals @xmath193 ferro - spins ) , derived for 180@xmath64 degree metal - oxygen - metal bonds ( common corner ) , is not valid in general .    rather surprisingly ,",
    "the `` third case '' of octahedra with common face turns out to be in some sense simpler and more symmetric than the other two situations , despite apparently more complicated local geometry ( exchange via three oxygens , with `` not simple '' m  o  m angle about 70@xmath64 , etc . ) .",
    "in particular , for doubly - degenerate case ( @xmath12 orbitals or @xmath116 doublet produced out of @xmath15 triplet by trigonal splitting , typical for this case ) the effective spin  orbital model has a highly symmetric form , i.e. it contains scalar products of both spin operators @xmath194 and orbital operators @xmath195 describing the orbital doublet .",
    "the resulting exchange has not only su(2)@xmath41su(2 ) symmetry dictated by these scalar products , but they enter with such coefficients that the resulting symmetry is even much higher  it is su(4 ) , the very nice theoretical model , which for example is exactly soluble in the 1d case , etc .",
    "thus the materials with mo@xmath0 octahedra sharing common face can be a good model systems to study possible manifestation of this high symmetry .",
    "similarly , local geometry largely determines the resulting form of the exchange in case of very strong spin - orbit coupling @xmath196  the situation typical for 4@xmath9 and 5@xmath9 systems . as is already known , for example for ions with @xmath58 configuration , such as popular nowadays ir@xmath59 , the exchange hamiltonian for the lowest kramers doublet @xmath60 has the heisenberg form for 180@xmath64 m  o  m bonds ( common corner ) , but it is highly anisotropic ( locally ising ) interaction for 90@xmath64 bonds ( common edge ) .",
    "again , the situation for systems with the common face turns out to be simpler in case of strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling too .",
    "the exchange for kramers doublets @xmath60 again has the heisenberg form , @xmath197 , where @xmath66 is the effective spin describing the @xmath60 doublet .",
    "we have also shown that the account taken of the trigonal splitting , very typical for the case of common face , does not change the situation qualitatively , although there appear definite quantitative changes .",
    "these situations considered above , although the most typical ones , do not exhaust all the variety of local geometries met in transition metal compounds .",
    "thus , tm ions can be not in o@xmath0 octahedra , but for example in o@xmath7 tetrahedra , like a sites in spinels or co ions in ybaco@xmath7o@xmath198 . or they may be in trigonal bipyramids ( mn in ymno@xmath4 ) or in prisms ( half of co ions in ca@xmath4co@xmath6o@xmath0 ) , etc .",
    "every such case requires special treatment , one can not uncritically transfer the know - how acquired in considering spin  orbital system in , say , perovskites to these cases .",
    "important conclusion is that this concerns not only these , more complicated cases , but also the situation with more conventional materials containing tm ions in o@xmath0 octahedra , may be more complicated than usually assumed .",
    "apart from the specific results for the `` third case '' of octahedra sharing common face , this warning is the main message of the present paper .",
