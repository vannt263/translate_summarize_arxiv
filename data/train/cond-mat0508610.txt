    "several states of matter are characterized by a rich energy landscape ( el ) , which , in turn , hints at peculiar structural and dynamical features .",
    "supercooled liquids , glasses , atomic clusters and biomolecules @xcite are typical examples of systems whose complex thermodynamic behavior can be traced back to the intricate topological properties of the el .",
    "the pioneering work by stillinger and weber on `` inherent '' structures of liquids @xcite revealed the importance of investigating the stationary points of the el for characterizing their dynamical and thermodynamic properties .",
    "similar approaches have been proposed and successfully applied to the identification of the structural  arrest temperature in glasses @xcite and supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "more recently , this kind of analysis has been extended to the study of protein models @xcite .",
    "they suggest that also the folding process of a protein towards its native configuration ( nc ) depends on the structure of its el .",
    "this has been found to possess a funnel  like shape : the nc is located inside the so  called native valley ( nv ) at the bottom of the funnel @xcite .    below the folding temperature , the evolution from a coil state to the nc",
    "is determined by the propensity of the protein to enter the relatively small fraction of states composing the nv without having to visit the entire phase - space . in a statistical sense",
    ", the folding process can be viewed as a weighted sampling mechanism which favours specific intermediate configurations .",
    "they correspond to assembling the building blocks which eventually constitute the nc .",
    "well above the folding temperature , no marked difference exists among the various states and the protein spends most of the time jumping between different random coil configurations .    in the absence of external forces",
    ", only thermal fluctuations can drive the protein dynamics through different regions of the el .",
    "in particular , below the folding temperature , the protein is expected to evolve mainly inside the nv .",
    "nonetheless , large deviations from the nc can not be avoided , but they are both rare and very short lived .",
    "this scenario was confirmed by simulations performed in a 2d off ",
    "lattice model@xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the model @xcite revealed that the protein dynamics can viewed as a sequence of jumps between pairs of minima separated by one saddle , that we call directly connected pairs ( dcp ) .",
    "each jump is a thermally activated process : the protein performs random oscillations in the basin of a local minimum until a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation allows it to overtake the energy barrier separating the minimum from a neighbouring one . in a high  dimensional space ,",
    "the transition rate can be computed as the product of the arrhenius factor times an entropic weight which depends on the dcp and on the saddle curvatures ( see section [ quattro ] ) . in other words",
    ", the relevant information about the protein dynamics can be obtained from the knowledge of the dcp and of the corresponding saddles . however , the reconstruction of the el is a very difficult task to be accomplished in practice .",
    "indeed , the identification of dcp by a systematic exploration of the entire set of the @xmath0 identified minima requires to exploring @xmath1 pairs , which is already on the order of @xmath2 for the partial database generated ( see the appendix for a description of the algorithm ) in the relatively small polypeptidic chains investigated in this paper ( see section [ due ] ) .",
    "it is therefore , crucial to develop effective strategies for identifying dcp within the set of all , a priori possible , candidates .",
    "this is the main issue addressed in this paper .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that the distance separating dcp is typically smaller than that between generic pairs of minima .",
    "it is therefore tempting to restrict the analysis to those pairs whose mutual distance is smaller than some prescribed threshold .",
    "however , whether this approach effectively works may depend on several factors one of which is the adopted definition of distance .",
    "for this reason , in section [ tre ] we introduce and compare different conformational distances .",
    "it turns out that the bond  angle distance , defined by the absolute  value norm is the one that makes the implementation of such a criterion most accurate in the identification of dcp .",
    "the price one has to pay is that , unavoidably , all dcp characterized by a distance larger than the given threshold are missed .",
    "the detailed analysis of the el dscribed in section [ quattro ] indicates that the average distance between dcp is larger for minima that are closer to the nc .",
    "accordingly , the computational advantage guaranteed by the choice of a relatively small threshold could be frustrated by the loss of important connections located in the nv .",
    "for this reason , we argue that the distance criterion has to be complemented by a systematic search of all dcp involving minima in the nv , a much more accessible task , given the limited number of such minima ( for an operative definition of the nv see section [ quattro ] ) .",
    "the model studied in this paper is a modified version of the 2d off - lattice model introduced by stillinger _",
    "_ @xcite and already investigated in ref .",
    "it consists of a chain of @xmath3 point - like monomers mimicking the residues of a polypeptidic chain . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "only two types of residues are considered : hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) ones .",
    "any chain is unambiguously identified by a sequence of binary variables @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 corresponds to h and p residues , respectively .",
    "the intramolecular potential is composed of three terms : a stiff nearest - neighbour harmonic potential , @xmath7 , intended to maintain the bond distance almost constant , a three - body interaction @xmath8 , which accounts for the bending energy and a long  range lennard - jones interaction , @xmath9 , acting on all pairs @xmath10 , @xmath11 such that @xmath12 @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the distance between the @xmath10-th and the @xmath11-th monomer and @xmath15 is the bond angle at the @xmath10-th monomer .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( both expressed in adimensional arbitrary units ) fix the strength of the harmonic force and the equilibrium distance between subsequent monomers ( which , in real proteins , is on the order of a few  ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is chosen to ensure a value for @xmath7 much larger than the other terms of potential ( [ v1 ] ) in order to reproduce the stiffness of the protein backbone .",
    "@xmath9 is the only term of the potential energy which depends on the nature of the monomers : the parameters @xmath19 are chosen in such a way that the interaction is attractive if both residues are either hydrophobic or polar ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) , while it is repulsive if the residues belong to different species ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath23 where , for the sake of simplicity , all monomers are assumed to have the same unitary mass and the momenta are defined as @xmath24 . despite its simplicity , this toy  model of a heteropolymer does reproduce the expected properties of polypeptidic chains and is thus very useful for testing dynamical and statistical indicators .",
    "for instance , accurate monte - carlo simulations , performed by employing innovative schemes  @xcite , have revealed that , in analogy with real proteins , only a few sequences systematically fold onto the same native structure : this is why they have been named  good folders \" @xcite .",
    "such studies have been confirmed and complemented by direct molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to investigating the three following sequences of twenty monomers ,    * [ s0 ] a homopolymer composed of 20 h residues ; * [ s1]=[hhhp hhhp hhhp phhp phhh ] a sequence that has been identified as a good folder in @xcite ; * [ s2]=[ppph hphh hhhh hhhp hhph ] a randomly generated sequence , that has been identified as a bad folder in @xcite .",
    "these sequences have been chosen because they represent the three classes of different folding behaviors observed in this model .",
    "the main thermodynamic features of all of them can be summarized with reference to three different transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "decreasing the temperature from high values , one first encounters the temperature @xmath25 below which the sequence is typically found in a collapsed configuration , rather than in a random - coil one @xcite .",
    "then , one finds the so ",
    "called folding temperature @xmath26 below which the heteropolymer stays predominantly in the native valley .",
    "finally , at even lower temperatures one finds @xmath27 : this is the glass - transition temperature , below which a structural arrest of the system occurs .    in the following we aim at a deeper understanding of the folding process by investigating directly the el structure of all these sequences .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the main problem for reconstructing the el amounts to finding dcp and the corresponding saddles of the potential energy @xmath28 ( see eq.([hamil ] ) ) .",
    "an exhaustive search of dcp among all pairs of minima rapidly becomes unfeasible with increasing the chain length @xmath3 , due to the exponential increase of the number of minima with @xmath3 itself @xcite .",
    "since the total number of dcp is a rather small fraction of all possible pairs ( see , e.g. , the table in the appendix ) , it would be very helpful finding an effective criterion to restrict the search of potentially directly connected minima .",
    "a priori , the _ distance _ seems to be the right indicator to discriminate between connected and not - contiguous pairs of minima . in this section",
    "we investigate several definitions of distance with the goal of identifying the most appropriate one to identify dcp .    as a first candidate",
    ", we introduce the generalized angular distance @xmath29 between configurations @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath10-th bond angle of the configuration @xmath34 .",
    "notice that this angular distance is much sensitive to local flucutuations along the chain .",
    "a generalized distance which depends more on the global than on the local structure of a configurations is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the intra ",
    "bead distance between @xmath10th and @xmath11th monomer of the configuration @xmath34 .",
    "this distance is related to the @xmath37-indicator , previously employed in the analysis of the folding dynamics in on and off  lattice models of heteropolymers in 2d and 3d @xcite . for @xmath38 , 2 , and @xmath39 ,",
    "both definitions of generalized distances reduce to the standard absolute ",
    "value , euclidean and maximum norms , respectively .",
    "such distances have been computed for all the pairs of minima in the databases of the sequences s0 , s1 and s2 .",
    "the algorithm used to generate the databases is described in the appendix .",
    "we want to point out that any numerical procedure , including ours , can not guarantee the identification of all minima and saddles in the el .",
    "nonetheless , we have independently verified that the algorithm allows obtaining at least a very accurate description of the native valley .",
    "then , we have computed the probability densities of the generalized distances between generic ( @xmath40 ) and directly connected ( @xmath41 ) pairs of minima . in all cases , @xmath42 has a bell shape with a maximum close to 1 , while @xmath43 is sharply peaked at much smaller values ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib ] , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are plotted for the sequences s0 , s1 and s2 ) .",

    "a fast convergence of @xmath53 to 1 means that almost all dcp can be already identified by limiting the search to relatively close pairs of minima .",
    "the data plotted in fig.[fig : int_distrib]a for s1 and @xmath38 indeed reveal such a fast growth of @xmath53 , that almost @xmath55 of the dcp can be obtained by investigating only @xmath56 of all pairs both by considering the angular @xmath57 and the global @xmath48 distance .",
    "the curves in fig.[fig : int_distrib]b show that significantly worse performances are obtained when the maximum norm ( @xmath58 ) is used to classify the pairs of minima . in order to clarify the role of the parameter @xmath47 , in figs.[fig : dang00],[fig : dang_etero ] , we have plotted @xmath53 versus @xmath54 for different values of this parameter . there we see that , upon decreasing @xmath47 from @xmath59 down to @xmath60 , @xmath53 exhibits an increasingly fast saturation , while the opposite is observed when @xmath47 is further decreased below @xmath60 .",
    "the bad performance observed at high @xmath47-values has a quite intuitive explanation : in that limit , the norm reduces to the maximum norm and the slow growth of @xmath53 tells us that distances between dcp are not uniformly small along all directions : dcp may significantly differ along specific directions in spite of being  on the average \" much closer than generic pairs of minima .",
    "the relatively bad performance observed for @xmath61 has a complementary explanation . in that limit",

    "however , considering the limited number of minima in the nv , such a difficulty can be easily overcome by complementing the overall application of the metric criterion with an extensive comparison of such minima with all configurations in the database : the additional cost in terms of the computing time is indeed a minor one .",
    "the increased distance between neighbouring minima hints at possibly deeper valleys and is , in turn , suggestive of the presence of a funnel in the el , a structure that is typically expected to appear in true proteins @xcite .",

    "the above expression has been shown to reproduce reasonably well the numerically obtained escape rates for heteropolymers in 2d at moderate temperatures for @xmath109 @xcite . accordingly , in that regime , both the folding and the unfolding dynamics towards and from the nc are driven by thermal activation processes , which determine the transitions between dcp .",

    "the saddle - searching strategy here proposed can then be viewed as an  all purpose \" method suitable for a complete exploration of all the features of the el relevant for protein dynamics .",
    "the data reported in this paper were obtained by applying the algorithm to an initial database of minima determined by the method described in ref .",
    "it amounts to performing a high - temperature ( typically above @xmath26 ) langevin dynamics , when the system is expected to visit a large portion of the accessible phase space .",
    "the resulting trajectory is then sampled to pinpoint a series of configurations , which are afterwards relaxed according to a steepest descent dynamics and finally refined by means of a standard newton s method .",
    "this procedure was used for identifying a small database of 50 - 100 collapsed states for each of the three sequences described in section [ due ] .",
    "all possible pairs in these initial minima databases were then searched for dcp by means of our saddle - finding algorithm .",
    "the new minima found during each run of the algorithm on all possible pairs were stored in the database to be investigated in successive runs .",
    "actually the number of pairs of minima grows much faster than the number of pairs investigated , thus making impossible a complete analysis .",
    "the number of minima and saddles that were identified after three runs is reported in table  [ statistica ] .    in order to perform a complete search of all dcp at least in a restricted set of minima",
    ", we have selected all configurations of energy lower than @xmath136 . in this restricted database",
