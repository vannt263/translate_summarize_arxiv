    "at temperatures below about 1 mk , atoms and molecules enter a fully quantal regime where their de broglie wavelength is large compared to molecular dimensions . in this regime ,",
    "collision cross sections and reaction rates are dominated by long - range forces @xcite and resonance phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is likely to be possible to _ control _ reaction rates by tuning scattering resonances with applied electric and magnetic fields @xcite . at even lower temperatures , below about 1 @xmath0k , trapped atoms and molecules form _ quantum gases _ such as bose - einstein condensates and fermi - degenerate gases , in which every molecule occupies the lowest allowed translational state in the trap .",
    "the quantum gas regime offers additional possibilities for a new form of quantum control , in which chemical transformations are carried out coherently on entire samples of ultracold atoms and molecules .",
    "there have been enormous advances towards these goals in the last few years . in particular",
    ", it is now possible to produce ultracold alkali metal dimers in their rovibronic ground states from ultracold atoms both by photoassociation @xcite and by magnetoassociation followed by stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "however , for an alkali metal dimer even the ground rovibronic state has nuclear spin hyperfine structure @xcite , and the resulting splittings are comparable to the kinetic energies involved in ultracold collisions . for the case of @xmath1k@xmath2rb , microwave transitions have been used to transfer the ground - state molecules selectively between different hyperfine and zeeman levels @xcite . in a very recent development ,",
    "et al._@xcite have studied reactive collisions of such state - selected molecules , both with one another and with ultracold k and rb atoms .",
    "they observed remarkable selectivity of the resulting reactions , in which flipping the spin of a single nucleus could cause dramatic changes in the outcome of a collision @xcite .",
    "methods that form molecules from ultracold atoms can be applied only in cases where the atoms themselves can be cooled . in practice",
    "this restricts them to the alkali metals , the alkaline earths , and a few other elements .",
    "these species have a fairly limited chemistry . in order to cool a wider class of molecules , including polyatomic ones , a number of _ direct _ cooling methods @xcite have been established over the last decade . among these methods ,",
    "_ buffer - gas cooling _ is based on the particularly simple idea of cooling molecules by elastic collisions with cold he gas .",
    "if the molecules are paramagnetic and in low - field - seeking states , they can be confined in a magnetic trap .",
    "the temperatures which can be achieved in buffer gas cooling method are limited by the vapour pressure of the buffer gas ( ca .",
    "400 mk for @xmath3he ) , but the method is particularly valuable for two reasons : ( i ) it is very general and can in principle be applied to any paramagnetic species , provided that a detection scheme is available ; ( ii ) it can produce large numbers and high densities of cold molecules .",
    "buffer - gas cooling has been reported for a variety of molecules including cah @xcite , caf @xcite , nh @xcite , crh and mnh @xcite and also for a number of paramagnetic atoms @xcite .",
    "buffer - gas cooling followed by evaporative cooling has recently been used to achieve bose - einstein condensation with no laser cooling for metastable helium @xcite .",
    "the direct methods established so far are limited to temperatures of 10 to 100 mk and above . to cool the molecules further , to the @xmath0k regime , second - stage cooling methods must be developed .",
    "the most promising and conceptually the simplest method is _ sympathetic cooling _ , in which the molecules are cooled by collisions with an atomic gas that can itself be cooled to the ultracold regime , such as an alkali metal .",
    "the most robust trapping methods for molecules work for low - field - seeking states , which are never the lowest possible state in an applied field .",
    "inelastic collisions can therefore occur , and either heat the trapped system or eject the molecules from the trap .",
    "sympathetic cooling can thus be successful only if elastic collisions dominate inelastic ones , and it is usually stated that the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections must be 100 or more .",
    "sympathetic cooling was initially developed as a cooling method for trapped ions @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been used to achieve sub - kelvin temperatures for polyatomic ions @xcite and has also been used to produce ultracold neutral atoms with scattering properties that are not suitable for evaporative cooling , such as @xmath4k @xcite .",
    "sympathetic cooling for molecules has not yet been achieved , but several proposals have been explored .",
    "it was initially proposed for nh molecules colliding with rb atoms @xcite and studied in more details by lara _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for oh colliding with rb .",
    "both oh and nh molecules interact very strongly with rb and the anisotropy of the interaction potential is large compared to the molecular rotational constant .",
    "the large anisotropy implies large couplings between channels with different @xmath5 ( monomer rotation angular momentum ) and @xmath6 ( end - over - end angular momentum ) quantum numbers , and lara _",
    "et al._showed that this resulted in large inelastic cross - sections in the ultracold regime .",
    "the remedies they suggested to improve sympathetic cooling and decrease inelastic cross sections were : ( i ) to use light atoms as coolants , in order to increase the heights of centrifugal barriers and suppress inelastic channels ; ( ii ) to find atom - molecule system with much smaller anisotropy in the interaction potential .",
    "soldn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the possibility of reducing the anisotropy by using alkaline - earth atoms ( ae ) as collision partners for nh molecules .",
    "they showed that the neutral states of ae  nh systems are coupled to ion - pair states ae@xmath7nh@xmath8 , with crossings between the neutral and ion - pair surfaces at linear geometries . for sr and ca atoms",
    "the crossings occurs at energies below the atom - molecule threshold , so will be accessible in low - energy collisions .",
    "however , for be - nh and mg - nh the crossings occurs at energies more than 1000 @xmath9 above the atom - molecule threshold . in these systems ,",
    "the ion - pair state is likely to be inaccessible , so it is reasonable to carry out collision calculations on a single covalent surface .",
    "in addition , the potential energy surface for mg  nh turned out to be only weakly anisotropic .",
    "wallis and hutson @xcite carried out quantum scattering calculations of spin relaxation collisions ( in magnetic fields ) and showed that sympathetic cooling of nh by collisions with mg atoms should be achievable if the molecules can be precooled to about 10  mk .",
    "sympathetic cooling has also been considered for nh@xmath10 and nd@xmath10 . in this case",
    "the molecules are initially slowed in a stark decelerator @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite surveyed the interaction potentials for nh@xmath10 interacting with alkali - metal and alkaline - earth atoms .",
    "uchowski and hutson @xcite then carried out quantum scattering calculations on collisions of nd@xmath10 with rb atoms and showed that molecules that are initially in the upper component of the ammonia inversion doublet are likely to undergo fast collisional relaxation to the ground state , and that this is likely to prevent sympathetic cooling of molecules trapped in low - field - seeking states in an electrostatic trap @xcite .",
    "however , there is a good prospect for sympathetic cooling of ammonia molecules in high - field - seeking states , even with magnetically trapped atoms , because the terms in the hamiltonian that might cause spin - changing collisions of the rb atoms are very small .",
    "high - field - seeking states of nd@xmath10 can be confined in an alternating current trap @xcite .",
    "recently , hummon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated buffer - gas cooling and trapping of n ( @xmath11s ) atoms and simultaneous co - trapping of nh molecules .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has demonstrated n atom densities around @xmath12 @xmath13 and lifetimes around 10  s. this offers the possibility of cooling the atoms further with atomic evaporative cooling , which has already been achieved for metastable helium and cr atoms @xcite .",
    "a gas of n atoms is potentially an excellent coolant for a sympathetic cooling experiment .",
    "the n atom has a very small polarizability compared to group i and group ii elements and this results in low @xmath14 coefficients and small anisotropies of the interaction potentials with molecules .",
    "the n atom also has a relatively low mass , which results in higher centrifugal barriers and stronger suppression of inelasticity for particles scattered with @xmath15 .",
    "this paper presents theoretical studies of cold and ultracold collisions of n atoms with nh molecules , in order to investigate the possibility of sympathetic cooling of nh by atomic nitrogen .",
    "since the cross sections depend strongly on the reduced mass of the collision system , we consider four isotopic combinations of n  nh systems , with each of the two n atoms being either @xmath16n or @xmath17n .",
    "we assume that both n and nh are initially in their magnetically trappable spin - stretched states , with the maximum possible values of the electron spin projection numbers . for such states only spin relaxation ( and not spin exchange ) can occur and only the sextet interaction potential contributes .",
    "we report calculations of the sextet potential for n  nh and explore the behaviour of cross sections as a function of collision energy and magnetic field .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the scattering results with respect to uncertainties in the interaction potential .",
    "finally , we analyze the behaviour of the shape resonances in terms of angular - momentum - insensitive quantum - defect theory ( aqdt ) @xcite .",

    "a very small barrier exists between the n@xmath23h complex and n@xmath23 + h products and overall the reaction of forming n@xmath23+h yields 6.33 ev of energy . to our knowledge , no studies of quartet or sextet states of n  nh have been published , though we are aware of work in progress by tscherbul and coworkers @xcite .    to obtain the sextet interaction potential we applied",

    "the largest contributions to the uncertainty of the interaction potential arise from the approximate treatment of electronic correlation and the incompleteness of the electronic basis set .",
    "we expect that the effect of the neglecting vibrations of the nh molecule is much less important , as are relativistic and nonadiabatic effects .",
    "first we need to estimate how well the uccsd(t ) method works for sextet n  nh . to explore this",

    "we included all electrons arising from the h atom and the @xmath27 electrons of n atoms .",

    "<S> we calculate the interaction potential between n atoms and nh molecules and use it to investigate cold and ultracold collisions important for sympathetic cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of elastic to inelastic cross sections is large over a wide range of collision energy and magnetic field for most isotopic combinations , so that sympathetic cooling of nh molecules by n atoms is a good prospect . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are important effects due to a p - wave shape resonance that may inhibit cooling in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> we show that scaling the reduced mass used in the collision is approximately equivalent to scaling the interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> we then explore the dependence of the scattering properties on the reduced mass and explain the resonant effects observed using angular - momentum - insensitive quantum defect theory . </S>"
