    "non - equilibrium phenomena in the presence of time - varying external fields are of vital interest in many areas of current research @xcite .",
    "examples are aging and rejuvenation effects in the rheology of soft - matter systems and in the dynamics of spin glasses , relaxation and transport processes in biological systems such as molecular motors , ion diffusion through membranes , or stretching of dna molecules , driven diffusion systems with time - dependent bias , and nano - engines .",
    "with minimization of the system size thermal fluctuations become increasingly relevant . in these systems",
    "it is useful to introduce microscopic heat and work quantities as random variables whose averages yield the common thermodynamic quantities",
    ". averages over functions of these microscopic heat and work quantities yield generalized fluctuation theorems @xcite . in this",
    "context mesoscopic engines operating between different heat baths under non - equilibrium conditions have received increasing attention .",
    "the variety of models can be roughly classified according to the dynamical laws involved . in the case of the classical stochastic heat engines ,",
    "the state space can either be discrete or continuous ( c.f .",
    ", for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "examples of the quantum heat engines are studied , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the traditional consideration of efficiency of heat engines operating between two baths at temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 leads to the carnot upper bound @xmath2 .",
    "the bound is only achieved under reversible conditions where the state changes require infinite time and hence the power output is zero .",
    "real heat engines generate a finite power output @xmath3 , i.e. , they perform work @xmath4 during a cycle of a finite duration @xmath5 .",
    "thus an appropriate way to characterize the engines is to compare their efficiencies at maximum power . on the macroscopic level",
    "this quantity is roughly bounded by the curzon - ahlborn value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "alternative expressions for quantifying efficiency have been discussed @xcite which are based on _ mean _ quantities , e.g. , on the mean work done during the operational cycle . on the mesoscopic level , the work is inherently a fluctuating quantity and one should be able to calculate not only its mean value but also its fluctuation properties .    in this paper",
    "we study a simple model of mesoscopic heat engines operating between two different heat baths under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the working medium consist of a two - level system .",
    "the cycle of operation includes just two isothermal branches , or strokes . within each stroke ,",
    "the system is driven by changing the energies of the two states and we assume a constant driving rate , i.e.  a linear time - dependence of the energies .",
    "the response of the working medium is governed by a master equation with time - dependent transition rates .",
    "the specific form of the rates guarantees that , provided the two energies were fixed , the system would relax towards the gibbs equilibrium state . of course , during the motor operation",
    ", the gibbs equilibrium is never achieved because the energies are cyclically modulated . at a given instant ,",
    "the system s dynamics just reflects the instantaneous position of the energy levels .",
    "after a transient regime , the engine dynamics approaches _ limit cycle _ with the periodicity of the driving force .",
    "we will focus on the properties of this limit cycle .",
    "in particular , we calculate the distribution of the work during the limit cycle .",
    "our two - isotherm setting imposes one important feature which is worth emphasizing . as stated above , at the end of each branch we remove the present bath and we allow the thermal interaction with another reservoir .",
    "this exchange of reservoirs necessarily implies a finite difference between the new reservoir temperature and the actual system ( effective ) temperature . even if the driving period tends to infinity , we shall observe a positive entropy production originating from the relaxation processes initiated by the abrupt change of the contact temperature .",
    "differently speaking , our engine operates in an inherently irreversible way and there exists no reversible limit .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ii ]",
    "we solve the dynamical equation for the externally driven working medium .",
    "for the sake of clarity we first give the solution just for an unrestricted linear driving protocol using a generic driving rate and a generic reservoir ( section  [ subsec : iia ] ) .",
    "thereupon , in section  [ subsec : iib ] , we particularize the generic solution to individual branches and , using the chapman - kolmogorov condition , we derive the solution for the limit cycle .",
    "in section  [ sec : iii ] we employ the recently derived @xcite analytical result for the work probability density under linear driving .",
    "again , we first give the result for the generic linear driving and then we combine two such particular solutions into the final work distribution valid for the limit cycle .",
    "the results from section  [ sec : ii ] and section  [ sec : iii ] enable a detailed calculation of the energy and entropy flows during the limit cycle in section  [ sec : iv ] and allow for a discussion of the engine performance in section  [ sec : v ] .",

    "the time evolution of the occupation probabilities @xmath10 , @xmath8 , is governed by the master equation @xcite with time - dependent transition rates specified by the reservoir temperature and by the external parameters . to be specific the dynamics of the system is described by the time inhomogeneous markov process @xmath11 assuming the value @xmath12 , @xmath8 , if the system resides at time @xmath13 in the @xmath12th state .",
    "explicitly , the master equation reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unity matrix and @xmath16 the transition matrix with elements @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",

    "similarly to the preceding section  [ sec : ii ] , the chapman - kolmogorov condition can be used to connect two different propagators describing the time evolution of the augmented process within two branches of the driving cycle . before we address this point , we focus on the generic situation .",

    "this is a hyperbolic system of four coupled partial differential equations with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "it can be derived in several ways .",

    ", the number of such paths can change due to two reasons .",
    "first , while residing in the given state , some paths enter ( leave ) the set , because the energy levels move and an additional work has been done . secondly",
    ", some paths can enter ( leave ) the described family because they jump out of ( into ) the specified state .",
    "these two contributions correspond to the two terms on the right hand side of equation  ( [ gdynequation ] ) .",
    "another derivation @xcite is based on an explicit probabilistic construction of all possible paths and their respective probabilities .",
    "similar reasoning holds for the random variable @xmath115 describing the heat accepted by the system from the environment , and for the internal energy @xmath116 .",
