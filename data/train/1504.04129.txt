    "sbs is a three wave process in which a strong pump field @xmath1 creates a co - propagating phonon field @xmath2 and a backwards propagating stokes field @xmath3 that is down shifted by the acoustic resonance frequency @xmath4 of @xmath5 . for the case of a single stokes wave the density fluctuations @xmath6 in the fibre",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath2 is the slowly varying acoustic field at frequency @xmath4 propagating in the @xmath8 direction with wave vector @xmath9 .",
    "the acoustic mode profile is given by @xmath10 and is assumed constant down the fibre .",
    "the phonon field @xmath2 acts to couple the pump and stoke s wave leading to the standard coupled amplitude equations : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the group velocity of the electric field at frequency @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the loss and @xmath15 represents the coupling strength .",
    "the acoustic wave propagates at a velocity of @xmath16 and is strongly damped by @xmath17 and is driven by the product of the electric fields through the electrostriction term represented by @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 represents the effective area of the fibre .    in analysing brillouin generation",
    "it is usual to make the assumption that the fields are time - independent and furthermore the spatial derivative of @xmath2 can be dropped due to the slow speed of the phonon field in which case eq .",
    "can be solved for @xmath2 and the usual equations for the power of the pump and stokes waves can be derived @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard brillouin gain and @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in fibres and in particular resonant brillouin lasers",
    "it is common that the stokes wave becomes sufficiently intense that it creates a second phonon wave and thus a second stokes wave that is co - propagating with the pump and offset by twice the acoustic resonance frequency ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "denoting the second acoustic wave by @xmath25 and the second stokes wave as @xmath26 we get the coupled equations : @xmath27 again in the time - independent case and when the spatial dervatives of the phonon waves can be neglected we can solve for @xmath2 and @xmath25 as @xmath28 substituting the expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath25 into the eq .   and assuming continuous wave interactions leads to the coupled power equations @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the power in the pump beam , @xmath31 is the power in the backwards propagating first stokes wave and @xmath32 is the power in the forward propagating 2nd stokes beam .",
    "we emphasise here that the correct equations are eqs .   rather than the coupled power equations which do not describe the full dynamics of the system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "furthermore once a third stokes wave is introduced , then as we will show below , it is no longer possible to write down a set of coupled power equations and thus any analysis that begins with such a set of equations is wrong .",
    "continuing the analysis from the previous section suppose that there are now @xmath33 brillouin lines generated in a fibre ( @xmath34 can be over 390 see for example ref .",
    "the fundamental question is how many acoustic waves are present in the fibre ?",
    "since each pair of lines both generate and are coupled by an acoustic wave it might initially appear that there are @xmath35 acoustic waves present of which @xmath34 are propagating in the forward direction and @xmath36 are propagating in the backward direction .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum implies that the frequency @xmath37 of the @xmath38 acoustic wave will be given by stokes shift between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 electromagnetic wave .",
    "thus we can write the total acoustic perturbation in the fibre as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the forward and backward propagating acoustic waves respectively .    in a fibre or waveguide",
    "the brillouin gain is relatively narrow ( @xmath43 in silica for example ) compared to the wavelength shift ( @xmath44 ) and so the standard assumption is that all of the brillouin lines are _ equally spaced in frequency _ implying that @xmath45 and thus the sums in eq .",
    "each collapse to a single term leading to the simplified expression @xmath46 for the acoustic field .",
    "we note that measurements of the brillouin shift in fibres for multiple cascaded brillouin lines has found that eq .",
    "is correct@xcite .",
    ".   represents the crux of our argument since if eq .   is correct",
    "then there are _ only 2 _ acoustic waves in the fibre : one propagating in the forward direction and one in the backwards direction .",
    "looking in the literature we have found only one paper by c. montes @xcite published in 1985 that discusses this situation ( in the context of plasma physics ) which he calls the strongly coupled case ( see eqs .",
    "4750 of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently ogusu @xcite for example keeps multiple acoustic waves despite the fact that he assumes that each brillouin shift is identical .",
    "this approach is followed by buttner et al .",
    "@xcite who in their supplementary information ( eq .",
    "s1 ) state that the each brillouin wave is shifted by an identical amount .",
    "a third recent example is yuan et al .",
    "@xcite who implicitly adopt this model in their numerical analysis of their results .",
    "we argue here that if there is only a single acoustic wave propagating in each direction in the fibre then it must be driven by multiple sets of interacting fields .",
    "this has important implications for the derivation of the correct set of equations to describe cascaded brillouin scattering .",
    "in particular it implies that unlike the case for 2 or 3 interacting waves coupled power equations can not be used and instead coupled equations for the fields are required and the correct equations which are a generalisation of the work of montes @xcite are presented below .    in line with the notation introduced above",
    "we denote the pump beam by @xmath1 , the backwards propagating stokes waves by @xmath47 and the forward propagating stokes waves by @xmath48 where @xmath49 runs from 0 to @xmath34 . using this notation",
    "the correct equations are : @xmath50 for the optical fields ( assuming an even number of fields ) .",
    "while the acoustic waves satisfy @xmath51 making the standard approximations for the acoustic waves leads to the equations for @xmath2 and @xmath25 : @xmath52 which can then be substituted back into the equations for the fields [ eq .  eq .  ] if desired . in that case",
    "it can be easily shown that the coupled equations conserve the total photon flux through the system .",
    "the new equations eq .   are the correct and obvious generalisation of the coupled equations for the case of two stokes waves when there are only two acoustic waves propagating in the fibre .",
    "however in the literature most authors have chosen , incorrectly , to generalised the coupled power equations [ eq .   eq  ] or equivalently to include a separate acoustic wave for each new pair of stokes waves .",
    "not surprisingly , since this fundamental physical picture of the interaction is wrong , it leads to an incorrect set of equations and thus the resulting analysis can not be trusted .",
    "we emphasise here the point made by montes in his original article that in case of more than 3 interacting optical fields it is not possible to write down coupled equations for the evolution of the power in the fields and rather the coupled amplitude equations must be used .",
    "a direct consequence of the presence of only two acoustic fields is that all optical fields are coupled together via the two phonon fields .",
    "an effect of this is to alter the threshold required to see multiple lines since each field has a growth term proportional to the pump @xmath1 ( forward propagating fields ) or its complex conjugate ( backward propagating fields ) .",
    "thus one would expect that there would be more brillouin lines in a resonator than would be expected using the analysis of ogusu for example .",
    "we are currently looking at numerically solving the full coupled equations and will present a more detailed numerical analysis of the difference between the two sets of equations in a later paper .",
    "we also note that it is relatively trivial to extend the above equations to include kerr nonlinear terms and also to describe ring resonators or fabry - perot cavities such as those treated by both buttner _",
    "et al . _ and by ogusu . treating a fabry - perot cavity",
    "requires that the number of optical fields is doubled since each stoke wave is reflected by the cavity mirrors giving rise to a forward and backward propagating wave at the same frequency .",
    "however even in this case the number of acoustic waves remains fixed at 2 and so we do not treat this case any further .    in conclusion",
    "we have highlighted a common error in the analysis of cascaded brillouin generation in optical fibres and presented the correct analysis based on correctly identifying the acoustic fields in the fibre ( following earlier analysis by montes ) .",
