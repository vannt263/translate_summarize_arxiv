    "two - point correlators have been studied in great detail in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory . due to simple kinematics ( only one external momentum )",
    "even multi - loop calculations can be performed .",
    "the results for all physically interesting diagonal and non - diagonal correlators and including _ full _ quark mass dependence are available up to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ at four - loop order the two - point correlators can be considered in two limits . in the high energy limit",
    "massless propagators need to be calculated and in the low energy limit vacuum diagrams ( tadpole integrals without dependence on the external momentum ) arise .",
    "the evaluation of these massive tadpoles in three - loop approximation has been pioneered in ref .",
    "@xcite and automated in ref .",
    "+ similar to the three - loop case , the analytical evaluation of four - loop tadpole integrals is based on the traditional integration - by - parts ( ibp ) method .",
    "in contrast to the three - loop case the manual construction of algorithms to reduce arbitrary diagrams to a small set of master integrals is replaced by laporta s algorithm @xcite . in this context",
    "the ibp identities are generated with numerical values for the powers of the propagators and the irreducible scalar products . in the next step ,",
    "the resulting system of linear equations is then solved in the next step by expressing systematically complicated integrals in terms of simpler ones .",
    "the resulting solutions are then substituted into all the other equations . + this reduction has been implemented in an automated @xcite based program in which partially ideas described in ref . @xcite",
    "have been implemented .",
    "the rational functions in the space - time dimension @xmath1 , which arise in this procedure , are simplified with the program @xcite .",
    "the automated exploitation of _ all _ symmetries of the diagrams by reshuffling the powers of the propagators of a given topology in a unique way strongly reduces the number of equations which need to be solved .    in general",
    ", the tadpole diagrams encountered during our calculation contain both massive and massless lines .",
    "in contrast , the computation of the four - loop @xmath2-functions can be reduced to the evaluation of four - loop tadpoles composed of completely massive propagators .",
    "these special cases have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ vacpol ]",
    "we discuss the calculation of the lowest expansion coefficient of the vacuum polarization function and present the results at four - loop order using methods as described above . in section [ decoupling ]",

    "the first and higher derivatives are important for a precise determination of the charm- and bottom - quark mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but also the lowest expansion coefficient @xmath22 has an interesting physical meaning : it relates the coupling of electromagnetic interaction in different renormalization schemes . in the case of",
    "qed - on - shell - renormalization the residue of the photon propagator is one and the electrical charge @xmath23 coincides with the classical limit .",
    "if one performs renormalization in the @xmath24-scheme one obtains a relation between the coupling constant of the electromagnetic interaction @xmath25 in qed - on - shell - renormalization and the coupling constant @xmath26 in the @xmath24-scheme : @xmath27 for massive quarks , interacting through gluons , @xmath28 has been evaluated in ref .",

    "the masses of the known quark species differ vastly in their magnitude .",
    "often the mass of a heavy quark @xmath51 is much larger than the characteristic momentum scale @xmath52 of the reaction under consideration .",
    "in such a two interrelated problems appear when using an ms - like renormalization scheme .",
    "+ first , two large but quite different mass scales , @xmath52 and @xmath7 , lead to two different types of potentially dangerously large logarithms of @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the standard trick of a proper choice of the renormalization scale @xmath55 is no longer applicable ; + second , according to the appelquist - carazzone theorem @xcite the effects due to heavy particles eventually should in general ` decouple ' from low - energy physics .",
    "however , a peculiarity of mass - independent renormalization schemes is that the decoupling theorem does not hold in its naive form for theories renormalized in such schemes .",
    "the effective qcd action that appears will not be not canonically normalized .",
    "large mass logarithms appear , when one calculates a physical observable .",
