    "for the investigation of the propagation of light in nanosized stuctures , near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) is a powerful and unique technique as it allows for measurements with a high spatial , energy , and momentum resolution . its ability to tap light out of light - confining structures such as integrated optical waveguides @xcite and cavities",
    ", @xcite makes nsom an invaluable and popular tool in nanophotonics .",
    "@xcite one very important class of such nanophotonic structures consists of photonic - crystal waveguides , which are two - dimensional photonic - crystal slabs with a line defect wherein the light is guided .",
    "their importance is found in their unique properties such as their dispersion relation , slow - light propagation , strong confinement of light and thus enhanced light - matter interaction .",
    "@xcite with nsom , one has the tool to determine the dispersion relation in these waveguides and thus the bandstructure , spatially map optical pulses , observe slow - light propagation and phenomena such as disorder - induced formation of anderson localized modes near the band edge , @xcite which otherwise would not be accessible .    here ,",
    "we present our results on measuring the bandstructure of a photonic - crystal waveguide .",
    "we show that our measurements reveal additional bands which are not accounted for in eigenmode solvers .",
    "we analyze these new modes by controlling the incident light intensity in power - scaling measurements .",
    "their nonlinear scaling behavior is different from the linear response of the known bands .",
    "we explain in detail the origin of these nonlinear bands as a consequence of mode coupling caused by thermal perturbation of the standing waves formed in a finite - size gaas photonic - crystal waveguide .",
    "we demonstrate that these new bands are in fact not modes belonging to the photonic - crystal waveguide but a measurement artefact caused by the presence of the nsom tip .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1](a ) shows the experimental setup .",
    "it is an extended version of the setup described in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate on the implemented improvements . a tunable continuous - wave laser ( toptica dlpro 940 ) with a wavelength range between @xmath0 and a linewidth of @xmath1",
    "is used . in order to extract both amplitude as well as phase out of the nsom , a heterodyne interferometric detection technique is used .",

    "i.e. _ , the induced photocurrent , measured as a voltage drop behind a fixed resistor , is measured against a calibrated power meter on the signal input , resulting in a one - to - one mapping of voltage to input power . using this arrangement",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath7 to @xmath8 , throughout the entire wavelength range of the laser . after this calibration , the signal input light",
    "is coupled to the cleaved end facet of a gaas photonic - crystal waveguide by means of a microscope objective ( @xmath9 ) and propagates there along the positive @xmath10-direction .",
    "the polarization of the incident light is kept thereby at approximately @xmath11 with respect to the normal of the waveguide allowing us to excite both te- and tm - like modes simultaneously .",
    "the field pattern is collected @xmath12 away from the coupling facet  to avoid direct light scattering into the collection part  using an al - coated fiber tip with an aperture of @xmath13 ( fig.[fig : fig1](b ) shows a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of such a tip ) .",
    "the tip is thereby kept at a fixed distance of @xmath14 above the sample surface using shear - force feedback control .",
    "the used height is a trade off between picking up enough evanescent light and disturbing the light field by the tip s presence .",
    "the picked - up light is heterodyned with the local oscillator and detected on a si photodiode ( @xmath15 ) allowing to accurately measure amplitude and phase with subwavelength spatial resolution .",
    "the parameters of the gaas photonic - crystal slab waveguide , which are also used in the calculations , are extracted from sem images , such as the one shown in fig.[fig : fig1](c ) and are : pitch size of the triangular lattice @xmath16 , normalized hole radius @xmath17 , and slab thickness @xmath18 .",

    "strikingly , our measurements demonstrate additional bands that are not predicted in the eigenmode solvers . to be certain that the bands calculated by the mpb eigenmode solver are predicted correctly , we varied several parameters , such as the system size , the unit cell as well as the resolution in the calculations .",

    "moreover , from the slope in the bandstructure , as derived from fig.[fig : fig3 ] , one can derive the group index and energy velocity , thus knowing if it is a forward ( f ) or backward ( b ) propagation , which is marked in subscript .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 ( green dashed line in fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) and therefore to the new band n@xmath37 .",
    "we performed power - dependent measurements to study the origin of these new bands . in that respect we took nsom images as shown in fig.[fig : fig2](a ) in a series of power levels ranging from @xmath42 , repeating each measurement 5 times for better statistics . from each nsom image",
    "we calculate the sft ( fig.[fig : fig2](b ) ) and sum up the signal along the @xmath22-direction .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4](a ) shows the resulting fourier signal intensity vs. @xmath43 for two input powers of p@xmath44 ( red ) and p@xmath45 ( green ) , respectively .",
    "the periodic light patterns picked - up by nsom are thereby clearly visible as peaks above the background signal .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the overall intensity of the spectrum changes as a result of the change in power .    to analyze these signals",
    "further we plot the intensity of the k component ( after background subtraction ) as a function of the incident power as is shown exemplarily for the p@xmath36 and n@xmath37 in fig.[fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "surprisingly , the two bands show a different scaling behavior with the incident power . for the predicted mode p@xmath36 a linear dependence of the intensity",
    "is observed as expected .",
    "the new band n@xmath37 on the other hand shows a highly nonlinear behavior . here",
    ", the power law appears to be cubic at powers @xmath46 , and quadratic at intermediate powers . in",
    "the following we explain the observed nonlinear behavior of these new bands appearing in the measurement .",
    "to understand the experimental findings and why the eigenmode calculations can not predict the measured bands , we first look at the difference between calculations and experiment . in contrast to the mpb calculations , which assume an infinite sample length and linear material response , our experiment consist of a finite photonic crystal waveguide .",
    "moreover , gaas is known for its highly nonlinear material response .",
    "@xcite therefore , the eigenmodes of the waveguide as calculated by mpb can only be a starting point for the explanation of the real situation , since it can not account for any coupling between modes .    in the following",
    "we will show that this measurement - induced coupling mechanism leads to virtual mode coupling and is essential for the observation of new bands in our experiment .",
    "we restrict our analysis , without loss of generality , thereby to the effects caused by the brightest eigenmode c. the same effects will also be present in other ( weaker ) eigenmodes . furthermore , we can omit the bloch periodicity in the analysis of the electric field because it does not affect the appearance of the observed new bands .    in the finite structure , reflections from the end facets of the waveguide will lead to a formation of a standing - wave pattern due to forward ( @xmath47 ) and backward ( @xmath48 ) propagating modes , as is schematically depicted in fig.[fig : fig5](a ) . the complete electric field associated with the forward propagating bright eigenmode c at position @xmath49 and frequency @xmath50",
    "is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the field amplitude .",
    "the backward propagating mode is then given by @xmath53 . the total intensity @xmath54 inside the waveguide then becomes    ( color online ) ( a ) schematic representation of a standing - wave intensity pattern formed by counter - propagating waves in a finite photonic - crystal waveguide . the signal is then picked - up with the nsom tip .",
    "( b ) schematic representation of the position - dependent total intensity inside the photonic - crystal waveguide .",
    "the intensity drop during forward and backward propagation is caused by light scattering and absorption of light due to the presence of the tip .",
    "( c ) intensity of the measured fourier signal ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[fig : fig4](b ) ) , as a function of spatial frequency @xmath43 at an incident power of p@xmath44 .",

    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 corresponds to the non - sinusoidal background intensity .",
    "assuming an intensity dependence for the refractive index and inserting eq.[eqn : eq3 ] as expression for the intensity , the refractive index @xmath58 can then be written as :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the linear refractive index of gaas and @xmath61 is the corresponding nonlinear refractive index at the incident optical frequency @xmath50 and intensity @xmath54 .",
    "we need one more ingredient to explain the appearance of the new bands , namely the perturbative nature of nsom measurements .",
    "while scanning across the surface of the waveguide , the tip causes losses predominantly at the maxima of the standing - wave pattern ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[fig : fig5](a ) ) .",
    "this , however , is a loss mechanism for the total power inside the waveguide leading to a variation of the refractive index in the waveguide as a function of the position of the tip . using @xmath54 ( eq.[eqn : eq3 ] ) and leaving out the explicit position and frequency dependence of the amplitudes , the perturbation of the refractive index of a large fraction of the waveguide caused by the moving near - field tip can be described through    @xmath62 \\\\   & = n_{0 } [ 1 + n_{2}i_{\\rm bg } + n_{2 } \\cdot 2| a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm b}^{\\rm c } } a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm f}^{\\rm c}}|\\cos{(2k_c \\frac{x}{a})}]\\\\ & = n_0+\\delta n. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    here",
    "we assume that the field in the waveguide is dominated by band c as justified by fig.[fig : fig3 ] .    as a consequence of this refractive - index change an additional phase @xmath63",
    "is introduced to the propagating light .",
    "the change in phase for any forward propagating mode between the front facet and the nsom tip is thus    @xmath64\\\\ & = \\phi_{\\text{bg } } + k_c r n_{0 } n_{2 } 2| a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm b}^{\\rm c}}a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm f}^{\\rm c}}|\\cos{(2k_c \\frac{x}{a } ) } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 corresponds to the phase term caused by the average temperature rise and hence does not contribute to the new bands .",
    "backward propagating modes experience a similar phase shift .",
    "the measured field can therefore be described as the unperturbed signal with an additional phase . expanding the phase by a taylor series results in the general expression for the field detected by the nsom measurements : @xmath66\\\\ & = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } a e^{-(ik_c \\frac{x}{a}+ \\phi_{\\rm bg})}\\cdot \\frac{(e^{-i2k_c \\frac{x}{a}}+e^{i2k_c \\frac{x}{a}})^n}{2^n n ! } \\\\   & \\cdot[i k_c r n_{0 } n_{2}\\cdot 2 a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm b}^{\\rm c } } a_{{\\rm p}_{\\rm f}^{\\rm c}}]^{n } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is the amplitude of any real mode in the waveguide with wave vector @xmath68 . in particular",
    ", @xmath67 could be @xmath69 .",
    "equation [ eqn : eq8 ] gives the general expression of the field associated with mode c of the intensity - perturbed photonic - crystal waveguide .",
    "its fourier transform will reveal all spatial frequencies present in the measured field data .",
    "the bands will thereby follow the general expression : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "pure mode c corresponds to the term @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eq8 ] and the field associated with this mode is @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "the intensity is thus given by @xmath74 , scaling linearly with the incident intensity as expected for a pure mode .    a new band as observed in the experiment corresponds to @xmath75 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eq8 ] and its field is given by    @xmath76 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    it contains bands corresponding to @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the associated field amplitude for both these bands is proportional to @xmath79 . in the case of n@xmath37 will scale as @xmath80 , therefore the intensity of the new band should scale cubic with the incident intensity . in the same way the new bands e and f can be explained not with mode c but with mode a as perturbed signal field .",
    "in principle , several nonlinear effects can be responsible for the refractive index modification as a consequence of an intensity change .",
    "the kerr effect and a heat - induced index change are the most obvious ones .",
    "our measurements alone do not allow us to dissect the effects , but a thermal origin of the new bands seems the most likely as we will argue below . with a kerr coefficient of the order of @xmath81@xmath82w , @xcite 1mw of power in our waveguide leads to an index of refraction change of less than @xmath83 .",
    "on a length of a mm this causes a @xmath84 rad phase shift .    to understand the effect of heating ,",
    "let us recall the processes leading to a temperature increase inside the waveguide .",
    "the photon energy coupled into the waveguide is between @xmath85 and therefore no direct one - photon absorption of the light is possible ( band gap of gaas : @xmath86 ) . however , due to the confinement of the light inside the waveguide , the intensity can increase such that the probability of two - photon absorption processes becomes non - negligible .",
    "accompanying the photon absorption is a heating up of the sample .",
    "in addition , contaminations or defects at the slab s surface can lead to additional heating .",
    "in fact , we have observed similar waveguides to be destroyed by a runaway thermal degradation at slightly higher excitation powers .",
    "taking the thermal diffusivity and conductivity of gaas into account , @xcite the time it takes the material to thermalize on the length scale of the wavelength @xmath87 is of the order of @xmath88 , which means that the induced local heating pattern ( due to the standing wave ) is completely washed out and therefore homogeneous .",
    "as explained before , however , the total intensity depends on the position of the nsom tip relative to the intensity maxima in the standing light wave .",
    "the alteration of the band intensity correlates to a temperature change as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the absolute temperature of the photonic - crystal waveguide as a function of spatial position @xmath49 of the near - field tip .",
    "the resulting refractive index due to the heating is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 for gaas are 3.255 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "@xcite a rough estimate of the temperature rise given the intrinsic absorption coefficient of gaas and the heat conductivity of the gaas slab yields a temperature rise of about 1k per mw pump power . given @xmath95 ,",
    "this is three orders of magnitude more than the index change caused by the kerr effect .",
    "our model based on the perturbation caused by a near - field tip correctly explains the appearance of the observed new bands .",
    "hence , these bands are not optical modes of the waveguide but a waveguide - specific nsom tip effect not previously observed , where the nsom tip can cause a large phase shift .",
    "there are several circumstances enabling us to observe the new bands in our experiment : 1 ) use of a direct - band gap material with a large thermal coefficient , 2 ) a high thermal isolation provided by the free - standing perforated waveguide samples , and 3 ) phase - sensitive measurement allowing to map and separate individual spatial signals in fourier space .",
    "the observed scaling factor ( _ cf .",
    "_ fig.[fig : fig4](b ) ) matches the one predicted by our model for higher powers .",
    "competing extrinsic as well as intrinsic refractive index perturbing processes can not be ruled out , though .",
    "therefore , even though we successfully explained the observed modal appearance as near - field tip - induced thermal perturbation , we can not exclude the influence of intensity - dependent nonlinear optical effects , since there has already been experimental evidence of a very large nonlinear optical response measured in ingaas photonic - crystal waveguide structures , @xcite yet without clarity on the origin of the effect .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed and explained the existence of new bands in nsom measurements of photonic crystal waveguides not predicted by standard eigenmode calculations .",
    "our experimental results demonstrate an intriguing effect caused by coupling of modes in a finite - sized photonic - crystal waveguide and could be explained as a result of position - dependent tip losses and accompanying temperature changes .",
