    "evidence for this feature has also been reported in galactic clusters @xcite and in non - associated sources @xcite , although the latter claim remains contentious @xcite .",
    "while the statistics are limited , the morphology of the signal may favor an explanation as annihilating dm @xcite .",
    "the presence of an additional photon line at approximately 111 gev @xcite is highly suggestive , if also statistically limited , and would lend more credence to a particle physics explanation @xcite .",
    "the fermi collaboration s own search for photon lines uses slightly different search regions and methodology and sets an upper limit marginally in conflict with the claimed signal  @xcite .",

    "first , there is no evidence for an excess in the continuum photon spectrum , which strongly constrains dm annihilation into the usual sm annihilation channels ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 )  @xcite or indeed into any charged final states . since in most thermal models",
    "dm - photon couplings are generated radiatively from the dm couplings to charged final states  @xcite , the typical line cross section is generically related to the cross - section for annihilation into charged modes @xmath5 by [ eq : continuum ] v _ ~ ( ) ^2 v_x x^. as the fragmentation and decay of the final states @xmath5 give rise to a continuum photon spectrum @xmath6 , if annihilation to charged states is open , the expected line flux is smaller than the continuum flux by several orders of magnitude .",
    "models for the fermi 130 gev line must therefore explain the absence of annihilation into charged ( or hadronic ) modes .",
    "this brings us to the second interesting fact .",
    "the best fit cross - sections for the 130 gev feature @xcite are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the expectation for ( @xmath1-wave ) thermal freezeout .",
    "if annihilation to sm or charged modes is absent or suppressed as the continuum limits suggest , reconciling this inefficient annihilation to photons with the wmap relic density @xmath7  @xcite requires either : ( 1 ) a nonthermal relic abundance  @xcite ; ( 2 ) non - photonic annihilation modes which are suppressed , possibly only post - freezeout , relative to the naive radiative scaling of eq .",

    "our first example is resonant freezeout , where the presence of a resonance in the dm sector spectrum enhances the annihilation cross - section into photons during freezeout .",

    "<S> recent claims of a line in the fermi - lat photon spectrum at 130 gev are suggestive of dark matter annihilation in the galactic center and other dark matter - dominated regions . </S>",
    "<S> if the fermi feature is indeed due to dark matter annihilation , the best - fit line cross - section , together with the lack of any corresponding excess in continuum photons , poses an interesting puzzle for models of thermal dark matter : the line cross - section is too large to be generated radiatively from open standard model annihilation modes , and too small to provide efficient dark matter annihilation in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two mechanisms to solve this puzzle and illustrate each with a simple reference model in which the dominant dark matter annihilation channel is photonic final states . </S>",
    "<S> the first mechanism we employ is resonant annihilation , which enhances the annihilation cross - section during freezeout and allows for a sufficiently large present - day annihilation cross section . </S>",
    "<S> second , we consider cascade annihilation , with a hierarchy between @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave processes . </S>",
    "<S> both mechanisms require mass near - degeneracies and predict states with masses closely related to the dark matter mass ; resonant freezeout in addition requires new charged particles at the tev scale . </S>"
