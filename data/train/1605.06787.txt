    "<S> by combining @xmath0-type @xmath1 and @xmath2-type @xmath3 topological insulators , vertically stacked @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions can be formed , allowing to position the fermi level into the bulk band gap and also tune between @xmath0- and @xmath2-type surface carriers . </S>",
    "<S> here we use low - temperature magnetotransport measurements to probe the surface and bulk transport modes in a range of vertical @xmath4 heterostructures with varying relative thicknesses of the top and bottom layers . with increasing thickness of the @xmath3 layer </S>",
    "<S> we observe a change from @xmath0- to @xmath2-type behavior and a specific regime where the hall signal is immeasurable . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a multichannel conductance model which has the mobility of the topological surface state as the only fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the model correctly anticipates the dependence of the hall and longitudinal components of resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it predicts the compensation of @xmath0- and @xmath2-type contributions at a specific composition , where indeed the resistance is very high and , simultaneously , the hall signal is immeasurable . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , it explains why the alignment of fermi level and dirac point do not coincide with the suppression of bulk conduction . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide crucial experimental and theoretical insights into the relative roles of the surface and bulk in the vertical topological @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions and establish them as viable low-@xmath5 counterparts to alternative bulk - compensated topological insulators .    </S>",
    "<S> topological insulators ( tis ) are bulk insulators with exotic ` topological surface states '  @xcite ( tsss ) which are robust to backscattering from non - magnetic impurities , exhibit spin - momentum locking@xcite and have a dirac - like dispersion@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . these unique characteristics present several opportunities for applications in spintronics , thermoelectricity , and quantum computation due to which tis have received much recent attention . however , a major drawback of ` early generation ' tis such as @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite is that the fermi level @xmath8 intersects the conduction / valence bands , thus giving rise to finite conductivity in the bulk . this non - topological conduction channel conducts in parallel to the tsss and in turn subverts the overall topological nature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to create bona fide tis , the fermi level @xmath8 needs to be tuned within the bulk bandgap , and this has previously been achieved by means of electrical gating  @xcite , doping  @xcite , or , as recently reported , by creating @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions from two different ti films  @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a ` vertical topological @xmath2-@xmath0 junction ' was realised by growing an @xmath0-type @xmath1 layer capped by a layer of @xmath2-type @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that varying the @xmath2-layer thickness serves to tune @xmath8 and this was exploited towards controlling the tss carrier type without the use of an external field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , such bilayer systems are expected to be significantly less disordered than doped materials such as @xmath9 in which @xmath8 can lie within the bulk band gap , but where inhomogeneity of the dopants is a constant problem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , and in sharp contrast to doped tis , the intrinsic @xmath2 and @xmath0 character of the individual layers allows for the spontaneous existence of an @xmath0-type and a @xmath2-type tss on adjacent sides of a single ti slab  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn presents remarkable opportunities towards the observation of novel excitonic interactions between dirac fermions including klein tunneling  @xcite , or exotic quantum states such as the topological exciton condensate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , currently there exists little understanding of the bulk conduction in such topological @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions , primarily because the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to probe them is a surface - sensitive method . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially noteworthy in light of the varying band structure within the ti slab which is a prominent difference from the essentially constant band gap within the bulk of @xmath9-type compounds . </S>",
    "<S> understanding and minimizing the bulk conduction channels in ti @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions is crucial in order to realize their technological potential and also in order to gain access to the exotic physics they can host .    in this letter , we report low - temperature ( low-@xmath10 ) magnetotransport measurements on hall bars lithographically patterned on to @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions similar to those reported in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we measure and analyse the longitudinal and hall components of resistance ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively ) and , as expected , find a change from @xmath0-type to @xmath2-type charge carriers as the thickness of the @xmath2-type layer is increased . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we also encounter a specific ratio of thicknesses in which there is _ no measurable hall signal _ , indicating a near perfect cancellation of @xmath2 and @xmath0 contributions . </S>",
    "<S> unexpectedly , however , this occurs at a thickness ratio _ </S>",
    "<S> different _ to that in which arpes measurements reveal @xmath8 to intersect the dirac point  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe this difference to the uncompensated charges in the bulk which can not be discerned using arpes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we understand the relative roles of the bulk and surface by means of a simple model of the hall coefficient in a multi - channel system . </S>",
    "<S> the model correctly predicts the hall coefficient for the range of @xmath13 heterostructures explored here using only a single fitting parameter , namely the mobility of the tss . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it predicts that the _ effective _ carrier concentration goes to zero precisely where the hall slope is intractable . with further refinement </S>",
    "<S> the model is also able to predict @xmath11 of the heterostructures , thus providing insights into the bulk conduction which , in turn , yields a better understanding of the origin of the much - debated high - field linear mr  @xcite often observed in dirac materials .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4-bilayers ( bst ) were grown on phosphorous doped si substrates using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber . in all the samples , the bottom @xmath1-layer had thickness @xmath14  =  6 nm while the top @xmath3-layers had thicknesses @xmath15 6.6 nm ( bst6 ) , 7.5 nm ( bst7 ) , 15 nm ( bst15 ) , and 25 nm ( bst25 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the samples used for this work stem from the same growth process and have the same materials parameters as samples previously used for arpes measurements ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the layers were patterned into hall bars of width @xmath16 and length @xmath17 using photoresist as a mask for ion milling , and ti / au contact pads were deposited for electrical contact . </S>",
    "<S> low-@xmath10 , low - noise transport measurements were carried out using lock - in techniques in a he-3 cryostat with a base temperature of 280mk and a 10 t superconducting magnet .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the longitudinal magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xmath18 of the various samples considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find that above @xmath19 t the mr in bst6 and bst7 is linear with no obvious indication of the lorentz - force induced @xmath20-dependence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mr in bst15 and bst25 , on the other hand , appears to be neither purely linear or quadratic . </S>",
    "<S> while there is experimental evidence suggesting an association between linear mr and linearly dispersive media  @xcite , as well as a theoretical basis for this association  @xcite , we note that disorder can also render giant linear mr  @xcite by admixing longitudinal and hall voltages .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) we see that @xmath12 is linear in @xmath21 and its slope changes sign from positive ( bst6 ) to negative ( bst15 and bst25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is simply a reflection of different charge carrier types of @xmath1 ( @xmath0-type ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath2-type ) , where electrons ( holes ) dominate transport when @xmath3 is thin ( thick ) . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) shows @xmath12 vs @xmath21 measured in two different hall bar devices of bst7 to be both non - linear and non - monotonic , and clearly offset from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , it appears as though @xmath12 is picking up a large component of @xmath11 despite the hall probes being aligned to each other with lithographic ( @xmath22m - scale ) precision . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , therefore , that bst7 is very close to where @xmath23 precisely changes from positive to negative . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , arpes measurements in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reveal that @xmath8 intersects the dirac point in samples with 15 nm  @xmath24  25 nm , in which parameter regime fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) indicates a net excess of @xmath2-type carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the origin for this complicated behavior is the interplay of bulk and surface transport channels of opposite charge types , and their influence on @xmath11 and @xmath12 is schematically depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we first determine the number of participating tsss and subsequently develop a model to describe the behavior of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in order to estimate the number of tsss </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the ` weak antilocalisation ' ( wal ) characteristics as well as signatures of electron - electron interactions ( eei ) in the transport . </S>",
    "<S> the wal cusp observed at low-@xmath21 for all the devices in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) is indicative of positive quantum corrections to the conductance arising due to the @xmath25-berry phase of the tsss  @xcite and/or the strong spin - orbit coupling in the bulk of the tis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these corrections are well - described by the model of hikami , larkin and nagaoka ( hln )  @xcite from which we obtain the number of 2d wal channels @xmath26 and the phase coherence length @xmath27 as fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> wal measurements and a description of the fitting procedure can be found in the supplemental material  @xcite .     as a function of the temperature t for various @xmath3 layer thicknesses in a double - logarithmic plot . </S>",
    "<S> all curves are proportional to @xmath28 ( dashed line ) but shifted with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath29 as a function of the temperature @xmath10 for various @xmath3 layer thicknesses . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath27 for all samples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath30 , where the exponent @xmath31 is in line with 2d nyquist scattering  @xcite due to electron - electron scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> we also note in this context that @xmath27 is always larger than the sample thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the second fitting parameter @xmath29 is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) and we find values consistent with the existence of only one tss . importantly , and in agreement with the behavior of @xmath12 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows @xmath27 to be non - monotonic in @xmath32 , being smallest for bst7 .    </S>",
    "<S> while wal manifests as positive corrections to the conductivity , eeis serve to suppress it  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for this in the inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) which shows @xmath11 as a function of @xmath10 to crossover from metallic ( @xmath33 ) to insulating ( @xmath34 ) behavior at a characteristic temperature @xmath35 ( indicated by the arrow ; see also figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-(d ) in @xcite ) . figure  [ fig3](a ) shows @xmath35 to be non - monotonic in @xmath32 with the largest observed value for , again , bst7 . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast this behavior to that reported by liu  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in ultrathin @xmath7-layers in which the characteristic temperature decreased monotonically with film thickness due to the decreasing contribution of bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](b ) shows that @xmath36 has a logarithmic dependence on @xmath10 for different @xmath21 which is the expected dependence in 2d in the presence of wal and/or eei . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity corrections due to eei assume the following form  @xcite @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the logarithmic @xmath10 dependence , @xmath0 is the number of 2d channels contributing to eei , and @xmath39 the screening factor . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eei ] we find that @xmath40 saturates by 0.2 t ( see fig .  [ fig3](c ) ) indicating the dephasing of the tss and consequent suppression of wal . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , we obtain @xmath43 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus both the wal and eei characteristics suggest @xmath43 , i.e. , that only one tss is present at all thicknesses . since a tss on the top surface has been confirmed using arpes  @xcite , we conclude that the tss on the bottom layer must be disrupted .     as a function of @xmath3 thickness . </S>",

    "<S> ( d ) @xmath29 obtained from the field dependence of @xmath40 in ( c ) . ]    having established that the hall slope changes in the vicinity of @xmath46 nm and having ascertained that only one tss contributes to the transport , we are now in a position to explain the complex interplay of bulk and tss . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the expression for the hall coefficient in a multi - channel system @xcite :    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is the effective carrier concentration , @xmath49 @xmath50 for electrons and @xmath51 for holes ( e itself is negative ) , @xmath52 is the carrier concentration and @xmath53 is the mobility of the @xmath54th channel and @xmath55 corresponding to the bottom ( @xmath0-type ) @xmath1 layer , the top ( @xmath2-type ) @xmath3 layer , and the tss , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the following literature values for the bulk layers are used : @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath3  @xcite . in order to meaningfully compare @xmath60 and @xmath61 to the tss carrier concentration , </S>",
    "<S> we convert them to effective areal densities as @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the carrier concentration of the tss @xmath64 where the binding energy @xmath65 is the difference between @xmath66 and dirac point ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 can be retrieved from arpes measurements in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xmath67 can be shown to scale as @xmath68 ( see eq .  5 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> substituting the above in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hallmc ] we obtain @xmath23 as a function of the varying @xmath32 layer :    @xmath69    the ` - ' sign is for negative ( @xmath70 nm ) and the ` + ' sign for positive charge carriers ( @xmath71 nm ) in the tss . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of    @xmath23 calculated from eq .  [ hall ] </S>",
    "<S> is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ( straight red line ) , together with the measured values ( black squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that with just a single fitting parameter @xmath72 , the model captures the broad physics namely that @xmath23 changes sign at around @xmath73 nm and there is reasonable quantitative agreement overall . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly consistent with the observation of ` no ' hall slope in bst7 .    using the individual @xmath53 and @xmath52 of all three channels , we are now able to construct the net resistance @xmath74 using @xmath75 ( fig .  [ fig4](c ) ) , as well as differentiate between the bulk and surface contributions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that while there is reasonable agreement between the measured and predicted @xmath11 at large @xmath32 , the model is not adequate for low @xmath32 where the model significantly underestimates @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> intuitively it can be argued that the literature values of @xmath22 for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 layers will overestimate the thin film mobility . </S>",
    "<S> this is further exacerbated by the fact that a depletion zone must exist at the @xmath2-@xmath0 interface which will induce a further reduction in @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on these physical arguments and noting that they should affect the thinner layers more , we introduce an _ ad hoc _ thickness - dependent reduction of the mobility of both bulk layers with all other parameters unchanged and @xmath72 still the only fitting parameter . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](b ) shows the result of a fit in which @xmath76 and @xmath77 are reduced to 20% of their bulk value in bst6 and bst7 , and to 95% of their bulk value bst15 and bst25 . </S>",
    "<S> not only do we obtain excellent agreement with the @xmath23 data , the model is also able to accurately predict @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained value of @xmath78@xmath79 is well within the range of previous studies in ultra - thin tis where the tsss dominate transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the quality of the fit relies on the important physical insight that the bulk contribution is drastically reduced in thin films , and not simply due to the increased surface - to - volume ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to the question of the linear magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the linearity appears when the bulk conductivity is decreased and thus most pronounced in bst6 and bst7 ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) and [ fig4](f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> if , indeed , the bulk mobility is sharply reduced in the thinner films , then it can be argued that the observed linear magnetoresistance is a disorder effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , for bst6 and bst7 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) the magnitude of the mr is anti - correlated to the film thickness , i.e. , bst6 which should have the higher degree of bulk disorder , has a lower mr than bst7 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the capability of our method to disentangle the relative roles of the bulk and surface in tis , can be crucial towards the understanding of linear mr .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have reported low-@xmath10 magnetotransport measurements on vertical topological @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions and understood the data within a three - channel model for the hall resistance . </S>",
    "<S> this provides useful insights into the complex interplay of bulk states and tss in the multilayered ti structures , explains the sign change of @xmath23 with varying @xmath32 , and delivers values for the mobility of the tss of 180@xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> our work paves the way for the study of other complex ti heterostructures  @xcite , where bulk states and tsss of different carrier types coexist . </S>",
    "<S> low-@xmath10 transport measurements are a powerful tool for the examination of ti multilayers , delivering not only information about topological transport , but also about electron - electron interactions . in future </S>",
    "<S> , our method can be applied to improved topological @xmath2-@xmath0 junctions in which the top and bottom tss are present and can form novel dirac fermion excitonic states .    </S>",
