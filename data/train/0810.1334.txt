    "the superconducting josephson junction qubit is a leading candidate in the design of a quantum computer , with several experiments demonstrating single qubit preparation , manipulation , and measurement , @xcite as well as the coupling of qubits .",

    "recent experiments @xcite indicate that a dominant source of decoherence is two level systems ( tls ) that are fluctuating in the insulating barrier of the tunnel junction as well as in the dielectric material used to fabricate the circuit , e.g. , the substrate .",
    "the two level fluctuators that have electric dipole moments can induce image charges in the nearby superconductor and hence produce charge noise @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite    previous theories of charge noise@xcite have neglected the important issue of the saturation of the two level systems by electric fields used to manipulate the qubits .",
    "dielectric ( ultrasonic ) experiments on insulating glasses at low temperatures have found that when the electric ( acoustic ) field intensity @xmath2 used to make the measurements exceeds the critical intensity @xmath4 , the dielectric ( ultrasonic ) power absorption by the tls is saturated , and the attenuation decreases as the field intensity increases .",
    "@xcite ( if @xmath9 denotes the electric field , then we define the intensity @xmath10 . )",
    "previous theories of charge noise in josephson junctions assumed that the tls were not saturated , i.e. , that @xmath11 .",
    "this seems sensible since charge noise experiments @xcite have been done in the limit where the qubit absorbed only one photon .",

    "we can do a similar estimate to show that a single photon would even more strongly saturate resonant tls in the insulating barrier of the tunnel junction .",
    "we use the same numbers as before but with @xmath33 ff and the thickness of the junction @xmath34 nm to obtain @xmath35 v , and @xmath36 .    however , there are only a few tls in the oxide barrier of a small tunnel junction as the following estimate shows . for a parallel plate capacitor with @xmath34 nm and @xmath37m@xmath17 ,",

    "the presence of @xmath7 noise implies many more than 2 fluctuators .",
    "it is likely that these additional fluctuators are in the substrate .",

    "we make this division because we can find the time dependence of the density matrix ( in the schroedinger representation ) due to the driving field by solving the bloch - redfield equations .",
    "since it is not clear how to include the random fluctuations of the two level systems in the hamiltonian and hence , in the bloch - redfield equations , we will treat the random fluctuations separately .",

    "the benefit of this approach is that it is valid in both equilibrium as well as steady state non - equilibrium situations . from the polarization noise spectral density ,",
    "we can obtain the charge noise @xmath8 .",
    "we then average over the distribution of independent tls .",
    "unlike previous theoretical efforts,@xcite we use the standard tls density of states that is a constant independent of energy .    at low frequencies ( @xmath63 )",
    "the system is in equilibrium , and we find @xmath7 charge noise that is proportional to the temperature and to the dielectric loss tangent @xmath64 that has a well known contribution from the electric dipole moments of tls.@xcite in addition the low frequency charge noise has negligible dependence on the electric field intensity ratio @xmath5 .    at high frequencies ( @xmath65 )",
    "we find that the charge noise is white noise independent of frequency .",
    "it has a very weak dependence on the ratio @xmath60 and the driving frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we also find that the amplitude of the high frequency white charge noise decreases gradually as the temperature increases .",
    "the fact that the charge noise spectrum depends very weakly on the ratio @xmath60 indicates that the saturation of two level systems does not affect charge noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present our model of a tls in an external driving field . in section [ fdt ] ,",
