    "the schrdinger equation for a combined system of electrons and nuclei enables us to predict most of the chemistry and molecular physics that surrounds us , including biophysical processes of great complexity .",
    "unfortunately , this task is not possible in general , and approximations need to be made ; one of the most important and successful being the classical approximation for a number of the particles .",
    "mixed quantum - classical dynamical ( mqcd ) models are therefore necessary and widely used .",
    "we could say that , typically , the technique used to build mqcd models is a partial ` deconstruction ' of the quantum mechanics ( qm ) of the total system ( electrons and nuclei ) followed by a ` reconstruction ' that tries to recover the essential properties of the total schrdinger equation lost in the deconstruction process .",
    "it is unrealistic to expect the reconstructed theory has the same predictive power as the schrdinger equation , so the reconstructed theory will apply with enough accuracy only to a subset of systems and questions ; a subset whose boundaries are difficult to predict a priori . in the literature , there are at least two common levels of deconstruction , one further away from the total schrdinger equation for electrons and nuclei , called born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics ( bomd ) , where electrons are assumed to remain in the ground state for all times , and another one closer to it , called ehrenfest dynamics ( ed ) , where nuclei are still classical ( as in bomd ) but the electrons are allowed to populate excited states ( some misleading notation used in the literature on ed is clarified in section 2 of ref . ) .    in j. c. tully s surface hopping methods,@xcite for example , the deconstruction goes to bomd and the reconstruction proceeds by allowing the system to perform certain specially designed stochastic jumps between adiabatic states .    in the decay of mixing formalism by d. g. truhlar and",
    "coworkers,@xcite the deconstruction stops at the ed and the reconstruction is developed by adding decoherence to it .",
    "this has been shown to be more accurate than surface hopping methods for non - born - oppenheimer collisions .    when considered for a single system ,",
    "ed is a fully coherent semiclassical method , and hence purity preserving . as decoherence must be a property of any realistic model,@xcite many mqcd models",
    "have been reconstructed in order to produce electronic decoherence .",
    "see , for example , refs .  , that range from one of the most classic in this matter @xcite to one of the most recent.@xcite . in ref .",
    ", we can find a recent study of decoherence in the context of surface hopping and an important conclusion : averaging over a swarm of initial conditions , decoherence can be measured ; but the method can not capture all the observed effects ( for example , the averaging is not enough to capture the physics of wave packet bifurcations on multiple surfaces ) . in the case of decay of mixing formalisms , where the trajectories in the swarm are considered as independent , decoherence phenomena are incorporated algorithmically ( see eq .",
    "18 of ref .  ) .",
    "in this paper we study the problem from a different perspective .",
    "first of all , we consider a complete statistical description of ed , which was introduced in ref .   in full detail .",
    "based on that construction , we develop a description of quantum statistical mechanics which can be adapted to mixed quantum - classical systems in a straightforward but rigorous manner .",
    "this allows us to consider , in a simple way , the evolution of the purity of the quantum subsystem of our ehrenfest model .",
    "we prove thus that , while a single ehrenfest system evolves preserving the purity of the quantum state , the behavior changes dramatically when a statistical distribution is considered and , in general , it introduces a change in the purity of the quantum system along the trajectory .",
    "therefore , we can claim that our general statistical ed formalism is purity non - preserving ; a property which always accompanies decoherence phenomena ( see for example sec .  3.5 in ref .  ) .",
    "this work opens thus a new line of research in the direction of taking into account decoherence phenomena in ed .",
    "of course , those ingredients still missing for a proper description of decoherence in our ehrenfest statistical formalism could be later added in a reconstruction process similar to the ones mentioned before , but this time starting from a , presumably better , purity non - preserving dynamics    a full study of the decoherence process is a very complex task which includes deep quantum theoretic concepts as the measurement problem and the interpretations of qm ( see , for example , refs .   for a general discussion , and ref .   for the analysis of the decoherence phenomenon on molecular systems ) . in this paper",
    "we voluntarily restrict ourselves to a simple property reflecting the decoherence phenomenon .",
    "namely , the change in the ` degree of mixture ' of the quantum state in a mqcd model , as quantified by the purity @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned , we shall see in sections [ sec : purity - non - pres ] and [ sec : ejemplo ] that ed provides a framework where this change takes place .",
    "the actual relation with the electronic decoherence in molecular systems requires a much more involved analysis which will be developed in the future .    besides the incomplete description of decoherence , usual approaches to ed",
    "have also been often criticized on the basis that it does not yield the boltzmann equilibrium distribution for the electrons exactly.@xcite the lack of this property , which we agree is desirable , is however not enough to rule out ed for all applications , as we recently argued .",
    "@xcite    the structure of the paper is as follows : sections from  [ sec : notion - decoherence ] to  [ sec : purity - non - pres ] introduce the mathematical formalism and the relevant definitions , which are then put into practice in the numerical example in sec .",
    "[ sec : ejemplo ] .",
    "[ sec : notion - decoherence ] reviews the notion of purity in qm and proves the well known fact that ed preserves the purity of the quantum subsystem when we consider the evolution of a single trajectory from perfectly determined initial conditions .",
    "[ sec : geom - quant - stat ] presents a very brief summary of the formulation of geometric qm ( see for a more careful presentation ) and it provides an analogous formulation of a quantum statistical system within the same framework .",
    "in particular , a suitable formulation of the purity of a quantum system is introduced .",
    "[ sec : purity - non - pres ] presents the main contribution of the paper : first , we review the geometrical formulation of ed and its associated statistical equilibrium introduced in . then , we adapt the tools introduced in the previous section in order to be able to study the evolution of the purity of the quantum subsystem in a suitable way , and to show that ed is purity non - preserving . the use of the geometrical formalism , as we will see in what follows , allows to perform a very direct analysis of the problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ejemplo ] , we numerically illustrate the change in purity produced by ed using a very simple but extremely useful example : a statistical system defined by a pure quantum state and an ensemble of initial conditions of the classical subsystem .",
    "such a system has been used in the literature as a natural framework for molecular dynamics ( see for example refs .  ) .",
    "we use it as the simplest nontrivial ehrenfest statistical system where we can show how the purity of the quantum part of the system evolves in time depending on the coupling between the classical and quantum systems , the initial momentum of the classical particles , the dimension of the quantum state space and the number of trajectories considered in the initial conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl - future - work ] we present our conclusions and our plans for future works .",
    "given a hilbert space @xmath3 , we shall call * density states * to the elements @xmath4 obtained as convex combinations of rank - one projectors @xmath5 , each element satisfying @xmath6 with a probability vector , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the expression of a general density state is then @xmath11 the evaluation of some observable @xmath12 on this state is given by @xmath13    the state of the quantum system is said to be * pure * if the density matrix which represents it is a rank - one projector , i.e. , if the convex combination above contains only one term .",
    "if this property does not hold , the system is said to be in a * mixed * state , since , from the physical point of view , there is a statistical mixture of the different pure states represented by the density matrices @xmath14 above .",
    "being a hermitian operator , the matrix @xmath4 can be diagonalized .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath15 satisfy @xmath16 if the state is pure , there is one eigenvalue equal to one , the rest being zero . obviously , the rank of @xmath4 as a projector on the hilbert space @xmath3 coincides with the number of nonvanishing eigenvalues .",
    "it is an immediate property that a state @xmath4 is pure if and only if @xmath17 the proof requires only eq .  .",
    "the description of a quantum system in terms of a density matrix uses von neumann s equation to introduce the dynamics .",
    "then we know that , given the hamiltonian operator @xmath18 , the evolution of the state @xmath4 is given by @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] is the usual commutator of operators .    using a simple proof which is formally identical to the one that we shall present in the next section , one can easily show that this dynamics is purity - preserving , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the ehrenfest equations @xcite for a system composed of a set of @xmath22 classical particles ( typically nuclei ; described by the phase space variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) and a set of @xmath25 quantum particles ( typically electrons ; described by a wavefunction @xmath26 , defined on the space parameterized by @xmath27 ) are : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and the electronic hamiltonian operator @xmath30 is related to the molecular one @xmath18 and it is defined as follows : @xmath31 where all sums must be understood as running over the whole natural set for each index , @xmath32 is the mass of the @xmath33-th nucleus in units of the electron mass , and @xmath34 is the charge of the @xmath33-th nucleus in units of ( minus ) the electron charge .    at first sight ,",
    "given the similarity between eq .",
    "and the schrdinger equation for an isolated full - quantum system , one might erroneously think that the ehrenfest evolution for the quantum part of the system is unitary .",
    "@xcite if this was correct , then it would be trivial to prove that ed is purity preserving , but this is not the case .",
    "as is well known , for a one to one transformation , we can define unitarity as the property of preserving the scalar product , i.e. , given two arbitrary vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we say that @xmath37 is unitary if @xmath38 .",
    "one can easily see that any reversible transformation @xmath37 that enjoys this property is necessarily linear : @xmath39 as @xmath37 is reversible , @xmath40 is an arbitrary vector , and therefore , we must have , @xmath41 but , although the quantum part of the the equations of motion in resembles a typical schrdinger equation , the coupling with the classical part makes the evolution of the quantum system nonlinear . consequently , it can not be a unitary transformation as defined above .    despite this non - unitarity",
    ", it is very simple to prove that , if we consider the evolution of a single trajectory @xmath42 of an ehrenfest system , the quantum part is always in a pure state :    let @xmath42 be the initial state of an ehrenfest system subject to the dynamics given by eqs .",
    ". then , the quantum part of the system is always in a pure state    we consider the density matrix @xmath43 corresponding to the quantum part of the ehrenfest system .",
    "the evolution of @xmath44 is given by eq .",

    "if @xmath48 at @xmath49 , it will remain so .",
    "the main goal of the rest of the paper is to prove that , when we consider the case of a statistical ensemble of ehrenfest trajectories , this is no longer the case : the evolution of an ensemble whose quantum part is a pure state at @xmath49 will become an ensemble in which the quantum part is mixed as long as the initial conditions for the nuclei are not perfectly determined .",
    "thus , in such a case , the ed produces a purity change , a necessary condition for decoherence .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide a very brief summary of the mathematical formalism more thoroughly introduced in and references therein .",
    "classical mechanics can be formulated in several mathematical frameworks each corresponding to a different level of abstraction : newton s equations , the hamiltonian formalism , the poisson brackets , etc .",
    "perhaps its more abstract and general formulation is geometrical , in terms of poisson manifolds .",
    "similarly , qm can also be formulated in different ways , some of which resemble its classical counterpart ( see ref .   for a classical reference in the context of molecular systems , ref .   for a more recent one , and refs .   for more mathematical approaches ) .",
    "for example , the observables ( self - adjoint linear operators ) are endowed with a poisson algebra structure ( based on the commutators ) almost equal to the one that characterizes the dynamical variables in classical mechanics . moreover",
    ", schrdinger equation can be recast into hamilton s equations form by transforming the complex hilbert space into a real one of double dimension .",
    "the observables are also transformed into dynamical functions in this new phase space , in analogy to the classical one .",
    "finally , a poisson bracket formulation has also been established for qm , which permits to classify both the classical and the quantum dynamics under the same heading .",
    "this variety of formulations does not emerge from academic caprice ; the succesive abstractions simplify further developments of the theory , such as the step from microscopic dynamics to statistical dynamics : the derivation of liouville s equation ( or von neumann s equation in the quantum case ) , at the heart of statistical dynamics , is based on the properties of the poisson algebra.@xcite    consider a basis @xmath50 for the hilbert space @xmath51 .",
    "each state @xmath52 can be written in that basis with complex components ( or coordinates , in more differential geometric terms ) @xmath53 : @xmath54    now , we can just take the original vector space inherent to the hilbert space , and turn it into a real vector space ( denoted as @xmath55 ) , by splitting each coordinate into its real and imaginary parts : @xmath56 we will use real coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath58 , to represent the points of @xmath3 when thought of as real vector space elements . from this point of view , the similarities between the quantum dynamics and the classical one will be more evident .",
    "it is important to notice , though , that despite the formal similarities these coordinates @xmath57 do not represent physical positions and momenta of any actual system .",
    "they simply correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the complex coordinates used for the hilbert space vectors in a given basis .",
    "the scalar product of the hilbert space is encoded in three tensors defined on the real vector space @xmath55 .",
    "the interested reader is addressed to ref .   for the details .",
    "we just highlight here that two of these tensors correspond to a metric tensor @xmath59 and a symplectic one @xmath60 which allow us to write the expression of the schrdinger equation as a hamilton equation , in a form which is completely analogous to the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics .",
    "it is precisely this similarity the key ingredient to successfully combine classical and quantum mechanics in a well - defined framework to describe the ehrenfest equations  as a hamiltonian system , as we will summarize later and it can also be seen in ref .  .",
    "in this formalism , instead of considering the observables as linear operators ( plus the usual requirements , self - adjointness , boundedness , etc . ) on the hilbert space @xmath3 , we shall represent them as functions defined on the real space @xmath55 .",
    "the reason for that is to resemble , as much as possible , the classical mechanical approach .",
    "but we can not forget the linearity of the operators , and thus the functions must be chosen in a very particular way .",
    "the usual choice is inspired in ehrenfest s description of quantum mechanical systems and defines , associated to any operator @xmath12 on @xmath3 , a function of the form : @xmath61    the operations which are defined on the set of operators can also be translated into this new language .",
    "thus , the associative product of operators ( the matrix product when considered in a finite dimensional hilbert space ) , the commutator ( which encodes the dynamics ) and the anticommutator can be written in terms of the functions of the type defined in eq .  . as an example , we can write the case of the commutator , which will be used later : given two operators @xmath12 and @xmath62 , with the corresponding functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the function associated to the commutator @xmath65=i(ab - ba)$ ] ( the imaginary unit is used to preserve hermiticity ) is written as @xmath66}=\\ { f_a , f_b\\}=\\frac 12 \\sum_k \\left ( \\frac { \\partial f_a}{\\partial        q^k}\\frac{\\partial f_b}{\\partial p_k}- \\frac { \\partial f_a}{\\partial        p_k}\\frac{\\partial f_b}{\\partial q^k } \\right ) .\\ ] ] thus , from the formal point of view , the operation is completely analogous to the poisson bracket used in classical mechanics .",
    "another important property in the set of operators of qm is the corresponding spectral theory . in any quantum system",
    ", it is of the utmost importance to be able to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "we can summarize these properties in the following result : if @xmath67 is the function associated to the observable @xmath12 , then , as a consequence of ritz s theorem , @xcite    * the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath12 coincide with the critical points of the function @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 * the eigenvalue of @xmath12 at the eigenvector @xmath26 is the value that the function @xmath67 takes at the critical point @xmath26 .    as usual",
    ", the dynamics can be implemented in essentially two different forms ( but always in a way which is compatible with the geometric structures introduced so far ) : the so - called schrdinger and heisenberg pictures @xcite . in the heisenberg picture , which is the one we will use in what follows ,",
    "the dynamics is introduced by translating the well - known heisenberg equation into the language of functions : @xmath69 being @xmath70 the function associated to the hamiltonian operator and @xmath12 any observable .        a classical result in qm states that , given a quantum system , the average value of any observable @xmath12 can always be computed as the trace of the observable and some density state @xmath4 , as defined in section [ sec : noti - purity - quant ] : @xmath71 this result is known as gleason theorem ( see ref . for details ) .    instead of using the density matrix @xmath4",
    ", we can use an alternative approach which is formally closer to the description of classical statistical systems and is used , for instance , in ref .  .",
    "consider a probability distribution @xmath72 on @xmath55 and a volume element @xmath73 , satisfying the properties :    * @xmath74 * expected values can be computed as @xmath75 for all @xmath63 of the form ; @xmath12 being a hermitian operator .",
    "notice that we have chosen to integrate over all the states in @xmath55 and divide by the norm of the state , as it is done in the final section of ref .  .",
    "this is equivalent to integrate over the states of norm one as it was also done in the first sections of ref .  .    the canonical symplectic form of @xmath55 described in ref",
    "provides a natural candidate for the volume form since it is also preserved by the quantum evolution ( see ref .   for the technical details ) .",
    "some simple examples for the distribution @xmath72 can also be provided :    for the case of the pure state @xmath76 , we can use @xmath77 to satisfy the above two equalities .",
    "analogously , a mixed state @xmath78 ( where @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) can be represented by @xmath81 in particular , it is straighforward to prove that , in this case , @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    the definition of the function @xmath72 contains a number of ambiguities which are explained in detail in ref .  .",
    "essentially , we can add to any @xmath72 a term which integrates to zero and has vanishing second - order momenta .",
    "due to the structure of the observable functions @xmath63 , this modification will not change any average value computed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp_q_general ] ) , nor will it change the normalization condition for @xmath72",
    ". this defines an equivalence class of distributions that produce the same average values , and ( through the relationship between distributions and density matrices ) gleason theorem implies that there is always a distribution in the class in which the fact that we are dealing with a convex combination of rank-1 projectors is visible .",
    "this is what we used in the example above .    in order to advance in the formulation and illustrate these facts",
    "more precisely , we can consider , for every @xmath85 , the following function : @xmath86    now , it is easy to see that the following ( averaged , now @xmath26-independent ) function @xmath87 is the phase - space function associated to a density operator @xmath4 defined by @xmath88 i.e. , @xmath89    with these definitions , we can now prove the following result :    [ sec : density ] let us consider a quantum system in a state described by a probability distribution @xmath72 . then , the equivalence class of distributions that produce the same expected values as @xmath72 contains as an element : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the set of critical points of @xmath92 ( as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) and  ( [ eq:11bis ] ) ) and @xmath93    it is immediate if we realize that @xmath94    indeed , the operator @xmath4 appearing in this expression and defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) can be shown to be a density matrix ( i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ) , and gleason s theorem guarantees it is unique .",
    "we also know that , if we use the spectral decomposition of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath98 , with @xmath83 , being @xmath99 and @xmath100 its eigenvectors and eigenvalues , respectively , we also have that @xmath101 as we set out to prove .    hence , from gleason theorem , we know that , among all the equivalent distributions , there is always one @xmath72 equal to a convex combination of dirac - delta functions .",
    "notice that the function @xmath72 provides us with all the information encoded in the density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "as a probability density , it allows us to define the average values of the observables , and in the form @xmath92 , it allows us to read the spectrum of @xmath4 from the set of critical points .",
    "this result allows us to realize in terms of @xmath72 any quantum system : as the average values coincide with those obtained from the spectral decomposition of the density matrix , we can use it to implement any desired model .",
    "we will see a practical example in the following sections .",
    "finally , we would like to analyze purity in this geometrical context .",
    "we saw in section [ sec : notion - decoherence ] that purity preservation is encoded in the behavior of @xmath4 as a projector .",
    "if the evolution of the system preserves the purity of the density matrix we say that the evolution is * purity - preserving * , while in the other case , we call it * purity non - preserving*.    our first task is to express in this geometrical language the concept of purity",
    ". consider the following expression for any @xmath102 : @xmath103 then , @xmath104 if the state is pure and @xmath105 if the state is mixed .",
    "this is so because , trivially , @xmath106    let us now mention how this change in the purity of the state can be detected in the measurement of average values of observables .",
    "recall that a change in the purity as above produces a transformation at the level of the states such that a pure state corresponding to a distribution of the form @xmath107 becomes a distribution of the form @xmath108 , where there is more than one value of @xmath109 different from zero .",
    "then , it is immediate to prove that the average value of a generic observable @xmath12 will be different between one case and the other .",
    "in this section , we will now extend the previous construction to the ehrenfest case , by combining it with the approach introduced in ref .  .",
    "first , let the physical states of our ehrenfest system correspond to the points in the cartesian product @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the phase space of the classical system .",
    "the physical observables will be now functions defined on that manifold . to define statistical averages of observables depending on classical and quantum degrees of freedom ( i.e. , functions as @xmath112 ) we consider @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents the classical degrees of freedom , @xmath115 the quantum ones , and",
    "@xmath116 is the volume on the state space manifold @xmath22 .",
    "we can now ask what properties we must require from @xmath117 in order for eq .   to correctly define the statistical mechanics for the ehrenfest dynamics ( ed ) .",
    "analogously to what happened in the quantum case , the conditions are as follows :    * the expected value of any constant observable should be equal to that constant , which implies that the integral on the whole set of states is equal to one : @xmath118 * the average , for any purely quantum observable @xmath63 of the form in  , associated to a positive definite hermitian operator @xmath12 , should be positive .",
    "this implies the usual requirement of positive probability density in standard classical statistical mechanics .    in ref .",
    ", it was proved that the ed defined on the manifold @xmath22 is hamiltonian with respect to the poisson bracket @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents the usual poisson bracket of the classical degrees of freedom , and @xmath121 represents the poisson bracket defined by eq .  .",
    "being hamiltonian , we know that we can define an invariant measure on the space of states @xmath22 .",
    "we shall denote such a measure by @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the dynamics defined on the microstates is straightforwardly translated into the probability density @xmath117 as a liouville equation : @xmath123 where @xmath70 is the hamiltonian function of the ehrenfest system : @xmath124 analogously , the evolution of any function @xmath112 is given by @xmath125    again , this property provides us with a natural candidate for the volume element @xmath122 ( and , for analogous reasons , also for @xmath126 ) arising from the symplectic form which gives its hamiltonian structure to the liouville equation in this context .",
    "as it happens in the pure quantum case , this volume form is preserved by the dynamics ( see ref .  ) .    with this in mind",
    ", we can consider the analogue of the objects introduced in the previous section .",
    "hence , given an ehrenfest system in a state described by a probability density @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we can consider the definition of the operator @xmath130 which still depends on the classical variables @xmath131 and , therefore , it can be interpreted as having turned the phase - space representation of the quantum part into the more familiar one based on density matrices .",
    "also , since we have not integrated over @xmath131 , this object still represents in a certain way a probability density in the classical part of the space .    as for any @xmath131-dependent operator ( see ref .  ) , we can define the associated phase - space function : @xmath132    it is also possible to integrate again the object in eq .",
    "( [ eq:25 ] ) , and define : @xmath133 which is a purely quantum object encoding the averaged information of the complete system .",
    "notice that , as it is usually done and in order to lighten the notation , we will often use the same symbol for different objects ( as in @xmath134 and @xmath4 ) , understanding that it is the explicit indication of the variables on which they depend what distinguishes them notationally . also , for simplicity , we use the same symbols for operators in the full - quantum case in sec .",
    "[ sec : gqsm ] , and for the ones in the quantum - classical scheme in this section .",

    "[ sec : gqsm ] .      consider the following initial distribution evolving under ed : @xmath151    this system is completely deterministic and , therefore , the liouville equation will produce exactly , as a solution , the integral curves of ed @xmath152 .",
    "thus we can write : @xmath153    consider now a slightly more complex system , consituted by a distribution of @xmath1 equally probable classical states , and a pure quantum state at @xmath154 : @xmath155    we can also write the marginal distributions as we did in section [ s:4.a ] : @xmath156    the evolution of such a system becomes @xmath157 where @xmath158 represents the ehrenfest trajectory having @xmath159 as initial condition .",
    "the evolved marginal distribution in the quantum manifold is now : @xmath160 and then , using eq .",
    ", we have : @xmath161 where , of course , @xmath162    the associated density matrix at time @xmath45 reads : @xmath163 and at time @xmath49 : @xmath164    now , the purity at time @xmath49 is @xmath165 but at a general time @xmath45 , @xmath166    hence , the purity of the system seems to evolve in time , in general in an involved way .",
    "we can compute , though , its time derivatives , in order to get an idea about its initial evolution .",
    "after some calculations which we detail in appendix  [ app : derivatives ] , one can see that , for the initial state considered in this section , we have @xmath167 and @xmath168 which is negative definite unless the expectation value of @xmath169 at @xmath138 vanishes .",
    "this means that the purity evolves from its initial value , and it does so by decreasing , which is entirely expected if we realized that we started from a state in which the purity is maximal .",
    "thus , we can see that the evolution has made a quantum - pure system become a quantum - mixed one , and we can claim that :    the statistical ehrenfest evolution is purity non - preserving for hamiltonians with quantum - classical couplings .",
    "this is the main result of our paper : even though the ed of a single - trajectory state does preserve purity , when we consider a statistical state the behavior changes . in the case above ( and as we will see numerically in the next section ) , we show how it is possible to transfer uncertainty from the classical domain into the quantum one .",
    "analogously , it is straightforward to see that an analogous process happens when we consider a single classical state coupled to an ensemble of quantum states .",
    "this uncertainty transfer takes place whenever the dynamics of the quantum and the classical subsystems are coupled to each other , since such coupling produces a splitting of the trajectories from the given initial conditions and thus the mixing of the final states .",
    "to illustrate the concepts introduced in the previous section and to see the purity change in a complex numerical case , let us consider a situation with an equally probable initial distribution as in eq .   of classical particles with @xmath170 and a quantum part constituted by a 10-level system .",
    "such a system has been used in the literature as a natural framework for molecular dynamics ( see for example refs .  ) .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian function for the quantum - classical system of the following form : @xmath171 where @xmath172",
    "are canonically conjugated classical variables and @xmath12 and @xmath62 are hermitian matrices acting on the quantum vector space @xmath173 .",
    "the classical part is written in action - angle coordinates to simplify the analysis .",
    "the dynamics of the system is obtained from the solutions of the @xmath1 different trajectories with initial conditions defined by each one of elements of the initial classical distribution @xmath174 .",
    "the resulting distribution takes thus the form given by eq .  .",
    "as it can be found in the supplementary material , for all the trajectories presented below the initial conditions for the classical subsystem are chosen as @xmath175 the points were fixed as five random points in the interval @xmath176 $ ] . choosing different initial conditions leads to equivalent results .",
    "the quantum initial condition is chosen to be , for all five trajectories , @xmath177    the evolution defines thus a equiprobable distribution of @xmath1 quantum - classical single trajectories @xmath178 .",
    "for each trajectory , the equations of motion are of ehrenfest type and they are given by eqs .",
    " , with @xmath179 .",
    "these dynamical equations exhibit two different regimes :    * for @xmath180 or @xmath181 , the classical and the quantum subsystems evolve uncoupled .",
    "the purity of the quantum subsystem is always equal to one . * for non - zero coupling constants and classical momenta ,",
    "the behavior of the system depends sharply on the initial conditions : the evolution from different initial conditions for the classical subsystems is very different .",
    "the purity tends then to evolve to the purity corresponding to a set of five random projectors on 1-dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space .",
    "the evolution of the purity of the resulting system is obtained from eq .   after integrating the dynamics numerically .",
    "some interesting observations can be extracted from the results :    * in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we represent the evolution of the purity for a fixed value of the coupling constant @xmath182 and increasing value for the initial condition of the classical momentum @xmath183 .",
    "we see how this makes the system change its originally integrable behavior and become more and more chaotic .",
    "+   and @xmath184 ( dashed green line ) , @xmath185 ( red line ) , @xmath186 ( blue line ) and @xmath187 ( brown line).we also depict the reference ( black line ) of the level of purity of a distribution of @xmath170 random projectors on @xmath173.,width=302 ] * instead , we can consider a fixed value of the initial classical momentum and increase the value of the coupling .",
    "it can be remarked that the system reaches the level of purity of the set of random projectors much faster than in the previous case , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "+   and @xmath180 ( dashed green line ) , @xmath188 ( blue line ) , and @xmath189 ( red line ) .",
    "again , the reference ( black line ) represents the level of purity of a distribution of @xmath170 random projectors on @xmath173.,width=302 ]    the interesting behaviour of the purity shown for some values of the parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( brown line ) and  [ fig:4 ] ( red line ) , in which its value rapidly decreases to a given low one and fluctuates around it after that , can be explained as a consequence of the dynamics mentioned before . if the system exhibits sensitive dependence on the initial conditions , after a small lapse of time , the different trajectories become decorrelated from one another in the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , the density matrix becomes the normalized sum of @xmath1 rank one projectors chosen at random .",
    "in this situation , it can be shown ( see appendix [ app : random ] ) that the purity is distributed around an expected value @xmath190 = \\frac{n+d-1}{nd},\\ ] ] which is represented by the black straight lines in the figures , with fluctuations of size @xmath191   - \\operatorname{e}[\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho^2)]^2\\right)^{1/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\   = & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{nd}\\left(\\frac{(n-1)(d-1)}{n(d+1)}\\right)^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the total number of trajectories used and @xmath0 is the dimension of the quantum hilbert space .",
    "notice that if @xmath0 is very large , the expected value for the purity tends to its minimal value @xmath192 and the fluctuations tend to zero .",
    "remember that the degree of mixture of a quantum system ranges from the pure state case ( i.e. , purity equals to one ) , for which the density operator is a projector on a one dimensional subspace of the hilbert space and the maximal mixture case ( thus minimum purity ) which corresponds to a density operator which is proportional to the identity matrix . as it must have trace equal to one , the proportionality factor is equal to the inverse of the dimension of the hilbert space .    figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and  [ fig:4 ] show also the effect of the coupling between the classical and the quantum subsystems , as well as the effect of the momentum ( or equivalently , the energy ) of the classical particles on the evolution of purity",
    ". the greater the strength of the coupling and the energy of the classical particle , the faster the system reaches its asymptotic behavior .",
    "although clearly the coupling has a stronger effect .",
    "thus , analogously to what happens in the case of molecular dynamics , where the velocity of the classical nuclei induces the coupling between all the eigenstates of the electronic hamiltonian , we see here that it also has the effect of mixing the quantum part if the ehrenfest system is treated statistically .    from our analysis and example , we can then conclude that statistical ehrenfest dynamics provides a framework in which the evolution affects the quantum dynamics in at least one way decoherence does .",
    "changing the degree of mixture of the quantum state is certainly one of the most relevant effects of electronic decoherence on molecular systems , although further work is required to analyze whether or not other decoherence effects can be explained by our construction .",
    "an appropriate description of the electronic decoherence in molecular systems is on the wishlist of every quantum - classical dynamics scheme .",
    "in which amount each theoretical model includes the sought effects is a complicated question whose answer will depend both on the model and on the intended application . loosely speaking",
    ", we could expect the different models to range from ` no electronic decoherence at all ' ( e.g. , bomd ) to ` a perfect description of quantum electronic decoherence ' ( say , full quantum dynamics of electrons and nuclei ) , with most of them lying somewhere in between the two extremes .",
    "several methods @xcite have been developed to deal with the problem but , to our knowledge , without a definitive solution .",
    "pure ehrenfest dynamics ( ed for single states ) clearly lies in the ` no decoherence at all ' side of the spectrum , since it does not even allow the change of purity .",
    "however , if we are willing to accept the possibility that the electrons evolve into a mixed state , i.e. , a statistically uncertain electronic state , then , to perform a coherent analysis , we should also allow the initial conditions of the nuclei to be described statistically .",
    "this point of view was used in some of the papers mentioned above when considered within surface - hopping or decay - of - mixing formalisms . in this work",
    "we implement the idea using the statistical description of ehrenfest dynamics introduced in ref .",
    "combined with a specially convenient geometric formalism we introduce . using these methods , one can observe that a system starting from uncertain nuclear initial conditions and a pure electronic state evolves into a situation in which the electronic state is no longer pure but mixed , i.e. , ed is capable of transferring uncertainty between the nuclei and the electrons .",
    "besides , our method provides us also with tools to compute in a simple but rigorous way the purity change , and it indicates an interesting dependence of the effect on the number of trajectories @xmath1 and the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath0 , as well as on the coupling and the velocity ( or energy ) of the classical system . ` how much ' decoherence the statistical ed contains , as related to interesting practical applications or to other mixed quantum - classical schemes,@xcite is a complex and important question that we shall explore in future works .",

    "in this appendix we derive the expected value of the purity and its fluctuations when the density matrix is obtained from the sum of decorrelated , random , rank - one projectors .",
