    "part of the interest in molecule - based magnets arises from the potential for forming low - dimensional structures with anisotropic physical properties . in this paper",
    ", we report on the magnetic behavior of quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) fe - cn - ni grid networks , in which each magnetic layer is both structurally and magnetically isolated .",
    "et al . _ have developed a unique langmuir - blodgett ( lb ) synthesis method to transfer monolayers of a 2d fe - cn - ni grid network , formed at the air - water interface , as thin films onto various substrates @xcite .",
    "this technique generates a new low - dimensional network which can not be formed from homogeneous reaction conditions .",
    "the structure of the resulting assemblies of mixed - spin fe - cn - ni bilayers transferred as thin films onto mylar is shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 . each deposition cycle produces a bilayer of the inorganic grid network sandwiched between an organic layer .",
    "the lb films have been structurally characterized by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , ft - ir spectroscopy , x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) , and grazing incidence synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( gixd ) .",
    "these probes have allowed for the identification of a face - centered square grid structure with an fe@xmath0@xmath4ni@xmath2 separation of 5.1  , and an average structural domain size of 3600 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "adjacent bilayers are separated by @xmath6 50  , and are effectively isolated from each other .",
    "the existence of ferromagnetic exchange between the low spin fe@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and ni@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) ions is expected after consideration of the exchange interaction in other cyanide bridged fe@xmath0@xmath4ni@xmath2 systems @xcite . the ferromagnetic behavior in these and other metal cyanides has been rationalized by considering the d - orbital symmetries for the unpaired electrons in the respective metal centers .",
    "the magnetic orbital on the fe@xmath0 center is of t@xmath7 symmetry while the two ni@xmath2 spins are in orbitals of e@xmath8 symmetry .",
    "the different symmetry orbitals do not overlap via the cyanide ligand , thereby resulting in the parallel alignment of the spins according to hund s rule @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of a sample containing 150 bilayers of the fe - cn - ni network on each side of a mylar film ( 10 cm@xmath5 ) were investigated using squid magnetometry .",
    "measurements were performed with the applied magnetic field oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "the field cooled ( fc ) magnetization versus temperature for both orientations , measured in a field of 2 mt , are shown in fig .",
    "2 . both orientations show a break at a t@xmath10 of 10 k , and the saturated behavior below 5 k indicates the presence of magnetically ordered domains .",
    "the presence of long - range magnetic order at 2 k was verified by the measurements shown in fig .",
    "the material shows clear hysteresis loops with coercive fields of 14 mt ( parallel orientation ) and 11 mt ( perpendicular orientation ) .",
    "the assignment of a ferromagnetic state was made based on high field magnetization studies performed at the national high magnetic field laboratory , tallahassee ( nhmfl ) .",
    "the magnetization of the film was measured up to 30 t using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( inset ) , the magnetization of the sample saturates around 20 t without evidence for a spin - flop transition . the increased noise above 15 t is due to the addition of a second dc power supply generating the magnetic field .",
    "the absence of a spin flop discriminates against antiferromagnetic coupling and the presence of a ferrimagnetic state .",
    "a stronger magnetization measured in the parallel orientation in the m _ vs. _",
    "t plot in fig .",
    "2 indicates that the magnetic easy axis is within the xy directions parallel to the film planes .",
    "consistently , in the low field limit ( b @xmath11 b@xmath12 , where b@xmath12 is the applied filed at which m saturates , m@xmath12 ) , the magnetization in the parallel orientation changes more rapidly than in the perpendicular orientation with respect to changes in the external field . this behavior is most likely due to a combination of the single ion anisotropies of the metal centers and the reduced symmetry of the low - dimensional material . in summary ,",
    "a 2d fe - ni cyanide - bridged network with a face - centered square grid structure has been generated using a langmuir - blodgett ( lb ) synthesis method , and the magnetic study on this film shows the presence of ferromagnetism .",
