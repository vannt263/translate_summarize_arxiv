    "the amplitudes for the three @xmath3 decays can be expressed in terms of color - allowed and color - suppressed tree as well as exchange topologies .",

    "the ratio @xmath22 is a measure of the departure from the heavy - quark limit  @xcite , and has been measured by the cleo  @xcite and babar collaborations @xcite .    using updated information on the nonleptonic branching ratios",

    "the corresponding isospin relations read as @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 so that @xmath26 @xmath27 which leads to the following expression , @xmath28 the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 amplitudes can be depicted in the complex plane , and related to the ratio of isospin amplitudes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] .    the absolute values of the amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 can also be obtained directly from the measured decay rates : @xmath32 , i.e. corrected for the small differences in phase space , which mainly leads to a small but measurable correction for @xmath33 final state .",
    "the relative strong phase between the @xmath21 and @xmath20 amplitudes can be calculated with @xmath34 and similar for @xmath35 .",
    "( 250,210)(0,0 ) ( -70,-30 )    we find the following numerical results : @xmath36 which are complemented by @xmath37 the nominal value is calculated from the central values of the branching fractions , whereas the @xmath38 confidence interval is defined as the integral of 68.3% of the total area of its likelihood function , similar to the procedure followed in ref .",
    "the corresponding central values for the strong phases then become @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 case , respectively .    comparing with ( [ iso - rat ] ) ,",
    "we observe that the isospin - amplitude ratio shows significant deviations from the heavy - quark limit . in view of our analysis of the exchange topologies in section  [ sec : e ] and the expression in ( [ iso - rat - calc ] ) we can trace this feature back to the color - suppressed @xmath16 topologies .",
    "let us next probe the impact of nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking corrections in @xmath0-meson decays into heavy - light final states . to this end",
    ", we compare the three @xmath3 decays with their @xmath5-related @xmath43 channels , which have decay amplitudes of the following structure : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here the notation is as above and the primes remind us again that we are dealing with @xmath48 quark - level transitions in this case . in order to quantify the validity of the @xmath5 flavor symmetry , we can perform the following four experimental tests :    * consistency between @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; * consistency between @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; * ratio of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; * prediction for @xmath52 , based on all amplitudes listed in table  [ tab : tec ] apart from @xmath57 .    tests ( ii  iv ) can be performed with both the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 systems . on the other hand , due to the large uncertainty affecting @xmath60 , test ( i ) can currently only be applied to the @xmath61 case .",
    "we will use the values for the branching fractions as listed in table  [ tab : tec ] .",
    "the size of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 amplitudes are internally consistent , as is shown by the overlapping circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso ] . as we noted already in section",
    "[ sec : e ] , this also indicates that there are no large nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking effects in the @xmath49 or @xmath50 amplitudes .",
    "( 250,210)(0,0 ) ( -70,-30 )    similarly to eq.([eq : teovertratio ] ) we can check the consistency between the @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 amplitudes . as before we will correct the @xmath53 amplitudes from @xmath62 for factorizable @xmath5-breaking corrections , to allow for a direct comparison with the @xmath63 amplitude , @xmath64 where we use the parametrization for @xmath65 from ref .",
    "we extract the following ratio of @xmath66 and @xmath67 amplitudes : @xmath68 where the factorizable @xmath5-breaking corrections are taken into account .",
    "again , the ratio is close to 1 , indicating that the contribution of @xmath69 is small , and that there are no unexpected nonfactorizable @xmath5 violating effects , in addition to the factorizable @xmath5 corrections .",
    "this is remarkable in view of the nonfactorizable character of the color - suppressed decays .",
    "a direct measure of the size of @xmath5-breaking effects in @xmath70 decays is provided by the ratio of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 amplitudes : @xmath71 where the ratio of branching ratios has been measured for the @xmath72 case as follows @xcite : @xmath73 if we include factorizable @xmath5-breaking effects through the corresponding decay constants and form factors , the numerical values of the relevant amplitude ratios are given as follows : @xmath74 @xmath75 the factorizable @xmath5-breaking effects for the @xmath16 amplitudes ( [ c - su3 ] ) are numerically close to the ones for the @xmath76 amplitudes ( [ t - su3 ] ) , and since the @xmath76 amplitude is the dominant amplitude here , we rescale in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ t - su3 ] ) .",
    "the consistency with 1 is remarkable . in particular",
    ", we find that nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking effects are smaller than 5% , even in decays that have a large contribution from color - suppressed amplitudes where factorization does not work well , as we have seen in the previous section .",

    "the consistency between the corresponding value and the measured value for @xmath80 from @xmath81 is a direct probe for nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking effects in nonleptonic decays of the type @xmath70 .",
    "the numerical picture for the @xmath41 and @xmath82 cases is still not precise enough to predict the measured value : @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , where @xmath52 is rescaled to @xmath85 according to eq .",
    "( [ e - su3 ] ) .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath86 and @xmath53 will probably be improved in the near future , which will provide another interesting test of the validity of the @xmath5 flavor symmetry .    in the factorization tests discussed above",

    "interesting information on @xmath5-breaking effects can be obtained from the comparison between the polarization amplitudes of @xmath87 and @xmath88 decays , which are found in excellent agreement with one another @xcite . moreover ,",
    "also analyses of @xmath89 and @xmath90 modes and their comparison with @xmath91 decays do not show any indications of large nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking corrections @xcite .",

    "as we have seen in section  [ sec : e ] , the impact of the exchange topology on the @xmath120 decays is small .",
    "consequently , this channel looks at first sight also interesting for another implementation of the method for the determination of @xmath9 at lhcb proposed by us in ref .",
    "here we have to compare it with the @xmath121 channel .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction of the @xmath122 is challenging at lhcb .",
    "however , the @xmath123 and @xmath124 modes are nicely accessible at this experiment . in view of the similar patterns of the modes involving @xmath125 and @xmath126 mesons discussed above",
    ", we expect that also in the @xmath123 channel the exchange amplitude plays a minor role .",

    "the difference of @xmath131 from unity at the order of 5% discussed in section  [ sec : t ] leads to an uncertainty of about @xmath132 on the theoretical prediction of the hadronic branching ratio . assuming an @xmath5 suppression in the @xmath133 factor introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath134 by a factor @xmath135 , which is still generous in view of the analysis of the @xmath5-breaking effects in section  [ sec : su3 ] , we arrive at an uncertainty of about 2% for @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "this experimentally constrained error is fully consistent with the theoretical discussion given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath136 form factors entering @xmath137 have so far received only small theoretical attention . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such effects were explored using heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory , while qcd sum - rule techniques were applied in ref .",
    "@xcite . the numerical value given in the latter paper yields @xmath138 .",
    "finally , in contrast to the determination of @xmath139 by means of the @xmath130 , @xmath8 system @xcite , we have to deal with the @xmath140 factor in ( [ fs - det ] ) . using ( [ eq : teovertratio ] ) and adding an additional 5% uncertainty to account for possible differences between the @xmath126 and @xmath125 cases , we obtain @xmath141 .",
    "interestingly , the cdf collaboration has already published the ratio  @xcite : @xmath142 after taking the branching fractions of the @xmath126-mesons into account , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we obtain : @xmath145 if we use now eq .",
    "( [ fs - det ] ) , we can convert this number into a value of @xmath139 .",
    "assuming @xmath146 and @xmath147 , we obtain the nonleptonic result @xmath148 for @xmath149 , where all errors have been added in quadrature . here",
    "we have a theoretical error of 8.2% on top of an experimental error of 9.4% from ( [ eq : cdfb2dpi ] ) and @xmath150 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect @xmath151 , which may result in a decrease of @xmath152 . lattice results of the form - factor ratio entering @xmath137 will hopefully be available soon . in order to surpass the possible future experimental uncertainty , knowledge on the corresponding @xmath5-breaking corrections",
    "would be needed at the @xmath153 level .",
    "it is interesting to compare the result in ( [ fsfd - hadronic ] ) with the published ratio of fragmentation functions extracted from semi - inclusive @xmath154 decays @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath155 signal yields are related to the number of produced @xmath156 hadrons by assuming the @xmath5 flavor symmetry and neglecting @xmath5-breaking corrections ( i.e.   @xmath157 , which corresponds to @xmath158 ) .",
    "together with an earlier result using double semi - leptonic decays ( containing two muons and either a @xmath159 or a @xmath160 meson )  @xcite , the average value @xmath161 was obtained  @xcite , which can be written as @xmath162 the consistency of this result with ( [ fsfd - hadronic ] ) is remarkable .",
    "note that the uncertainties on the @xmath163 and @xmath164-meson reconstruction efficiencies are expected to be correlated in ( [ fsfd - hadronic ] ) and ( [ fsfd - leptonic ] ) .",
    "as the mode @xmath165 is cabibbo - favored with respect to the @xmath166 channel , it allows an early measurement of the hadronization fraction at lhcb .",
    "moreover , the possibility of using @xmath167 offers a useful experimental handle to keep systematic uncertainties due to particle identification under control .",
    "these decays can be reconstructed with @xmath168 and @xmath169 final states .",
    "the uncertainty on the ratio of the two efficiencies @xmath170 is expected to be small since the topology is the same and the main difference is the particle identification of one of the kaons coming from the charmed meson .",
    "the number of events in @xmath171  @xcite is expected to be @xmath172 for @xmath7 and about @xmath173 smaller ( depending on the value of @xmath9 ) for @xmath124 , with @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "therefore this would allow lhcb to make a precise measurement of @xmath9 with a few tens @xmath176 .",
    "we have considered nonleptonic @xmath0-meson decays of the kind @xmath1 and have performed tests of how well these channels are described by factorization and @xmath5 flavor - symmetry relations . using data from semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays to determine the relevant @xmath177 form factors , we could not resolve nonfactorizable effects within the current experimental precision , which is as small as about @xmath178 in the most fortunate cases .",
    "using data on nonleptonic decays to probe exchange topologies , we obtained a picture with amplitudes as naively expected , i.e.  without any enhancement due to long - distance effects .",
    "however , in an isospin analysis of the @xmath3 system , we found significant corrections to the heavy - quark limit , which could be traced back to nonfactorizable contributions to color - suppressed tree contributions .",
    "concerning the @xmath5 flavor symmetry , we did not find any indication for nonfactorizable @xmath5-breaking corrections , with a resolution as small as @xmath178 .",
    "these results support  from an experimental point of view  the intrinsic theoretical errors for a determination of the ratio @xmath139 of fragmentation functions from a simultaneous measurement of the @xmath179 and @xmath8 modes , as proposed and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we found an interesting variant of this method , which arises if we replace the @xmath179 channel by @xmath7 . in this case , we have then also to deal with a contribution from an exchange topology , which we constrain experimentally .",
    "interestingly , the cdf collaboration has already published a ratio of the corresponding event numbers , which we can convert into @xmath180 , with a smaller error than and in excellent agreement with the result from analyses of semi - leptonic decays at cdf .",
    "it should be noted that in these values @xmath5-breaking effects in the ratio of the relevant @xmath181 and @xmath136 form factors were neglected , which could reduce the value of @xmath139 . in the near future ,",
    "precise lattice calculations of this quantity should become available .",
    "the extraction of @xmath139 from the @xmath8 , @xmath7 system , as proposed in this paper , is interesting for the early data taking at lhcb .",
