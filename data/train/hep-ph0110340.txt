    "a muon collider with c.m . energy centered at the higgs boson mass offers a unique opportunity to produce higgs bosons in the @xmath0-channel and thereby measure the higgs masses , total width and several partial widths to very high precision . in the event that only a sm - like higgs boson is discovered and its properties measured at the tevatron , the lhc , and a lc , it may prove essential to build a muon collider to fully explore the higgs sector . in particular , the very narrow width of a standard model ( sm ) higgs bosons can not be measured _ directly _ at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or at a future linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "furthermore , there are regions of parameter space for which it will be impossible for either the lhc or a lc to discover the heavier higgs bosons of supersymmetry or , in the case of a general two - higgs - doublet or more extended model , higgs bosons of any mass with small or zero @xmath2 coupling",
    ".    the value of a future higgs factory should be discussed in light of recent experimental data . while by no means definitive , recent experimental results point in promising directions for higgs factories .",
    "first , there is the @xmath3 statistical evidence from lep@xcite for a higgs boson near @xmath4  gev .",
    "such a mass is in the optimal range for study at a higgs factory and it is for such a low mass that the muon collider factory option would add the most information to data from the lhc and a lc .",
    "first , @xmath5 is sufficiently above the @xmath6-pole that the background from @xmath6 production and decay to @xmath7 is not so large , and the mass is sufficiently below the @xmath8 threshold that the decay width remains small and the ability of the muon collider to achieve a very narrow beam energy spread can be exploited .",
    "second , it is for masses below @xmath9 that the lc will have difficulty getting a precision measurement of the higgs to @xmath10 branching ratio , resulting in large error for the indirect determination of the total higgs width . of course , a higgs boson in this mass range , and having substantial @xmath2 coupling , is also the most natural interpretation of current precision electroweak data . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a higgs mass of @xmath11  gev is very suggestive of supersymmetry . in the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm )",
    "such a mass is near the theoretical upper limit of @xmath12  gev , and would indicate a value of the supersymmetry parameter @xmath13 substantially above 1 ( assuming stop masses @xmath14 ) .",
    "a higgs with mass @xmath11  gev in the context of a large-@xmath15 supersymmetry scenario would mesh nicely with recent evidence for an anomalous magnetic moment of the muon@xcite that deviates from the standard model prediction .",
    "the @xmath16 discrepancy is naturally accounted for provided @xmath13 is relatively large ( and superparticle masses are not too heavy ) .",
    "more specifically , a supersymmetric interpretation of this discrepancy with the sm prediction implies the following relationship between the mass scale @xmath17 of supersymmetric particles contributing to the one - loop anomalous magnetic moment diagram and @xmath13@xcite , @xmath18 furthermore , if the anomalous magnetic moment is explained by supersymmetry the value of the higgs mass parameter @xmath19 of supersymmetric models has a sign which is consistent with the constraints from the radiative decays , @xmath20 .",
    "thus , a consistent picture begins to emerge suggesting low - energy supersymmetry with a higgs boson in the predicted mass range .",
    "while these recent experimental data are not definitive , they do point to an interesting scenario whereby a muon collider might prove essential to the understanding of the higgs sector of a supersymmetric model .",
    "the muon collider could perform at least two measurements crucial for detailing a susy higgs sector : ( 1 ) accurately measuring the properties of a light sm - like higgs boson and distinguishing it from a supersymmetric higgs bosons , and ( 2 ) discovering heavy higgs bosons of supersymmetry and accurately measuring their properties .",
    "muon colliders have a number of unique features that make them attractive candidates for future accelerators@xcite .",
    "the most important and fundamental of these derive from the large mass of the muon in comparison to that of the electron .",
    "this leads to : a ) the possibility of extremely narrow beam energy spreads , especially at beam energies below @xmath21 ; b ) the possibility of accelerators with very high energy ; c ) the possibility of employing storage rings at high energy ; d ) the possibility of using decays of accelerated muons to provide a high luminosity source of neutrinos ( under active consideration as reviewed elsewhere ) ; e ) increased potential for probing physics in which couplings increase with mass ( as does the sm @xmath22 coupling ) .",
    "here our focus is on the higgs sector .",
    "the relatively large mass of the muon compared to the mass of the electron means that the coupling of higgs bosons to @xmath23 is very much larger than to @xmath24 , implying much larger @xmath0-channel higgs production rates at a muon collider as compared to an electron collider [ see fig .",
    "[ feyn - diag ] ] . for higgs bosons with a very small mev scale width , such as a light sm higgs boson ,",
    "production rates in the @xmath0-channel are further enhanced by the muon collider s ability to achieve beam energy spreads comparable to the tiny higgs width .",
    "in addition , there is little bremsstrahlung , and the beam energy can be tuned to one part in a million through continuous spin - rotation measurements@xcite . due to these important qualitative differences between the two types of machines ,",
    "only muon colliders can be advocated as potential @xmath0-channel higgs factories capable of determining the mass and decay width of a higgs boson to very high precision@xcite .",
    "high rates of higgs production at @xmath25 colliders rely on substantial @xmath2higgs coupling for the @xmath26higgs ( higgs - strahlung ) or @xmath27higgs ( @xmath28 fusion ) reactions , in contrast , a @xmath29 collider can provide a factory for producing a higgs boson with little or no @xmath2 coupling so long as it has sm - like ( or enhanced ) @xmath29 couplings .        of course , there is a trade - off between small beam energy spread , @xmath30 , and luminosity .",
    "current estimates for yearly integrated luminosities ( using @xmath31@xmath32s@xmath33 as implying @xmath34 ) are : @xmath35 at @xmath36 for beam energy resolutions of @xmath37 , respectively ; @xmath38 at @xmath39 , respectively , for @xmath40 . despite this , studies show that for small higgs width the @xmath0-channel production rate ( and statistical significance over background ) is maximized by choosing @xmath41 to be such that @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , in the sm context this corresponds to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "if the @xmath45 lep signal is real or if the interpretation of the precision electroweak data as an indication of a light higgs boson ( with substantial @xmath2 coupling ) is valid ,   coupling and yet good agreement with precision electroweak data maintained @xcite .",
    "] then both @xmath25 and @xmath29 colliders will be valuable . in this scenario",
    "the higgs boson would have been discovered at a previous higher energy collider ( possibly a muon collider running at high energy ) , and then the higgs factory would be built with a center - of - mass energy precisely tuned to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the most likely scenario is that the higgs boson is discovered at the lhc via gluon fusion ( @xmath46 ) or perhaps earlier at the tevatron via associated production ( @xmath47 ) , and its mass is determined to an accuracy of about 100  mev . if a linear collider has also observed the higgs via the higgs - strahlung process ( @xmath48 ) , one might know the higgs boson mass to better than 50  mev with an integrated luminosity of @xmath49  fb@xmath33 .",
    "the muon collider would be optimized to run at @xmath50 , and this center - of - mass energy would be varied over a narrow range so as to scan over the higgs resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ mhsmscan ] below ) .",
    "the production of a higgs boson ( generically denoted @xmath51 ) in the @xmath0-channel with interesting rates is a unique feature of a muon collider @xcite .",
    "the resonance cross section is @xmath52 in practice , however , there is a gaussian spread ( @xmath53 ) to the center - of - mass energy and one must compute the effective @xmath0-channel higgs cross section after convolution assuming some given central value of @xmath54 : _",
    "h(s ) & = & 1 _ h ( ) d    4m_h^2 . [ sigform ]        it is convenient to express @xmath53 in terms of the root - mean - square ( rms ) gaussian spread of the energy of an individual beam , @xmath41 : @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ rawsigform ] ) , it is apparent that a resolution @xmath56 is needed to be sensitive to the higgs width .",
    "further , eq .  ( [ sigform ] ) implies that @xmath57 for @xmath58 _ and _ that large event rates are only possible if @xmath59 is not so large that @xmath60 is extremely suppressed .",
    "the width of a light sm - like higgs is very small ( e.g. a few mev for @xmath61 ) , implying the need for @xmath41 values as small as @xmath62 for studying a light sm - like @xmath51 .",
    "[ mhsmscan ] illustrates the result for the sm higgs boson of an initial centering scan over @xmath54 values in the vicinity of @xmath63 .",
    "this figure dramatizes : a ) that the beam energy spread must be very small because of the very small @xmath64 ( when @xmath65 is small enough that the @xmath8 decay mode is highly suppressed ) ; b ) that we require the very accurate _ in situ _ determination of the beam energy to one part in a million through the spin precession of the muon noted earlier in order to perform the scan and then center on @xmath66 with a high degree of stability .",
    "if the @xmath51 has sm - like couplings to @xmath28 , its width will grow rapidly for @xmath67 and its @xmath0-channel production cross section will be severely suppressed by the resulting decrease of @xmath68 .",
    "more generally , any @xmath51 with sm - like or larger @xmath69 coupling will retain a large @xmath0-channel production rate when @xmath67 only if the @xmath70 coupling becomes strongly suppressed relative to the @xmath71 coupling .",
    "the general theoretical prediction within supersymmetric models is that the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson @xmath72 will be very similar to the @xmath73 when the other higgs bosons are heavy .",
    "this ` decoupling limit ' is very likely to arise if the masses of the supersymmetric particles are large ( since the higgs masses and the superparticle masses are typically similar in size for most boundary condition choices ) .",
    "thus , @xmath72 rates will be very similar to @xmath73 rates .",
    "in contrast , the heavier higgs bosons in a typical supersymmetric model decouple from @xmath2 at large mass and remain reasonably narrow . as a result , their @xmath0-channel production rates remain large .    for a sm - like @xmath51 , at @xmath74  gev and @xmath75 , the @xmath76 final state rates",
    "are @xmath77 the sm higgs cross sections and backgrounds are shown in fig .",
    "[ sm - higgs ] for @xmath75 and @xmath65 values such that the dominant decay mode is @xmath7 .",
    "an assessment of the need for a higgs factory requires that one detail the unique capabilities of a muon collider versus the other possible future accelerators as well as comparing the abilities of all the machines to measure the same higgs properties .",
    "muon colliders and a higgs factory in particular would only become operational after the lhc physics program is well - developed and quite possibly after a linear collider program is mature as well .",
    "so one important question is the following : if a sm - like higgs boson and , possibly , important physics beyond the standard model have been discovered at the lhc and perhaps studied at a linear collider , what new information could a higgs factory provide ?",
    "the @xmath0-channel production process allows one to determine the mass , total width , and the cross sections @xmath78 for several final states @xmath79 to very high precision .",
    "the higgs mass , total width and the cross sections can be used to constrain the parameters of the higgs sector .",
    "for example , in the mssm their precise values will constrain the higgs sector parameters @xmath80 and @xmath15 ( where @xmath15 is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets of the mssm ) .",
    "the main question is whether these constraints will be a valuable addition to lhc and lc constraints .",
    "the expectations for the luminosity available at linear colliders has risen steadily .",
    "the most recent studies assume an integrated luminosity of some @xmath49  fb@xmath33 corresponding to 1 - 2 years of running at a few@xmath81  fb@xmath33 per year .",
    "this luminosity results in the production of greater than @xmath82 higgs bosons per year through the bjorken higgs - strahlung process , @xmath83 , provided the higgs boson is kinematically accessible .",
    "this is comparable or even better than can be achieved with the current machine parameters for a muon collider operating at the higgs resonance ; in fact , recent studies have described high - luminosity linear colliders as `` higgs factories , '' though for the purposes of this report , we will reserve this term for muon colliders operating at the @xmath0-channel higgs resonance .",
    "a linear collider with such high luminosity can certainly perform quite accurate measurements of certain higgs parameters such as the higgs mass , couplings to gauge bosons , couplings to heavy quarks , etc.@xcite .",
    "precise measurements of the couplings of the higgs boson to the standard model particles is an important test of the mass generation mechanism . in the standard model with one higgs doublet ,",
    "this coupling is proportional to the particle mass . in the more general case there",
    "can be mixing angles present in the couplings .",
    "precision measurements of the couplings can distinguish the standard model higgs boson from the sm - like higgs boson typically present in a more general model .",
    "if deviations are found , their magnitude can be extremely crucial for constraining the parameters of the more general higgs sector .",
    "in particular , it might be possible to estimate the masses of the other higgs bosons of the extended higgs sector , thereby allowing a more focused search for them .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the accuracies possible at different colliders for measuring @xmath84 and @xmath59 of a sm - like @xmath51 with @xmath85 are given in table  [ unc - table ] . to achieve these accuracies ,",
    "one first determines the higgs mass to about 1  mev by the preliminary scan illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mhsmscan ] .",
    "then , a dedicated three - point fine scan@xcite near the resonance peak using @xmath86 of integrated luminosity ( corresponding to a few years of operation ) would be performed . for a sm higgs boson with a mass sufficiently below the @xmath8 threshold ,",
    "the higgs total width is very small ( of order several mev ) , and the only process where it can be measured _",
    "directly _ is in the @xmath0-channel at a muon collider .",
    "indirect determinations at the lc can have higher accuracy once @xmath84 is large enough that the @xmath8 mode rates can be accurately measured , requiring @xmath87 .",
    "this is because at the lc the total width must be determined indirectly by measuring a partial width and a branching fraction , and then computing the total width , @xmath88 for some final state @xmath79 . for a higgs boson so light that the @xmath8 decay mode is not useful , then the total width measurement would probably require use of the @xmath89 decays@xcite .",
    "this would require information from a photon collider as well as the lc and a small error is not possible .",
    "for @xmath90 , the muon collider can measure the total width of the higgs boson with greater precision than can be achieved using the indirect @xmath91 mode technique at the lc , and would be a very valuable input for precision tests of the higgs sector .",
    "in particular , since all the couplings of the standard model @xmath73 are known , @xmath64 is precisely predicted .",
    "therefore , the precise determination of @xmath59 obtained by this scan would be an important test of the standard model , and any deviation would be evidence for a nonstandard higgs sector ( or other new physics ) .",
    "in fact , a muon collider of limited luminosity can remain more than competitive with lhc + lc for discriminating between the sm @xmath73 and some sm - like @xmath51 even for @xmath84 values such that the lc obtains a good measurement of @xmath8 rates .",
    "as it happens , for @xmath92 there is a fortuitous compensation that results in @xmath93 being almost completely independent of the somewhat uncertain @xmath94 quark mass .",
    "very roughly , larger @xmath95 means larger @xmath96 but also larger @xmath59 .",
    "the latter implies a smaller convoluted cross section @xmath97 ( i.e. before including the branching ratio ) .",
    "further , larger @xmath59 means less damping because of beam energy spread .",
    "the result is that @xmath93 is essentially independent of the input @xmath95 value ( within reasonable limits ) @xcite .            as a result",
    ", the precise measurement of @xmath93 at a muon collider might provide the best single discriminator between the sm higgs and a sm - like higgs .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in the context of the mssm .",
    "for a higgs mass of 110  gev , and assuming a typical soft - supersymmetry - breaking scenario , fig .",
    "[ bound ] shows the resulting excluded regions of @xmath80 for the ( a ) lhc+lc , ( b ) with a muon collider with 0.2  fb@xmath33 integrated luminosity , and ( c ) with a muon collider with 10  fb@xmath33 integrated luminosity .",
    "some comments on these results are appropriate .",
    "first , one should note that the measurement of @xmath59 ( @xmath98  mev , i.e @xmath99 ) at the muon collider is not nearly so powerful a discriminator as the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) measurement of @xmath93 at @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "second , as @xmath84 increases and the @xmath8 decay mode becomes more prominent , much more accurate determinations of partial width ratios and the total width become possible at lhc+lc and the lhc+lc exclusion regions move rapidly to higher @xmath80 , but at best becoming comparable to the @xmath104 muon collider exclusion regions .",
    "third , the conclusion that with higher luminosities than the @xmath105 per year currently envisioned for the higgs factory this discriminator would have incredible sensitivity to @xmath80 assumes that systematic errors for the absolute cross section will be smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "fourth , we should note that there are high @xmath15 scenarios in which decoupling sets in very early in @xmath80 and no machine would be able to set a lower bound on @xmath80 ; in particular , for such scenarios it would be incorrect to conclude that the absence of deviations with respect to sm expectations implies that @xmath106 would be such that @xmath107 so that @xmath108 pair production is forbidden at a @xmath109 lc .",
    "finally , if there was a very light neutralino such that @xmath110 decays were possible , this would be known ahead of time and the @xmath111 rate prediction within the susy context would have to be corrected to very high precision to account for these additional decays .",
    "susy loop corrections to the @xmath112 coupling might also have to be accounted for to high precision if the susy spectrum turns out to be light .",
    "but these last two caveats also apply to the lc measurements .",
    "parameter space for @xmath113 .",
    "we have assumed a no - mixing susy scenario and employed @xmath114 . for maximal mixing , there is little change in the contours  only the size of the allowed range",
    "is altered . from @xcite.,width=336 ]    given the above sensitivity , the next question is the extent to which parameters of the superymmetric higgs sector can be determined with some reasonable level of precision . to study this ,",
    "an input mssm model was assumed with @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "various observables were computed as a function of @xmath80 and @xmath15 .",
    "let us for the moment imagine that @xmath119 can be computed theoretically with arbitrary accuracy in terms of the input susy model parameters .",
    "were this the case , then the value of @xmath119 would determine @xmath80 as a function of @xmath15 ( or vice versa ) given the fixed susy breaking scenario parameters . the @xmath112 event rate and , to a lesser extent ,",

    "is the extent to which experimental measurements of @xmath122 and @xmath120 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 would restrict the location along this line .",
    "the accuracy ( @xmath125\\mev$ ] ) with which @xmath119 can be determined experimentally at the muon collider would not significantly broaden this line .",
    "for the experimental accuracies of @xmath126 at the lhc and @xmath127 at the lc , the line turns into the ellipses of the upper figures of fig .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "unfortunately , due to the expected level of theoretical uncertainties in the computation of @xmath119 the muon collider results are certainly unrealistic and even the lhc+lc ellipses are probably overly optimistic .",
    "we estimate that one might eventually be able to achieve a theoretical accuracy of @xmath128 for the @xmath119 computation in terms of the model parameters .",

    "thus , the reality may be that lhc+lc ellipses of the upper half of fig .",
    "[ parameters ] will be substantially enlarged . in any case , the ellipse sizes in both cases would most probably be determined by the accuracy of the theoretical computation of @xmath119 as a function of susy parameters .",
    "a determination of the allowed elliptical regions including a reasonable level of systematic uncertainty for the @xmath119 computation should be made . despite this systematic uncertainty from the @xmath119 computation ,",

    "further , this is an absolutely direct and model independent determination of @xmath142 that for certain has no systematic theoretical uncertainties .",
    "of course , the caveat remains that there are peculiar mssm parameter choices for which ` decoupling ' occurs very rapidly and the @xmath143 coupling would be independent of @xmath80 .",

    "a higgs factory of even modest luminosity can provide uniquely powerful constraints on the parameter space of the supersymmetric model via the highly accurate determination of the total rate for @xmath111 ( which has almost zero theoretical systematic uncertainty due to its insensitivity to the unknown @xmath95 value ) , the moderately accurate determination of the @xmath72 s total width and the remarkably accurate , unique and model - independent determination of the @xmath153 coupling constant .",

    "<S> we outline the unique role of a muon collider as a higgs factory for higgs boson resonance production in the @xmath0-channel . </S>",
    "<S> physics examples include : the precision measurements of the higgs mass and total width , and the resulting ability to discriminate between the sm - like higgs bosons of different models such as between a light sm higgs boson and the light higgs boson of the mssm ; the determination of the spin and coupling via the @xmath1 decay mode ; differentiation of two nearly degenerate heavy higgs bosons by an energy scan ; and the ability to explore a general extended higgs sector , possibly with cp - violating couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the muon collider higgs factory could perform measurements that would be highly complementary to higgs studies at the lhc and lc ; it would be likely to play a very crucial role in fully understanding the higgs sector .    to </S>"
