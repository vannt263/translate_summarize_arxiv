    "of all the iron - based superconductors @xcite , alkali iron selenides @xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( @xmath7 k , rb , cs , tl ) @xcite are unique in that superconductivity in this class of materials always coexists with a static long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order with a large moment and high n@xmath8el temperature @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to iron pnictide superconductors @xcite where optimal superconductivity arises from the suppression of the static af order in their nonsuperconducting parent compounds @xcite .",
    "an attempt to understand the coexisting static af order and superconductivity in alkali iron selenides @xcite has produced two proposed scenarios . in the first , superconductivity is believed to coexist microscopically with the static af order @xcite .",
    "however , the af order in @xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 forms a @xmath3 block af structure with an ordered moment of @xmath93.3 @xmath10 per fe as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) @xcite , making it unclear how superconductivity can survive such a large magnetic field background arising from the ordered moments @xcite .",
    "alternatively , superconductivity in @xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 may arise from a chemically separated superconducting phase in the matrix of the insulating block af phase .",

    "for example , while some tem @xcite , x - ray scattering @xcite , and stm @xcite measurements suggest that the superconducting phase of @xmath6fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is @xmath12fe@xmath2se@xmath2 with the bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 iron pnictide crystal structure @xcite , other tem and stm measurements propose that the superconducting phase consists of a single fe vacancy for every eight fe - sites arranged in a @xmath13 parallelogram structure [ fig .",

    "since transport measurements are sensitive to paramagnetic tetragonal to iron vacancy ordered structural phase transition ( @xmath17 ) , af ordering ( @xmath39 ) , and superconductivity @xmath40 @xcite , samples from each batch were characterized by in - plane resistivity and magnetization to determine @xmath17 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 to be approximately 540 k , 500 k and 32 k in the superconducting sample and 520 k and 500 k in the insulator . from previous neutron diffraction work @xcite , we know that structural and magnetic phase transitions in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 occur above the room temperature . choosing only crystals from a single batch to minimize stoichiometry differences , we ground several grams of each composition into a fine powder and divided it into two sets .",

    "at base temperature , the @xmath3 iron vacancy order is already established and the square of iron in the center of the unit cell [ see inset in figure 3(a ) ] twists and contracts , leading to a slightly different intra- ( light ) and inter - square ( dark ) fe - fe bond distance @xcite . indeed , this is observed as two marked peaks near 2.7 angstroms in the pdf analysis of the insulating k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 [ fig .",

    ", one would expect integrated intensity of these peaks to be in a 2:1 ratio reflecting the number of such atomic pairs in the unit cell [ fig .",
    "while a quantitative comparison is difficult , a qualitative comparison to the superconducting and insulating samples is still instructive . in figure 3(b ) for the superconducting sample , we see that the intensity of [ fe - fe]@xmath34 is substantially larger compared to the same peak in the insulator despite comparable intensity of the [ fe - fe]@xmath2 peak .",
    "this discrepancy can only be understood assuming the presence of an additional phase in the superconducting sample with one fe - fe bond distance , consistent with rietveld analysis shown in fig .",
    "2 .    if we assume that the superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is phase pure in the high temperature paramagnetic state , it would be interesting to understand how it becomes phase separated at low temperatures .",

    "<S> we use neutron diffraction to study the temperature evolution of the average structure and local lattice distortions in insulating and superconducting potassium iron selenide k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . in the high temperature </S>",
    "<S> paramagnetic state , both materials have a single phase with crystal structure similar to that of the bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 family of iron pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> while the insulating k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 forms a @xmath3 iron vacancy ordered block antiferromagnetic ( af ) structure at low - temperature , the superconducting compounds spontaneously phase separate into an insulating part with @xmath3 iron vacancy order and a superconducting phase with chemical composition of k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath2 and bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , superconductivity in alkaline iron selenides arises from alkali deficient k@xmath4fe@xmath5se@xmath2 in the matrix of the insulating block af phase . </S>"
