    "this article is an extended version of the plenary talk given by the second author at the cimma 2005 in almeria .",
    "it is intended for a rather general audience and for this reason we start with explaining very elementary and wellknown facts : we apologize to the expert reader , who will hopefully be satisfied by the advanced part .",
    "we only give very selected proofs , and we often prefer to introduce concepts via examples in order to be selfcontained and elementary .    the general main theme of this article is the interplay between algebra and geometry .",
    "sometimes algebra helps to understand the geometry of certain objects and vice versa .",
    "the absolute galois group , i.e. , the group of field automorphisms of the algebraic closure of @xmath0 , which is a basic object of interest in algebraic number theory , is still very mysterious and since grothendieck s proposal of `` dessins denfants '' people try to understand it via suitable actions on classes of geometrical objects .    in this paper",
    "we address the simplest possible such action , namely the action of the absolute galois group on the space of ( normalized ) polynomials with exactly two critical values , and on some combinatorial objects related to them .    at the basis of such a correspondence",
    "lies the so called `` algebraization '' of ( non constant ) holomorphic functions @xmath1 from a compact riemann surface @xmath2 to the projective line : the riemann existence theorem describes @xmath3 completely through its set of critical values and the related monodromy homomorphism ( the combinatorial object mentioned above ) .",
    "the class of polynomials with two critical values is far from being understood , there are however two series of such polynomials , the so called chebycheff polynomials , and the belyi polynomials .    while the latter have a very simple algebraic description but are not so well known , the chebycheff polynomials are ubiquitous in many fields of mathematics ( probability , harmonic analysis , .. ) and everybody has encountered them some time ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we try to describe the chebycheff polynomials from a geometric point of view , explaining its geometrical ties with the function @xmath4 , which also has exactly two critical values ( viz . , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the group of symmetries for @xmath6 is the infinite dihedral group of transformations @xmath7 , which has as fundamental domain an euclidean triangle of type @xmath8 , i.e. , with angles @xmath9 .",
    "our complete mastering of the function @xmath6 allows us to achieve a complete and satisfactory description of the polynomials with finite dihedral symmetry , namely the chebycheff polynomials .",
    "this is a key idea for the program we address : the knowledge of the uniformizing triangular functions in the hyperbolic case ( these are functions on the upper half plane , with group of symmetries determined by a hyperbolic triangle with angles @xmath10 , cf .",
    "@xcite , part @xmath11 , chapter @xmath12 ) sheds light on the class of the so called _ triangle curves _ , on which the absolute galois group acts .",
    "triangle curves are pairs @xmath13 of a curve @xmath2 and a holomorphic galois covering map @xmath14 ramified exactly over @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , being ramified only in three points , triangle curves are _ rigid _",
    "( i.e. , they do not have any non trivial deformations ) hence they are defined over @xmath16 .",
    "belyi s famous theorem says almost the converse : every curve defined over @xmath16 admits a holomorphic map @xmath14 ramified exactly over @xmath15 .",
    "belyi s theorem in turn aroused the interest of grothendieck to the possible application of this result to the construction of interesting representations of the absolute galois group , on the set of the so called `` dessins denfants '' , which we briefly describe in section @xmath17 .",
    "our main purpose is to explain how grothendieck s sets of `` dessins denfants '' can be more conveniently replaced by the sets of fundamental groups of certain higher dimensional varieties @xmath18 which admit an unramified covering which is isomorphic to a product of curves ( these are called _ varieties isogenous to a product _ ) .",
    "the galois group acts transforming such a variety @xmath18 to another variety of the same type , but whose fundamental group need not be isomorphic to the fundamental group of @xmath18 .    the last chapter is thus devoted to an overview of @xcite , where the so - called _ beauville surfaces _ are studied .",
    "beauville surfaces are rigid surfaces which admit a finite unramified covering which is a product of two algebraic curves .",
    "giving a beauville surface is essentially equivalent to giving two triangle curves with the same group @xmath19 , and in such a way that @xmath19 acts freely on the product of the two triangle curves .",
    "beauville surfaces ( and their higher dimensional analogues ) not only provide a wide class of surfaces quite manageable in order to test conjectures , but also show how close algebra and geometry are .",
    "the ease with which one can handle these surfaces is based on the fact that they are determined by discrete combinatorial data .",
    "therefore one can translate existence problems , geometric properties etc . in a purely group theoretic language .",
    "it was very fascinating for us that , studying beauville surfaces , we found out that many geometric questions are closely related to some classical problems and conjectures in the theory of finite groups .",
    "let @xmath20 be any field and let @xmath21 be an automorphism of @xmath20 : then , since @xmath22 , it follows that @xmath23 , therefore @xmath24 for all @xmath25 . if @xmath20 has characteristic @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , thus @xmath29 , then @xmath30 .",

    "\\2 ) this follows from the fact that , if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two transcendency bases , i.e. , maximal subsets of elements satisfying no nontrivial polynomial equations , then @xmath37 and @xmath38 have the same cardinality @xmath39 , and for any bijection @xmath40 between @xmath37 and @xmath38 there exists an automorphism @xmath34 such that @xmath41 .",

    "\\ p ( z ) = 0 \\}$ ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath47 is so large is due to the fact that the kernel of @xmath48 is very large .",
    "the group @xmath49 is called the _ absolute galois group _ and denoted by @xmath50 .    note that even if we have a presentation of a group @xmath19 , still our information about it might be quite scarce ( even the question : `` is the group nontrivial ? ''",
    "is hard to answer ) , and the solution is to have a _ representation _ of it , for instance , an action on a set @xmath51 that can be very well described .",
    "the dihedral group @xmath52 is best described through its action on @xmath43 , as the set of @xmath53 transformations of the form @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , or of the form @xmath56 .",
    "we see immediately that the group acts as a group of permutations of the regular @xmath57gon whose set of vertices is the set @xmath58 of @xmath57th roots of unity @xmath59 .",
    "the group is generated by complex conjugation @xmath44 , and by the rotation @xmath60 , so its presentation is @xmath61 .",
    "we end the section by invoking _",
    "grothendieck s dream of dessins d enfants (= children s drawings ) _ , which aims at finding concrete representations for the galois group @xmath62 . we will try to explain some of the basic ideas in the next sections , trying to be as elementary as possible .",
    "one can invoke as a catchword _ moduli theory _",

    "inspired by a construction of a. beauville ( cf @xcite ) of a surface with @xmath350 , @xmath351 as a quotient of the product of two fermat curves of degree @xmath179 by the action of @xmath352 the second author gave in @xcite the following definition .          in the above cited paper , the second author introduced and studied extensively surfaces isogenous to a higher product . among others",
    "it is shown there that the topology of a surface isogenous to a product determines its deformation class up to complex conjugation .",

    "the corresponding subset of the moduli space @xmath356 , corresponding to surfaces homeomorhphic , resp , diffeomorphic to @xmath353 , is either irreducible and connected or it contains two connected components which are exchanged by complex conjugation .",
    "the class of surfaces isogenous to a product and their higher dimensional analogues provide a wide class of examples where one can test or disprove several conjectures and questions ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    notice , that given a surface @xmath354 isogenous to a product , we obtain always three more , exchanging @xmath358 with its conjugate curve @xmath359 , or @xmath360 with @xmath361 , but only if we conjugate both @xmath358 and @xmath360 , we obtain an orientedly diffeomorphic surface .",
    "however , these four surfaces could be all biholomorphic to each other .",
    "if @xmath353 is a beauville surface ( and @xmath18 is orientedly diffeomorphic to @xmath353 ) this implies : @xmath362 or @xmath363 . in other words , the corresponding subset of the moduli space @xmath364 consists of one or two points ( if we insist on keeping the orientation fixed , else we may get up to four points ) .",
    "the interest for beauville surfaces comes from the fact that they are the rigid ones amongst surfaces isogenous to a product .",
    "we recall that an algebraic variety @xmath18 is _ rigid _ if and only if it does not have any non trivial deformation ( for instance , the projective space is rigid ) .",
    "there is another ( stronger ) notion of rigidity , which is the following          these varieties are of general type and the moduli space of varieties of general type is defined over @xmath365 , and naturally the absolute galois group @xmath366 acts on the set of their connected components .",
    "so , in our special case , @xmath366 acts on the isolated points which parametrize rigid varieties .    in particular , rigid varieties are defined over a number field and work of shimura gives in special cases a way of computing explicitly their fields of definition . by this reason",
    "these varieties were named _ shimura varieties _",

    "the rigidity of a beauville surface is equivalent to the condition that @xmath367 is a triangle curve , for @xmath368 ( @xmath369 is the subgroup of index @xmath370 which does not exchange the two factors ) .      by the previous theorem ,",

    "donaldson s breaktrough results had made clear that diffeomorphism and homeomorphism differ drastically for algebraic surfaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the success of gauge theory led friedman and morgan to `` speculate '' that the diffeomorphism type of algebraic surfaces determines the deformation class .",
    "after the first counterexamples of m. manetti ( cf .",

    "@xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the counterexamples are of quite different nature : manetti used @xmath377-covers of @xmath378 , his surfaces have @xmath379 , but are not @xmath171-connected .",
    "kharlamov - kulikov used quotients @xmath353 of the unit ball in @xmath380 , thus @xmath381 , and the surfaces are rigid .",
    "catanese used surfaces isogenous to a product ( which are not rigid ) .",
    "our examples are given by beauville surfaces .",
    "the great advantage of these is that , being isogenous to a product , they can be described by combinatorial data and the geometry of these surfaces is encoded in the algebraic data of a finite group .",

    "the datum of a beauville surface can be completely described group theoretically , since it is equivalent to the datum of two triangle curves with isomorphic groups with some additional condition assuring that the diagonal action on the product of the two curves is free .",
