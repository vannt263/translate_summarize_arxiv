    "in this work we analyze the stochastically forced boussinesq equations for the velocity field @xmath0 , ( density - normalized ) pressure @xmath1 , and temperature @xmath2 of a viscous incompressible fluid .",
    "these equations take the form @xmath3 where the parameters @xmath4 are respectively the kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the fluid and @xmath5 with @xmath6 is the product of the gravitational constant and the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "the spatial variable @xmath7 belongs to a two - dimensional torus @xmath8 .",
    "that is , we impose periodic boundary conditions in space .",
    "we consider a degenerate stochastic forcing @xmath9 , which acts only on a few fourier modes and exclusively through the temperature equation .",
    "we prove that there exists a unique statistically invariant state of the system . more precisely , we establish :    [ thm : main : res ] with white noise acting only on the two largest standard modes of the temperature equation , @xmath10 the markov semigroup corresponding to  possesses a unique ergodic invariant measure .",
    "moreover this measure is mixing , and it obeys a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem .",
    "the interaction between the nonlinear and stochastic terms in  is delicate , and leads us to develop a novel infinite - dimensional form of the hrmander bracket condition . our analysis generalizes techniques developed in the recent works @xcite , and we believe it has broader interest for systems of spdes .",
    "going back to the early 1900 s rayleigh @xcite proposed the study of buoyancy driven fluid convection problems using the equations of boussinesq @xcite in order to explain the experimental work of bnard @xcite .",
    "today this system of equations plays a fundamental role in a wide variety of physical settings including climate and weather , the study of plate tectonics , and the internal dynamical structure of stars , see e.g. @xcite and references therein for further background",
    ".    physically speaking , the system  ( with @xmath11 ) arises as follows .",
    "consider a fluid with velocity @xmath12 confined between two horizontal plates , where one fixes the temperature @xmath2 of the fluid on the top @xmath13 , and bottom @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( i.e. heating from below ) .",
    "it is typical to assume a linear relationship between density and temperature , and to impose the boussinesq approximation , which posits that the only significant role played by density variations in the fluid arise through the gravitational terms , so that the fluid velocity @xmath12 and temperature @xmath2 evolve according to . due to the presence of viscosity , the fluid is not moving at the plates and one assumes no - slip boundary conditions @xmath16 .",
    "the form of the boussinesq equations we consider in this work , that is  supplemented with periodic boundary conditions , is sometimes referred to in the physics community as the ` homogeneous rayleigh - bnard ' or ` hrb ' system .",
    "it is derived as follows : one transforms the governing equations we have just described into an equivalent homogenous system by subtracting off a linear temperature profile .",
    "this introduces an additional excitation term in the temperature equation , and makes the temperature vanish at the plates . as a numerical simplification ,",
    "one then replaces these boundary conditions with periodic ones ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this periodic setting is controversial in the physics community since it can produce unbounded ( ` grow - up ' ) solutions , as has been observed both numerically and through explicit solutions , @xcite .",
    "we will consider  in situations with _ no temperature differential _",
    "( @xmath17 , i.e. zero rayleigh number ) , so that the additional excitation term is not present and such unbounded solutions do not exist . extensions to more physically realistic boundary conditions for  will be addressed in forthcoming works .    in the mathematical community",
    "the deterministic boussinesq equations with various boundary conditions on bounded and unbounded domains have attracted considerable attention . in one line of work the 2d system has been interpreted as an analogue of 3d axisymmetric flow where ` vortex stretching ' terms appear in the ` vorticity formulation ' , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "other authors have sought to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for various physical and numerical observations in fluid convection problems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us briefly motivate the stochastic forcing appearing in . due to sensitivity with respect to initial data and parameters , individual solutions of the basic equations of fluid mechanics are unpredictable and seemingly chaotic . however , some of their statistical properties of solutions are robust . as early as the 19th century j.v .",
    "boussinesq conjectured that turbulent flow can not be solely described by deterministic methods , and indicated that a stochastic framework should be used , see @xcite .",
    "more recently the study of the navier - stokes equations with degenerate white noise forcing has been proposed a proxy for the large - scale ` generic ' stirring which is assumed in the basic theories of turbulence ; this setting is ubiquitous in the turbulence literature , see e.g. @xcite and containing references .",
    "in this view , invariant measures of the stochastic equations of fluid dynamics would presumably contain the statistics posited by these theories .",
    "the closely related question of unique ergodicity and mixing provides rigorous justification for the explicit and implicit measurement assumptions invoked by physicists and engineers when measuring statistical properties of turbulent systems .",
    "the existence of invariant measures for forced - dissipative systems is often easy to prove with classical tools , namely by making use of the krylov - bogoliubov averaging procedure with energy ( compactness ) estimates , but the uniqueness of these measures is a deep and subtle issue . to establish this uniqueness",
    "one can follow the path laid out by the doob - khasminskii theorem @xcite , and more recently expanded upon in @xcite .",
    "this strategy requires the proof of certain smoothing properties of the associated markov semigroup , and to show that a common state can be reached by the dynamics regardless of initial conditions ( irreducibility ) . without stochastic forcing , solutions of our system converge to the trivial equilibrium , so that the proof of irreducibility is straightforward in our context .",
    "thus the main challenge of this work is to establish sufficient smoothing properties for the markov semigroup associated to .      in order to discuss the difficulties in establishing smoothing properties for the markov semigroup it is useful to recall the canonical relationship between stochastic evolution equations and their corresponding fokker - planck ( kolmogorov ) equations . consider an abstract equation on a hilbert space @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a ( finite or infinite ) collection of independent 1d brownian motions .",
    "we denote solutions @xmath22 with the initial condition @xmath23 at time @xmath24 by @xmath25 , and define the markov semigroup associated to according to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is any ` observable ' .",
    "then @xmath28 solves the fokker - planck equation corresponding to given by @xmath29 + \\langle f(u ) , d\\psi \\rangle , \\quad \\psi(0 ) : = { \\phi}\\label{eq : fokk : er : plank }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we view @xmath30 as an element in @xmath31 .",
    "the interested reader should consult @xcite for more on the general theory of second order pdes posed on a hilbert space .",
    "there is a wide literature devoted to proving uniqueness and associated mixing properties of invariant measures for nonlinear stochastic pdes when @xmath32 is non - degenerate or mildly degenerate .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein",
    ". roughly speaking ,",
    "the fewer the number of driving stochastic terms in , the more degenerate the diffusion in , and the more difficult it becomes to establish smoothing properties for the markov semigroup @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , while even the non - degenerate setting poses many interesting mathematical challenges , such stochastic forcing regimes are highly unsatisfactory from the point of view of turbulence where one typically assumes a clear separation between the forced and dissipative scales of motion .    going back to the seminal work of hrmander @xcite ( and cf .",
    "@xcite ) , a theory of parabolic regularity for finite dimensional pdes of the general form with degenerate diffusion terms was developed .",
    "this theory of ` hypoellipticity ' can be interpreted in terms of finite - dimensional stochastic odes for which these degenerate parabolic pdes are the corresponding kolmogorov equations .",
    "this connection suggested the potential for a more probabilistic approach , initiating the development of the so - called malliavin calculus ; see @xcite and subsequent authors @xcite . in any case , the work of hrmander and malliavin has led to an extensive theory of unique ergodicity and mixing properties for finite - dimensional stochastic odes .    by comparison , for stochastic pdes ( which correspond to the situation when is posed on an infinite dimensional space )",
    "this theory of hypoellipticity remains in its infancy .",
    "recently , however , in a series of groundbreaking works @xcite , a theory of unique ergodicity for degenerately forced infinite - dimensional stochastic systems has emerged .",
    "these works produced two fundamental contributions : firstly the authors demonstrated that to establish the uniqueness of the invariant measure it suffices to prove time asymptotic smoothing ( asymptotic strong feller property ) instead of ` instantaneous ' smoothing ( strong feller property ) .",
    "this is an abstract result from probability and it applies to very general settings including ours .",
    "secondly the authors generalize the methods of malliavin ( and subsequent authors ) in order to prove the asymptotic strong feller property for certain infinite - dimensional stochastic systems .",
    "these works resulted in an infinite - dimensional analogue of the hrmander bracket condition .",
    "for the second point the application of the methods in @xcite is more delicate and must be considered on a case - by - case basis ; it requires a careful analysis of the interaction of the nonlinear and stochastic terms of the system .",
    "in our situation the bracket condition in @xcite is not satisfied and needs to be replaced by a weaker notion .",
    "this required us to rework and generalize many basic elements of their approach .",
    "to explain our contributions at a more technical level , let us recall what is meant by a ` hrmander bracket condition ' in the context of systems of the general form .",
    "define @xmath34 and for @xmath35 take @xmath36 , [ e , \\sigma_k ] , e : e \\in \\mathcal{v}_{m-1 } , k = 1 , \\ldots , d\\ } \\",

    "\\label{eq : lie : brak : abs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this operation @xmath40 $ ] is referred to as the _ lie bracket _ of the two ` vector fields ' @xmath41 . in finite dimensions , that is when",
    "@xmath42 , the classical hrmander condition is satisfied if @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "this condition is not suitable for infinite - dimensional settings since the effect of randomness from the directly forced modes seems to weaken as it propagates out in infinite dimensional space . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , due to contractive properties of the flow on high modes , it is enough to require that the lie brackets span all the unstable directions of the system .",
    "more precisely , the following non - degeneracy assumption is required : for every @xmath45 , there is an @xmath46 and a finite set @xmath47 such that the quadratic form @xmath48 satisfies , for each @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath22 solves - , @xmath51 is a constant independent of @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is a sequence of projection operators onto successively larger spaces .",
    "might dependent on @xmath22 ( subject to suitable moment bounds ) but they require that @xmath54 be almost everywhere positive which is _ not _ sufficient for our purposes . ]",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that for many equations with polynomial nonlinearities brackets of the type @xmath55 , \\cdots ] , \\sigma_{k_m}]$ ] ( where @xmath56 are previously generated constant vector fields ) suffice to build quadratic forms satisfying .",
    "indeed , this approach has now been successfully employed for several important examples , including the 2d and 3d navier - stokes equations and the ginzburg - landau equations ; see @xcite . in these works",
    "algebraic conditions on the set of stochastically forced modes have been derived which guarantee that any finite - dimensional space @xmath57 can be generated from these types of brackets ; one obtains a collection of @xmath22-independent elements @xmath58 which form an orthonormal basis for @xmath57 .",
    "this strategy has proven effective for certain scalar equations , but its limitations are evident in slightly more complicated situations .",
    "we believe that  provides an illuminating case study of these difficulties which has lead us to generalize .",
    "observe that our model is distinguished by two key structural properties .",
    "firstly , the buoyancy term @xmath59 is the only means of spreading the effect of the stochastic forcing from the temperature equation , , to the momentum equations , . in particular note that this buoyancy term is linear , and therefore vanishes after two lie bracket operations with constant vector fields .",
    "secondly , the advective structure in  leads to a delicate ` asymmetry ' in the nonlinear terms .",
    "for example this means that a more refined analysis is needed to address the spread of noise in the temperature equation alone .",
    "is the only second order term in the temperature equation . ]",
    "concretely we find that , by combining these observations , one obtains @xmath60,\\sigma_{k_2 } ] = 0 $ ] for any constant vector fields @xmath61 concentrated in the temperature component of the phase space . in view of these discussions",
    "it is worth emphasizing that our chosen forcing - that is , noise acting only through the temperature equations - is the most interesting situation to consider from the point of view of ergodicity .    to get around these difficulties we make careful use of the interaction between the nonlinear , buoyancy and noise terms in  as follows : we see that noise activated through the temperature equation is spread to the momentum equations .",
    "it is then advected in the temperature equations and combines again with the noise terms to produce new directions in the temperature component of the phase space .",
    "these loose observations find concrete expressions in a series of lie brackets of the form @xmath62 , f ] , \\sigma_{k_2}]$ ] for constant vector fields @xmath63 and @xmath64 which belong to the @xmath2-component .",
    "remarkably , we found that this chain of admissible brackets leads to new constant vector fields exclusively in the @xmath2-component of the phase space .",
    "this surprising observation requires a series of detailed computations but is perhaps anticipated by the advective structure of the nonlinear terms .",
    "it is in addressing the spread of noise in the momentum components of the phase space that the condition breaks down .",
    "forced directions in the temperature component are pushed to the momentum components through the buoyancy term . however , due to the presence of the nonlinearity , they are ` mixed ' with terms which have an unavoidable and complicated directional ( non - frequency - localized ) dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "crucially , due to the advective structure in  , these ` error terms ' are concentrated only in the temperature component of the phase space .",
    "we are therefore able to push these error terms to small scales by using the ` pure ' @xmath2 directions already generated ( following the procedure described in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "more precisely , in the language of , , we are able to show that for every @xmath65 we can find @xmath66 and sets @xmath47 consisting of elements of the form @xmath67 , where the sequence @xmath68 ( which are essentially vectors consisting of trigonometric functions ) forms an orthonormal basis for the phase space and @xmath69 are functions taking values in @xmath18 with a complicated dependence on @xmath22 but which are supported on ` high ' frequencies , i.e. wavenumbers larger than @xmath70 .",
    "these structural observations for  lead us to formulate the following generalization of .",
    "[ def : our : cond ] let @xmath18 and @xmath71 be hilbert spaces with @xmath71 compactly embedded in @xmath18 .",

    "below we demonstrate that the condition is sufficient to establish suitable time asymptotic smoothing properties for the markov semigroup associated to could be shown to hold in a more general setting with essentially the same analysis . ]",
    "this allows us to apply the abstract results from @xcite to complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main : res ] .",
    "the main technical challenge arising from the modified condition is that it requires us to significantly rework the spectral analysis of the malliavin matrix appearing in @xcite .",
    "the technically oriented reader can skip immediately to section [ sec : mal : spec : bnds ] for further details .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : math : setting ] we restate our problem in an abstract functional setting and introduce some general definitions and notations",
    ". then we reduce the question of uniqueness of the invariant measure to establishing a time asymptotic gradient estimate on the markov semigroup .",
    "next , in section  [ sec : grad : control ] we explain how , using the machinery of malliavin calculus , this gradient bound reduces to a control problem for a linearization of . in turn we show that this control problem may be solved by establishing appropriate spectral bounds for the malliavin covariance matrix @xmath81 .",
    "section  [ sec : mal : spec : bnds ] is devoted to proving that our new form of the hrmander condition , , implies these spectral bounds , modulo some technical estimates postponed for section  [ sec : braket : est : mal : mat ] .",
    "section  [ sec : hormander : brak ] provides detailed lie bracket computations leading to the modified condition .",

    "appendices [ sec : moment : est ] and [ subsect : malliavin ] collect respectively statistical moment bounds for  ( and associated linearizations ) and a brief review of some elements of the malliavin calculus used in our analysis .",
    "in this section we formulate  as an abstract evolution equation on a hilbert space and define its associated markovian framework .",
    "then we formulate our main result in theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] and give an outline of the proof , which sets the agenda for the work below .    in the rest of the paper , we consider in the equivalent , vorticity formulation .",
