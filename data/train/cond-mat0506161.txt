    "a microscopic quantum many - body theory is mainly to study correlations between the constituent particles of a quantum system .",
    "one of the most successful quantum many - body theories is the method of correlated basis functionals ( cbf ) @xcite which includes real - space many - body correlation functions in the ground state and employs similar techniques as in classical statistical mechanics to calculate the corresponding distribution functions .",
    "the cbf has proved to be one of very few many - body theories capable of dealing with strongly correlated boson systems in liquid phase .",
    "another successful quantum many - body theory is the coupled - cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite in which excitation operators with respect to an uncorrelated model state are employed to construct the many - body correlations in an exponentiated operator factor in the ket ground - state .",
    "the distribution functions are not needed in the ccm as the hamiltonian expectation value is straightforwardly calculated as a finite order polynomial in terms of the correlation coefficients .",
    "this is because the bra ground - state in the ccm is not the hermitian conjugate of the ket ground - state but is in a simple , linear form @xcite .",
    "the ccm has proved to be one of most powerful techniques in calculating ground - state energy for many non - liquid fermion systems such as atoms , molecules and electron gas@xcite . however , a general many - body theory capable of dealing with strongly correlated fermion systems in liquid phase is still needed .    in our earlier papers @xcite , by an application to bipartite quantum antiferromagnetic lattice systems , we have extended the ccm to a variational formalism where , in contrast to the traditional ccm , the bra and ket ground - states are hermitian conjugate to one - another .",
    "two sets of the distribution functions were introduced to evaluate hamiltonian expectation .",
    "we developed an algebraic scheme to calculate these distribution functions through self - consistent sets of equations . in this paper , we present an alternative scheme based on diagrams to calculate these distribution functions . as in the cbf , a generating functional is introduced and calculated by a linked - cluster expansion in terms of diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are constructed according to a few simple rules and using only three basic elements : ( a ) dots representing the ket - state correlation coefficients , ( b ) exchange lines representing the bra - state correlation coefficients , and ( c ) pauli line representing pauli exclusion principle manifested by the spin-1/2 operator property @xmath0 in our spin model example . in this fashion",
    ", infinite diagrams can be resummed in a straightforward manner . as a simple application in our spin model , the spin - wave theory",
    "( swt)@xcite is reproduced by including all so - called ring diagrams without any pauli line .",
    "approximations beyond swt by resummations including pauli lines are also given .",
    "one such approximation , which includes all so - called super - ring diagrams by a resummation of infinite pauli lines in addition to resummations of ring diagrams , produces a convergent , precise result for the order - parameter of the one - dimensional isotropic model , contrast to the well - known divergence of swt .",
    "furthermore , the diagrammatic analysis discussed here forms a basis for a possible combination of the variational ccm and cbf . such a unified theory may prove to be capable of dealing with strongly - correlated fermion system in liquid phase .",
    "we take the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic xxz model on a bipartite lattice as our example .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the anisotropy constant , the index @xmath3 runs over all lattice sites , @xmath4 runs over all @xmath5 nearest - neighbour sites , and @xmath6 are the usual spin raising @xmath7 and lowering @xmath8 operators . as in our earlier work using the traditional ccm @xcite , we take the model state as the classical nel state with alternating spin - up and spin - down sublattices . as",
    "before , we shall exclusively use index @xmath9 for the spin - up sublattice and the index @xmath10 for the spin - down sublattice .",
    "the many - spin correlations in its ground state of eq .",
    "( 1 ) can then be included by considering the excited states with respect to the uncorrelated model state .",
    "these excited states are constructed by applying the so - called configuration creation operators @xmath11 to the nel model state with the nominal index @xmath12 labelling these operators . in our spin model , the operators @xmath11 are given by any combination of the spin - flip operators to the nel state @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; the index @xmath12 in this case corresponds to the collection of the lattice indices ( @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s ) .",
    "the hermitian conjugate operators of @xmath11 are the configuration destruction operator @xmath15 , given by any combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the two - spin flip creation operator is given by @xmath18 , and their destruction counterpart , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spin quantum number .",
    "although we are mainly interested in @xmath21 in this article , we keep the factor of @xmath22 for the purpose of comparison with the large-@xmath20 expansion .",
    "as discussed in details in our earlier paper @xcite , we use coester representation for both the ket and bra ground - states and write @xmath23 with @xmath24 for the ket state and the corresponding hermitian conjugate of eq .",
    "( 3 ) for the bra state , using notation @xmath25 for the bra - state coefficients .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 are then determined by the usual variational equations as @xmath27 we define the so - called bare distribution functions as @xmath28 where we have exchanged the definition of @xmath29 with that of @xmath30 as compared with those in ref .  7 for purely notational reason .",
    "the hamiltonian expectation @xmath31 is shown , in general , to be a function containing up to linear terms in @xmath29 and @xmath32 and finite order polynomial in @xmath33 ( or in @xmath34 ) in eq .",

    "@xmath35 two systematic schemes have been developed for calculating the distribution functions of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) : one is algeraic and the other is diagrammatic . in the algebraic approach , by taking the advantage of the properties of the operators , it is straightforward to derive the following self - consistent sets of equations for the distribution functions @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a function containing up to linear terms in @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) and finite order polynomial in @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) .",

    "( 4 ) are then carried to determined the optimum @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this algebraic calculation ,",
    "direct comparison with the traditional ccm can be made .",
    "it is shown that the ccm is a linear approximation to one set of distributions as simply @xmath42 , which is a poor approximation for the spin - spin correlation function and low - lying excitations .",
    "more detailed comparison was given in ref .",
    "we present the diagrammatic scheme similar to that in cbf to calculate these distribution functions .",
    "we like to point out that eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 4)-(7 ) are the main general equations of the variational ccm .",
    "in this section , we calculate the bare distribution functions @xmath29 and @xmath32 of eq .  ( 5 ) by employing a diagrammatic scheme . as a demonstration",
    ", we consider a simple truncation approximation in which the correlation operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 of eqs .",

    "( 5 ) . in this approximation , for example , the expectation value of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is calculated as @xmath51 @xmath52 is the usual full one - body distribution function defined as @xmath53 and where @xmath54 is the full two - body distribution function define as @xmath55 the order parameter is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , taking the advantage of translational invariance .",
    "we define a generating functional @xmath58 in the usual fashion as , @xmath59 so that the bare and full distribution functions can be simply expressed as functional derivatives of @xmath58 . for example",
    ", the one - body and two - body bare functions are given by @xmath60 where , for simplicity , we have employed notation @xmath61 so that @xmath62 etc . ; and the structure function @xmath63 has the usual relation as in the cbf as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , etc .",
    "we now write @xmath58 in terms of a linked - cluster expansion @xmath66 the main task of this section is to find a diagrammatic scheme to categorize this expansion .",
    "we first expand the ket - state operator in the simplified notation , @xmath67 , where in the last equation , the summation over all indices is understood .",
    "the normalization integral , @xmath68 can be evaluated straightforwardly for the first few terms . in the above series , the primed indices are used for bra state expansion .",
    "we notice that each term of eq .  ( 18 ) contains equal number of creation and destruction operators ( otherwise , the expectation is zero ) .",
    "the first - order expectation is easily calculated as @xmath69 .",
    "hence we have , writing out the summation explicitly , @xmath70 the calculation of the second - order expectation @xmath71 is slightly more complicated .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath72 ( i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "there are four nonzero terms @xmath75 the cases when @xmath76 and/or @xmath77 can be easily accounted for by introducing a factor involving the usual delta functions as , @xmath78 with a definition , @xmath79 this is because @xmath80 for @xmath21 , a manifestation of pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the second - order contribution is hence derived as @xmath81 \\left ( 1+\\delta _ { 12}\\right ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term inside the square brackets clearly represents the so - called exchange contributions .",
    "we notice that we did not consider explicitly the pauli exclusion principle for the bra - state operators in the above derivations as the delta functions for the ket state operators also take this principle into account due to the fact that each of the bra - state operators always need to match one of the ket - state operators in order to give nonzero contribution .",
    "this is also true for higher - order terms .",
    "we also notice the expression of eq .",
    "( 20 ) is in fact also correct for spin quantum number @xmath82 because , for a general @xmath20 , @xmath83 etc . for higher - order terms in the expansion of eq .  (",
    "18 ) , the extension of pauli exclusion principle can be simply written as a product of two - body factors as @xmath84 we notice that the above product in general is not exact any more but an approximation for @xmath82 as the three - body effects ( e.g. , from @xmath85 when @xmath86 ) have been ignored .    in order to extend to higher - order calculations including the exchange contributions , we need a systematic graph representation .",
    "for this purpose , as shown in fig .  1 , we use a solid dot to represent the ket state coefficient @xmath87 with @xmath88 as defined earlier ; a ( directed ) exchange line drawing from @xmath89 to @xmath90 to represent the bra state coefficient @xmath91 ; and a pauli ( dashed ) line drawing between any two dots to represent delta function @xmath92 of eq .",
    "( 20 ) . with these graphic notations ,",
    "a linked contribution is represented by a connected diagram . after the detailed calculations up to 5th order , we have established the following simple and complete rules for construction of these diagrams in the normalization integral of eq .  ( 18 ) :    * the @xmath93th - order contribution consists of all possible diagrams involving @xmath93 dots ; * in each diagram the number of dots equal to number of exchange lines ; * a dot is always connected by exchange lines ( leaving and coming ) hence exchange lines always form loops ; * between any pair of dots one can draw at most one pauli line ; * the contribution of each diagram is divided by its symmetry factor ; * summations over all indices involved .",
    "we first consider the case without any pauli line , @xmath94 .",
    "( this is equivalent to turning spin operators to boson operators as will be shown later . ) for example , the first - order contribution of eq .  ( 19 ) is simply a dot with an exchange line leaving and coming as shown as diagram @xmath95 in fig .  2 , where the direction of exchange line is clockwise as in most other diagrams ( we therefore do not show arrows of exchange lines explicitly ) .",
    "the second - order contribution with @xmath96 is given by two diagrams @xmath97 and @xmath98 in fig .",
    "2 , namely @xmath99 .",
    "the 3rd - order contribution is calculated as @xmath100 and is shown in fig .  3 , where factor @xmath101 for diagram @xmath97 is due to the three equivalent diagrams by rotation and the factor @xmath102 for diagram @xmath98 comes from the two equivalent diagram with opposite directions , one clockwise the other counter - clockwise ( this is referred to as parity symmetry ) . in",
    "similar fashion one can write down the 4th - order contribution as shown in fig .  4 for the corresponding diagrams as @xmath103 where the coefficient numbers are the symmetry factors of the corresponding diagrams .",
    "for example , the factor @xmath104 for diagram @xmath105 is due to the fact that there are three equivalent diagrams each with parity symmetry factor of @xmath102 .",
    "the 5th - order contributions include 7 independent diagrams , as shown in fig .  5 ,",
    "namely @xmath106 we notice that , in all these results , the last term represents a ring diagram with @xmath93 dots in the @xmath93th order contribution .",
    "we use @xmath107 to represent this ring diagram with the symmetry factor @xmath108 .",
    "for example , the 4th - order ring contribution is , writing out the summations explicitly @xmath109 furthermore , the other terms in these @xmath93-order contributions are simply a product of smaller ring contributions .",
    "this property can be extended to higher order .",
    "( for this purpose one needs to apply symmetric group @xmath110 to count the number of diagrams .",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "we are now in position to write all contributions without any pauli line in terms of these ring diagrams .",
    "the normalization integral of eq .",
    "( 18 ) is then written as @xmath111 the corresponding generating functional @xmath112 without any pauli line is simply @xmath113    to include pauli lines ( i.e. @xmath114 ) , we use notation @xmath115 to represents the contribution of all linked @xmath93-clusters and write @xmath116 using the simple rules discussed earlier , without much difficulty , we can list all @xmath93-cluster contributions of @xmath115 in terms of a ring diagram @xmath107 plus all possible ways of drawing pauli lines between any pair of @xmath93 dots of rings , including those pairs of dots between rings and those pairs of dots inside rings . in fig .",
    "6 we list all 3rd - order contributions in @xmath117 except @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we first consider all diagrams without any pauli line , namely all the ring diagram contributions @xmath107 with @xmath120 , and show that the spin - wave theory is thus reproduced . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 20 ) , these ring diagrams represent the first order approximation in the large-@xmath20 limit .",
    "in fact , in this limit , operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 behave like bosons as @xmath123 , @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction by eq .",
    "( 8) becomes the spin - wave function as @xmath125 where the nel state @xmath126 should be considered as the vacuum state for the two sets of bosons @xmath127 and @xmath128 and where , in the last equation , we have made fourier transformations using the translational symmetry as , @xmath129 with summation over @xmath130 restricted to the magnetic zone . the normalization integral of eq .",
    "( 27 ) can be easily calculated as the wavefunction is uncoupled in @xmath131-space .",

( 36 ) ( without the common @xmath87 factor ) agrees with the expression @xmath154 of swt in ref .  9 and with eq .  ( 31 ) of our earlier paper ref .  7 ( after changing the sign of both 5th and 6th terms in the equation as they were typos ) . after summing over index @xmath155 with @xmath156",
    ", we have , using eq .",
    "( 20 ) for @xmath157 , @xmath158 for @xmath21 and isotropic point @xmath146 , we obtain @xmath159 for the square lattice and @xmath160 for the cubic lattice .",
    "they are smaller than @xmath161 and @xmath162 of swt respectively .",
    "this is not surprising because swt is known to have over estimated the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the best numerical values for the square lattice vary from @xmath163 to @xmath164 , including results from extrapolation of high - order localized ccm calculations @xcite . for the 1d isotropic model",
    ", however , @xmath165 of eq .  ( 37 ) diverges as @xmath143 diverges as mentioned earlier .",
    "we next consider an approximation involving higher - order pauli lines by including all higher - order diagrams similar to that of eq .",
    "( 36 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "this infinite series can again be resummed in a closed form as a self - consistency equation , equivalent to replacing @xmath166 in eq .",
    "( 36 ) by @xmath167 itself as @xmath168 the resummation in eq .",
    "( 38 ) is similar to the resummation of rings in eqs .",
    "( 31)-(32 ) , we therefore refer it as super - ring resummation .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath165 thus obtained at the isotropic point for high dimensions improve slightly , as @xmath169 for the square lattice and @xmath170 for the cubic lattice .",
    "however , for the 1d isotropic model , eq .  ( 38 ) produces a convergent , precise number @xmath171 .",
    "this is interesting indeed , as the divergence of swt has troubled theorists for many years .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the traditional ccm sub2 approximation @xcite also produced a convergent result for the 1d model but at @xmath172 , not at the isotropic point @xmath146 .",
    "we leave more discussion to the following section , and leave detailed calculations including other higher - order terms and resummations in two - body function @xmath173 and structure function @xmath63 of eq .",
    "( 16 ) somewhere else .",
    "in this article , we present a diagrammatic scheme for the calculations of distribution functions of the variational ccm , as an alternative to the algebraic scheme published in our earlier papers @xcite . the results of swt are reproduced by an approximation which resums all ring diagrams without any pauli line . approximations beyond swt can also easily be made by including diagrams with pauli lines .",
    "one such approximation , which includes all super - ring diagrams by a resummation of infinite pauli lines in addition to resummations of all ring diagrams , produces a convergent , precise number for the order parameter of the 1d isotropic model , contrast to the divergence of swt .",
    "this cure of swt divergence is also interesting to 2d models ( including square and triangle lattices ) as naive higher - order calculations within the framework of swt are also likely to produce divergent results , despite the fact that the first order results are reasonable .",
    "we believe that similar resummations of super - ring diagrams as fig .  9 and eq .",
    "( 38 ) may provide a solution for such divergent problems .",
    "we leave more detailed calculations to somewhere else .",
    "it is also possible to include in the ground state higher - order many - body correlations such as 4-spin - flip operators , in additional to the 2-spin - flip operators of eqs .",
    "( 8) . furthermore ,",
    "as demonstrated here by the diagrammatic approach , a direct link between our variational ccm and the powerful cbf has now been established , as both rely on determination of distribution functions through functional derivatives of a generating functional . in particular , as given by eq .",
    "( 13 ) , particle density @xmath165 in cbf is equivalent to the order parameter of our spin models as @xmath174 .",
    "its diagrammatic expansions in two theories are similar ( see chap .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "12 and ref .  13 for more cbf details ) . for 2d and 3d lattice models ,",
    "the values of density @xmath165 are small compared with @xmath20 .",
    "such spin systems can therefore be described as dilute gases ( dilute gases of quasiparticle magnons of spin waves ) . for the isotropic 1d model , density @xmath165",
    "is _ saturated _ , corresponding to the order parameter equal to zero , a critical value . our approximation including a resummation of super - ring diagrams is capable of reproducing precisely such number .",
    "it is also interesting to know that our diagrammatic analysis of the variational ccm is for the translational invariance lattice system while similar analysis in cbf is for inhomogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "clearly , for more accurate results in general , we need to include correlations between those quasiparticles in our ground state , and the cbf is well known to be one of most effective theories for dealing with such particle correlations ( even when they are very strong as in a helium-4 quantum liquid @xcite ) by systematic calculations of the important two - body distribution functions . we therefore propose a unified trial wavefunction @xmath175 as , including a generalized jastrow correlation operator @xmath176 involving quasiparticle density operator @xmath177 , @xmath178 where @xmath179 are the new additional variational parameters and @xmath180 is our variational ccm state of eq .",
    "the diagrammatic scheme as discussed in this article is useful for calculating the expansion of the new generating functional of eq .",
    "we have made progress in such calculations and wish to report results soon .",
    "we also believe such a unified many - body theory may prove to be capable of dealing with strongly correlated fermion systems in general .",

    "<S> similar to the method of correlated - basis functionals ( cbf ) , a generating functional is introduced and calculated by a linked - cluster expansion in terms of diagrams which are categorized and constructed according to a few simple rules and using correlation coefficients and pauli exclusion principle ( or pauli line ) as basic elements . </S>",
    "<S> infinite resummations of diagrams can then be done in a straightforward manner . </S>",
    "<S> one such resummation , which includes all so - called ring diagrams and ignores pauli exclusion principle , reproduces spin - wave theory ( swt ) . </S>",
    "<S> approximations beyond swt are also given . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , one such approximation including all so - called super - ring diagrams by a resummation of infinite pauli lines in additional to resummations of ring diagrams produces a convergent , precise number for the order - parameter of the one - dimensional isotropic model , contrast to the well - known divergence of swt . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the direct relation between our variational ccm and cbf and discuss a possible unification of the two theories . </S>"
