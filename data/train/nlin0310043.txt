    "recent theoretical developments and improved experimental techniques has led to growing interest in the phenomenon of localization of energy by nonlinearity in anharmonic lattices . the existence and properties of these intrinsic localized modes , known as discrete breathers ,",
    "have been subject of an much investigation ( see , e.g @xcite for a number of recent reviews of this topic ) . at present ,",
    "discrete breathers in classical systems is a relatively well understood phenomenon , but knowledge of the quantum equivalent of discrete breathers is not very developed . in particular",
    "we restrict ourselves to a study of small lattices and a small number of quanta where some numerically exact solutions can be found .",
    "although of less interest to the study of bulk matter , such studies are relevant to the recent developments in quantum nanotechnology and applications in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the quantum equivalent of a discrete breather in a translationally invariant anharmonic lattice is an extended bloch state with two or more particles in a strongly correlated state .",
    "there exist some theoretical results ( i.e.  @xcite ) , and some experimental observations of these states in different quantum systems , as mixtures of 4methyl  pyridine @xcite , in cu benzoates @xcite , and in doped alkalihalides @xcite .    here",
    "we present some results on a quantum one  dimensional lattice problem with a small number of quanta .",
    "we study a periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites containing fermions , described by an attractive fermionic hubbard model ( fh ) with two kinds of particles with opposite spins .",
    "it is a model of interest in connection with the theory of high-@xmath1 superconductivity @xcite , and it can be used to describe bound states of electron and holes in some nanostructures as nanorings ( excitons ) @xcite .",
    "many of the results could be extended to a great variety of systems , i.e. , we have obtained similar results with a periodic lattice containing bosons and described by the quantum discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the model , and in section 3 we study the existence of breathers in the simplest nontrivial case . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider some modifications that break the translational symmetry of the lattice , and can localize the breather in the lattice . in section 5 we extend the previous results , obtained in the simplest nontrivial case , to more complicated situations .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider an anharmonic lattice with @xmath0 sites and two kinds of fermions with opposite spins described by an attractive fermionic hubbard model ( fh ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are raising ( lowering ) operators for different electronic spin states , satisfying the standard fermionic anticommutation relations .",
    "the parameter ratio @xmath5 represent the ratios of anharmonicity to nearest  neighbor , hopping energy , and @xmath6 is the ratio of the effective mass of one type of fermion to the other . to eliminate the effects related to the finite size of the chain , we consider periodic boundary conditions and , initially , a translational invariant lattice , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , independent of @xmath9 . in general",
    "we consider @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham_fer ] ) conserves the number of quanta @xmath11 , and it is possible to apply the number  state  method to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian operator @xcite .",
    "we use a number  state ",
    "basis @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) represents the number of quanta of fermions @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) at site @xmath16 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "a general wave function is @xmath20 . as a first step ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to study the simplest nontrivial case @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and as a second step we consider more complicated situations with a small number of quanta , although many of the results are valid for larger values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the bound states correspond to exciton states , localized electron / hole states that may appear in nanorings .",
    "in a homogeneous quantum lattice with periodic boundary conditions , it is possible to block  diagonalize the hamiltonian operator using eigenfunctions of the translation operator @xmath25 defined as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . in each block ,",
    "the eigenfunctions have a fixed value of the momentum @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being an eigenvalue of the translation operator @xcite . in this way , it is possible to calculate the dispersion relation @xmath30 with a minimal computational effort .",
    "the corresponding matrix in the case @xmath31 is @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .    in this simplest non  trivial case ,",
    "if the anharmonicity parameter is large enough , as fig [ fig1 ] shows , there exists an isolated eigenvalue for each @xmath28 which corresponds to a localized eigenfunction , in the sense that there is a high probability for finding the two quanta at the same site .",
    "but due to the translational invariance of the system , there is an equal probability for finding these two quanta at any site of the system . in these cases ,",
    "some analytical expressions can be obtained in some asymptotic limits ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "note that , qualitatively , the existence of this localized state is independent of the value of parameter @xmath6 .    .",

    "@xmath37 ( top ) and @xmath38 ( bottom ) . ]",
    "if we consider for simplicity the case @xmath39 , the ground state unnormalized eigenfunction is @xmath40+[01\\dots0;01\\dots0]+ \\dots[0\\dots01;0\\dots01]+o(\\gamma^{-1}),\\ ] ] i.e. on a lattice of length @xmath0 , the unnormalized coefficients @xmath41 of the first @xmath0 terms are equal to unity and the rest are @xmath42 .",
    "in this section we will consider some modifications that can break the translational invariance of the lattice , changing the coefficients @xmath41 and localize the breather around a particular point of the lattice . in these cases , the hamiltonian operator can not be block - diagonalized using eigenvectors of the translation operator . although the computational effort increases , it is still possible to calculate its eigenvalues and eigenvectors if @xmath0 and @xmath11 are small enough , by using algebraic manipulation methods and numerical eigenvalue solvers . in this section",
    "we restrict to the situation @xmath31 .",
    "perhaps the simplest way to break the translational invariance of the lattice is by considering non  flux boundary conditions to simulate a finite  size chain . in this case",
    ", the solution becomes weakly localized around the middle of the lattice .",
    "if @xmath0 is high enough , and we do no take into account boundary effects , this case reduces to the homogeneous lattice case .    a alternative mechanism for breaking the translational invariance can be the existence of local inhomogeneities or impurities . in our model",
    ", this can be modeled by making one or more of the @xmath43 or the @xmath44 dependent on @xmath9 .",
    "this can occur because of localized impurities or long  range interaction between non nearest - neighbors sites due to non  uniform geometries of the lattice chain .",
    "the interplay between these two sources of localization , nonlinearity and impurities is important to understand the properties of these bound states .",
    "two examples of non  uniform geometries are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2]a , a twisted circular geometry causes an interaction between two sites of the chain , which are distant with respect to measurement along the length of the chain .",

    "gordon systems @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the geometry effects can be modeled by adding a long  range interaction term of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the neighbouring sites put brought closer in the twisted  chain case , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the bent  chain case , where @xmath50 is the vertex of the chain .",
    "we will analyze in more detail these modifications that break the translational invariance of the system .",
    "we introduce a local inhomogeneity in the anharmonic parameter in our system and retain periodic boundary conditions , in order to isolate the effect caused by this local inhomogeneity alone .",
    "we put @xmath51 , and @xmath7 for @xmath52 .    in the homogeneous system ,",
    "as discussed above , if the anharmonicity parameter is large enough there exists a high probability of finding the two particles at the _ same _ site of the chain , but with equal probability at _ any _ site of the chain . if we consider a point impurity , a isolated localized bound state appears , as shown in fig .",
