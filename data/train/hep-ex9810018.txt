    "in the previous letter  @xcite , we reported the results of our experimental search for the decay mode @xmath0 , which established the upper limit of @xmath3 ( 90% cl ) on its branching ratio . in this decay mode , cp violation may occur as an interference between two intermediate states with different cp properties  @xcite .",
    "thus it can provide a new testing ground for investigating cp violation .",
    "a theoretical model predicts a branching ratio of about @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "encouraged by this value , we continued the experiment further aiming to establish this decay mode .",
    "recently a group at the fermilab ( ktev ) reported the measurement of its branching ratio based on @xmath5 observed events  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we present our new result  @xcite .    the experiment was conducted with a 12-gev proton synchrotron at high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "the experimental set - up , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - setup ] , was already described in ref .",
    "we used the same set - up with one vital change : the decay volume , which had been filled with helium gas in the preceding run , was evacuated down to @xmath6 torr .",
    "as will be seen , this was very effective to reduce backgrounds originating from nuclear interactions .",
    "below we briefly describe our set - up for convenience .",
    "the @xmath7 beam was produced by focusing 12-gev / c primary protons onto a 60-mm - long copper target .",
    "the divergence of neutral beam was @xmath84  mrad horizontally and @xmath820  mrad vertically . following",
    "the 4-m - long decay volume was a charged particle spectrometer .",
    "it consisted of four sets of drift chambers ( dc1-dc4 ) and an analyzing magnet with an average horizontal momentum kick of 136  mev / c .",
    "the drift chamber position resolution was in average 210  @xmath9 m , and its efficiency was greater than 98% under a typical running condition . a threshold cherenkov counter ( gc ) with pure n@xmath10 gas at 1 atm was placed inside of the magnet gap to identify electrons . for the present decay mode , we obtained , by adjusting software cuts in the off - line analysis , an average electron efficiency of 99.7% with a pion - rejection factor of 50 .",
    "two banks of pure csi electromagnetic calorimeters , located at the far end , measured energy and position of electrons and photons .",
    "its energy and position resolutions were found to be approximately 3% and 7  mm for 1-gev electrons , respectively .",
    "there were 4 sets of trigger scintillation counters , called tc0x , tc1x , tc2x/2y and tc3x , where x(y ) represented a horizontally(vertically)-segmented hodoscope .",
    "the trigger for the present mode was designed to select events with at least three charged tracks which included at least two electrons .",
    "in order to exploit full statistical power of the available data , we combined the present data ( vacuum data ) with the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( he data ) , and analyzed them without distinction",
    ". approximate @xmath11 flux ratio of the vacuum to he data set was @xmath12 .",
    "we closely followed the off - line analysis procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite with refinements at several places . at first",
    ", events were required to have 4 ( and only 4 ) tracks with a common vertex in the beam region inside the decay volume . then particle species were determined .",
    "a pion was identified as a track which could project onto a cluster in the calorimeter ( a matched track ) with @xmath13 , where e and p were an energy deposit measured by the calorimeter and a momentum of the track determined by the spectrometer , respectively .",
    "an electron was identified as a matched track with e @xmath14 200  mev , @xmath15 , and gc hits in the corresponding cells .",
    "the events containing @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 tracks were selected , and then applied two kinematical cuts .",
    "one was the requirement for the invariant mass of @xmath20 pair ( @xmath21 ) to be at least 4  mev@xmath22 ; this cut was effective to suppress backgrounds from external conversion of @xmath23-rays into @xmath20 pair .",
    "the other was a limit on the pion momentum asymmetry ( @xmath24 ) within @xmath25 .",
    "this cut was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to suppress backgrounds due to nuclear interactions , but was found also useful to remove events with pion decays .",
    "the remaining events are our basic event samples for further analysis , and mainly contain both signal mode @xmath0 and normalization mode @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we now identify the normalization mode ( denoted as @xmath28 in the following ) .",
    "we required at least one @xmath23-ray with energy above 200 mev . here",
    "a @xmath23-ray was defined as a cluster in the calorimeter which did not match with any charged tracks .",
    "if more than one @xmath23-ray existed , we selected the one for which the invariant mass of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) was closest to the @xmath31 mass .",
    "then we imposed three major kinematical cuts to select @xmath28 events .",
    "first , the invariant mass of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) was required to be within @xmath32 of the @xmath31 mass ( @xmath33 ) , where the @xmath31 mass resolution @xmath34 was measured to be 4.6  mev / c@xmath35 .",
    "second , @xmath36 was required to be less than 20  mrad@xmath35 , where @xmath37 denotes the angle of the reconstructed @xmath7 momentum with respect to the line connecting the production target and decay vertex . fig .",
    "[ fig - ppeeg - mass ] shows the invariant mass distribution of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) for the events which satisfied all the cuts mentioned so far .",
    "a clear @xmath7 peak can be seen with a mass resolution ( @xmath40 ) of 5.5  mev / c@xmath35 . as a final cut ,",
    "events were requested to lie within @xmath41 of the @xmath7 mass ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "after all the cuts , 12212 events remained  @xcite .",
    "we call these events the @xmath28 reconstructed events .",
    "for the signal mode @xmath0 , the major backgrounds came from @xmath28 events with an extra @xmath23-ray missed from detection .",
    "we employed the same strategy as in ref .",
    "@xcite . at first , we removed events which had extra @xmath23-ray(s ) consistent with @xmath43 .",
    "to reduce the data set size , we also applied at this stage loose kinematical cuts ; @xmath44100  mrad@xmath35 and @xmath45",
    "mev / c@xmath35 , where @xmath46 being the invariant mass of @xmath47 .",
    "then we defined a parameter which quantified consistency of an event with @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter , called @xmath48 , was given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 was an arbitrary momentum of a @xmath23-ray assumed to exist  @xcite .",
    "the standard deviations @xmath34 , @xmath51 and @xmath52  @xcite were all obtained from the @xmath28 reconstructed events .",
    "we determined @xmath50 by minimizing @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig - chi2d ] shows the @xmath53 distribution of the events after minimization .",
    "( here only the events with @xmath4420  mrad@xmath35 and @xmath54 are plotted to illustrate clearly existence of two components . )",
    "the solid and dashed lines in the figure show the results of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , respectively , for the @xmath28 and @xmath55 modes .",
    "the @xmath7 flux in the simulations was normalized with the reconstructed @xmath28 events , and the branching ratio for @xmath55 was assumed to be given by our final result .",
    "we considered the events with @xmath56 as @xmath28 events , and removed from the sample .",
    "the cut rejected 99.7% of the @xmath28 background , while retaining 92% of the signal .",
    "[ fig - ppee - scat](a ) shows the @xmath46 vs @xmath57 scatter plot of the @xmath55 candidate events after the @xmath48 cut . here",
    "the solid dots represent the vacuum data and the plus the he data .",
    "let us first consider the vacuum data .",
    "we notice that there exists a cluster of events ( 15 events ) inside our signal box defined by @xmath4420  mrad@xmath35 and @xmath58 3 @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig - ppee - scat](b ) is the corresponding plot obtained by the @xmath28 mc simulation .",
    "note that the mc statistics in the plot is about 5 times more than the vacuum data .",
    "we also notice that there are non - negligible backgrounds remaining similarly in both plots .",
    "they are more or less uniformly distributed along the @xmath57-direction , and form two distinct bands .",
    "it is found from the mc study that there exist two mechanisms for the @xmath28 events to pass through the @xmath48 cut .",
    "one is @xmath23-radiation : events in which @xmath59 radiates @xmath23-rays internally or externally would loose its energy .",
    "such events constitute the low mass background band .",
    "the other is @xmath60-decay : events in which @xmath61 decays inside the magnet would have wrong momentum assignment .",
    "the high mass backgrounds are due mainly to these events .",
    "next we consider the he data .",
    "there is no event left inside the signal box  @xcite , as was reported in ref .",
    "the backgrounds outside the signal box are spread more broadly compared with the vacuum data .",
    "these events are most probably due to the nuclear interactions off the helium nucleus .",
    "we now want to estimate the number of backgrounds inside the signal box . to this end , we relied upon the fact that , for both he and vacuum data , the background distribution was approximately flat along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "we thus projected the events with @xmath62 onto the @xmath57-axis . the resultant distribution is shown in fig .  [ fig - ppee - proj ] .",
    "there is a clear signal peak at @xmath63 .",
    "the solid line in the figure represents the @xmath28 mc simulation , in which the @xmath7 flux was normalized with the reconstructed @xmath28 events .",
    "we defined a `` control '' region to be @xmath64  mrad@xmath35 .",
    "we then determined a scale factor by normalizing the number of @xmath65 mc events in this region ( 5.2 events ) to that of the data ( 6 events ) .",
    "the number of backgrounds was given by the number of @xmath65 mc events in the signal region ( 1.3 events ) times the scale factor ( 1.15 ) .",
    "we found this to be @xmath66 , where the error includes uncertainty due to the mc statistics . subtracting this from the events inside the signal box",
    ", we determined the number of signal events to be @xmath67 .",
    "the branching ratio was calculated by @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote acceptance , efficiency and observed number of events , respectively .",
    "the detector acceptances were determined by mc simulations , and were found to be @xmath72 for @xmath28 and @xmath73 for @xmath55  @xcite . here , the latter acceptance depends upon the @xmath55 matrix elements ; we employed a theoretical model given by ref .",
    "most of efficiencies were common to the both modes , and they tended to cancel out in the efficiency ratio .",
    "the largest difference stemmed from the detection efficiency of extra @xmath23-rays in @xmath28 . using a mc simulation",
    ", we estimated its inefficiency to be 20.4% .",
    "the @xmath48 cut and @xmath43 inclusive cut were applied only to the signal mode : the efficiency of the former was found to be 92% while the over - veto due to the latter was estimated to be 1% .",
    "we found that all other effects caused negligibly small difference in the ratio of efficiency . using the known branching ratio of @xmath74 and @xmath75  @xcite , we finally arrived at the branching ratio of @xmath76 where the first ( second ) error represents the statistical ( systematic ) uncertainty .",
    "the first one is related to the acceptance - efficiency ratio .",
    "the largest contribution in this category came from uncertainty in the @xmath7 momentum spectrum employed as an input to the various mc studies .",
    "it affected both acceptance and efficiency , and resulted in the fractional uncertainty of 4.8% in the final branching ratio .",
    "the second largest contribution stemmed from uncertainty in the matrix element of the theoretical model .",
    "this brought 3.9% uncertainty in the acceptance ratio .",
    "the second category is related to the number of the events @xmath77 and/or @xmath78 .",
    "we checked stability of the background subtraction by employing different control regions .",
    "actually , widening the region in the @xmath46 direction , we tried @xmath54 and @xmath79 instead of @xmath80 .",
    "we considered the biggest difference resulted from this treatment as a systematic error ( 7.4% ) .",
    "for the he data , we also tested different event shapes assumed for the backgrounds due to the nuclear interaction .",
    "the effect was at most 3.6% as long as they gave statistically consistent results with the null observation .",
    "all other background contaminations , such as external @xmath23-ray conversion events associated with @xmath81 and @xmath26 ( @xmath82 ) , were estimated to be small ( 1.4% ) .",
    "the final category is related to the current experimental errors on the branching ratios @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "summing up all the uncertainties in quadrature , we found the over all systematic error to be 11.3% .",
