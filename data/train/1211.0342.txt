    "it has been noticed @xcite that the ceaseless innovation in semiconductors design creates a demand for better understanding of the physical processes involved in the functioning of modern electronic devices , which operate under  far - from - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the main interest is centered on the behavior of hot  carriers ( electrons and holes ) but the case of hot  phonons is also of interest , particularly in questions such as refrigeration of microprocessors and heat transport in small systems with constrained geometries [ @xcite-@xcite ] .",
    "these questions belong  to the area of non - equilibrium phonon - dynamics @xcite , more precisely to the subject of phonon hydrodynamics associated to non - equilibrium ( irreversible ) thermodynamics [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "it may be noticed the fact that kinetic and hydrodynamics of fluids are intimately coupled .",
    "a first kinetic - hydrodynamic approach can be considered to be the so - called classical ( or onsagerian ) hydrodynamics , which gives microscopic ( mechano - statistical ) foundations to , for example , the classical fourier s and fick s diffusion laws .",
    "but it works under quite restrictive conditions , ( see for example @xcite ) and , hence , more advanced approaches are required to lift these restrictions , mainly , because , as noticed , the requirements for the analysis of situations involved in the nowadays advanced technologies .",
    "several improved approaches were introduced as , for example , the burnett approximation of hydrodynamics @xcite , the one associated to extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , and , recently , the so called mesoscopic hydro - thermodynamics ( mht for short ) dealing with heat transport @xcite covering , in principle , all kinds of motion , that is , involving intermediate to short wavelengths and ultrafast motion . a complete mht for classical fluids is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this communication",
    "we describe the construction of a mht of phonons , presenting an in depth study of phonon hydro - thermodynamics in the framework of a nonlinear quantum kinetic theory based on a non - equilibrium statistical ensemble formalism [ @xcite-@xcite ] , referred to as nesef for short .    in * section ii",
    "* derivation of a phonon higher - order hydrodynamics is presented .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations consist of the coupled sets of time - evolution equations for ( a ) the density  of quasi - particles , together with those for its fluxes of all orders , and ( b ) the density of energy and its fluxes ( heat transport ) of all orders .",
    "the two families of equations are coupled together through thermo - elastic effects .",
    "the practical application of such encumbered sets of equations requires to introduce a contracted description , that is , to  retain only a finite number of fluxes and closing the set of equations by means of auxiliary complementary equations .    in * section iii",
    "* we fully derive a description said of order one , where we retain only the two densities and the first flux of each density .    in * section iv",
    "* we present an analysis of some characteristics of these equations , namely , ( a ) the maxwell times @xcite associated to the densities and fluxes , and ( b ) the construction of a hyperbolic maxwell - cattaneo - like equations for both densities and of a guyer - krumhansl - like equation for the heat flux .    in *",
    "section v * we consider the simpler case when thermo - elastic effects are neglected and the equations for the two densities decouple .    in",
    "* section vi * , on the contrary , thermo - elastic effects are analyzed and used to investigate transient thermal distortion of an optical substrate illuminated by a single intense ultra - short x - ray pulse as currently available in fel facilities .",
    "* section vii * contains our concluding remarks .",
    "details of the calculation are given in several * appendices*.",
    "we consider a system of acoustic phonons in a semiconductor , in anharmonic interaction among them , in interaction with what we call a thermal bath of other degrees of freedom of the system , and in the presence of an external source capable of driving them out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the system is in contact with an external thermostat at temperature @xmath0 . since the divergence of a transverse field vanishes , and since in the absence of vortices the rotational also vanishes , in what regards the _ hydrodynamic motion _ we consider the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons only .    the system hamiltonian quantum mechanical operator is@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian operator of the free la system , namely,@xmath3 with @xmath4 being the frequency dispersion relation , the wavevector @xmath5 runs over the 1st brillouin zone and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are annihilation and creation operators for la phonons in mode @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath8 term accounts for the interaction of the la phonons with what we have called the thermal bath , namely , the anharmonic interaction with the ta phonons , the effect of impurities elastic deformation and interaction with the electrons , or holes , they being , bonded or itinerant , the effect of imperfections ( mainly dislocations ) , and we write for it @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 indicate the corresponding operators associated with transition processes involving the interactions mentioned above ; @xmath12 is the strength coupling in each case . for illustration",
    "let us consider the anharmonic interaction operator between the la and ta phonons , namely@xmath13@xmath14 where the first contribution on the rhs describes the processes @xmath15 , the second the processes @xmath16 , the third @xmath17 and the hermitian conjugate describe the inverse processes .",
    "@xmath18 are the appropriate matrix elements .",
    "the operators @xmath19 lead to the appearance , in the kinetic equation of evolution , of a linear term characterized by a relaxation time @xmath20 , while the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 produce non - linear terms sometimes referred to as lifshits @xcite and frhlich @xcite contributions , respectively .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these non - linear terms produce , when the system is driven ( by the external pumping source ) sufficiently far from equilibrium , a so called complex behavior  [ @xcite , @xcite ] . in the case of phonons , it consists in the emergence of a type of bose - einstein condensation , propagation of long - lived solitons and a kind of laser  action [ @xcite-@xcite ] . in what follows",
    "we shall take the case of not too intense excitation and disregard non - linear contributions , restricting the analysis to the linear ( onsagerian ) regime , when the emergence of complex behavior  is restrained according to prigogine s theorem of minimum entropy production in local equilibrium @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is the hamiltonian of the subsystems involved in the thermal bath , and @xmath24 is the interaction of the la - phonons with the external pumping source , to be specified in each practical application .",
    "next , to apply nesef it is required first of all to specify the basic dynamic variables used to characterize the non - equilibrium ensemble [ @xcite-@xcite ] .",
    "a priori , when the system is driven away from equilibrium , it is necessary to include all observables of the system , which leads to the introduction of many - particle dynamic operators [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "here we use the single - particle dynamic operator@xmath25 in the second quantization representation in reciprocal space , with * q * and * q * running over the brillouin zone .",
    "the two - phonon and higher - order dynamic operators can be ignored because of bogoliubov s principle of correlation weakening [ @xcite , @xcite ] . moreover , since phonons are bosons , it would be necessary also to include the creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 because their eigenstates are the coherent states @xcite , and also the pair operators @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) because the number of quasi - particles is not fixed @xcite .",
    "however , we disregard them because they are of no practical relevance for the problem at hands . in * appendix",
    "a * we describe the corresponding non - equilibrium statistical operator .",
    "the energy of the thermal bath @xmath23 is also a basic microdynamical variable and then we have the basic set@xmath28 where , @xmath29 corresponds to the occupation number operator @xmath30 describing a homogeneous phonon population and those with @xmath31 , namely @xmath32 , account for changes in space of the non - equilibrium phonon distribution function .",
    "the average , over the non - equilibrium ensemble , of the microdynamical variables in the set of eq.([eq6 ] ) provides the variables which characterize the non - equilibrium macroscopic state of the system .",
    "let us call them@xmath33 where @xmath31 and @xmath34 , etc ... , that is , the average of the microdynamical operators of the set ( [ eq6 ] ) over the non - equilibrium ensemble according to the formalism in * appendix a * , where we have introduced the non - equilibrium thermodynamic state variables conjugated to those above , namely [ cf . eq.([eqa3])]@xmath35 where @xmath36 .",

    "it can be considered an extended mori - heisenberg - langevin equation @xcite .",
    "it represents a quite cumbersome set of coupled equations , of unmanageable proportion .",
    "to proceed further it is then necessary to introduce a _ contraction of description _",
    "@xcite , that is to say , a reduction in the number of basic quantities , retaining only a few fluxes .",

    "elsewhere @xcite we have considered the question of the contraction of description ( reduction of dimensions of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic space of states ) , where a criterion for justifying the different levels of truncation is derived : it depends on the range of wavelengths and frequencies which are relevant for the characterization , in terms of normal modes , of the hydro - thermodynamic motion in the nonequilibrium open system .    in other words , since mht implies in describing the motion when governed by smaller and smaller wavelengths , or larger and larger wavenumbers , accompanied by higher and higher frequencies , in a qualitative manner we can say that , as a general  thumb rule ,  the criterion indicates that _ a more and more restricted contraction can be used when larger and larger are the prevalent wavelengths in the motion ( changes smoother and smoother in space and time ) .",
    "_ therefore , in simpler words , when the motion becomes more and more smooth in space and time , the more reduced can be the dimension of the basic macrovariables space to be used for the description of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic state of the system .",
    "it can be conjectured  a general criterion for performing contractions , namely , a contraction of order _ r _ ( meaning keeping the densities and their fluxes  up to order _ r _ ) can be introduced , once we can show that in the spectrum of wavelengths , which characterize the motion , predominate those larger than a frontier  one , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is of the order of the thermal velocity and @xmath90 and @xmath91 the corresponding maxwell times @xcite .    in the next section we consider the situation when it is possible to use a contracted description including only the densities and their first fluxes",
