    "the discovery of a particle with mass around 125 gev and properties consistently compatible with those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite has brought much attention to studies of the scalar sector beyond the sm .",
    "scalar sectors more complex than the sm one are present in many of its extensions .",
    "two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) are a particularly interesting case @xcite ; the general 2hdm without additional symmetries introduces tree level flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) : if they are unsuppressed , conflict with experimental results in the flavour sector is to be expected @xcite .",
    "direct avoidance of tree level fcnc in the 2hdm can be achieved through the imposition of a discrete @xmath1 symmetry , producing `` natural flavour conservation '' @xcite ; another possiblity is the assumption of flavour alignment of the yukawa couplings @xcite ( however , this assumption , in its simplest form , is not well behaved under renormalization group evolution @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative to complete removal of tree level fcnc is the possibility of having them in a controlled manner @xcite",
    ". a particularly interesting case on which this contribution focusses is the class of so - called `` bgl models '' , proposed by branco , grimus and lavoura in @xcite and further studied in @xcite , where the introduction of a symmetry yields tree level fcnc that depend on fermion mixings , fermion masses and the ratio of vacuum expectation values @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , a consistent renormalization group evolution treatment requires addressing both quark and lepton sectors @xcite . in the following a concise introduction to bgl models",
    "is presented , together with the abundant experimental constraints mainly coming from flavour physics that have to be considered before addressing the central scope of this work : a global study of the phenomenological prospects for the different models in this class .",
    "yukawa couplings in the general 2hdm have the following form : @xmath3 where ) are to be understood as 3-vectors ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are accordingly @xmath8 matrices . ]",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the usual left - handed quark and lepton @xmath11 doublets while @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the right - handed @xmath11 singlets ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the scalar @xmath11 doublets and @xmath18 .",
    "spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking by the vacuum expectation values @xmath19 leaves a spectrum in the scalar sector consisting of one charged field @xmath20 and three neutral fields @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; we assume in addition that @xmath21 behaves as the sm higgs , having in particular couplings to fermions proportional to their masses and @xmath24 gev .",
    "for conciseness we focus in the quark sector : @xmath25 where . ]",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 diagonalisation proceeds as usual @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ckm mixing matrix . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not , a priori , diagonalised : @xmath32 in terms of physical fields , we are thus left with @xmath33\\\\ + \\frac{i}{v}i\\bigg[\\bar u\\big({{n}_{u}}{\\gamma_r}-{{n}_{u}^\\dagger}{\\gamma_l}\\big)u-\\bar d\\big({{n}_{d}}{\\gamma_r}-{{n}_{d}^\\dagger}{\\gamma_l}\\big)d\\bigg]\\\\ -\\frac{\\sqrt 2}{v } h^+ \\bar u \\big ( { v}{{n}_{d}}{\\gamma_r}-{{n}_{u}^\\dagger}{v}{\\gamma_l}\\big)d+\\text{h.c.}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where tree level fcnc involving @xmath22 and @xmath23 are explicitly controlled by @xmath34 and @xmath35 . following the bgl proposal @xcite",
    ", we impose symmetry under the following transformation : @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 is 1 or 2 or 3 ( at will ) .",
    "for example , for the @xmath39 case , this explicitely gives @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the different generic entries allowed by eq.([eq : symmetry01 ] ) to be non - zero .",
    "the corresponding mass matrices in eq.([eq : massmat:01 ] ) are @xmath46 and @xmath47 while @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath30 are simultaneously diagonalised , @xmath51 and it is important to stress that @xmath52 has the following block form @xmath53 on the other hand , @xmath54 and @xmath31 are not simultaneously diagonalised since @xmath55 the last term in eq.([eq : fcnc01 ] ) concentrates all the difficulties if we want it to be related to masses , mixings and @xmath56 : @xmath57 appears explicitely and instead of the full mixing matrix @xmath58 , just @xmath59 is involved .",
    "one can understand how these difficulties are bypassed by eq.([eq : symmetry01 ] ) in the following way : if @xmath60 with @xmath61 some fixed matrix , @xmath57 can be traded for @xmath59 since @xmath62 with @xmath63 in eq.([eq : gammamat01 ] ) , @xmath64 where @xmath65 then , @xmath66_{ij}=[u^\\ast_{dl}]_{3i}\\,[u^{\\phantom\\ast}_{dl}]_{3j},\\ ] ] but , because of the block form of @xmath52 in eq.([eq : uul01 ] ) , the elements in the third row of the ckm matrix , @xmath67 , are simply @xmath68_{3i}$ ] and thus eq.([eq : fcnc01 ] ) becomes @xmath69_{ij}-\\left(\\frac{v_2}{v_1}+\\frac{v_1 } { v_2}\\right){v}^\\ast_{3i}{v}^{\\phantom\\ast}_{3j}[{{m}_{d}}]_{jj}\\ ] ] where , as anticipated , fcnc appear at tree level and are controlled by fermion masses , ckm elements and @xmath56 . for this example , @xmath35 reads @xmath70 this detailed example , starting in eq.([eq : symmetry01 ] ) , is just one case : in ( [ eq : symmetry01 ] ) one can as well choose @xmath71 or @xmath72 ; furthermore , instead of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , choosing @xmath75 and @xmath76 , would lead to tree level fcnc in the _ up _ sector instead , giving _",
    "six _ different cases in the quark sector . for the lepton sector",
    ", this same reasoning leads to six possibilities too , for an overall * thirty - six * different models . in the following",
    ", models are labelled by the right - handed fermions transforming non - trivially : e.g. , the previous explicit example has @xmath73 for @xmath39 , the corresponding quark label would simply be @xmath77 ( in addition a _",
    "label is also required to fully define the model ) . for a detailed account of how bgl models can be understood in terms of a minimal flavour violating expansion based on projection operators @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "having presented the general properties of bgl models , we can now concentrate on the different processes which might be affected by non - sm contributions and could provide constraints on the new parameters of interest : the masses of the new scalars ",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80  and @xmath56 .",
    "following @xcite we organise flavour changing processes of interest in terms of the nature of the new physics contributions that are involved :    * processes with contributions mediated by @xmath20 at tree level in addition to the sm @xmath81-mediated tree level ones , such as universality in lepton decays or leptonic and semileptonic decays like @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "* processes with contributions mediated by the neutral scalars @xmath22 , @xmath23 , at tree level and * * contributions from the sm at the loop level as in @xmath85 or neutral meson oscillations , * * negligible sm loop contributions as in @xmath86 or @xmath87 . *",
    "processes with np loop contributions and * * sm loop contributions as in @xmath88 , * * negligible sm loop contributions as in @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , electroweak precision contraints are incorporated through @xmath91 and oblique @xmath92 and @xmath93 constraints .",
    "table [ tab : sum ] provides a summary of the constraints .",
    ".summary table from @xcite ; leading contributions are tagged @xmath94 while subleading or negligible ones are tagged @xmath95.[tab : sum ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for a detailed account of the processes and the numerical values used as input in the analysis , see section 3 and appendices a and b of reference @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this analysis is understanding which are the values of the new parameters  @xmath2 and masses of the scalars @xmath79 , @xmath78 and @xmath80  allowed when all the previous constraints are imposed .",
    "this task is simplified by first paying attention to the effect of the precision electroweak constraints , in particular the oblique parameters . for similar values of @xmath79 , @xmath78 and @xmath80 , the oblique parameters are in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "this fact is illustrated in figure [ fig : scalarmasses ] , where the allowed regions corresponding to the usual 68% , 95% and 99% confidence levels are shown for a particular model , @xmath96 , after the constraints on the oblique parameters are imposed .",
    "therefore , although all three masses are varied independently in the analyses , only results for one of them , @xmath80 , are displayed .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] + .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figures [ fig : all1 ] and [ fig : all2 ] , taken from @xcite , are the central result : they collect the allowed regions ( 68% , 95% and 99% confidence levels ) in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath56 for all 36 models .",
    "some comments are in order .    *",
    "although tree level fcnc experimental constraints on down quark models are a priori tighter than on up quark models , up quark models are not less constrained due to the impact of @xmath97 on the allowed @xmath20 masses . * since @xmath77 and @xmath98 models give a stronger fcnc suppression  because of the hierarchical structure of the ckm matrix  , one would expect them to be less constrained ; nevertheless , the effect of @xmath97 partially changes that picture and @xmath99 models are indeed less constrained than @xmath98 ones .",
    "* it is important to stress that because of the strong suppression achieved for tree level fcnc , the importance of @xmath20 as a window to new physics is enhanced , as the significant role played by @xmath97 shows .",
    "* notice however that , although @xmath97 provides relevant constraints , it is not as determinant as in type ii 2hdm where it automatically forces @xmath100 gev @xcite ; this is due to the different @xmath56 dependence in bgl models with respect to type ii 2hdm ( in addition , this dependence changes in the different bgl models ) .",
    "* concerning the leptonic part , since tree level neutrino fcnc are irrelevant ( because of the small neutrino masses ) , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are a priori less contrained than their neutrino counterparts , nevertheless such differences are insignificant : leptonic constraints are thus secondary once the effect of other constraints is considered . * lower bounds on the scalar masses are in the @xmath104 gev ballpark for many models , opening the window to potential direct searches at the lhc .",
    "there are , however , some exceptions : models of types @xmath105 and @xmath98 require masses above @xmath106 gev ( although a wider range of @xmath56 values is acceptable in those models )",
    ". * finally , it has to be stressed that models of type @xmath77 , the minimal flavour violating ones in the sense of @xcite , are promising but not unique : other models allow for light scalars .",
    "two higgs doublet models of the branco - grimus - lavoura class are a viable scenario where tree level flavour changing neutral currents arise in a controlled manner : they are proportional to mixings , fermion masses and @xmath56 .",
    "the present study shows that despite the existing tight experimental constraints , several types of bgl models are of immediate interest since they can accommodate new scalars light enough to be within direct experimental reach of the lhc .",
