    "the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) can not be explained by assuming that the stars are in equilibrium in a gravitational potential dominated by the baryons : the standard interpretation of the observed stellar kinematics is that the mass distribution of dsphs is everywhere dominated by dark matter ( dm ) , with mass to light - ratios @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this property makes dsphs natural laboratories to study the density distribution of dm halos .",
    "however , although most observational studies agree that dm dominates over baryons even within the half - light radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still debated whether the inner distribution of dm is characterized by a cusp or a core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a consensus is emerging that the best observations disfavour the presence of steep central dm cusps such as those predicted by cosmological @xmath2-body simulations in a concordance @xmath3 cold dark matter universe @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the process of formation of dsphs is still far from complete . in the most popular scenario",
    "dsphs formed originally as gas rich dwarf irregular or disc galaxies and then lost their gas as a consequence of internal or environmental effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a successful formation model should be able to account for the all the properties of dsphs that can be inferred from observations , such as the structure and kinematics of the stellar distribution , metallicity of stars , and star formation history .",
    "several studies have been carried out trying to reproduce at least some of these properties with either cosmological hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , simulations of isolated halos @xcite or semi - analytic models @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the two specific properties of dsphs : the facts that dm dominates the mass budget throughout these galaxies and that the present - day dm profile is not divergent in the central regions .",
    "several mechanisms are likely to jointly determine the dm distribution of dsphs : baryon removal by supernova feedback or ram pressure @xcite , clumpy baryonic infall @xcite and stellar - feedback driven fluctuations of the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "this last mechanism has recently drawn the attention of several authors who explored its feasibility within a cosmological framework @xcite .",
    "however , given the uncertainties on the physics of stellar feedback , it is unclear whether the properties of present - day dsphs can be explained by the associated gravitational potential fluctuations @xcite .",
    "here we argue that in the progenitors of dsphs the distribution of dm was substantially affected by baryons _ before _ star formation got underway , because in these systems star formation is inevitably preceded by the formation of massive baryonic clumps .",
    "the orbital decay of these clumps erased the central cusps of their host halos .",
    "we present a coherent picture that leads from the cosmological dm halo to the matter distribution of a present - day dsph , taking as reference objects the classical dsphs of the milky - way .",
    "we do not attempt to simulate self - consistently the entire formation and evolution process , but we focus on the most important steps , demonstrating quantitatively that the proposed picture is feasible .",
    "we envisage the following scenario for the formation and early evolution of the baryonic and dark components of dsphs .    1 .",
    "the host dm halo is initially cuspy as predicted by cosmological @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "2 .   gas accumulates in the halo potential well and settles into a disc .",
    "the infall of gas initially tends to make the halo cuspier , but the effect is small as long as the gas density is lower than the dm density .",
    "once the gas density becomes higher than the local dm density , the gas disc becomes unstable and starts to fragment .",
    "5 .   since the gas temperature is not negligible with respect to the system virial temperature , the disc fragments into large clumps of gas .",
    "these big clumps transfer energy to the dm particles via dynamical friction : the halo is quickly heated and the central cusp is flattened into a core .",
    "subsequently , stars start to form in the clumps , and efficient stellar feedback then expels most of the gas , so the final stellar density is much lower than both the initial gas density and the final dm density .",
    "the aim of this work is to give a quantitative description of the main physical processes involved in the above scenario , focusing in particular on demonstrating that fragmentation occurs where baryons are dominant ( iv ) , that the resulting gas clumps are very massive ( v ) , and that these clumps quickly flatten the original dm cusp ( vi ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the idea that the dm profiles of dsphs are flattened by baryonic clumps has been considered in other works @xcite .",
    "here we put this proposal into a broader context by modelling the coevolution of dm and baryons in dsphs starting from cosmic gaseous accretion and estimating self - consistently the properties of the gaseous clumps responsible for the flattening of the dm density profile .",

    "the fact that the dm mass within @xmath141 is higher than in the initial conditions ( @xmath142 ) is a consequence of the contraction of the halo due to the presence of the baryons .",

    "the final profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : den ] result from the combination of contraction due to baryonic infall and expansion due to dynamical friction heating .",
    "we verified with simple @xmath2-body experiments that if the same halo evolves in the absence of the clumps , but in the presence of a fixed gravitational potential representing the corresponding smooth gas distribution , the central dm profile quickly ( @xmath184 ) settles into a new equilibrium configuration with slightly steeper central slope ( @xmath185 for model t2 and @xmath186 for model t3 ) than the initial @xmath187 .",
    "however , when the gas fragments into clumps , the slight steepening due to contraction is overwhelmed by heating through dynamical friction , and the final profiles are cored with @xmath0 .      for the mechanism described above to be effective , the lifetime of the gas clumps must be at least of the same order as the time ( @xmath188 ) necessary to redistribute the dm in the central regions of the halo . in general ,",
    "the question of the evolution of massive clouds in galaxies is complex and highly debated , especially because it is strictly related to the poorly understood process of star formation and associated feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the specific context here considered , a few simple arguments suggest that the assumption of a long clump lifetime is a reasonable one .",
    "it is widely accepted that any mechanism responsible for cloud disruption starts to act after the formation of the first stars . at @xmath189 metal - poor gas",
    "has difficulty cooling , especially in the absence of molecules , and molecules form with difficulty in the absence of dust .",
    "the time - scale for star formation can not be shorter than the longer of the cloud s initial dynamical time @xmath190 and the cooling time @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the cooling rate per molecule and @xmath193 is the molecular - hydrogen fraction ( @xmath194 is the molecular - hydrogen number density and @xmath195 is the total gas number density ) .",
    "taking as gas density @xmath196 and estimating @xmath197 from equation 2.32 of @xcite , for our models we get @xmath198 and @xmath199 when @xmath87 , and @xmath200 and @xmath201 when @xmath88 . notwithstanding the dependence of @xmath202 on the poorly constrained parameter @xmath203 , these numbers suggest that the star - formation time - scale should not be shorter than a few tens of megayears .",
    "even when the first burst of star formation occurs , the cloud is not immediately shattered : if cloud disruption is due to supernovae , which however is controversial @xcite , @xmath204 from the onset of star formation is required for massive stars to complete their lives .",
    "independent arguments in favour of long cloud lifetimes derive from observations of the milky way .",
    "even the dusty , metal - enriched gas of the current galactic disc converts to stars extremely slowly in the sense that less than one percent of a molecular cloud is turned into stars in a dynamical time .",
    "moreover , since the overwhelming majority of the gas interior to the sun is in molecular form , molecular clouds can not be easily dissociated by star formation : their estimated lifetime is @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "based on the above discussion , we expect clouds to orbit within the dark halo for several dynamical times before they are dissipated by stellar feedback .",
    "thus we expect clouds to heat the halo for many dynamical times and to leave a dm - dominated galaxy when they are finally disrupted .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the lifetime of the clumps is a crucial parameter of the presented model and it would be highly desirable to obtain better constraints on it .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , before star formation , dwarf - galaxy sized cosmological halos are expected to host gaseous clumps with masses , sizes and orbits such that they quickly flatten the original dm cusp .",
    "the idea that massive clouds can effectively heat stellar systems dates back at least to @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that a similar mechanism ( baryonic clumps heating dm halos ) could be responsible for turning dm cusps into cores .",
    "subsequent work elaborated on this proposal , by considering specific applications to clusters of galaxies @xcite or exploring the space of parameters by varying the density and velocity distribution of the host system and the clump mass , size and orbits @xcite .",
    "the results of these works clearly indicated , as a proof of concept , that dynamical friction heating by clumps can have an important role in halos on different scales and that , quantitatively , the relevance of this process depends on the properties of the clumps and of the host halo .",
    "however , not so much work has been done to quantify this effect specifically on the scale of dwarf galaxies . here ,",
    "though in an idealized framework , we try to estimate self - consistently the masses , sizes and orbits of the clumps and their effect on the dm distribution in a dwarf - sized halo of mass @xmath206 . in this sense , among previous works , our investigation is most similar to that of @xcite who simulated , with a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , the formation of a disc galaxy in a relatively massive dm halo of @xmath207 , finding significant evolution of the halo density profile due to interaction with baryonic clumps .",
    "however , these results can not be extrapolated to the smaller scale of dwarf galaxies , because , as stressed above , a crucial quantity in the process is the ratio between the gas temperature at the time of fragmentation ( set by quantum physics ) and the virial temperature of the halo ( set by gravity ) .    as an alternative to the mechanism considered in the present work , it has been suggested that the dominant factor in determining the final dm distribution is fluctuations of the gravitational potential that are driven by stellar feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such a scenario energy is transferred to the dm by the bulk motions of gas driven by repeated bursts of star formation .",
    "though this scenario shares some features with the one considered in the present paper ( gas clumps moving in the halo transfer energy to the dm ) , it must be stressed that the two scenarios are conceptually and materially different : in their model , aimed at mimicking the gas bulk motions induced by successive episodes of stellar feedback , three massive clumps move as harmonic oscillators through the system s centre . ] : in one case the process occurs before star formation and the energy source is gravitational , in the other case the process occurs after star formation and the energy source is stellar feedback .",
    "the two mechanisms might be alternative or even cooperate during the formation and evolution of dsphs ( see , for a discussion , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , if the mechanism studied in our work is effective , it occurs before star formation and therefore earlier with respect to stellar - feedback driven processes .",
    "the effectiveness of the dynamical friction heating mechanism depends crucially on the lifetime of the clumps , which is a debated question . in section  [ sec : evol ] we have argued that , at least in the considered case of dwarf galaxies , the primordial clumps are expected to live long enough to erase the central dm cusp .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are now dm dominated , but stars can not form until gas becomes locally gravitationally dominant .",
    "dissipation causes gas to move inward within a dm halo until this condition is satisfied .",
    "when the mass of gas is small compared to the dm mass , considerable contraction is required to achieve gravitational dominance , and near - conservation of angular momentum will cause the gas distribution to become flattened .",
    "a differentially rotating body of gas will be heated by the processes that heat accretion discs , so its temperature will be much greater than that of the cosmic background radiation even in the case in which heating at the time of infall is extremely inefficient . in the absence of cooling by metal ions",
    ", it seems likely that , the temperature of the gas will rise to temperatures @xmath208 at which cooling by hydrogen becomes non - negligible , but we have considered also temperatures an order - of - magnitude lower .    in the potential of a low - mass halo",
    ", the disc may not be very thin , but equilibrium dynamical models of bodies of spinning gas moving in the common gravitational potential of the gas and dm suggest that it is probably thin enough for toomre s seminal analysis of the stability of thin discs to yield the wavelength at which fragmentation first occurs to within a factor of a few .",
    "this wavelength in turn specifies the mass of the fragments into which the gas divides .",
    "the key point is that this mass is not very much smaller than the mass of dm interior to the radius where fragmentation starts .",
    "consequently , only a few local dynamical times are required for the fragments to transfer significant energy to the local dm particles .",
    "therefore the halo s central cusp is heated to form a core with central logarithmic density slope @xmath0 before stellar feedback enters the scene .",
    "we have simulated this transfer with an @xmath2-body code , and find that it quickly erases the cusp at the centre of the original dm halo .",
    "this result is not at all surprising ; the existence of dm cusps has always been rather puzzling since they depend on the velocity dispersion within the halo decreasing to zero as one approaches the centre",
    ". any gravitational scattering of the ultra - cool particles that form the cusp will raise the central velocity dispersion and erase the cusp .",
    "hence the wonder is that such scattering does not occur during hierarchical merging of dm .    in a dm only simulation , the only objects capable of such scattering within a given halo are halos of smaller mass that reach the centre of the host halo .",
    "these halos have at their centres cusps that are dense , so are not tidally disrupted until the satellite halo has reached the very centre of it host ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it seems likely that cusp particles in the host halo that are upscattered by the satellite halo are efficiently replaced by the satellite halo s own cusp particles .",
    "gas can easily form clouds massive enough to scatter particles out of the host halo s cusp , and a gas cloud does not replace these particles . when the massive stars that form within the cloud disrupt it , the host halo is left dm dominated and in possession of a core .",
    "this cusp erasing process will be efficient unless the gas cools to such low temperatures that it does not fragment until a _ very _ thin disc has formed . since quantum physics sets the minimum temperature for efficient cooling",
    ", discs can be very thin at the onset of fragmentation only in higher - mass halos ( which have higher virial temperatures ) . in these halos",
    "star formation is known to be more efficient in the sense that a greater fraction of gas is converted to stars before residual gas is returned to the intergalactic medium . in this case",
    "the stellar disc is likely to be self - gravitating , so it can become bar - unstable .",
    "a stellar bar quickly transfers energy to a co - spatial dm cusp @xcite , so spiral galaxies with bars will not have dm cusps either . in principle",
    "there might be an intermediate halo mass at which star formation is so inefficient that it leaves a completely dm dominated stellar disc , and yet at the onset of fragmentation the gas disc is sufficiently thin for the resulting gas clouds to be inefficient scatterers . then in these intermediate - mass halos dm cusps would survive star formation .",
    "but the existence of this intermediate range of halo masses seems unlikely , so stars and dm cusps are probably mutually exclusive .",
