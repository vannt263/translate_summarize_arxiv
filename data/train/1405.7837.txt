    "toom  @xcite studied a family of probabilistic cellular automata on @xmath1 which have a unique stationary state at high noise level and ( at least ) two stationary states for low noise .",
    "most remarkably , the low noise states are stable against small changes in the update rules  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to models satisfying the condition of detailed balance .",
    "for example the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnetic ising model with glauber spin flip dynamics at sufficiently low temperatures and zero external magnetic field , @xmath2 , has two equilibrium phases with non - zero spontaneous magnetization .",
    "but by a small change of @xmath3 uniqueness is regained  @xcite .",
    "we consider the 2d toom model with nec ( north east center ) majority rule .",
    "the system consists of ising spins ( @xmath4 ) located on a square lattice which evolve in discrete time .",
    "( we use magnetic language only for convenience . in physical realizations",
    "@xmath5 is a two - valued order parameter field ) . at each time step , all spins @xmath5 are updated independently according to the rule @xmath6 for @xmath7 we have a deterministic evolution : each updated spin becomes equal to the majority of itself and of its northern and eastern neighbors .",
    "non - zero @xmath8 represents the effect of a noise which favors the @xmath9 sign with probability @xmath10 and the @xmath11 sign with probability @xmath12 .",
    "it was proved by toom that for low enough noise ( @xmath8 sufficiently small ) the automaton has at least two translation invariant stationary states , such that the spins are predominantly @xmath9 or @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the probability with which one is obtained depends on the initial conditions .    to investigate the spatial coexistence of the two phases , specific boundary conditions were introduced in  @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the toom model restricted to the third quadrant was studied with the boundary conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and all @xmath16 . since the information is traveling southwest , in the long time limit a steady state is reached , for which the upper part is in one phase and the lower half in the other one .",
    "the phases are bordered by an interface which fluctuates but has a definite slope , depending on @xmath8 , on the macroscopic scale . of interest",
    "are steady state static and dynamical fluctuations of this non - equilibrium interface .",
    "since both pure phases have already a nontrivial intrinsic structure , to analyse properties of the interface seems to be a difficult enterprise . in  @xcite a low noise approximation is used for which the interface is governed by an autonomous stochastic dynamics in continuous time , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the interface can be represented by a spin configuration on the semi - infinite lattice @xmath17 .",
    "such spin configurations inherit then a dynamics in which spins are randomly exchanged .",
    "it is this toom spin exchange model described below which is the focus of our contribution .",
    "for more information we refer to  @xcite .",

    "the bernoulli measures are stationary under this dynamics and we label them by their average magnetization , @xmath29 . on a finite ring of @xmath18 sites the dynamics is correspondingly defined , replacing right by clockwise .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig1 ] , the interface is enforced by a hard wall at @xmath30 , that is , spin configurations are restricted to the half lattice @xmath31 , but the dynamics remains unaltered .",
    "the toom spin model on the half lattice has an unusual independence property .",
    "if one considers the dynamics of the subsystem @xmath32 , then it evolves as a continuous time markov chain .",
    "however the magnetization is no longer conserved .",
    "if , for some @xmath33 , the entire block @xmath34 $ ] has spin @xmath9 , then @xmath35 flips to @xmath36 with rate @xmath23 and correspondingly for a block of touching the right border the flip is done with rate 1 . as a consequence ,",
    "a unique limiting probability measure is approached as @xmath37 . in our approximation ,",
    "the height of anchored interface of the toom automaton is just the magnetization of the toom spin model , @xmath38 the argument @xmath16 is omitted in case the @xmath24-dependence at fixed @xmath16 is considered .",
    "averages in the steady state are denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "note that by time stationarity and time correlations such as @xmath40 depend only on @xmath41 .",
    "at @xmath42 the interface is along the diagonal and fluctuates symmetrically , @xmath43 , while for @xmath44 the interface becomes asymmetric .",
    "based on theoretical and numerical evidence , in  @xcite it was concluded that , for large @xmath24 , @xmath45 with possibly logarithmic corrections , while @xmath46 most remarkably , using the then just being developed multi - spin coding techniques , the full probability density function ( pdf ) for @xmath47 was recorded , see  @xcite , fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath42 , the pdf",

    "the variance differed however by a logarithmic correction from the @xmath48 prediction , in the scaling limit , given by the cva . for @xmath49 ,",

    "this is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 the standard airy function . somewhat _",

    "looking eighteen years later at the same figure , with the hindsight of the much improved understanding of the kpz universality class , it is a safe guess that in fact a tracy - widom distribution from random matrix theory is displayed . apparently the fluctuations of the anchored toom interface share the same fate as the length of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations . without knowing ,",
    "odlyzko  @xcite observed the gue tracy - widom distribution .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a more complete account of the history . for us",
    "3 of  @xcite is a compelling motivation to return to the fluctuations of the anchored toom interface and to understand better how they fit into the kpz universality class .    in this note",
    ", we will provide numerical and theoretical evidence that in fact @xmath52 for large @xmath24 and @xmath44 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 depend on @xmath23 and are computed explicitly .",
    "the random amplitude @xmath54 is goe tracy - widom distributed .",
    "the general form of ( [ 1.4 ] ) is familiar from other models in the kpz universality class . to have fluctuations governed by the goe edge distribution came as a complete surprise and has not been anticipated before . to be on the safe side we also investigate the covariance @xmath55 and compare it with the prediction coming from the covariance of the airy@xmath56 process .",
    "besides running multi - spin coding on more modern machines , we present a much improved analysis on interchanging the role of space and time for the interface dynamics .",
    "to study the fluctuations of the toom interface , it is convenient to start from a mesoscopic description of the height @xmath57 where @xmath58 stands for the continuum approximation of @xmath24 .",
    "firstly note that on @xmath26 the toom spin model conserves the magnetization and thus has a one - parameter family of stationary states labeled by the average magnetization , @xmath59 . in the steady state",
    "the spins are independent and the spin current is given by @xmath60 see  @xcite . for the anchored toom interface",
    "we expect ( and have checked numerically ) that in small segments very far away from the origin the spins will be independent , so that , @xmath61 as @xmath62 at fixed @xmath63 . to have a stationary state for the semi - infinite system thus requires @xmath64 . using ( [ 2.1 ] ) this has the unique solution @xmath65 which determines the asymptotic magnetization .",
    "if @xmath3 is slowly varying on the scale of the lattice , then locally it will maintain a definite slope @xmath66 .",
    "the local slope is conserved , hence governed by the conservation law @xmath67 which should be viewed as the euler equation for the magnetization of the spin model .",
    "equivalently , there is a hamilton - jacobi type equation for @xmath3 , @xmath68 with @xmath69 as stationary solution .    to describe on a mesoscopic scale the statistical properties of the toom interface",
    ", we follow the common practice to add noise to the deterministic equation ( [ 2.3c ] ) , see for example  @xcite . more concretely to the spin current in ( [ 2.3a ] ) we add the dissipative term @xmath70 , @xmath71 the diffusion constant , and , since local exchanges are essentially uncorrelated , the space - time white noise @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is normalized and @xmath74 is the noise strength .",
    "since the deviation from the constant slope profile @xmath75 will be studied , in fact it suffices , by power counting , to keep the current @xmath76 up to second order relative to @xmath77 as @xmath78 where @xmath79 thereby one obtains that on a mesoscopic scale the fluctuating height @xmath80 is governed by @xmath81 for @xmath82 . for the toom interface",
    "the height is pinned at the origin which leads to the restriction @xmath83 and the boundary condition @xmath84 the coefficients @xmath85 depend on @xmath23 . if @xmath86 , as is the case for @xmath42 , the second order expansion does not suffice .",
    "fourth order is irrelevant , but the third order term generates logarithmic corrections  @xcite , which are the theoretical reason behind the already mentioned logarithmic corrections for the interface variance at @xmath42 .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) is the much studied one - dimensional kpz equation  @xcite with two important differences .",
    "firstly the height function is over the half - line , being pinned at the origin , and secondly there is the outward drift @xmath87 , which can not be removed because of this boundary condition . at such brevity",
    "our reasoning may look _",
    "ad hoc_. but the scheme should be viewed as a particular case of the kpz scaling theory  @xcite , which has been confirmed through extensive monte carlo simulations for related models , for example see  @xcite .    for magnetization",
    "@xmath59 the spin susceptibility @xmath88 equals , for independent spins , @xmath89 and at @xmath77 is given by , @xmath90 to connect with the parameters of eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) , one checks that on @xmath91 the steady state has the slope statistics given by spatial white noise with variance @xmath92",
    ". therefore we identify as @xmath93 in the scaling regime only @xmath88 will appear , which is unambiguously defined by ( [ 2.7 ] ) in terms of the spin model , while @xmath71 and @xmath74 separately are regarded as phenomenological coefficients . as for @xmath94 ,",
    "our focus is the stationary process determined by ( [ 2.6 ] ) , ( [ 2.2c ] ) .",
    "considering eq . ( [ 2.6 ] ) , it would be of advantage to interchange @xmath58 and @xmath16 , because then the boundary value @xmath95 turns into an initial condition , which is more accessible . from the perspective of stochastic partial differential equation",
    ", such an interchange looks impossible .",
    "but once we write the cole - hopf solution of ( [ 2.6 ] ) , for example see  @xcite , our scenario becomes fairly plausible .",
    "the cole - hopf transformation is defined by @xmath96 which satisfies @xmath97 on @xmath98 with boundary condition @xmath99 and some initial condition @xmath100 .",

    "the stationary process for all @xmath115 is obtained by shifting @xmath20 in @xmath16 as @xmath116    to understand the interchange between @xmath58 and @xmath16 , at least in principle , we discretize ( [ 2.12 ] ) by replacing @xmath117 by @xmath118 .",

    "the continuum limit equals @xmath132 and in the second version @xmath133 .",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) corresponds to the first version .",
    "instead we now take @xmath131 as time axis and consider the continuum version of the partition function as in eq .",

    "the limit in ( [ 3.7 ] ) implies that , for large @xmath58 , @xmath216 returning to the toom interface one arrives at the result that , for large @xmath24 , @xmath217 based on kpz scaling theory , ( [ 3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.11 ] ) are our predictions for the fluctuations of the toom interface .",
    "they will be tested numerically in the following section .",
    "the toom spin model lends itself well for an efficient simulation technique , often referred to as multispin coding  @xcite , which was used already in  @xcite and is used also in this study .",
    "the basic idea is that the time - consuming part of the algorithm is written down as a sequence of single - bit operations , but the computer then acts on 64-bit words , thereby performing 64 simulations simultaneously .",
