    "ams  @xcite ( alpha magnetic spectrometer ) is a precision spectrometer designed to search for cosmic antimatter , dark matter and to study the relative abundance of elements and isotopic composition of the primary cosmic rays .",
    "it will be installed in the international space station ( iss ) , where it will operate at least for three years .",
    "the spectrometer will be capable of measuring the rigidity ( @xmath0 ) , the charge ( @xmath1 ) , the velocity ( @xmath2 ) and the energy ( @xmath3 ) of cosmic rays within a geometrical acceptance of @xmath40.5m@xmath5sr .",
    "[ fig : ams ] shows a schematic view of the ams spectrometer .",
    "the system is composed of several subdectors : transition radiation detector ( trd ) , time - of - flight ( tof ) , silicon tracker ( std ) , anticoincidence counters ( acc ) , superconducting magnet , ring imaging erenkov  detector and electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "[ fig : ams ]",
    "the rich is a proximity focusing device with a dual radiator configuration on the top made of 92 aerogel 25 mm thick tiles with a refractive index 1.050 and sodium fluoride ( naf ) tiles with a thickness of 5 mm in the center covering an area of 34@xmath634cm@xmath5 .",
    "the naf placement prevents the loss of photons in the hole existing in the center of the readout plane ( @xmath8 cm@xmath5 ) , in front of the ecal calorimeter located below .",
    "the detection matrix is composed of 680 multipixelized photon readout cells each consisting of a photomultiplier coupled to a light guide , hv divider plus front - end ( fe ) electronics , all housed and potted in a plastic shell and then enclosed in a magnetic shielding .",
    "the photon detection is made with an array of multianode hamamatsu tubes ( r7600 - 00-m16 ) coupled to a light guide .",
    "the effective pixel size is 8.5 mm .",
    "a high reflectivity conical mirror surrounds the whole set .",
    "it consists of a carbon fiber reinforced composite substrate with a multilayer coating made of aluminium and sio@xmath9 deposited on the inner surface .",
    "this ensures a reflectivity higher than 85% for 420 nm wavelength photons .",
    "( left ) shows a schematic view of the rich detector .",
    "rich was designed to measure the velocity ( @xmath10 ) of singly charged particles with a resolution @xmath11 of 0.1@xmath12 , to extend the charge separation ( z ) up to iron ( z=26 ) , to contribute to @xmath13 separation and to albedo rejection .    in order to validate the rich design ,",
    "a prototype with an array of 9@xmath611 cells filled with 96 photomultiplier readout units similar to part of the matrix of the final model was constructed .",
    "the performance of this prototype has been tested with cosmic muons and with a beam of secondary ions at the cern sps produced by fragmentation of a primary beam in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "the light guides used were prototypes with a slightly smaller collecting area ( 31@xmath631mm@xmath5 ) .",
    "different samples of the radiator materials were tested and placed at an adjustable supporting structure .",
    "different expansion heights were set in order to have fully contained photon rings on the detection matrix like in the flight design .",
    "a segment of a conical mirror with 1/12 of the final azimuthal coverage , which is shown in left picture of , was also tested .",
    "the rich assembly has already started at ciemat in spain and is foreseen to be finished in july 2007 .",
    "a rectangular grid has already been assembled and has been subject to a mechanical fit test , functional tests , vibration tests and vacuum tests .",
    "the other grids will follow .",
    "the refractive index of the aerogel tiles is being measured and the radiator container was subjected to a mechanical test .",
    "the final integration of rich in ams will take place at cern in 2008 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     runs with a mirror prototype were also performed and its reflectivity was derived from data analysis .",
    "the obtained value is in good agreement with the manufacturer value .",
    "ams-02 will be equipped with a proximity focusing rich enabling velocity measurements with a resolution of about 0.1% and extending the charge measurements up to the iron element .",
    "velocity reconstruction is made with a likelihood method .",
    "charge reconstruction is made in an event - by - event basis .",
    "evaluation of both algorithms on real data taken with in - beam tests at cern , in october 2003 was done .",
    "the detector design was validated and a refractive index 1.05 aerogel was chosen for the radiator , fulfilling both the demand for a large light yield and a good velocity resolution .",
    "the rich detetector is being constructed and its assembling to the ams complete setup is foreseen for 2008 ."
