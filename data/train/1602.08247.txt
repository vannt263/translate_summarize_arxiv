    "over several decades different models of @xmath0 operads suitable for different purposes have been introduced : the little 2-cubes operad @xmath1 @xcite , the little 2-discs operad @xmath2 , the steiner operad @xmath3 @xcite which combines the good properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and more recently the fulton - macpherson operad @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although as @xmath0operads they are all quasi  isomorphic , the individual homotopies are of interest . for the first list these are established by realizing that up to natural homotopy , ( e.g.  contracting intervals ) these spaces are configuration spaces @xmath5 of @xmath6 distinct ordered points on @xmath7 , whose homotopy type is known to be that of a @xmath8 .",
    "renewed interest in @xmath0 operads stems from various solutions of deligne s hochschild cohomology conjecture @xcite and in the development of string topology @xcite . in this",
    "setting cactus type operads were invented @xcite .",
    "on the toplogical level , as we discuss , these are basically all isomorphic to the @xmath0 operad @xmath9 of spineless cacti introduced in @xcite .",
    "the arity @xmath6 space @xmath10 roughly consists of isotopy classes of embeddings of circles with positive radii into the plane such that the images form a planted rooted planar tree picture of lobes modulo incidence parameters . for this operad and its other isomorphic versions , the proof of being and",
    "@xmath0 operad is rather indirect .",
    "it was shown using pure braid group technique of fiedorowicz @xcite and cellular operad technique of berger @xcite .",
    "we now offer a direct topological proof for the part of fiedorowicz recognition concerning the homotopy type .    using the different perspective of permutahedral covers , we prove the homotopy equivalence between @xmath11 and @xmath10 explicitly by constructing a single homotopy equivalence between them .",
    "permutahedra are an essential tool in the detection of loop spaces starting with milgram @xcite , see @xcite for nice reviews .",
    "they also appear in various other contexts , see e.  g.   @xcite",
    ". the full list would be too long to reproduce .",
    "they are still an active topic of research , especially through their connection to configuration spaces of points @xmath11 , which is how they appear in the @xmath0 operad story , see @xcite . from a totally different motivation ,",
    "it has recently be shown how @xmath11 deformation retracts to milgram s permutahedral model @xmath12 obtained by gluing @xmath13 copies of permutahedra @xmath14 along their proper faces @xcite .",
    "this applies directly to all the @xmath0 operads above based on cofiguration spaces , giving them all a permutaheral structure , i.e.  they appear as a quotient of permutahedral space @xmath15 and are homotopy equivalent to milgrams model . here and below",
    ", we write @xmath16 for the symmetric group on @xmath6 letters .",
    "the exception are spineless cacti @xmath9 and the models related to it , which are of a different breed . while the configuration models , are adapted to acting on loop spaces , through this connection spineless cacti and its relatives are adapted to acting on hochschild complexes , or operads with multiplication .",
    "we will prove that spineless cacti and hence all of its incarnations , see  [ discussionpar ] , have a permutahedral cover .",
    "the appearance of permutahedra in this model is very surprising , although the construction with hindsight looks very natural . after passing to normalized spineless cacti , i.e.  the spaces @xmath17",
    ", we will show that they admit a presentation @xmath18 as the quotient of @xmath13 copies of @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that here there is not only a gluing along faces , but parts of the interior of the permutahedra are identified .",
    "we give an explicit description .",
    "namely , @xmath17 is a cw complex whose cells are indexed by a certain type of labelled rooted ( actually planted ) planar trees .",
    "each planar tree has an underlying poset structure which transfers to the set of labels .",
    "we can succinctly state that each permutahedron corresponds to a possible total order on @xmath19=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] , viz .",
    "a permutation , and it is comprised of the sub - cw complex of cells indexed by partial orders on @xmath19 $ ] that are compatible with the given total order . the gluing is then along the cells that are indexed by non",
    " total orders .",
    "going beyond this , there is an explicit relation between the codimension of the cells and a partial order the partial orders .",
    "the highest co  dimension cells , that is cells of dimension @xmath20 are indexed by the partial order in which no elements are comparable . since we are dealing with planar trees , see @xcite , there are again orders on the sets of equal height , which means that there are indeed @xmath13 dimension @xmath20 cells , which are the vertices of the permutahedra .",
    "these combinatorics are all explained in detail below .    due to the nature of the quotient",
    ", there is a natural map @xmath21 , whose description already yields a quasi  isomorphism .",
    "we will explicitly construct the homotopy inverse induced from compatible homotopies on the @xmath13 @xmath14 . in a sense",
    ", this map answers the question `` where are the centers of the lobes in cacti ? '' .",
    "this is not as straightforward as for the little discs , where the centers are given by the projection onto the factor of configuration space .",
    "for spineless cacti , @xmath22 corresponds to the centers .",
    "the quotient of @xmath23 shows how this is related to configuration .",
    "recall , that @xmath22 has a topological operad structure , which is associative up to homotopy .",
    "an that this already induces an operad structure on the cellular level .",
    "no such structure is known for @xmath23 .",
    "this also explains , why it was so difficult to find a proof of deligne s conjecture .",
    "one can say that the operad structure only become apparent after taking quotients , see  [ discussionpar ] .",
    "this is astonishing , since instead of enlarging , we make things smaller by taking quotients .",
    "the methods we use , are classical maps and homotopies , but for the combinatorics , we use partial orders , partitions and b / w planar trees .",
    "for these , we give a common treatment and introduce several new operators , which link our work to that of connes and kreimer .",
    "another upshot of our treatment is a new cellular decomposition of permutahedra , which has a cube at its core and then has @xmath24 shells for each @xmath14 . in the tree language ,",
    "the @xmath25th shell is given by trees with initial branching number @xmath25 .",
    "there is also a nice duality between the outer faces in this decomposition of @xmath26 and the top  dimensional cells of @xmath14 leading to a recursion .",
    "this is established via the operators mentioned above .",
    "the decomposition of the @xmath14 also allows us to recognize them as the cells responsible for the dyer  lashof operations .",
    "in retrospect , spineless cacti are a natural geometric model for the sequence operad of @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "we make this explicit in  [ isopar ] .",
    "this gives a way to show that the model of formulas @xcite and hence sequences have the right homotopy type .",
    "our topological result also implies the result @xcite on the quasi - isomorphism between the cellular chains of @xmath12 and the cellular chains of @xmath17 .",
    "see  [ discussionpar ] for more details on these remarks .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ permutasec ] fixes frequently used notations and introduces the definition of unshuffless of a sequence . in it , we also recall the definition and basic properties of the permutahedron @xmath14 and the permutahedral structure @xmath12 of @xmath11 . section  [ spineslesssec ] recalls the definition of spineless cacti and make explicit its polysimplicial structure .",
    "the permutahedral structure @xmath18 of @xmath17 is given in ",
    "[ mainsec ] using partial and total orders .",
    "this contains one direction of the homotopy equivalence . here , we also introduce four operators @xmath27 acting on trees that are essential in keeping track of the combinatorics .",
    "these operators are analogous to those used in @xcite .",
    "the homotopy equivalences between @xmath12 and @xmath18 is proven in section  [ homotopysec ] , by giving and explicit homotopy inverse .",

    "we then set up the combinatorial language , which we will use for indexing .",
    "this is unavoidably a bit complex , as we will have to deal with lists of lists .",
    "thus we will introduce a short hand notation for these lists and manipulations on them .",
    "besides reducing clutter , an additional benefit is an easy description of a poset structure and a grading .",
    "this allows us to encode the poset structure of the faces of permutahedra in this formalism .",

    "see @xcite[chapter2.4 ] as a good survey .",
    "one feature of @xmath23 , however , is that it is not an operad in any known way .",

    "let us briefly go through the list and history .",
    "most of the operads where actually constructed first on the combinatorial level and then realized as topological spaces , using totalizations , realizations or condensations .",
    "for the operad @xmath9 the story was the inverse .",
    "it existed first as a topological operad @xcite , and then it was realized that it is @xmath0 and it has an operadic cellular chain model @xmath444 @xcite corresponding to gv .",
    "the first operad is the kontsevich ",
    "soibelman minimal operad @xmath820 , which is the generalization of the gv operad to the @xmath821 case .",
    "it gave the first solution to deligne s conjecture and works over @xmath822 .",
    "the procedure here is a little different as the fulton ",
    "macpherson compactification and a w - construction were used .",
    "the fact that it can be realized as a version of cacti is contained in @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath821 algebra is strict , it contacts to @xmath823 , see @xcite .",
    "the next operad was by mcclure and smith @xcite and it gives a cosimplicial description of the gv  operad and hence can realize a topological operad using totalization .",
    "the current paper also fixes the homtopy type of formulas in @xcite directly .    in their second paper , mcclure and smith",
    "@xcite introduced sequence notation for the gv operad , which has been one of the most influential constructions in the theory .",
    "the sequence operad @xmath824 is with hindsight actually isomorphic to the description by b / w bi  partite trees @xcite as we recall below .",
    "the totalization of @xcite then reconstructs spineless cacti on the topological level .",
    "alternatively , @xcite used berger s machine .",
    "the operad structure of this comparison was further clarified in @xcite .",
    "the third paper @xcite contains the very fruitful functor operad approach .",
    "this gives back the usual operations if certain degeneracy maps are applied . that this procedure is also operadic follows from a more general theorem proved in @xcite[theorem 4.4 ] .",
    "the degeneracies are given as angle markings .",
    "an intermediate step to the full realization is given by partitioning , see @xcite .",
    "this provides a colored set operad structure .",
    "this was cast into a cosimplicial / simplicial picture in @xcite as the lattice path operad . here",
    "the map from @xmath825 specifies the partitioning in the sense of @xcite and is equivalent to using the foliation operator of @xcite . after doing the condensation ,",
    "one again obtains spineless cacti on the topological level .",
    "the quotient map we discuss is probably related to the surjection of @xcite , but this is not clear at the moment .",
    "what is clear is that the quotient makes the non ",
    "operad @xmath23 into an operad on the cell level and even a topological quasi ",
    "operad , i.  e.  associative up to homotopy .",
    "for the cyclic deligne conjecture , which is an application of the @xmath0 identification , the story is similar .",
    "the first proof is in @xcite using @xmath826 .",
    "the first full proof that @xmath826 are indeed equivalent to @xmath827 is in @xcite .",
    "here one uses the @xmath0 structure of spinless cacti and the fact that @xmath826 is a bi  crossed product .",
    "the paper @xcite adds the simplicial structure on the chain level explaining the usual operations as action of a colored operad .",
    "another version of this partitioning is contained in @xcite .",
    "condensation then reconstructs cacti .",
    "another chain level action was given slightly later than @xcite in @xcite .",
    "they did not , however , show that the relevant chain level operads are models for the framed little discs .",
    "so , on the topological level the operads adapted to prove the cyclic version are basically all cacti .",
    "the added difficulty , is that for cacti one is dealing with a bi  crossed product and not just a semi  direct product .",
    "the cyclic @xmath821 version again based on cacti is contained in @xcite .",
    "the isomorphism is clear from the isomorphisms @xmath828^>>>>{\\simeq}&{\\rm formulas}\\ar@{<->}[r]^>>>>{\\simeq}&gv\\ar@{<->}[r]^>>>>{\\simeq}&cc_*(cact^1)\\ar@{<->}[r]^>>>>{\\simeq}&\\mathcal{t}_{bp}^{pp , nt } } \\ ] ] contained in @xcite .",
    "this isomorphism between @xmath444 and @xmath824 is actually explicitly given in @xcite , which also contains the idea of cacti with stops , i.e.  monotone parameterizations as explained in @xcite , used by salvatore in the cyclic case , to rewrite the existing proofs in the language of mcclure  smith . given a cactus or equivalently a b / w tree , one obtains a sequence as follows .",

    "in fact , @xcite[proposition 4.11 ] actually contains a generalization to the full @xmath829 structures .",
    "here one obtains an obviously surjective map .",
    "the injectivity is clear on the @xmath0 level .",

    "it is worth pointing out that instead of making the spaces bigger by compactifying the various deformation retract models of the configuration spaces @xmath11 to get operadic structures , one can subdivide the constituent contractible pieces ( @xmath14 ) and then do further gluing to get the quasi - operad @xmath835 , which become a bona - fide operad @xmath836 after taking the semi - direct product with the scaling operad @xcite .",
    "another @xmath0 operad which is quite different from @xmath1 or @xmath2 is @xmath837 , the realization of the second term of the smith filtration of the simplicial universal bundle @xmath838 .",
