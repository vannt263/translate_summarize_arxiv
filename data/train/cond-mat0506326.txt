    "[ intro ] the movement of droplets in external gradients fascinates scientists and layman alike at least since newton s description @xcite of hauksbee s experiment with drops of orange oil that move between two non - parallel glass plates towards the point of smallest plate distance @xcite . in another example",
    "a drop of liquid freely immersed in another liquid subject to a temperature gradient will move towards the higher temperature region due to marangoni forces caused by surface tension gradients @xcite .",
    "a drop sitting on a solid substrate also moves in a temperature @xcite or wettability @xcite gradient .",
    "especially the marangoni force is already used to manipulate droplets , for example in light induced drop movement @xcite .",
    "similar concepts of a directed movement of small amounts of soft matter in a given gradient are also realized in models of cell motility @xcite",
    ".    however , even more intricate are situations where matter spontaneously starts a directed movement in initially homogeneous settings .",
    "small pieces of camphor that move on a liquid surface by emitting a surfactant have also been studied for centuries @xcite . more recently",
    "oil droplets containing volatile additives and interacting droplets of different volatile oils have been reported to move on solid surfaces due to the solutal marangoni effect caused by evaporation / condensation @xcite . also intricate",
    "is the spontaneous movement of a juxtaposed pair of droplets with different wetting properties , so called bi - slugs , along a capillary tube @xcite .",
    "this effect was already mentioned by marangoni @xcite .",
    "another example are drops immersed in a second liquid .",
    "if the drops contain a soluble surfactant undergoing an isothermal chemical reaction at their surface the drops may start to move @xcite .",
    "apart from chemical reactions , drop movement can also be driven by surface phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the movement is possible because such _ active _ drops change their surrounding and produce a gradient that drives their motion .",
    "[ sketch ]    recent experiments also found chemically driven running droplets on solid substrates @xcite . in these cases small droplets of solution are put on partially wettable substrates .",
    "a droplet changes the substrate by adsorption or desorption of a solute rendering the substrate underneath the droplet less wettable than the bare substrate .",
    "the radial symmetry still assures an equilibrium position that is , however , unstable . as a result",
    ", fluctuations break the symmetry and the drop starts to move in a self - sustained manner .",
    "in the course of its movement it changes the substrate and leaves a less wettable trail behind ( see fig.[sketch ] ) .",
    "we distinguish two types of experiments : in case  i the substrate is changed in an irreversible way whereas in case  ii it recovers its initial state after the droplet has passed .",
    "the droplet does not rest again and follows a random trajectory until trapping itself between self - produced less wettable patches ( type  i ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a running drop may perform a periodic movement ( type  ii ) @xcite .",
    "the droplet often moves with nearly constant velocity for a rather long time ( tens of minutes ) .",
    "however , in all cases the motion ceases when the overall system reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "next , we shortly recall the specific results of different sets of experiments , yielding running droplets .    in ref.@xcite droplets of @xmath0-alkanes ( @xmath0-octane and @xmath0-dodecane ) are used that contain 1,1,2,2-tetrahydroperfluorodecyltrichlorosilane ( cf@xmath1(cf@xmath2)@xmath3(ch@xmath2)@xmath2sicl@xmath1 ) .",
    "the silane molecules form dense crafted monolayers on silicon or glass and render these surfaces hydrophobic .",
    "the droplet motion is stalled when no further hydrophilic surface is available .",
    "no limitation due to silane depletion inside the droplet is observed . for millimeter",
    "sized drops ( smaller than the capillary length ) droplet velocities between 1mm / s and 10cm / s are observed , depending on liquid viscosity , silane concentration and droplet size .",
    "the velocity increases with the silane concentration and the droplet size .",
    "the reaction rate is estimated to be 1100s@xmath4mol@xmath4 .",
    "typical reaction times are given as 0.010.2s .",
    "another experiment is performed in a chemically different system @xcite using millimeter - sized droplets of a nonpolar solution of @xmath0-alkylamine ( 1 mm solution of c@xmath5nh@xmath2 or c@xmath6nh@xmath2 ) in decahydro - naphthalene ( @xmath7mj / m@xmath8 , @xmath9ns / m@xmath8 ) .",
    "therein , silicon substrates with microprinted high - energy surfaces are employed , that expose a dense packing of carboxylic acid functionalities ( co@xmath2h ) .",
    "the amines dissolved in the droplet adsorb at the substrate and produce a surface of lower energy exposing methyl groups . the effect of different adsorbates @xcite and reaction kinetics @xcite is investigated . the velocity decreases with increasing droplet size .",
    "the only example of a type  ii experiment @xcite features droplets of oil ( 5 mm iodine solution of nitrobenzene saturated with potassium iodide ) on glass substrates immersed in aqueous solution of a cationic surfactant ( 1 mm stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ) . in this system the stearyl trimethyl ammonium ion ( sta ) absorbs at the glass substrate outside the oil droplet and renders the glass lyophilic .",
    "when the oil droplet moves on top of the coating the sta desorbs into the oil . in this way",
    "a wettability contrast between front and back of the moving droplet is created and sustained .",
    "in contrast to the type  i case the substrate recovers its lyophilic state soon after the droplet has passed , because new sta absorbs at the glass . the aqueous phase can be seen as an infinite reservoir of adsorbent .",
    "movement only finally stops when the oil droplet is saturated with sta .",
    "similar phenomena can be seen in metallurgic systems where droplets of liquid metals or alloys react with the metallic substrate , for instance , by alloying .",
    "the layer between the droplet and the substrate may be less wettable than the bare substrate resulting in the migration of reactive islands .",
    "this was studied for tin islands on copper surfaces that move and leave tracks of bronze behind @xcite .",
    "contrariwise , the layer can be more wettable than the bare substrate .",
    "this is typical for the related process of reactive spreading ( also called reactive wetting ) where a droplet of liquid on a ( nearly ) non - wettable surface starts to spread after forming a more wettable layer underneath @xcite .",
    "variants are possible in which during spreading the substrate becomes less wettable in the center of the drop @xcite . however , reactive spreading processes do normally not result in running droplets ( but see the suddenly displaced droplets in ref.@xcite ) .    for type",
    "i experiments an implicit equation for the velocity @xmath10 of the droplet was derived @xcite from a simple theoretical argument .",
    "based on a balance of friction force and driving capillary forces one obtains @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the reaction rate , @xmath13 the size of the droplet and @xmath14 a constant .",
    "the dynamic contact angles at the advancing and receding ends of the droplet are then assumed to be identical ( @xmath15 ) , i.e.the droplet profile is approximated by a spherical cap with @xmath15 given by @xmath16 .",
    "the static contact angles at the advancing edge @xmath17 and at the receding edge @xmath18 are different due to the chemical gradient .",
    "the expression for the velocity is found from a first order reaction on the substrate that yields chemical concentrations @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the respective ends of the droplet .",
    "the expression for the velocity predicts a monotone increase of the droplet velocity with the droplet length @xmath13 and the reaction rate @xmath12 in line with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the droplet velocity in the limiting case of a saturated chemical reaction was also given in @xcite .",
    "however , the experiments of ref.@xcite show the opposite trend ; the velocity decreases with increasing drop sizes and effective reaction rate . in the framework of ref.@xcite the decrease",
    "is explained as a result of the flattening of the drops by gravity .",
    "related works discuss running droplets in a random medium @xcite and the forced wetting of a plate immersed into a reactive fluid @xcite .    in this paper we propose and analyze dynamical models for self - propelled running droplets for both , type  i and type  ii experiments .",
    "our models consist of coupled evolution equations for the film thickness profile and the substrate coverage .",
    "thereby the wettability of the substrate is modeled by a coverage dependent disjoining pressure .",
    "the different types of experiments are taken into account by incorporating different reaction terms .",
    "the models are capable of reproducing the different experimentally found regimes .",
    "a short account of a variant of the model for the type  i experiments , i.e.  for the case of a irreversibly changed substrate was recently presented @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the dynamic contact angles at the advancing and receding ends of the droplet are not identical but rather resemble the corresponding static ones . even for a strong driving force",
    "the deviation between dynamic and static angles is only about 10 percent .",
    "the bifurcation leading from sitting to running droplets for a finite reaction rate was identified as a drift - pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "here we analyze the type  i model in more detail and extend our analysis to the type  ii model .",
    "in section  [ model ] the type  i and type  ii dynamical models are presented .",
    "results for the two models are discussed in section  [ ad ] and [ addes ] , respectively .",
    "stationary running droplets and sitting droplets are characterized in dependence of the control parameters reaction rate , droplet volume , diffusion constant of the adsorbate field and desorption rate of the adsorbate ( for type  ii model only ) .",
    "the resulting families of solutions and their linear stability are used to derive phase diagrams that describe the existence regions for running and sitting droplets . to further elucidate the drift - pitchfork bifurcation that mediates the transition from sitting to running droplets also in the type  ii model we analyze the linear modes that destabilize sitting droplets close to the bifurcation . before we conclude in section  [ conc ] , we use numerical simulations to illustrate and analyze periodic droplet motion that is possible in the type  ii model .",
    "the simulations are compared with our continuation results and the type  ii experiment of ref.@xcite .",

    "is used that is common in the literature . in many situations",
    "the qualitative outcome only depends on very general characteristics of the disjoining pressure @xcite .",
    "the used form allows for solutions of eq.([film ] ) that represent static ( i.e.  sitting ) droplets with a finite mesoscopic equilibrium contact angle .",
    "the disjoining pressure is chosen such that the droplets coexist with an ultrathin precursor film .",

    "the second term allows for a diffusion of the chemical species along the substrate . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the adsorbate has the same diffusion constant on the bare and the droplet covered substrate .",
    "however , assuming different constants would not change the presented results qualitatively .",
    "note that for type  i experiments @xmath36 directly corresponds to the substrate coverage .",
    "however , in a type  ii experiment the droplet dissolves a more wettable coating . in this case",
    "the coverage corresponds to @xmath37 . also here",
    "one can use eq.([rd ] ) , however , the signs of adsorption and desorption term are switched . with this convention , in both cases",
    "the wettability decreases with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "one can neglect the dynamics of the concentration field of the chemical in the bulk of the droplet by assuming a fast equilibration of the solute concentration within the moving droplet as compared to the reaction at the substrate .",
    "the fast equilibration is caused by diffusion and convective motion within the droplet whereas the latter is driven by the lateral movement of the droplet along the substrate .",

    "therefore an increase in the reaction rate leads to a steeper increase in the spatial profile of the coverage underneath the droplet . in consequence a larger wettability gradient results implying a larger velocity",
    "however , again it is subtle to determine the dynamic equilibrium .",
    "first , the higher velocity reduces the contact time of the droplet with a given point of the substrate .",
    "second , it also reduces the length of the droplet ( see below ) .",

    "the coverage in the contact zone at the advancing edge does effectively not depend on @xmath12 , the increase in the advancing contact angle is caused by the larger velocity only .",
    "seeing the full dynamic contact angle at a moving contact line as a superposition of a static ( or equilibrium ) part and a dynamic part , one can say that only the dynamic part of the advancing contact angle increases with @xmath12 .",
    "the increase at the front is in line with the increase with velocity found for sliding drops on an incline ( see for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , at the receding edge the coverage in the contact zone depends strongly on @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the rather strong increase in the receding contact angle with increasing @xmath12 is caused by changes in both , the static and the dynamic part .",
    "for a larger @xmath12 the wettability at the back is smaller , i.e.  the local equilibrium contact angle increases .",
    "however , the dynamic receding contact angle normally decreases with increasing velocity @xcite .",
    "this implies that the increase in the receding angle found here results from an increase of the static part only .",

    "also in the contact angles , a relatively small @xmath109 has no visible influence in the non - saturated regime .",
    "the maximum wettability gradient , i.e.  driving force , and therefore the maximum droplet velocity is reached for the bare substrate ( @xmath41 ) at the advancing edge and maximum coverage ( @xmath43 ) at the receding edge .",
    "the point of largest velocity [ fig.[m1vrcr](a ) ] corresponds to the point of the largest difference between the receding and advancing contact angles [ fig.[m1vrcr](b ) ] .",
    "we call the corresponding reaction rate @xmath113 .",
    "next we discuss the behavior in the saturated regime ( @xmath118 in fig.[m1vrcr ] ) . for larger reaction rates",
    "the coverage at the rear of the droplet remains at its saturation value .",

    "note , that for small @xmath109 in fig.[m1vrcr](a ) this is barely visible .",
    "the decrease from @xmath113 to @xmath119 corresponds to about 2% of the maximal velocity .",
    "as detailed next this slight decay is caused by the dynamics in the advancing contact zone . in the saturated regime",
    "the time scale of the reaction is short compared to the one of the droplet movement .",
    "therefore the coverage increases very steeply underneath the droplet leading to an elevated coverage already in the advancing contact zone ( see fig.[m1prof]b ) .",
    "the resulting decrease of the overall wettability gradient felt by the droplet causes the slight decrease of the velocity . in this regime",
    "the slight increase of the advancing contact angle results from an increase of the static part ( because of the decreasing wettability ) that overcomes a decrease of the dynamic part ( decreasing velocity ) .",
    "the slight increase of the receding angle comes from the dynamic part only .",
    "we emphasize here that fig.[m1vrcr](b ) clearly shows that the advancing contact angles are always smaller than the receding ones . as was already shown in ref.@xcite also here the differences between the static and the dynamic contact angles at the front and the rear , respectively , are an order of magnitude smaller than the difference between the two static ( or the two dynamic ) contact angles .         and the diffusion constant @xmath109 .",

    "[ m1phase ]    let us finally discuss the influence of diffusion along the substrate on the dependencies shown in fig.[m1vrcr ] .",
    "the result without diffusion ( not shown ) coincides nearly perfectly with the shown curves for @xmath105 .",
    "only the decay in the saturated regime is slightly slower .",
    "we mention here that the decay also depends slightly on the used cutoff @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "eq.([xi1 ] ) and ref.@xcite ) . increasing the diffusion has a rather small influence on the non - saturated regime but changes the saturated regime even qualitatively .",
    "the velocity decreases with the reaction rate because the adsorbate produced underneath the droplet close to the advancing edge diffuses onto the bare substrate ahead of the moving droplet .",
    "this effectively reduces the wettability there , implying a slower movement .",
    "in fact , running droplets cease to exist above a reaction rate @xmath114 where the velocity drops to zero again , corresponding to a supercritical bifurcation for large diffusion ( see curve for @xmath120 ) .",
    "the bifurcation structure can , however , be more involved . for a smaller @xmath112",
    "one finds that the branch of running droplets joins the branch of sitting drops in a subcritical bifurcation at @xmath114 , i.e.  decreasing @xmath10 the running droplet branch first turns back in a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath115 and then joins the sitting droplet branch at @xmath114 .",
    "we indicate the definition of @xmath115 and @xmath114 in fig.[m1vrcr](a ) using the curve for @xmath112 as example . however , the subcritical part of the branch is difficult to see .",

    "are linearly stable and correspond to metastable states .",

    "that also implies a reduction of the overall wettability gradient .      to elucidate the mechanism of the transition between moving and sitting drops we focus for a moment on the drift - pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath114 that separates the metastable and the running droplet region",
    "this type of bifurcation is well known from reaction - diffusion ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) and hydrodynamic systems ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) , where it mediates the transition between steady and travelling structures . in our system it breaks the reflectional symmetry of the sitting droplets leading to moving asymmetric droplets and acompanying travelling asymmetric adsorbate profiles . at the bifurcation a real eigenvalue switches sign , i.e.at",

    "the bifurcation may be subcritical or supercritical ( see figs.[m1vrcr ] , [ m2vrs ] and [ m2vrd ] ) and in consequence the bifurcating branch corresponds to unstable or stable moving drops . approaching the bifurcation their respective velocity goes to zero as @xmath134 providing an unambiguous signature of the drift - pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the basic mechanism of the drift - pitchfork bifurcation is connected to the behaviour of the neutral ( or goldstone ) mode related to the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "this mode with eigenvalue zero is obtained by analyzing the linear stability of the stationary solutions . in general , each continuous symmetry is related to such a neutral mode . in a sense ,",
    "the neutral modes are the modes that are closest to zero .",
    "this implies that a perturbation or modulation of these modes in an additional degree of freedom ( if existing ) gives modes that are probable candidates to cross zero and become instability modes .",
    "for instance , the transversal ( fingering ) instability of a liquid front results from a transversal modulation of the longitudinal translational neutral mode @xcite .",
    "also one of the two coarsening modes of two liquid droplets is the combination of translational neutral modes of the individual droplets directed in opposite directions @xcite .    here",

    "this corresponds directly to the dependence on the reaction rate shown here in fig.[m1vrcr ] .    allowing for diffusion of the adsorbate along the substrate does not affect the results in the non - saturated regime too much .",
    "however , it leads to a stronger decrease of the velocity in the saturated regime because adsorbate is transported to the substrate in front of the running droplet thereby decreasing the overall wettability gradient .",
    "this may even lead to a transition towards sitting droplets .",
    "this transition occurs either continuously through a supercritical drift - pitchfork bifurcation or discontinuously through a saddle - node bifurcation . in the latter case a metastable parameter region",
    "exist where running and sitting drops can coexist .",
    "we have determined the existence regions of running droplets depending on the reaction rate , the diffusion constant in the surface coating , the droplet volume and the desorption / adsorption ratio ( only for model  ii ) .",
    "both models show a strong dependence of the existence regions of sitting and running droplets on the diffusion constant and only a week dependence on the droplet volume . the strong dependence on the diffusion constant results mainly from the diffusion of the @xmath36-field in front of the advancing droplet , thereby greatly affecting the driving force and the droplet velocity . the type  ii model also shows a strong dependence on the desorption / adsorption ratio , which is due to a decreased substrate coverage in close proximity behind the droplet , effectively decreasing the driving force .",
    "the primary effect of the desorption reaction is the possibility for the droplet to return on its own path , which we have illustrated by numerical simulations of droplets moving on a wettable stripe with non - wettable borders in an oscillatory manner , which has also been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that different modes of periodic movement called shuttling motion and intermittent shuttling motion in ref.@xcite are covered by the presented model .",
    "the analysis of both models has shown that for the chemically - driven running droplets the advancing contact angle is always smaller than the receding one . as was already shown in ref.@xcite also here",
    "the differences between the static and the dynamic contact angles at the front and the rear are one order of magnitude smaller than the difference between the two dynamic contact angles .",
    "this challenges the assumption of equal dynamic contact angles at the front and the rear that was used in ref.@xcite to develop a simple description of self - propelled running droplets .",
    "a simple quantitative theory should instead be based on the assumption that the respective dynamic contact angles equal the different static contact angles at the front and rear .",
    "the proposed type  i and type  ii model based on thin film or lubrication theory can very well reproduce the main features of droplet motion that have been observed experimentally .",
    "however , they fail to reproduce the reported damped oscillations in the droplet shape overlaying the continuous droplet movement @xcite",
    ". these oscillations could be on the one hand the result of a weakly inhomogeneous surface , since the authors of ref.@xcite themselves suggested that they have no full control of the experimental surface properties .",
    "on the other hand the oscillations could be a sign of a hopf bifurcation along the solution branch of running droplets .",
    "we are well aware that the models presented in this paper are minimal models that , however , reproduce qualitatively most aspects of the behaviour of chemically self - propelled droplets . refinements of the presented theory could include the viscous motion of the ambient medium as present in the type  ii experiments .",
    "this extension can still be based on the lubrication approximation , for instance , along the lines of the two - layer systems studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "a second important extension could cover the case of a higher damkhler number .",
    "such a model has to include a description of the transport of the solute within the droplet .",
    "[ auto ] sitting and running droplets are steady solutions in the laboratory and comoving frame , respectively .",
    "they can be followed in parameter space using numerical continuation techniques @xcite , for instance , employing the continuation software auto97 @xcite .",
    "the following section highlights some technical details of the employed techniques .",
    "the basic idea behind continuation is that unknown solutions of an algebraic system for a certain set of control parameters are obtained by iterative techniques from known solutions nearby in parameter space .",
    "differential equations of the form @xmath148 subject to initial , boundary and integral constraints are discretized in space and then the resulting algebraic system is solved iterativly . here",
    "the dash indicates the first derivative with respect to @xmath149 and @xmath150 denotes the set of control parameters .",
    "the presence of boundary conditions and/or integral conditions requires the presence of free parameters which are determined simultaneously and are part of the solution to the differential equation .",
    "the package auto97 is limited to the continuation of ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) , thus it can only be used to compute droplet solutions in two dimensions . as an example we consider the continuation of stationary running droplets , steady in a comoving frame . after transforming eqs.([sys1 ] ) and ( [ sys2 ] ) into the comoving frame with velocity @xmath10 and integrating the resulting time - independent thin - film equation we have the system of ode s @xmath151 where @xmath152 is an integration constant .",
    "it has the physical meaning of a mean flow in the comoving frame . @xmath153 ,",
    "@xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 denote @xmath75 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath36 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the dashed quantities denote first derivatives with respect to @xmath149 .",
    "the system is flux conservative , thus we need to specify the integral condition @xmath161 where @xmath13 is the system length and @xmath162 is the mean film thickness . furthermore , for a complete description of the system we introduce periodic boundary conditions for the film thickness @xmath163 and the mixed boundary conditions @xmath164\\right\\}\\times\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\left(\\phi_2(0)-\\phi_1(0)\\lambda_1\\right)\\\\ 0 & = & \\xi(h_1(0))\\lambda_2+\\left\\{\\xi(h_1(l))+s\\left[1-\\xi(h_1(l))\\right]\\right\\}\\times\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\left(\\phi_2(l)-\\phi_1(l)\\lambda_2\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath36-field ( see appendix [ boundary ] ) . since translation of a running droplet solution in the @xmath149-direction also yields a valid solution one needs to introduce a pinning condition in the form of an additional boundary or integral condition , which will not be specified further in here .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the number of boundary conditions ( nbcd ) and integral conditions ( nint ) imposes a constraint on the number of parameters ( npar ) , that have to be varied during the continuation process .",
    "specifically npar = nbcd+nint - ndim+1 , where ndim is the dimensionality of the system of ode s .",
    "this condition leaves us here with three free parameters , which are the principal continuation parameter ( e.g.the reaction rate @xmath12 ) , the mean flow @xmath152 and the droplet velocity @xmath10 .",
    "auto97 uses the method of orthogonal collocation for discretizing solutions , where the solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials with 27 collocation points per mesh interval .",
    "the mesh is adaptive as to equidistribute the discretization error .",
    "having specified the ode system in standard form with boundary and integral conditions auto97 then tries to find stationary solutions to the discretized system , by using a combination of newton and chord iterative methods .",
    "once the solution has converged auto97 proceeds along the solution branch by a small step in the parameter space defined by the free continuation parameters and restarts the iteration . + the challenge usually is , to provide auto97 with a nonuniform starting solution for the continuation . for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to start the continuation close to the point of the primary bifurcation point , where the stable uniform solution of the ode system ( [ as1])([as2 ] ) or a system similar to ( [ as1])([as2 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions undergoes a hopf - bifurcation . in the vicinity of the bifurcation",
    "one can determine analytically small - amplitude sinusoidal stationary traveling waves .",
    "by selectively using reaction , boundary or integral conditions as primary continuation parameter one finally computes fully nonlinear solutions for the film thickness and the coverage .",
    "+ auto97 is not only able to follow solution branches but can also detect bifurcations , like saddle - node bifurcation or branching points , and can then follow these bifurcations in parameter space .",
    "[ boundary ] the use of periodic boundary conditions does not rule out interactions between droplets in consecutive periods either via the film thickness or the @xmath36-field .",
    "interactions through the @xmath36-field arise if the desorption of the coating is slow compared to the drop movement .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to use very large periods , such that the @xmath36-field has enough time to recover .",
    "this approach is successful in suppressing interactions but is very costly from a computational point of view .",
    "an alternative approach is to use other than periodic boundary conditions for the @xmath36-field .",
    "the following paragraphs illustrate this approach .",
    "we generally consider a running droplet steady in a comoving frame , that has its maximum approximately in the center of the computational domain of length @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the film thickness profile obeys periodic boundary conditions @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the latter restriction ensures that the minimal film thickness is close to equilibrium and the period is large compared to the droplet .      in model",
    "i we assume that there is no chemical reaction taking place outside the droplet .",
    "therefore , outside the computational domain for @xmath167 and @xmath168 the following ordinary differential equation holds @xmath169 which has the general solution @xmath170 with @xmath171 and @xmath172 being yet undetermined constants . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath173 , i.e.the droplet is moving to the right . in front of the droplet it is assumed that @xmath174 as @xmath175 .",
    "furthermore we assume that the @xmath36-field adopts a finite value behind the droplet such that @xmath176 as @xmath177 .",
    "first we consider the boundary at @xmath178 with the boundary value for the @xmath36-field @xmath179 and the first derivative of the @xmath36-field @xmath180 . since @xmath181 is a finite value we find @xmath182 , which leads to the neumann boundary condition @xmath183 next we consider the boundary at @xmath184 with the boundary value for the @xmath36-field @xmath185 and the first derivative of the @xmath36-field @xmath186 .",
    "integrating ( [ ode1 ] ) we find @xmath187 where @xmath188 is an integration constant . since @xmath189 as @xmath175 and also @xmath190 as @xmath191",
    "we find @xmath192 , which leads us to the mixed boundary condition @xmath193      we assume for the @xmath75-field outside the computational domain with @xmath167 or @xmath168 @xmath194 .",
    "then the concentration profile for the @xmath36-field for @xmath167 or @xmath168 can be computed analytically by solving a linear 2@xmath195 order ordinary differential equation in @xmath149 of the form @xmath196 which has the general solution @xmath197 where @xmath198}\\ ] ] @xmath199\\right\\}}\\ ] ] and @xmath172 and @xmath188 are yet undetermined constants . for",
    "@xmath200 @xmath36 adopts a small but finite value @xmath181 .",

    "@xmath178 the following system of equations holds @xmath201 solving for @xmath172 one finds the following mixed boundary condition @xmath202\\right\\}\\left(\\phi_{x0}-\\phi_0\\lambda_1\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] the same procedure can be performed at the boundary @xmath184 with @xmath185 and @xmath186 yielding the condition @xmath203\\right\\}\\left(\\phi_{xl}-\\phi_l\\lambda_2\\right)\\ ] ] in the continuation algorithm",
