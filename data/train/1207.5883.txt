    "the @xmath0-body hamiltonian in @xmath3 is @xmath4 with position vectors @xmath5 and conjugate momentum vectors @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",

    "the pair - wise potential function is @xmath10 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath11    we are going to follow lagrange s footsteps @xcite , as was more recently done by albouy and chenciner @xcite , by introducing scalar products of difference vectors as new coordinates .",
    "in fact , the poisson structure we are going to derive is mentioned in @xcite , but they were mostly interested in relative equilibria , and hence only mentioned the poisson structure in passing in the final paragraph of their first section .",
    "here we are going to derive explicit expressions for the poisson structure in a particularly suitable basis and then use the poisson structure to construct a geometric integrator for the reduced 3-body problem .",
    "a related approach has been taken in @xcite , but there mainly the case of vanishing angular momentum for three bodies is considered .",
    "the poisson reduction of rotational @xmath12 symmetry has been discussed for arbitrary @xmath0 in @xcite from the point of view of singular reduction . in many ways",
    "our analysis is similar to @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that they only reduced @xmath12 symmetry , but not the euclidean or gallilean symmetry , and that in parts they only considered angular momentum zero .",
    "the general idea of poisson reduction using invariants is as follows .",
    "say we have a symmetry given as a group action @xmath13 of the group @xmath14 on a poisson manifold @xmath15 .",
    "then by definition an invariant @xmath16 satisfies @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "if for every @xmath19 the mapping @xmath13 preserves the poisson bracket , then in addition we have that for two invariants @xmath20 and @xmath19 their poisson bracket @xmath21 is also invariant under @xmath13 .",
    "reduction may be possible for a set of invariants whose poisson brackets with each other are closed , so that we can try to define a reduced poisson bracket which has the invariants as new coordinates .",
    "in general this reduced bracket may not satisfy the jacobi identity in the whole reduced space , but only on some subset defined by the syzygies between the invariants , see e.g.  @xcite , and thus it may not give a poisson bracket on the space of invariants .",
    "however , if the bracket is linear in the invariants , the so called lie - poisson case , then the jacobi identity is inherited from the lie - group structure of the brackets of the invariants .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite a setting where poisson reduction using invariants automatically reduces to the lie - poisson case is one where the invariants are quadratic forms in the original euclidean variables for which the original poisson bracket has a constant structure matrix ( e.g.  the standard symplectic matrix ) . since the bracket of two quadratic forms then again is a quadratic form the closeness then implies that the reduced bracket is lie - poisson . as we will see",
    "this is the case that occurs for the galilean symmetry of the @xmath0-body problem .",
    "poisson reduction using invariants differs significantly from symplectic reduction , as initiated by marsden and weinstein  @xcite .",
    "specifically a good review of symplectic reduction for the @xmath0-body problem is given in @xcite .",
    "translation symmetry is often reduced by introduction of so - called jacobi coordinates relative to the centre of mass .",
    "reduction by the rotational symmetry is more difficult because the rotation does not act freely .",
    "a variety of coordinate systems have been employed for this , again see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "the classical approach is the so called elimination of the nodes , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this gets down to 4 degrees of freedom , but creates a singularity for phase space points in which all position and momentum differences are collinear so that the rotational symmetry does not act freely .",
    "poisson reduction using invariants instead is well suited to handle the resulting singular reduction .    to my knowledge ,",
    "no matter what coordinates are used , the fully symplectically reduced hamiltonians have a kinetic energy that depends on the positions .",
    "using invariants for the reduction keeps the positions and momenta separate in the hamiltonian and treats all bodies equally .",
    "in particular this will enable us to construct a numerical integration schemes that preserve the poisson structure using a splitting method @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under translations in space @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 and rotations @xmath25 , @xmath23 with @xmath26 .",
    "in addition galilean boosts @xmath27 , @xmath28 leave the equations of motion invariant but _ not _ the hamiltonian .",
    "the total symmetry group is the galilean group @xmath29 where in our case we include the reflections @xmath30 .",
    "if one replaces the @xmath12 subgroup by @xmath31 the set of invariants becomes more complicated for @xmath32 , as pointed out by @xcite , see below .",
    "the galilean group also contains a generator of time translations , and invariance of the hamiltonian under this transformation leads to conservation of energy .",
    "this group element does not play a role in the following , since we do not want to reduce by this symmetry .",
    "translation invariance of the hamiltonian by noether s theorem leads to the conservation of linear momentum @xmath33 .",
    "rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian leads to the conservation of angular momentum with respect to the origin @xmath34 in general the two - form @xmath35 may be viewed as an anti - symmetric matrix , but for the special case @xmath36 it can also be identified with a vector in @xmath37 .",
    "the behaviour of the integrals @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 under translation by @xmath42 , boost by @xmath43 , rotations by @xmath44 and time translations by @xmath45 is given in the following table .",
    "we always assume that @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 the last row shows that @xmath48 and @xmath35 are constants of motion , as well as @xmath49 ( the generator of boosts ) , which implies that the centre of mass moves along a straight line with constant velocity @xmath50 .",
    "the vector integrals are not invariant under rotations but instead equivariant under rotations , as shown in the third row .",
    "none of the integrals is invariant under boosts , the additive changes are indicated in the second row .",
    "note , however , that the combination @xmath51 is invariant under boosts .",
    "this hamiltonian is the energy up to the kinetic energy in the overall translation , and @xmath52 is the hamiltonian that will be reduced later on . similarly the combination @xmath53 is invariant under translations and boosts .",
    "this is the angular momentum with respect to the centre of mass , see below .",
    "reduction by translation symmetry removes @xmath1 degrees of freedom ; the translation reduced system has @xmath54 degrees of freedom .",
    "reduction by rotational symmetry in addition removes @xmath55 degrees of freedom , since there are only @xmath55 commuting integrals when @xmath56 that can be constructed from the @xmath57 entries of the 2-form @xmath35 . when @xmath58 further reduction is possible . for general",
    "@xmath35 the fully reduced phase space has dimension @xmath59 .    when the action of the symmetry is not free singularities may arise in the reduced phase space .",
    "when the position and momentum vectors in the 3-body problem are collinear then all rotations that have this line as rotation axis leave the point in phase space fixed , so that there is non - trivial isotropy , and hence singular reduction .",
    "singularities arise similarly at points in phase space for which position and momentum vectors span a subspace whose dimension is smaller than @xmath1 and there are non - trivial rotations in @xmath3 that fix this subspace .",
    "thus for @xmath36 planar motions are not singular , but for @xmath60 planar motions lead to singular reduction .",
    "similarly for @xmath61 collinear motions are not singular .",
    "reduction by translation symmetry can be achieved by introducing a coordinate system on configuration space in which the centre of mass @xmath62 is a new coordinate together with @xmath63 relative position vectors .",
    "a popular choice for such coordinates are the jacobi coordinates , since they keep the kinetic energy diagonal , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "one disadvantage of jacobi coordinates is that they do not treat the bodies equally , which is particularly annoying when dealing with the case of equal masses .",
    "our approach preserves this discrete symmetry .",
    "as we have seen the hamiltonian is not invariant under boosts .",
    "clearly the potential energy is invariant under the full symmetry group , hence the kinetic energy is not invariant under boosts . to remedy this we split the kinetic energy into the kinetic energy of the motion of the centre of mass and the remainder denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "this relative kinetic energy @xmath64 is invariant under the full symmetry group .",
    "@xmath64 can be found by replacing @xmath65 by @xmath66 and @xmath67 by @xmath68 ( or equivalently by replacing @xmath69 by @xmath70 ) in the original kinetic energy , i.e.  by measuring positions and velocities relative to the centre of mass .",
    "thus we find the _",
    "kinetic energy relative to the centre of mass _ as @xmath71 so that @xmath72 is invariant under translations and boosts .",
    "the original hamiltonian hence is @xmath73 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath64 is obvious because both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are changed by @xmath76 under boosts @xmath77 .",
    "invariance of @xmath64 can also be verified using the table showing the effect of the @xmath29 group action on the constants of motion .",
    "in fact @xmath52 is the casimir of @xmath29 as already mentioned .",
    "measuring the total momentum relative to the centre of mass only gives zero : @xmath78 and similarly for the centre of mass @xmath79 .",
    "finally we also define the _ angular momentum about the centre of mass _ as @xmath80 invariance of @xmath81 under boosts @xmath77 is now obvious , as it was for @xmath64 .",
    "the length squared of the angular momentum relative to the centre of mass @xmath82 is hence invariant under the full @xmath29 action .",
    "what we have done here is the well known derivation of the casimirs @xmath64 and @xmath83 of the galilean group , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this prepares the system for reduction using quadratic polynomial invariants .",
    "the hilbert - weyl theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) guarantees the existence of a so called hilbert basis , i.e.  a finite set of polynomials that generate the ring of invariant polynomials for a compact group acting linearly on a vector space . by a theorem of g.  schwarz @xcite even every smooth invariant function can be expressed as a smooth function of the basic polynomial invariants . e.g.  the invariant functions @xmath64 , @xmath8 , and @xmath84 can all be written in terms of the basic polynomial invariants .",
    "the galilean group @xmath29 is not compact , and the @xmath29 action is affine instead of linear , so strictly speaking the theorem does not apply in our case .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the invariants of the @xmath29 action are quadratic functions in the original variables and that their poisson bracket is closed , i.e.  every bracket of invariants can again be expressed in terms of invariants .",
    "the invariants are introduced in two simple steps .",
    "first form difference vectors @xmath85 which are invariant under translations and boosts .",
    "notice that momentum differences are not invariant under boosts unless all masses are equal .",
    "second take scalar product of these difference vectors that are invariant under rotations as well .",
    "hence scalar products of these difference vectors are invariant under @xmath29 .",
    "since difference vectors are linear in the original coordinates , these invariants are quadratic in the original coordinates .",
    "if we would consider @xmath31 instead of @xmath12 reduction for @xmath86 there would be additional invariants given by the signs of the determinants of any @xmath1 difference vectors @xcite .",
    "the square of such a determinant , however , can again be expressed in terms of scalar products : it is the gram determinant of the @xmath1 vectors .",
    "reduction the sub - algebra of the quadratic invariants is sufficient for reduction , even though it is not a hilbert basis . ]",
    "there are @xmath87 non - zero difference vectors between @xmath65 , similarly for @xmath88 , but only @xmath63 of each group are independent .",
    "a possible choice of basis difference vectors are the @xmath89 vectors @xmath90 , @xmath91 , similarly for any other fixed first ( or second ) index .",
    "the elements of this vector space are invariant under translations and boosts .",
    "now we have reduced the non - compact part of @xmath29 by introducing difference vectors . in the next step",
    "we introduce invariants based on these differences vectors that are @xmath31 invariant : any scalar product between two vectors from the space of difference vectors is invariant under @xmath31 , and hence invariant under the full symmetry group .",
    "the basis of the space of difference vectors has dimension @xmath92 , and forming all pairs there are @xmath93 fully invariant scalar products .",
    "we will later formally show that this number is the dimension of the vector space of quadratic invariants , which is isomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath2 , see theorem  [ thm : spfin ] .",
    "all the scalar products between the basic difference vectors can be conveniently combined in a gram matrix .",
    "instead of taking the entries of the gram matrix as invariants we will choose certain linear combinations that are more natural because they appear in the reduced hamiltonian .",
    "in particular the potential depends on the @xmath87 mutual distances @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 where the second equality holds for the gravitational @xmath0-body problem .",
    "the full kinetic energy of the hamiltonian can _ not _ be written in terms of the invariants because it is not invariant under boosts .",
    "however , the kinetic energy _ relative to the centre of mass _ @xmath64 is invariant and can be rewritten in terms of the @xmath87 relative speeds @xmath97 , @xmath95 as @xmath98 the terms of the form @xmath99 cancel since they appear in both sums , and the remaining @xmath100 terms from the first sum recombine with the @xmath87 of the second sum to give the result .    similarly the angular momentum relative to the centre of mass can be written in terms of difference vectors using the identity @xmath101 and its time derivative , so that @xmath102 to construct an invariant from the equivariant @xmath81 we compute the length squared of this vector .",
    "the identity @xmath103 then shows that @xmath82 can be written in terms of invariants . where @xmath104 is an antisymmetric rank 2 matrix ( @xmath105 ) the scalar product between two such matrices @xmath106 and @xmath77 is given by @xmath107 , and the lagrange identity still holds . ] in this expansion of total angular momentum in terms of invariants not only @xmath108 and @xmath109 appear , but also scalar products between @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "exactly which scalar products to choose as a basis of the vector space of quadratic invariants we leave open until section  [ sec : basispoi ] where the structure matrix of the reduced poisson bracket is computed in a certain basis .",
    "until then we work in a basis - independent formulation .",
    "the moment of inertia with respect to the centre of mass can be similarly expressed as @xmath112    we will show ( see theorem  [ thm : spfin ] ) that the dimension of the space of quadratic invariants is @xmath113 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this number is given in the column denoted by @xmath114 in the following tables .",
    "in the subsequent columns of the first table the dimension @xmath115 of the translation reduced @xmath0-body problem in dimension @xmath1 is given for @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 in the second table the dimensions of the fully reduced @xmath0-body problem are given .",
    "it should be noted , however , that symplectic reduction in this case leads to 1 ) a singular reduced space and 2 ) equations which can not be integrated using splitting methods .",
    "the full reduction by @xmath12 removes another @xmath118 dimensions ( since there are only @xmath55 commuting integrals , even though the number of integrals grows quadratically with @xmath1).-body problem in dimension @xmath36 there are 10 independent first integrals . from the point of view of reduction",
    "this counting is unusual for two reasons : 1 ) the hamiltonian is counted , and 2 ) the three angular momenta are counted even though they do not commute , and hence can not be used to lower the number of degrees of freedom by @xmath1 . ]",
    "whichever counting is used , the tables show that the method presented here is efficient only when @xmath119 and @xmath120 , unless unusually high dimensions @xmath60 are considered .",
    "the number of @xmath29 invariants grows quadratically with @xmath0 , and hence there must be more and more casimirs relating these invariants .",
    "the principal strengths of the current approach are that 1 ) poisson reduction using invariants has no problem with singular reduction , 2 ) it is naturally independent of the dimension @xmath1 , and 3 ) it preserves the simple form of the hamiltonian @xmath52 which allows a splitting integrator to be constructed .",
    "let us finally comment on the dimension of the so called shape space and its relation to the dimension of the fully reduced phase space",
    ". for @xmath36 the dimension of shape space is @xmath121 , namely the dimension of the configurations space of @xmath0 points in @xmath37 up to translations and rotations .",
    "this gives dimension 3 for @xmath119 , namely the number of sides of a triangle .",
    "but the reduced system has 4 degrees of freedom , dimension 8 , as listed in the the second table .",
    "the additional degree of freedom describes the ( fixed ) angular momentum vector in a body frame attached to the plane of the triangle , i.e.  it describes the position of a point on a sphere , which is the co - adjoint orbit of @xmath122 .",
    "the rotation of this plane about the axis of the angular momentum vector is obtained by reconstruction .",
    "the canonical variables @xmath123 satisfy the poisson bracket @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 . a second index outside parenthesis",
    "denotes the component of a vector , not to be confused with the double index without parenthesis @xmath110 for the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath127 .    since the velocities are more important than the momenta in our construction it is useful to pass to a new non - standard symplectic structure in which the momenta are replaced by velocities as variables .",
    "this is a non - canonical transformation that changes the symplectic structure .",
    "it introduces scalar factors originating from @xmath128 .",
    "thus the usual identity block - matrices in the standard symplectic structure are replaced by diagonal matrices with entries @xmath129 .    to verify that the equations of motion separate into the centre of mass motion and the non - trivial part described by invariants we need to show that the poisson bracket between any quadratic invariant and the centre of mass and its derivative ( the linear momentum ) vanishes .",
    "clearly @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "now verify that @xmath132 , similarly @xmath133 .",
    "finally @xmath134 , and similarly @xmath135 .",
    "thus when we write down the equations of motion generated by @xmath136 we recover the trivial equation @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "more importantly the equations of motion for the invariants are determined by @xmath52 only . e.g.  for @xmath139 the equation of motion is @xmath140 , and similarly for all other invariants .",
    "thus from now on @xmath52 is our hamiltonian , and the main task is to compute the poisson bracket between invariants and express them in terms of invariants .",
    "before we proceed to the general case we briefly treat @xmath141 where everything can be done by direct computation . as a basis for the three invariants we choose @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "the relative kinetic energy is @xmath145 , where the reduced mass @xmath146 is given by @xmath147 .",
    "the relative momentum is @xmath148 .",
    "the reduced relative hamiltonian is @xmath149 the poisson brackets between the new variables @xmath150 can be found by direct computation , e.g.@xmath151 where we have used a 2nd index outside parenthesis to denote the components of a vector .",
    "notice that the bracket is independent of the spatial dimension @xmath1 .",
    "thus the non - vanishing brackets are @xmath152 so that the bracket between the invariants is closed , i.e.  all brackets of invariants can be expressed in terms of invariants .",
    "the structure matrix @xmath77 of the new poisson bracket is @xmath153 it is easy to check that this poisson bracket satisfies the jacobi identity , but this is also automatic since it is linear , i.e. it is a lie - poisson bracket .",
    "in fact it is the lie - poisson bracket of @xmath154 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "as expected @xmath82 is a casimir of the bracket .",
    "this casimir can also be interpreted as the gram determinant of the matrix that has the difference vectors @xmath155 as columns .",
    "the generic symplectic leaf @xmath156 for @xmath157 is one sheet ( since @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) of a two - sheeted hyperboloid .",
    "the surface define by @xmath160 in the reduced space is a cylinder in the @xmath161 direction over a hyperbola in @xmath162 . for large negative @xmath163",
    "there is no intersection between the two surfaces .",
    "the first tangency corresponds to the circular orbit .",
    "the intersection is topologically a circle until @xmath163 reaches zero . for positive",
    "@xmath163 the intersection is an unbounded line corresponding to a scattering solution of the kepler problem .",
    "when the casimir is zero the symplectic leaf is a cone so that the reduced phase space is singular .",
    "we now describe this case .",
    "the vertex of the cone is not accessible for finite energy .",
    "the collision corresponds to the infinite point on the positive @xmath164 axis .",
    "all intersection curves asymptote towards this point . for positive energy",
    "there are two unbounded lines meeting in the collision . for negative energy",
    "the intersections form a tear drop with a turning point at finite @xmath165 .",
    "we now derive the reduced poisson bracket between the invariants for general @xmath0 and without choosing a particular basis of invariants .",
    "each invariant is quadratic in the original variables .",
    "the standard symplectic poisson bracket of two quadratic functions yields a quadratic function in the same variables .",
    "the set of all quadratic functions thus is a sub - algebra of all functions .",
    "the main observation is that the poisson bracket of the invariants is closed , i.e.  brackets of invariants can be written in terms of the invariants again .",
    "this means there is a smaller sub - algebra of invariant quadratic functions within the algebra of quadratic functions . from an abstract point of view",
    "this follows as soon as it has been established that the quadratic invariants contain a hilbert basis . instead of assuming this in the following",
    "we directly show that the quadratic invariants form a sub - algebra .",
    "verifying this reduces to linear algebra : each invariant is a certain quadratic form and together they form a vector space .",
    "the set of all quadratic forms ( which can be identified with the space of all symmetric matrices ) becomes an algebra under the poisson bracket .",
    "because the invariants are quadratic the resulting poisson structure will in fact be a lie - poisson structure , where the entries of the poisson structure matrix are linear in the invariants and the linear combinations are given by the structure constants of some lie algebra .    the next lemma is well known , see , e.g. , @xcite , and we will adapt it for our particular case in the following .",

    "instead we look for ( discrete ) period @xmath0 orbits for fixed step size @xmath163 of the integrator ( and hence fixed period @xmath468 in the continuum limit ) . because of the scaling symmetry the step size can be arbitrarily fixed .    the figure 8 choreography can be discretised with 18 steps only , see figure  1 . period",
    "18 amounts to only 3 iterates after factoring out the discrete @xmath469 symmetry ( see @xcite ) in reduced space .",
    "with such a huge stepsize relative to the period @xmath470 it is not obvious how to identify the discretised figure 8 orbit .",
    "the precise claim is that there exits a period 18 orbit of @xmath464 that has the same discrete symmetries as the figure 8 , is linearly stable , and roughly follows the shape of the figure 8 . for comparison a figure 8 discretised with 150 steps",
    "is also shown in figure  1 .",
    "periodic orbits of @xmath464 with period 6 or 12 with the correct symmetry do exist , but they are not elliptic . starting with the collinear configuration , the discrete symmetry forces the initial condition to be of the form @xmath471 , and imposing @xmath472 in addition gives @xmath473 and @xmath474 so that there are only 3 parameters for orbits with this symmetry . trying to find a symmetric period @xmath475 solution requires that the @xmath172th iterate of this initial condition is at the isosceles configuration of the form @xmath476 , @xmath477 , @xmath478 , @xmath479 .",

    "the typical behaviour of poisson integrators is found that preserves the casimirs essentially to machine precession while the hamiltonian has larger fluctuations but no drift.,width=604 ]    the period @xmath481 orbit of @xmath464 is given by @xmath482 , @xmath483 , and @xmath484 for @xmath485 , @xmath470 .",
    "the period @xmath486 orbit of @xmath464 with stepsize @xmath487 converges to a phase space point on the figure 8 orbit of the continuous system with period @xmath470 and coordinates @xmath488 , @xmath489 , @xmath490 .",
    "the corresponding value of the hamiltonian is @xmath491 .",
    "this orbit for @xmath492 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "note that in full space this corresponds to only half of the figure 8 . in order to illustrate the properties of the poisson integrator figure  2 shows the casimirs and the energy over 25 rounds of the figure 8 .",
    "instead of scaling the stepsize with @xmath172 we can also fix it at say @xmath493 and scale the initial conditions with @xmath172 .",
    "then we obtain the statement that the map @xmath494 has a family of periodic orbits of period @xmath475 for which @xmath495 , @xmath496 , @xmath497 for large @xmath172 .",
