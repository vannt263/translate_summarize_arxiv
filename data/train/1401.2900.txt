    "tree - based algorithms for option pricing are studied since the seminal work of ( ) and turn out to be very simple and fast to be implemented by a backward induction .",
    "an important characteristic which makes these procedures very appealing is that they easily include american - style features once the european case is treated and well setup .",
    "this makes lattice techniques widely used in the practice because although many progresses have been done in the development of exact formulas or other numerical procedures ( monte carlo , finite differences , etc . ) for european option prices , the american counterparts , that involve a control problem , are not so well - provided .",
    "we consider here the black and scholes model , see ( ) and ( ) , which is either classical and still widely used in finance .",
    "it means that the underlying asset price process evolves as a geometric brownian motion . here",
    ", option prices can be computed by using the simple tree method due to ( ) ( crr ) .",
    "however financial derivatives have been becoming more and more sophisticated and this means that the standard implementation of the crr binomial tree brings to further errors in the approximation of the black and scholes prices .",
    "this is the reason why it becomes important to setup `` efficient tree schemes '' , i.e. tree methods which allow one to reduce the approximation errors .",
    "+ we propose here a lattice scheme for pricing digital barrier options .",
    "in particular a digital call option is an option whose payoff is equal to a fixed amount ( in what follows we suppose this amount is equal to @xmath0 ) if the underlying asset at maturity is greater than a predetermined level ( the strike price @xmath1 ) or nothing otherwise .",
    "practitioners that trade these products essentially predict the direction of the market without concerning in the specific the magnitude of the movements of the underlying asset price .",
    "one of the benefits with respect to standard products is that the investment and the returns are fixed , so the risk involved and the potential losses are known a priori .",
    "digital options can also include barrier levels : they can be activated or nullified if the underlying asset price process reaches certain contractually specified levels .",
    "this more complex option can be used as a financial tool embedded in sophisticated products , such as accrual range notes .",
    "these notes are financial securities that are linked for example to a foreign exchange rate and then they pay a fixed interest accrual if the exchange rate remains within a specified range and nothing otherwise , see ( ) and also ( ) .",
    "+ european digital options with barrier features have a known closed - form pricing formula both for a single barrier and for double barriers that can be easily derived from the corresponding formulas in the standard case , for the latter ones we can refer for instance to ( ) in the single barrier case and ( ) in the double barrier case . as far as we know , the literature of american exotic options suggests no approximation formulas for digital barrier options .",
    "our objective is then to treat the option pricing problem related to these options by using lattice techniques .",
    "in particular we propose an efficient method for the pricing of european digital call options with a single barrier and then , consequently , we also get a good method for the case of american - style options .",
    "+ to this end , we first need to find an explicit asymptotic expansion of the classical crr binomial approximation error , that is the difference between the price computed with the crr tree and the black and scholes price",
    ". then we setup an algorithm such that it behaves `` well '' , in the sense that the worst contribution in the asymptotic expansion ( which turns out to be of order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of time steps of the tree ) is nullified .",
    "+ it is well known that the rate of convergence of the crr tree for vanilla options on continuous payoff functions is of order @xmath4 , see for example ( ) , ( ) and ( ) .",
    "moreover the results known from the literature when dealing with barrier options always require the continuity on the payoff function . for double barrier options on a general class of continuous payoff functions we can refer to ( ) and in the more specific case of call options to ( ) .",
    "we recall that here the rate of convergence is of order @xmath2 and this is due to the fact that the contractual barriers do not necessarily coincide with the effective barriers on the tree structure . on the other hand when the payoff is assumed to be discontinuous",
    "the analysis of the rate of convergence of the binomial algorithm is given only for vanilla options , see ( ) and ( ) . also in this case the rate of convergence is of order @xmath2 , but now it is caused by the position of the discontinuity points of the payoff functions on the lattice .",
    "+ in this framework we treat the study of the crr binomial approximation error in the case of digital options with a single barrier and we get a complete theoretical result that allows us to construct an efficient algorithm . in particular we fit the binomial interpolated lattice ( bil ) algorithm provided in ( ) to this specific case .",
    "we recall that the bil procedure is based on a backward induction on a binomial mesh with additionally suitable interpolations that allows one to get very precise option prices for call and put double barrier options .",
    "we adapt this procedure to the case of digital call and put options with a single barrier and the numerical results show that we get very reliable and accurate option prices . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect - model ]",
    "we describe the continuous - time model for the evolution of the underlying asset price process . in section [ sect - theory ] we propose our theoretical contribution on the asymptotic expansion of the crr approximation error for european digital options with barrier features .",
    "the numerical results are shown in section [ sect - numerics ] .",
    "we consider a market model in the time interval @xmath5 $ ] where the evolution of the risky asset @xmath6}$ ] is governed by the black - scholes stochastic differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8}$ ] is a standard brownian motion under the risk neutral probability measure .",
    "the non - negative constant @xmath9 is the risk - free interest rate and @xmath10 is the constant volatility parameter . +",
    "a digital call barrier option is a contract whose payoff is equal to @xmath0 if the underlying asset price at maturity is greater than the strike price @xmath1 , and nothing otherwise .",
    "moreover , the payoff also depends on whether the underlying stock price path ever touches certain price levels called barriers .",
    "once either of these barriers is breached , the status of the option is immediately determined : either the option comes into existence if the barrier is a knock - and - in type or it ceases to exist if the barrier is a knock - and - out type . in what follows",
    "we will consider the knock - and - out type , the knock - and - in type being similar .",
    "+ we recall that the payoff of a digital call option with lower barrier @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 } s_t$ ] . the case of a digital call option with higher barrier @xmath14 is similar , as well as the case of the corresponding digital put options with a single barrier .",
    "+ the black and scholes prices of european options whose payoff is equal to the one given in ( [ payoff - single ] ) can be found in ( ) .",
    "no analytical approximations are available for option prices when the payoff is as in ( [ payoff - single ] ) in the american case .",
    "starting from the model described in section [ sect - model ] , we analyze here the error committed by using the crr tree method for pricing european digital call options with a single barrier .",
    "if @xmath3 denotes the number of time steps of the tree , we define the crr binomial approximation error as follows @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the price calculated by using the crr tree scheme and @xmath17 is the black and scholes price .",
    "+ we briefly recall here the idea of the crr tree scheme .",
    "let us fix an integer @xmath3 .",
    "we first define @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the maturity of the option , and then we build a binomial tree with @xmath20 steps of length @xmath21 . if we label @xmath22 the starting node that corresponds to the value @xmath23 , then after @xmath24 time steps ( @xmath25 ) , the discrete process may be located at one of the nodes @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) corresponding to the values @xmath28 hence , starting from @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , the process may jump at time @xmath31 to the value @xmath32 or the value @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath34 is defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "european and american prices at time @xmath38 are then obtained by applying the classical backward induction .",
    "+    we now develop some argumentations described in ( ) and ( ) .",
    "we consider the case of a digital call option with a lower barrier @xmath11 , the other cases of digital options with a single barrier being similar .",
    "the idea is to find a closed - form formula in terms of binomial coefficients of the option price following ( ) and then use the approximation of the binomial distribution by the normal one as suggested in ( ) in order to find explicit coefficients in the asymptotic expansion .",
    "we first stress that we need the binomial prices of digital call options with lower barrier @xmath11 of the two following types :    1 .   a down - and - in call option with @xmath39 ; 2 .   a down - and - out call option with @xmath40 .    in these two cases",
    "the binomial formulas are manageable and permits a simple treatment .",
    "then , by using the binomial formulas for the corresponding vanilla digital call option , it is possible to find the asymptotic expansion of the error for a down - and - out digital call option with @xmath39 and a down - and - in digital call option with @xmath40 .",
    "+ let us first introduce two quantities , that will have a crucial role in what follows , as defined in ( ) and ( ) , that we call @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "the true price is calculated by using the black and scholes formula given in ( [ bs2 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical proof that the rate of convergence of the adjusted bil algorithm is of order @xmath4 is a direct consequence of proposition 1 in ( ) , theorem [ digital-1 ] and theorem [ digital-2 ] .",
    "in fact , in the adjusted bil algorithm we get the price in @xmath148 by suitable interpolations of some selected crr prices at times @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as in the standard version of the bil algorithm ( see figure [ intr - griglia ] ) .",
    "but the interpolation rule preserves the error committed by approximating the continuous - time prices at the selected nodes by the crr ones .",
