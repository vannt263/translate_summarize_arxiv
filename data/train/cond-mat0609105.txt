    "an electron - nuclear spin coupling substantially affects electron spin dynamics in solids .",
    "this phenomenon is broadly utilized in epr probing of material structures.@xcite however , for novel technological applications of electron spins @xcite it produces a major obstacle even at low temperatures when effects of phonons are suppressed.@xcite in particular , it is crucial for a quantum coherence that is a key issue of a quantum computation.@xcite entanglement of an electron spin with a nuclear spin bath results in an irreversible loss of coherence . unlike spin relaxation ,",
    "@xcite decoherence process is not suppressed even in strong magnetic fields .",

    "connexion theoretical models of electron - nuclear spin dynamics can provide better understanding of electron spin decoherence processes and also help in estimating the effectiveness of coherence control schemes .    in this work",
    "we investigate dynamics of a localized electron spin interacting with a nuclear spin bath at a low temperature regime .",
    "we chose a system with a long spin relaxation time that is of interest to quantum computing .",
    "until recently , this problem has been studied using stochastic models of spectral diffusion . @xcite",
    "their results were verified by numerous experiments carried out on macroscopic samples .",
    "recently , emphasis of experimental and theoretical studies has been shifted to dynamics of single quantum systems , where stochastic models are inappropriate .",
    "several analytical and numerical approaches based on quantum dynamics have been developed and used to investigate different aspects of the problem .",
    "@xcite among the issues addressed in these studies are spin relaxation at low external fields , @xcite effects of nuclear spin polarization on electron spin dynamics , @xcite dynamical control for spin decoherence , @xcite contributions of high order nuclear spin correlations into an electron spin echo , @xcite etc .",

    "how does one characterize short time qubit evolution ?",
    "@xcite what are the reversible and irreversible parts of spin dynamics ?",
    "@xcite what are the relative contributions of different correlated nuclear spin clusters in electron spin dynamics ?",
    "how do nuclear spin correlations grow in time ?",
    "@xcite    here , we demonstrate that diagram techniques developed previously in studies of heisenberg ferromagnets @xcite can be applied to evaluate effects of a nuclear spin bath on a single electron spin in a high field regime .",
    "our theoretical approach provides a transparent representation of different nuclear spin dynamical processes contributing to an electron spin evolution .",
    "it naturally accounts for nuclear spin excitations beyond pair correlation models .",
    "we show that transverse evolution of an electron spin can be factorized to a precession in a nuclear overhauser field and more complex dynamics due to electron - nuclear spin entanglement.@xcite a conventional hahn echo experiment cancels the phase due to precession in the nuclear field and also suppresses entanglement with the nuclear bath . as an illustration , we consider dynamics of an electron spin localized at phosphorous donor impurity in a si crystal .",
    "we estimate contributions of 2 , 3 and 4 nuclear spin excitations to electron spin decoherence and discuss effects of hahn echo on spin decoherence .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe a hamiltonian and discuss assumptions used .",
    "section  [ lcesec ] is devoted to diagrammatic representation of the decoherence process . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the approach and consider an example of p donor electron spin in a si crystal .",
    "section  [ concl ] gives the conclusion . in appendix",
    "[ a ] we provide the spin diagrammatic rules , in appendix  [ b ] we discuss some specific properties of the linked cluster expansion for spin systems and in appendix  [ c ] we give explicit analytical expressions of some high order nuclear spin contributions to electron spin dynamics .",
    "we consider the spin of a single electron localized in a quantum dot or bounded by a donor impurity .",
    "we assume that only one type of nuclear spins with @xmath0 is presented , though this assumption can be relaxed within the approach used . in a strong external magnetic field",
    "the hamiltonian for a single electron spin coupled by the contact hyperfine interaction @xcite with a system of nuclei can be written as    @xmath1    0.06 true in a similar hamiltonian has been used in previous studies of the spectral diffusion problem .",
    "@xcite here , we briefly describe the notations and assumptions .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) account for electron and nuclear zeeman energy level splittings in an external field , @xmath2 , with the larmor frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "z_-axis is chosen along the magnetic field .",
    "the third and fourth terms originate from the contact hyperfine interaction . in a strong magnetic field",
    "direct electron - nuclear flip - flop transitions , @xmath5 , are forbidden by the energy conservation law .",
    "therefore , beside a small visibility loss , @xcite this part of the contact interaction contributes to the effective coupling between nuclear spins only .",
    "@xcite the coupling coefficients are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are free and effective electron g - factors , @xmath10 is a bohr magneton , @xmath11 is a nuclear @xmath11-factor and @xmath12 is an electron wave function at a position of @xmath13-th nuclear spin . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ hamilt ] ) represents the secular part of the nuclear spin dipole - dipole interaction . for the electron nuclear hyperfine interaction ,",
    "we consider here only the isotropic contact part .",
    "effects of the dipolar e - n hyperfine interaction , resulting in spin echo envelope modulation , @xcite has been discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt ] ) is diagonal in the electron spin .",
    "therefore , the nuclear spin bath affects transverse electron spin dynamics only .",
    "the initial state of the electron spin plus the system of nuclear spins is described by the density matrix @xmath14 at the time moment , @xmath15 , when the electron spin state has been prepared .",
    "two assumptions are applied to @xmath14 .",
    "first , we use the standard approximation of a factorized system and bath,@xcite @xmath16 .",
    "the electron spin is initially prepared in the pure state , @xmath17 , e.g. , by a @xmath18 pulse .",
    "the second assumption is that the nuclear spin system is in a pure state that is an eigenstate of @xmath19 operator . with the latter statement we neglect by nuclear spin - spin correlations at @xmath20 .",
    "influence of different initial states of nuclear bath on electron spin evolution has been discussed in refs .  and",
    "though the lack of nuclear spin - spin interaction in these papers may affect their conclusions .",
    "it has been argued that the pure spin state utilized here can be useful for quantum computation purposes because it does not destroy electron spin coherence at short timescales .",
    "after statistical averaging over possible initial configurations the nuclear spin density matrix is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a statistical weight of a given nuclear configuration @xmath23 .    the evolution of the up - down component ( @xmath24 ) of an electron spin density matrix can be written as @xcite    @xmath25    0.06 true in where    @xmath26    0.06 true in    0.06 true in here , we used the fact that the hamiltonian  ( [ hamilt ] ) commutes with @xmath27 and projected it to the electron spin - up ( @xmath28 ) and spin - down ( @xmath29 ) subspaces .",

    "if the nuclear larmor frequency , @xmath32 , varies from a site to site due to inhomogeneity of the external field or other factors then its fluctuating part should be included into @xmath30 .",
    "below , we will keep the superscript indexes , ( hf ) and ( dd ) , in the coupling constants only if it is not clear from the context what type of interaction is used .    using the relations    @xmath33    0.06 true in where @xmath34 is a time ordering operator , and our assumption on the initial nuclear spin density matrix , eq .",

    "ensemble results are obtained by taking statistical average of all possible initial configurations .",
    "dynamics of each distinct configuration of spins in a cluster , in general , should be depicted by a different diagram specifying an initial spin configuration and the time arrow as it is shown in fig .",
    "however , in many cases analytical expressions for these configurations can be transformed to each other , as is discussed in appendix  [ a ] . to reduce the number of diagrams , in the figures we omit the configuration dependence , assuming that one diagram represents all possible configurations . in analytical and numerical evaluations",
    "we calculate contributions of distinct spin clusters .",
    "we also drop the time arrow for simplicity .    to evaluate diagrams given in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] we use a @xmath56 matrix ( matrix elements indexing branches , fig .",
