    "however , still a lot of questions remain open even in the tridiagonal case . in particular , the spectrum of most tridiagonal random operators is yet unknown . although the techniques used here are possibly also suited for more general types of operators , we focus on the feinberg - zee random hopping matrix @xcite here . it is defined as follows : @xmath0 for a random sequence @xmath1 , i.e. a sequence with randomly ( i.i.d . ) distributed entries .",
    "similarly we define @xmath2 for arbitrary sequences @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath4 of @xmath5 is independent of the sequence @xmath6 in the following sense :    ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 , theorem 2.5 ) ) for a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath7 taking values in @xmath8 with non - zero probability each , the spectrum of @xmath5 is given by @xmath9 almost surely .    in @xcite chandler - wilde , chonchaiya and",
    "lindner discovered a beautiful connection to the sierpinski triangle .",
    "this connection was then used to show that the unit disk is contained in @xmath10 , which disproved earlier conjectures that @xmath10 may be of fractal dimension . in @xcite",
    "the same authors also gave an upper bound using the numerical range .",
    "this upper bound was further improved in @xcite .",
    "an image of @xmath10 ( or more precisely : what it is conjectured to be ) and the upper bounds computed in @xcite and @xcite are provided in figure 1 .",
    "another way of deriving lower bounds is using equation directly .",
    "the spectra of many operators on the right hand side can be computed explicitly .",
    "this is in particular the case for periodic operators .",
    "we call an operator @xmath11 ( not necessarily tridiagonal ) @xmath12-periodic if @xmath13 for all @xmath14 . in the tridiagonal case",
    ", we will also use the notation @xmath15 for @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 note that @xmath18 is not unique because @xmath19 and @xmath20 define the same operator .",
    "we will make use of this fact later on .",
    "the good thing about periodic operators is that they can be diagonalized in some sense .",

    "* theorem 4.4.9 ) ) + let @xmath21 , let @xmath11 be an @xmath12-periodic operator and define @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 is unitarily equivalent to the ( generalized ) multiplication operator @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath27 is called the symbol of @xmath25 and given by @xmath28 moreover , @xmath29 .    in the following",
    ", we will always have a finite number of non - vanishing coefficients @xmath30 .",
    "thus we will not have to worry about the convergence of @xmath31 .",
    "proposition [ thmd ] enables us to compute the spectra of periodic operators explicitly ( numerically ) .",
    "we call the set @xmath32 the periodic part of @xmath10 .",
    "another related set is the set of eigenvalues of finite matrices of this kind . for @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "we define @xmath35 then we call the set @xmath36 the finite part of @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear by equation that @xmath37 is a subset of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath38 holds .",
    "it was then conjectured in @xcite that @xmath39 and that @xmath10 is a simply connected set which is the closure of its interior and which has a fractal boundary . that the first equality holds was recently shown in @xcite whereas the second equality and the other assertions remain open .",
    "some light was shed on this question in @xcite , where it was proved that @xmath40 .",
    "combined with the result of @xcite and equation , this implies @xmath41 the result of chandler - wilde and davies in @xcite is based on the observation that @xmath37 ( and also @xmath10 ) is invariant under taking square roots , i.e. @xmath42 in this paper we extend this result to an infinite number of symmetries .",
    "we prove that for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an infinite set of polynomials made precise below , the following holds : @xmath45 in other words , @xmath37 ( and hence also @xmath46 ) is invariant under taking roots of polynomials @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that can be extended to @xmath47 for all @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath48 this improvement in comparison with is significant as figure 2 shows .",
    "clearly , this construction can also be iterated , i.e. @xmath49 and hence @xmath50 this implies that @xmath10 contains an infinite sequence of ( presumably filled ) julia sets ( see remark [ remark ] below ) , e.g. the set indicated in figure 3 .",
    "these two approaches can also be combined as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be the closure of @xmath44 with respect to composition , i.e. @xmath52 then @xmath53 in this way one can construct even more julia sets that are contained in @xmath10 .",
    "this richness of symmetries might be a part of an explanation of the seemingly fractal boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "surely , this observation needs further investigation .",
    "note that in @xcite it was also shown that @xmath54 here we only have the ( possibly weaker ) statement @xmath55 for @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to the polynomial symmetries mentioned above , there are also the following symmetries ( see ( * ? ? ? * lemma 3.4 ) ) : @xmath56    we start with some well - known preparatory results and end up with the two main theorems of this paper . a short list of polynomials in @xmath44 and selected pictures of new subsets of @xmath10 are provided at the end .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath16 . then we denote the corresponding @xmath12-periodic operator @xmath57 by @xmath15 . by proposition [ thmd ] , we can use the symbol @xmath58 to compute the spectrum of @xmath15 . in our case , due to tridiagonality",
    ", the formula can be simplified as follows .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath21 , @xmath16 and let @xmath58 denote the symbol of @xmath15 .",

    "the polynomial @xmath64 is monic and given by @xmath65 furthermore , @xmath64 is an even ( odd ) function if @xmath12 is even ( odd ) .",
    "the most important part of lemma [ lemma1 ] is that there are no mixed terms of @xmath68 and @xmath59 in equation .",
    "this leads to the fact ( see corollary [ cor1 ] below ) that the spectrum of every periodic operator @xmath15 can be written as the preimage of the interval @xmath69 $ ] under some polynomial @xmath64 . in this way the various parts of @xmath37 are connected .",
    "we will make great use of this fact in theorem [ thm2 ] . but first observe the following .",
    "the term in involving @xmath59 can be simplified to @xmath70 or @xmath71 depending on the product @xmath72 . to avoid unnecessary paperwork , we give the following definition .      note",
    "that we can always assume that a periodic operator @xmath15 has an even period @xmath18 .",
    "this is because we can always double the period , i.e. take @xmath75 instead of @xmath19 as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "[ prop1 ] let @xmath21 , @xmath16 and let @xmath64 be the corresponding polynomial given by lemma [ lemma1 ] .",

    "the difference is that , depending on the sequence @xmath6 , the entries @xmath109 and @xmath110 are swapped for some @xmath23 . for @xmath111",

    "* lemma 5 ) .",
    "first we will prove the following claim by induction :      for @xmath118 we have @xmath119 for @xmath120 , @xmath115 , and @xmath121 for @xmath115 .",
    "all other entries are @xmath84 .",
    "so assume that the claim holds for @xmath122 .",

    "observe that @xmath126 is contained in @xmath127 for all @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "thus @xmath112 only depends on the coefficients @xmath113 for all @xmath115 , @xmath116 . plugging @xmath128 into yields @xmath117 for all @xmath115 by the same induction argument .",
    "plugging in @xmath129 and @xmath130 shows that all other entries are @xmath84 .",
    "this finishes the proof of the claim .    using claim 1 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath23 , we get that @xmath133 only depends on the coefficients @xmath134 for all @xmath135 , @xmath136 and all other entries in row @xmath137 are @xmath84 .",

    "moreover , claim 1 also implies that the same is true for @xmath140 because @xmath64 is an even / odd monic polynomial of degree @xmath12 by lemma [ lemma1 ] .",
    "this again follows easily by induction : @xmath142 since @xmath143 for all @xmath144 , also @xmath145 for all @xmath115 . by definition of @xmath146",

    "in particular , these numbers all depend on @xmath109 and @xmath110 but not on @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
