    "are much more flexible than ordinary crystalline solids and , moreover , may remain in the linear elastic regime even in response to deformations increasing their dimensions far beyond their original , unstrained , size .",
    "such a behavior is attributed to the network structure of these materials , and to the fact that the elastic restoring forces are of entropic , rather than energetic , origin .",
    "the simplest theory of _ rubber elasticity _ which captures these essential physical features , is the `` phantom network '' ( pn ) model introduced by james and guth @xcite .",

    "in gels the network strands are very short and do not necessarily resemble gaussian springs .",
    "nevertheless , one may still construct a gaussian model of gel elasticity , simply by replacing each bond of the gel by a gaussian spring . in the absence of excluded volume interactions ,",
    "the validity of this model is justified by the fact that even if the elementary pair potential between bonded atoms is very different from that of a gaussian spring , the _ effective _ interaction between somewhat more distant atoms is , almost always , quadratic .",
    "this is a well known feature of long polymer chains  @xcite , but it has also been demonstrated for more complicated networks  @xcite .",
    "de gennes used an analogy between elasticity of networks of gaussian springs and conductivity of random resistor networks @xcite , and argued that rigidity , just like conductivity , appears at the connectivity threshold , when a macroscopically large network spans the system .",
    "he further argued that at the phase transition the shear modulus and the conductivity should have the same dependence on the distance of the system from the connectivity threshold .",

    "close to @xmath5 , their length scales like @xmath178 in two - dimensions the exponent @xmath179 , what implies that the length of the scbs diverges , and certainly does not satisfy criterion ( [ criterion ] ) .",
    "the problem is not limited to the scbs only , but is relevant to a larger fraction of the bonds including the doubly - connected bonds , triply - connected bonds , and so on .",
    "it is difficult to predict , a priori , whether this observation should modify the results of the nearly - gaussian model from section [ nearly ] .",
    "note that we do not encounter such a problem for dimensionality larger than two , where the exponent @xmath180 is positive .",
    "we have studied the elastic properties of phantom gaussian and nearly - gaussian networks . for gaussian networks ,",
    "the stress and elastic constants were calculated exactly .",
    "we found that a characteristic feature of gaussian networks is the vanishing of their elastic constants .",
    "this feature is both temperature and network - topology independent .",
    "we also proved the equality between the stress tensor of a gaussian elastic network to the conductivity tensor of a resistor network , in which the conductance of each resistor is equal to the corresponding spring constant @xmath35 .",
    "this result quantifies the somewhat vague statement about an analogy between elasticity of gaussian networks to conductivity of resistors networks .",
    "we have investigated the non - linear correction to the elastic behavior , by studying the properties of networks of springs whose energies include small quartic terms , additional to the leading quadratic ( gaussian ) terms . while the stress tensor is still dominated by the contribution of the quadratic term , the elastic constants ( which vanish in the gaussian network ) are solely due to the non - gaussian correction .",
    "we calculated the elastic constants to the first order in perturbation theory .",
    "finally , we applied the results of both the gaussian and the nearly - gaussian models , to describe the elastic behavior of phantom percolation networks close to the percolation threshold .",
    "obviously , the well known result that the shear modulus follows the same scaling law , @xmath181 , like the conductivity , was recovered .",
    "we made a new prediction that the elastic constants also follow a scaling law @xmath6 , with exponent @xmath182 , and found bounds on the values of the exponent @xmath7 .",
    "this work was supported by the israel science foundation through grant no",
    "we consider a network whose bonds are resistors of conductance @xmath35 , where the superscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 label the nodes which the particular resistor connects .",
    "the network is finite and has an arbitrary topology , i.e. , we make no assumption on the symmetry .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the position of the node @xmath33 and by @xmath183 the electric potential at the node .",
    "the network is placed inside a rectangular box of volume @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the length of the box along the @xmath42th cartesian direction .",
    "( the derivation presented here can be easily generalized to systems of arbitrary shape . )",
    "the nodes of the network which are located on the surface of the system are called surface nodes , and we label them with the superscript @xmath63 . the rest of the nodes are called the internal nodes , which we denote with the superscript @xmath32 . the superscripts @xmath33 and @xmath186 will be used to denote nodes of both types .",
    "the conductivity of an electrical system is a tensor , @xmath89 , defined by @xmath187 where the subscripts denote cartesian coordinates and summation over repeated indices is implied , while @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the volume averages of the current density and the electric field , respectively .",
    "this definition of @xmath89 applies to continuous electrical systems .",
    "it can be generalized to discrete networks , if we define the current density by a set of dirac @xmath188-functions representing the currents in the bonds .",
    "let us assume now that the electric potential , @xmath189 , applied on the surface of the network is such that on each surface point it is equal to the @xmath43th cartesian coordinate of the point .",
    "since @xmath190 , we have @xmath191,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the surface integration is over the boundaries @xmath192 and @xmath193 , normal to the @xmath42th direction .",
    "however , with our choice for the electric potential on the boundaries , @xmath194 , it is easy to see that @xmath195 , where @xmath15 is the krnecker delta .",
    "the mean current density @xmath196 , is given by @xmath197 as we have already noted , the above definition ( [ ji ] ) applies to continuous electrical systems . to make it applicable to resistor networks we need to write the current density as a sum of dirac @xmath188-functions representing the currents in the `` linear '' resistors . with this formal representation , the contribution to @xmath198 of each resistor",
    "is given by the line - integral @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the current across the resistor between nodes @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "adding the contributions of all the resistors we find that @xmath201 we may write the last result is a slightly different way @xmath202\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variable @xmath203 takes the value 1 if the nodes @xmath186 and @xmath33 are connected by a resistor and if at least one of them is an internal node ; and the value 0 , otherwise . the sums in square brackets corresponding to internal nodes @xmath204 vanish due to the kirchoff `` junction rule '' for the vanishing of the sum of currents entering an internal node : @xmath205 we are left with the contribution of the surface nodes @xmath206 only , i.e. , @xmath207 this last result can be also represented by summation over all the resistors @xmath208 , between surface and internal nodes @xmath209.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , since the electric field is equal to @xmath210 , we have from eq.([definition ] ) that @xmath211 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have obtained expression ( [ conductivity ] ) , which we constructed by mapping expression ( [ infstress3 ] ) for @xmath17 into the electrostatic problem .",
    "this proves that indeed @xmath156 .",
    "note that @xmath89 does not depend on the positions of the internal nodes but only on the details of the conductivity . in large random networks",
    "the relation ( [ definition ] ) suffices to define @xmath89 without need of a detailed specification of boundary conditions .",
    "however , out _ exact _ result is valid also for small networks of arbitrary topology , provided that the electric field @xmath212 is generated using the very specific boundary conditions specified in the appendix .",
