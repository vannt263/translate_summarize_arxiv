    "recently there have been intensive studies to test the deviations from the standard model ( sm ) at present and future colliders .",
    "the investigation of three gauge boson couplings plays an important role to manifest the non abelian gauge symmetry in standard electroweak theory .",
    "the precision measurement of the triple vector boson vertices will be the crucial test of the structure of the sm .",
    "analysis of @xmath4 vertex has been given by several papers for fermilab@xcite , lep2@xcite and ep@xcite collider desy hera .",
    "one of further projects is the linear collider ( lc ) design at desy @xcite which is the only one that can be converted into an ep @xcite collider .",
    "an aditional advantage of the linac - ring type ep colliders is the possibility of building @xmath0p colliders on their bases @xcite .",
    "the high energy gamma beam is obtained by the compton backscattering of laser photons off linac s electron beam .",
    "estimations show that this possibility appears quite realistic , since the spectrum of the scattered laser photons is hard and the luminosity for @xmath0p turns out to be of the same order as the one for ep collision . according to present project at desy",
    "500 gev electrons are allowed to collide 820 gev protons @xcite . in this case",
    "the corresponding parameters of the @xmath0p collider are shown in table [ tab1]@xcite .",
    "for photoproduction processes the cross sections in @xmath0p machines are about one order of magnitude larger than corresponding ep machines",
    ". therefore such kind of high energy @xmath0p colliders will be complementary tools to linac ring type ep colliders .    in this paper",
    "we examine the potential of future lc+hera based @xmath0p collider to probe anomalous ww@xmath0 coupling and compare the results from ep collider .",
    ".main parameters of lc+hera based @xmath0p collider . [ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown from table [ tab2 ] the cross sections using backscattered laser photons are considerably larger than the case of corresponding ep collision .",
    "we assume that the form factor structure of @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not depend on the momentum transfers at the energy region considered .",
    "then anomalous terms containing @xmath7 grow with @xmath8 and terms with @xmath6 rise with @xmath9 .",
    "deviation @xmath10 from sm value changes the total cross sections 30 - 70% whereas the @xmath11 gives 80% changes .",
    "therefore high energy will improve the sensitivity to anomalous couplings .",
    "for comparison with hera energy @xmath12 gev the similar results would be 20 - 40% for @xmath13 and 5% for @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to see how the anomalous couplings change the shape of the transverse momentum distributions of the final quark jet .",
    "for this reason we use the following formula :    @xmath15    where @xmath16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath17 with @xmath18 the @xmath1 spectrum b(@xmath19 of the quark jet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for various @xmath7 and @xmath6 values at lc+hera based @xmath0p collider .",
    "similar distribution is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for weizscker - williams approximation that covers the major contribution from ep collision .",
    "it is clear that the cross section at large @xmath1 is quite sensitive to anomalous @xmath4 couplings .",
    "as @xmath6 increases the cross section grows more rapidly when compared with @xmath7 dependence at high @xmath1 region @xmath20 gev .",
    "the cross sections with real gamma beam are one order of magnitude larger than the case of wwa .",
    "comparison between two figures also shows that the curves become more separable as @xmath21 gets large .",
    "we can estimate sensitivity of lc+hera based @xmath0p collider to anomalous couplings by assuming the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement to be 2% and systematic errors in the acceptance to be 2% for @xmath22 decay channel of the w and for the integrated luminosity values of @xmath23 pb@xmath24 .",
    "the acceptance in the muon channel is taken to be 65% .",
    "we use the following expression to add statistical and systematic errors to get the uncertainty on the cross section measurement @xmath25 where n is the number of @xmath26 and @xmath27 events given with their branching ratios in the @xmath22 channel and a is the acceptance of the related channel . above formula",
    "gives the following limits on the @xmath28 and @xmath6 for the deviation of the total cross section from the standard model value at 68% and 95% confidence levels :          in the compton backscattered photon case the sensitivity is limited by the systematic errors and comparable to the limits from projected future colliders@xcite .",
    "however this is limited by the statistics rather than systematic errors for wwa case .",
    "taking into account both the transverse momentum distribution of the quark jet and the sensitivity in the total cross section leads to very promising results for probing @xmath4 vertex at @xmath0p collider based on lc+hera .",
