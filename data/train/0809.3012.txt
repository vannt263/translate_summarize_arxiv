    "the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) is a new instrument at gemini - south telescope@xcite .",
    "nici had its first light in february 2007 and is currently undergoing on - sky tests before embarking on an ambitious 50-night planet - search campaign",
    ". the campaign will be executed in queue mode and should significantly improve the statistical constraints on the presence of giant planets around nearby main - sequence stars .",
    "the campaign builds on similar surveys by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nici combines a curvature ao system and a dual - channel imager .",
    "the two optical trains are designed to operate in a spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) mode . in this mode",
    "the field is imaged in two close wavelengths selected such that any cold companion would have widely different flux in the two channels while the stellar spectral energy distribution remains relatively flat .",
    "this allows for a calibration of the stellar speckle pattern using the _ off _ channel with minimal self - subtraction of the companion .",
    "all previous on - sky applications of this mode @xcite as well as the nominal nici mode use the deep methane absorption band around @xmath0 m , but the technique could conceivably be used on other spectroscopic features .",
    "sdi is limitations by the decorrelation of speckles between the channels due to non - common path aberrations , differences in the filter bandpasses , wavelength difference between filters , etc . once other noise contributions ( readout noise , uncorrected atmospheric speckles , photon noise ... )",
    "have averaged - out , no further gain in sensitivity can be obtained without resorting to other techniques as further integrations only provide higher signal - to - noise ration ( s / n ) on the fixed speckle pattern and does nt help detect a planet buried within it .",
    "the second technique envisioned for the nici campaign and general high - contrast imaging is roll subtraction , a.k.a .",
    "angular differential imaging ( adi ) @xcite .",
    "the technique is similar to the roll subtraction used on hst @xcite and takes advantage of the field rotation provided by an altitude - azimuth mount such as that of the gemini south telescope . in this mode",
    "the cassegrain focus or rotator is fixed , so the field rotates through the observation leaving all the optics ( telescope , ao system , dual - imager ) fixed . in this mode , field rotation provides a self - calibration of the psf . for every image , an estimate of the psf",
    "can be built using the rest of the dataset and subtracted from the frame of interest .",
    "once this is done for all frames , they can be rotated to a common position angle ( pa ) before combination . as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , any remaining speckle will add - up incoherently in the final image thus ensuring an ever increasing sensitivity . as the field also rotates during integrations",
    ", there is a greater amount of image elongation at larger radii , and this field position - dependent loss in sensitivity needs to be taken into account when designing a survey strategy ( see biller et al . in this volume ) . as a general rule , in the relatively short integrations used with nici ( typically a few seconds to a minute ) ,",
    "the angular smear is small , especially in the scientifically most relevant part of the field ( the inner @xmath1 ) .",
    "adi is most efficient in the outer parts of the psf where relatively fast field rotation allows one to use images taken within minutes of the frame of interest to built the reference psf . in the inner part of the field ( less than @xmath2 ) , the slower field rotation implies that only images taken tens of minutes from the frame of interest can be used to reconstruct the psf estimate .",
    "the ever - evolving instrumental speckle pattern therefore implies that the adi - reconstructed psf will be better correlated at large separation than closer in . in some particularly unfavorable cases ( i.e. objects low on the horizons or transiting directly overhead ) , adi subtraction at small separations can not be performed at all within a @xmath3 hours long observation .",
    "it is important to noted that adi and sdi are _ not _ competing techniques and that they may very well be used on the same dataset .",
    "the third important feature of nici is the presence of a semi - transparent focal plane mask .",
    "a wheel allows the positioning of a set of masks ranging in diameter from @xmath4 to @xmath5 as well a clear glass element of the same optical thickness .",
    "the central part of masks have a typical transmission of 1 part in 300 ( see ftaclas et al . in this volume ) .",
    "while the strehl ratio obtained by nici ( @xmath6 in @xmath7 , @xmath8 in @xmath9 ) are not sufficient to perform diffraction coronagraphy , the focal plane masks still help improve sensitivity by 1 ) limiting the amount of light entering the system and thus minimizing ghosts , 2 ) avoiding the deep saturation of the central parts of the psf that would create electronic ghosts and leakage and 3 ) providing a non - saturated diffraction core as both an astrometric and photometric reference for registering images .",
    "this paper describes the broad data reduction of a preliminary nici dataset obtained during commissioning and provides sensitivity measurements for important steps to quantify the relative gains .",
    "observations are described in   [ observations ] ,",
    "  [ reduction ] describes the various data reduction steps and   [ discussion ] details their relative sensitivity gains .",
    "figure  [ beforeafter ] shows an example of a raw nici frame and the final image obtained with the data reduction method described here .",
    "an important measure of the performance of nici is the sensitivity gain through sdi . implementing the dual channel imager has a financial , technical and sensitivity cost , part of the optical train has to be duplicated , in the design adopted here",
    "two detectors were used , @xmath10 of the light is lost at the beam splitter compared to a simple imager , splitting the light in two channels implies that the effective readout noise contribution is doubled relative to the signal , etc .",
    "of course , this price is paid to obtained as to obtain better calibration of the speckle pattern and , at least for the most scientifically relevant part of the field , is providing a gain in sensitivity .",
    "the difference between the _",
    "short_-channel loci and the dual - channel loci provides an estimate of the sensitivity gain in having two channels ( see lower panel of figure  [ contrast ] ) . the final _",
    "short_-channel loci is the deepest image one could achieve using a single channel image . in a survey using two epochs to identify faint companions ( such as the gdps by ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this would define the sensitivity for a given epoch .",
    "one could argue that a single - channel imager would go @xmath11  mag deeper within the same period of time thanks to the @xmath10 gain in throughput .",
    "this is certainly the case in the read - out noise limited part of the image beyond @xmath12 , but the signal - to - noise in the inner part of the psf is _ not _ limited by flux level , but by residual speckle noise that the loci algorithm failed to subtract .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ contrast ] , the noise in the central part of the _ short_-channel loci image is dominated by fwhm - sized structures , not pixel - to - pixel fluctuations .",
    "gains in sensitivity for this region of the psf can only be obtained by observing a larger number of individual realizations of the speckle pattern , _ not _ by increasing the per - image flux . at the edge of the occulting mask ,",
    "there is a @xmath13  mag sensitivity gain in including the second channel images , and this gain drops to about @xmath14  mag at a @xmath15 radii .",
    "this rapid drop is easily explained by the fact that the efficiency of angular differential imaging increases with radii .",
    "the authors would like to thank the gemini engineering group for their hard work and dedication to the nici project ; javier luhrs , ramon galvez and cristian urrutia on software ; gaston gausachs on nici thermal enclosure .",
