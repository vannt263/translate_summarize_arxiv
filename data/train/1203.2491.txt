    "several recent circuit qed experiments based on josephson junctions in superconducting circuits were concerned with the properties of driven nonlinear resonators  @xcite .",
    "josephson junctions allow engineering strong nonlinearities , which can lead to pronounced quantum effects , such as non - classical photon number distributions @xcite . at the same time , without leaving the quantum regime , the damping of the resonator can be made sufficiently strong to measure the radiation emitted by the resonator .",
    "state - of - the - art measurements give access to the spectral density of the emitted radiation @xmath0 .",
    "this yields detailed information about the quantum and classical fluctuations of the resonator @xcite .",
    "some of the experiments with coherently driven resonators based on a josephson junction were concerned with the development of a josephson bifurcation amplifier to be used as a high - contrast readout device for superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "the josephson bifurcation amplifier makes use of the dynamical bistability induced by a linear periodic driving with frequency @xmath1 close to the oscillator eigenfrequency @xmath2 . in the readout process",
    ", the two qubit states are mapped onto the two stable vibrational states of the resonator , which can be easily distinguished , since they differ strongly in amplitude and phase .",
    "the measurment backaction depends on the oscillator power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the stable vibrational states are described by nearly sinusoidal oscillations with frequency @xmath1 .",
    "they are separated by a dynamical barrier in phase space @xcite . the amplitude and phase of the forced oscillations display quantum and thermal fluctuations . for typical parameters , the timescales for these fluctuations",
    "are set by the detuning @xmath3 between the coherent driving and the resonator and by the relaxation rate @xmath4 .",
    "here we consider the regime , where the fluctuations are small on average and the oscillator stays in the vicinity of one of the stable solutions for times much longer than the fluctuations characteristic timescales , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "many theoretical investigations have focused on rare large fluctuations which allow overcoming the dynamical barrier and induce the switching between the stable solutions @xcite or on tunneling @xcite .",
    "the deep quantum regime , where the average number of excitations in the resonator is small and quantum fluctuations are large has also attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum in this regime has been investigated in @xcite .    although the emission spectrum @xmath0 in principle carries information about rare large fluctuations @xcite , most of the radiation is emitted as a consequence of small fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the standard approach for computing the spectrum @xmath0 is to linearize the motion around the stable solutions @xcite .",
    "the small fluctuations display damped harmonic oscillations with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the decay of the fluctuation correlations is accompanied by the emission of radiation with frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , since the slow oscillations are superimposed to the fast oscillations with the driving frequency .",
    "the resulting emission spectrum is reminiscent of the raman spectrum of a diatomic molecule : beside the main rayleigh peak at frequency @xmath1 , which describes radiation emitted coherently , it has two raman - type side - peaks with raman shift @xmath10 . in a quantum mechanical picture , the quasi - energy level spacing , i.e.",
    ", the distance between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in a frame rotating with the driving frequency , is approximatively given by @xmath11 , and the raman lines are induced by transition between nearest - neighbor quasi - energy eigenstates . in this context ,",
    "the same driving field defines and probes the quasi - energy spectrum .    in this paper , we are interested in a regime where typical fluctuations are intermediate in size : they are too weak to induce switching between the two solutions , so that the resonator stays locked to one of the stable solutions for a long time , but they are strong enough to lead to nonlinear dynamics , so that one has to go beyond the simple raman picture for the emission spectrum .",
    "it has been shown that quantum fluctuations of intermediate size may give rise to a fine structure in the spectrum @xcite .    in this work we point to two additional features of the emission spectrum , which are consequences of the nonlinear nature of the quasi - energy hamiltonian and",
    "should be observable in experiments @xcite : i ) intermediate strength nonlinear fluctuations are not simply damped sinusoidal oscillations but have higher harmonics yielding additional peaks in the resonator emission spectrum at frequencies @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "these higher order peaks resembles the peaks in the power spectrum of a static oscillator with a small cubic anharmonicity close to integer multiples of its eigenfrequency @xcite . at the quantum level ,",
    "the higher harmonics derive from transitions between quasi - energy levels which are not nearest neighbors .",
    "ii ) moreover , fluctuations in an asymmetric quasi - energy potential yield an additional broad peak at the frequency @xmath1 . unlike the fine structure of the emission spectrum ,",
    "the effects we consider here are not restricted to the quantum regime but extend to the classical regime where thermal fluctuations are dominant .",

    "when the oscillator relaxation rate is much smaller than its eigenfrequency , @xmath34 , and the bath spectral density close to @xmath2 is smooth , the dissipative dynamics of the system can be described by a simple master equation in the lindblad form @xmath35 +    \\gamma(1+\\bar{n}){\\cal d}[a]{\\rho } +   \\gamma \\bar{n}{\\cal   d}[a^{\\dagger}]{\\rho } ,   \\label{eq : liouville}\\ ] ] where the lindblad superoperator is defined through @xmath36{\\rho}\\equiv 2o{\\rho}o^{\\dagger } -o^{\\dagger}o{\\rho}-{\\rho}oo^{\\dagger}$ ] , and @xmath37 is the oscillator distribution in the absence of driving .    for long times",

    "such peaks are consistent with weakly damped oscillations of the fluctuation of @xmath26 with period @xmath60 , which are mostly harmonic but have substantial second harmonic and average over a period @xmath61 . a linearized theory of the fluctuations around the mean - field solutions @xcite yields damped harmonic oscillations for the fluctuations of @xmath26 , but does not capture the second order peaks for @xmath62 .",

    "<S> motivated by recent `` circuit qed '' experiments we investigate the noise properties of coherently driven nonlinear resonators . by using josephson junctions in superconducting circuits , </S>",
    "<S> strong nonlinearities can be engineered , which lead to the appearance of pronounced effects already for a low number of photons in the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> based on a master equation approach we determine the emission spectrum and observe for typical circuit qed parameters , in addition to the primary raman - type peaks , second - order peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks describe higher harmonics in the slow noise - induced fluctuations of the oscillation amplitude of the resonator and provide a clear signature of the nonlinear nature of the system . </S>"
