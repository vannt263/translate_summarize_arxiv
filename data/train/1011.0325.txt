    "galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed structures known to exist in the universe .",
    "the masses of rich clusters can reach @xmath8 and the more distant ones , from around @xmath9 , subtend several arcminutes on the sky due to the slow variation of the angular diameter distance with redshift . as a result , clusters are powerful tracers of structure formation and evolution on scales of the order of a few megaparsecs . according to the standard @xmath10 cold dark matter ( @xmath11 ) model , galaxy clusters form via hierarchical interactions of smaller subsystems . during merger ,",
    "these subclusters collide at relative velocities of thousands of km@xmath12 and can release gravitational binding energies of up to @xmath13 , which can lead to shocks in the intracluster medium ( i m ) .",
    "these conditions make cluster mergers ideal places to study the dynamics of matter under extreme conditions . the three assumed main components comprising the cluster , namely galaxies , hot ionized gas and dark matter , exhibit very different behaviours during subcluster mergers .",
    "the hot intergalactic gas is heated and compressed by the hydrodynamical shocks produced during the passage of the subcluster through the core of the primary , whereas the dark matter and galaxies are collisionless ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the gas is slowed down by ram pressure and is displaced from the dark matter and the galaxies .",
    "later , when the subcluster reaches regions of lower gas density in the primary cluster , the ram pressure drops sharply .",
    "without as much ram pressure , the gas pressure and subcluster gravity cause some of the subcluster gas , which had been lagging behind the subcluster s dark matter centre , to ` slingshot ' past it .",
    "this gas is then left unbound from the subcluster and free to expand adiabatically @xcite .",
    "abell 2146 is a cluster at @xmath14 consisting of two merging subclusters .",
    "the smaller subcluster passed through the centre of the larger subcluster some @xmath15 gyrs ago producing shock fronts which have been detected by chandra @xcite .",
    "these shock fronts are unusual features which only show at a specific stage in the cluster merger , before the shock reaches the outer , low - surface - brightness regions , and at angles on the sky plane which usually prevents the projection from hiding the density edge .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that shock fronts with mach numbers significantly greater than one have only been detected in two other clusters : 1e0657 - 56 @xcite the `` bullet cluster'' and a520 @xcite . unlike a520 , the bullet cluster and abell 2146 appear to be at an early stage of the merger event , where the cluster dynamics are simpler and the separation of the hot gas and the dark matter components is clearer .",
    "the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect provides an independent way of exploring the physics of the intracluster gas and examining typical cluster parameters such as core radius and gas mass .",
    "when cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons traverse a rich galaxy cluster some will be inverse - compton scattered by the random thermal motion of the electrons in the intracluster gas @xcite . unlike x - ray surface brightness , sz surface brightness is independent of redshift and is therefore well suited for the study of galaxy clusters at any redshift .",
    "it is also less sensitive than x - ray measurements to small - scale clumping and the complex dynamics associated with the cluster core .    in this paper",
    "we present @xmath16-ghz sz effect images of abell 2146 using ami . in section [ telescope ]",
    "we discuss the telescope , while details of the observations and the reduction pipeline are given in section [ obsprep ] . in section [ bay ] bayesian inference is introduced .",
    "section [ physical - model - and ] describes our analysis methodology while in section [ res ] and section [ dis ] we present the results and discuss their significance .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ conc ] .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "relevant parameters are given in terms of the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath26 kms@xmath27mpc@xmath27 , except where otherwise stated .",
    "we also refer to @xmath28 kms@xmath27mpc@xmath27 .",
    "all coordinates are at epoch j2000 .",
    "ami comprises two arrays : the small array ( sa ) which consists of ten @xmath29-m diameter antennas , and the large array ( la ) with eight @xmath30-m antennas , located at lord s bridge , cambridge @xcite .",
    "the higher resolution and flux sensitivity of the la allows contaminating radio sources to be dealt with .",
    "these sources can then be subtracted from the sa maps .",
    "a summary of the technical details of ami is given in table [ tab : tech ] .",
    "further details on the telescope can be found in @xcite .",
    ".ami technical summary [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the total mass can also be estimated from the x - ray @xmath31 relation ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) ( note that here we use a different scaling relation than elsewhere since we are concerned with cluster parameters at @xmath32 ) . excluding the cool core region , the x - ray spectroscopic temperature is @xmath33 kev , which corresponds to a mass @xmath34 ( using @xmath35 ) .",
    "this method will likely overestimate the cluster mass as we expect the temperature to have been temporarily boosted during this major merger by a factor of a few ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a mass estimate for the bullet cluster from the @xmath31 relation produced a result approximately a factor of 2.4 higher than the weak lensing result for the same region ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume the x - ray mass estimate for abell 2146 is overestimated by a similar factor , the cluster mass should be closer to @xmath36 , which is comparable with our sz effect result .",
    "however , simulations show that the transient increase in the x - ray temperature is dependent on the time since the collision , the impact parameter of the merger and the mass ratio of the merging clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , which will be different for the bullet cluster . a weak lensing analysis using new subaru suprime - cam observations will produce a more accurate measure of the mass for comparison with the sz effect result .",
    "the vla radio image taken at @xmath37-ghz ( nrao / vla archive survey ) and the contours representing the la map are superimposed on the x - ray image in fig . [",
    "fig : vla-4.9-ghz ] .",
    "the presence of a bright source on top of the dense cluster core obscures any possible high - resolution sz features in the la map .",
    "high - resolution sz images using the la would be possible if higher resolution data taken at 16-ghz were available for source subtraction .",
    "the longer baselines of the la proved insufficient to remove the contaminant sources and no sz effect decrement was seen on the source subtracted la maps .",
    "high - resolution sz effect measurements are necessary to disentangle the density and temperature distributions properly .",
    "these observations in other cluster mergers like the bullet cluster @xcite have revealed structure in the gas pressure distribution and are powerful tools for understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "radio halos are faint , large - scale sources that often span the entire cluster and are typically found in cluster mergers .",
    "two hours of vla observations in two configurations , c and d , towards a520 revealed a radio halo with a power of @xmath38w hz@xmath27 @xcite at 1.4-ghz . the bullet cluster was also found to have a radio halo with a power of @xmath39 w hz@xmath27 at @xmath40-ghz @xcite .",
    "no low frequency radio data are currently available for abell 2146 .",
    "4.9-ghz vla observations of abell 2146 do not show signs for a radio halo , fig .",
    "[ fig : vla-4.9-ghz ] , though deeper observations , particularly at lower frequencies where radio halo emission tends to be stronger , would be needed to determine whether a radio halo is present in abell 2146 .",
    "since such halos are characterized by a steeply falling spectrum ( e.g @xcite ) and no radio halo emission was detected at 4.9-ghz , we do not expect our observations to be contaminated by this diffuse emission .",
    "a520 and 1e0657 - 56 are the only two clusters that have been found to have both bow shocks and radio halos . they have provided unique information that allows determination of what proportion of the ultrarelativistic electrons producing the radio halo are generated as a result of merger - driven turbulence , as opposed to shock acceleration @xcite . since abell 2146",
    "is the third cluster merger known to contain substantially supersonic shock fronts , finding a radio halo would significantly improve our current understanding of how they are generated and powered .",
    "the cluster parameters obtained from m3 , our preferred model , are discussed below .      the mean value for the position , @xmath41 @xmath42 , with errors of @xmath43 and @xmath44 arcseconds respectively , coincides with the x - ray centroid position , @xmath41 @xmath45 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xraysz ] .",
    "however , the peak of the x - ray flux is significantly displaced from the peak of the sz signal , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xraysz ] .",
    "the x - ray spectral luminosity is proportional to @xmath46 , while the sz effect is a measure of the integrated line - of - sight pressure and is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray emission is more sensitive to substructure than the sz data and peaks at the position of the dense cluster core .",
    "results from running on large samples of clusters have forced the prior on @xmath4 to be relaxed to include higher values ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions for @xmath4 tend to favour higher values than typical x - ray estimates . however , this discrepancy is not surprising since previous studies have revealed incompatibilities in the @xmath4 fits between x - ray and sz effect profiles due to their different dependencies on parameters such as temperature and density @xcite .",
    "the results show the degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath4 but also show evidence of strong constraints on this relation .",
    "this relation is positively correlated in m1 and m2 , where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is made to estimate parameters at @xmath5 , and negatively correlated in m3 where this assumption is avoided .",
    "sampling from @xmath49 allows further prior information to be introduced into the model which leads to better constrained parameter estimates .",
    "all the models were run through without data to check the effect of the priors on the results . from this test we discovered that in m1 the seemingly inconspicuous priors on the sampling parameters lead to an effective prior on @xmath50 that peaks around @xmath51 and strongly disfavours values of @xmath52 . since in our current models sz data alone can not place strong constraints on @xmath50 , the effective prior biases low the estimates of @xmath50 obtained in m1 . on the other hand , when running m3 without data , the effective prior on @xmath50 does not change significantly from the gaussian prior it was initially given .",
    "given the importance of analysing cluster models without any data to interpret their results , a detailed discussion of these no - data runs and the effects of cluster parameterization are presented in the forthcoming paper , @xcite .",
    "the average cluster gas temperature within @xmath53 kpc for @xmath35 was found to be @xmath54 kev . the projected emission - weighted temperature map , fig .",
    "[ fig : projtemp ] , shows a range of x - ray temperature measurements in different regions of the cluster . at the position of the most negative value of the sz decrement , the x - ray temperature is @xmath55 kev whereas at a radius of @xmath56kpc the temperature drops below 5 kev . in @xcite , a single - temperature fit to the cluster spectrum of abell 2146 using an absorbed thermal plasma emission model yields a temperature of @xmath57kev .",
    "the higher x - ray temperature measurement is not surprising since m3 s derived temperature estimate refers to the mean cluster gas temperature within @xmath5 and therefore averages over scales where the temperature is lower .",
    "moreover , emission - weighted temperatures will be higher than mass weighted temperature estimates .",
    "analytical and numerical simulations have already established the integrated sz signal as a robust tool for determining the total cluster mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the measured sz signal is sensitive to large scales away from the cluster core and is therefore able to provide an estimate for the @xmath58 which is independent of the small - scale mechanisms that regulate the state of the cluster gas near the core .",
    "we find that , subject to the assumptions of m3 described in section [ model3 ] , at the virial radius , @xmath5 , @xmath59 ; note that this estimate is free from the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the ami @xmath16-ghz observations of abell 2146 presented in this paper show the sunyaev - zeldovich effect produced by this cluster with a peak signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath60 .",
    "we detect 15 4-@xmath61 sources within 0.1 of the primary beam in the sa pointed map using the high resolution la observations .",
    "these sources were subtracted from the sa maps at the la position using the flux densities obtained from running our bayesian analysis software , , on the cluster model m3 . despite the substantial radio emission from the direction of abell 2146 , no significant contamination from radio sources is visible on the maps .",
    "we compare our sz observations with x - ray data taken by chandra and find an offset between the peaks of the two signals .",
    "we show that the sa data resolves our sz decrement and note that the directions of the most pronounced elongations in the sz and x - ray signals seem to be at @xmath62 to each other .",
    "these results show complex dynamics indicative of a cluster merger and the differences in the gas emission and pressure distributions .",
    "we run , on three different cluster models , all of which assume an isothermal , spherical @xmath4-model , and extract posterior probability distributions of large - scale cluster parameters of abell 2146 in the presence of radio point sources , primordial cmb and receiver noise . in m1 , a model representative of more traditional cluster parameterizations , the seemingly inconspicuous priors on the sampling parameters lead to an effective prior on the derived parameter @xmath63 which biases low this parameter and leads to further biases in other model parameters .",
    "m2 and m3 exploit the observation that the gas fractions do not appear to vary greatly between clusters and sample directly from @xmath49introducing further constraints in our parameter space and avoiding the bias problem in m1 .",
    "the difference between m2 and m3 lies in the derivation of the global cluster gas temperature , @xmath64 .",
    "m2 assumes the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium while in m3 @xmath64 can be deduced from the virial theorem ( assuming all of the kinetic energy is in the form of internal gas energy ) .",
    "given the relative masses of the two merging systems in abell 2146 and , provided the primary cluster was virialized before the merger , we find that the @xmath64 derived from the m - t relation in m3 will change by @xmath65 k during the merger .",
    "the results from m2 and m3 are consistent , despite differences in the mean values of the large - scale cluster parameters .",
    "however , we choose to focus on the results obtained in m3 since this model overcomes some of the shortcomings of more traditional models and its global temperature estimate is not significantly affected by the merger event .",
    "we find that at @xmath5 @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath7 kev and core radius @xmath68 .",
    "we also find that the probability of sz + cmb primordial structure + radio sources + receiver noise to cmb + radio sources + receiver noise is @xmath3 .",
