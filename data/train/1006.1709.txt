    "the study on superconductors without inversion symmetry has attracted growing interest in the past years.@xcite the penetration depth and nmr measurements@xcite in two noncentrosymmetric superconductors , li@xmath5pt@xmath6b and li@xmath5pd@xmath6b , with similar structure have shown that the absence of inversion symmetry along with stronger spin - orbit coupling may allow an admixture of spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairings .",
    "mg@xmath7ir@xmath1b@xmath2 ( hereafter abbreviated as mgirb ) is another typical material without inversion symmetry.@xcite the specific heat and nmr measurements have shown that the cooper pairs in mgirb are predominantly in the spin - singlet state with an isotropic s - wave gap.@xcite meanwhile , the unconventional pairing state is also suggested by the tunneling spectroscopy and penetration depth measurements in this system.@xcite the electronic structure of mgirb has been calculated using the korringa - kohn - rostoker method showing a rather complex band structure near the fermi surface.@xcite therefore , one may expect a notable multi - band effect in this system .",
    "however , no report about this issue can be seen from the experimental side .",
    "so an in - depth study using the hall effect and magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements is required .",
    "we have known that , in conventional metals , the hall coefficient @xmath3 is almost independent of temperature in a rather wide temperature region . however , a clear temperature dependence of @xmath3 have been found in the underdoped cuprate superconductors and multi - band superconductor mgb@xmath5.@xcite the nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath4 and rather large mr are also observed in mgb@xmath5 thin films,@xcite which are attributed to the strong multi - band effect .",
    "recently , the multi - band behaviors are also revealed in the newly discovered iron - based superconductors by the hall effect measurements.@xcite    in this paper , we report a detailed investigation on the transport properties on high - quality noncentrosymmetric mgirb samples with different critical transition temperatures . we found a strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath3 and nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath4 in wide temperature region , which were attributed to the multi - band effect in the system .",
    "moreover , a large magnetoresistance ( @xmath8 ) and the violation of the kohler s rule were observed in all the samples , further confirming the argument about multi - band effect .",
    "the mgirb polycrystalline samples used in this study were prepared using a standard method of solid state reaction .",
    "the synthesizing process is the same as our previous work@xcite except that a relatively long time up to 10 hours was used in the second sintering process .",
    "the samples were cut into a bar shape with typical dimensions of 3.2 @xmath9 1.8 @xmath9 0.3 mm@xmath10 .",
    "a six - probe technique was employed to carry out the measurements , which ensures us to measure the longitudinal and hall resistivity simultaneously at each temperature .",
    "the magnetic field up to 9 t was applied perpendicular to the sample surface .    the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements of our samples",
    "were carried out by a @xmath11 mxp18a - hf diffractometer with the cu-@xmath12 radiation .",
    "the ac susceptibility was measured based on an oxford cryogenic system ( maglab - exa-12 ) .",
    "the longitudinal resistivity ( @xmath13 ) and the hall resistivity ( @xmath4 ) were measured on the quantum design instrument physical property measurement system ( ppms ) with temperature down to 1.8 k. we used a dc technique for electrical resistivity measurements and the current was reversed to correct any thermopower resulting from the electrical contact .",
    "the temperature stabilization was better than 0.1% and the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10 nv .",
    "temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility of three samples with different @xmath14 are shown in fig .",
    "the onset points of the superconducting transitions in the susceptibility curves are 2.5 k , 4.7 k , and 5.7 k , respectively , for the three samples .",
    "the differences in @xmath14 have been reported to originate from the small variety of the amounts of mg and b in the formula.@xcite hereafter we denote the three samples as mgirb2.5k , mgirb4.7k , and mgirb5.7k , respectively . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , we show the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath13 near the superconducting transition under zero field .",
    "one can see that the transition width determined from resistive measurements ( @xmath15 ) is only about 0.2 k , which is consistent with the rather sharp magnetic transition as revealed by the ac susceptibility data .",
    "the residual resistivity of about 100 @xmath16 cm here is much smaller than the value reported in the previous work@xcite , which suggests that the samples used in this study is much cleaner with fewer scattering centers .",
    "the resistivity data for two samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb5.7k are shown in the inset in a rather wide temperature range .",
    "the xrd patterns for the two samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb5.7k are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that all the main peaks can be indexed to the bcc crystal structure .",
    "only tiny peaks from impurities were found , as represented by the blue asterisks .     measured with @xmath17=0.1 oe ,",

    "the curves were normalized by the value obtained at 2 k. ( b ) temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity for the same samples near the superconducting transition under zero field .",
    "inset shows the resistivity data for two samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb5.7k in a wide temperature range up to 300 k. ]",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3 shows the field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath4 at different temperatures for the sample mgirb2.5k . in the experiment @xmath4",
    "was taken as @xmath19/2 $ ] at each point to eliminate the effect of the misaligned hall electrodes . clear nonlinear field dependence of @xmath4 can be seen in the low temperature region , which is actually consistent with the multi - band scenario as revealed in mgb@xmath5 and iron - based superconductors.@xcite as the temperature increases , the behavior of the curves evolves into linearity gradually , indicating the weakening of the multi - band effect at high temperatures .",
    "temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ( @xmath20 ) for three samples are shown in the main frame of fig .",
    "3 . one can see rather strong temperature dependence of @xmath3 in low temperature region .",
    "this behavior gives another evidence of the presence of multi - band effect in our samples .",
    "here we employ a simple two - band model to interpret our data qualitatively .",
    "we have known that for a two - band system in the low - field limit , the hall coefficient @xmath3 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( i = 1 , 2 ) is the conductance of the charge carriers in different bands , and @xmath23 represents the hall coefficient for the carriers in each band separately with @xmath24 the concentration of the charge carriers in the different bands . from equation ( 1 ) , we know that the contributions of @xmath3 from different bands are mainly determined by @xmath22 , which can be influenced by the scattering relaxation time @xmath25 .",
    "the charge carrier in different bands may have different @xmath25 , which varies differently with temperature . in this case , each band can produce complex contributions to the @xmath3 .",
    "we note that this effect is more remarkable in the samples with lower @xmath14 and the sign - reversing effect of @xmath3 can be even seen in the samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb4.7k .",
    "this sign - reversing behavior actually indicates the presence of different types of charge carriers ( electron and hole type ) in the present system .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath3 becomes weak at high temperatures , being consistent with the linear behavior in the @xmath26 curves at high temperatures as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 .     for three samples",
    "mgirb2.5k , mgirb4.7k , and mgirb5.7k .",
    "a strong temperature dependence can be seen below 160 k. inset : magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath4 at different temperatures for mgirb2.5k . ]    to further confirm our conclusions , we study the magnetoresistance in the same system . here",
    "we present the results of one typical sample mgirb2.5k . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we show the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity @xmath13 under different fields .",
    "clear mr effect can be observed even in this raw data .",
    "here mr is defined as @xmath27/\\rho_0 $ ] , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the longitudinal resistivity at a magnetic field h and that at zero field , respectively .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath30 for two samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb5.7k obtained under 9 t is shown in fig .",
    "the value of mr for the two samples are determined to be 25% and 20% , respectively , at about 6 k. it has been pointed out that in a single - band system , the lorentz force is balanced by the hall field . as a result , the charge carriers can move as if in zero field and they will never be deflected . in that case",
    ", there will be no obvious magnetoresistance observed .",
    "so the large value of mr observed here is quite consistent with the multi - band scenario stated above .",
    "for the sample mgirb2.5k under different magnetic fields .",
    "( b ) temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance @xmath30 obtained under 9 t for the samples mgirb2.5k and mgirb5.7k .",
    "( c ) the kohler plot at different temperatures ( see text ) for the sample mgirb2.5k .",
    "( d ) magnetic field dependence of @xmath30 at several selected temperatures for the sample mgirb2.5k .",
    "the solid lines represent the theoretical fit to the data using a two - band model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    another evidence of the multiband effect is the violation of the kohler s rule .",
    "the semiclassical transport theory has predicted that the kohler s rule will hold if only one isotropic relaxation time is present in a single - band system.@xcite the kohler s rule can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an implicit function which is independent of temperature .",
    "equation ( 2 ) means that the @xmath30 vs @xmath33 curves ( the so - called kohler plot ) for different temperatures should be scaled to a universal curve if the kohler s rule is obeyed .",
    "figure 4(c ) shows the kohler plot from the mr data for the sample mgirb2.5k .",
    "an obvious violation of the kohler s rule can be seen from this plot .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the multi - band effect in this system , just as the case in mgb@xmath5 , where the different temperature dependence of the relaxation times in different bands was considered to be the main reason of the violation of the kohler s",
    "rule.@xcite    to get a comprehensive understanding , we have attempted to fit the field dependent mr data using a simple two - band model : @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 the fitting parameters which were related to the conductances and mobilities for the charge carriers in two bands . shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) is the magnetic field dependence of @xmath30 at several selected temperatures for the sample mgirb2.5k .",
    "one can see the nonlinear behavior in each curve .",
    "the fitting results using equation ( 3 ) are represented by the solid lines .",
    "clear departure from the experimental data can be observed in the low temperature region .",
    "when the temperature is higher than 60 k , the theoretical curves based on the two - band model can roughly describe the data .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that , at least in low temperatures , there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of our samples .",
    "in other words , the conduction of our samples is dominated by more than two bands at low temperatures , then it behaves like the two - band scenario in the intermediate temperature region , and finally it evolves to the single - band behavior at temperatures above 160 k when the interband scattering becomes very strong .",
    "in summary , hall effect and magnetoresistance were measured on the noncentrosymmetric superconductors mg@xmath0ir@xmath1b@xmath2 with different @xmath14 . we found a strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath3 and nonlinear field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath4 in wide temperature region in all the samples investigated here . moreover , a rather large magnetoresistance up to 20% under 9 t and the violation of the kohler s rule were observed in our samples .",
    "these experimental features are all consistent with the conclusion that the samples we studied belong to the multi - band system .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that there may be more than two bands contributing to the conduction of the samples in the low temperature region .",
    "it is this multi - band effect that weakens the expected admixture of the spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairings .",
