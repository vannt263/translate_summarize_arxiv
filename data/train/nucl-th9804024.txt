    "in this talk we shall discuss the quality of our knowledge of the parameters which describe @xmath0 low  energy interactions . the forthcoming beginning of operations at da@xmath3ne provides an interesting possibility for improving this knowledge@xcite , but a motivation for further study has also emerged from our analysis of the @xmath1 channels parameters presented at the recent menu 97 symposium in vancouver@xcite .",
    "it is customary to analyse the low  energy @xmath0 interactions using a multichannel k ",
    "matrix ( or , equivalently , m  matrix , with @xmath4 ) formalism@xcite @xmath5 in this equation @xmath6 is a real hermitian matrix , possibly depending on energy , and @xmath7 is the diagonal matrix of the c.m .",
    "momenta @xmath8 for the different @xmath9 channels .",
    "@xmath10 indicates the isospin and @xmath11 the orbital angular momentum of the partial wave considered . neglecting the @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels , as done at these low energies for limited statistics experiments , each partial wave of the @xmath0 interactions",
    "is described by a matrix of dimensions @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "note that in this isospin decomposition the @xmath18 channels are considered together with the @xmath19 ones : this neglects mass difference effects which will be important at da@xmath3ne , since the charge ",
    "exchange threshold in @xmath20 scattering is at a lab .",
    "momentum @xmath21 90 mev / c .",
    "this formalism has been used to analyse data from experiments carried out between threshold and a lab .",
    "momentum @xmath22 500 mev / c , and for this purpose s , p and d waves have been considered@xcite .",
    "the matrix elements required for an analysis including up to @xmath23 are 36 , and if one takes into account their energy dependence , this increases further the number of parameters : for instance , in ref .",
    "[ 4a ] they are 44 .    this problem has been circumvented either by analysing the data using only s waves ( with only 9 matrix elements)@xcite , and reducing consequently the highest laboratory momentum considered , or by introducing some theoretical constraints on the parameters@xcite .    as we shall show , the parametrization of ref .",
    "[ 4a ] , which includes all waves up to @xmath23 , badly violates obvious consistency conditions coming from dispersion relations .",
    "this strongly suggests the need for new analyses which could take advantage of the much better data da@xmath3ne is expected to make available , and which could incorporate adequate dispersion relation constraints .",
    "we recall that the @xmath24 interaction at low energy , whose analyses make a heavy use of such constraints , is very well known , even if some uncertainty , of the order of a few percent , still exists on the @xmath25 coupling constant@xcite .",
    "our hope is that in a few years the joint work of experimentalists and theorists might lead , if not to a comparable quality in the knowledge of the @xmath0 interaction , at least to the elimination of the difficulties we are going to present here .",
    "the reasons for putting so much hope in da@xmath3ne are well known@xcite : this machine will produce kaon pairs in quantities such as to lead to statistics orders of magnitude better than those of the experiments analysed in the past , and with an excellent momentum resolution .    even if the main scientific goals of da@xmath3ne are direct cp violation in @xmath26 decays , rare decays and bounds on cpt violation , the machine offers unique possibilities for measurements of angular distributions and polarization of final  state hyperons in @xmath0 interactions , provided a strong scientific case for such experiments exists .",
    "the analysis of ref . [ 4a ] , of about thirty years ago , is the only one which includes up to d waves and extends down to the @xmath0 threshold , with a reasonable behaviour in the unphysical region below that threshold .",
    "we shall discuss here the inconsistencies put in evidence for that analysis by dispersion relations .",
    "we do not perform a similar analysis of parametrizations which only use s waves , because ( i ) it is obvious that their region of validity is significantly smaller , ( ii ) our method is particularly sensitive to p waves ( and we anticipate that they will appear to be very poorly known ) , and ( iii ) one expects that the decuplet resonance @xmath27 must play a significant role , as its non  strange partner @xmath28 does in the @xmath24 case .",
    "our consistency test is based on the evaluation of the @xmath29 couplings .",
    "we recall that flavour su(3 ) symmetry provides definite predictions for these quantities@xcite in terms of one of them , @xmath30 , and of a parameter @xmath31 which expresses the weight of the antisymmetric octet in the direct product @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath29 coupling constants are usually evaluated by forward dispersion relations , and in the case of the @xmath9 sector a slightly different situation occurs for @xmath33 couplings with respect to the @xmath34 ones . in the case of @xmath34 couplings , since @xmath35 total cross sections are known up to very high energies , one can write once  subtracted dispersion relations for the spin  averaged forward amplitude @xmath36 , since its imaginary part is directly proportional to @xmath37 via the optical theorem .",
    "this amplitude turns out to be s  wave dominated at very low energies , and this has made it possible to determine these couplings from low  energy analyses which only included the s waves@xcite . instead , in the case of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 couplings ,",
    "the amplitudes can only be estimated in the region of validity of the multichannel formalism , and the previous application of the optical theorem is clearly of no use .",
    "therefore one must use rapidly convergent dispersion relations , and this leads to choose the amplitude @xmath40 , even under crossing between @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels , for elastic @xmath43 and @xmath44 scattering .",
    "it has to be noted that these amplitudes , beside being rapidly decreasing as @xmath45 , exhibit a strong dependence on the p waves close to threshold .",
    "we also calculated the product of these couplings from the @xmath46 reaction , using this time the amplitude @xmath47 : this channel has been considered here for the first time , while the two elastic processes were already studied by other authors@xcite .",
    "however , the novelty of our calculation is not only in this part , and in the update of the inputs for the higher  energy ranges of the dispersive integrals , but also in the fact that for the first time we analysed the stability of the results with respect to the energy at which the dispersion relations were evaluated .",
    "this provides an important consistency check of the parametrization of the @xmath9 meson  barion interactions with fixed@xmath48 analyticity : we found indeed that @xmath1 amplitudes showed marked inconsistencies and , in order to investigate their sources , we analysed separately the contributions from each partial wave in the parametrization of the low  energy region , and in particular their dependences on the energy at which the dispersions relations were evaluated .",
    "such a separation is useful in building a priority scale for future experiments to be performed , for instance , at da@xmath3ne .",
    "for what concerns our calculations of the @xmath33 couplings , here we shall rapidly summarise the results of ref . [ 2 ] , to which we also refer for the details on the evaluation of the dispersive integrals .    in the case of @xmath43 elastic scattering we found that the value for @xmath49 evaluated at the @xmath0 threshold was in agreement with the similar calculation by chang and meiere@xcite .",
    "however , as we varied the energy at which the dispersion relation was evaluated , we found significant variations in the coupling as well , almost entirely due to the p@xmath50 wave , the remaining contributions having a smooth energy dependence , and accounting at the @xmath0 threshold for about 28.5 % of the value of @xmath49 .    in the case of @xmath44 elastic scattering , for which one has to use only the ( crossing  even ) combination of isospin amplitudes @xmath51 , in order to eliminate the unknown amplitude @xmath52 in both the @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 poles are present in the born term : thus a reasonable approach to the determination of @xmath55 is to combine the dispersion relation for this channel with the one for the @xmath43 channel ( calculated at the same c.m . energy ) , so that the @xmath53pole term in the first relation is exactly canceled by the @xmath54pole one in the second ( this was done as well by chan and meiere@xcite , although only at the @xmath0 threshold ) .",
    "our results for the @xmath38 coupling agree with chan ",
    "meiere s at the @xmath0 threshold , but away from it a complicated energy dependence appears , which in part can be ascribed both to the poor matching of kim s analysis to the input used for the intermediate ",
    "energy range of the integrals ( at the upper end of the energy interval covered by our calculations ) , and ( at the lower end of that interval ) to the @xmath53 pole falling on the cut between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 thresholds , so that the m  matrices can not describe correctly the real part of the amplitude in this energy region . between these two extremes ,",
    "the coupling shows a hump close to the @xmath0 threshold , which is again , as in the previous case , mostly due to the p@xmath50 wave .",
    "finally , when the @xmath56 reaction is analysed , one finds several inconsistencies : first , the product @xmath57 has a value close to zero at the @xmath0 threshold , in clear contrast with the values found by us and by ref .",
    "[ 11 ] for the separate couplings at the same energy .",
    "second , the product shows a marked dependence on the energy , going rapidly from positive to negative values : again , this seems to be mostly due to the p@xmath50 wave , whose contribution is negative over most of the range and rapidly decreasing .",
    "however , if the @xmath58 p waves are dropped from all three calculations , not only the couplings obtained show much smaller variations in the central part of the energy range covered by our calculations , but also the average values obtained from the three channels are rather consistent with each other ( and , incidentally , also with the expectations from flavour su(3 ) symmetry and the known value of @xmath59 ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that these waves were very poorly determined in kim s analysis , at least as far as their matrix elements in the @xmath1 channels are concerned .",
    "we have therefore analysed also the @xmath0 elastic scattering @xmath60 amplitudes by the same approach .",
    "it is convenient to recall again here that the dispersive evaluations of the @xmath34 couplings have usually involved the amplitudes @xmath36 , mainly sensitive to the s waves close to threshold .",
    "nevertheless , an old paper@xcite had indeed found an energy dependence in @xmath61 , which perhaps could have had something to do with the problems we have just pointed out with kim s @xmath58 p waves .",
    "the calculation of @xmath62 and @xmath63 was performed using the pure @xmath15 and 1 isospin combinations of @xmath0 @xmath60 amplitudes , using for the crossed @xmath64 channels the vpi phase shift analysis@xcite .",
    "we calculated a dispersion relation for the difference @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , @xmath60 are the @xmath0 , @xmath64 @xmath60 amplitudes , and @xmath67 was kept fixed while @xmath68 varied in the energy range covered by kim s parametrization ( unphysical range included ) .",
    "calculations were carried out for four values of @xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath64 c.m .",
    "energies of 1,468 , 1,500 , 1,530 and 1,560 mev : the results were very similar , so that we only present here those referring to the first value , i.e. to @xmath67 = 548 mev .",
    "the @xmath69 coupling constant @xmath70 exhibits a bump  like structure for a @xmath0 c.m .",
    "energy of about 1,300 through 1,450 mev , and a general trend to increase with c.m .",
    "energy over the whole energy range analysed by us , oscillating around a value of 19.5 in the central part of this range .",
    "the bump is coming from the contribution of the d@xmath71 wave , while the average slope comes mostly from the @xmath42channel @xmath64 contributions .",
    "no significant effect can be attributed to the p@xmath72 wave contribution .    in the case of the @xmath73 coupling",
    ", @xmath74 exhibits a dependence on the @xmath0 c.m .",
    "energy peaking around threshold , which is almost completely eliminated when the contributions from the p@xmath50 wave is dropped out .",
    "from these calculations it transpares that the only parametrisation of the @xmath9 , low  energy @xmath75 scattering , which includes waves up to @xmath23 , and appears to give a reliable description of the structure of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 channels in the @xmath0 unphysical region , is inconsistent with dispersion relations , and that also the vpi partial  wave analysis of @xmath64 scattering@xcite seems to meet some difficulties , at least for the combination @xmath76 .",
    "however , if one considers the many measurements possible in low ",
    "energy @xmath0initiated reactions , and the few ones actually performed in all previous experiments , it is possible to hold the optimistic wiev that with da@xmath3ne the situation might significantly improve . before discussing this in some detail ,",
    "let us recall that the use of more sophisticated tools of analysis , like those proposed in ref .",
    "[ 1c ] , can also shed more light on this subject .    going to the experimental perspectives",
    ", it has to be stressed that the parameters of the k  matrices are determined at the lowest energies from very few sources , measured usually a rather long time ago : they are the _ integrated _ cross sections for the reactions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and ( but without resolving the channels ) @xmath80 + neutrals .",
    "da@xmath3ne will make possible to analyse all these reactions and , with the calorimetric techniques employed by kloe , to resolve all charged and neutral channels ( and detecting the @xmath81 from @xmath82 decay to separate @xmath83 from @xmath84 ) , not only measuring the rates but also the differential distributions , at least to the statistical level to extract their lagrange coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the extemely good efficiency and spatial resolution of a kloe  like apparatus , of much smaller dimensions than its `` big brother '' due to the much shorter decay length of the @xmath87 with respect to that of the @xmath88 , will also allow measurements of the polarizations of the final ",
    "state @xmath53 and @xmath89 hyperons from the angular distributions of their decay products .",
    "the same measurements will also be possible for all @xmath90initiated processes , and , replacing hydrogen with deuterium , for @xmath91 and @xmath92initiated ones as well .",
    "already this amount of experimental information at laboratory momenta from about 110 down to about 90 mev / c ( the detector itself will act as a `` moderator '' for @xmath87 ) should lead to a much better knowledge of the k  matrices and to more reliable calculations of the quantities related to them , such as the @xmath29 coupling constants for the @xmath9 sector and the zero  energy values of the crossing  even amplitudes @xmath93 , which can lead to an estimate of the @xmath64 @xmath94terms@xcite .",
    "other interesting experiments will already be possible with existing detectors : kloe@xcite will surely be able to register all interactions of both @xmath87 and @xmath88 with the @xmath95he filling its wire chamber , interactions never observed before at such low lab .",
    "momenta , dear@xcite will measure the k lines of kaonic hydrogen ( and deuterium ) giving independent information on the @xmath0 s  wave scattering lengths ( with ccds covering much lower @xmath81ray energies they could also think about investigating the p waves through the study of the l lines as well ) , and finuda@xcite , though starting with a much narrower scope than kloe , will anyway be able to make some high quality measurements , in particular of the @xmath90 charge ",
    "exchange processes taking place in the hydrogen of its plastic scintillators@xcite .",
    "we hope with the present discussion to have offered at least part of the background we were referring to for the motivation of new , perhaps less fashionable than others , but nonetheless still very interesting experiments , several of which , despite the folklore about low ",
    "energy physics having been already adequately explored in the past , were never done before , and quite certainly not accomplishable anywhere else but at a @xmath2factory .",
