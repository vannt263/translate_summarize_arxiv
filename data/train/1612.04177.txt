    "the idea of extra dimensions is now firmly established in theoretical physics in many contexts , such as kaluza ",
    "klein theories , supergravity , strings and m - theory , brane - world theories .",
    "this idea provides a powerful methodological framework for many crucial problems : geometric unification of physical interactions , the hierarchy problem , possible variations of fundamental constants as well as searches for realistic cosmological scenarios including inflationary , string or brane backgrounds , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of the important problems in multidimensional models is inclusion of quantum vacuum effects due to the compact topology of extra dimensions ( the casimir effect @xcite ) .    in this paper , in the framework of a kaluza - klein - type theory including quadratic curvature invariants , we try to construct viable cosmological models taking into account the casimir energy of massless fields . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to vacuum models with the geometry @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an @xmath2-dimensional sphere of sufficiently small radius .",
    "we thus consider a @xmath3-dimensional manifold with the metric [ ds ] ds^2 = gdx^dx^- ^2(x^ ) d_n^2 where @xmath4 are the observable four space - time coordinates , and @xmath5 is the metric on a unit sphere @xmath1 . in this space - time",
    ", we consider a curvature - nonlinear theory of gravity with the action [ act1 ] s = ^d-2 d^dx ( f(r ) + c_1 r^abr_ab + c_2 r^abcdr_abcd + l_m ) , where capital latin indices cover all @xmath6 coordinates , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a smooth function of @xmath6-dimensional scalar curvature @xmath9 , @xmath10 are constants , @xmath11 is a matter lagrangian , and @xmath12 is the @xmath6-dimensional planck mass , thus @xmath13 is a fundamental length in this theory .",
    "we use the system of units with @xmath14 . as @xmath11",
    ", we consider the casimir energy density in the geometry .",
    "our goal is to find viable models describing the present - day universe . to this end , following the methodology of @xcite , we simplify the problem as follows :    integrate over @xmath1 , reducing all quantities to 4d variables and @xmath15 ; thus we have [ r4 ] r = r_4 + + f_1 , f_1 = 2 n + n(n+1 ) ( ) ^2 , where @xmath16 $ ] is the 4d scalar curvature , @xmath17 is the 4d dalembert operator , @xmath18 , and the effective scalar field is equal to the ricci scalar of @xmath1 : [ phi ] ( x^ ) = ^2n ( n-1)^-2(x^ ) .",
    "suppose slow variations of all quantities as compared with the @xmath6-dimensional planck scale , i.e. , associate each derivative @xmath19 with a small parameter @xmath20 and neglect all quantities of orders higher than @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation is justified in almost all thinkable situations .",
    "the 4d formulation of the theory has the form of a scalar - tensor theory in a jordan conformal frame .",
    "we perform a transition to the einstein frame , more suitable for studying the dynamics of the scalar field @xmath22 since in this frame it is minimally coupled to the 4d curvature .    in the expression ( [ r4 ] ) , only @xmath22 has the order @xmath23 while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , [ fapprox ] f(r ) = f(+ r_4 + f_1 ) f ( ) + f ( r_4 + f_1 ) + o(^2 ) , where @xmath26 .",
    "thus the 4d ( jordan - frame ) action obtained from takes the form [ act2 ] s = ^2 d^4 x , where @xmath27 is the volume of a unit sphere @xmath1 , and k_j ^n , v_j ( ) ^n [ -f ( ) - c_j ^-4 + 2 c_n r_0 ^ -2 f ^-(n + 4 ) ] .",
    "the dimensionless constants @xmath28 are factors characterizing the casimir energy density @xcite , written in such a way that it contributes to the @xmath29 component of the total stress - energy tensor of matter in the theory .",
    "the constant @xmath30 is defined as [ cj ] c_j = r_0 ^ -4 n(n-1 ) [ ( n-1)c_1 + 2c_2 ]    a transition to the einstein frame is carried out using the conformal mapping [ trans - g ] g= |f()| g ,   f ( ) = ^nf_. the resulting action in the einstein frame has the form [ act3 ] s ( n ) ^2 d^4x , + [ ke ] k_e 6 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 -2 n + n ( n+2 ) + , + [ ve ] v_e ( ) = , where the tilde marks quantities obtained from or with @xmath31 . in what follows we will try to build viable cosmologies in the theory that follows from under the above assumptions . to be consistent with observations in the present - day universe , we should require :    \\1 . the space - time is described classically ,",
    "therefore the size @xmath32 of the extra dimensions should exceed the fundamental length scale @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the extra dimensions should not be directly observable , hence @xmath36 cm , which corresponds to the tev energy scale .",
    "the model parameters should conform to observations : so , our 3d space should expand with acceleration , and the famous cosmological constant problem should be somehow addressed .",
    "we will discuss two kinds of models : one based on a minimum of @xmath37 and another one with slowly evolving extra dimensions .",
    "following @xcite , let us suppose , for simplicity , @xmath38 , hence @xmath39 , so that the nonlinearity of the theory is only contained in terms with @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the action , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44",
    ". let us also choose for specific calculations @xmath45 , then [ wx ] w(x ) = x^3 - 3 x^5 - k_2 x^7 + k_3 x^10 , where @xmath46 ; the quantity @xmath47 is dimensionless as well as the constants [ ve2 ] = r_0 ^ 2 _ d ,  k_1 = n(n-1)/2 , k_2 = r_0 ^ 2 c_j/2 ,  k_3 = c_n /.",
    "we seek a minimum of @xmath47 at some @xmath48 , corresponding to a stable stationary state of @xmath49 provided that @xmath50 .     for @xmath45 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( bottom - up ) ; ( b ) plot of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 for the same values of @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=170 ]   for @xmath45 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( bottom - up ) ;",
    "( b ) plot of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 for the same values of @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=170 ]    let us estimate @xmath58 in the casimir term . according to @xcite , @xmath59 for the vacuum density of a single massless scalar field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 , and one should recall that there is a number of degrees of freedom in 7d space - time , able to increase the casimir energy density by a factor of @xmath61 .",
    "thus we can take @xmath62 for our qualitative estimates . since the expected values of @xmath63 are small ( say , @xmath64 ) , the term with @xmath58 weakly affects our search for a minimum .",
    "next , without this term but with @xmath65 , there can not be a minimum of @xmath47 at @xmath66 , so we take @xmath67 .",
    "examples of such minima for @xmath68 are shown in figure 1 , where the right panel shows the dependence of @xmath69 on the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "one can also verify that @xmath50 at @xmath70 .",
    "thus one can easily obtain an arbitrarily small positive value of @xmath55 by properly choosing the value of @xmath56 .",
    "in cosmology this leads to viable models with @xmath71 , in particular , to the de sitter isotropic model in the absence of matter other than the casimir vacuum contribution .    for further estimates ,",
    "we should decide which conformal frame corresponds to observations , and this in turn depends on how fermions should be described in a ( so far unknown ) underlying theory of all interactions .",
    "we consider two opportunities , the einstein frame with the action , and the jordan frame , directly obtained from the d - dimensional theory .    in the * einstein frame * , by , the 4d planck mass is @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "hence for @xmath74 the size of extra dimensions is @xmath75 , close to the planck length @xmath76 cm as long as @xmath77 is not far from unity .",
    "the effective cosmological constant is @xmath78 , and to conform to observations which require @xmath79 , fine tuning is necessary : @xmath56 should be close to the value at which @xmath80 ( see figure 1 , right ) with an accuracy close to @xmath81 .",
    "the casimir contribution to @xmath47 is very large as compared to @xmath82 : e.g. , with the parameter values used in the figure , this contribution is @xmath83 .",
    "this comparatively large value is compensated by fine - tuned values of other parameters of the theory .    in the * jordan frame * , the 4d planck mass is related to @xmath84 by [ r0j ] ^2 = 1/r_0 ^ 2 = m_4 ^ 2 ( n)^-1 x_0^n . since @xmath85",
    ", @xmath13 is in general a few orders of magnitude larger than the planck length , which at large enough @xmath2 may be in tension with the invisibility of extra dimensions .",
    "the effective cosmological constant in the jordan frame is obtained if we present the integrand in as @xmath86 $ ] , which leads to @xmath87 . however , expressing @xmath13 in terms of @xmath84 , we arrive again at the expression @xmath88 .",
    "thus we need the same fine tuning as in the einstein frame and have the same estimate of the casimir contribution to @xmath47 , despite another value of the fundamental length @xmath33 .",
    "a viable model with slowly evolving extra dimensions can be obtained , by analogy with @xcite , from the same einstein - frame action ",
    ", where now we should focus on the minimum of @xmath47 at @xmath89 ( see figure 1 , left panel for illustration ) and a slow decrease of @xmath90 to zero , so that @xmath91 , still remaining small enough to conform to observations .",
    "consider 4d isotropic , spatially flat cosmologies with @xmath2-dimensional spherical extra space : [ ds2 ] ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t ) dx^2 - b^2(t ) d_n^2 .",
    "we now keep @xmath2 arbitrary .",
    "two independent field equations for the unknowns @xmath92 and @xmath93 are [ fr ] = k_e ^2 + v_e ( ) , + [ be ] 2k_e ( + ) + ^2 + = 0 .",
    "it turns out that the assumption @xmath94 now does not lead to a good solution . instead , following @xcite , we can choose @xmath95 , which leads to the following expressions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 : k_e = k_0 = 14 [ n^2 -2n + 12 + 4(c_1+c_2 ) ] , v_e = 1 8n^2(n-1)^2 , where we have put for convenience @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 .",
    "one sees that the required minimum of @xmath100 at @xmath101 takes place for @xmath102 , and it is clear that the casimir term with @xmath103 again can only weakly affect the solution .",
    "neglecting also the second term in @xmath100 ( with @xmath104 ) , it is easy to find a slow - rolling solution , satisfying the conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 @xcite : [ ab_t ] a(t ) = a_1 ( t + t_1)^p , b(t ) = b_0 ( ) ^1/ , where p = ,   = ,   b_0 = ( ) ^1/ ; @xmath107 and @xmath108 are integration constants , @xmath109 is the present age of the universe , and @xmath110 is the hubble constant : @xmath111 at @xmath112 .",
    "the solution satisfies the slow - rolling conditions if @xmath113 ( which in turn requires @xmath114 ) , and in this case it describes power - law inflation and a very slow increase of the size @xmath115 of extra dimensions .",
    "the 4d planck mass is @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath2 is not too large ( say , @xmath116 ) , we can suppose @xmath117 , so we work with approximately the conventional 4d planck units .",
    "from we can estimate the input parameter @xmath56 ( the initial dimensionless cosmological constant ) in terms of the present - day size @xmath118 @xcite : 316 n^2(n-1)^2 b_0^n-4 10 ^ -120 . to keep the extra dimensions invisible ,",
    "we should put @xmath119 .",
    "it is clear that at some admissible values of @xmath2 and @xmath120 the quantity @xmath56 will be of the order of unity , for instance , it happens at @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus the cosmological constant problem can be solved in this framework without fine tuning .",
    "these estimates have been made in the einstein frame .",
    "as to jordan s , it turns out @xcite that the same solution leads to a model incompatible with observations : the cosmological expansion is too strongly accelerated ( for the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath123 we have @xmath124 while observations imply @xmath125 ) and leads to a big rip .",
    "in curvature - nonlinear multidimensional gravity with spherical extra dimensions , we have presented two simple examples of cosmological models approximately describing the present stage of the universe evolution : one with a suitable minimum of the effective potential , corresponding to a stable stationary size @xmath126 of the extra dimensions , the other in which this size is very slowly growing .",
    "the second model differs from the first one in the following features : ( i ) a larger dimension @xmath2 is required , ( ii ) no fine tuning of the initial parameters is necessary , ( iii ) the casimir contribution to the total energy density is insignificant , and ( iv ) only the einstein frame is viable .    among possible interesting extensions of this work there is a study of variations of fundamental constants depending on the size of extra dimensions , including the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath127 and the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath128 , a possible application of such models to the early ( inflationary ) universe with maybe quantum tunneling between different minima of the potential , and , certainly , a consideration of other geometries of extra dimensions , e.g. , in the form of products of spherical , toroidal and/or hyperbolic factor spaces .",
