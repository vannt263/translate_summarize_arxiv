    "relativistic dirac approaches based on the dirac equation have been very successful in treating nuclear reactions @xcite . because the dirac analyses have proven to be very successful in describing the intermediate - energy proton elastic scatterings from the spherically symmetric nuclei and a few deformed nuclei @xcite , the relativistic approaches based on the dirac equation are expanded to inelastic scatterings and have shown considerable improvements compared to the conventional nonrelativistic calculations based on the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the relativistic effect is taken into account at the level of the kinematics in the nonrelativistic calculations based on the schrdinger equation , because it is no longer negligible for the intermediate - energy proton scattering .",
    "but the relativistic kinematics correction seems not to be enough , so the fully relativistic treatment based on the use of the dirac equation seems to be required for the description of intermediate - energy proton scattering .",
    "it should be noted that one of the merit of the relativistic approach based on the dirac equation instead of using the nonrelativistic approach based on the schrdinger equation is that the spin - orbit potential appears naturally in the dirac approach when the dirac equation is reduced to a schrdinger - like second - order differential equation , while the spin - orbit potential should be inserted by hand in the nonrelativistic schrdinger approach in order to describe the intermediate energy nucleon scattering from the nucleus .    in this work we performed the dirac coupled channel analyses for the high - lying excited states of s - d shell nuclei @xmath1 mg and @xmath2 mg that belong to the @xmath3 gamma vibrational band at polarized 800-mev proton inelastic scattering .",
    "dirac phenomenological optical potentials are used , employing the s - v optical potential model @xcite where only scalar and time - like vector potentials are considered .",
    "the woods - saxon shape is used for the geometry of the direct optical potentials , assuming the shape of the potential follows the shape of the nuclear density . in order to accommodate the collective motion of the excited deformed nucleus considering the high - lying excited states of 2@xmath0 gamma vibrational band ,",
    "the first - order vibrational collective model is used to obtain the transition optical potentials @xcite .",
    "the complicated dirac coupled - channel equations are solved phenomenologically to reproduce the experimental data by varying the optical potential and deformation parameters , using a computer program called ecis @xcite .",
    "the effect of the multistep process is investigated by including the channel coupling between two adjacent excited states in addition to the couplings between the ground state and the excited states .",
    "the calculated results are analyzed and compared with the experimental data and the results obtained from the nonrelativistic approaches .",
    "relativistic dirac coupled channel analyses are performed phenomenologically for the high - lying excited states of the 2@xmath0 gamma vibrational band at @xmath1 mg ( p , p@xmath4 ) and @xmath2 mg ( p , p@xmath4 ) by using an optical potential model and the first - order vibrational collective model . because @xmath1 mg and @xmath2 mg are the spin-0 nuclei , only scalar , time - like vector and tensor optical potentials survive @xcite , as in spherically symmetric nuclei @xcite , hence the relevant dirac equation for the elastic scattering from the nucleus is given as    @xmath5 \\psi(r ) = 0 \\label{e1}\\ ] ]    here",

    "however , depending on the model assumed , pseudo - scalar and axial - vector potentials may also be present in the equation when we consider inelastic scattering .",
    "we assume , in the collective model approach used in this work , that the appropriate transition potentials can be obtained by deforming the direct potentials that describe the elastic channel reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the deformed potentials are assumed to follow the shape of the deformed nuclear densities and the transition potentials are obtained by assuming that they are proportional to the first - order derivatives of the diagonal potentials @xcite . as direct potentials , the scalar and the time - like vector potentials are used in the calculation .",
    "tensor potentials are always present due to the interaction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the projectile with the charge distribution of the target .",
    "however , the tensor potentials are neglected in this calculation because they have been found to be always very small compared to scalar or vector potentials @xcite . the evidence that the large scalar and vector fields of dirac phenomenology may be related to quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon",
