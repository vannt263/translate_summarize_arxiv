    "_ ab initio _ many - body quantum mechanical calculations are crucially important to our understanding of the behavior of atomic , molecular and condensed matter systems .",
    "it is well known that prediction of the behavior of these systems requires the description of electronic correlation . whilst density - functional theory ( dft ) in the local - density approximation ( lda ) does this with startling success in many cases , it does so at the expense of a non - physical electron self - interaction . for delocalized electron systems this self - interaction becomes negligible , but in atomic or strongly localized electronic systems it plays an important role . if one is interested in the calculation of quasiparticle excitation spectra , many - body perturbation - theory ( mbpt ) is formally a correct way to proceed . for solids ,",
    "mbpt in hedin s @xmath0 approximation @xcite has become the method of choice , but it is also increasingly being applied to molecular systems and clusters .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy can be decomposed into correlation and exchange parts , where the latter is the same as the fock operator encountered in hartree - fock theory and thus self - interaction free .",
    "while the exact self - energy must also be free of self - interaction , the correlation part of the @xmath0 self - energy does not have this property . to investigate the influence of self - interaction in the @xmath0 approach",
    "the hydrogen atom provides an ideal case , because the exact solution is known analytically .",
    "hydrogen in its solid phase has previously been studied within the @xmath0 approximation by li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who analyzed the transition between the high - pressure solid phase and the low density , atomic - like limit . for individual atoms , @xmath0 electron removal and addition energies ( we use the term `` quasiparticle '' energies by analogy with the solid - state situation ) have been investigated by shirley and martin @xcite , dahlen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , stan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and delaney _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , although hydrogen was not considered .",
    "these studies have shown that @xmath0 , in general , gives quasiparticle properties which are much improved over dft and hartree - fock methods , even for atoms .    in this paper",
    "we use the hydrogen atom as a benchmark system to quantify the self - interaction error in the @xmath0 approach .",
    "since the self - energy diagrams _ beyond _ @xmath0 , known as the vertex correction , must by definition correct this self - interaction error , our findings are relevant for research into vertex functions for the many - electron problem .",
    "attention has recently focused on the prospects for improving the usual non - self - consistent @xmath0 calculations by choosing an initial green s function , @xmath1 , that is physically more reasonable than the lda ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we explore this here by determining the sensitivity of the self - interaction error to the use of the exact hydrogenic orbitals and energies in place of those from the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we also assess the error introduced into @xmath0 calculations by employing first - order perturbation theory in solving the quasiparticle equation ( as opposed to the full numerical solution ) , and we analyze the quasiparticle wavefunctions that emerge from a full solution .",
    "in many - body perturbation theory the quasiparticle excitation energies @xmath2 and wavefunctions @xmath3 are the solutions of the quasiparticle equation @xmath4 where , in hartree atomic units , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the external potential .",
    "it is customary to divide the mass operator @xmath7 into the local hartree potential ( @xmath8 ) and the non - local self - energy ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 omitting correlation contributions from @xmath9 yields the exact - exchange or hartree - fock case , where the self - energy takes the form @xmath11 and the hartree potential is given by @xmath12 since the sum runs over all occupied states the hartree potential contains an artificial interaction of electrons with themselves .",
    "for the hydrogen atom this so - called self - interaction of the electron is the _ only _ content of the hartree potential and may be calculated analytically using the exact ground - state wavefunction @xmath13 as @xmath14 the self - interaction is a positive , decreasing function and hence tends to delocalize the wavefunction ( i.e. incorrectly pushes its weight away from the nucleus ) .    in hartree - fock",
    "the self - interaction terms introduced in the hartree potential are exactly canceled by the fock operator @xmath15 .",
    "this makes hartree - fock exact for one - electron systems such as the hydrogen atom .",
    "however , the lack of correlation renders hartree - fock unsuitable for many polyatomic systems of interest .    of more practical use",
    "is kohn - sham @xcite density - functional theory , which by virtue of the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite establishes an exact and universal functional relationship between the ground - state density @xmath16 and the total energy @xmath17 of a system .",
    "mapping the system of interacting electrons onto a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons , that reproduces the exact density , yields the kohn - sham equations : @xmath18     \\phi_{i\\sigma}({\\bf r } )      = \\epsilon_{i\\sigma}^{\\rm ks } \\phi_{i\\sigma}({\\bf r}).\\ ] ] all electron - electron interactions beyond the hartree mean field are encompassed by the exchange - correlation potential @xmath19 , which is formally given as the functional derivative of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath20 : @xmath21}{\\delta n({\\bf r } ) } \\quad .\\ ] ] in analogy to the quasiparticle equation ( [ qpe : full ] ) the kohn - sham eigenvalues @xmath22 are often interpreted as excitation energies , although this is not formally justified .",
    "one of the most common approximations for @xmath23 is the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite , in which the many - body exchange and correlation contributions to the total energy ( @xmath20 ) are included by comparison with the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) : @xmath24=\\int \\ !",

    "the lda has been remarkably successful at accounting for correlation even in systems that are highly inhomogeneous . however , it is well known that the introduction of correlation in the lda comes at the expense of the exact treatment of the self - interaction . because the exchange functional is taken from the homogeneous electron gas it no - longer cancels the spurious self - interaction present in the hartree term . in most systems",
    "this is a minor effect and is more than compensated by the improved treatment of the electron correlation .",
    "the lda can be improved by explicitly removing the self - interaction @xcite , however this becomes increasingly difficult as the system s complexity is increased .",
    "in hedin s @xmath0 approximation @xcite the self - energy in eq .",
    "[ eq : m ] is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an infinitesimal positive time . at the level of @xmath0 , spin flips are not accounted for @xcite , and the input green s function is diagonal in its spin representation @xmath28    in common with usual @xmath0 calculations , a kohn - sham green s function @xmath29 is used for @xmath30 , given by @xcite @xmath31 and makes the non - interacting polarizability @xmath32 and the dielectric function spin - dependent ( though spin - diagonal ) .",

[ eq : s = gw ] ) .    for numerical convenience and physical insight",
    "we separate the @xmath0 self - energy ( [ eq : s = gw ] ) according to @xmath35                         = \\sigma_{\\sigma\\sigma}^x+\\sigma_{\\sigma\\sigma}^c   \\quad.\\ ] ] the first term ( @xmath36 ) corresponds to the fock operator in eq .",
    "[ eq : hf ] and will exactly cancel the self - interaction introduced by the hartree potential .",
    "it is therefore immediately clear that any deviation from the exact result for hydrogen can only come from the correlation part of the self - energy ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the incorrect self - interaction affects the electron removal energies ( here , the ionization potential ) . for electron addition energies such as the electron affinity",
    ", the entire hartree potential has a physically reasonable interpretation , since it acts on the wavefunction of the originally unoccupied state which has not contributed to the electron density .",
    "we solve the quasiparticle equation ( [ qpe : full ] ) with the @xmath38 self - energy ( [ eq : s = gw ] ) for the quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions by fully diagonalizing the quasiparticle hamiltonian in the basis of the single particle orbitals of the non - interacting system .",
    "since the ground state of the hydrogen atom ( eq . [ eq : h_wfc ] ) is spherically symmetric , it is sufficient to describe all non - local operators in the @xmath0 formalism by two radial and one spin coordinates , @xmath39 and one angular coordinate , @xmath40 , that denotes the angle between the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the self - energy ( eq . [ eq : s = gw ] ) then assumes the much simpler form @xmath43                                 p_l(\\cos\\theta ) \\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a legendre polynomial of order @xmath45 .",
    "the legendre expansion coefficients of the self - energy are calculated directly , thereby surpassing the need for a numerical treatment of the angular dependence .",
    "we use a real - space and imaginary time representation @xcite to calculate the self - energy from the non - interacting green s function @xmath1 .",
    "the expression for the self - energy on the real frequency axis is obtained by analytic continuation @xcite .",
    "the current implementation has been successfully applied to jellium clusters @xcite and light atoms @xcite .",
    "our code allows us to solve the quasiparticle equation ( [ qpe : full ] ) for the @xmath0 self - energy with no further approximation .",
    "however , in order to separate the contribution that arises from the correlation part of the self - energy from that of the exchange part and the hartree and exchange - correlation potential we _ also _ solve the quasiparticle equation with the frequently made approximation that the quasiparticle wavefunctions are given by the kohn - sham wavefunctions .",
    "the resulting equation for the quasiparticle energies is @xmath46 where the brackets @xmath47 denote matrix elements with respect to the kohn - sham wavefunction @xmath48 .    in order to explore the role of the starting points for a @xmath0 calculation ,",
    "two possible kohn - sham input green s functions are chosen .",
    "first , the familiar lda , and , second , the exact kohn - sham solution for the hydrogen atom which has the exact wavefunction of the hydrogen 1@xmath49 state ( [ eq : h_wfc ] ) and @xmath50 .",
    "( this exact kohn - sham green s function , incidentally , differs from the exact green s function of the hydrogen atom , because the exact kohn - sham unoccupied eigenvalues do not signify electron affinities .",
    "the exact green s function can not be constructed from any orthonormal set of one - particle wavefunctions . )",
    "the calculated ionization potentials ( from a full solution of the quasiparticle equation ) are shown in table [ tab : qpe ] .",
    "the self - interaction errors in the two @xmath0 quasiparticle energies are seen to be fairly small : 0.95 ev when the approximate lda kohn - sham starting point is used , and the much smaller 0.21 ev when the exact kohn - sham starting point is used .",
    "clearly the lda is such a physically poor representation of the correct physics in this extreme system ( owing to the large self - interaction present in the lda calculation itself , as reflected in the large error in the lda kohn - sham eigenvalue ) that it forms a very unsuitable starting point for @xmath0 .",
    "however , a physically reasonable starting point reduces the @xmath0 self - interaction error to a small size .",

    "for comparison , the hartree - fock ( hf ) and lda eigenvalues are also shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since @xmath51 gives a non - vanishing contribution to the hydrogen 1@xmath49 state , even if the analytic solution is used as a starting point , the quasiparticle wavefunction will differ from the exact one .",
    "figure [ fig : wfc ] shows that the @xmath0 correlation gives rise to a slight delocalization of the quasiparticle wavefunction in this case .",
    "this relaxation , however , now makes the quasiparticle wavefunction an eigenfunction of the quasiparticle hamiltonian and reduces the deviation from the exact energy of the 1@xmath49 state to 0.2  ev , as shown in table [ tab : qpe ] . in the lda",
    "the self - interaction error is much more pronounced and the wavefunction becomes significantly more delocalized .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy corrects this to a small extent ( as reflected in the quasiparticle wavefunction ) , but the remaining discrepancy reiterates the unsuitability of the lda as a starting point for @xmath0 in this self - interaction - dominated atom .    for an analysis of the contributions to the self - energy we turn to the perturbative solution of the quasiparticle equation using eq .",
    "[ eq : qpeit ] , shown in table [ tab : contrib ] .",
    "when the exact kohn - sham wavefunction and eigenvalues are used , as in the hartree - fock case the exchange part of the self - energy is seen to cancel the self - interaction contribution from the hartree potential exactly .",
    "the correlation part , on the other hand , is not zero , but amounts to a self - polarization of 0.25  ev .",
    "when the lda is used as starting point the influence of the lda wavefunction on the exchange operator becomes apparent and it reduces from @xmath5217.00  ev in the exact case to @xmath5215.38  ev .",
    "this corrects the highly overestimated lda eigenvalue for the 1@xmath49 state of @xmath526.36  ev ( see table [ tab : qpe ] ) to @xmath5213.49  ev .",
    "however , in this case the contribution from the correlation part of the @xmath0 self - energy is even larger than when starting from the exact case and increases the quasiparticle energy to @xmath5212.93  ev .",
    "we have performed spin - resolved benchmark calculations for the @xmath0 formalism using the analytically known solutions of the hydrogen atom as a reference , making the self - interaction error introduced by the correlation part of the @xmath0 self - energy directly assessable . when the exact kohn - sham green s function is used as the input to @xmath0 ,",
    "the self - interaction error is small ( 0.21  ev , one - thirtieth the size of that in the lda ) , but not negligible . if the lda kohn - sham green s function is used , as done in many @xmath0 calculations for more complex systems , a larger self - interaction error remains , inherited from the lda starting point .",
