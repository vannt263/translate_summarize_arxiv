    "nanoscopic structures coupled to superconductors has attracted the attention of many researchers over the last two decades@xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of nanostructured systems such as quantum dots coupled to normal or superconducting contacts is their flexibility to study many different phenomena , such as the kondo effect@xcite , the andreev bound states ( abs ) , etc . due to confinement ,",
    "quantum dot systems exhibit a discrete spectrum that can be modified by local gates , allowing for a fine control of their physical properties .",
    "when a quantum dot is connected to a conventional superconductor , multiple andreev reflections between the quantum dot and the superconductor give rise to andreev bound states ( abs ) in the dot@xcite , with signature visible in their transport properties@xcite .",
    "for example , by studying a graphene quantum dot coupled to a normal and to a superconductor contacts , dirks et al@xcite have observed sharp _ in gap _ conductance peaks attributed to individual abs in the system .",
    "another interesting result is the interplay between the kondo screening and the superconducting pairing in quantum dots observed by pillet et al@xcite .",
    "interplay between kondo and andreev bound states has also been studied earlier by franke and coworkers@xcite , in magnetic molecules on the surface of a superconductor .",
    "more recently , quantum dots coupled to topological superconductor wires@xcite supporting majorana bound states ( mbs ) in their ends have also attracted a lot of attention . besides the interest in the fundamental concepts of the majorana state physics@xcite",
    ", it is also potentially useful for topologically protected quantum computation@xcite . despite the great effort of various researchers toward experimental observation@xcite",
    ", no much progress have been made lately .",
    "one of the most challenging task for a clear observation of mbs features in condensed matter systems is to tell apart features from other phenomena , as it has been argued that mbs may be confused with signatures from kondo or abs .",
    "for instance , it has been shown by one of us that , under certain regime , the majorana and the kondo physics can coexist in a quantum dot that is simultaneously coupled to a topological superconductor and to a metallic contact@xcite . therefore , identifying features of a particular phenomena can be experimentally puzzling .",
    "while the interplay between the majorana and the kondo effect have been investigated in some detail , very little attention have been devoted to mbs and abs together@xcite .",
    "for instance , do mbs and abs mix together ? more importantly , if the mbs and abs coexist in some regime , how can one distinguish them experimentally ?",
    "the answer to these important questions still remain unclear .",
    "aiming to addressing these questions , in this work we investigate possible coexistence and interplay between andreev and majorana bound states in a single and double dot systems .",
    "we consider a double quantum dot system in which one of the dots is coupled to a conventional superconductor while the other couples to topological superconductor .",
    "the quantum dot are interconnected by a controllable tunneling barrier that allows us to drive the system from a single to a double dot configurations , providing a flexible structure to address possible mixing of mbs and abs . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "our system , schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "it resembles the one proposed by pillet et al , in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", however , while the left quantum dot ( qd1 ) is coupled to a normal @xmath0-wave superconductor ( sc1 ) the right one ( qd2 ) is connected to a topological superconductor that provides the majorana bound state .",
    "furthermore , each of the qds are coupled to individual metallic leads labeled by ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( see fig .  [ model ] ) that induces a natural broadening of the qd levels .",
    "when the qds are decoupled from each other , if the sc2 is in its topological phase , a majorana mode will appear in the qd2 , as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , while in the qd1 there will be a pair o abss .    to study the bound states we focus mainly on the spectral properties of the system , that is accessible via zero - bias differential conductance measurement as in experiment reported in ref .",
    "we employ the standard recursive green s function approach , from which we can obtain numerically exact results for the local density of states of the system .",
    "we first study the situation in which the qds are fully decoupled from each other . in this configuration",
    "we monitor the local density of states of the qd2 while driving the sc2 from its trivial to its topological phase .",
    "we show that the mbs and the abss appear in two distinct regimes , that can be distinguished in tunneling spectroscopy measurements .",
    "we then go on and study possible coexistence of mbs and abs in the double dot configuration . to do",
    "so we couple the two qds by making the interdot coupling finite .",
    "we find that in the trivial phase of the sc2 and in the atomic limit ( small interdot coupling ) the dot coupled to the normal superconductor exhibits the usual andreev bound states whereas the other one exhibits a atomic single particle peak . in the molecular regime ( strong interdot coupling ) , the andreev states take over the entire molecule , appearing clearly in the molecular orbitals .",
    "more interestingly , in the topological phase of the sc2 , in the atomic regime we see andreev bound states in the qd1 and a majorana zero mode in the qd2 . in the molecular regime , on the other hand , while the andreev bound states is seen over entire molecule , the majorana mode ( seen only for spin _ down _ ) is always bound to an atomic orbital .",

    "indeed , as we have seen previously , this zero - energy peak corresponds to the majorana mode bound to the qd2 .",
    "similarly to what we have done in the single dot configuration , we now discuss how these features of the double - dot configuration could be observed within the current available experimental technology .",
    "this has to be done via local @xmath133 measurement as in ref .",
    "this is because in this configuration , the transport measurement between our lead 3 and 4 would not provide a local spectroscopy of the density of states of the qds , individually .",
    "therefore , similarly to the single - dot configuration , the stm tip can be placed on top of an individual qd .",
    "the zero - energy feature of our plots could be obtained experimentally by fixing the gate voltage of the dots and controlling the interdot coupling , while measuring the @xmath133 from the leads into the stm tip .",
    "figure  [ tunneling ] shows the zero - energy ldos vs interdot coupling for both trivial and topological phase of the sc2 for each qd , individually .",
    "the features seen in this figure were already present in the previous one but here , some of them are more apparent and deserves to be discussed .",
    "first , as we already noted earlier , we see that in the trivial regime ( @xmath134 ) , even though the @xmath81 is finite the dos is degenerate for spin _ up _ and _ down_. this is because the application of a small zeeman field in the sc2 does not affect the ldos of the dots since there is no in - gap states of the sc2 that couples to the dot .",
    "this is not the case in the topological phase of the sc2 in which there is a mbs .",
    "further , note the difference between the ldos of the qd1 and qd2 .",
    "note that for @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( top panels ) .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath137 for @xmath114 results from the presence of the andreev bound states in the qd1 . for @xmath138",
    ", we see that both @xmath139 ( both spins ) decreases as the andreev bound states take over the entire molecule . in the topological regime ( bottom ) , the presence of the mbs leaked into the qd2 is manifested for @xmath72 as @xmath140 , in agreement to what some of us have reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as @xmath98 increases , we see that @xmath141 decreases while @xmath142 increases , approaching @xmath143 , because the mbs leaks into the qd1 .",
    "finally , as remarkable signature of the mbs , when we look only into the qd1 we note that while @xmath144 decreases and @xmath142 decreases for @xmath138 , which produces strong polarization that could be detected using a spin polarized stm tip .",
    "another interesting point is that the signature of the topological quantum phase transition is still seen in the local density of states in the double dot configuration . to show this , in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] we show the zero - energy density of states of the individual quantum dots vs @xmath29 for the both , the atomic ( @xmath145 ) and the molecular regime ( @xmath146 ) in the top and lower panel , respectively . in the atomic regime ( top panels )",
    "we see that a jump in the @xmath141 at @xmath147 . on the other hand , in the molecular regime ( lower panels )",
    "the jump is overwhelmingly more pronounced in @xmath142 [ fig  [ figure10](b ) ] than the one observed in @xmath141 [ fig  [ figure10](d ) ] . for the spin _ up _ local density of states [ diamonds ( blue ) ] , for both regimes and in both qds we do not see any substantial change . the small jump in @xmath148 noticed in fig .",
    "[ figure10](d ) [ diamond ( blue ) line ] results from a weak mixture of spin _ up _ and _ down _ in molecular regime due to andreev scatterings .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ figure10 ] tell us that the topological quantum phase transition , well discussed in the single dot case , manifests itself even when the mbs and the abss coexist in the double double dot configuration .",
    "moreover , alike in the single dot system , these features can be experimentally accessed in a simple spectroscopic tunneling measurement .",
    "summarizing , we have studied the appearance of andreev and majorana bound states in a double quantum dot system . by studying the decoupled qds configuration , we have shown that the mbs and the abs can not coexist in a single dot .",
    "this is because in the low - density regime ( necessary for the topological phase of the superconductor ) the electron - hole asymmetry suppresses the abs . in the coupled dot configuration , one of the qds ( qd1 )",
    "is coupled to a conventional superconductor that provides the andreev bound states while the other ( qd2 ) is coupled to a topological superconductor , providing the majorana bound state in its topological phase .",
    "we show that in the trivial phase of the sc2 , in the atomic limit of the system where the interdot coupling is much smaller than the level broadening of the qds ( @xmath132) the qd1 exhibits andreev bound states while the qd2 exhibits a regular fermion state broadened by @xmath121 . when the system is brought into its molecular regime ( @xmath52 ) , the andreev bound states take over the entire molecule .",
    "more interestingly behavior occurs in the topological phase of the sc2 . in this situation ,",
    "we show that for @xmath51 there are andreev bound states in the qd1 for both spin components , while in the qd2 we find a majorana bound state for spin _ down _ and andreev bound states for spin _ up_. in the molecular regime , on the other hand , the majorana bound state leaks from the qd2 into the qd1 , while the andreev bound state can be seen in the entire molecule for the spin _ up _ component .",
    "these results reveal that , differently from the single dot case , the majorana and the andreev bound states coexist ; while andreev bound states can appear in molecular orbitals , the majorana bound states is always bound to an atomic orbital .",
    "another important feature that merits to be highlighted here is the remarkable signature of the topological quantum phase transition , manifested as a sharp jump in the zero - energy local density of states of the quantum dots , persisting even in the double dot case , in which the majorana and the andreev bound states coexist .",
    "finally , we believe our results are relevant from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints and should stimulate future spectral tunneling measurements to detect the signatures of majorana and andreev bound states in the double dot system proposed here .    we would like to thank the brazilians agencies capes , cnpq ( grant n. 449488/2014 - 4 ) and fapemig ( grant n. apq-02344 - 14 ) for financial support .",
