    "the near - earth space , filled by more than 300000 artificial debris particles with diameter larger than 1 cm , can be divided into three main regions : the low earth orbit ( leo ) , below about 2000 km , the medium earth orbit ( meo ) , above 2000 km and below 36000 km , and the geosynchronous earth orbit ( geo ) at about 36000 km of altitude .",
    "currently the orbits of more than 12000 objects larger than about 10 cm are listed in the so called two line elements ( tle ) catalogue . to produce and maintain such a catalogue a large number of optical and radar observations",
    "are routinely performed by the united states space surveillance network . nowadays",
    "also europe has launched its space situational awareness ( ssa ) initiative aimed to increase the knowledge of the circumterrestrial environment . in this context",
    "the availability of efficient methods and algorithms for accurate orbit determination is extremely important",
    ".    given two or more sets of observations , the main problem is how to identify which separate sets of data belong to the same physical object ( the so - called _ correlation _ problem ) .",
    "thus the orbit determination problem needs to be solved in two stages : first different sets of observations need to be correlated , then an orbit can be determined ; this combined procedure is called _ linkage _ in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe two different linkage methods , for both optical and radar data . by using the attributable vector ( sec .",
    "[ sec : att ] ) we summarize the information contained in either optical or radar data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ad_reg ] we describe the admissible region and the virtual debris algorithm @xcite and we propose a general scheme to classify observed objects . sec .",
    "[ sec : kepint ] deals with the keplerian integrals method , first introduced by @xcite for the problem of asteroid orbit determination .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of the effect due to the non - spherical shape of the earth is discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : correl_confirm ] , a sketch of the general procedure for the full process of correlation of different observations is outlined .",
    "objects in leo are mostly observed by radar while for meos and geos optical sensors are used . in both cases ,",
    "the batches of observations which can be immediately assigned to a single object give us a set of data that can be summarized in an attributable , that is a 4-dimensional vector . to compute a full orbit , formed by 6 parameters , we need to know 2 further quantities .",
    "thus the question is the identification problem , also called correlation in the debris context : given 2 attributables at different times , can they belong to the same orbiting object ? and if this is the case , can we find an orbit fitting both data sets ?",
    "let @xmath1 be spherical coordinates for the topocentric position of an earth satellite .",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath2 are defined by a topocentric reference system that can be arbitrarily selected . usually , in the applications , @xmath3 is the right ascension and @xmath4 the declination with respect to an equatorial reference system ( e.g. , j2000 ) .",
    "the values of range @xmath5 and range rate @xmath6 are not measured .",
    "we shall call * optical attributable * a vector @xmath7 representing the angular position and velocity of the body at a time @xmath8 in the selected reference frame .    active artificial satellites and space debris",
    "can also be observed by radar : because of the @xmath9 dependence of the signal to noise for radar observations , range and range - rate are currently measured only for debris in leo .",
    "when a return signal is acquired , the antenna pointing angles are also available . given the capability of modern radars to scan very rapidly the entire visible sky , radar can be used to discover all the debris above a minimum size while they are visible from an antenna , or a system of antennas .",
    "when a radar observation is performed we assume that the measured quantities ( all with their own uncertainty ) are the range , the range rate , and also the antenna pointing direction , that is the debris apparent position on the celestial sphere , expressed by two angular coordinates such as right ascension @xmath3 and declination @xmath4 . the time derivatives of these angular coordinates , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are not measured .",
    "we define * radar attributable * a vector @xmath12 containing the information from a radar observation , at the receive time @xmath8 .    to define an orbit given the attributable @xmath13 we need to find the values of two unknowns quantities ( e.g. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the optical case , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the radar case ) , that , together with the attributable , give us a set of * attributable orbital elements * : @xmath14\\ ] ] at a time @xmath15 , computed from @xmath8 taking into account the light - time correction : @xmath16 .",
    "the cartesian geocentric position and velocity @xmath17 can be obtained , given the observer geocentric position @xmath18 at time @xmath8 , by using the unit vector @xmath19 in the direction of the observation : @xmath20 @xmath21",
    "starting from an attributable , we would like to extract sufficient information from it in order to compute preliminary orbits : we shall use the admissible region tool , as described in @xcite . for easy of reading we recall here the basic steps of the theory .",
    "the admissible region replaces the conventional confidence region as defined in the classical orbit determination procedure .",
    "the main requirement is that the geocentric energy of the object is negative , that is the object is a satellite of the earth .      given the geocentric position @xmath22 of the debris , the geocentric position @xmath18 of the observer , and the topocentric position @xmath23 of the debris we have @xmath24 .",
    "the energy ( per unit of mass ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the earth gravitational parameter .",
    "then a definition of admissible region such that only satellites of the earth are allowed includes the condition @xmath27 that could be rewritten as @xmath28 @xmath29 and coefficients @xmath30 depending on the attributable @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the _",
    "proper motion_. in order to obtain real solutions for @xmath6 the discriminant of @xmath33 ( polynomial of degree 2 in @xmath6 ) must be non - negative : @xmath34 this observation results in the following condition on @xmath5 : @xmath35 condition ( [ disc_condition ] ) can be seen as an inequality involving a polynomial @xmath36 of degree 6 : @xmath37 studying the polynomial @xmath36 and its roots , as done by @xcite , the conclusion is that the region of @xmath38 such that condition ( [ negative_energy ] ) is satisfied can admit more than one connected component , but it has at most two . in any case , in a large number of numerical experiments with objects in earth orbit , we have not found examples with two connected components .",
    "the admissible region needs to be compact in order to have the possibility to sample it with a finite number of points , thus a condition defining an inner boundary needs to be added .",
    "the choice for the inner boundary depends upon the specific orbit determination task : a simple method is to add constraints @xmath39 allowing , e.g. , to focus the search of identifications to one of the three classes leo , meo and geo .",
    "another natural choice for the inner boundary is to take @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the thickness of a portion of the earth atmosphere in which a satellite can not remain in orbit for a significant time span . as an alternative ,",
    "it is possible to constrain the semimajor axis to be larger than @xmath42 , and this leads to the inequality @xmath43 which defines another degree six inequality with the same coefficients but for a different constant term .",
    "the qualitative structure of the admissible region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : adregion_optical1 ] .",
    "another possible way to find an inner boundary is to exclude trajectories impacting the earth in less than one revolution , that is to use an inequality on the perigee @xmath44 , already proposed in @xcite : @xmath45 note that this condition naturally implies ( [ e_min ] ) and @xmath46 . to analytically develop the inequality ( [ pericenter1 ] ) we use the 2-body formulae involving the angular momentum : @xmath47 @xmath48 and substituting in ( [ pericenter1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath49 since the left hand side is @xmath50 , we need to impose @xmath51 : this is again @xmath52 . by squaring ( [ pericenter2 ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath53 the above condition is an algebraic inequality in the variables @xmath38 : @xmath54 @xmath55 the coefficient of @xmath56 is positive , thus to obtain real solutions for @xmath6 the discriminant of ( [ pericenter3 ] ) must be non negative : @xmath57 this condition is equivalent to the following : @xmath58 note that the inequality ( [ ineq_peri ] ) is similar to ( [ disc_condition ] ) . however , in this case , the function in the right hand side is much more complicated , and there is no easy way to use the condition ( [ pericenter1 ] ) to explicitly describe the boundary of the admissible region ; e.g. , we do not have a rigorous bound on the number of connected components .",
    "this condition ( [ pericenter1 ] ) will be used only _ a posteriori _ as a filter ( sec .",
    "[ sec : vda ] ) .",
    "[ fig : adregion_optical2 ] shows also this inner boundary ; note that the boundaries of the regions defined by ( [ e_min ] ) and by @xmath40 are also plotted in the figure , but these constraints are not necessary .",
    "we have also plotted an alternative outer boundary constraining the apocenter @xmath59 at some large value @xmath60 : @xmath61 this outer boundary can be used in the same way , as an _ a posteriori _ filter .      given a radar attributable @xmath62 ,",
    "we define as radar admissible region for a space debris the set of values of @xmath63 such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 depend on the attributable @xcite : @xmath66 the boundary of the admissible region is then given by @xmath67 and this equation represents an ellipse with its axes aligned with the coordinate axes in the @xmath63 plane . actually , in a plane @xmath68 , with the axes rescaled according to the metric of the tangent plane to the celestial sphere , the curves @xmath69 are circles .",
    "the region defined by negative geocentric energy , the inside of a circle , is a compact set , and the problem of defining an inner boundary is much less important than in the optical attributable case .",
    "anyway , it is possible to define an inner boundary by constraining the semimajor axis @xmath70 , that is by eq .",
    "( [ e_min ] ) , resulting in a concentric inner circle , thus in an admissible region forming a circular annulus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adregion_radar1 ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to exclude the ballistic trajectories by imposing the condition ( [ pericenter1 ] ) in which @xmath71 are to be considered as variables .",
    "the angular momentum is given by @xmath72 @xmath73 the condition on the pericenter is expressed by a polynomial inequality of degree 2 : @xmath74 @xmath75    thus the admissible region can be geometrically described as a region bounded by three conics : the first two are concentric circles , the third one can be either an ellipse or an hyperbola ( depending on the sign of @xmath76 ) , with a different center and different symmetry axes .",
    "[ fig : aregion_radar_2 ] and [ fig : aregion_radar_3 ] show the possible qualitatively different cases .",
    "the admissible region can be used to generate a swarm of virtual debris : we sample it using the delaunay triangulation @xcite for the optical case and the cobweb @xcite for the radar case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triang ] and [ fig : cobweb ] .",
    "the condition on the pericenter is not used at this step , because we could lose some important geometrical properties : this condition is used as filter , the nodes with a low pericenter are discarded .    the idea is to generate a swarm of virtual debris @xmath77 , corresponding to the nodes of the admissible region of one of the two attributables , let us say @xmath78",
    ". then we compute , from each of the @xmath77 , a prediction @xmath79 for the epoch @xmath80 , each with its covariance matrix @xmath81 .",
    "thus for each virtual debris @xmath77 we can compute an attribution penalty @xmath82 @xcite and use the values as a criterion to select some of the virtual debris to proceed to the orbit computation .",
    "thus the procedure is as follows : we select some maximum value @xmath83 for the attribution penalty and if there are some nodes such that @xmath84 we proceed to the correlation confirmation .",
    "if this is not the case , we can try with another method , such as the one described in sec .",

    "other more exotic populations , which are very unlikely , also have their region in the half plane : e.g. , there are regions for direct departure / arrival to the earth from interstellar space , which we have labeled as et trajectories",
    ".    the same `` universal '' figure can be generated from a given radar attributable ( fig  [ fig : aregion_univ_radar ] ) . in this case",

    "we shall describe a method proposed for the asteroid case in @xcite and based on the two - body integrals , to produce preliminary orbits starting from two attributables @xmath78 , @xmath91 of the same object at two epochs @xmath92 , @xmath80 .",
    "we assume that the orbit between @xmath92 and @xmath80 is well approximated by a keplerian 2-body orbit , with constant energy @xmath93 and angular momentum vector @xmath94 : @xmath95      using ( [ angmom_opt ] ) and by scalar product between with the first equation of ( [ keplerian_system ] ) and @xmath96 we obtain the scalar equation of degree 2 : @xmath97 geometrically , this equation defines a conic section in the @xmath98 plane . by the formulae giving @xmath99 , @xmath100 as a function of @xmath101 , @xmath102 derived from the angular momentum equations : @xmath103 the energies @xmath104 , @xmath105 can be considered as functions of @xmath101 , @xmath102 only",
    ". thus we obtain : @xmath106 a system of 2 equations in 2 unknowns , already present in @xcite : they proposed a newton - raphson method to solve the system , but this results into a loss of control on the number of alternate solutions . in @xcite",
    "the authors have applied the same equations to the asteroid problem , and proposed a different approach to the solution of the system .",
    "the energy equation is algebraic , but not polynomial , because there are denominators containing square roots . by squaring",
    "twice it is possible to obtain a polynomial equation @xmath107 : the degree of this equation is 24 .",
    "thus the system @xmath108 has exactly 48 solutions in the complex domain , counting them with multiplicity .",
    "of course we are interested only in solutions with @xmath101 , @xmath102 real and positive , moreover the squaring of the equations introduces spurious solutions .",
    "nevertheless , we have found examples with up to 11 non spurious solutions .",
    "we need a global solution of the algebraic system of overall degree 48 , providing at once all the possible couples @xmath98 .",
    "this is a classical problem of algebraic geometry , which can be solved with the resultant method : we can build an auxiliary sylvester matrix , in this case @xmath109 , with coefficients polynomials in @xmath102 , and its determinant , the resultant , is a polynomial of degree 48 in @xmath102 only .",
    "the values of @xmath102 appearing in the solutions of the polynomial system are the roots of the resultant @xcite .",
    "the computation of the resultant is numerically unstable , because the coefficients have a wide range of orders of magnitude : we have to use quadruple precision",
    ". once the resultant is available , there are methods to solve the univariate polynomial equations , providing at once all the complex roots with rigorous error bounds @xcite . given all the roots which could be real , we solve for the other variable @xmath101 , select the positive couples @xmath98 and remove the spurious ones due to squaring .",
    "if the number of remaining solutions is 0 , the attributables can not be correlated with this method .",
    "the formulae for geocentric energy and angular momentum are given by ( [ energy_rad ] ) and ( [ angmom_rad ] ) , polynomials of degree 2 and 1 in the unknowns @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the system ( [ keplerian_system ] ) has overall algebraic degree 2 : such a system can be solved by elementary algebra .",
    "the angular momentum equations are @xmath110 that is a system of 3 linear equations in 4 unknowns @xmath111 and can be solved for three unknowns as a function of one of the four .",
    "for example , by scalar product between ( [ angmom_eq_rad ] ) and @xmath112 we have @xmath113 and in a similar way we obtain @xmath114    when the equations for , say , @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 are substituted in the equation for the energies @xmath117 we obtain a quadratic equation in @xmath116 , which can be solved by elementary algebra , giving at most two real solutions .",
    "geometrically , equation ( [ angmom_eq_rad ] ) can be described by a straight line in a plane , e.g. , in @xmath118 , where the energy equation defines a conic section .",
    "there are some cases in which the keplerian integrals method can not be applied .    in the optical case",
    "we have to avoid the condition @xmath119 .",
    "this can happen when :    * @xmath120 is parallel to @xmath121 , i.e. the observation at time @xmath92 is done at the observer zenith ; * @xmath122 is parallel to @xmath123 , i.e. , the observation at time @xmath80 is done at the observer zenith ; * @xmath120 , @xmath122 , @xmath121 and @xmath123 are coplanar .",
    "this case arises whenever a geostationary object is observed from the same station at the same hour of distinct nights .",
    "as it is normal , the mathematical singularity is surrounded by a neighborhood in which the method is possible for zero error ( both zero observational error and zero rounding off in the computation ) , but is not applicable in practice .",
    "e.g. , for nearly geosynchronous orbits , even if they are not geostationary , and for hours of observations in different nights different by few minutes , this method fails .    in the radar case",
    "the procedure fails only if the four vectors @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 do not generate a linear space of dimension 3 , i.e. , when : @xmath128 for @xmath129 we obtain @xmath130[\\mathbf r_1\\cdot(\\hat{\\bm\\rho}_{\\alpha      1}\\times\\hat{\\bm\\rho}_{\\delta 1})]=0\\\\    \\rho_1 ^ 2\\rho_2[\\hat{\\bm\\rho}_{\\alpha 2}\\cdot(\\mathbf    r_1\\times\\mathbf r_2)][\\mathbf r_1\\cdot(\\hat{\\bm\\rho}_{\\delta      1}\\times\\hat{\\bm\\rho}_{\\alpha 1})]=0 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and for @xmath131 the formulae are analogous . thus there is singularity when :    * @xmath132 is parallel to @xmath133 ; * @xmath134 , but this can never happen , apart from coordinate singularities , because @xmath135 ; * @xmath136 and @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 belong to the orbital plane .      once a solution of ( [ keplerian_system ] ) is computed the values of attributable elements can be obtained for the epochs @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and they can be converted into the usual keplerian elements : @xmath143 where @xmath144 are the mean anomalies .",
    "the first four keplerian elements @xmath145 are functions of the 2-body energy and angular momentum vectors @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and are the same for @xmath148 .",
    "thus the result can be assembled in the 8-dimensional vector : @xmath149 there are compatibility conditions between @xmath150 and @xmath151 to be satisfied if the two attributables belong to the same object : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the mean motion .",
    "we can not demand the exact equality in the formulae above , because of various error sources , including the uncertainty of the attributable , and the changes on the keplerian integrals due to the perturbations with respect to the 2-body model .",
    "thus we need a metric to measure in an objective way the residuals in the compatibility conditions .",
    "the two attributables @xmath154 used to compute the coefficients of equations ( [ keplerian_system ] ) have been computed from the observations by using a least squares fit to the individual observations , thus @xmath155 covariance matrices @xmath156 and @xmath157 are available ; they can be used to form the block diagonal @xmath158 covariance matrix for both attributables @xmath159 .",
    "the keplerian integral method allows to compute explicitly the vector @xmath160 of ( [ vector8 ] ) and , by means of the implicit function theorem , its partial derivatives , thus it is possible by the standard covariance propagation formula @xcite[sec .",

    "the multiple orbits obtained from the solutions of the algebraic problem are just preliminary orbits , solution of a 2-body approximation ( as in the classical methods of laplace and gauss ) , or possibly of a @xmath0-only problem .",
    "they have to be replaced by least squares orbits , with a dynamical model including all the relevant perturbations .    even after confirmation by least squares",
    "fit , it might still be the case that some linkages with just two attributables can be _ false _ , that is the two attributables might belong to different objects .",
    "this is confirmed by the tests with real data reported in @xcite for the virtual debris method and in @xcite for the keplerian integrals method .",
    "@xcite have found the same phenomenon in a simulation of the application of the same algorithm to the asteroid case .",
    "thus every linkage of two attributables needs to be confirmed by correlating a third attributable .",
    "the process of looking for a third attributable which can also be correlated to the other two is called attribution @xcite . from the available 2-attributable orbit with covariance",
    "we predict the attributable @xmath218 at the time @xmath219 of the third attributable , and compare with @xmath220 computed from the third set of observations .",
    "both @xmath218 and @xmath220 come with a covariance matrix , we can compute the @xmath168 of the difference and use it as a test .",
    "for the attributions passing this test we proceed to the differential corrections .",
    "the procedure is recursive , that is we can use the 3-attributable orbit to search for attribution of a fourth attributable , and so on .",
    "this generates a very large number of many - attributable orbits , but there are many duplications , corresponding to adding them in a different order .    by correlation management we mean a procedure to remove duplicates ( e.g. , @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) and inferior correlations ( e.g. , @xmath221 is superior to both @xmath223 and to @xmath224 , thus both are removed ) .",
    "the output catalog after this process is called normalized . in the process",
    ", we may try to merge two correlations with some attributables in common , by computing a common orbit @xcite .",
    "we have described two algorithms to solve the linkage problem , that is to compute an orbit for an earth - orbiting object observed in two well separated arcs .",
    "the first method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible region of negative geocentric energy orbits , which is sampled to generate virtual orbits .",
    "the latter are propagated in time to find other observations which could belong to the same object .",
    "the second method exploits the integrals of the 2-body problem , which are constant even over a significant time span and thus should apply to both observed arcs of the same object .",
    "this top level description is enough to understand that the virtual debris algorithm should be applied to short time intervals between observed arcs , less than one orbital period or at most a few orbital periods .",
    "the keplerian integrals method can be used for longer time spans , spanning several orbital periods ; it is near to a singularity for very short time spans and in some other near - resonance conditions , such as observations of a geosynchronous orbits at the same hour in different nights .",
    "we conclude that each method should be used in the cases in which it is most suitable .",
    "both algorithms have been tested for the optical case with real data from the esa optical ground station @xcite with good results .",
    "the analogous algorithms have been tested for asteroids in simulations of next generation surveys @xcite .",
    "future work should include the tests of the radar case and the solution of other related problem , like _ orbit identification _ between two objects for which an orbit is already available .",

    "<S> we propose two algorithms to provide a full preliminary orbit of an earth - orbiting object with a number of observations lower than the classical methods , such as those by laplace and gauss . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the virtual debris algorithm , based upon the admissible region , that is the set of the unknown quantities corresponding to possible orbits for objects in earth orbit ( as opposed to both interplanetary orbits and ballistic ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar method has already been successfully used in recent years for the asteroidal case . </S>",
    "<S> the second algorithm uses the integrals of the geocentric 2-body motion , which must have the same values at the times of the different observations for a common orbit to exist . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how to account for the perturbations of the 2-body motion , e.g. , the @xmath0 effect . </S>"
