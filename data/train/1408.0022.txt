    "afterwards , we apply perturbative cuts ( pcuts ) to derive high - order series expansions for the vbs phase of the effective spin model .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath65 are @xmath66 for @xmath61do states and @xmath67 for states with dos .",
    "as @xmath68=0 $ ] , the effective hamiltonian consists of a decoupled block without dos , i.e.  spin and charge degrees of freedom have been separated .",
    "this allows us to derive an effective spin model as we will detail below .",
    "we stress that our choice for @xmath65 is different from the usual choice which identifies @xmath65 with the number operator of dos @xcite .",
    "although in both cases one is able to derive an effective spin model , our definition of @xmath65 has numerical advantages , since the corresponding cut has to uncouple less operators .",
    "the commutator in the flow equation leads typically to an infinite number of terms , so that a truncation must be performed .",
    "the truncation scheme used in gcuts @xcite is to solve the flow equation on topologically distinct finite clusters , called graphs . on these graphs",
    "the hamiltonian has a representation in terms of a finite matrix .",
    "consequently , the flow equation has to converge and can be solved numerically exact .",
    "afterwards , one subtracts all subgraph contributions from a given graph .",
    "these reduced contributions of each graph are embedded on the infinite lattice to get a result in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the number of possible embeddings is called embedding factor .",
    "the numerical effort of the gcut depends essentially on the graph size as well as on the total number of graphs , since both grow exponentially with the number of sites .",
    "a full graph decomposition of the lattice meets the additional challenges that single graphs can contain less lattice symmetries compared to the full problem and the embedding factors might become very large demanding a very high numerical precision .",
    "therefore , we decided not to perform a full graph decomposition , but to expand in terms of rectangular graphs @xcite which keeps the number of graphs and the embedding factors smaller ( see ref .   for a similar approach on the honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "here we calculated all contributions from the topological distinct graphs @xmath69 up to three plaquettes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allgraphs ] having up to @xmath70 hubbard sites .",

    "the index @xmath72 classifies the graphs by the number of hubbard sites which are then further counted by @xmath74 .",
    "red filled circles denote hubbard sites which are connected via hopping amplitudes @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) by black ( cyan ) lines . ]      in principle one has to create all possible hubbard states on a particular graph and solve the graph - dependent cut .",
    "but in order to efficiently solve the flow equations one should keep the size of the matrix as small as possible , since the total number of flow equations of @xmath69 increases quickly as @xmath75 .",
    "this can be achieved by implementing symmetries . in refs .",
    "the only symmetry taken into account is the conservation of @xmath76 .",
    "here we go beyond this scheme :    first , as acting with the hamiltonoperator on states conserves all symmetries , it is useful i ) to choose the 0do states as initial states and ii ) to act with @xmath77 on these states to create other orthogonal states containing dos using the gram - schmidt algorithm . after each acting with @xmath77 ,",
    "one performs the cut and checks if the 0do block is already converged after the cut .",
    "in contrast to creating all states of a given graph , we observe this approach to converge with already much less states compared to the full hilbert space dimension .",
    "second , we use the _ full _ @xmath0-symmetry of the hubbard model when constructing the 0do states .",
    "this can be achieved by creating all half - filled hubbard states without dos as spin states .",
    "using the @xmath0-symmetry is then only a matter of adding angular momenta through generalized clebsch - gordan - coefficients  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cut on graph @xmath69 is performed for each pair of quantum numbers @xmath78 independently with an optimal basis which allows us to reduce the numerical effort considerably .    for the cut itself the convergence criteria",
    "is defined with respect to the so called residual off - diagonality ( rod ) , which is the sum of squared off - diagonal elements .",
    "all elements which couple the 0do to the @xmath62do - block are squared and summed over .",
    "as soon as the rod reaches a value lower than @xmath79 the cut is stopped .",
    "the quasi - particle generator leads typically to a minimization of the rod , but it can be a problem if the @xmath62do - block contains eigenvalues which lie below the eigenvalues of the 0do - block .",
    "in this situation the quasi - particle generator exchanges the corresponding levels which implies that a separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom is not straightforward on the corresponding graph .",
    "it is then reasonable to abort the cut if the rod has reached a minimal value , since the exchange of levels during the flow is typically accompanied with a temporarilly increasing rod .",
    "this strategy breaks down if the remaining rod is still sizable which occurs for the current problem at large values of @xmath20 as detailed below .",
    "the basis is generated by successively acting with the hamiltonian on all 0do states .",
    "this is performed until the difference in the 0do - block is below @xmath80 .",
    "for example , on @xmath81 at @xmath3 and @xmath82 , the number of spin states and the number of required states for convergence of the 0do - block is shown in tab .",

    "on one side we have used the pinning field approach @xcite to compute the magnetic moment . as argued in ref .  , since this approach breaks the spin symmetry , very large values of the projection parameter are required to guarantee convergence to the ground state .",
    "the pinning field simulations presented here are carried out at @xmath176 . for simulations where @xmath0-spin symmetry is present",
    ", values of @xmath177 suffice for convergence .",
    "let us note that the computational cost grows linearly with @xmath178 such that reaching large projection parameters is not prohibitively expensive .",
    "the qmc approach is at best suited to study the phase diagram starting from weak coupling . in contrast",
    ", the cut excels in the strong coupling such that a combination of both methods has the potential of elucidating the nature of the phase diagram .",
    "here we focus first on the values @xmath179 giving representative results for the qualitatively different sequences of phases as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "afterwards , we study the breakdown of the vbs for continuously varying @xmath123 .",
    "the case @xmath2 corresponds to the @xmath13-flux square lattice . in the following we show by qmc that one finds a direct transition between the sm and a long - range ordered nel state which is similar to the case @xmath38 where the model reduces to the hubbard model on the isotropic honeycomb lattice .",
    "compelling results @xcite on lattices up to @xmath180 unit cells as well as pinning field results of ref .",
    "point to a direct transition between the semi - metallic phase and antiferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the phase transition can be understood in terms of gross neveu criticality .",
    "simulations at @xmath181 are facilitated by the c@xmath40 symmetry of the underlying triangular lattice , such that the dirac cones present at weak coupling are pinned to interaction independent momenta .",
    "finite values of @xmath19 break this symmetry and the cones can meander .",
    "for example in the absence of interactions , the cones will meet and annihilate at the @xmath43-point at @xmath110 ( see also sect .",
    "[ ssec : free ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the point @xmath182 also possesses an enhanced symmetry .",
    "this c@xmath41 symmetry becomes apparent when taking an adequate gauge choice setting all hopping matrix elements of the square lattice to @xmath183 and moving say clockwise around a plaquette . as a consequence ,",
    "dirac cones are pinned to wave vectors @xmath184 .",
    "knowing where the nodes are located greatly simplifies the numerical calculations by qmc since it allows us to choose a set of lattice sizes where they are present .",
    "this set of lattice sizes generically yield a smooth scaling to the thermodynamic limit .     as a function of @xmath185 at @xmath182 . here",
    "we have use a projection parameter @xmath176 .",

    "in contrast to the @xmath13-flux square lattice , the vbs is realized in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we therefore deduce the phase diagram by qmc and cuts yielding the presence of a nel - ordered intermediate phase between sm and vbs .    at @xmath210",
    ", there is no symmetry which pins the dirac points to specific values of the momenta such that a precise calculation of the single - particle gap with qmc is hard . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to start from strong coupling .",
    "the vbs state is characterized by a finite spin gap to triplon excitations , which we can determine either with qmc in a very similar way as the single - particle gap or by the cut approach yielding the one - triplon gap as a high - order series expansion in magnetic exchange couplings linked to the original hubbard model by our gcut approach .    with qmc",
    ", we measure the imaginary time displaced spin - spin correlation function at the anti - ferrromagnetic wave vector and fit the tail of the qmc data to the form @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the energy difference between the and ground - state energies .",

    "there are two possible mean - field like scenarios which can account for the instability of the dirac semi - metal to the vbs state .",
    "since there is no symmetry reason to pin the momenta of the dirac points , they can meander as a function of the interaction strength , and meet at the @xmath43-point at @xmath214 .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the absence of interactions at @xmath110 ( see also sect .",
    "[ ssec : free ] ) .",
    "note that within this picture , the density of states at the critical point is given by @xmath215 . at the rpa level , this does not lead to a weak coupling magnetic instability .",
    "the second possibility is that there is an ordered phase separating the weak coupling dirac semi - metal from the vbs .",
    "our numerical qmc results as well as the fact that the vbs breaks down by triplon condensation support this point of view .",
    "we have computed the real space spin - spin correlations and extracted the local moment : @xmath216 fig .",
    "[ fig : spineq_x_tm2 ] plots the above quantity ar @xmath217 on an @xmath218 lattice .",
    "we choose the x - direction since the dimerization being along the y - axis we expect dominant spin - spin correlations along the former axis . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : spineq_x_tm2 ] no order is detectable in the vbs phase for @xmath219 . below the vbs phase , at @xmath220 for instant , the data supports long range magnetic ordering which gives way to a paramagnetic phase below @xmath221 .",
    "thus , at @xmath222 the qmc data supports the following picture .",
    "first , the dirac semi - metal develops a mass gap due to the onset of anti - ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "this transition is expected to be in the gross - neveu universality class . at a slightly larger value of @xmath1",
    "this magnetically ordered phase gives way to the vbs .",
    "this transition does not involve fermonic degrees of freedom and is expected to belong to the o(3 ) universality class .",
    "the latter scenario is in full agreement with our cut approach .",
    "first , the quantum phase transition between vbs and nel order is located at @xmath219 , where we observe that our effective spin model nicely converges , i.e.  fermionic degrees of freedom can be well separated from magnetic degrees of freedom in this parameter regime .",
    "second , the cut approach detects the breakdown of the vbs at very similar values of @xmath1 by investigating the one - triplon gap with a momentum consistent with nel order .",
    "furthermore , also the critical exponent @xmath164 of the one - triplon gap is consistent with the expected o(3 ) universality class as we elaborate on in the next section .",
    "next we study the breakdown of the vbs by triplon condensation for general values of @xmath123 by analysing the one - triplon gap deduced from the cut approach .",
    "the corresponding values from extrapolating the one - triplon gap with dlogpad extrapolation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "let us start with the strong - coupling limit @xmath213 . here",
    "the gcut part is expected to be fully converged and the effective spin hamiltonian essentially reduces to the @xmath51-@xmath52-model with @xmath223 ( see sect .",
    "[ ssec : strong_coupling ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , this does not imply that analysing the series has to be simple , but in our case it works rather well although the obtained perturbative order is moderate .",
    "we find a critical point at @xmath224 in good agreememt with qmc simulations of the ( unfrustrated ) @xmath51-@xmath52-model @xcite . at the same time",
    "the critical exponent @xmath164 is found to be @xmath225 which is only slightly larger than the expected one from the o(3 ) universality class being @xmath226 .",
    "note that this overshooting behaviour is rather typical for high - order series expansions .",
    "the results for @xmath3 from qmc and cuts suggest that the breakdown of the vbs does always correspond to a softening of the one - triplon mode and a quantum phase transition inside the mott insulator to a nel - ordered state is expected .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the associated critical line and check whether the critical exponent remains constant when varying @xmath123 .",
    "interestingly , this is not case .",
    "we observe that the critical exponent monotonically shrinks from @xmath227 at @xmath228 down to almost zero when reducing to @xmath110 .",
    "clearly , this unphysical behaviour should be attributed to uncertainties in the cut approach , mostly from the first step using gcut to separate spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , for @xmath229 , the expected quantum phase transition between vbs and nel order takes place at large values of @xmath230 where a separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom becomes challenging .",
    "we are therefore convinced that the current implementation of the gcut breaks down for @xmath230 and one should not trust the results in this regime .",
    "likely , the same effect is present already for @xmath231 yielding still good estimates for the critical point but giving uncertainties in the more sensitive critical exponent .",
    "one can therefore track the one - triplon gap of the vbs quantitatively in a wide parameter regime inside the vbs phase , but quantum critical points are only well described for @xmath232 .",
    "we used qmc and cuts to study the half - filled hubbard model on a one - parameter family of vortex - full square lattices ranging from the isotropic case to weakly coupled hubbard dimers .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram consists of a sm , a bi , a magnetically ordered nel phase and a vbs .",
    "the breakdown of the sm is typically to an ordered nel phase even in parameter regimes where a vbs phase is present at strong coupling .",
    "the cut approach is done in a two - step process combining for the first time gcuts and pcuts .",
    "the gcut is applied to separate spin and charge degrees of freedom non - perturbatively yielding an effective low - energy spin model for the mott insulating phase .",
    "this becomes problematic if degrees of freedom start to overlap on the considered graphs which we indeed observe for the largest graphs and/or large values of @xmath123 .",
    "it would be very fascinating ( but challenging ) to improve the generator of the cut on the graphs in order to disentangle spin and charge states in parameter regimes where the lowest energy levels on graphs are still well described by spin states . in a second step",
    ", we derived high - order series expansions for the one - triplon gap inside the vbs phase by pcuts . to this end the effective spin model is reduced to all couplings which fit on a single plaquette , i.e.  it contains two - spin and four - spin interactions .",
    "interestingly , even in the parameter regime where the effective model seems to be well converged , our results indicate that a proper calculation of critical exponents is very challenging .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that other magnetic couplings like six - spin interactions on double plaquettes ( or others ) become important in this @xmath20 regime .",
    "physically , our results for the @xmath13-flux square lattice are in disagreement with ref .",
    ", since we do not find an intermediate spin - liquid phase but a direct transition between semi - metal and a nel - ordered phase .",
    "similar to the recent findings for the hubbard model on the isotropic honeycomb lattice which result from numerical advancements @xcite , also our findings for the @xmath13-flux square lattices benefits from optimizations in the qmc simulations .",
    "overall our results further support that mott transitions of dirac fermions are generically described by gross - neveu criticality where the mass gap is generated by symmetry breaking fields .",
