    "recently a significant amount of research is going on to ensure secure communication in wireless networks . due to broadcast nature of wireless transmission ,",
    "the transmitted messages can be intercepted by eavesdroppers . though cryptographic security can be used to counteract eavesdropping , but secrecy measure of such scheme relies on the computational complexity of cryptographic functions rather than information theoretic principles .",
    "also , distributing secret key across the network has its own overhead . on contrary",
    ", physical layer security schemes exploit the inherent randomness present in the wireless channel and provide information theoretically provable secure communication irrespective of the computational capability of the eavesdropper(s ) .",
    "physical layer security came to existence when wyner in a seminal paper @xcite showed that a non - zero secrecy rate is possible for a discrete memoryless channel if the eavesdropper s channel is degraded .",
    "following his work researchers have evaluated secrecy capacity and equivocation region of single antenna and multi - antenna systems .",
    "however , resource constrained multi - hop networks have not got enough attention though they are practically significant .    in a multihop wireless network ,",
    "intermediate relay nodes have to follow certain relaying strategy for forwarding packets to the next relay or destination .",
    "amplify and forward relaying scheme is simplest among them where each node transmits the message it has received after amplification ( scaling ) . though simplest in nature but the significance of this scheme lies in its low cost implementation and effectiveness against fading . nevertheless , from theoretical point of view study of such a relaying scheme",
    "can help us to estimate lower bounds of the channel capacity of other communication scenarios ( e.g. analog network coding ) .",
    "very recently , researchers have started investigating the significance of amplify and forward relaying for attaining physical layer security @xcite .",
    "in our paper we consider a scenario where relay nodes uses amplify and forward relaying to convey the source message to the destination .",
    "however , due to the presence of one or more eavesdropper secrecy of communication is in jeopardy .",
    "for such a scenario secrecy rate of the network provide a good measure of performance of the system . unlike some previous works where only total relay power constraints is assumed , we consider the individual relay power constraint also . in practice",
    "the relay nodes are generally powered by their individual power source without any means to share their power sources ( e.g. battery ) .",
    "therefore , individual relay constraint is more relevant in practical situations and general . assuming the availability of global channel state information ( csi )",
    ", we consider a two hop network consists of a single source , a single destination and multiple relay nodes .",
    "as each of the relay node connects the source and destination separately , they form a diamond like structure and hence named accordingly .",
    "we begin our analysis with a symmetric diamond network and provide the analytical solution for optimal scaling factor of relay nodes .",
    "we then relax the symmetric network assumption and analyze the scenario where eavesdropper s channel vector is scaled version of receiver s channel . for general case",
    "where multiple eavesdroppers are involved we have multiple secrecy rate corresponding to each eavesdropper and the objective would be to maximize the minimum of them over the same constraint set . in our paper , we provide a sub - optimal solution for individual relay constraints , whereas we propose an iterative algorithm for secrecy rate in case of sum constraint and individual constraint .",
    "we summarize our contribution as follows :    * for symmetric diamond network we provide analytical solution for secrecy rate .",
    "* we discuss and analyze a step - by - step procedure for calculating optimal secrecy rate when eavesdropper s channel vector is scaled version of receiver s channel . * for general case",
    "we discuss the sub - optimal  zero - forcing \" solution for individual relay constraint .",
    "there we reformulate the optimization problem as a quadratic program which can be solved efficiently .",
    "* we propose an iterative algorithm for obtaining optimal secrecy rate for sum relay and individual constraint scenarios .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : rel ] , we survey the related work . the system model and notations",
    "are introduced in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "secrate ] , we analyze the secrecy rate for several channel conditions of receiver and eavesdropper . we illustrate numerical results of the formulations in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "we conclude our paper in section [ sec : concl ] with a brief summary and possible future work .",
    "amplify and forward scheme was introduced by schein and gallager @xcite and was considered as a mean of cooperative communication by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later several researchers have reported that cooperative scheme like amplify and forward not only provides robustness against channel variations but also ensures non - zero secrecy rate in certain scenarios where otherwise it is zero .",
    "for example , if the source to destination channel is poor as compared to source to eavesdropper channel , then by using appropriate scaling factor in relay nodes we can cancel out the received signal at eavesdropper and thereby improve the secrecy rate .",
    "as we have assumed gaussian channel model it is worth mentioning that the secrecy capacity for gaussian wiretap channel was evaluated by cheong and hellman @xcite .",
    "later the effect of fading on gaussian wiretap channel model was analysed by @xcite and @xcite . the wire - tap model in context of multi - antenna system was considered and analysed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "but both the single and multi - antenna system were limited to single - hop network .",
    "as the multi - hop wireless networks are equally significant , so recently research in this area has got a good pace .",
    "lai and gamal @xcite evaluated the secrecy capacity of relay - eavesdropper channel for different cooperative schemes and also evaluated corresponding equivocation region .",
    "authors in @xcite reported the improvement in physical layer security with the help of cooperating relays .",
    "same authors later elaborated the significance of amplify and forward scheme for attaining physical layer security in @xcite .",
    "but in their work they considered total relay constraint criteria and provided bounding results for secrecy capacity . for multiple eavesdroppers scenario they suggested the  zero - forcing solution \" where by beam - forming the transmitted signal",
    "is nullified at each eavesdropper .",
    "the more practical individual relay constraint criteria was considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the authors of the both the papers provided an iterative algorithm for calculating the optimal amplification vector for relay nodes for maximizing secrecy rate using semi - definite relaxation .",
    "our work discusses the special cases of the model considered in @xcite and investigate the nature of the solution for those special cases .",
    "our approach significantly differs from the techniques used in @xcite and @xcite as we have converted our problem into a convex optimization problem by using a noble transformation of variables .",
    "further we discuss the convergence of the solution to the global optimum .",
    "infact we identify that for certain special cases we can evaluate the optimal scaling factor analytically . those analytical results are motivated from @xcite and @xcite , where authors have devised schemes to find the optimal amplification vector for attaining the capacity of amplify and forward network under individual relay constraints in absence of secrecy criteria .",

    "figure [ fig_secvsrelays ] depicts variation of secrecy with respect to number of relay nodes deployed . as the number of relay node increases new paths from source to destinations are available and therefore , by choosing proper scaling factor we can achieve better secrecy rate .",
    "this applies for all three schemes ( zero forcing , individual constraint and sum constraint ) and is also evident from the plot .",
    "we have calculated the optimal scaling vector for two - hop amplify and forward ( af ) to obtain the optimum secrecy rate in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers .",
    "we begin with considering the special channel conditions for the diamond network and gradually moved to general scenario .",
    "analytical solution for special channel conditions and numerical solution for general scenario is proposed . in future",
    "we would like to investigate optimum secrecy rate of a general af network .",
    "also , as friendly jamming improves the secrecy rate in several scenarios , we would like to investigate the impact of jamming on secrecy rate in af networks .",
