    "for some decades the paradigm of network was represented by the random graphs@xcite , which modelled graphs with a huge number of vertices and edges as a stochastic process . in the well - known erds - rnyi model with @xmath0 vertices , the occurrence of an edge , from the @xmath1 possibilities ,",
    "is determined independently with some fixed probability . despite the fact that the introduction of probability concepts in graph theory represented a progress in many areas  even besides mathematics  , it failed to describe many properties of `` real networks '' like internet , air traffic system , social links between people , and so on .",
    "however , the 1990s witnessed many important progress in attempt to examine these `` real networks '' . to cite some of them , the small - world network of watts and strogatz@xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) is a model that can interpolate , by tuning a single parameter , a random graph and a regular lattice .",
    "this model succeeded in characterize an interval for this parameter where the small - world property is displayed .",
    "barabsi and albert , on the other hand , have proposed the growing network with preferential linking@xcite , which succeeded in display the scale - free properties , present in a myriad variety of `` real networks '' .",
    "these models have been intensively analysed , with many progress .",
    "nevertheless , the networks studied by the above authors lied on an abstract space , where the geometric structure on which the vertices are placed is not important .",
    "this picture revealed to be favourable for networks that can be analysed , for instance , by tools from spin glass theory or spin systems with finite connectivity that can be studied with similar techniques@xcite .",
    "many `` real networks '' , however , have an additional feature : they are embedded in some geographic structure , which not only allows one to distinguish `` near '' and `` far '' vertices from some point , but they may determine the dynamics of the evolution of networks .",
    "for instance , many cities grow starting from a `` initial '' region and expand away from this center gradually ; as another example , it is common to see people making friendships with those that live nearer than farther .",
    "this theme  the influence of the geography on networks  has attracted attention , and there are interesting researches being done in the context of computer science@xcite , with recent progress also in the physical literature@xcite .    in the literature , networks on euclidean structures have usually other properties attached together@xcite . for instance , in @xcite ,",
    "a random growing network was considered on a two - dimensional euclidean structure together with preferential linking ; the authors showed , by numerical methods , that the strength of the interaction ( that depends on the euclidean distance between them ) between vertices can change the profile of the degree distribution from a power - law to a stretched exponential ( similar results were found by @xcite ) , and the small - world property is preserved for any strength of this interaction@xcite .",
    "a related problem was studied in @xcite , where the crossover between scale - free and spatial networks was considered .",
    "the authors of @xcite have succeeded in constructing a non - growing geographical small - world network with scale - free distribution .",
    "there are also works that investigated weight properties ( differences in the link `` intensities'')@xcite on models related to the one studied here",
    ".    nevertheless , it is important to be aware of the real importance of the metric structure on the network .",
    "therefore , a graph which has metric properties only is an important model since it concentrates on the influence of geographic structure on the network and leads to a better notion of what the real range of a metric network is .",
    "for instance , scale - free properties is not expected for the model proposed in this work since it is purely metric and no preferential attachment is invoked . searching some general features of a network on a metric structure is the main purpose of this work .",
    "the present work intends to contribute in this direction by introducing a growing network that lies on a space with a metric arrangement , where geographic distances between vertices are present and do influence on graph properties of the system .",
    "the model proposed in this work allows one to define vertices that are `` far '' or `` close '' from a fixed vertex from the standpoint of their geographic arrangement  like what happens with a euclidean space like @xmath2 . to stress the metric structure of the model , a power - law form , with exponent @xmath3 , was chosen to describe the probability that two vertices , separated by a metric distance @xmath4 , are connected ( the probability is proportional to @xmath5 ) . the motivation to choose this particular form is twofold : firstly",
    ", the power - law form can tune , with a single paramenter ( @xmath3 ) , the strength of interaction between vertices ( low values of @xmath3 makes the network close to a random graph , while large values of @xmath3 makes the network close to a regular lattice structure ) . in the literature , the exponential distribution has already been tested by waxman@xcite ( moreover , the random network topology generator of waxman yields a graph that is quite different from the one proposed here , where the distance between vertices are `` carefully '' chosen ) .",
    "moreover , power - law form is interesting since it yielded many non - trivial results to problems that are similar to ones that are discussed in this work@xcite .",
    "the model proposed here is manageable to analytic treatments in some interesting cases , and an analysis of the mean degree is carried out , as well as other graph properties .",
    "the next two sections present the model and fix notations .",
    "the mean degree of the network is analysed in sections iv and v. the aim to discuss this quantity is to show that the model proposed in this work exhibits a metric structure that shares the same notion of distance present in models embedded in a euclidean space like , say , @xmath2 .",
    "for sake of completeness and to stress the fact that the model does show metric structure , the sections vi and vii discuss , respectively , the degree distribution and an estimation of the shortest path length between two randomly chosen vertices in the graph . some final comments are made in the section viii .",
