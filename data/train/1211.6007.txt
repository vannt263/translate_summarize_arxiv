    "in turbulence flow , helicity is an important physical quantity . it is widespread in the motions of the atmosphere",
    ", ocean circulation and other natural phenomena , and also found in leading edge and trailing vortices shed from wings and slender bodies @xcite .",
    "helicity can be defined as , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the velocity and vorticity of the turbulence flow respectively , and _ h _ is a pseudoscalar quantity .",
    "similar with the status of energy in the dynamics of ideal fluids , helicity has the character of inviscid invariance .",
    "this physical property determines that helicity is an important quantity in turbulence research .",
    "recently , the researches on helical turbulence have developed greatly in theoretical research , experiment and numerical simulation .",
    "based on the helical decomposition of velocity , the mechanism of existing a joint forward cascade of energy and helicity has been explained in theory@xcite .",
    "cascades existing in helical turbulence have space scale and time scale@xcite , and the researches showed that the existing space scale of helicity cascade was large than energy cascade . in the inertial range ,",
    "the joint cascade of energy and helicity was dominated by the energy cascade time scale in the low wave number and by the helicity cascade time scale in high wave number . using direct numerical simulation of isotropic turbulence ,",
    "energy and helicity flux were studied , the research showed that helicity flux is more intermittent than the energy flux and the spatial structure were much finer @xcite .    large eddy simulation ( les ) , as a important method , has been used to research helical turbulence .",
    "several kinds of sgs models have been proposed so far , such as eddy - viscosity model , dynamic model , vortex model , subgrid - scale estimation model , and even the developing constrained sgs model @xcite .",
    "although so many types of sgs model , there are few models on account of the character of helical turbulence .",
    "proposed a two - term dynamic mixed models ( dsh ) to do large eddy simulations of helical turbulence @xcite .",
    "compared the les results of the dsh model with other traditional models , the improvement of dsh model was not so reamarkable.in this paper , we first use the balance of helicity dissipation and helicity flux across the inertial range to get the eddy viscosity , then deduce a new helical model ( sr ) . using sr model and dynamic sr model ( dsr)to do large eddy simulation of isotropic helical turbulence , we find that sr and dsr models can predict energy and helicity well .",
    "contrast with dynamic smogorinsky model ( dsm ) and dsh model , the new helical model is a simple model and its results of les has get an obvious improvement .",
    "in isotropic helical turbulence , the forced helicity control equation can be get from the n - s equation , as below @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the strain rate tensor and @xmath5 is the symmetric vorticity gradient tensor .",
    "@xmath6 is the force , and @xmath7 is the flux term , which can be expressed as @xmath8 for les , the resolved helicity can be defined as @xmath9 , and we can get the control function of @xmath10@xcite through filtering the eq.(1 ) at scale @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sgs helicity dissipation rate , and @xmath14 is the sgs stress .    the equation for the resolved helicity in statistically stationary forced isotropic helical turbulence can be obtained through taking the ensemble average of eq.(3 ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the total helicity dissipation ) @xmath18 is the sgs helicity dissipation , and @xmath19 is the viscous helicity dissipation at scale @xmath11 .    in the same way , we can also get the equation for the resolved energy in statistically stationary forced isotropic helical turbulence @xcitefrom the filtered ns equation as @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the total helicity dissipation ) , @xmath23 is the sgs energy dissipation and @xmath24 is the viscous energy dissipation at scale @xmath11 .    from eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) , we can see that the helicity dissipation has the similar form and composition as the energy dissipation .    in the inertial range of isotropic helical turbulence",
    ", the viscosity of the flow may be ignored , therefor we can get the helicity and energy relations@xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26    at the same time , the average of the energy flux across the inertial range is invariable and equals to the sgs energy dissipation , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy flux across the inertial range . similar with energy , helicity has the same character in inertial subrange , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the helicity flux across the inertial range .    in large eddy simulation of isotropic helical turbulence",
    ", we take the eddy - viscosity model as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the eddy viscosity .",
    "based on the assumption of eq.(9 ) and eq.(10 ) , we can obtain @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sgs stress model .    in this deduction , we consider the eddy viscosity @xmath32 as a global averaged value@xcite for the time being , thus @xmath35    in isotropic helical turbulence , we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the energy and helicity spectra functions , and @xmath40 is the cut off wavenumber .    the energy and helicity spectra @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the inequality@xcite as @xmath41    in the inertial range , the energy and helicity spectra@xcite can be choosed as @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 is kolmogrov constant and @xmath45 is the coefficient of the helicity spectrum .    substituting eq.(17 ) into eq.(14 ) , we can get @xmath46    from eq.(15 ) , we can see clearly that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a dimensionless parameter , its value changes with @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "when the cut wavenumber is in the inertial range , from eq.(16 ) , eq.(17 ) and eq.(19 ) , we obtain @xmath51    taking the absolute value of both side of eq.(18 ) , and putting it into eq.(20 ) , we can get the expression @xmath52 then , from eq.(6 ) , ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 21 ) , we can obtain the expression of @xmath32 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the filter scale , @xmath55@xmath56 and the model coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we obtain a new helical sgs model as @xmath58    in the les model , @xmath48 is set to 2.0 and @xmath59 and @xmath45 is confirmed by the dns data about 1.35 .    in this letter",
    ", the eddy viscosity @xmath32 of the model may be given a local value , and the expression of @xmath32 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "thus we get the new helical model discussed in this letter ( sr model ) as @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the coefficient of helical model @xmath64 can also be decided dynamically , and then we get the dsr model in this letter .",
    "in this part , we will give _ a _ _ priori _ and _ a posteriori _ test of the les model , and do some comparison and analysis .    in order to validate our model ,",
    "a dns of three - dimensional incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence is introduced here .",
    "it solves the forced n - s equations using a pseudo spectral code in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , and the numerical resolution is @xmath65 .",
    "a guassian random field is the initial flow condition , and it has an energy spectrum as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the whole system is maintained by a constant energy input rate @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the first two wave number shells .",
    "have constructed the new helical models sr and dsr , we first test the validity of the models _ a priori_. in the inertial range , we have assumed the invariance of the energy and helicity sgs dissipations . in such a precondition , the invariance of @xmath71 and @xmath72 must hold , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the length scale varying in the inertial range .    in fig.1",
    ", we show @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the kolmogorov scale.it is easy to see that the values of the two functions in inertial range are almost constant , and it demonstrates the scale - invariance and the reasonableness of the model .",
    "we choose four les models to do some analysis and comparison here , the sr model , the dsr model , the dynamic smogorinsky model ( dsm ) and the dynamic mixed helical model ( dsh)@xcite .",
    "fig.2 and fig.3 display the energy and helicity spectra of dns and different models for steady isotopic turbulence respectively .",
    "the bolt solid line is for dns spectra , and the other lines are for the four models.it is easy to see that the sr and dsr show similar trends and predict the energy and helicity spectra better than dsm and dsh . in fig.2 ,",
    "dsm and dsh underestimate the energy spectra near the cutoff wave - number and overestimate at the middle range of the wave-number.in fig.3 , dsm and dsh overestimate the helicity spectra at the middle range of the wave - number , and dsh underestimates it seriously near the cutoff wave - number .    in fig.4 and fig.5",
    "we show the time evolution of the dns and four models energy and helicity spectra for a decay problem starting from a fully developed statistical steady state respectively , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in fig.4 ,",
    "similar with the steady prbolem , the sr and dsr also show similar trends and predict the energy spectra very well .",
    "dsm and dsh overestimate the energy spectra at the middle range of the wave - number and underestimate it near the cutoff wave - number .",
    "fig.5 show us the graphics different from fig.3 greatly.the helicity spectra have large fluctuation . because it is a free decaying course and helicity is a pseudoscalar quantity , the two factors cause such phenomenon . in fig.5 we can still see sr and dsr pridict the helicity spectra a little better than the other two models .",
    "fig.6 and fig.7 show us the sgs energy and helicity dissipations of dns and the four models distribute with @xmath76 for @xmath80 @xmath81 respectively , and they reflect case of the full developed steady turbulence .",
    "it is obvious from in the inertial range that the sgs energy and helicity dissipations from sr are closer to those of the dns than other models , and specially have the similar change trends with dns .    in fig.8 and fig.9",
    ", we show the decay of sgs energy and helicity dissipation with @xmath82(@xmath83 is the initial large eddy turnover time scale ) from a fully developed steady state for @xmath84 at the filter scale @xmath11 respectively .",
    "it is clear in fig.8 that the sgs energy dissipations from sr and dsr are closer to the dns result than dsm and dsh , and also have similar change trend . and",
    "also we can see in fig.9 that the sgs helicity dissipations from sr , dsr and dsm are closer to the dns result than dsh .    in fig.10,we display the distribution of high - order velocity increment with @xmath11 , where @xmath85 is the separation distance and @xmath11 is the filter scale .",
    "fig.10 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) denote the fourth - order , sixth - order and eighth - order structure functions of the longitudinal velocity increment of dns and the four models distribute with separation distance .",
    "we can from fig.10 that the result from sr is closest to the dns result very well in the range of @xmath86 , and the behavior of dsr is a little better than dsh and dsm .",
    "while in the range of @xmath87 , anyone of the models have still not given a rather good result .",
    "in this letter , we construct a new helical sgs stress model for large eddy simulation of the isotropic helical turbulence .",
    "different other eddy viscosity model , we conduct the helical model based on the balance of helicity dissipation and the average of helicity flux across the inertial range in helical turbulence . then we have tested the scale - invariance of the model for @xmath80 @xmath81 in inertial range , and make sure the validity of the helical model .",
    "we have given a constant coefficient helical model and a dynamic helical model here .",
    "have tested from @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath80 @xmath88 , the helical model is confirmed to predict energy and helicity spectra accurately , and also gives rather good simulating results in energy and helicity dissipation , @xmath89 @xmath90.besides the advantages above all , the helical model is a single model and can improve the computing efficiency greatly . as a sgs model on account of helical turbulence , it can also apply to the rotational turbulence .",
