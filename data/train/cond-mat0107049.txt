    "strongly correlated electron systems have been studied extensively over the past two decades and produced a plethora of new and intriguing results . among these systems are exotic heavy - fermion superconductors,@xcite heavy - fermion paramagnets , ferromagnets or antiferromagnets with tiny moments,@xcite spin glasses,@xcite kondo insulators@xcite and non - fermi liquids.@xcite heavy - fermion compounds are often referred to as the `` concentrated limit '' of dilute kondo alloys , because the local spin fluctuations arising from the hybridization of the @xmath1 electrons with conduction - band states have essentially the same origin as has the single impurity kondo effect .",
    "the kondo - lattice concept can consistently explain many of the bulk properties of ce - based heavy - fermion compounds , in particular the formation of a narrow coherent heavy - fermion band with @xmath1 symmetry at low temperatures.@xcite it also provides a single scaling temperature @xmath2 characterizing the properties of the system at low temperatures .",
    "now an intriguing question arises : what length scales should be associated with ( i ) the coherent quasiparticle state and ( ii ) the correlations arising from the single impurity kondo effect ?",
    "in other words , will a heavy - fermion system keep its bulk properties when one of more dimensions are reduced ?    in this paper , we address these queries by studying the transport properties of thin films of cecu@xmath3 as a function of their thickness .",
    "cecu@xmath3 is an archetypal heavy - fermion system with one of the largest known electronic specific heat coefficients@xcite and no magnetic or superconducting transition down to 20  mk.@xcite this makes it an ideal system to study the ground - state properties of the heavy - fermion state .",
    "furthermore , it has attracted great attention in the past few years due its proximity to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) . when doping with gold ( cecu@xmath4au@xmath5 ) non - fermi liquid behavior",
    "is observed in cecu@xmath6au@xmath7 and an antiferromagnetic ground state is found for @xmath8.@xcite our main result is that as the thickness of the films is decreased , the heavy fermi - liquid state is suppressed , and the behavior becomes that of a dilute kondo - impurity system .",
    "this result can best be explained with an increase of the characteristic temperature scale @xmath2 as the thickness of the films is decreased .",
    "we argue that the proximity of cecu@xmath3 to the qcp can account for a correlation length of the quantum fluctuations of ca .  10  nm , which leads to the increase of @xmath2 as the thickness of the films approaches this length .",
    "the thin films of cecu@xmath3 , with thicknesses ranging from around 10  nm to around 200  nm , were prepared by co - sputtering under ultra - high vacuum conditions from two targets of pure cu ( 99.99% ) and ce ( ames laboratory , 99.995% ) . they were deposited onto si(100 ) substrates with a si@xmath9n@xmath10 buffer layer at a temperature of 350@xmath11c , and subsequently covered in - situ at room temperature against oxidation with a si layer . thickness and composition of the films",
    "were determined by electron - probe microanalysis and rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) .",
    "the films are found to be homogeneous both in - plane and as a function of depth , and have sharp interfaces with substrate and protection layer .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements demonstrate that the films are polycrystalline ( orthorhombic structure ) with lattice parameters within 0.1% of those found for bulk samples,@xcite and show a slightly preferred orientation of the @xmath12-axis in growth direction . as the thickness of the films is reduced , no variations of the lattice constants , nor of the preferred orientation , are observed .",
    "high resolution electron microscopy ( hrem ) has enabled us to prove that the grain size is the same in films of thickness 189  nm and 53  nm , and of the order of 10  nm , independent of film thickness .",
    "also our rbs measurements have enabled us to put an upper limit of 2  at.% on oxygen content .",
    "resistance measurements were performed on structured samples in a four - probe geometry ( 50200  @xmath13 m wide and 23  mm between the voltage contacts ) in applied magnetic fields up to 8  t and at temperatures down to 20  mk .",
    "we have shown in an earlier publication@xcite that for a film of thickness 189  nm , the measurements of resistance versus temperature and those of the magnetoresistance mimic the properties of bulk samples , establishing the formation of a heavy fermi - liquid state at low temperatures in such thick films .",
    "the resistivity data in zero magnetic field as a function of temperature is shown for samples of various thickness in fig .",
    "[ fig : resall ] .",
    "the absolute values were normalized to those measured at room temperature .",
    "this allows a better comparison of the different samples , by removing uncertainties due to the determination of the thickness ( @xmath1410% ) .",
    "moreover , we are not able to subtract non - magnetic contributions to the resistivity , such as phonon contributions  this would require the fabrication of lacu@xmath3 thin films . at high temperatures ,",
    "the logarithmic temperature scale enables us to compare these results to a dilute kondo system , in which the temperature dependence of the resistivity is @xmath15 .",
    "there is no clear range of temperatures for the any sample in which this logarithmic behavior is clearly observed .",
    "crystalline electric field ( cef ) effects complicate the simple kondo picture at temperatures of the order of 50  k , due to the occupancy of higher lying cef levels.@xcite the general tendency at high temperatures is that the slope @xmath16 is lower for thinner films than for thicker films .    at low temperatures",
    ", we see that large differences are found between the thick films and the thin films .",
    "whereas for the thick films , there is a clear maximum of the resistivity @xmath17 at a temperature @xmath18 followed by a large drop upon lowering the temperature , in contrast the resistivity just saturates for the thinnest films .",
    "the absolute values of the residual resistivity @xmath19 do not show any clear thickness dependence .",
    "they are shown as a function of film thickness @xmath20 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ( right axis ) .",
    "the black bar represents the approximate range of values found in literature  averaged over the three crystallographic directions for single crystals .",
    "two remarks can be made based on these measurements : ( i ) the dependence of the residual resistivity on the thickness is very weak , proving that no additional disorder is induced when the samples are made thinner ; ( ii ) the values of the residual resistivity clearly lie in a metallic regime , well below the ioffe - regel limit where the mean free path @xmath21 is equal to the interatomic distance , which for cecu@xmath3 would give a maximum resistivity of 300  @xmath22  cm for a metallic state .",
    "also in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] are shown the values of @xmath18 as a function of thickness ( grey symbols , left axis ) .",
    "the bulk values found in the literature are as high as 15  k for particular crystallographic directions . a clear tendency toward suppression of @xmath18",
    "is found as the thickness of the films is decreased .    for @xmath23  nm ,",
    "fermi - liquid behavior is found@xcite at very low temperatures ( @xmath24  mk ) , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the fermi - liquid coefficient related to the effective mass @xmath27 of the quasiparticles by @xmath28.@xcite the values obtained for @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acoeff ] as a function of film thickness . for comparison ,",
    "the values found in literature for bulk samples are symbolized by the grey bar on the right side of the figure .",
    "there is a dramatic decrease of @xmath26 as the thickness of the samples is reduced . below 50",
    "nm this drop is better viewed on a logarithmic scale , as seen in the inset .",
    "overall , the value of @xmath26 decreases by nearly four orders of magnitude , which should be contrasted with a maximum difference by a factor of five between the different bulk samples .",
    "for the thinnest films of 11  nm and 12  nm , the resistivity just saturates down to lowest temperatures , and no value of @xmath26 can be defined .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that the _ heavy _ fermi liquid state is suppressed in our thinnest films .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is also strongly thickness dependent : the magnitude of the negative mr decreases as the thickness is decreased for all temperatures below 10  k. this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] where measurements of the mr in an applied field of 4  t were performed .",
    "the mr is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the thickest film ( 189  nm ) shows the typical mr of a kondo lattice system , with an increasingly negative mr as the temperature is lowered , followed by a minimum and an increase of the mr which is due to the onset of coherence and the hf state . in the thinnest films ,",
    "the mr effect is much weaker , and there is no minimum , proving again that the coherent state is suppressed .    to summarize our experimental findings",
    ", we observe a dramatic suppression of the heavy - fermion state in the ground state of cecu@xmath3 as the thickness of the films is reduced . whereas the residual resistivity @xmath19 and the xrd measurements prove that the intrinsic disorder is not changed as the films are made thinner , characteristic signatures of the heavy - fermion ground state such as the high fermi - liquid coefficient @xmath26 and the sharp minimum in the mr are reduced , and even completely suppressed in our thinnest films .",
    "as mentioned previously , the quality of the thin films was carefully analyzed , so that external effects such as preferred orientation changes , the grain structure or oxygen contamination can , as far as we can determine , be excluded as possible explanations for the observed thickness dependence .",
    "this striking effect is therefore an intrinsic property of cecu@xmath3 , and we will now consider possible scenarios for this thickness - dependence property of the correlated state .",
    "as we have seen , the most common model used to describe heavy - fermion systems is that of the kondo lattice .",
    "let us first take this model as a starting point in our discussion and see whether reducing the sample dimensions can lead to our results .",
    "we can approach this in two ways : the _ single impurity _",
    "kondo scattering is affected by a reduction of the size of the samples ( scenario i ) , or the kondo temperature itself is size dependent ( scenario ii ) , affecting the electron - electron interactions leading to the coherent state in the kondo lattice .    finally , in scenario iii",
    ", we will also put forward an alternative way of looking at cecu@xmath3 , based on the fact that this system lies close to a quantum critical point .",
    "let us first remark that it is not simply the coherence that is lost when the thickness is reduced .",
    "if that were the case , cecu@xmath0 would just cross over from a periodic kondo system to a dense independent - impurity kondo system .",
    "the resistivity would increase down to zero temperature , with no change at high temperatures , leading to a strong increase of the residual resistivity .",
    "also the magnitude of the mr would not change at the minimum,@xcite as opposed to the large suppression we observe for thinner films .",
    "it is generally accepted by now that the original picture of a `` kondo cloud '' with finite spatial extension of spin - polarized electrons screening the magnetic moment of the kondo impurity@xcite is not correct .",
    "this follows both from theoretical considerations@xcite and experimental results.@xcite however , a number of experimental observations were made on the size dependence of the kondo effect , mostly using thin films or thin wires of very dilute kondo alloys , e.g. _ au_fe@xcite or _",
    "cu_cr.@xcite no clear picture emerges from these experimental results , since in some cases a size effect is indeed observed@xcite and in other cases not.@xcite what these results have in common though , is that _ the kondo temperature appears to be constant_. the size effect on the transport properties , if any , shows a reduction of the kondo scattering term in thinner films or wires*scenario i*.    two different theoretical models have been put forward to explain these results . the first , by jsghy et al.@xcite considers the effect of spin - orbit interaction of the conduction electrons with the magnetic impurity .",
    "this interaction induces an impurity - spin anisotropy close to the surface of the sample , which reduces the effective thickness contributing to the kondo scattering of the conduction electrons .",
    "while this may explain the observed reduction of the logarithmic slope of the resistivity of cecu@xmath3 films as a function of temperature at high temperatures , such a scenario can not explain our observation that at low temperatures , the fermi - liquid coefficient is completely suppressed in films of 10  nm thickness .",
    "the second model , by martin et al.@xcite describes how the interplay between spin scattering ( kondo ) and weak localization ( disorder ) can modify the coefficient of the @xmath30 dependence of the resistivity",
    ". however , their theory only applies in the very dilute case , in which normal impurity scattering leading to weak localization dominates over spin scattering .",
    "cecu@xmath3 obviously does not belong to this category .      within the kondo lattice model for heavy - fermions ,",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath31 is the fundamental energy scale of the system .",
    "other commonly used energy scales , such as the coherence temperature or the rkky temperature , can be directly related to @xmath31 .",
    "returning to the analogy with dilute kondo systems , let us consider a _ thickness - dependent kondo temperature _ as a possible cause of our results*scenario ii*. from fermi - liquid theory , @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath32 , the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level squared .",
    "our measurements thus show that the dos at the fermi level is reduced in thinner films .",
    "the kondo temperature is related to the dos at the fermi level via @xmath33 provided the kondo interaction is much greater than the rkky interaction,@xcite i.e.  @xmath34 with @xmath35 the magnetic coupling .",
    "an increase of the kondo temperature @xmath31 with decreasing thickness is in qualitative agreement with our results : an increased @xmath31 reduces the magnetic interactions at low temperature and therefore suppresses the heavy fermi - liquid state .",
    "unfortunately , transport measurements do not allow us to determine unambiguously the kondo temperature in our system .",
    "the maximum in the resistivity @xmath18 results from the onset of coherence in the heavy fermi - liquid state and is therefore not a good measure for @xmath31 .",
    "the mr results can provide better information about the kondo temperature .",
    "the calculations by kawakami and okiji@xcite show that for decreasing @xmath36 , the amplitude of the mr decreases .",
    "the change of amplitude in the mr of a factor of 5 as we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] can be explained by an increase of @xmath31 by about a factor of 4 .",
    "as is the case for @xmath18 , we can not use the position of the minimum of the mr as a measure for @xmath31 , since we cross over from a kondo lattice to an independent kondo impurity system .    to explain the observed size dependence of kondo scattering in point - contact experiments also a variation of the kondo temperature with size",
    "was put forward.@xcite the theoretical explanation , given by zarnd and udvardi,@xcite is not based on a decrease of the dos but rather on fluctuations of the local dos near the surface of the point contact .",
    "for very small point contacts , the contribution of strong fluctuations of the local dos near the surface of the point contact leads to the observation of an enhanced `` effective '' kondo temperature . the smaller the value of the bulk kondo temperature , the larger the enhancement in small point contacts .",
    "we do not believe that such an explanation can hold for our thin films of cecu@xmath3 : firstly , the effects we observe occur at very large film thickness as compared to the length scales over which one may expect fluctuations of the dos.@xcite second , the kondo temperature of the compounds that were studied in the point contact experiments were one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of cecu@xmath3 , which has a bulk kondo temperature of the order of 1  k.    whether scenario ii can form the basis for explaining our results is highly debatable .",
    "this scenario is based on a comparison with a dilute kondo model , with all its shortcomings when applying it to a kondo lattice system : one of them lies in the assumption of no residual interactions or magnetic ordering appearing on the periodic ce lattice .",
    "indeed , even for large @xmath31 , interactions and antiferromagnetic order do remain a possibility at low temperatures and thereby the transport properties would be modified accordingly.@xcite      in order to get a deeper physical feeling for the observed effects , let us take a step back , and attempt to describe cecu@xmath0 in a more general manner , our * scenario iii*. we already mentioned that cecu@xmath0 lies very close to a magnetic instability .",
    "whether or not it does actually order antiferromagnetically at very low temperatures is still debatable,@xcite but there is not much needed to trigger such a transition : doping the system with gold leads to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state for cecu@xmath37 with @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qcp ] ) .",
    "it is now believed that the non - fermi liquid behavior observed at @xmath39 arises from the quantum critical point ( qcp ) at that doping concentration .",
    "the general picture is the following ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qcp ] ) : when describing the thermodynamics of a quantum system in @xmath40 dimensions , the expression for its partition function maps onto a classical partition function for a system with @xmath41 dimensions ; the extra dimension is finite in extent and has units of time:@xcite @xmath42 . at @xmath43 ,",
    "the quantum system undergoes a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) when the strength @xmath44 of the quantum fluctuations is changed and becomes equal to a critical value @xmath45 : these fluctuations play the role of the thermal fluctuations in the classical system .",
    "therefore , using our knowledge of critical phenomena , a spatial correlation length @xmath46 diverges as @xmath47 with a critical exponent @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , there must be a correlation ` length ' @xmath49 in temporal direction , which may have a different critical behavior than @xmath46 because of the possibly different nature of the correlations in space and in time , respectively . quite generally , the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath49 is governed by the dynamical exponent @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the effect of finite temperatures is to cut - off the low - frequency fluctuations via @xmath52 .",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath53 of the system is the temperature at which the cut - off frequency @xmath54 is equal to the coherence frequency @xmath55 .",
    "this temperature marks a crossover with increasing temperature from a @xmath56- to a @xmath40-dimensional system .",
    "now , when the thickness of the films is decreased , the spatial correlation length @xmath46 is cut - off at the thickness @xmath20 of the film for sufficiently small @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to an effective increase of the coherence frequency , since now @xmath57 . for sufficiently small @xmath20 ,",
    "the coherence ` length ' in temporal direction is now directly related to the thickness of the films , and therefore also the characteristic temperature @xmath53 is related to @xmath20 for sufficiently small @xmath20 : @xmath58    we have seen that it is difficult to determine the temperature scale of our system based on transport measurements only .",
    "we believe that the fermi - liquid coefficient @xmath26 is the most physical quantity that we can extract . without requiring any of the concepts of kondo theory , we can still relate @xmath26 to @xmath53 .",
    "we know from landau fermi - liquid theory that @xmath59 .",
    "dimensional analysis requires that @xmath60 .",
    "our experiments suggest a linear relationship between @xmath26 and the film thickness @xmath20 .",
    "putting these results in eq .",
    "[ eq : t ] , we obtain @xmath61 .    to explain our results within the framework of quantum criticallity , we sketched in fig .",
    "5 a phase diagram where @xmath62 is put on the horizontal axis , which normally measures the strength of the fluctuations . for , by decreasing the thickness of the films , we are increasing the characteristic temperature @xmath53 thus moving away from the qcp .",
    "this suggests that moving away from the nel ordered state enhances the quantum spin fluctuations and therefore suppresses the heavy fermion state , especially with a dimensionality reduction . in the phase diagram",
    ", this is equivalent to moving towards the left on the horizontal axis , or to stretching the @xmath63-axis and thereby pulling up the line describing @xmath53 . we do not observe a significant increase of the residual resistivity due to this enhancement of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath53 was recently confirmed by measurements by pfleiderer et al.@xcite they find that @xmath26 tends to diverge as @xmath53 becomes zero at the qcp , proving that heavy - fermion behavior is enhanced as one approaches the qcp .",
    "the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath61 is quite unusual , since this would mean that the spatial correlation length diverges faster than the temporal correlation length as the qcp is approached .",
    "the expected value of @xmath50 for an antiferromagnetic system is 2 , and is confirmed by the nfl behavior at the critical point , assuming 2-dimensional afm fluctuations.@xcite we therefore wish to stress here that the arguments we used to determine @xmath50 were merely qualitative , and that in order to confirm this picture of the hf system cecu@xmath0 , measurements of thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat or the susceptibility in these thin films would be more appropriate .",
    "they are unfortunately very difficult to perform in view of the small available volume in thin films .",
    "a length scale @xmath46 of 10  nm might seem very large at first sight .",
    "however , we are dealing with particularly `` slow '' quasiparticles , with a typical velocity @xmath64 that is a factor 1000 lower than free electrons in normal metals .",
    "also we have a system with a low characteristic energy scale @xmath65 of about 1  k , which can be estimated , e.g. , from the temperature where the coherent state becomes important . this characteristic energy corresponds to a time scale , @xmath66  s , leading indeed to a characteristic length of @xmath67  nm .",
    "it is actually this very low value of @xmath2 that is believed to make cecu@xmath3 and other so - called `` kondo lattice '' compounds heavy - fermion systems .",
    "our measurements on thin films of cecu@xmath3 have exhibited a dramatic change of the ground state properties upon approaching a thickness of the order of 10  nm .    because cecu@xmath3 is usually described as a kondo lattice system ,",
    "we have attempted to reconcile our results with the properties of a _ dilute _ kondo system .",
    "a size effect of the kondo effect itself ( * scenario i * ) , as observed experimentally in dilute kondo systems , does not account for the scaling of characteristic energies that we observe as a function of thickness ( @xmath26 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the characteristic energy of the kondo lattice model is the kondo temperature @xmath31 , and a thickness dependence of @xmath31 can qualitatively explain our results ( * scenario ii * ) .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this scenario also applies to a kondo lattice , and why fluctuations of the dos should occur at the relatively large length scale of around 10  nm .    the proximity of cecu@xmath3 to a quantum critical point has led us to seek an explanation in terms of another description of cecu@xmath3 ( * scenario iii * ) .",
    "the physics of a system near a qcp is governed by two correlation lengths , @xmath68 in the time direction , and @xmath46 in spatial direction , that diverge as one approaches the qcp .",
    "when , as is the case for cecu@xmath3 , the quantum fluctuations are so large that the system is not ordered at @xmath43 , @xmath68 sets a characteristic temperature scale @xmath2 above which the system `` loses '' one dimension . because @xmath68 and @xmath46 are coupled through the dynamical critical exponent @xmath50 , an effective reduction of one spatial dimension below @xmath46 has the effect of increasing the characteristic temperature scale @xmath2 .",
    "this leads on the one hand to a `` stretching '' of the temperature axis , i.e.  a flattening of resistivity as a function of temperature . on the other hand",
    ", it leads to a lower dos at the fermi level , and hence to a weakening of the correlations ( decrease of @xmath26 ) .",
    "this scenario therefore provides a reasonable `` starting point '' for the length scale that was found in our experiments although we can not explain the very small values of @xmath26 for the thinnest films and the residual resistivity does not reflect the increase of the quantum fluctuations .",
