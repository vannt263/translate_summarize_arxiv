    "as the canonical example of topological order , the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect was originally discovered in two - dimensional electron gas subject to a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "@xcite recently , several groups demonstrated numerically that these strongly - correlated phases also exist in a topological flat band characterized by a non - zero chern number @xmath0 , even in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite this discovery of the so - called fractional chern insulators ( fci ) generated enormous interest .",
    "@xcite subsequent numerical studies  @xcite quickly confirmed the presence of more intricate single - component fqh states in lattice models  @xcite , such as the read - rezayi series  @xcite and the composite - fermion states  @xcite .",
    "powerful techniques from the study of fqh , including density algebra ,  @xcite entanglement spectrum ,  @xcite parton construction ,  @xcite and the hamiltonian theory of composite fermions ,  @xcite were introduced to understand the topological ground state of fci and the nature of its excitations .",
    "@xcite possible experimental realizations have also been proposed .",
    "@xcite    most of the above progress dealt with a topological band with chern number @xmath1 , which is essentially the same  @xcite as the continuum fqh in a periodic potential  @xcite . the strongly - correlated physics in a @xmath2 chern band  @xcite turned out much richer than the conventional fqh , due to the interplay between topological order and lattice structure .",
    "@xcite barkeshli and qi  @xcite mapped a @xmath2 chern band to a @xmath0-component lowest landau level ( lll ) using hybrid wannier states  @xcite , and suggested the possibility to realize multicomponent fqh states in a single chern band .",
    "numerical studies  @xcite indeed found clear signature of such states , including the color @xmath3 version of the halperin  @xcite and the non - abelian spin - singlet states  @xcite ( nass ) , but also identified qualitative deviations from these states ,  @xcite which implies a more complex structure than proposed in ref .  .",
    "in a previous paper ,  @xcite we proposed to understand these new features as the consequences of a special set of boundary conditions associated with the lll mapping . in the simplest case , this alternative boundary condition can be understood as a color - dependent magnetic flux insertion .",
    "we demonstrated that the multicomponent lll in a new bloch basis can be seen as a single manifold with constant berry curvature and chern number @xmath0 . using pseudopotential hamiltonians , we constructed model states for fci with an arbitrary chern number , and found high overlaps with the exact ground states .",
    "crucially , our model states correctly capture the anomalous features in the particle entanglement spectrum of the @xmath2 fci that make our states distinct from the conventional multicomponent fqh states .    in this paper",
    "we provide details of the mapping between a chern band and a multicomponent lll , and demonstrate the distinctive features of our pseudopotential hamiltonian due to the new boundary conditions .",
    "we construct , in a @xmath0-component lll , a momentum - space bloch basis and a hybrid wannier basis that mimic the lattice counterparts .",
    "both bases entangle the real space and the internal color space . using the explicit one - body wave functions for the bases",
    ", we derive the representation of the projected density operators in both bases .",
    "we define model states as the exact zero modes of the pseudopotential hamiltonian built from the projected density operators . as we demonstrated in our previous paper  @xcite ,",
    "the bloch basis is useful for numerical studies as it preserves the full lattice symmetry . the hybrid wannier basis , on the other hand , facilitates the analysis of the pseudopotential hamiltonian .",
    "we give a detailed analysis of the simplest bosonic pseudopotential hamiltonian for the halperin color - entangled states .",
    "we show that the pseudopotential hamiltonian reduces to _ almost _ classical electrostatics in the hybrid wannier basis , when we take the so - called thin - torus limit  @xcite and carry out truncations motivated by previous numerical results .",
    "@xcite this enables us to write down the form of its zero modes in this limit .",
    "however , in contrast to most well - known fqh states such as laughlin and read - rezayi , a purely classical thin - torus description is not possible .",
    "we pinpoint the key difference from the conventional multicomponent fqh due to a subtle twist in the hybrid wannier states , and detail the procedure to compute the total bloch momentum of each zero mode .",
    "the resulting algorithm correctly predicts the degeneracy of the fci quasiholes in each lattice momentum sector , without resorting to numerical diagonalization , and can be seen as the extension of the generalized pauli principle  @xcite to the color - entangled states .",
    "in this section we construct one - body bases in a multicomponent lll that mimic the bloch and the wannier bases in a chern band with an arbitrary chern number @xmath0 . for simplicity .",
    "the case of @xmath4 can be handled by inverting , say , the @xmath5 direction of the landau level .",
    "] we consider a @xmath0-component ( generalized spin ) electron moving on a torus with a perpendicular uniform magnetic field . the major difference between our approach and the usual treatment of the multicomponent lll problem is the adoption of a new set of boundary conditions .",
    "this alternative choice entangles together the @xmath0 components and enables us to construct a single manifold of bloch states with chern number @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the usual picture of multicomponent lll as @xmath0 separate manifolds ( one for each of the @xmath0 components ) each with unity chern number , our bases provide a natural foundation for the mapping to a single chern band with an arbitrary chern number @xmath0 .",
