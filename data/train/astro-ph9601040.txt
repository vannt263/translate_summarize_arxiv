    "models of the milky way can be usefully divided into three classes : ( i ) photometric models , ( ii ) kinematic models , and ( iii ) dynamical models .",
    "models of the first type were pioneered by kapteyn and shapley , a more recent example is given by bahcall & soneira ( 1980 ) .",
    "these models specify the distribution of stars without saying anything about their motions .",
    "the models of bienaym et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and ratnatunga et al .",
    "( 1989 ) are typical kinematic models : they specify both the distribution and the motions of stars .",
    "however , in these models the velocity distribution at each point must be somehow specified without fully exploiting newton s laws of motion . in practice",
    "the galaxy is decomposed into ` components ' such as the thin disk , the thick disk , the metal - poor halo etc , and at each point in space each component is assigned an ellipsoidal , usually gaussian , velocity distribution .",
    "one might hope to use the jeans equations to couple the ellipsoids assigned at neighboring points , but eddington ( 1915 ) already showed that this is feasible only if the potential is of stckel s special form , which it almost certainly is not .",
    "so the velocity ellipsoid at each point in each component must be arbitrarily assigned at risk being dynamically impossible . in consequence",
    ", models of this type may have a role to play as representations of observational data , but they by no means fully exploit the potential of stellar surveys .",
    "this contribution emphasizes the value of constructing models in which stellar dynamics plays an integral role , and explains why such models have until recently been of an extremely limited nature , and why the time is now ripe for them to come into their own .",
    "the basic result of galactic dynamics is that galaxies can be considered to be made up of orbits in a smooth gravitational potential . from this",
    "it follows that a prerequisite for dynamical modelling is an understanding of such orbits . in the simplest circumstances orbits in a steady three - dimensional potential",
    "are characterized by three ` isolating integrals , ' that is functions @xmath4 of position and velocity that are constant along any orbit . through the work of lindblad ( 1933 ) ,",
    "contopoulos ( 1963 ) , and hnon & heiles ( 1964 ) it has long been clear that most orbits in typical axisymmetric galactic potentials admit three such integrals .",
    "two integrals are available from elementary mechanics , @xmath5 , the star s energy , and @xmath6 , the star s angular momentum about the potential s symmetry axis .",
    "the problem is that , for most systems of interest , no general formula exists for a third integral , @xmath7 . by jeans theorem",
    ", the simplest assumption one can make on an equilibrium system is that the probability density @xmath8 , that a given star will be found at the phase - space point @xmath9 , is a function @xmath10 of three isolating integrals .",
    "hence ignorance of @xmath7 makes it impossible to express a general distribution function ( df ) @xmath11 in its simplest form .",
    "external galaxies have been modelled dynamically more extensively than has the milky way by the simple stratagem of ignoring @xmath7 ( e.g. , binney et al.1990 ) .",
    "when the observational data are sparse , this procedure can lead to acceptable models .",
    "unfortunately , it has been known since jeans classic ( 1915 ) paper that this stratagem can not lead to an acceptable model of the milky way , because it predicts that the velocity dispersions in the radial and vertical directions must be equal ; near the sun they differ by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "oort ( 1932 ) and lindblad ( 1933 ) decomposed the stellar motion into a vertical oscillation and the motion parallel to the plane .",
    "the latter can be further divided into azimuthal rotation and radial libration .",
    "let @xmath12 be cylindrical polar coordinates , then the difference between a star s energy @xmath13 and the energy @xmath14 associated with motion parallel to the plane provides an approximate form of @xmath7 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the energy of a circular orbit with angular momentum @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the energy associated with radial librations .",
    "this oort ",
    "lindblad form of @xmath7 plays a key role in all published determinations of the local mass density within the disk ( e.g. , bahcall 1984 , bienaym et al .",
    "1987 , kuijken & gilmore 1991 ) , and readily explains the schwarzschild velocity ellipsoid ( e.g. ,  4.2 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "in fact it enables one to explain the significant skewness of the observed distributions of @xmath19 velocities ( cuddeford & binney 1994 ) .",
    "however , ( [ ol ] ) is _ only an approximation _ and its limitations give rise to the leading uncertainty in the column density of the disk near the sun .",
    "the problem is that when @xmath20 is used as third integral , one necessarily finds that @xmath21 with the result that even away from the plane the velocity ellipsoid is aligned with the @xmath22- and @xmath23-axes .",
    "by contrast , if the galaxy s potential were spherically symmetric , the velocity ellipsoid would everywhere align with the direction to the galactic center",
    ". we can be sure that the real situation is intermediate between these two extremes , leading to a fundamental uncertainty of @xmath2410%20% in the local surface density ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 ) .    this inability of the o ",
    "l approximation to yield an unambiguous determination of the local vertical force @xmath25 and thus the disk s surface density is the more disappointing as the latter is one of the very few parameters of the galactic potential that is primarily determined from the o ",
    "l approximation .",
    "indeed the o ",
    "l approximation is applicable only to stars on nearly circular orbits ",
    "disk stars .",
    "these probe the potential only near the plane , and for most purposes the interstellar medium ( ism ) provides a more readily observed probe of the potential near the plane , since its radio - frequency spectral lines can be observed throughout the disk without hindrance from the dust which heavily obscures even moderately distant disk stars .",
    "consequently , the galaxy s circular - speed curve @xmath26 has long been determined from observations of the ism , and these data can in principle be used to determine @xmath27 near the plane ( merrifield 1993 , malhotra 1994 ) .",
    "the only way to improve substantially on the knowledge of the galactic potential that we have gleaned from observations of the ism is to study the dynamics of stars that move far from the plane and thus are high - velocity stars when in the solar neighborhood .",
    "l approximation does not apply to these stars , and some other approach to @xmath7 must be developed .",
    "how can we obtain adequate models of the orbits of high - velocity stars ?",
    "one possibility is directly to integrate the equations of motion . for each initial condition chosen , this produces a stream of phase - space positions @xmath28,k\\,{=}\\,1,n$ ] .",
    "two tasks must be addressed before a useful galaxy model can be based on this raw material : ( i ) characterize the orbits in some systematic way , such as assigning values of @xmath29 ; ( ii ) put the output data onto some sort of grid so that one can subsequently decide whether a given orbit will eventually pass through a given point @xmath30 , and , if so , with what velocity @xmath31 .",
    "a recent paper by zhao ( 1996 ) exemplifies this approach .",
    "zhao adopts a simple model of the rotating potential of the milky way s bulge and calculates several hundred orbits in it .",
    "he characterizes his orbits by energy and the time - averages along them of the angular momentum about the potential s long and spin axes .",
    "he uses the orbit s positions and velocities to determine associated occupation probabilities and velocities in each of 1000 spatial cells .",
    "merritt & fridman ( 1995 ) employ a very similar technique to model elliptical galaxies .",
    "the main difference between their work and zhao s is that they follow schwarzschild ( 1993 ) in characterizing orbits not by time - averaged angular momenta , but through their initial conditions . in this technique",
    "all orbits of a given energy are launched from one or more two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "these surfaces are carefully chosen so that ( a ) any orbit can be obtained by launching from some point of one of them , and ( b ) as far as possible , each point on the surfaces generates a distinct orbit .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath7 are simply the values taken by two convenient coordinates for the starting surface(s ) at the orbit s launching point .",
    "in oxford we have developed an entirely different technique which involves thinking of orbits as three - dimensional surfaces in six - dimensional phase space rather than as time - series ( kaasalainen & binney 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "these surfaces are topologically equivalent to tori , so we call this the `` torus method '' . at present the only three - dimensional orbits we can construct are axisymmetric ones . in this case",
    "each orbit is characterized by three special isolating integrals , the actions @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the generalization of the energy @xmath35 of equation ( [ oltwo ] ) ; @xmath36 is the generalization of @xmath20 in equation ( [ ol ] ) ; and @xmath37 is simply the angular momentum about the symmetry axis .    in place of the time - series @xmath38 above",
    "we obtain @xmath39 as fourier series in the so - called angle variables @xmath40 . along",
    "an orbit angle variables have the remarkable property of increasing linearly in time : @xmath41 , where the @xmath42 are constants characteristic of the torus .",
    "consequently , the probability that a star will be observed at any point on its torus is uniform in the variables @xmath43 .",
    "the actions are special in the following important sense .",
    "the phase - space volume occupied by orbits with actions in an elementary cube in integral space of size @xmath44 is @xmath45 . in other words , when one uses actions as integrals , equal volumes in integral ( or ` action ' ) space correspond to equal volumes in the full six - dimensional phase space .",
    "since the distribution function @xmath46 is a probability density in phase space , @xmath47 is by this result also the probability density in action space : @xmath48 is the probability that a star of population @xmath3 has actions in @xmath44 .",
    "this fact makes it easy to understand the physical implications of any particular form of the df @xmath49 of each population .",
    "consequently , when actions are used as integrals one knows from general astrophysical considerations in advance of detailed modelling roughly how @xmath49 should depend on its arguments . in fact",
    ", we will specify the functional form of @xmath49 and fit the data by merely adjusting a small number of parameters in the specified form .",
    "several high - velocity stellar populations may be distinguished spectroscopically , for example , rr - lyrae stars , blue - horizontal - branch stars , and low - metallicity subdwarfs .",
    "a dynamical model would associate to each of these sub - components a total number of stars @xmath51 and a df @xmath52 normalized such that @xmath53 = 1 . equipped with a model of this type , one could replicate within the computer any well - defined observational selection , i.e.predict the _ survey probability distribution _ for any survey .",
    "for example , flynn & freeman ( 1993 ) observed the radial velocities of a sample of stars that were photometrically selected to be m giants located about @xmath54 from the sun towards the south galactic pole .",
    "one can evaluate the model s corresponding survey probability distribution by selecting stars from the model according to precisely the same selection criteria and determining the distribution of radial velocities of these stars , and compare it with the observed distribution .",
    "the model would also predict the distribution of the stars proper motions , and these could be compared with any measured values .",
    "notice that in this comparison uncertainties in the distances to individual stars , that arose from , for example , a broad distribution in absolute magnitudes amongst the selected stars , would not play an important role so long as the absolute - magnitude distribution had been correctly modelled .",
    "it is easy to see that a model of the type just described unambiguously predicts the survey probability distributions for a bewilderingly large number of observational surveys .",
    "indeed , in whatever direction and in whatever magnitude range one selects stars of a given photometric or spectroscopic type , both the radial - velocity and proper - motion distributions are determined once @xmath1 , @xmath51 and @xmath49 have been chosen .",
    "of course , not all observations can be used to test the model ; some will be employed to determine @xmath1 , @xmath51 and @xmath49 and there will be nothing to be learnt by using the model to replicate these particular observations .",
    "so it is important to estimate how many observations will be needed to establish a model .",
    "the model depends upon a handful of three - dimensional objects : @xmath0 , and the @xmath52 .",
    "if we assume ( for the moment ) that the galaxy is axisymmetric , then @xmath1 is specified by the ism throughout the plane and we have to guess only how @xmath1 changes away from the plane . for any such guess we can determine @xmath49 in a large part of three - dimensional integral space merely by determining the velocity distribution of each population @xmath3 near the sun ( e.g. , may & binney 1986 ) . if the velocity distribution can be determined at one or two other well - chosen _ points _ in the galaxy , we can complete our knowledge of @xmath49 .",
    "so it should be possible to predict the outcome of infinitely many very different surveys from the results of just a handful of surveys ! of course , our predictions will only be as good as our guessed form of @xmath1 .",
    "but it is clear that we have very much less freedom in extending this function away from the plane than we potentially have information from even a moderate number of surveys .",
    "the reason why even limited observational work leads to more information than the models have freedom is that jeans theorem renders the galaxy a three - dimensional object , but one which we are privileged to observe in six - dimensional phase space .",
    "even when our observations of phase space are seriously deficient , so that , for example , we determine neither the radial velocities nor the distances of stars , we still observe the galaxy in more than three dimensions . consequently dynamics renders our observations highly degenerate , and they become stringent tests of our model .    the simplest , yet rather complicated , dynamical models for the stellar halo will start by assuming that the milky way is both axisymmetric and fully mixed .",
    "the first assumption is certainly incorrect for the centre of the galaxy , but this might have only little influence at large galactocentric distances .",
    "also , as we have learnt at this workshop ( majewski , this volume ) , the assumption of a well mixed halo is an over - simplification .",
    "however , the size of both effects , non - axisymmetry and non - mixedness , is unknown and can most easily be measured by comparing the data to such idealised models .",
    "to demonstrate the viability of our oxford approach and to illuminate the construction of our models and the prediction of survey probability distributions , we created a simple toy model and computed its predictions for a ngp proper motion survey .      in order to simplify the procedure we have chosen a scale free mass distribution consisting of a spheroid and a disk @xmath55 ^ 2 ) ^{-\\gamma/2 }       + 5.8 \\times 10 ^ 5 r^{-\\gamma } { \\rm sech}^2\\frac{z}{0.06r}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 measured in parsec .",
    "the spheroid s ellipticity is e2 , while the disk s vertical structure is given by the usual @xmath57 model with scale height @xmath58 .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that at @xmath59 we have @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 in agreement with observations .",
    "the local mass density is 0.013 and 0.055 @xmath63 for spheroid and disk , respectively .",
    "the gravitational potential is evaluated by inserting the ansatz ( with polar coordinates @xmath64 ) @xmath65,\\ ] ] into poisson s equation and solving for @xmath66 using a multipole expansion .",
    "the ansatz ( [ potential ] ) is chosen such that already a moderate number of multipoles gives the potential and forces to high accuracy .",
    "the advantage of choosing a scale invariant mass model is the existence of scaling relations , which reduce the number of independent dimensions of action space to two .",
    "it is well known that for the most gravitational potentials surfaces of constant energy in action space are nearly planes @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 being functions of @xmath70 . in the scale - free case , moreover , the shape of the energy surface is invariant under the scale transformation , hence @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constant . for our mass model",
    "we find @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73)}$ ] .",
    "an approximate df depending on energy is obtained with @xmath74 . if @xmath75 , then the system has radial density profile @xmath76)}$ ] . from this consideration",
    "we finally choose our stellar - halo df to be @xmath77^{2(\\gamma-\\beta)/(4-\\gamma)},\\ ] ] which yields @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , where we have taken @xmath82 .",
    "replacing @xmath83 in @xmath11 by @xmath84 produces a flattened and/or anisotropic model by shifting stars over energy surfaces . for our example",
    "we choose @xmath85 , which mainly shifts the stars to slightly higher @xmath34 , i.e.  to radially extended orbits .",
    "unlike the mass model , our model for the distribution of population i stars will be an exponential disk .",
    "suppose all disk stars were on exactly circular orbits .",
    "then the disk s df would be of the simple form @xmath86 and the mass @xmath87 with angular momentum between @xmath88 and @xmath89 would be @xmath90 .",
    "for an exponential disk , this must equal @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "expressing @xmath22 by the radius of the circular orbit with angular momentum @xmath88 , one thus finds @xmath93 we can get a vertically and radially warm disk by replacing the product of delta functions in ( [ cold_df ] ) by ( binney 1987 ) @xmath94 with the orbital frequencies @xmath95 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath96 determines the scale height as function of radius . using the observed relation @xmath97 and a similar one for @xmath98",
    ", we finally get @xmath99 { \\rm e}^ { r_{\\rm circ}(j_\\varphi)/r_d } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{diskdf } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have chosen the @xmath100 to result in @xmath101 and @xmath102 at @xmath103 . note that this simple form for the df of a dynamically warm , exponential disk is valid for _ any _ axisymmetric potential .      a survey probability distribution ( hereafter spd ) resulting from our dynamical model",
    "is easily evaluated by a monte carlo technique as follows .",
    "( i ) choose @xmath9 randomly from the @xmath49 ; ( ii ) assign stellar age , mass , and metallicity according to some simple models for the sfr , imf , and @xmath104-@xmath105 relation ; ( iii ) use stellar evolutionary models to find absolute magnitude and colours ; and ( iv ) ` observe ' the star by computing the apparent observables and applying the selection criteria of the survey to compare with . alternatively to using theoretical models of stellar evolution one could use some colour - magnitude relation as observed , say , for star clusters to assign ` stars ' to the phase space points .    as an example we computed from the above model for halo and disk the spd of proper motions in the ngp direction .",
    "the sfr was taken to set in 12 and 14 gyr ago for disk and halo , respectively , with exponential decay times of 12 and 2 gyr .",
    "the common imf was assumed to be of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 above and @xmath108 below @xmath109 with lower cutoff at @xmath110 .",
    "we assumed a gaussian @xmath105-distribution whose mean grows exponentially in time from @xmath111 initially to 0.04 today .",
    "stellar colours and magnitudes were otained using the models of rezini & voli ( 1981 ) and maeder ( 1981 & 1991 ) . to translate @xmath9 into distance and proper motion we used @xmath112pc and @xmath113 .",
    "the resulting spd for the disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spds ] , left ) clearly shows the effects of asymmetric drift : the steady downward shift in the centres of contours with increasing dispersion ( contour size ) .",
    "this effect becomes much more significant for more local surveys ( not shown ) . though non - rotating , the halo spd ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spds ] , right ) peaks near zero proper motion , since most halo stars are too far away to show significant proper motion ; the few nearby halo stars create the tail at @xmath114 .    in the joint distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - jspds ] , left ) the halo stars contribute negligibly .",
    "thus , in order to use the halo stars as dynamical tracers , one has either to go for deeper surveys ( fig .",
    "[ fig - jspds ] , right ) , or to disentangle disk and halo stars  for instance in our model there are hardly disk stars in the colour - magnitude range b@xmath11512 + 10(b@xmath116v ) .",
    "very considerable advantages flow from modelling the milky way in a way that exploits jeans powerful theorem .",
    "it is especially useful to model stellar populations that move far from the plane . what has held up this type of modelling for decades",
    "has been the difficulty of handling orbits that are constrained by a non - classical integral such as @xmath7 .",
    "several viable approaches to this problem are now available so that it should soon be possible to compare the new data that will flow from exciting observational tools such as hipparcos and the 2df with fully dynamical models .",
    "we have described some preliminary models based on the oxford torus technique . in this method each population is assigned a df @xmath49 that has a simple functional form , which describes the population s dynamical characteristics in astrophysically comprehensible terms . the parameters in @xmath49 are adjusted so as to optimize the fit between real catalogues and simulated ones . in principle",
    "_ any _ catalogue that has well - defined selection criteria can be simulated .",
    "the modelling process starts by guessing the milky way s potential @xmath117 .",
    "significant errors in this guess will lead to discrepancies between the real and simulated catalogues .",
    "since the fitting process is strongly over - determined , we are confident that we will be able to determine @xmath1 to reasonable accuracy by iteratively adjusting it until the real and simulated catalogues agree",
