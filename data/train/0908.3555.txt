    "entanglement generation by the indirect interaction between otherwise decoupled systems has been discussed in the literature mainly in the case of two - level atoms interacting with the common vacuum .",
    "the idea that dissipation can create rather then destroy entanglement in some systems , was put forward in several publications @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the effect of spontaneous emission on destruction and production of entanglement was discussed @xcite .",
    "when the two atoms are separated by a distance small compared to the radiation wave length , the collective properties of two - atomic systems can alter the decay process compared with the single atom .",
    "it was already shown by dicke @xcite that there are states with enhanced emission rates ( superradiant states ) and such that the emission rate is reduced ( subradiant states ) .",
    "( in the case of multi - atomic systems , similar collective effects described by tavis - cummings interaction @xcite can generate collective multiqubit entanglement @xcite ) .",
    "when the emission rate is reduced , two - atom system can decohere slower compared with individual atoms and some amount of initial entanglement can be preserved or even created by the indirect interaction between atoms .",
    "the analogous effect of production of entanglement was studied in a system of two - level atoms interacting with a squeezed vacuum . in that case , the squeezed vacuum is a source of nonclassical correlations which are essential for creation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the general condition under which entanglement can be induced by interaction with environment was also discovered @xcite .",
    "the case of two atoms immersed in a common thermal reservoir was also investigated @xcite .",
    "in particular , benatti and floreanini @xcite have discussed the dynamics of two independent atoms interacting with the reservoir of scalar particles at finite temperature and found the interesting behavior of the system .",
    "if the atoms are at finite separation , there is a temperature of the reservoir below which entanglement generation occurs .",
    "moreover , for the vanishing separation , the entanglement thus generated persists in the asymptotic state .",
    "in the present paper , we study the similar model but from a different perspective .",
    "we consider the system of two - level atoms interacting with the photon reservoir at fixed temperature . as in the vacuum case",
    ", the collective properties of the atomic system can alter the decay process compared with the single atom .",
    "there are states with enhanced emission rates and such that the emission rate is reduced .",
    "the important example of the latter is the singlet state @xmath0 i.e. antisymmetric superposition constructed from energy levels of considered atoms . as we show , in the regime of strong correlations the singlet state is decoupled from the environment and therefore is stable . in our considerations we focus on this case and investigate the stationary asymptotic states of the system . in",
    "turns out that the asymptotic states are parametrized by the fidelity @xmath1 of the initial state @xmath2 with respect to the state @xmath0 ( or the overlap of @xmath2 with singlet @xmath0 ) and the temperature @xmath3 of the photon reservoir .",
    "we identify the asymptotic states as the _ thermal generalization of werner states _ i.e. mixture of singlet state and gibbs equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath3 with the appropriate probability .",
    "( the standard werner states @xcite are recovered in the limit of infinite temperature ) .",
    "depending on the initial fidelity some of the asymptotic states are entangled .",
    "we calculate the amount of the asymptotic entanglement using a concurrence as its measure .",
    "we also show that if the initial fidelity is greater or equal to @xmath4 , then for every finite temperature of the reservoir the asymptotic entanglement is non - zero .",
    "on the other hand , for fidelity less then @xmath4 there is _ the critical temperature _ below which the asymptotic states are entangled whereas for higher temperatures all stationary states are separable .    since the initial states with the same fidelity can be separable or entangled , the dynamics given by the interaction with the reservoir manifests differently with respect to the entanglement properties of the system",
    ". it can create entanglement when the initial states are separable , disentangle initially entangled states , preserve some part of initial entanglement or even increase the initial entanglement of some states .",
    "we show on specific examples that this behavior of the dynamics really occurs . in particular , pure product states with orthogonal factor vectors",
    "become entangled in every temperature , whereas for other product states there is the critical temperature for creation of entanglement .",
    "similar phenomenon can be observed if the initial state is mixed .",
    "for example in the case of gibbs equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath5 which differs from the temperature @xmath3 of the reservoir , the creation of asymptotic entanglement happens if @xmath5 is much higher then @xmath3 . on the other hand , entangled initial states with maximal amount of entanglement can preserve some initial entanglement or can disentangle completely .",
    "it is worth to stress that this different behavior with respect to the thermal noise can happen for locally equivalent initial states , so by performing only local operations one can protect as much entanglement as possible .",
    "when the initial states are not maximally entangled , then the thermal noise can in some cases create entanglement which adds to the initial one , although during the evolution the purity is decreasing .",
    "we start with the sketch of the derivation of the dynamical equation describing the evolution of the system of atoms immersed in the thermal reservoir ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consider two - level atoms @xmath6 and @xmath7 with ground states @xmath8 and excited states @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , interacting with photon reservoir at temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics of the combined system consisting of the atoms and the quantum electromagnetic field is given by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sum of free hamiltonians of the atoms and the field and @xmath13 describes the interaction between the atoms and photons in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of the system of atoms , we take the partial trace over field variables and find that the reduced density matrix of the atomic system satisfies some integro - differential equation which can be simplified by employing the born approximation ( the interaction between the atoms and the field is so weak that there is no back reaction effect of the atoms on the field ) . under this approximation ,",
    "the evolution of the density matrix depends on the first- and second - order correlation functions of the field operators in the thermal equilibrium state at temperature @xmath3 .",
    "employing further the rotating - wave approximation in which we ignore all terms oscillating at higher frequencies and assuming that the correlation time of the photon reservoir is short ( the markov approximation ) , we arrive at the result that the influence of reservoir on the system of atoms can be described by dynamical semi - group @xcite with lindblad generator @xmath14+l_{{\\mathrm{d}}}$ ] , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 here @xmath17 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , @xmath18 is the frequency of the transition @xmath19 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath20 describes interatomic coupling by the dipole - dipole interaction . on the other hand , dissipative dynamics",
    "is given by the generator ( [ dyss ] ) with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean number of photons , and @xmath23 in the above equalities , @xmath24 is the single atom spontaneous emission rate , and @xmath25 is the collective damping constant . in the model considered , @xmath26 is the function of the interatomic distance @xmath27 , and @xmath26 is small for large separation of atoms . on the other hand , @xmath28 when @xmath27 is small .",
    "the master equation @xmath29 giving the time evolution of a density matrix of the system of two - level atoms can be used to obtain the equations for its matrix elements with respect to some basis . to simplify the calculations one can work in the basis of collective states in the hilbert space @xmath30 @xcite , given by product vectors @xmath31 symmetric superposition @xmath32 and antisymmetric superposition @xmath33 in the basis of collective states , two - atom system can be treated as a single four - level system with ground state @xmath34 , excited state @xmath35 and two intermediate states @xmath36 and @xmath0 . from ( [ me ] )",
    "it follows that the matrix elements of the state @xmath2 with respect to the basis @xmath37 satisfy the equations which can be grouped into decoupled systems of differential equations .",

    "we can put @xmath49 , so the state @xmath0 is completely decoupled from the photon reservoir .",
    "one can also check that the master equation ( [ me ] ) describes two types of time evolution of the atomic system , depending on the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath24 .",
