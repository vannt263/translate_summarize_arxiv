    "the conventional design of wireless networks is based on a centralized architecture where a base station , or an access point , directly exchanges data with the end users .",
    "thus , communication is essentially restricted to the one - to - many ( broadcast ) and many - to - one ( multiple - access ) _ single - hop _ paradigms . however , as the number of users and the data demand increase , and we move quickly towards the future of wireless networks , _ multi - hop _ and _ multi - flow _ paradigms are expected to play a very important role by enabling a denser spatial reuse of the spectrum and adaptation to heterogeneous scenarios characterized by user - deployed and user - operated infrastructures .",
    "a major challenge in multi - hop multi - flow wireless networks is that `` interference management '' and `` relaying '' are coupled with each other . in other words ,",
    "wireless relay nodes must play a dual role : they serve as intermediate steps for multi - hop communication and as part of the mechanism that allows interference management schemes .",
    "nonetheless , in the information theory literature , these two tasks have traditionally been addressed separately .",
    "the relaying problem is usually studied in the context of multi - hop single - flow wireless networks ( or relay networks ) . for such networks ,",
    "the capacity is shown in @xcite to be within a constant gap to the cut - set bound , and several relaying strategies are known to achieve the capacity to within a constant gap ( e.g. , quantize - map - forward @xcite , lattice quantization followed by map - and - forward @xcite and compress - and - forward @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of interference management is mostly studied in the context of multi - flow single - hop wireless network ( or interference channels ) .",
    "while the exact capacity and even a constant - gap capacity approximation for interference channels are still unknown ( except in the two - user case @xcite and some special @xmath0-user cases @xcite ) , the total degrees of freedom of such networks are known to be half of the cut - set bound and are achievable by interference alignment techniques @xcite .     wireless network .",
    "[ kkkfig],height=120 ]    as we move to the multi - hop multi - flow paradigm , a natural question is whether a decoupled approach for relaying and interference management is optimal . for example , if we consider a coarse metric such as degrees of freedom , do we need coupled strategies in order to perform optimally ? to make this question clear , consider the @xmath1 wireless network , shown in figure [ kkkfig ] .",
    "one approach that decouples relaying and interference management would basically consist of viewing the @xmath1 wireless network as the concatenation of two @xmath0-user interference channels . for the @xmath0-user interference channel , it is known that , for almost all values of channel gains , @xmath2 degrees of freedom are achievable both when the channel gains are fixed and when they are time - varying @xcite . therefore , by repeating the scheme described in @xcite at each hop , we can also achieve @xmath2 degrees of freedom on the @xmath1 wireless network for almost all values of the channel gains .",
    "another similar decoupled approach consists of viewing each hop of the @xmath1 wireless network as a @xmath0-user x - channel .",
    "this approach in fact achieves @xmath3 degrees of freedom @xcite , which is slightly better than @xmath2 .",
    "a strategy that couples relaying and interference management can be devised using the result from @xcite that shows that , in an @xmath4 wireless network , a linear scheme can neutralize the interference at all destinations as long as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is possible to achieve @xmath6 ( roughly @xmath7 ) degrees of freedom on the @xmath1 wireless network , by using only a subset of @xmath8 source - destination pairs . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ approaches ] , this coupled scheme only outperforms the interference channel and @xmath9-channel approaches for @xmath10 .",
    "another coupled strategy was recently proposed for the case @xmath11 in @xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme , named aligned interference neutralization , manages to achieve the cut - set bound of two degrees of freedom , and outperforms all decoupled approaches .",
    "however , in general , for @xmath12 , all known schemes fall short of the cut - set outer bound of @xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "this makes the @xmath1 wireless network a canonical example of a multi - unicast network where the gap between the state - of - the - art inner bounds and the outer bounds is very significant , and an important step in understanding how suboptimal decoupled approaches can be in general .     wireless network .",
    "[ approaches],height=226 ]    in this work , we introduce a new achievability scheme called _ aligned network diagonalization _ ( and ) , which handles relaying and interference management in a coupled manner , and manages to close the gap between inner and outer bounds . in particular , we show that the @xmath1 wireless network has @xmath0 degrees of freedom for time - varying channels and constant channels , in which case the result holds for almost all channel gain values .",
    "this result also implies that coupled strategies can significantly outperform a strategy that handles relaying and interference management separately .",
    "the scheme takes two forms , depending on whether the channels are fixed or time - varying . in the case of time - varying channels ,",
    "aligned network diagonalization is in fact a linear scheme . by viewing multiple network uses as generating a single vector use of the network",
    ", we can interpret and as a solution to a diagonalization problem : is it possible to choose linear transformations for the sources , relays and destinations such that the resulting end - to - end transformation is a diagonal transformation ( with non - zero diagonal elements ) ?",
    "our scheme shows that , with probability @xmath13 over the channel gain realizations , this diagonalization can indeed be obtained . this way , interference - free channels are effectively created between each source and its corresponding destination , allowing each user to achieve arbitrarily close to one degree of freedom , i.e.",
    ", each user can get `` the entire cake '' .",
    "similar to the aligned interference neutralization scheme in @xcite , each source starts by encoding its message into several data streams , each one corresponding to a direction in a vector space .",
    "the key idea behind and , which differentiates it from the scheme in @xcite , is in the goal of the operations performed by the relays .",
    "each relay receives data streams along several directions , and performs carefully chosen linear operations in order to modify each of these directions .",
    "in particular , the new directions are chosen so that _ it looks like the transfer matrix of the first hop is the inverse of the transfer matrix of the second hop_. this way , by forwarding these effectively received signals , the end - to - end transformation is diagonalized .    in the case of fixed channels , however , using the network multiple times",
    "does not provide us with the diversity we need to perform the end - to - end diagonalization .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve the same @xmath0 degrees of freedom in this setting , each of the data streams is transmitted along distinct _",
    "rational dimensions _ , using the real interference alignment framework from @xcite .",
    "then , similar ideas to those used in the time - varying case can be used in order to modify the rational dimensions at the relays so that the transfer matrix of the first hop looks like the inverse of the transfer matrix of the second hop .",
    "once again the result is that the signals transmitted at the sources essentially undergo a diagonal transformation until they reach the destinations .",
    "several interesting extensions of our main result are possible . in particular , for multi - hop layered networks with @xmath0 source - destination pairs ,",
    "if all hops are fully connected , the number of degrees of freedom is the minimum between @xmath0 and the minimum number of relays in a single layer . the case of mimo sources , relays and destinations",
    "is also addressed .",
    "interestingly , our result implies that , from the point of view of degrees of freedom , the multiple antennas in a single mimo relay can be equivalentely seen as separate relays , meaning that cooperation between relays in the same layer can not increase the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "* related work : *    recently , a number of works have focused their attention to networks with @xmath14 source - destination pairs ( two - unicast networks ) .",
    "for instance , the work in @xcite provides constant - gap approximations to the capacity of zz and zs networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the focus are @xmath15 wireless networks .",
    "the authors investigated how the common information between the two relays can be exploited in the second hop and proposed relaying strategies based on distributed mimo broadcast techniques . in @xcite , the authors also considered the @xmath15 wireless network under a degrees - of - freedom perspective . by introducing a new scheme called aligned interference neutralization , which applies ideas from interference alignment to a multi - hop scenario",
    ", they showed that these networks have two degrees of freedom both in the case of time - varying channels and in the case of fixed channels .",
    "general layered networks with two source - destination pairs were later considered in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "two new notions were introduced .",
    "the first one is the idea of network condensation , by which a network with an arbitrary number of layers is reduced to a network with at most four layers with the same degrees of freedom .",
    "the second is a graph theoretic characterization of when the interference in a network is _ manageable _ , i.e. , when all the interference can be simultaneously neutralized .",
    "this allowed the degrees of freedom of two - unicast layered networks with an arbitrary number of layers and arbitrary connectivity between adjacent layers to be completely characterized and shown to only attain the values @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors revisited the @xmath15 setting with constant channel gains but under the constraint that the relays have to performing linear operations .",
    "they showed that the optimal degrees of freedom in this case are @xmath17 and can be achieved by a time - varying linear scheme .    when an arbitrary number of source - destination pairs @xmath0 is considered , the results are scarcer .",
    "one effort along this direction is found in @xcite , where the authors focus on two - hop networks structured as @xmath1 wireless networks where @xmath0 is very large ( and edge effects can be neglected ) and investigate communication strategies based on rate - splitting and successive interference cancellation at each hop . in @xcite , networks with @xmath0 source - destination pairs and @xmath0 hops with @xmath0 nodes each were considered under the fast fading scenario .",
    "the authors show that , under some assumptions on the joint distribution of the channel gains , @xmath0 degrees of freedom can be achieved .",
    "the main idea is to have the relays forward their received signals at carefully chosen times , so that the signals transmitted by the sources undergo an approximately diagonal end - to - end transformation .",
    "the @xmath1 wireless network is made up of @xmath0 sources @xmath18 , @xmath0 relays @xmath19 , and @xmath0 destinations @xmath20 , organized as a two - hop layered network , as shown in figure [ kkkfig ] .",

    "suppose we have a two - hop network with @xmath0 sources , @xmath0 destinations , and a single mimo relay with @xmath0 ( full - duplex ) antennas .",
    "equivalently , this setup , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mimo ] , can be seen as our @xmath1 wireless network where the @xmath0 relay nodes are allowed to collaborate in the computation of their transmit signals .",
    "this new problem is clearly easier than our original problem , in the sense that any scheme for the @xmath1 wireless network can be used to achieve the same rates on the network with a single mimo relay node .        achieving @xmath0 degrees of freedom in the setting from fig .",
    "[ mimo ] is not difficult . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mimo2 ] , a simple scalar linear scheme can be used to _ diagonalize _ the network .",
    "more precisely , if each source @xmath21 transmits a signal @xmath86 $ ] at time @xmath23 , @xmath44 , the received signal at the mimo relay at time @xmath23 is a length-@xmath0 vector @xmath87 = ( y_{v_{1}}[t], ... ,y_{v_{k}}[t])^{\\dagger}$ ] given by @xmath87 = h_{s , v } \\vec x_s[t ]   + \\vec z[t]$ ] , where @xmath88 = ( x_{s_1}[t], ... ,x_{s_k}[t])^{\\dagger}$ ] . then , if we assume that the transfer matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 are invertible ( which is the case with probability @xmath13 under the distribution assumptions in section [ setupsec ] ) , the relay can build its transmit signal for time @xmath91 through the linear transformation @xmath92 = h_{v , d}^{-1 } h_{s , d}^{-1 } \\vec y_{v}[t]$ ] .",
    "if we let @xmath93 = ( y_{d_{1}}[t], ... ,y_{d_{k}}[t])^{\\dagger}$ ] be the vector of the received signals at the destinations , it is clear that @xmath94 = \\vec x_{s}[t ] + \\vec { \\tilde z}[t+1]$ ] , where @xmath95 $ ] is the vector of effective noises at the destinations .",
    "therefore , each destination receives its desired source signal plus a gaussian noise term , meaning that the relay operations essentially diagonalized the end - to - end transfer matrix of the network , since @xmath94 \\approx i \\vec x_{s}[t]$ ] , where @xmath96 is the identity matrix .",
    "it is easy to see that a slight modification of this scheme can guarantee that the transmit power constraints are satisfied at the relays and can thus be used to show that @xmath0 degrees of freedom are achievable in this setup .",
    "when we move back to our original problem with @xmath0 single - antenna relay nodes , we notice that the same scheme can not be implemented because the relays are not allowed to cooperate in order to compute @xmath97 = h_{v , d}^{-1 } h_{s , d}^{-1 } \\vec y_{v}[t]$ ] .",
    "therefore , a natural question is whether it possible to apply the linear transformation @xmath98 _ distributedly_. more precisely , can we find functions @xmath99 such that @xmath100 for all @xmath101 ? in the case of general transfer matrices @xmath90 and @xmath102 , the answer is no .",
    "in fact , if @xmath98 is not diagonal , it is easy to see that at least one component of @xmath103 depends on multiple components of @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , in order to pursue our objective of diagonalizing the network with distributed relays , we must consider a more general question than the aforementioned one .",
    "in particular , we will reformulate the question of whether the network can be diagonalized by bringing in the channels time variation , and by including linear transformations at each source and at each destination .",

    "therefore , in this section , instead of focusing on the sum degrees of freedom , we will instead consider the degrees - of - freedom region .",

    "once again , the converse part of this theorem is obtained from the cut - set bound in a straigthforward manner . moreover ,",

    "more precisely , for any degrees - of - freedom tuple @xmath359 satisfying ( [ thm3a ] ) , we first discard @xmath362 out of the total relay antennas .",
    "moreover , since @xmath363 $ ] from ( [ thm3b ] ) , we can discard @xmath364 out of the source antennas and @xmath365 out of the destination antennas . then , if we view all remaining antennas as separate nodes , we obtain a @xmath366 wireless network with time - varying channels , where @xmath367 .",
    "it is then clear that , by applying theorem [ thmtv ] , we can achieve @xmath368 sum degrees of freedom on this network , which corresponds to the degrees - of - freedom tuple @xmath359 in the original network .",
    "the most interesting aspect of this result is the fact that the cooperation that is allowed among the antennas due to the mimo setting does not improve the degrees of freedom that can be achieved in the case that all the antennas are viewed as separate nodes .",
    "notice , however , that this cooperation among antennas may have the power to simplify the schemes we presented in sections [ descriptiontv ] and [ descriptionc ] .",
    "in this work , we showed that , @xmath1 wireless networks have @xmath0 degrees of freedom both in the case of time - varying channel coefficients and in the case of constant channel coefficients ( in which case the result holds for almost all values of constant channel coefficients ) .",
    "this result is surprising due to the fact that , in a @xmath1 wireless network , each destination is subject to interference originated at @xmath369 sources .",
    "thus , the total number of interference signals that need to be neutralized for @xmath0 degrees of freedom to be achieved is @xmath370 , while the number of variables under our control ( i.e. , the encoding rules at the sources and the relaying operations ) is only @xmath371 .",
    "moreover , this result answers the important conceptual question of whether global interference management can significantly outperform hop - by - hop interference management .",
    "as we showed , global interference management techniques have the potential to effectively remove all the interference experienced by the destinations in two - hop wireless networks .",
    "the same objective can not be achieved if we restrict ourselves to hop - by - hop interference management .",
    "our main result is proven through the introduction of a new coding strategy , which we call aligned network diagonalization . in the case of time - varying channels in particular ,",
    "the scheme can be seen as providing an affirmative answer to a linear diagonalization question : is it possible to apply linear transformations at the sources , relays and destinations , so that the overall linear tranformation of the network is diagonal ?",
    "the main idea of the scheme lies in the operations performed by the relays .",
    "these operations can be understood as modifying the received signals at the relays so that it `` looks like '' the transfer matrix of the first hop is the inverse of the transfer matrix of the second hop .",
    "this way , we can effectively diagonalize the network , creating parallel interference - free channels from each source to its corresponding destination .",
    "these interference - free channels allow each source - destination pair to achieve arbitrarily close to one degree of freedom .    while our results imply the tightness of the cut - set bound , it is important to point out that this is likely to be the case only for degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , this occurs for the two - user interference channel , where the degrees - of - freedom cut - set bound of @xmath13 is trivially tight , but , as shown in @xcite , tighter outer bounds can be obtained through genie - aided arguments and by considering distinct interference regimes .",
    "thus , one would expect that more sophisticated outer bounds can be developed for @xmath1 wireless network as well . in this sense ,",
    "a promising direction is to consider a deterministic model of the @xmath1 wireless network .",
    "deterministic models of wireless networks have been proven useful in the study of the capacity of both multi - hop single - flow networks @xcite and single - hop multi - flow networks @xcite .",
    "not only do they usually provide new insights about the original stochastic problem , but they can in fact be shown , in several cases , to approximate well the capacity of their non - deterministic ( usually awgn ) counterparts .",
    "a step towards studying @xmath1 wireless networks under deterministic models was taken in @xcite . by using the worst - case noise result from @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the capacity region of an awgn @xmath1 wireless network is a subset of the capacity region of the same network under the truncated deterministic model @xcite ( where nodes are given slightly more power ) .",
    "this fact is particularly interesting because it allows us to look for outer bounds on the capacity region of the awgn @xmath1 wireless network by focusing on the truncated deterministic channel model , which is expected to reveal combinatorial structures of the problem that are not apparent in the awgn setting .",
    "other directions for future work include a study of the time expansion required for our proposed scheme to be performed .",
    "in particular , we notice that the linear version of and relies on the fast variation of the channel gains in the network and requires a large number of distinct channel realization in order to achieve close to one degree of freedom per user .",
    "if we limit the available time ( and space ) diversity , as considered for instance in @xcite , it is not clear if the same gains achieved by and can be obtained . of particular interest is the tradeoff between achievable degrees of freedom and the amount of channel diversity available .",
    "furthermore , one would expect this tradeoff to be strongly affected by the addition of extra relays to the network .",
    "thus we would like to know if and can be generalized to take advantage of a larger number of relays , which can provide more spatial diversity , in order to reduce its requirement for time diversity .",
