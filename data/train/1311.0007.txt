    "transport in quantum wires is a rich field bringing together conductivity experiments @xcite and luttinger liquid theory which describes the crucial electron - electron interaction effects in one dimension.@xcite scattering from a single impurity or other inhomogeneities , for example , becomes renormalized by the interaction and can lead to insulating behavior at low temperatures even for weak impurities.@xcite    in order to determine the conductivity of a one - dimensional wire it is necessary to couple it to some leads or reservoirs , normally a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "such a set up can be most readily described as an inhomogeneous wire , in which the 2degs are modeled as non - interacting wires . in this case",
    "the conductance is usually controlled by the parameters of the lead rather than of the wire,@xcite in contrast to what a naive calculation on an _ infinite _ interacting wire would suggest .",
    "the conductance for perfect adiabatic contacts and wires can be understood by the decomposition of an electron into fractional charges.@xcite additional relaxation processes which take place within the interacting region of the wire do , however , lead to a resistance which is affected by the wire parameters .",
    "the resistance due to impurity scattering @xcite or phonon scattering @xcite within the interacting wire , for example , will in general depend both on the luttinger liquid parameter of the leads and the wire .",
    "in this paper we consider the intrinsic scattering from the junctions between the wire and leads , which is generically present due to the abrupt change of parameters even for otherwise perfect ballistic connections .",
    "this scattering is renormalized by the interaction,@xcite leading to a vanishing dc conductance in the low temperature limit for repulsive interactions within the wire . however , perfect conductance is still possible by tuning the parameters on the two sides of the junctions as has been analyzed in detail for a particle - hole symmetric model.@xcite in this case a line of conducting fixed points in parameter space exists as only one relevant backscattering operator is permitted by symmetry which can always be tuned to zero .",
    "here we generalize to the more experimentally relevant case where particle - hole symmetry is no longer present . even in this more general case",
    "we still find a line of conducting fixed points provided the underlying microscopic theory has certain local symmetry properties . even though the systems under consideration are inhomogeneous , it is possible to characterize the fixed points by a single conformally invariant boundary theory with a characteristic mode expansion and finite size spectrum .",
    "the results are confirmed by numerical quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations on spinless fermions .",
    "characteristic experimental signatures for the local density of states near junctions can be predicted .    for conductivity experiments we must typically consider a system with two junctions , one at each end of an interacting wire where it is connected to the leads ( e.g.  2degs ) .",
    "these junctions are intrinsic sources of inhomogeneity , but in most cases the junctions do not influence each other since the length of the wire is much larger than the coherence length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the inverse temperature and @xmath2 the velocity of the collective excitations . for our purpose to make predictions for the backscattering and the local behavior near the leads , it is therefore sufficient to analyze one junction between a lead and a wire .    as an introduction in sec .",

    "this implies a non - negligible mixing of low energy states with high energy ones due to scattering near the interface .",
    "however , in certain limits , a narrow band theory can be used , in which we keep only a narrow band of states , of width @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fermi momentum , and linearize the dispersion relation .",

    "these are the limits of weak backscattering or weak tunneling . starting with the unperturbed basis of translationally invariant wave - functions , or wave - functions vanishing at the interface respectively , a small perturbation only mixes states with energy differences of order of magnitude of the perturbation .    in these cases",
    "we may keep only a narrow band of states near zero energy and introduce left and right moving fields in the usual way , @xmath42 with @xmath43 a continuous variable and @xmath44 being the fermi momentum in the left , @xmath45 , or right , @xmath46 , of the wire .    here",
    "we want to consider only the simplest model for a junction while various other types of junctions are discussed in appendix [ app_nonint ] . in the simplest model",
    "two homogeneous regions are connected at one site such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 is kept as a free parameter .",
    "the reflection amplitude is determined by the schrdinger equation for the central site and results in @xmath49 the conditions for perfect transmission are therefore @xmath50 when these conditions are satisfied , @xmath26 and @xmath51 .",
    "curiously , the maximum possible value of @xmath27 actually occurs when @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in which case @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "but in this case the current is actually zero on both sides , so calling this perfect transmission would seem inappropriate .",
