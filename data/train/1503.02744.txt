    "@xcite the bands at the fermi level are all derived from ir _ 5d_-orbitals .",
    "thus the pyrochlore arrangement of the ir lattice , which determines the energy and dispersion of the bands from the ir , has a significant effect on the electrons that become superconducting in cair@xmath0 .",

    "@xcite the partial dos shows that the total dos is dominated by the contributions from the ir sublattice and that the contribution from the ca atoms near the fermi level is almost negligible .",

    "the magnitude of the splitting is roughly 0.3 ev in both cases .",
    "the value of the dos at e@xmath68 ( soc included ) is comparable with the value estimated from the heat capacity data .",
    "many bands are found in cair@xmath0 through the fermi energy , and therefore the calculated fermi surface is complex .",
    "the fermi surface is very strongly affected by the presence of the spin orbit coupling inherent to the 5__d _ _ element ir , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) . given the radical change in the fermi surface due to the spin orbit coupling compared to the hypothetical case where no spin orbit coupling is present , one can speculate that cair@xmath0 has t@xmath5 on the high side of the ir - based compounds due to the presence of the soc .",
    "when the laves phase structure contains _ f_-electrons then it seems to influence the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "to understand this picture we have compared the electronic band structure of the strongly coupled superconductor ceru@xmath0 ,  @xcite with the cair@xmath0 electronic band structure .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the electronic structure of ceru@xmath0 is quite different from the cair@xmath0 band structure . in ceru@xmath0 , there are empty ce-_f_-states just above the fermi level , while some of the _ f_-states are dispersed and hybridize mainly with ru _ d_-states .",
    "in contrast , there is not much ca - ir hybridization observed in the _ s - d_-bands in cair@xmath0 .",
    "considering the band structure and the derived parameters for ceru@xmath0 , it appears that one of the major effects of the hybridization of ce _ f - d _ and ce _ f _ with ru _ d _ bands is to enhance the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this shows laves phases are favorable for superconductivity from an electron - phonon perspective ; however , in addition , the electronic band structures play an important role .    in oxide based ir pyrochlores",
    ", the pyrochlore lattice causes magnetic frustration and complex behavior .",
    "@xcite in the case of intermetallic cair@xmath74 the bands are not localized and no magnetism is observed . the compound becomes superconducting , however , which might be linked to the special geometry of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "superconductivity can be often found close to instabilities , as for example van hove singularities in the band structure.@xcite in our case we see a peak in the density of states at the fermi level which indicates the proximity of an instability .",
    "this could indicate that the pyrochlore lattice might be advantageous for finding superconductors .",
    "we have characterized the properties of the pyrochlore lattice superconductor cair@xmath0 .",
    "the presence of a bulk superconducting transition with @xmath1  k was confirmed , and the properties of the superconductor were elucidated through magnetization and heat capacity measurements .",
    "the inferred electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath58 and @xmath46 show that cair@xmath0 is a weakly coupled bcs - type superconductor .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations indicate that the the ir _ d _ states are dominant through the fermi level . given the profound effect of spin - orbit coupling on the calculated electronic structure",
    ", it can be argued that the value of @xmath22 , and possibly even the existence of superconductivity at all , is due to the heavy element character imparted to this material by the ir pyrochlore lattice .",
