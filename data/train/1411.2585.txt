    "a ring laser ( rl ) gyroscope is composed by a square or triangular optical cavity inside which two opposite light beams propagate in a closed loop . in a reference frame rotating at velocity @xmath1 with respect to an inertial frame ,",
    "the opposite directions are not equivalent ; the two laser emission frequencies are then splitted by the sagnac frequency @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the oriented scale factor , @xmath5 is the vectorial area enclosed by the laser beams , @xmath6 is the optical wavelength and @xmath7 the length of the round - trip path",
    ". the frequency difference can be measured by observing the beat note between the two counter - propagating beams .",
    "the fundamental limit to the angular velocity resolution of a rl is given by the photon shot - noise .",
    "the power spectral density of shot noise , converted in equivalent rotational noise and expressed in unit of @xmath8 , reads @xcite    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the quality factor of the optical cavity , @xmath11 the planck constant , @xmath12 the optical power detected by photodiode , @xmath13 the measuring time , @xmath14 the speed of light , and @xmath15 the light frequency .",
    "significant advancements in rl sensitivity have recently driven new applications concerning geophysics , geodesy and test of general relativity @xcite .",
    "a present challenge of this research is the observation of the relativistic lense - thirring effect , a perturbation of few parts in @xmath16 to the earth rotation rate .",
    "such a measurement requires a calibration of the rl with respect to the local spacetime , in order to measure the earth rotation with high accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , the time dependent fluctuation of scale factor , backscattering and laser dynamics induced non - reciprocal effects have to be controlled in order to fully exploit the rl sensitivity up to the shot noise level in equation  [ eq : shotnoise ] . in recent papers",
    "@xcite we addressed the role of laser dynamics on the stability and accuracy of a ring laser used as rotation sensor ; in this work we focus on the role of cavity deformations on @xmath17 and @xmath7 .",
    "the design of the cavity is crucial for the stability of the geometrical scale factor @xmath18 .",
    "the most stable and sensitive rotation sensor at present , the gross ring g ( wettzell , bavaria ) @xcite , has an optical cavity with a side length of 4 m , and has been constructed on a rigid frame made of @xmath19 . in this case the geometrical stability is obtained by fixing the mirrors to a very rigid and heavy structure , and by minimizing thermal expansions and pressure variations .",
    "this experimental set - up has shown that ring lasers have the potentiality to measure the lense - thirring effect on an earth based experiment , but the monolithic design can not be extended to a triaxial array of ring laser with sides of @xmath20 @xmath21 , as required by the ginger project @xcite .",
    "an heterolithic design must be considered : the cavity frame can be made of more standard materials with thermal expansion coefficients at the level of several ppm / k , and the mirror positions must be actively controlled in order to compensate the frame deformations by implementing a suitable system to measure the mirror distances based on ultra - stable optical frequency references .",
    "a detailed study of the effects of geometrical distortions on the optical path is the first necessary step toward the active control of mirror positions . in the literature",
    ", one can find many papers about the geometry of a ring cavity @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adress for the first time the problem to find a suitable approach to minimize the scale factor @xmath22 variations , and pose the basis for the control of an heterolithic ring laser cavity .",
    "our study is based on fermat s principle to model the optical cavity geometry starting from the position of the center of curvature of the mirrors .",
    "we demonstrate that in a square cavity the control of the length of the two diagonals plays an important role .",
    "in fact , if the two rl diagonals are locked to the same absolute length , the optical cavity length has a stationary point corresponding to the regular square cavity , with two important implications for the control of an heterolithic structure : i ) one can implement a procedure to approach the regular geometry ; ii ) in this case , the residual deformations contribute with quadratic terms depending on the ratio between the cavity side - length and the mirrors radius of curvature . + the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",

    "this allows us to identify the rigid body motion of the cavity and then to classify the residual optical cavity deformations @xmath97 .",
    "we demonstrated that when the configuration of the mirrors is close to that of the regular square cavity , the scale factor and the perimeter length of a rl depend linearly only on the cavity isotropic expansion @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that , once the diagonal lengths are set to the same value , the effects of the remaining deformations on the rl scale factor are quadratic in their amplitudes @xmath116 .",
    "this observation is at the basis of a possible saddle - point optimization of the different deformations @xmath97 ; keeping the mirror positions within few @xmath157 m , the stability of @xmath152 part in @xmath16 in the rl scale factor @xmath158 can be obtained .",
