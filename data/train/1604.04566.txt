    "it is believed that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are generated from either the collapse of massive stars @xcite or the merger of neutron stars ( nss ) @xcite , during which collimated relativistic outflows can be launched . as the outflow propagates into the circum - burst medium ,",
    "a relativistic blast wave will develop , whose dynamic evolution can be well described by the blandford - mckee solution @xcite .",
    "the blast wave would sweep - up and accelerate the circum - burst electrons and generate afterglows at frequencies ranging from x - rays to radio waves @xcite .",
    "this is the basic picture for grb afterglows . in the pre-_swift",
    "_ era , many afterglow lightcurves showed a smooth power - law decay , which can be explained by the synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by the forward shock ( fs ) . for a complete reference of the analytical synchrotron external shock afterglow models",
    ", one can see @xcite .",
    "however , many unexpected features in the afterglows were later observed thanks to the _ swift _ satellite @xcite and other optical telescopes ( e.g. , grond telescope , see @xcite ) .    early flares and shallow decay phase ( or the so called x - ray plateau ) are common in the x - ray afterglow data @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the central engines of grbs are still active after the burst , giving us a useful clue to investigate the central engines .",
    "on the other hand , some optical afterglows show re - brightenings at late stages in the observer frame ( @xmath0 s ) . in some cases ,",
    "bumps in x - rays are accompanied by optical re - brightenings ( e.g. , grb 120326a , @xcite ) , while in other cases , no clear counterpart features are observed in optical ( e.g. , grb 100814a , @xcite ) .",
    "both the x - ray plateaus and the optical re - brightenings can not be explained in the framework of a simple fs scenario .",
    "thus researchers have proposed several refined models to interpret these unexpected features in recent years ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "stimulated by these refined models , it is urgent to answer whether x - ray plateaus and optical re - brightenings have a natural origin or they are special outcomes varying in different grbs .",
    "normally , the energy released during the x - ray plateau is several percent of the prompt emission @xcite , which motivates researchers to favour the scenarios involving energy injection processes . according to the composition of the injected late outflow , there are generally three types of energy injection processes , i.e. , the pure poynting - flux injections @xcite , the collision of kinetic - energy dominated shells @xcite , and the injection of the electron - positron - pair winds ( @xmath1 winds @xcite ) . if one further considers the optical re - brightenings , some other scenarios are called for , including the circum - burst density jumps @xcite , two - component jets @xcite , and varying microphysical parameters @xcite .",
    "all these models have succeeded to some extent in explaining one or several afterglows according to previous studies . on the other hand ,",
    "most researchers believe that the central engines of grbs are either black holes ( bhs ) or magnetars . therefore , it may be reasonable to deduce that some specific groups of afterglows should have common features , and these features are associated with the physics of the central engines .    according to previous researches ,",
    "late activities of bhs may be sustained by the accretion of fall - back material that fails to escape from the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the energy injection is expected to be delayed by the fall - back time @xmath2 .",
    "if the fs is affected by such a delayed energy injection , the shock dynamics should rapidly evolve from a non - injection phase to an injection - dominated phase @xcite . as a result , afterglows with steep optical re - brightenings ( with the time scale of the re - brightening @xmath3 ) are generated .",
    "we thus proposed that steep optical re - brightenings are caused by the fall - back processes of central accreting bhs .",
    "by contrast , the energy flow from a magnetar may be in the form of a continuous @xmath1 wind @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 wind model was initially proposed to explain the x - ray plateau @xcite .",
    "the end time of the plateau phase is roughly the typical spin - down timescale ( @xmath4 ) of the newly born magnetar . for the broad and shallow optical re - brightening",
    ", its peak time also coincides with @xmath4 , which motivates us to believe that the @xmath1 wind model should work for afterglows with both a shallow optical re - brightening and an accompanied x - ray feature .",
    "we have developed a semi - analytic method to solve the dynamic of a system including a fs and a reverse shock ( rs ) .",
    "it can be applied in different situations such as when a density jump medium or the @xmath1 wind is involved . in this review ,",
    "we briefly describe our related studies in recent years , and show how the investigations help to shed light on the nature of grbs . in section 2 , we revisit the circum - burst density jump scenario , and compare our results with previous hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . the delayed energy injection model is discussed in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we show the @xmath1 wind model would naturally produce the optical re - brightenings and some characteristics of the central magnetar may be derived by comparing the theoretical results with observations .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "after the prompt emission of grb , a fs will form and propagate into the circum - burst medium . the dynamic of the fs can be described by a set of differential equations proposed by @xcite . assuming the number density profile of the circum - burst medium is a step function of radius @xmath5 : @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 is the transition radius and @xmath11 . before the fs reaching @xmath10 ,",
    "the evolution of the lorentz factor of the fs ( @xmath12 ) is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the initial mass of the outflow , @xmath15 is the mass of the ambient medium swept - up by the fs , @xmath16 is the radiation efficiency of the shocked material .",
    "the subscript `` 2 '' is used to mark quantities in the shocked region .",
    "when the fs encounters the density jump at @xmath10 , a rs will form and propagate back into the hot shell @xcite .",
    "these two shocks ( fs and rs ) and the contact discontinuity will separate the system into four regions : ( 1 ) unshocked high - density medium , ( 2 ) forward - shocked high - density medium , ( 3 ) reverse - shocked hot shell , and ( 4 ) unshocked hot shell . in this paper ,",
    "quantities in region `` @xmath17 '' are denoted by subscripts `` @xmath17 '' .",
    "we extend the derivation of @xcite to include the role of the reverse shock .",
    "firstly , it is assumed that the lorentz factor of region 2 ( @xmath12 ) and region 3 ( @xmath18 ) are equal , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "secondly , we can calculate the energy of each region @xmath20 , and the total energy @xmath21 . for the mass increment of region 3 , @xmath22 ,",
    "the radiative energy of the fs - rs system is @xmath23 . by equating @xmath24 with @xmath23 and using some additional equations ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the relative lorentz factor ( velocity ) of region 4 as measured in the rest frame of region 2 , @xmath28 is the velocity of region 4 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are functions of other variables ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath33 could be finally derived with some other equations involving @xmath15 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath5 .    here",
    ", we briefly describe how the flux densities are calculated after solving equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "customarily , the energy distribution function , @xmath36 , of the shocked electrons is taken as the two - segment power - law form @xcite , with the indices of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hereinafter , we use prime  ( @xmath39 ) on variables to denote quantities in the shock comoving frame and characters without a prime to denote quantities in the observer frame .",
    "synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) radiation are then considered to calculate the emission from electrons .",
    "basic formulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , the observed flux densities are obtained by integrating emission from electrons on the equal arrival time surface @xcite .    according to some previous studies @xcite",
    ", the optical re - brightening is attributed to the radiation from region 3 .",
    "however , results from our refined calculations are different . in our work",
    ", we find the magnitude of the emission from region 3 is mainly determined by two factors .",
    "one is the thermal lorentz factor of baryons in region 3 , i.e , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the other factor is the number density of electrons in region 3 , @xmath42 .",
    "we set the initial values of the outflow parameters as : the isotropic kinetic energy @xmath43 erg , the initial lorentz factor @xmath44 , @xmath45  @xmath46 , @xmath47 cm , and the redshift @xmath48 . in figure 1 , we calculate two cases with different density jump ratios ( @xmath49 ) , of 10 and 100 times , respectively",
    ". results from our semi - analytic method show that @xmath40 given by the analytical solution is overestimated ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , we use the co - moving volume of region 3 to calculate the volume - averaged @xmath42 , which is significantly lower than that predicted by the shock jump conditions ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the radiation from region 3 is actually lower than that given by previous analytical studies .",
    "figure 2 shows the corresponding lightcurves in two cases .",
    "no notable bumps emerge after the density jump in these cases . this is consistent with the results from several hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "typical values are adopted for parameters of the plasma in all regions @xcite , i.e. , the equipartition parameter for electron energy @xmath50 , the equipartition parameter for magnetic field energy @xmath51 , the electron distribution index @xmath52 , and the half - opening angle @xmath53 .     before encountering the density jump and @xmath35 during the encountering , both denoted by @xmath35 .",

    "the horizontal dashed lines mark the values of corresponding lorentz factors ( which remain constant during the reverse shock crossing time ) given by @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath35 ( see the green solid lines ) during the encounter is almost constant ( slowly increasing due to adiabatic expansion ) , which is shown as a `` plateau '' that is significantly shorter than that of @xmath12 .",
    "the shortness of the `` plateau '' of @xmath35 is due to the different transformation formula between the burst frame time and the apparent time in the observer frame . ]",
    "hz ) and the x - ray band ( 0.3 kev ) , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines ( opt-4 or xray-4 ) represent the flux density of region 2 before the density jump and the flux density of region 4 after the jump .",
    "the dashed lines ( opt-3 or xray-3 ) are the contribution from region 3 after the density jump .",
    "the dash - dotted lines ( opt-2 or xray-2 ) mark the flux density of region 2 after the jump .",
    "total flux densities of all the components are presented by the solid lines ( opt - tot or xray - tot ) . for a similar plot ,",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "we now focus on the afterglows with steep optical re - brightenings .",
    "we show the steep optical re - brightening can be naturally generated in the delayed energy injection scenario . in this model , the central engine after burst is assumed to be a bh .",
    "considering the vicinity along the spin axis of the bh at late times should be clean , we can assume the energy flow is in type of poynting - flux .",
    "the delayed poynting - flux would be absorbed by the hot plasma behind the fs and modify the dynamics of the fs .",
    "if the luminosity of the poynting - flux is @xmath55 , then the dynamic of the fs can be described by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bulk lorentz factor of the fs , @xmath58 is the beaming factor of the grb outflow , @xmath59 is the swept - up mass by the shock , @xmath60 is the radiative efficiency , @xmath5 is the radius of the fs and @xmath61 is the time from the event measured in the burster frame .",
    "such a delayed energy injection would lead to a rapid change in the evolution of @xmath62 according to equation ( 3 ) , consequently the flux would show a steep rise .    the energy injection power ( with a luminosity of @xmath55 ) during the fall - back accretion may come from some magnetic processes @xcite , however , its exact temporal profile is still uncertain .",
    "here , we use two possible modes in our calculations .",
    "one is the top - hat mode in which the injected power @xmath55 is a constant from a start time @xmath63 to an end time @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the other is the broken - power - law mode , in which the luminosity profile is similar to the profile of the mass accretion rate during the fall - back @xcite , i.e. , @xmath65^{-1/s},\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the peak luminosity at the peak time @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are the rising and decreasing index respectively , @xmath70 is the sharpness of the peak . in figure 3",
    ", we show lightcurves calculated in the two modes , from which we find the steep optical re - brightening would be generated .",
    "the initial conditions of the outflow and the key parameters involved in the radiation process are the same as those in section 2 .    this model has been used to interpret the steep re - brightenings in the lightcurves of grb 081029 @xcite and grb 100621a @xcite .",
    "we notice that @xmath71 is just equal to @xmath2 , which gives @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fall - back radius , @xmath74 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath75 is the mass of central bh .",
    "moreover , the injected energy should come from the potential energy of the fall - back material , i.e. , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total fall - back mass , @xmath78 is the efficiency of the energy conversion . in the top - hat mode , equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) will give @xmath79 therefore , in principle , @xmath77 can be inferred from the fitting to the optical re - brightenings in the scenario .",

    "similar plots can be found at @xcite . ]",
    "in the prior section , we interpret the steep optical re - brightenings by using the delayed energy injection model . now , we discuss another group of afterglows , of which the optical re - brightenings are shallower .    after a grb , the remaining object of the progenitor may be a magnetar , which will lose its rotational energy by ejecting a continuous poynting - flux . in the @xmath1 wind model",
    ", the poynting - flux may convert into an @xmath1 wind , as hinted from phenomena associated with pulsar wind nebulae @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath1 wind catches up with the fs , a long - lasting rs will form and propagate back into the @xmath1 wind .",
    "the rs - shocked @xmath1 will act as another emitting source besides the electrons shocked by the fs .",
    "consequently , the afterglow lightcurves are the combination of two components .",
    "this model has been proposed to interpret the x - ray plateau previously .",
    "however , we find this model may account for the common origin for shallow optical re - brightenings around @xmath88 s.    for a newly born magnetar , its poynting - flux luminosity @xmath89 is @xcite @xmath90 and its spin - down timescale is @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , are the surface magnetic field strength , radius , spin period , and moment of inertia of the magnetar respectively . the convention @xmath96 in cgs units",
    "is adopted hereafter .",
    "we assume the poynting - flux be converted into @xmath1 pairs , then the particle density in the comoving frame of the unshocked wind is @xmath97 , where @xmath35 is the bulk lorentz factor of the unshocked wind ( referred to as region 4 below ) . unlike the rapid evolution of @xmath12 in the delayed energy injection scenario ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath12 is shallow due to the smoothly evolving @xmath98 here .",
    "the dynamics of the fs - rs system here can be solved by applying the method mentioned in section 2 . meanwhile ,",
    "another method , called the mechanical method @xcite , was also proposed to solve the dynamics of such fs - rs system . here , we first compare these two methods .",
    "let s consider an outflow with an isotropic kinetic energy of @xmath99 erg and an initial lorentz factor of @xmath100 , and we set @xmath101  @xmath46 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 g. the evolution of @xmath12 can thus be obtained by using the two methods respectively . in figure 4 , we see the results from our method and the mechanical method are consistent with each other .",
    "below , we adopt the mechanical method to solve the dynamics of the fs - rs system .    after taking the following parameters : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , the corresponding lightcurves can be calculated ( see figure 5 ) . in this case",
    ", it is clearly shown that the flux from the rs begins to exceed that from the fs at @xmath110  s , leading to the emergence of the optical re - brightening and the x - ray plateau simultaneously .",
    "due to the effect of the equal arrival time surface @xcite , the peak time of the optical re - brightening would be delayed , i.e. , larger than @xmath4",
    ". however , this kind of delay in x - rays can be ignored . as a result ,",
    "optical re - brightenings are relatively easier to emerge than `` x - ray re - brightenings '' . in other words",
    ", it is often the case that only a x - ray plateau or no equivalent feature in x - rays accompanies the optical re - brightening .",
    "this property in our model is interestingly consistent with many observations . in figure 6",
    ", optical afterglows are calculated using different values of @xmath92 . from these results , it is found that the flux from the long - lasting rs would account for the shallow optical re - brightening .",
    "the @xmath1 wind model has been applied @xcite to explain the afterglows of grb 080413b @xcite , grb 090426 @xcite , grb 091029 @xcite , and grb 100814a @xcite .",
    "since the flux from the rs is sensitive to @xmath98 and @xmath4 , the @xmath1 wind scenario provides a useful way to probe the characteristics of newly - born magnetars .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath4 are uniquely determined by the parameter @xmath92 , we suggest that @xmath92 may be constrained from the fitting to the observed re - brightenings .     in the @xmath1 wind model @xcite .",
    "the initial parameter values are : @xmath99 erg , @xmath100 , @xmath111  @xmath46 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 g. the thick dashed orange line represents the bm solution ( schematic ) , i.e. , @xmath112 and the vertical dashed line denotes the position of @xmath4 . ]     hz and the x - ray band is taken as 0.310 kev .",
    "the red dashed vertical line marks the position of @xmath4 . ]    .",
    "all the parameters are the same as those in figure 5 , except for @xmath113 ( solid line ) , @xmath114 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath115 ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "in this review , we show that the density jump scenario could not account for many of the observed optical re - brightenings in grb afterglows . furthermore , we classify the observed afterglows with optical re - brightenings into two groups and investigate their intrinsic origin . the afterglows with steep optical re - brightenings are interpreted by the delayed energy injection model , which is associated with a central accreting bh",
    ". meanwhile , the afterglows with shallow optical re - brightenings are explained by the @xmath1 wind model , of which the central engine is a magnetar .",
    "although the above two groups of afterglows have similar origins for re - brightenings , some other factors will make the situation different .",
    "the observational data of some afterglows clearly show that their spectral indices are evolving @xcite .",
    "it is hard to satisfactorily model them only by using the simple models discussed here and/or other customary models . for the simple @xmath1 wind model or the two - component jet model , the spectral evolution would occur only when the characteristic frequencies are crossing the observational band , or when later component begins to dominate , but it can not work well for some special grbs . in such cases ,",
    "including some microphysical processes may be necessary to match the observations .",
    "for example , in the varying microphysical parameters scenarios @xcite , the varying electron distribution index @xmath116 would help to explain some unexpected spectral evolutions @xcite .",
    "varying microphysical parameters may be related to the acceleration performance of relativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "since the acceleration performance of shocks may depend on the magnetization ( or other factors ) of the plasma and the magnetization is highly variable @xcite , some special afterglows are foreseeable .",
    "it has been suggested that the two - component jets could also account for some shallow re - brightenings .",
    "the collapsar model of long - duration grbs offers a natural mechanism to generate two - component jets , i.e. , a high speed jet emerging from a star is accompanied by a relatively slow cocoon @xcite .",
    "the re - brightening lightcurve itself will not help to definitely discriminate the @xmath1 wind model from the two - component jet model , since the role of the wide jet is somehow similar to the role of the rs .",
    "however , there is another way that can help us in the future .",
    "a two - component jet should be associated with a collapsar . if the re - brightening is observed to be associated with the double ns merger ( by detections of the gravitational waves @xcite ) but not a collapsar , then the @xmath1 wind model would be preferred .",
    "the intrinsic origins of optical re - brightenings would help to probe the characteristics of central engines . in the delayed energy injection model ,",
    "@xmath2 can be derived from the start time of the re - brightening , and @xmath73 can thus be obtained .",
    "if the observational data is good enough , @xmath55 can be constrained in the fitting process , and we can estimate the total mass of the fall - back material .",
    "furthermore , the fall - back accretion theory requires that the steep optical re - brightening should be accompanied by a low energy supernova , in which the fall - back material can survive during the explosion .",
    "this model thus can be tested by future observations of grb - supernova association . in the @xmath1 wind model",
    ", @xmath4 can be roughly inferred from the peak time of the optical re - brightening . in general , an earlier re - brightening means that @xmath92 is larger or @xmath94 is smaller .",
    "so @xmath92 and @xmath94 can be constrained from observations .",
    "thus the @xmath1 model provides a potential way to probe the characteristics of the central magnetar .",
