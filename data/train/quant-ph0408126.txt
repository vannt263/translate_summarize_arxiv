    "quantum states of light with squeezed polarization have recently been in the focus of theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "the quantum analysis of the light polarization is generally based on four stokes parameters associated with four hermitian stokes operators @xcite . by definition , the quantum state of light with the level of quantum fluctuations of stokes operators smaller than the level corresponding to the coherent state",
    "is called polarization - squeezed ( ps ) state .",
    "its existence was predicted theoretically in @xcite and was revealed experimentally in a series of recent experiments @xcite .",
    "historically , the first experimental realization of a ps state of light implied the mixing of a strong orthogonally - polarized coherent beam with squeezed vacuum on a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) @xcite .",
    "the optical parametric amplification ( @xmath0 ) has also been successfully employed to generate the ps state of light @xcite . in the last decade the improvement of fiber optics techniques in the pulse field regime facilitated experiments directed to produce nonclassical solitons @xcite or highly stable zero - dispersion quadrature - squeezed ultrashort light pulses ( usps ) @xcite .",
    "recently it has been found experimentally that the simple spatial overlap of two orthogonally polarized quadrature - squeezed pulses leads to the formation of the ps light @xcite .",
    "the self - phase modulation ( spm ) effect , which is responsible for the quadrature squeezing of pulses in optical keer - like media ( @xmath1 ) , does not influence the photon statistics of pulses since the photon number is a constant of motion @xcite .",
    "it was noted for the first time in @xcite , that a consistent time - dependent quantum description of the spm effect must necessarily account for the additional noise related to nonlinear absorbtion ( the imaginary part of nonlinear susceptibility ) . in @xcite",
    "the kerr nonlinearity has been treated as a raman - like one , the quantum and thermal noises being considered as a fluctuating addition to the relaxation nonlinearity in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the addition is necessary in order to preserve the commutation relations among the pulse field - amplitude operators .",
    "hence , the resulting quantum equation of motion for the total field includes the hermitian - phase noise operator which describes the coupling of the field to a collection of localized , independent , medium oscillators . besides",
    ", the average value of the noise operator on the coherent state is considered to be zero .",
    "the time - delayed raman response of nonlinearity , which is around @xmath2 fs in fused - silica fibers , varies over frequencies of interest and is caused by back action of nonlinear nuclear vibrations on electronic ones .",
    "however , the contribution of raman oscillators to the kerr effect is secondary to the one of the electronic motion .",
    "indeed , if we deal with the nonlinear propagation of usps , for instance through fused - silica fibers , since the raman oscillators contribute with less than @xmath3 to the kerr effect , the contribution of the electronic motion on @xmath4 fs time scale is more than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the spm effect then has to focus on contribution of the electronic motion , especially in the case of usps with a duration much less than the time - delayed raman response or in case the pulse s frequencies are far from any raman resonances .",
    "an attempt to develop a quantum theory of the pulse spm primarily due to the electronic motion has been undertaken in @xcite , but the electronic nonlinearity has been modeled as a raman - like one . the electronic nonlinear response function in the frequency domain over the bandwidths of interest is considered constant and approximated with a delta function in the time domain .",
    "this implies an instantaneous electronic response of the kerr nonlinearity . in real situations",
    "the nonlinear response of electronic nonlinearity is finite .",
    "it results in a non - delta relaxation function in the proper analytical description of the kerr effect .",
    "such a consistent description based on the momentum operator , which is connected with the evolution of the field in space and incorporates the relaxation function of the electronic nonlinearity , has been implemented in @xcite , where the correlation functions and spectra of quadrature components of usps subjected to the spm effect in the electronic kerr medium are investigated . since the momentum operator is in the normally ordered form , in order to satisfy the commutation relations for time - dependent bose operators there is no need for additional fluctuating terms .",
    "the approach developed in @xcite for the spm effect has been extended in @xcite to the case of two usps undergoing , besides the spm effect , the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) effect .",
    "in this paper we apply the quantum theory of the spm and combined spm - xpm effects developed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to the case of spatial overlap and interference on a bs of quadrature - squeezed pulses .",
    "the nonclassical usps are obtained by undergoing the spm effect in an inertial electronic kerr medium .",
    "the finite relaxation time of the electronic kerr nonlinearity is accounted for and the dispersion of linear properties is described in the first approximation of the dispersion theory .",
    "we show that the approach for the spm effect based on the momentum operator allows an adequate calculation of correlation functions and fluctuation spectra of quantum stokes operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section1 ] the quantum model of spm effect for usps based on the momentum operator for the pulse field",
    "is exposed briefly .",
    "we present the space - evolution equation for time dependent bose operators , its solution , as well as some elements of the algebra of bose operators .",
    "section [ section2 ] introduces the quantum characterization of polarization of light in terms of stokes operators , as well as their correlation functions and spectra . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we analyze the overlap between a coherent usp and a quadrature - squeezed one , the latter usp being produced by employing the spm effect in an electronic isotropic kerr medium .",
    "the average values , the correlation functions of stokes operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 are computed , and the spectrum of @xmath6 is graphically represented .",
    "this analysis is continued in section [ section4 ] by investigating the spatial overlap of two independent quadrature - squeezed usps . in section [ section5 ]",
    "we study the overlap of two quadrature - squeezed pulses inside a nonlinear anisotropic kerr medium in the presence of the combined spm - xpm effect .",
    "the momentum operator for the xpm effect introduces the section .",
    "here we show that the xpm effect can be employed to control the formation of polarization - squeezed spectra .",
    "section [ section6 ] is dedicated to the interference on a bs of two independent quadrature - squeezed usps and their overlap with a coherent usp or with squeezed vacuum .",
    "we reveal that the squeezing is possible in three stokes parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we compare our analytical results with the experimental ones reported in @xcite .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the traditional way to derive the quantum equation for the spm effect is based on the interaction hamiltonian . as a consequence one obtains a time - evolution equation .",
    "the transition to space - evolution equation is usually realized by enforcing the replacement @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance passed inside the kerr medium and @xmath12 is the group velocity .",
    "this approach is reasonable for single - mode radiation .",
    "however , the analytical description of the nonlinear pulse propagation contains both @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "the consistent quantum description of the kerr effect requires then the use of the momentum operator connected with the evolution of the pulse field in space @xcite .",
    "when accounting for the finite relaxation time of the kerr nonlinearity the spm effect is described with the following momentum operator @xcite : @xmath14dt_{1}\\label{spm}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the plank constant , the factor @xmath16 is defined by the kerr nonlinearity of the medium ( @xmath17 @xcite ) , @xmath18 is the normal ordering operator , @xmath19 is the causal nonlinear response function [ @xmath20 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the  photon number density \" operator in the cross - section @xmath11 of the medium , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the photon annihilation and creation bose operators with the commutation relation @xmath27=\\delta{(t_{2}-t_{1})}$ ] , respectively .",
    "the thermal noise is neglected and the expression ( [ spm ] ) is averaged over the thermal fluctuations . in our approach the pulse duration @xmath28 is much greater than the relaxation time @xmath29 , and the kerr medium is lossless and dispersionless ; that is , the frequencies of the pulse are off resonance .    in heisenberg representation ,",
    "the space evolution of @xmath25 is given by the equation @xcite @xmath30.\\ ] ] then , with ( [ spm ] ) the space evolution equation of @xmath25 in the moving coordinate system ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the running time and @xmath12 is the group velocity ) @xmath34 has the solution given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the  photon number density \" operator at the entrance into the medium , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .    in comparison with the so - called nonlinear schrdinger equation , used in the quantum theory of optical solitons",
    "( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , in ( [ part1 ] ) the light pulse dispersion spreading in the medium is absent .",
    "this approach corresponds to the first approximation of the dispersion theory @xcite .",
    "note that the structure of @xmath42 is like that of the linear response in the quantum description of a usp spreading in the second - order approximation .",
    "the statistical features of pulses at the output of the medium can be evaluated by using the algebra of time - dependent bose operators @xcite .",
    "for example , in such algebra we have a permutation relation of the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the nonlinear phase shift per photon . by using the theorem of normal ordering @xcite",
    "one obtains the average values of the bose operators over the initial coherent summary state @xmath46 : @xmath47 the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 are connected with spm of the pulse . here @xmath50 is the nonlinear phase addition caused by spm .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath51 of the annihilation operator @xmath52 over the coherent state @xmath46 can be written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the linear phase of the pulse .",
    "then @xmath55 .",
    "the time dependence can be separated in @xmath56 by introducing the pulse s envelope @xmath57 so that @xmath58 with @xmath59 . for the simplicity of notations",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in ( [ average1 ] ) and ( [ average2 ] )",
    "@xmath62 is the temporal correlator due to spm , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "notice that in our approach there is no assumption about the form of the relaxation function @xmath19 of the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it is positive at any instant @xmath66 and zero otherwise .",
    "if the spm efect is due primarily to the electronic motion occurring on @xmath67 fs time scale ( @xmath68 fs ) , then in the absence of one- and two - photon and raman resonances , the relaxation function at @xmath69 can be approximated in the form @xcite : @xmath70 in the following sections this specific form of the relaxation function is used when evaluating the fourier transform of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the quantum description of the polarization of light is usually done in terms of four stokes operators @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) @xcite . for two spatially overlapping usps the stokes operators",
    "are introduced as follows : @xmath75,\\label{s0}\\\\    \\hat{s}_{1}(t ) & = & \\hat{a}^{+}_{1}(t)\\hat{a}_{1}(t)-\\hat{a}^{+}_{2}(t)\\hat{a}_{2}(t)~~\\ ,    = tr[\\hat{\\sigma}_{3}\\hat{d}^{+}_{1}(t)\\hat{d}_{1}(t)],\\label{s1}\\\\    \\hat{s}_{2}(t ) & = & \\hat{a}^{+}_{2}(t)\\hat{a}_{1}(t)+\\hat{a}^{+}_{1}(t)\\hat{a}_{2}(t)~~\\ ,    = tr[\\hat{\\sigma}_{1}\\hat{d}^{+}_{2}(t)\\hat{d}_{1}(t)],\\label{s2}\\\\    \\hat{s}_{3}(t ) & = &    i[\\hat{a}^{+}_{2}(t)\\hat{a}_{1}(t)-\\hat{a}^{+}_{1}(t)\\hat{a}_{2}(t)]=    tr[-\\hat{\\sigma}_{2}\\hat{d}^{+}_{2}(t)\\hat{d}_{1}(t)]\\label{s3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 are pauli matrices ( @xmath77 ) , and @xmath78-matrices are : @xmath79 the definition of stokes operators @xmath80 in terms of pauli matrices ( [ s1])-([s3 ] ) suggests that in quantum optics they play a similar role to the pauli matrices @xmath76 which in quantum theory of angular momentum describe the rotations in two - spinor formalism .",
    "indeed , apart from a normalization factor , the commutation relations for stokes operators are identical to those for pauli matrices ; @xmath81=2i\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\hat{s}_{k}(t)$ ] , where indices @xmath82 are taken by cyclic permutations . the energy operator @xmath83 commutes with any @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85=0 $ ] .",
    "in addition , the stokes operators generate a special non - abelian unitary group of symmetry transformations su2 that obeys the same lie algebra as the three - dimensional rotation group of pauli matrices .",
    "since the stokes operator @xmath83 describes the total energy of the two pulse field at the time @xmath13 , @xmath84 characterize light polarization and form a cartesian axis system .",
    "the polarization state is visualized as a vector on the poincar sphere and each point on the sphere corresponds to a definite polarization state whose variation is characterized by the motion of the point on the sphere .",
    "if the stokes vector points in the direction of @xmath9 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 , than the polarized part of the beam is horizontally , linearly at @xmath86 , or right - circularly polarized , respectively . when stokes vectors of two usps point in opposite directions pulses do not interfere .",
    "the radius of poincar sphere , i.e. , the average length of the poincar vector @xmath87 , defines the average intensity of the polarized part of the radiation .",
    "the ratio of the intensity of the polarized part to the total average intensity @xmath88 is called degree of polarization @xmath89 and it is an important measure in quantum optics .    to analyze the behavior of quantum fluctuations of stokes operators",
    "@xmath73 we introduce their correlation functions : @xmath90 in the frame of the quantum model for the spm effect presented in section [ section1 ] the correlation functions ( [ c - function ] ) can be analytically computed by using permutation relations of the type ( [ permut ] ) and the averages ( [ average1 ] ) and ( [ average2 ] ) of time - dependent bose operators ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the average values in ( [ c - function ] ) are calculated on the summary coherent quantum state @xmath91 .",
    "we assume here that the initial usps are in coherent states , the @xmath92-th pulse s operator @xmath93 acting only on the corresponding state vector @xmath94 within the associated sub - hilbert space @xmath95 , so the factorization of the quantum states of the two sub - hilbert spaces takes place .",
    "the orthogonal basis of summary states belongs to the global hilbert space @xmath96 .",
    "this basic assumption is followed in the paper when calculating the quantum average of physical quantities of interest",
    ". if both usps are in coherent states , then @xmath97 . as is well known from experiments , if usps undergo some nonlinear transformations ( for example , parametric amplification or spm effect ) and further overlap spatially , than the formation of ps state of light is allowed .",
    "this means that , in the theoretical description of the formation of the ps state in such processes , the correlation functions of stokes parameters are different from @xmath98-function .",
    "however , the polarization squeezing can not be obtained in all stokes parameters at the same time .",
    "we show bellow , by analytically deriving the correlation functions of stokes parameters that the spatial overlap of quadrature - squeezed pulses , the overlap of nonclassical pulses inside an anisotropic kerr medium in the presence of combined spm - xpm effect , or the interference of nonclassical usps on a bs , lead to the formation of the ps state",
    ".    with the correlation function calculated in agreement with ( [ c - function ] ) one can proceed with the evaluation of the spectra @xmath99 of quantum fluctuations of stokes operators at any instant @xmath13 by merely applying the wiener - khintchine ( wk ) theorem , which states that @xmath100 for two coherent usps that overlap spatially the spectrum of quantum fluctuations of @xmath73 is frequency independent and constant , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , the deviation from the coherent level @xmath102 can be used as a measure of quantum fluctuations behavior .",
    "thus , since the case @xmath103 corresponds to anti - squeezing , the case @xmath104 corresponds to the suppression of quantum fluctuations of @xmath73 .",
    "in the quantum model for the spm effect in kerr media developed in @xcite and shortly exposed in section [ section1 ] the finite relaxation time of the electronic nonlinearity is accounted .",
