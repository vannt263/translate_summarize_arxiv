    "quantum heisenberg model with ferromagnetic exchange is used extensively to interpret the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of low dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) physical systems .",

    "@xcite    experimental research of the aforementioned low dimensional magnets is carried out intensively , in particular , in the presence of an external magnetic field . to interpret the experimental data it is necessary to develop a quantitative description of the hfm thermodynamics at arbitrary magnetic fields and temperatures .",

    "the method based on one or another decoupling scheme for higher green functions results in a closed set of self - consistent equations for thermodynamic averages.@xcite random phase approximation ( rpa ) is the simplest variant of such scheme with decoupling at the first step.@xcite being applied to the low dimensional systems it gives satisfactory results at high fields whereas at low and intermediate fields rpa describes the thermodynamics only on a qualitative level .",
    "a quantitative description of 1d and 2d spin systems can be obtained within a more complicated scheme originally proposed in ref . for 1d hfm in zero magnetic field .",
    "the scheme is based on the decoupling of higher green functions at the second step with introducing the vertex parameters to be found .",

    "a single vertex parameter was chosen so as to satisfy the sum rule .",
    "one vertex parameter turned out to be quite enough to describe quantitatively the thermodynamics of 1d and 2d ( on a square and triangular lattices ) ferromagnets in zero field .    when employing the above - mentioned scheme to the spin systems in an external magnetic field , along with the correlators we have to determine at least three additional functions of temperature and field : two vertex parameters and magnetization .",

    "some results obtained by the renormalization group technique @xcite ( rgt ) are known . however",

    "in the present work we show that this method is more effective when the conditions determining the magnetization and vertex parameters result from the fundamental principles . clearly the relations ( [ eq : sum_rules1 ] ) are just of this kind .",
    "it is equally important to retain the analytical properties @xcite of the green functions in the approximate approach .",
    "such a requirement for the transverse commutator green function provides a basis for the third condition in our theory .",

    "the self - consistent set of equations for the correlation functions , vertex parameters and magnetization is obtained in the universal form appropriate for the description of low dimensional hfm on a chain , square and triangular lattices .",
    "the fundamental point of our consideration is the account of the correct analytical properties for the approximate transverse commutator green function , from which the equation for the magnetization follows .",
    "this enables us to extend the range of adequate description for the hfm thermodynamics to lower fields as compared to the scheme proposed in ref . .",
    "the thermodynamics of a triangular lattice hfm in a magnetic field is studied within a second - order green function formalism for the first time .",
    "the temperature dependences of the magnetization , susceptibility , correlation functions , and heat capacity at different values of the magnetic field are calculated and analyzed in detail . for square and triangular lattices the positions and heights of the heat capacity maxima vs field",
    "are obtained .",
    "the dependences of the thermodynamic functions of the 2d hfm on the cluster size are investigated . for both types of lattices",
    "the cluster sizes corresponding to the thermodynamic limit are found as functions of field .",
    "the temperature and field dependences for the thermodynamic functions calculated within our scheme are in close agreement with the corresponding results obtained by bethe ansatz , quantum monte carlo simulations , high temperature series expansion , and exact diagonalization .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the scheme used in this paper provides a good quantitative description for the thermodynamics of the low dimensional hfm in an external magnetic field on the three considered types of lattices for infinite as well as for finite - sized systems .",
