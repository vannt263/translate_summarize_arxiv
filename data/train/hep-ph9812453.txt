    "<S> comparison with data and conclusions *    when comparing the model with experimental data we find two kinds of problems . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is related to the experimental definition of single diffraction dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> the great variety of phenomenological models adopted from different experimental groups , in order to extract the published data , makes difficult the test of any new model . moreover , integrated cross - section do not refer to the same intervals of @xmath23 and @xmath15 , for different experimental analyses .    </S>",
    "<S> the second kind of problem resides in our parametrization and is strongly related to the first one . while the pion contribution can be fixed as in section 2 , the parameters relative to the @xmath32 trajectory must be refitted since the pomeron contribution is quite different from the one proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the parameter @xmath60 requires fine tuning , since its value must be larger than @xmath92 , and the choice of the function @xmath52 has been made only on the basis of its small @xmath15 behaviour .    in view of these difficulties </S>",
    "<S> , we simplify the analysis by neglecting the @xmath32-contri + bution together with the @xmath93 interference term . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 contribution has no free parameters and we are left with three parameters for the pomeron and a possible correction to the slope @xmath72 .    by comparing the slope of @xmath94 , at fixed @xmath95 and in the interval @xmath96 , with the cdf @xcite and ua8 @xcite best fits , we find that at @xmath97 the prediction of the model is well within the experimental errors if we choose @xmath98 and keep the previous value for @xmath72 , @xmath73 . at @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> the slope agrees with @xcite and simulates the effect of a non linear pomeron trajectory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> larger values of the parameter @xmath60 are compatible with the experimental slope and bring forth a flatter total diffractive cross section , as can be seen from the pomeron contribution ( [ z15 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> then we performed a fit , at fixed @xmath100 , of the cdf data @xcite , taken from the providential compilation in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a and 1b show that the proposed model is adequate as far as the @xmath101 dependence is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> only the data above the resonance region , @xmath102 , and in the coherence region @xcite , @xmath103 , have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the fit are @xmath104 , with strong correlations between them .    if we consider the data at smaller @xmath12 , @xmath105 , @xcite compiled in @xcite , the calculated cross section is well below the experimental points . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute such a discrepancy to the neglect of the @xmath32 trajectory that , in this energy region , plays an important role in @xmath19 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 contribution could also modify sensibly the imaginary part of the @xmath53 amplitude in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z3 ] ) .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] the total single diffractive cross section @xmath106 , for the process @xmath107 , is shown as a function of @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the experimental data of @xcite from the compilation given in @xcite where some data have been corrected in order to obtain the diffraction cross section for @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the absence of the @xmath32 trajectory makes the cross section too small at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> analogous results have been obtained in a theoretical model @xcite and can be deduced from a phenomenological parametrization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the cross - section rises as @xmath110 in this model </S>",
    "<S> . a more complete fit of all the data will be considered elsewhere .    from the theoretical pointof view , the result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) possesses two important properties that seem required by the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , exact factorization , typical of the regge pole model , is lost in the dipole pomeron approach . </S>",
    "<S> second , for @xmath77 , the pomeron and pion contributions are independent of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we remark that this model respects the unitarity condition without decoupling of the triple pomeron vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the total diffractive cross section presents a slower rise than the total @xmath19 cross section that , in turn , satisfies the froissart bound . </S>"
