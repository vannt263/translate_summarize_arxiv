    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    _ discussion._a discussion of the shortcomings of our analysis and the conditions needed for the successful observation of the physics that have we described here is in order . </S>",
    "<S> a few approximations have been made in our analysis which may not hold in a realistic sample . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the system is uniformly irradiated by a coherent source . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a real experiment , the irradiation within the sample will be limited to be within the skin depth . for a skin depth of a few layers of the atomic structure , the actual value of the radiation needed to observe an oscillation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : deli ] , will need to be modified , although we expect the effect to remain intact . </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of our proposal is that the radiation intensity required is low and in fact , decreases with increasing system size , though the length of the system might be limited by the coherence length of the laser . </S>",
    "<S> we leave more detailed studies studies , including the effect of decaying radiation amplitude through the sample , for the future .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented our results for a simple model of a wsm with four weyl nodes along a particular axis . </S>",
    "<S> real systems often have many more weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> however , along any particular direction , it is not natural to expect more than four weyl nodes , so we expect our results to hold even in those systems as long as the josephson current is measured along the direction in which the weyl nodes are expected .    </S>",
    "<S> _ summary and conclusion._to summarize , in this paper we have studied , first , how the @xmath0-@xmath1 transitions in the josephson current in a time - reversal invariant wsm can result from the presence of chiral nodes . without breaking the time - reversal symmetry , and hence , retaining the topological stability of the weyl nodes , we have presented a way to observe such oscillations by an all - electric tunable setup using linearly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented numerical evidence of such @xmath0-@xmath1 transitions , which are highly anisotropic and depend strongly on the orientation of the weyl nodes .    </S>",
