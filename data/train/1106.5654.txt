    "there are two long - standing problems in the theory of open quantum systems  memory effects and the influence of initial statistical correlations on the system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these problems take on special significance in the theory of decoherence ( i.e. , the environment - induced destruction of quantum coherence ) , since the decoherence time scale is usually much shorter than the time scales for other relaxation processes in a system .",
    "the well - known nakajima - zwanzig projection operator technique  @xcite and its modifications  @xcite provide formally exact non - markovian master equations for almost arbitrary open systems and initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to solve these equations for more or less realistic models .",
    "thanks to the work of many people ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , we possess today some partial advancements in constructing reasonable approximations for non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems , but a systematic general approach is still lacking .    the simplest systems involving many of fundamental features of quantum coherence are two - state systems",
    ". such systems are important in their own right as the elementary carriers of quantum information ( qubits )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , some two - state models admit exact solutions .",
    "the latter fact is very useful because it allows one to gain valuable insight into general properties of the dynamics of decoherence and can serve as a step toward consistent approximations for more complicated open systems .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite two exactly solvable models have been used to reconstruct the corresponding exact non - markovian master equations and study in detail their memory kernels .",
    "it would be interesting to apply a similar approach to situations with non - negligible initial correlations between an open system and its environment .",
    "recently  @xcite , an exact analytic solution was obtained for a qubit model  @xcite with initial qubit - environment correlations .",
    "the results demonstrate new interesting features of decoherence in the presence of initial correlations .",
    "unfortunately , the initial state considered in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be somewhat artificial since it relies on the assumption that the qubit + environment system is initially prepared in a pure quantum state at zero temperature . in this paper",
    "we show that the model  @xcite admits exact solutions for a large class of physically reasonable correlated initial states at finite temperatures and derive explicit expressions for the coherences ( off - diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix ) .",
    "the distinctive feature of the dephasing model  @xcite is that the average populations of the qubit states do not depend on time .",
    "in other words , there is no relaxation to complete equilibrium between the qubit and the environment , i.e. , the model is _",
    "nonergodic_. curiously enough this feature may be considered as an advantage of the model .",
    "indeed , since the relaxation time @xmath0 for dissipative processes is usually much larger than the decoherence ( dephasing ) time @xmath1 , the model  @xcite corresponds to the limiting case @xmath2 , when all irrelevant corrections due to energy dissipation are removed .",
