    "it is well known that the hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in galaxy clusters radiates enormous amounts of energy at x - ray wavelengths ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "taken at face value , this loss of energy from the icm implies that the gas should be cooling , losing pressure support and flowing inward .",
    "early cooling flow models predicted cooling and star formation rates on the order of @xmath8 @xmath9 yr@xmath10 ( fabian 1994 ) . the lack of widespread detection of iron lines expected from cluster gas cooling below 1 - 2 kev in xmm - newton observations of cool core clusters ( peterson et al .",
    "2003 ) contradicted this model and created the need to incorporate non - gravitational heating mechanisms to counterbalance the radiative energy loss .",
    "while these observations have effectively ruled out accretion flows large enough to form an @xmath11 galaxy in 100 myr , they do not preclude that star formation is ongoing in cool core clusters at a much reduced rate .",
    "the level of star formation still allowed is uncertain and it is important to investigate this through means independent of the x - ray - determined mass flow rate . of particular interest is the distinction between models in which heating completely balances cooling and those in which heating offsets most but not all of the radiative losses .",
    "if significant star formation is occurring as a result of a heating imbalance it should be reflected in the optical properties of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , which is often found deep within the cluster potential . a good way to test",
    "this is to look for links between the bcg optical properties with the x - ray properties of their host clusters .",
    "in fact , several case studies over the last two decades have found evidence for recent star formation in the central galaxies of cool core clusters ( johnstone et al .",

    ", single - component @xmath12 devaucouleurs model is fit with the following functional form :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the effective intensity and effective radius respectively .",
    "the term @xmath16 is a constant background intensity term which is also included as a fit parameter . to determine the psf we measure the surface brightness profile of an unsaturated star close to the bcg .",
    "the total integrated distribution is then normalized to unity in order to conserve total flux when applying the psf as a convolution response function in bcg modeling .",
    "we fit a moffat profile ( moffat 1969 ) to the psf star with the following form :    @xmath17^{-\\beta}+i_{bgd } \\label{eqn : moffat}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is a term added to take into account the local background level and @xmath18 is left as a free parameter .",
    "estimates for the error in surface brightness for each radial bin are obtained by bootstrapping the pixel values in that bin .",
    "bcg source pixels are randomly selected in each radial bin , allowing a given pixel to be selected multiple times .",
    "this has the advantage that we do not need to make any apriori assumption of the functional form of the noise ( ie .",
    "poisson noise ) , or to know the precise values of exposure times , gain or read - noise .",
    "bootstrapping not only accounts for the random noise in the data , it also incorporates some of the contribution from non - uniform , systematic variations ( bright stars , variability in galactic dust absorption , crowding effects of nearby galaxy / group light , etc . ) across the cluster image .",
    "we note , however , that bootstrapping estimates misrepresent the true error in radial bins that have only a few pixels available to randomly sample .",
    "the bcg fitting procedure is restricted to data points at radii larger than twice the fwhm of the derived moffat profile psf ( @xmath19 ) . ignoring the central bins",
    "helps to ensure that any small error in the psf determination will not seriously affect the bcg fit .",
    "an upper radial cutoff to the fitting region is also applied .",
    "the fit is initially restricted to those data points that lie at radii less than @xmath20 from the bcg centre .",
    "this radius is chosen somewhat arbitrarily but it reflects an effort to isolate the bcg component within the overall cluster diffuse light profile .",
    "the psf - convolved devaucouleurs + background model is then fit to the data lying within these two limits as described above .",
    "a second iteration of the fit is then performed with the maximum fit radius set to 1.5@xmath21 and an extra term is added to @xmath22 .",
    "the second fit iteration uses a @xmath22 calculated as follows :    @xmath23    where the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to the first and second fit iteration parameters respectively . the extra background term in @xmath26 acts as a penalty to any major change in the background parameter and ensures that the background is primarily determined / constrained by the larger radius fit range .",
    "the reduction in the fit range of the second fit iteration helps to further isolate the bcg signal with an upper radial cutoff that is motivated by the shape of the galaxy itself .",
    "examples of the marginalized @xmath22 contours are shown in figure [ fig : chi2surf2259 ] for the fits to the abell 2259 bcg surface brightness profile .",
    "it is immediately seen that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the most degenerate parameter pair , highlighting a common trait of all of bcg surface brightness fits in the cccp sample . by leaving the background as a free parameter in the fitting routine , even though the image has been background subtracted , this technique shows how the remaining structural properties of the bcg are affected by a possible error in background . by inspection of the @xmath22 contours shown in figures [ fig : chi2surf2259 ]",
    "it can be seen that a 3@xmath27 error in the background can affect the derived @xmath4 effective radius @xmath15 at the 3 - 4 % level for abell 2259 .",
    "the marginalized @xmath22 surface diagrams are also useful for analyzing the stability of the fitting routine for a given bcg . in summary , these data indicate that our bcg fitting procedure determines the structural parameters with high precession ( within a few % ) and that the effects of error in the background subtraction are negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : sb31_mega ] shows the surface brightness profiles in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands for all bcgs that were observed with megacam while figure [ fig : sb23_12k ] shows the surface brightness profiles of all bcgs that were observed with cfh12k .",
    "the measured data are shown by the points , solid lines correspond to best fit psf - convolved @xmath12 models as described in the above section and dotted lines show similar fits without psf convolution . surface brightness data is colour coded by wavelength band with @xmath4 and @xmath28 data shown in red and @xmath3 and @xmath29 data shown in blue . in all cases the bcgs are brighter in the red filter than in the blue filter with a typical offset on the order of one magnitude at all radii .",

    "note that even though this is not a direct fit to the colour profile the difference between the individual fits to the data frames match the colour data well in most cases .",
    "see section [ colourprodiscuss ] for discussion .",
    "the measurement of surface brightness profiles of bcgs requires a detailed understanding of the various sources of systematic effects that may contaminate the signal .",
    "previous bcg and icl studies have employed a wide variety of tests that aim to quantify these sources of contamination ( gonzalez et al . 2005 , krick et al . 2005 , patel et al .",
    "the following sections describe the tests that are used in this paper to investigate the contributions of systematics effects and the steps taken to minimize them .",
    "the measurement of bcg surface brightness is complicated by the effects of crowding .",
    "the shallow surface brightness profiles of other luminous galaxies in the field often overlap with that of the bcg . the method used to create the mask",
    "therefore systematically affects the measured profile .",
    "the most common mask generation method used in the literature rejects pixels around non - bcg galaxies that lie inside a particular isophote @xmath31 ( lin and mohr 2004 , feldmeier et al .",
    "2004 , zibetti et al .",
    "2005 , krick et al .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that the methodology is clearly defined and reproducible , the disadvantage however , is that it does not take into account the profile shapes .",
    "the mask generation method used here is not limited to a particular isophotal cutoff and faint shallow wings of bcg neighbors are masked extensively . in this section",
    "we discuss the tests used to evaluate the influence of mask effects on surface brightness .",
    "the test described here is designed to look for signal contamination by comparing the profiles in different angular sections of the bcg .",
    "the image is divided along the bcg major and minor axes into four quadrants . under the assumption of zero contamination ,",
    "the profiles measured in each quadrant should be identical .",
    "the differences between the profiles in different quadrants is a measure of the asymmetric component of the contamination signal .",
    "there are other causes of variation in the quadrant profiles such as asymmetric masking and position angle twists .",
    "for instance , if an individual quadrant is heavily masked near the minor axis then the measured profile in that quadrant is more representative of the surface brightness along the major axis and is brighter than the ideal unmasked , zero contamination case . in this way ,",
    "slight variation in the masking from one quadrant to another introduces scatter among the four quadrant profiles .",
    "this test is applied to all bcgs and the presence of large scatter in the quadrant profiles is used to determine the radial limit to which the bcg surface brightness data are reliable in each of the images ( @xmath32 ) .    the plots shown in figure [ fig : mask_incomp2.eps ] show the result of the masking incompleteness tests for the bcgs in the clusters abell 2261 and abell 2537 .",
    "the profiles in the four quadrants are shown as different coloured curves .",
    "dotted lines indicate the radial limit ( @xmath32 ) to which the the bcg profile is minimally affected by asymmetric mask incompleteness .",
    "the profile deviations seen in the @xmath4 image of abell 2537 just inside @xmath32 are due to a position angle twist of the bcg .",
    "this effect is symmetric in two of the four quadrants and anti - symmetric in the other two .",
    "another major source of systematic error in bcg / icl studies comes about from large scale flatfielding error and large scale variations in the background .",
    "feldmeier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and patel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) present methods that can be used in order to quantify some of the properties of background variation on a variety of scales .",
    "similar methods are used here in order to quantify the image background variability .",
    "each image is portioned into a rectangular grid .",
    "the background statistics are determined within each grid square using the same mask that is used to measure bcg surface brightness .",
    "this process is repeated with variety of grid sizes in order to examine background variation on different scales .",
    "the results of this procedure reveal the presence of structure in the background as a function of distance from the bcg centre and size of the grid .    to quantify the effects of large - scale structure we examine the statistics of 10 independent surface brightness profiles that are centreed on various parts of the image background . from the analysis of several cluster images ,",
    "we conclude that the variance in the background signal begins to dominate the surface brightness measurements at a typical limit of @xmath33 @xmath34 but that brighter than this limit , large - scale error does not significantly contribute to the bcg signal .",
    "we test for the possibility that some of the bcg / icl might be removed in the background subtraction process due to its large extent . examining a range of mesh sizes used for background determination ,",
    "we conclude that this is not an important effect for the results presented here ( 5% difference in @xmath15 in the most extreme case ) ."
