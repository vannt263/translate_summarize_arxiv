    "damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers are clouds of high column density neutral hydrogen gas seen in absorption in the spectrum of a bright background source , usually a qso .",
    "these are the highest column density absorption systems and are generally found in galaxies where the gas is predominantly neutral ( for a detailed description and review of dla studies see @xcite ) .",
    "these absorption line systems are particularly useful for tracing the densest neutral hydrogen gas , and thereby tracing gas - rich galaxies , throughout the universe .",
    "dla observations are unique in that they allow us to detect high redshift galaxies in a manner that is almost entirely independent of galaxy luminosity  the requirement to detect the dla is a bright background qso and a high enough column density of  gas in the foreground galaxy . in this way a large number of gas - rich galaxies and/or protogalaxies have been identified in the distant universe . in order to determine the properties of these systems , @xcite and @xcite have used the kinematics of dla absorption lines to argue that dlas originate in massive spiral galaxies .",
    "however , there is a growing body of evidence that these systems span the range of gas - rich galaxy morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dlas are gas - rich galaxies some of which are massive , luminous , and easy to detect , but many others are compact , low luminosity , or low surface brightness systems that are difficult to detect at large distances .",
    "because many of the galaxies associated with dlas remain undetected , it can be difficult to make the connection between the dense neutral gas and the properties of the galaxy within which it resides .",
    "for this reason , the small number of dlas for which the associated galaxy has been identified provide important information about the properties and environment of dlas .",
    "in this paper we present a discussion of the properties and environment of sbs 1543 + 593 , one of these select systems for which the associated galaxy has been identified .",
    "sbs 1543 + 593 is one of the nearest known dlas outside of the local group ( only ngc 4203/ton 1480 is closer , @xcite ) .",
    "a qso was discovered at the position of this system as part of a qso survey .",
    "subsequently it was realized that the qso lay behind this nearby foreground galaxy @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is a low surface brightness galaxy ( lsb ; @xmath3(r ) = 22.4 ; @xcite ) with an hi mass of @xmath4 m  @xcite .",
    "the qso sightline has provided a probe of the interstellar medium in the foreground galaxy as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the galactic environment in which a dla resides can have a significant impact on its properties and its evolution .",
    "however , the galactic environment of dlas , particularly on small scales and in the local universe , remains largely unknown .",
    "for one system at @xmath5 , at least 4 galaxies have been detected within 5 @xmath6 mpc and the  in the dla is found to be highly turbulent @xcite . at @xmath7",
    "there have also been a number of studies of the clustering of dlas .",
    "several of these studies failed to detect any clustering of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) with dlas at @xmath7 @xcite because of poor statistics .",
    "however , other larger studies arrive at inconsistent results on the clustering of these populations ",
    "@xcite find that the dla - lbg cross correlation is comparable to the lbg autocorrelation implying that dlas are strongly clustered massive halos while @xcite find that the dla - lbg clustering implies that the dlas are less strongly clustered and therefore reside in lower mass halos .    because of the importance of environment on the evolution of galaxies , we use the data on sbs1543 + 593 not only to probe the properties of this nearby dla but also to probe its gaseous environment .",
    "previous studies of low surface brightness galaxies like sbs 1543 + 593 have shown that dlas are generally less clustered on scales of a few mpc than their higher surface brightness counterparts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is not unusual for lsbs to reside in small groups on scales of @xmath2 0.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "the low redshift of sbs 1543 + 593 makes it possible to study the environment of this low surface brightness dla in detail .    in this paper",
    "we use vla 21 cm observations to map the neutral gas in and around sbs 1543 + 593 and present @xmath8-band data for its three newly identified companions .",
    "we discuss the vla and optical observations of sbs 1543 + 593 and the new companions in  2 . in ",
    "3 we present the results including a discussion of the relationship between the  and optical distributions in sbs 1543 + 593 (  3.1 ) and in the newly identified dwarf galaxies (  3.2 ) .",
    "most of the work that has been done on the environment of lsb galaxies has relied on the optical detection of their neighbors .",
    "observations provide a means of tracing the gas in the region . in ",
    "3.3 we discuss the small scale  environment and large scale structure in this region .",
    "finally , in  4 we discuss the impact of our findings .",
    "we assume a value of h@xmath9  mpc@xmath10 throughout this paper .",
    "we use vla c - array data of sbs 1543 + 593 to study the  distribution and environment of this nearby dla . within these data",
    "we identify sbs 1543 + 593 , the low surface brightness galaxy observed as a dla along the sight line to the qso hs 1543 + 5921 ( @xmath11 ) and 3 previously unknown companions within @xmath2185 kpc of the galaxy ( see figure [ fig : region ] for a picture of the region ) .",
    "the vla data were taken on august 13th and 14th , 2001 and consist of 283 minutes of observations on the source plus observations of 3c286 as a flux and bandpass calibrator and of 3c343 as a complex gain calibrator .",
    "the observations were made in 2 if mode with the bandpass centered at 1.4069 ghz ( 2971 ) , close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy measured from single dish observations by @xcite .",
    "one if covered a bandwidth of 1.5 mhz with a velocity resolution of 5.0 channel@xmath10 .",
    "the second if covered a bandwidth of 3.0 mhz at a velocity resolution of 20.6 channel@xmath10 .",
    "the high and low velocity resolution data were both reduced using standard aips data reduction techniques .",
    "the high velocity resolution data , which contain only sbs 1543 + 593 itself , were fourier transformed using the task imagr with robust=0 ( a compromise between uniform weighting and natural weighting ) which resulted in a final cube with a clean beam of 15  @xmath12 14 .",
    "moment maps were created from this cube using momnt to integrate over the channels which show line emission and an equivalent single dish spectrum was created by running ispec for the spatial region of the cube in which emission is detected .",
    "the lower resolution data were used for the observations of sbs 1543 + 593 s neighbors .",
    "these data were fourier transformed using imagr with natural weighting and produced a final cube with a 19  @xmath13  clean beam .",
    "the newly detected galaxies were far from the field center and were , therefore , significantly affected by primary beam attenuation . in order to extract all of the signal",
    "while minimizing the spurious noise spikes , the low velocity resolution data were analyzed as follows : ( 1 ) the imaged data cube was convolved with a 30  @xmath12 30  beam that was then clipped to keep only the data above 2-@xmath14 ( 0.7 mjy ) , ( 2 ) all emission that was not correlated over a few channels as identified by - eye with tvmovie , was clipped as noise since genuine emission should exist over several velocity channels , ( 3 ) the cube that resulted from steps 1 and 2 was used to select the regions of emission from the original unsmoothed data cube using blank , ( 4 ) the resulting data cube was then used to make moment maps ( using xmom ) and equivalent single dish spectra ( using ispec ) . note that the data blanking for the low velocity resolution cube means that pixels in which there is no detectable  emission were blanked leaving signal only in the limited number of pixels where significant galaxy emission was detected .",
    "the rms noise in these data cubes is 0.35 mjy . for a 50  wide source at the center of the field ,",
    "a galaxy with 3.4 @xmath15 m  of  would be a 5@xmath14 detection at 40.7 mpc ( the distance of sbs 1543 + 593 ) .",
    "the companions detected near sbs 1543 + 593 include mcg+10 - 22 - 038 , a previously cataloged galaxy without a known redshift and two previously uncataloged systems , rbtb154542.8 + 591132 and rbtb154607.7 + 591013 .",
    "for simplicity we will refer to the latter two galaxies as dwarf 1 and dwarf 2 .",
    "the rms in the region of these detections falls to @xmath21.6 mjy corresponding to @xmath21.6@xmath16 m  so these newly identified dwarfs are near the detection limit at this distance from the center of the field .",
    "figure [ fig : region ] shows optical and  21 cm maps of this region .",
    "the lower panel is the poss2 blue image of the region ; the upper panel is the corresponding vla  map .",
    "the three new galaxies form a tight group slightly offset from sbs 1543 + 593 .",
    "no other galaxies were identified in the vla data .",
    "the equivalent single dish spectra for the galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : hispec ] .",
    "the spectrum of sbs 1543 + 593 was created from the higher velocity resolution smaller bandwidth if data .",
    "the companion galaxy spectra were made from the larger bandwidth , lower velocity resolution data .",
    "the lack of noise in the baseline of these lower resolution spectra is a result of the noise clipping described above .",
    "figure [ fig : hispec ] shows that the companion galaxies all have similar recession velocities which are offset from the velocity of sbs 1543 + 593 by @xmath2150 .",
    "the velocities , velocity widths , and  masses for the galaxies are calculated from these spectra and the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "we assume a distance of 40.7 mpc for all of the sources based on the recession velocity of sbs 1543 + 593 .",
    "the  sizes for these galaxies were all computed at the 1 m  pc@xmath17 level .",
    "the sizes were computed by fitting isophotal contours to the data using the ellipse routine which is part of the stsdas package in iraf . except for dwarf 2 which is well fit by elliptical contours",
    ", we fit the galaxies with circular isophotes to determine the sizes .",
    "for sbs 1543 + 593 we measure an  mass of 1.2@xmath18 m , consistent with the values measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mcg+10 - 22 - 038 is the only previously known galaxy of the three neighbors to sbs 1543 + 593 , but it did not have a cataloged redshift so its proximity to the dla was not previously known .",
    "therefore , mcg+10 - 22 - 038 has an  mass of 1.1@xmath18 while dwarf 1 and dwarf 2 are lower mass systems with  masses of 1.8 @xmath16  and 2.0@xmath16  respectively .      the optical data for sbs 1543 + 593 and its neighbors consist of @xmath19-band imaging from the apache point 3.5 m for all of the objects except for mcg+10 - 22 - 038 ( the only previously cataloged neighbor ) and @xmath8-band imaging from the kitt peak 0.9 m for all of sbs 1543 + 593 s neighbors .",
    "the optical properties of sbs 1543 + 593 are discussed in detail in @xcite and are included here for discussion with respect to the properties of the neighbors .",
    "we also use the image of sbs 1543 + 593 taken with the gemini multi - object spectrograph r - g0303 ( exposure time 1800 seconds ) by @xcite for comparison with the hi data .",
    "standard calibration frames and a single @xmath8-band image of the region surrounding mcg+10 - 22 - 038 were obtained at the kitt peak 0.9 m in april 2002 .",
    "standard iraf procedures were used to bias subtract , flat field , illumination correct and cosmic ray clean the image . for",
    "a complete description of the flux calibration see @xcite . in order to subtract the background before photometry",
    "could be performed , a five pixel wide annulus was placed around each galaxy beyond the edge of the emission from the object .",
    "the median value from this annulus was used to subtract the background .",
    "aperture photometry was then performed on each galaxy using ellipse . for mcg+10 - 22 - 038 and dwarf 1 we used circular apertures while for dwarf 2 we use an elliptical aperture with an ellipticity of @xmath20 and a position angle of @xmath21 .",
    "the optical data that exist for these galaxies are r - band and v - band measurements . however , because they tend to be blue systems , low surface brightness galaxies are usually ( in the literature ) measured at b - band . in order to compare with results from the literature we assume colors for the conversion of the central surface brightnesses and magnitudes to b - band . for the @xmath22 color of sbs 1543 + 593 s neighbors we assume the median color for dwarf low surface brightness galaxies from the sample of @xcite , @xmath23 . for the @xmath24 color of sbs 1543 + 593",
    "we assume the mean color , @xmath25 , for lsbs ( not dwarfs ) from @xcite .",
    "optical diameters of the galaxies were determined in three different ways to allow us to make comparisons with data from the literature .",
    "the measurements of these diameters are included in table 2 : ( 1 ) the galaxy diameter within which we compute the total magnitude .",
    "the diameter of the aperture was determined by fitting apertures until the flux stopped growing , indicating that we had hit the background ( which was well inside the annulus used to fit the background ) . for dwarf 1 and",
    "dwarf 2 , this aperture method was applied to the @xmath8-band images and then the same aperture was used to derive the total @xmath19-band flux ( d@xmath26 ) . ( 2 ) the diameter where the galaxy reaches an isophotal level of 25 mag arcsec@xmath17 ( d@xmath27 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the diameter measured at 6.4 times the scale length of the galaxy ( d@xmath28 ) . as with the magnitudes , we have measured diameters in different bands than the literature values .",
    "in order to convert from our measurement of isophotal diameter to b - band isophotal diameter we use d@xmath29/d@xmath30 from @xcite and , by extrapolation , that d@xmath31/d@xmath32 . the galaxy scale length is assumed to be independent of wavelength in this optical range as was found by @xcite for their late - type dwarf galaxy sample .",
    "figure [ fig : profs ] shows the @xmath19-band surface brightness profile for sbs 1543 + 593 and the @xmath8-band surface brightness profiles for mcg+10 - 22 - 038 , dwarf 1 , and dwarf 2 .",
    "fits to the exponential region of the surface brightness profiles are shown with dashed lines .",
    "the central surface brightnesses ( corrected to @xmath33-band ) listed in table 2 are the extrapolation of this fit to the center of the galaxy .",
    "all of these galaxies have low central surface brightnesses .",
    "the surface brightness rises sharply towards the center of sbs 1543 + 593 because of the combination of light from the nucleus and the background qso . for sbs 1543 + 593",
    "we have determined the b - band central surface brightness assuming ( b - r ) = 0.2 @xcite .",
    "dwarf 1 has a @xmath33-band central surface brightness ( assuming b - v = 0.49 ) of @xmath34(b ) @xmath35 mag arcsec@xmath17 and a flat surface brightness profile . mcg+10",

    "this contour represents a 4-@xmath14 detection in a single channel of this map ( the figure shows the integration of 20 channels ) .",
    "the  distribution shown in figure [ fig : sbsmap ] is consistent with the map of @xcite .",
    "the highest column density  in the central region of the galaxy follows the optical light .",
    "two regions of particular interest have been labeled in figure [ fig : sbsmap ] .",
    "region 1 is outside of the main spiral structure , has high gas density , and is a region of low surface brightness stellar emission .",
    "this emission comes from slightly farther out than the spiral arms that are visible and appears to point in the opposite direction .",
    "the reason for this disturbance in the spiral arm structure is unclear but could point to a minor interaction in the past .",
    "the bright optical emission located near region 2 is a background spiral galaxy ( discernible in the inset stis image of the region ) .",
    "the most striking feature in the combination of the optical and  images is that there is a large fraction of the  disk that shows little evidence for stellar emission even in this deep gmos image .",
    "significant asymmetries exist in the inner regions of the galaxy and more minor asymmetries in the outer regions .",
    "figure [ fig : sbsvelmap ] shows the  column density distribution in greyscale overlaid with the  velocity contours .",
    "the figure shows a regular velocity gradient as would be expected from the rotation of an inclined spiral galaxy .",
    "however , note that the velocity of region 1 is set off by closed contours , not exactly following the rotation curve of the galaxy . nevertheless , this is not a large deviation from the rotation velocity as it is not visible in the rotation curve of the northern side of the galaxy as shown in figure [ fig : rotcur ] .",
    "the velocity field as produced by aips was ported to gipsy @xcite and was used to determine the rotation curve and orientation ( inclination and position angle ) of the galaxy .",
    "we used the task rotcur to perform a least squares fit to the radial velocity field solving for the following parameters : the position of the dynamical center , and the systemic velocity .",
    "fits were made using the conventional approach ",
    "reasonable starting values were provided for the galaxy center and its systemic velocity and were kept fixed while fits were made in 10  wide annuli to solve for the inclination , position angle and rotation curve .",
    "these resulting values were then kept fixed and rotcur was left to determine improved solutions for the position of the dynamical center and the systemic velocity .",
    "this was repeated until the process converged , resulting in the position of the kinematic center ( in excellent agreement with the position of the optical nucleus ) , the systemic velocity ( v@xmath42=2867.4 km / s ) , inclination ( @xmath43 ) , and position angle ( pa = 344 ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the values derived by @xcite  v@xmath42",
    "= 2870 , @xmath44 , and pa = 344 .",
    "several runs were made , allowing one or more parameters to vary , investigating for example if there are indications for a warp .",
    "there was no compelling case , though , for either the inclination or position angle to vary with radius .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is plotted in figure [ fig : rotcur ] . in order to check for asymmetries we performed a fit on the northern and southern halves of the galaxy separately and",
    "these results are plotted as well ( dotted and dashed line ) .",
    "we derive slightly higher rotation velocities at each point than @xcite  we find an inclination corrected rotation speed at 60  of v@xmath45 = 52  corresponding to a dynamical mass of m@xmath46(60 ) = 7@xmath18 m  as compared with their value of m@xmath46(60 ) = 5@xmath18 m. from our measurements the rotation curve appears to be flat or slightly rising out to at least 100  indicating m@xmath46(100 ) > @xmath471@xmath48 m.    figure [ fig : sbsmap ] shows that the  disk of sbs 1543 + 593 is much larger than the optical extent . the  to optical size ratios , d@xmath49/d@xmath50 and d@xmath49/d@xmath51 indicate that the galaxy has an extended  disk relative to its stellar light .",
    "spiral galaxies typically have  disks that are extended relative to the stellar disks with values of 1.7 for both of these ratios @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies tend to have even more extended  disks with values of 3.3 and 1.8 for these ratios respectively @xcite making this a fairly normal gas - rich low surface brightness galaxy once the extremely low surface brightness has been accounted for . in addition , sbs 1543 + 593 is unusually faint for a galaxy with this mass of hi : m@xmath49/l@xmath52 while the average value is only 1.5 for late - type dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "sbs 1543 + 593 and its companions also fall along the hi size ",
    "hi mass relationship for galaxies from @xcite .",
    "sbs 1543 + 593 is slightly larger than most objects along that relation , but not by a significant margin .    with an r - band measurement and a ( b - r ) color with a large uncertainty ( 0.2 @xmath53 0.3 ) for sbs 1543 + 593 the stellar mass of the galaxy can not be determined , but the padova 1994 models of @xcite can be used to place limits on the stellar population .",
    "these limits are based on the assumption of a salpeter initial mass function , a metallicity of 0.2z@xmath54 ( the closest model metallicity to the present day abundance of 0.3z@xmath54 , @xcite ) , and a single stellar population .",
    "the upper limit to the stellar mass adding the assumption that the stellar population is 13.7 gyr old is 8.1@xmath16 m , but the model galaxy color , ( b - r ) = 0.82 , is too red compared with the measured color indicating that the stellar population is not maximally old .",
    "alternatively , the lower limit to the stellar mass is 4.2@xmath55 m  assuming an age for the stellar population of 3.5 myr for which ( b - r ) = -0.08 from the models which is consistent with the galaxy color within the errors . assuming the measured ( b - r ) color to identify a ",

    "the optical light in the galaxy is dominated by stars that have formed recently . however , because it is impossible to rule out the existence of an underlying old stellar population with the available information , this may be a young galaxy or it may be one that has been extremely inefficient in turning its gas into stars .",

    "overall the  disk of sbs 1543 + 593 is does not show evidence for strong star formation  it is optically low surface brightness even in the regions of high  column density . the second contour in figure [ fig : sbsmap ] is only a factor of 2 below the upper end of the hydrogen mass surface density threshold for star formation which includes the molecular gas component @xcite .",

    "for the small detection volume covered by our vla map , a conservative estimate of the average galaxy density would predict 8.6@xmath71 galaxies down to log(m@xmath49/ ) @xmath72 , the detection limit of these observations at the distance of the detected galaxies , in the field using the  mass function from @xcite . because this region is not an unbiased position",
    " since it was centered around a known galaxy and galaxies tend to cluster  a higher than average galaxy density should not be surprising .",
    "however , the detection of 3 galaxies in the immediate vicinity of sbs 1543 + 593 indicates a significant overdensity with respect to the field .",
    "the high density is also significant given that lsb galaxies tend to have fewer near neighbors than their higher surface brightness counterparts @xcite .",
    "while the galaxy overdensity in this region is statistically significant , there is a large variation in the number of nearest neighbors to low surface brightness galaxies ( @xmath34(b ) @xmath73 23 mag arcsec@xmath17 ) on scales less than 0.5 mpc @xcite , and the expected number of low luminosity gas - rich neighbors is entirely unknown .    finding dlas in regions that contain several low luminosity galaxies is not unusual .",
    "this then implies the presence of several low luminosity systems makes it much more difficult at high redshift to unequivocally identify which object is responsible for the absorption .",
    "@xcite find a dla at @xmath74 for which the associated galaxy is unidentified , but there are several other galaxies in the vicinity including a dwarf with l@xmath75l@xmath76 which is more than 140 kpc from the line of sight .",
    "this system is at too high a redshift to be studied at 21 cm so the gaseous properties of the system are unknown , but otherwise the environment of this dla appears to be similar to that of sbs 1543 + 593 . as we look deeper both in the optical and at 21 cm , we may find that it is not uncommon for dlas to be associated with young gas - rich galaxy groups .",
    "in fact , the combination of rings , tidal features and gas - rich neighbors could contribute to the multiple kinematic components often seen in high resolution dla observations @xcite .",
    "the presence of a significant amount of gas surrounding galaxy groups is also consistent with the determination that most of the low column density  seen in absorption in the lyman-@xmath0 forest is also associated with galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "on large scales , low surface brightness galaxies ( @xmath34(b ) @xmath73 23 mag arcsec@xmath17 ) are found to follow the overall large scale structure , but are slightly less clustered than their higher surface brightness counterparts @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cones ] shows the distribution of galaxies from the zcat catalog @xcite , which includes data from the cfa survey as well as from several other galaxy surveys , in the region surrounding sbs 1543 + 593 ( small black filled circles ) .",
    "the grey triangle shows the position of sbs 1543 + 593 while the open circles show the positions of the newly identified galaxies ( the points fall nearly on top of one another ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates the line of sight to the qso hs 1543 + 5921 .",
    "the plot shows that these new galaxies form a tight group ( the individual galaxies can not be distinguished on this scale , see figure 1 for the relative positions within the group ) which in projection on the sky measures @xmath2185 kpc from sbs 1543 + 593 , significantly closer than any of the previously known higher surface brightness systems .",
    "all of these systems sit within a filament of galaxies that stretches off to the southwest of sbs 1543 + 593 .    despite living in a dense galactic environment ,",
    "these galaxies are low luminosity and low surface brightness indicating that only a small fraction of the available gas has been turned into stars .",
    "that lack of a significant amount of star - formation indicates that either the group is very young and has not had time to interact with the other galaxies or the timescales for interaction are long .",
    "the timescale that we can examine for this system is the crossing time derived from the velocity dispersion of the system . with a velocity dispersion of 132  and a size of 183 kpc ,",
    "the crossing time is 1.4@xmath18 yr .",
    "it might be expected that the tight sub - group of three neighbors  mcg+10 - 22 - 038 , dwarf 1 , and dwarf 2  is a more likely location for strong interactions , but the velocity dispersion is only 19  making the crossing time 3.3@xmath77 yr over the region s 63 kpc size . in either case",
    "the timescales are a few gyrs indicating that these may not be extremely young objects , but if this group did form at a redshift significantly less than one as this implies , some low mass , gas - rich galaxy groups may have been assembled at fairly late times .",
    "we have used the vla in c - array to map the  distribution in and around one of the nearest dlas beyond the local group , sbs 1543 + 593 .",
    "we identify 2 previously uncataloged galaxies and find a redshift for mcg+10 - 22 - 038 .",
    "all of the galaxies are found to be low luminosity , gas - rich systems with m@xmath49/l@xmath56 ranging between 0.5 and 5 .",
    "the low surface brightness of sbs 1543 + 593 , despite a large reservoir of fuel for star formation , indicates that this galaxy is young or has not undergone a strong interaction in its recent past .",
    "however , sbs 1543 + 593 is not an isolated galaxy  on both small and large scales this is a fairly high density region of the universe yet the interaction timescale with its neighbors is moderate ( 1.4 gyr ) .",
    "gas - rich , but still quiescent galaxy groups in the local universe are very hard to find because they are low luminosity systems , but they provide important information for understanding gas - accretion and star - formation processes in these systems .",
    "the accretion of cold gas onto dwarf galaxies at late times @xcite is predicted to be an important mechanism for building up gas in dwarf galaxies and theoretically it can occur without triggering a major star - formation episode .",
    "the fueling of this accretion process by gas in the intergalactic medium surrounding this group is also consistent with the observations that most of the lyman-@xmath0 absorbers , which probe the intergalactic medium , are associated with galaxy groups @xcite .    if gas - rich galaxies were more likely to form at high redshift when the density of gas in the intergalactic medium was higher , then sbs 1543 + 593 may provide important information about the environment in which many of these dlas may reside .",
    "these data also provide a warning about how easy it is to overlook dwarf galaxies even in the local universe .",
    "this is a nearby dla that was previously thought to be isolated . in the high redshift universe",
    "it becomes extremely difficult to detect galaxies like these which have luminosities that are a small fraction of l@xmath78  mcg+10 - 22 - 038 , the highest luminosity system in the group , is only @xmath20.13l@xmath79 ( adopting the value of m@xmath79 = -19.91 from @xcite ) .",
    "dlas cover a wide range of morphologies and surface brightnesses but it has become clear that low surface brightness systems are an important contributor to the population ( e.g. , @xcite ) . often low surface brightness galaxies are thought to be isolated systems because they are less strongly clustered on large scales .",
    "however , on small scales the clustering around these galaxies is less well determined especially when considering the role of gas - rich galaxies that might have been missed in optically - selected samples .",
    "learning more about the local environment of gas rich galaxies and constraining the models of gas accretion on to galaxies as well as to understand their local gaseous environments on small scales requires a better understanding of the distribution of low mass , gas - rich galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the next generation of  surveys for galaxies will provide both the sensitivity and the resolution needed to address these questions @xcite in much greater detail .",
    "the goal will be to use this improved understanding of the gas distribution surrounding local galaxies to help interpret the observations of more distant gas - rich objects identified in dla studies or by other means .",
