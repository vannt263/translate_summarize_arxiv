    "the cosmic observations of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) imply that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this implication was confirmed by the observations from cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and large scale structure @xcite .",
    "however , understanding the current accelerated expansion of our universe has become one of the most important issues of modern cosmology . in general , from the phenomenological point of view , this late time accelerated expansion of our universe is due to possible modification of gravity theory at large scale or an exotic extra energy component , dubbed dark energy , which has negative pressure .    to reveal the nature of the accelerated expansion or properties of dark energy , one needs more powerful cosmic probes . in the last decade",
    ", the data points of sn ia ( the current snu2 ) have amounted to the number @xmath3 .",
    "however , the redshift range of sn ia is relatively limited . of course , higher redshift probes are useful to describe the evolution of our universe and to reveal the nature of late time accelerated expansion of our universe and properties of dark energy .",
    "the redshift of grbs can extend to @xmath4 or higher which makes it as a complementary cosmic probe to sn ia .",
    "but before using grbs to constrain cosmological models , the grbs correlations , which relate cosmological models and intrinsic properties of grbs , should be calibrated first . in general",
    ", the grbs correlations can be written in a common form of @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the calibrated parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are related to the intrinsic properties of grbs and cosmological models , for the details please see @xcite . however ,",
    "if one calibrates the grbs correlations via a defined cosmological model , say @xmath0cdm model with @xmath10 , the resulting distance moduli of grbs are not independent of the input cosmology model . as a result",
    ", the obtained distance moduli can not be used to constrain any other cosmological models .",
    "the so - called circular problem will be committed once the above mentioned results are used to constrain any other cosmological model .",
    "based on this point , the distance modulus derived by schaefer @xcite can not be used to constrain any other cosmological models .",
    "so , new methods would be introduced to overcome this problem .",
    "li , _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite put the grbs correlation and its cosmological model constraint together as a whole to fix the calibration parameters and to obtain the best fit values of the cosmological parameters in different cosmological models via markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the lack of the grbs calibration makes the grbs weak to constrain cosmological models .",
    "in fact , the test of the correlations are needed to guarantee the consistency . in an alternative way ,",
    "cosmography method was considered in @xcite by parameterizing the luminosity distance @xmath11 in terms of deceleration parameter @xmath12 , jerk @xmath13 and snap @xmath14 parameters . clearly , the so - called circular problem is removed .",
    "however , this taylor series method is limited when it is combined with higher redshift data point to constrain cosmological models .",
    "@xcite used the low redshift sn ia to calibrate the grbs correlations and assumed the correlations were respected at high redshifts .",
    "recently , this method was reconsidered by wei @xcite .",
    "but , there would be some problems when grbs are combined with other external data sets to constrain cosmological models .",
    "wang presented a model - independent distance measurement @xmath15 ( eq . ( [ eq : rp ] ) of this paper ) from grbs calibrated internally @xcite , where @xmath16 are the redshifts of grbs .",
    "the main points of wang s method are that the resulted distance measurement @xmath15 is cosmological model in - dependent .",
    "the values of correlation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not used directly but the statistical errors of correlation parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and systematic error @xmath19 are .",
    "this is because the @xmath20 error bars of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and systematic error are almost the same in @xmath0cdm with different values of @xmath21 , though the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are different .",
    "then , the cosmic constraint from grbs is obtained in terms of a set of model - independent distance measurements .",
    "the merits of this method are listed as follows : ( i ) the constraint from grbs is in a cosmological model independent way .",
    "so , it can be used to constrain other cosmological models .",
    "( ii ) it is not calibrated by any other external data sets .",
    "it will not suffer any consistent problem when it is combined with other data sets as cosmic constraints .",
    "( iii ) the cosmological model independent calibration is done first .",
    "( iv ) though the absolute calibration of grbs is not known , the slopes of grbs correlations can be used as cosmological constraints .",
    "clearly , the drawback is clear that the constrained result is not tighter than the one calibrated by using sn ia .",
    "but , if we have enough data points of grbs , this problem will be overcome .",
    "because the slopes of grbs correlations are considered alone , this may make the grbs not very powerful .    following the method proposed by wang @xcite",
    ", xu obtained @xmath22 model - independent distances data sets and their covariance matrix by using @xmath23 grbs via amati s @xmath24 correlation @xcite .",
    "these five model - independent distances data points have been used to constrain cosmological model @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency of the obtained five data sets via amati s correlation with other cosmic probes must be checked to guarantee the reliability of grbs . with this motivation , we will test the consistency or inconsistency of snu2 with these five data sets derived from grbs via the so - called _ multi - dimensional consistency test _ which will be reviewed briefly in section [ sec : method ] , for the details please see @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : dm ] , the snu2 , the five data sets derived from grbs and the method to constrain dark energy model are presented .",
    "also , the multi - dimensional consistency test is reviewed briefly .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is the concluding remark .",

    "additionally , the observed distance moduli @xmath36 of sn ia at @xmath16 are @xmath37 where @xmath38 is their absolute magnitudes .    for the sn ia dataset , the best fit values of the parameters @xmath39 can be determined by a likelihood analysis , based on the calculation of @xmath40 - m_{obs}(z_i ) + m^{\\prime } \\right\\}^2 } { \\sigma_i^2 } , \\label{eq : chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the model parameter and @xmath42 is a nuisance parameter which includes the absolute magnitude and the parameter @xmath31 .",

    "one can find the details in ref .",
    "@xcite and the web site where the covariance matrix with or without systematic errors are included .",
    "relation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) has a minimum at the nuisance parameter value @xmath48 , which contains information of the values of @xmath31 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , one can extract the values of @xmath31 and @xmath38 provided the knowledge of one of them .",
    "finally , the expression @xmath49 which coincides to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2mar ] ) apart from a constant , is often used in the likelihood analysis @xcite .",
    "thus in this case the results will not be affected by a flat @xmath43 distribution .",
    "it is worth noting that the results will be different with or without the systematic errors . in this work ,",
    "all results are obtained with systematic errors .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the well - known amati s @xmath24 correlation @xcite in grbs , where @xmath50 is the cosmological rest - frame spectral peak energy , and @xmath51 is the isotropic energy @xmath52 in which @xmath11 and @xmath53 are the luminosity distance and the bolometric fluence of the grbs respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we rewrite the amati s relation as @xmath54    in @xcite , wang defined a set of model - independent distance measurements @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the comoving distance at redshift @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the lowest grbs redshift .",
    "then , the cosmological model can be constrained by grbs via @xmath60\\cdot(cov^{-1}_{grb})_{ij}\\cdot[\\delta\\bar{r}_p(z_i)],\\label{eq : chi2grb}\\\\ \\delta\\bar{r}_p(z_i)&=&\\bar{r}^{data}_p(z_i)-\\bar{r}_p(z_i),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rp ] ) and @xmath61 is the covariance matrix . in this way , the constraints from observational grbs data are projected into the relative few quantities @xmath62 .    following the method proposed by wang @xcite",
    ", xu obtained @xmath22 model - independent distances data sets and their covariance matrix by dividing @xmath23 grbs into five bins via amati s @xmath24 correlation @xcite .",
    "the resulting model - independent distances and covariance matrix from @xmath23 grbs are shown below in tab . [",
    "tab : distance ]    .[tab : datapoints ] distances measured from @xmath23 grbs via amati s correlation with @xmath20 upper and lower uncertainties @xcite .",

    "the consistency of sn ia and grbs is checked by the so - called _ multi - dimensional consistency test _ under the assumption that @xmath0cdm model is a correct cosmological model .",
    "we find that the inconsistency of snu2 and grbs is about @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of probability .",
    "so , we can conclude that the five grbs data points are consistent with snu2 at the level above @xmath1 .",
