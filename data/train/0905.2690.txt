    "they shine in light regions ( those spanned by relevant rays ) , burn out beside caustics ( where the ray system breaks down ) , and shut down in shadow regions ( that rays avoid ) . as a consequence ,",
    "geometrical optics is unable to account for any optical process that takes place beyond a caustic , on the dark side of it .",
    "essentials of two - dimensional geometrical optics , which are instrumental here , are outlined in appendix a.    complex - valued eikonals are more flexible .",

    "incidentally , we have also shown that solutions to the non - viscous burgers equation can be continued past the shock - line by suitable complex - valued solutions to the same equation .",
