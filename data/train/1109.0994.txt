    "( 2012 ) use an overlapping set of information both to select sources and to measure the @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 .",
    "this biases their results ( see appendix d ) , though the magnitude of this bias is mitigated by their consideration of only the brightest sources .",
    "third , one further limitation of the dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analysis is their exclusion of the lowest luminosity sources .",

    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) exclude faint sources , because their simulations suggested to them that @xmath0 could not be measured in an unbiased way . however , as we show in appendix b and d , we are able to obtain reliable measurements ( see also  4.6 ) .",

    "( 2012 ) procedure so that we could better understand what was happening with their measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in the next section .      as discussed above , a key question that has arisen in recent papers",
    "is whether it is possible to determine the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 distribution to very low luminosities with small biases .",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , in particular , have suggested that it is not possible and have supported this suggestion with a series of simulations where they add noise to model galaxies and reselect these galaxies with their photometric redshift code .",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argue that noise in the photometry combined with a preference for selecting sources with blue colors would result in highly biased estimates for the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 .",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that such a bias towards bluer @xmath13-continuum slopes at faint magnitudes is present in their mock data sets .",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argue that similar biases are likely present in lyman - break selections , without further substantiating this claim .",
    "we agree that selection biases can affect the distribution of @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 .",
    "however , the size of these selection biases is extremely dependent upon how one selects the galaxies and measures their @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 .",
    "as we show in figure  [ fig : biasdunlop ] , our lyman - break selections yield much smaller selection biases overall .",
    "the reason we expect biases in our selections to be small is that we select galaxies using a different part of the rest - frame @xmath13 sed ( the bluest two passbands redward of the break ) than we use to measure @xmath13-continuum slopes ( the second bluest passband and redder ) . as a result ,",
    "photometric scatter in the bands we use to measure the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 is largely independent of similar scatter in the bands we use for selection .",
    "therefore , we would not expect our @xmath0 measurements to be significantly biased as a result of the object selection process .-",
    "continuum slopes @xmath0 , but as we show in appendix b.1.1 these biases are small for all but the reddest @xmath0 s . ]",
    "achieving similarly small biases to faint magnitudes with a photometric redshift technique is also possible .",
    "however , one must again be careful to use different information to select sources from what one uses to measure the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 . to illustrate this",
    ", we consider the situation at @xmath3 in the current hst acs + wfc3/ir data set .",
    "we have run simulations where we attempt to measure the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 for a set of @xmath3 galaxies selected using a photometric redshift procedure .",
    "both the simulations and results are discussed in appendix d. we consider ( 1 ) the case where 5 hst bands are used to select sources and determine redshifts ( this excludes those bands used to measure @xmath0 ) , ( 2 ) the case where 6 bands are used ( and so now including one of the two bands used to measure @xmath0 ) , and ( 3 ) the case where all 7 hst bands are used for selection and redshift determination ( and so both bands used to measure @xmath0 are also included to measure redshifts and select the sources ) .",
    "this latter approach is basically what dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) do .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : dunlop ] of appendix d. while @xmath0 measurements show substantial biases when all 7 bands are used for the photometric redshift estimates ( similar to the procedure of dunlop et al .",
    "2012 ) @xmath0 measurements made using 5 or 6 bands show much smaller biases .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 can be measured with very small biases to faint magnitudes .      in an independent analysis ,",
    "finkelstein et al .  ( 2012 ) also use the recent wfc3/ir observations over the hudf and cdf - south goods field to quantify the @xmath13-continuum slope distribution for star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 - 8 .",

    "since bluer galaxies are almost always easier to select than redder galaxies in lyman - break galaxy selections , this bias would be towards bluer colors .",

    "the effect of these biases on the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 derived from the observations however are relatively modest for typical samples .",
    "for example , assuming the intrinsic distribution of @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 has a mean @xmath0 of @xmath286 and @xmath78 scatter of 0.3 ( see table  [ tab : uvslope ] ) , the bias in the mean @xmath0 is just @xmath122 for a @xmath828 mag galaxy in our @xmath4 selection .",
    "we estimate the size of this bias by starting with an initial distribution of @xmath0 s , weighting this distribution by the effective volume at each @xmath0 ( for a given magnitude ) , and then computing the shift in the biweight mean @xmath0 .",

    "while we note a bias towards bluer @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 , these biases are not extraordinarily large .",
    "similarly small selection biases are found in our other data sets , i.e. , the two other hudf09 fields , the ers field , and the cdf - south candels field .",
    "comparing the number of sources observed with a given @xmath0 with the computed selection volumes for this @xmath0 gives us another means of assessing the importance of this bias .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : betadist ] for our hudf selections , we can select sources to much redder @xmath0 s than generally observed in our selections . as in our direct estimates of the bias ( figure  [ fig : bias0c ] ) , this suggests that the selection effects are only having a modest effect on our derived @xmath0 s .",
    "we emphasize that the biases presented in this subsection and the next are simply intended to be illustrative ; more realistic estimates of the bias ( and those values of the bias we will use to correct the observations ) are presented in appendix b.2 .",
    "the intrinsic selectability of sources is not the only cause for biases in the mean @xmath13-continuum slope measurements . for many samples ,",
    "biases can arise as a result of the fact that source selection is done on the basis of the same photometric information as used for the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 measurements",
    ". this can be mildly problematic , since the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 measurements are then coupled to the selectability of a source .",
    "if errors in the photometry of a source make the source easier to select , any effect these same photometric errors have on the measured @xmath0 results in biases .",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show how significant this effect can be using their own photometric redshift selection as a reference ( figure  [ fig : biasdunlop ] ) .",
    "the size of this effect can be determined using the same simulations as described above .",
    "the measured values of @xmath0 ( after selection ) are compared with the input values of @xmath0 .",
    "differences between the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 measured for the selected galaxies and that input into the simulations is the bias . throughout we will refer to this bias as the `` photometric error coupling bias . ''    in figure",

    "strikingly , the output distribution of @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 we find is almost exactly the same as our input distribution , so it is immediately clear that biases resulting from noise are small .",
    "nonetheless , we do note a small bias in the recovered @xmath13-continuum slope distribution towards _ redder _ slopes .",
    "the explanation for both of these effects is simple .",
    "the bias is small because we use a completely different region of the @xmath13 sed ( including the two bluest rest - frame @xmath13 bands ) for selecting galaxies than we use to measure the @xmath13-continuum slope ( the second bluest @xmath13 band and redder ) .",
    "the effect of photometric scatter on the selection of sources is therefore largely independent of the effects of this scatter on @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 estimates .",
    "the bias towards redder @xmath13-continuum slopes occurs as a result of the small overlap between the bands used for selection and those used for measurement of the @xmath13-continuum slopes . since this overlapping band is the _ long _ wavelength anchor for the selection , any scatter towards fainter values makes the source bluer in the @xmath13-continuum and therefore easier to select .",
    "however , since this overlapping band is also the _ short _ wavelength anchor for @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 estimates , this same scatter towards fainter values results in _ redder _ values for the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 .      in appendix b.1 , we estimated the approximate bias in the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 we would determine from the observations .",
    "we began by estimating the bias that would result from the fact that galaxies with bluer @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 are easier to select than galaxies with redder @xmath13-continuum slopes ( appendix b.1.1 ) .",
    "we then estimated the bias we would expect in the measured values for @xmath0 as a result of the slight coupling that occurs between source selection and the measurement process ( appendix b.1.2 ) .",
    "of course , both biases affect the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 , so we need to add the above biases together to obtain the total bias in the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : bias0c ] ( _ solid lines _ ) .",
    "remarkably enough , the approximate bias in the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 is almost zero .",
    "the bias towards bluer slopes ( from the intrinsic selection biases : b.1.1 ) largely offsets the bias towards redder slopes ( from the slight coupling between source selection and @xmath0 measurements : b.1.2 ) , resulting in a very small bias overall .",
    "given the very small size of the biases expected here for our faint samples , it is certainly striking how large these same biases are for the `` robust '' photometric redshift selection of dunlop et al .",
    "figures  [ fig : biasdunlop ] and [ fig : bias0c ] provide a rather dramatic illustration of the differences .",
    "the contrast in biases is especially noteworthy , especially given the large number of candidates in our faint samples .",
    "while we can calculate the approximate effect of the aforementioned biases on @xmath0 given some input distribution , for the simulations to be accurate we must use the true underlying @xmath0 distribution for these inputs . since we are not able to establish the underlying @xmath0 distribution without first establishing the biases ( so we can apply a correction to the observed distribution of @xmath0 s ) , it was necessary to follow an iterative approach . the observed @xmath0 served as a starting point for the computation of the biases . in each iteration , we used the previous best estimate of the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 distribution to establish the relevant corrections until we obtained convergence .",
    "biases in the mean @xmath13-continuum slope were estimated in a very similar way for each of our samples ( @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath51 , and @xmath3 ) .",
    "flux measurement errors act to significantly broaden the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 distribution",
    ". the added scatter can be substantial , particularly near the selection limits for our samples .",
    "typical uncertainties on individual @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 measurements range from 0.4 to 1.0 , with the largest uncertainties being relevant for @xmath3 galaxies where only two passbands ( @xmath288 ) are available to make the measurement and the wavelength baseline is relatively short .",
    "an illustration of the extent to which these errors can increase the apparent scatter in the @xmath0 distribution can be found in bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 : figure 4 ) .    to quantify the extent to which flux measurement error ( `` noise '' ) increases the spread in the @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 distribution",
    ", we again rely on the simulations described in appendix b.1 ( see also appendix c ) . for these simulations , we assume that all galaxies have exactly the same @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 , with no scatter , and then measure the scatter in the recovered distribution . the derived @xmath78 scatter is shown in figure  [ fig : bias1 ] for @xmath4 - 7 galaxies identified in the hudf observations .",
    "scatter is largest for faint sources in each of our @xmath4 - 7 samples and also in our @xmath51 - 7 samples .",
    "scatter in our lower redshift samples is smaller because of the much larger number of passbands and longer wavelength baselines over which we use to measure the @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 ( table  [ tab : pivotbands ] and  3.3 ) .",
    "another benefit of having run these simulations is that they allow us to quantify the extent to which we can reduce the overall uncertainties in @xmath0 using the full flux information in the @xmath13 continuum , rather than using just a single color (  3.3 and appendix a ) .",
    "these gains are most dramatic for @xmath4 and @xmath19 galaxies in our fields where we use the information in four passbands ( table  [ tab : pivotbands ] ) rather than just two ( appendix a ) . in the @xmath4 or @xmath19 cases , for example",

    "is that they disappear at wavelengths bluer than @xmath81216@xmath103and are detected blueward of that in the rest - frame @xmath13 .",
    "use of five or six - band photometry to compute photometric redshifts allows us to verify that sources have this characteristic .",
    "( 2 ) selection of high - redshift sources can be improved by excluding those sources with the reddest colors redward of the break .",
    "only one color is necessary for this task . for a @xmath3 selection ,",
    "this means a 6-band @xmath303 photometric redshift selection ( the same bands are used for our @xmath3 lyman - break selection ) .",
    "adding a 7th band to the photometric redshift selection might appear to help , but actually does not , as this results in significantly biased @xmath13 slope @xmath0 measurements ( see figure  [ fig : dunlop ] ) .",
    "( 4 ) even if a small number of contaminants make it into one s samples one can mitigate the effect they have on the mean @xmath13-continuum slope @xmath0 through the use of robust statistics like the biweight mean ( see  3.5 ) .",
    "thus there appears to be few disadvantages to using an approach that minimizes the biases .",
    "the gains in measurement reliability greatly offset any potential concerns .",
    "in the interests of transparency and to facilitate comparisons with other high - redshift studies , we include a complete list of the @xmath13-continuum slopes @xmath0 that we derive for all 2518 individual sources in our @xmath4 , @xmath19 , @xmath51 , and @xmath3 samples in table  [ tab : betalist ] .",
    "we note that a small fraction ( @xmath391% ) of the sources in our samples have very red uv - continuum slopes @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath304 , and therefore may not be at high redshifts ( since this would imply that the apparent break at @xmath305 micron in their seds may not be due to absorption by neutral hydrogen , but due to their overall spectral shape ) .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that these sources have essentially no effect , i.e. , @xmath306 , on the biweight - mean @xmath0 s we report .",
