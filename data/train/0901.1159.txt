    "it is possible to trace galactic h  i  emission to the far side of the milky way , probing galactic and interstellar processes in regions of the galaxy that are inaccessible at many other wavelengths .",
    "as the dominant component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by number , h  iallows us to trace a wide variety of galactic processes including the impact of massive stars on the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "not long after the discovery of the h  i  spectral line , h  i  emission was found at velocities in excess of @xmath8 @xmath4  that could not be explained by galactic rotation @xcite . these high velocity clouds ( hvcs )",

    "hvcs are observed at both positive and negative lsr velocities with magnitudes up to @xmath9 @xmath4 .",
    "there have been extensive searches for high velocity gas ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 for a review , or recent surveys by putman et al .",
    "2002 and lockman et al .",
    "it now seems certain that hvcs represent a variety of phenomena .",
    "some hvcs may be related to a galactic fountain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "studies of the structure and distribution of high velocity gas provide critical information on the evolution of the milky way system .",
    "all - sky surveys of galactic h  i  with broad bandwidths and high spectral and angular resolution allow astronomers to simultaneously explore milky way structure , the ism and hvcs .",
    "the most recent such survey is the leiden - argentine - bonn survey ( lab ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has produced a sensitive ( @xmath10 mk ) database of the entire sky with a beam size of @xmath11 sampled on a @xmath12 grid , giving an effective resolution of @xmath13 . however , we know from high resolution studies of targeted areas of the galactic halo h  i  emission that there is a wealth of interesting structure on scales smaller than 30@xcite .",
    "for example , green bank telescope ( gbt ) results from @xcite show that the halo of the galaxy contains a significant population of small , cold clouds , possibly products of the galactic fountain , that are not detectable with the angular resolution of the lab survey .",
    "similarly , high angular and spectral resolution studies have resolved physical and spectral structure in many hvcs , giving clues to their nature @xcite . the hipass survey ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 , putman et al .",
    "2002 ) covered the sky at @xmath14 resolution , but was not designed for galactic h  i , and therefore did not accurately measure low velocity gas , nor have the velocity resolution needed to resolve interstellar h  ilines . while high angular resolution galactic plane surveys @xcite have allowed us to carefully explore galactic h  i  emission in the disk , they are not very sensitive ( @xmath15 k ) and are restricted to a few degrees around the galactic plane , leaving most of the volume of the galaxy unexplored on scales less than a degree . to fully understand the nature and origin of h  i  structure in the halo and of high velocity clouds",
    "there is a need for a sensitive , unbiased high resolution survey of the entire sky .",
    "we have made a new sensitive , fully sampled , high resolution sky survey of galactic h  i  emission south of declination @xmath16 , with the parkes 64 m radio telescope : the galactic all - sky survey ( gass ) .",
    "it was designed with the primary goals of studying the interaction of the milky way disk and halo and the nature of hvcs and intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "secondary science goals include milky way structure and the extended structure of the magellanic system . here",
    "we describe the gass project , focusing on the survey goals and techniques . in ",
    "[ sec : goals ] we describe the main design goals of the survey and the details about the observations and data reduction techniques are given in ",
    "[ subsec : obs ] and  [ subsec : data ] , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : products ] we present the data products and discuss the limitations of this first stage of our two - stage data release .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : disc ] we briefly discuss some applications of the first release data and describe some initial gass results .",
    "the parameters of the survey were chosen to match specific criteria relating to the spatial and velocity extents and velocity widths of known h  i  emission .",
    "accurate measurement of galactic h  i  at all velocities requires that the data be taken by frequency - switching , as h  i  emission , especially at @xmath17 @xmath4 , is always very extended .",
    "the survey had to cover at least @xmath18 @xmath4 , which is the range of high - velocity h  i  in the southern hemisphere @xcite . throughout this work",
    "all velocities are given in the kinematic local standard of rest ( lsrk ) , also commonly referred to simply as lsr , and defined from an average of the velocities of stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the velocity resolution had to be sufficient to measure the narrow lines ( a few @xmath4 ) found in hvc cores and disk h  i  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity goal was set to match or exceed the lab survey , but with higher angular resolution .",
    "the survey completely covers the sky with nyquist sampling so that the data can be used to provide short - spacings for interferometric imaging .",
    "gass was designed to meet these criteria by fully sampling galactic h  i  in the velocity range @xmath19 @xmath4  over the sky south of @xmath16 with angular resolution of @xmath20 and a velocity resolution of @xmath21 @xmath4 .",
    "the survey used in - band frequency - switching , described below , to maximize observing efficiency while preserving sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "integration times were chosen to achieve a brightness temperature noise ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 mk per channel thus matching the lab sensitivity for extended sources while having four times the sensitivity of the lab survey for unresolved sources .",
    "gass observations were made with the 21 cm multibeam receiver system on the parkes 64 m radio telescope .",
    "the 21 cm multibeam has 13 dual linear polarization receivers in the single cooled dewar .",
    "the 13 feed horns are arranged in a hexagonal pattern at the focal plane , consisting of a central feed , an inner ring of six feeds and an outer ring with an additional six feeds ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath24 cm , the average measured beamwidths for the multibeam are : @xmath25 for the central beam , @xmath26 for beams two to seven with an ellipticity of 0.03 , and @xmath27 for beams eight to 13 with an ellipticity of 0.06 @xcite .",
    "the mean beamwidth is therefore @xmath28 with a separation between adjacent beam centers of @xmath29 .",
    "if the receiver is oriented at an angle of @xmath30 with respect to the scan direction it produces equally spaced tracks with the inner seven beams .",
    "observations were conducted between 28 january 2005 and 1 november 2006 in eight observing sessions of typically two weeks in duration .",
    "observing sessions were organised to cover a contiguous region of the sky , usually several hours in right ascension and all declinations .",
    "all observations were conducted at night and at elevations greater than @xmath31 , which is the parkes elevation limit .",
    "gass consists of two complete surveys of the sky : one scanned in declination , one scanned in right ascension .",
    "the receiver angle was adjusted every 5  s to ensure that the individual beams of the multibeam produce approximately equally spaced tracks on the sky parallel to the scan direction .",
    "gass was designed to be fully sampled with only the inner seven beams to simplify future stray radiation corrections , but data from all 13 beams are used for the results presented here .    spectra were obtained using a special purpose correlator mode , combining the multibeam correlator and the wideband correlator to achieve 8 mhz of bandwidth divided into 2048 channels for both polarizations on all 13 beams .",
    "the data were recorded with `` in - band '' frequency - switching , in which spectra are recorded at two closely spaced frequencies ( ifs ) centered at 1418.8435 and 1421.9685 mhz with a 5  s duty cycle .",
    "frequency - switching allows one to effectively remove the continuum signal and time variations in the system gain . in - band frequency switching , where both bands contain the h  i  line , has the added benefit of maximising on - source time because the two spectra can be combined to yield a total about 4.5 mhz or 950 @xmath4  of continuous bandwidth .",
    "the channel spacing is @xmath32 @xmath4  and the effective channel width is @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "doppler tracking was not applied on - line so the lsrk velocity range accessible varies slightly for each spectrum .",
    "the frequency switch of 3.125 mhz corresponds to 660 @xmath4 , so every real emission line feature has an associated , spurious , negative image displaced by @xmath33660 @xmath4 , but most of these negative images fall outside the velocity coverage of the survey .",
    "we discuss this further in ",
    "[ sec : artifacts ] .",
    "a scan consists of all the data obtained while driving the telescope through 8 degrees of right ascension or declination at a rate of @xmath34 .",
    "it is composed of 26 independent sub - scans from the 13 beams and two polarizations with data samples every 5  s. with these scanning and sampling rates the spacing between adjacent samples is @xmath35 , which compares favourably with the nyquist sampling , @xmath36 for an observing wavelength of @xmath7 cm and the dish diameter of @xmath37 m. the separation between adjacent beam tracks with a @xmath30 receiver rotation angle is @xmath38 . for nyquist",
    "sampling interleaved scans were required .",
    "consecutive scans were offset by @xmath39 so that adjacent beam tracks were observed with different receivers .",
    "an example of the scanning pattern for three interleaved scans is shown in figure  [ fig : scanpattern ] .",
    "after three scans the spacing between adjacent tracks is @xmath40 .",
    "on - the - fly observing and subsequent gridding broadens the effective telescope beamwidth to @xmath20 .",
    "the integration time per spectrum ( pixel ) was 30 seconds for the final data product .",
    "the majority of the data reduction was carried out with _ livedata _ and _ gridzilla _ software specifically designed to process multibeam data .",
    "livedata _ performs bandpass correction and flux calibration and _ gridzilla _ produces gridded images from the calibrated , corrected data .",
    "the _ livedata _ processing pipeline was developed and used for the hipass survey as described by barnes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in its original form ,",
    "_ livedata _ derived a bandpass solution from the emission - free portions of a scan .",
    "however , neither this nor similar techniques are suitable for gass because galactic h  iemission covers the whole sky .    from its origin ,",
    "_ livedata _ established the use of robust estimation , based mainly on the use of median statistics , and this was significant in ameliorating the effects of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) in the hipass survey . for gass processing ,",
    "_ livedata _ was adapted to use similar robust techniques for bandpass calibration of frequency - switched galactic h  i  data .",
    "it works with the quotient of each frequency - switched pair , carefully masking any emission , both spectrally and in the time domain , before determining the average bandpass solution for each scan .",
    "the bandpass is calibrated separately for each beam and polarization .    in this section",
    "we describe in detail the procedures used to perform the bandpass correction for each beam and polarization , including the formation of quotient spectra , masking emission spectrally and temporally and fitting the average bandpasses .",
    "these steps are also graphically outlined in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "we first define some variables .",
    "let subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the first and second integration in pair number @xmath43 .",
    "the spectrum centred at 1418.8435 mhz is @xmath44 , and the next integration , @xmath45 , is centered at 1421.9685 mhz .",
    "the first integration , @xmath44 , is divided by @xmath45 to produce a quotient spectrum @xmath46 , and vice versa to produce @xmath47 . in general",
    "we use the variable @xmath48 to denote quotient spectra , @xmath49 to denote time averages of quotient spectra , and @xmath50 to denote estimations of the baseline , which may be medians or polynomial fits .",
    "steps in the first and second passes , as described below , are distinguished by the use of prime such as , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "considering the first in each pair of quotients , @xmath46 , a time - averaged value in emission - free regions for the eight minute scan is determined for each channel .",
    "this is ultimately fit to provide the final bandpass solution , @xmath53 .",
    "because @xmath46 and @xmath47 are reciprocals , the bandpass solution need only be computed for one or the other .",
    "much of the complexity of the algorithm relates to the identification of line emission and rfi and the construction of masks that this identification entails .",
    "these masks are determined iteratively in two passes .",
    "the first pass begins with the determination of a base level and characteristic deviation in emission - free regions .",
    "the median value over @xmath54 of @xmath46 is computed for each @xmath43 in the scan .",
    "the median of these medians then gives the _ median of quotients _",
    ", @xmath55 , a single number that provides a zeroth - order approximation to the base - level of @xmath46 over frequency and time .",
    "normally @xmath55 will be close to unity .",
    "now for each @xmath43 , we compute the median value over @xmath54 of @xmath56 .",
    "the median of these medians is the _ median quotient deviation _",
    ", @xmath57 .",
    "this is used together with @xmath55 to identify line emission or absorption when selecting data to form a time - average quotient value for each channel .",
    "thus , we consider each channel of @xmath46 in turn for all @xmath43 in the scan ; i.e.  as a function of time .",
    "we reject @xmath46 for statistical purposes if @xmath58 .",
    "the rejected @xmath46 form a _ time mask _ for the spectral channel indicating where the scan has passed through a source or encountered transient rfi .",
    "the time mask is then subjected to a broadening algorithm that aims to exclude the low - level wings of the source profile .",
    "this step recognizes that masking by means of a discriminant only accounts for the central part of an emission line or rfi .",
    "the choice of time masking broadening parameters is a careful balance between defining a mask that is too small so that the diffuse wings of sources are fit as bandpass and the source is clipped or defining a mask that is too large so that many masks merge together and the majority of a scan is masked .",
    "many values for the time mask were tested before settling on parameters such that each patch of consecutive false values ( rejected samples ) in the mask is extended by one on each side if it is at least 2 elements wide , and by a further one on each side for every additional 4 elements .",
    "thus a single isolated false value in the mask is left alone on the basis that it is probably a noise spike .",
    "isolated patches that consist of @xmath59 consecutive false values will broaden to @xmath60 samples . as the patch size increases",
    "the limiting value of the broadening factor is 150% . in this process",
    "it is not uncommon for neighbouring masked regions to blend into a single , larger masked region .",
    "an example of the first pass time - masked quotient spectrum is shown in the third panel of figure  [ fig : flowchart ] .",
    "after broadening the time mask , or even beforehand , there will usually be some channels for which too few quotients remain to compute a meaningful time - average value ; typically this occurs at low h  ivelocities .",
    "if fewer than 90% of quotients for a given channel are rejected , a first approximation to the bandpass solution for the channel , @xmath61 , is computed as the median value of those remaining .",
    "if more than 90% are rejected , then this channel is masked for the entire scan forming a _ channel mask_. channel masks are then subject to the same broadening process as the time masks , though with more aggressive broadening parameters : the mask is extended by one channel on each side for the first false value , and by a further one on each side for every additional 2 false values .",
    "thus an isolated patch of @xmath62 false values becomes @xmath63 with a limiting broadening factor of 200% .",
    "once again , these masking values were chosen as a compromise between channel masks that are so small that real emission in the line wings is included in the fit and masks that are so large that a significant fraction of the band is masked and as a consequence the fit is poorly constrained .",
    "_ livedata _ also allows for the channel mask to be augmented manually by specifying up to ten pairs of channel ranges not subject to mask broadening .",
    "a single 82 @xmath4  wide channel mask centered near 0 @xmath4  was applied to each if .",
    "broadening of the channel mask is more exaggerated than for the time mask to avoid removing spectral line wings .",
    "as they are of scientific interest , it is also important that the wings not be included in , and therefore potentially removed by , the polynomial baseline fit which is applied in the next step .",
    "channel masking results in gaps in @xmath61 which tend to coincide with channels of particular interest . at low velocities",
    "the h  i  line occupies the whole scan ; baseline information in these channels is effectively lost and can only be estimated by interpolation of neighbouring channels . in practice @xmath61 derived from observed data , and shown in figure  [ fig : passes ] , deviates by a few percent from unity .",
    "consequently we found that a robust polynomial fit of degree 15 was required to interpolate across the masked channels and fit the baseline accurately .",
    "robust polynomial fitting for gass is an iterative process whereby the polynomial is fit to the unmasked channels and points outside @xmath64 the median absolute deviation from the median are excluded from the second and final iteration . a second approximation , @xmath65 , to the bandpass solution",
    "is thus obtained , thereby completing the first pass .",
    "we found that the high order polynomial fit to @xmath61 works well for most of the sky , but for regions where the line emission is spectrally broad the fit is poorly constrained under the line .",
    "this is mainly an issue towards the galactic plane and results in errors at the 3 - 5% level as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : baseline ] .",
    "lower order polynomials were also tested but we found that they were not able to fit the substructure of the quotient spectrum .",
    "the quotients and fits for an example scan in the direction of the magellanic stream are shown in figure  [ fig : passes ] .",
    "this scan is a particularly difficult case because the galactic and magellanic stream emission are spectrally near to each other with very little spectral baseline between .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : passes ] shows the results of the first pass , where the masked , time - averaged quotient spectrum , @xmath61 , is plotted together with its polynomial fit , @xmath65 .",
    "the plotted quotient spectrum demonstrates clearly the need for the 15th degree polynomial fit .",
    "the polynomial fit in this panel is , however , not perfect , caused to a large extent by the parts of the spectral line that are not yet masked .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig : passes ] shows the results of a second pass through the data , which improves the masking of emission .",
    "the second pass essentially repeats the first pass except that @xmath55 is replaced with @xmath65 , which provides a channel - specific value .",
    "@xmath57 is recomputed accordingly but the discriminant for time masking is set at @xmath66 ( rather than @xmath67 ) because @xmath65 is a more reliable estimate of the base - level than @xmath55 .",
    "the new time average of the more effectively masked quotient spectra , @xmath68 , is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : passes ] .",
    "this spectrum is once again fit with a robust polynomial of degree 15 to give the final bandpass solution , @xmath69 , as shown in figure  [ fig : passes ] .",
    "here we can see that the more extensive masking results in a better fit to the off - line portions of the spectrum , although deviations remain at the @xmath70% level .",
    "the bandpass corrected spectra are thus calculated from @xmath69 as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 indicates normalization to unit value , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the system temperatures for the two spectra , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the median values of @xmath77 for the two frequency - switched pairs evaluated over all @xmath43 in the scan .",
    "occasional , weak , narrow - line rfi appears at a fixed topocentric frequency in much or all of some scans .",
    "once doppler - shifted to the lsrk , such rfi produces low - level features that appear to move across the sky in successive velocity channels . because of frequency - switching , such features may be negative as well as positive .",
    "narrow - line rfi appears in only one or two channels , but may cause ringing in adjacent channels .",
    "the first step in flagging rfi is to compute , for each channel , the time - average value of @xmath78 for all @xmath43 in the scan . from this , the running mean computed over 21 channels honouring the channel mask determined previously , is subtracted .",
    "the result is converted to a mask with values -1 , 0 , or + 1 , depending on whether the channel value is outside @xmath79 the median absolute deviation ; the magnitude of the departure from zero is not considered , only the sign .",
    "the mask is then scanned for non - zero channels that should be preserved , the remainder being flagged as likely rfi .",
    "consecutive non - zero channels of the same sign are preserved if there are more than 2 of them in the sequence , the _ width test _ , or if they are close to such a sequence of the same sign . here ,",
    "`` close '' means that there is no intervening value of the opposite sign , and there is no intervening sequence of consecutive zeroes of length greater than 5 channels .",
    "closeness test _ is intended to protect outliers in the wings of real emission lines .",
    "this algorithm proved effective in removing the majority of the rfi that appeared in spectral datacubes .",
    "low - level baseline residuals may remain in each spectrum at this point because the original bandpass solution was computed as a time - average over the whole scan .",
    "this residue was removed separately for each spectrum by subtracting a 10-th order polynomial fit from the spectrum for high galactic latitude areas ( @xmath80 ) and a simple median level fit from areas within 10 degrees of the galactic plane .",
    "the algorithm was as described previously , using a mask derived separately for each spectrum , including the user - defined mask as before .",
    "we discuss baseline quality in ",
    "[ subsec : quality ] .    finally , the spectra were doppler - shifted to transform them to the lsrk velocity frame for gridding and analysis .",
    "the scheme used for doppler correction was to rescale the reference frequency and channel spacing by the doppler factor , and then fourier - shift the spectrum , usually by less than one channel , so that the reference frequency was an integer factor of the original channel spacing ( 3.90625 khz ) .",
    "this scheme is employed by _ gridzilla _ ( see below ) and allows the combination of spectra taken months or years apart without requiring interpolation of the frequency axis .",
    "first order brightness calibration was applied on - line through injection of noise from a diode switched with a frequency of 500 hz .",
    "average on - line system temperatures for each beam and polarization were recorded along with each 5  s spectrum .",
    "typical system temperature values are between 21 - 23 k.    before imaging , spectra are converted to beam averaged brightness temperature , @xmath81 , from observations of the iau standard line calibration regions s6 , s8 , and s9 @xcite .",
    "one of the three standard line regions was observed each day .",
    "observations were conducted by placing each of the thirteen beams on the region in turn .",
    "the peak of the observed line was used to calculate calibration scaling factors for each beam and each polarization assuming peak brightness temperatures of @xmath82 k for s9 , @xmath83 k for s6 and @xmath84 k for s8 valid for the parkes beam @xcite .",
    "one set of calibration factors was calculated for each observing session and showed rms variations between observing sessions of @xmath85% on most beams .",
    "the notable exceptions are the second polarization on beams 10 and 12 , which were known to have unstable low noise amplifiers .",
    "the calibration factors for these beams varied by as much as 6% over the 21 months of the survey .",
    "the overall effect on the data was found to be minimal and these beams were included in the final data cubes .",
    "these brightness temperature calibration factors were applied within _ livedata _ following bandpass calibration .    to check that our calibration factors were not affected by the observing strategy of pointed calibrator observations rather than the on - the - fly scans that were used for the full survey , we observed s9 in on - the - fly mode as well .",
    "calibration factors determined from these scans were fully consistent with the factors determined from pointed observations .",
    "imaging was performed by _ gridzilla _ , a statistical gridder developed for the hipass survey and subsequently extended for more general use with parkes multibeam and other single - dish data .",
    "the algorithm is described by barnes et al .",
    "part of _ gridzilla s _ later development involved adding full support for fits celestial and spectral world coordinate systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , we used the zenithal equal - area projection ( zea ) as the most appropriate choice for mapping the hemisphere .    for each pixel in the output data cube , _ gridzilla _ computes a weight for each input spectrum based on its angular distance from the pixel . for gass",
    ", it then calculated the pixel value from the spectral values and weights using _ weighted median estimation _ , which is robust against rfi and other artifacts .",
    "the weighted median of a set of measurements is the _ middle - weight value _ - the sum - of - weights of all measurements less than it being equal to that of all measurements greater ; pro rata interpolation being used to bisect the sum - of - weights if required .    for the weighting function we used natural beam weighting , with the beam modelled by a 2d gaussian of fwhm @xmath86 , combined with an additional 2d gaussian of fwhm @xmath87 , with a cutoff radius of @xmath88 .",
    "this combination of weighting functions degrades the angular resolution of the images slightly below the telescope fwhm of @xmath86 but produces smoother and more sensitive images .",
    "measurements of unresolved sources inserted into the data prior to gridding show that the resulting resolution is @xmath2 .",
    "the primary data product for this first release is a data cube ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) of the entire survey region and full velocity range without stray radiation correction .",

    "this is determined from an image of the rms noise across the full survey region , as calculated from the median of the noise in nine blocks of @xmath102 line - free channels .",
    "the rms image is shown in figure  [ fig : rms ] .",
    "this approach effectively removes contamination of the rms measurement from negative residuals ( see   [ sec : artifacts ] ) from the magellanic system and galactic center region in the otherwise line - free channels .",
    "the noise is relatively smooth across the majority of the sky , with a mode of @xmath103 mk . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] , the rms around the galactic plane region is clearly higher than the rest of the sky .",
    "this is due to both strong continuum sources and the large fraction of the band filled by h  iemission in the galactic plane .",
    "both effects raise the system temperature .",
    "similar increases in rms occur in the region of the lmc .",
    "the rms is lower in the overlap region between scans and also where scans were repeated , such as the large area near 1 h of right ascension . assuming a rms brightness temperature of @xmath5 mk , the @xmath22 column density noise in a single velocity channel is @xmath104 . for a typical hvc of width 30 @xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath105 sensitivity limit is @xmath106 .",
    "there are three extended areas where portions of the spectra in the range velocities @xmath107 @xmath4  have increased noise by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "these regions result from two days worth of ra scans that were flagged because they exhibited nearly continuous , broadband rfi of unknown origin .",
    "the flagged scans lie in the regions : @xmath109 , @xmath110 ; @xmath111 , @xmath112 ; and @xmath113 , @xmath114",
    ". these areas are marginally visible in figure  [ fig : rms ] as regions of increased noise .",
    "a fundamental limitation of gass data in the present release is stray radiation : h  i  emission that enters the receiver from the sidelobes of the telescope rather than through the main beam .",
    "@xcite has shown that stray radiation can make a significant contribution ( 15  50% of the profile area ) to observed galactic h  i  emission profiles , mostly at high galactic latitudes where emission in the primary beam is weak .",
    "the lab survey has been corrected for stray radiation , and the second gass data release will be corrected as well , but at this stage we have simply estimated the total amount stray radiation in gass for various regions of the sky .",
    "this was done by convolving the gass and lab surveys to @xmath115 angular resolution , computing the total column density over their common velocity range ( @xmath116 @xmath4 ) , and interpreting the difference as stray radiation in gass .",
    "figure  [ fig : stray ] shows the convolved gass column density , the estimated stray column , and the stray fraction . for most lines of sight the fraction of the total column density believed to arise from stray radiation is between 5 and 15% , with some particularly low column density regions showing fractions as high as 35% .    to demonstrate the spectral behaviour of the stray radiation component we compared lab and gass spectra towards several regions representative of high stray radiation fraction , low stray fraction , and average stray fraction , as calculated above .",
    "the regions are marked on figure  [ fig : column_annotate ] and the spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec1 ] .",
    "these spectra are averaged over @xmath117 degrees in both surveys to minimize any resolution - dependent effects . for an area with average stray fraction",
    "it is clear that the gass spectrum reproduces the stray radiation corrected lab spectrum very well , with small departures in the line wings where the total intensity is small .",
    "the high stray fraction spectrum was extracted towards a region where the fraction of the total column density attributed to stray radiation was on the order of 30% . in this area",
    "the gass spectrum has a very low peak brightness temperature of @xmath118 k , and yet the lab spectrum peak is even lower at @xmath119 k. the gass spectrum also shows significant effects of stray radiation in the line wings .",
    "although gass spectral baselines are generally very good , there are residual ripples in the final baselines with maximum peak - to - peak variations of @xmath120 mk .",
    "it was the presence of much larger ( @xmath121 mk ) bandpass amplitude ripples and striping in test images that necessitated the use of high - order polynomials in the bandpass correction algorithm as described in ",
    "[ sec : details ] .",
    "these were effectively removed by the post - bandpass polynomial fits applied to scans away from the galactic plane . to ensure that the high - order polynomials had not subtracted real emission we compared spectra obtained from gass to spectra obtained from the lab survey .",
    "these showed generally very good agreement at the @xmath122 mk level .",
    "several examples are shown in figure  [ fig : spec_comparison ] , demonstrating the baseline quality of gass .",
    "baseline quality deteriorates in some regions toward the galactic plane and the magellanic clouds .",
    "the bandpass correction method described in  [ subsubsec : bandpass ] is limited in cases where the h  i  emission in the quotient spectrum fills @xmath120% of the band . in these cases the polynomial fit to the quotient spectrum",
    "is poorly constrained and therefore the bandpass under the line is not well determined .",
    "this results in some small , @xmath123% , baseline errors where the measured line temperatures can appear either too large or too small relative to spectra from lab .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig : spec3 ] , where the gass spectra show higher and lower peak values than lab .      as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : obs ] , the in - band frequency - switching will produce a negative copy of a spectral line displaced by @xmath33660 @xmath4 . as a practical matter ,",
    "most of these artifacts lie outside the final data cube , but there are some notable exceptions for features at @xmath124 @xmath4  ( with the inverted feature appearing at negative velocities ) and @xmath125 @xmath4  ( at positive velocities ) .",
    "this is particularly evident towards the galactic center , the magellanic clouds ( apparent at extreme negative velocities ) and the northern tip of the magellanic stream ( apparent at extreme positive velocities ) as can be seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spec3 ] .",
    "another artifact appears as a low amplitude grid - like scanning pattern in channel images with low - level emission .",
    "this is due to residual ripples in the bandpass of individual scans , which can cause slight offsets between adjacent scans .",
    "these are typically within the noise , but because they are spatially correlated they can be seen in the rms image in figure  [ fig : rms ] .",
    "the parkes galactic all - sky survey ( gass ) is a high spectral and angular resolution h  i  line survey of the sky south of @xmath126 .",
    "the first - stage data release includes a full cube at @xmath20 angular resolution , @xmath3 @xmath4  spectral resolution and @xmath101 mk rms noise over the velocity range @xmath127 .",
    "spectra from this cube and several other data products are now publicly available at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/gass .",
    "table  [ tab : compare ] gives a comparison of gass with other large - scale surveys of galactic h  i. at southern declinations gass is unsurpassed in sensitivity and , outside of the galactic plane , in angular and velocity resolution .",
    "the improvement of gass over the lab survey is illustrated by the spectra in figure  [ fig : spec_comparison ] , shown at the full angular resolution of both surveys .",
    "the current release of gass is intended to provide data that are ideal for study of high velocity ( @xmath8 @xmath4 ) h  i , where the effects of stray radiation are negligible , and small - scale features , where the angular resolution is a significant advance .",
    "a complete catalog of hvcs and ivcs from gass is in preparation by d.  j.pisano et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) . because the current data release has not been corrected for stray radiation , care should be taken when using it to derive global milky way properties , especially at low column densities where there can be significant amounts of stray radiation . for users interested in total column densities measured to extragalactic sightlines",
    "these measurements should be considered in conjunction with the total fraction of the column due to stray radiation ( figure  [ fig : stray ] ) .",
    "gass data have already been used for several of the scientific areas described in  [",
    "sec : intro ] : using data from the first year of observations @xcite found that one of the largest galactic supershells , gsh 24203 + 37 , is in fact a chimney , with evidence for breakout on both sides of the galactic plane .",
    "gsh 24203 + 37 appears capped by thin , clumpy filaments of h  i  emission at heights of @xmath128 kpc above the galactic midplane .",
    "those authors suggested that the clumpy filaments may be the precursor of halo clouds detected by @xcite .",
    "ford et al .  (",
    "2008 ) used gass data to extend our knowledge of galactic halo clouds by constructing a catalogue of hundreds of clouds in a @xmath129 gass pilot region centred on @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "though restricted to a small range of galactic longitudes , they found that the distribution of clouds is significantly peaked at a galactocentric radius of 3.75 kpc and that the clouds are associated with loops and filaments consistent with a chimney origin as suggested for gsh 24203 + 37 .",

    "( 2009 , in preparation ) will further explore the galactic distribution of these clouds .    finally ,",
    "@xcite have used gass data to study the interaction of an hvc in the magellanic leading arm with the galactic disk .",
    "they showed that the leading arm crosses the milky way disk at a galactocentric radius of 17 kpc , which is close to the interaction region predicted in older models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) of the magellanic system but somewhat surprising given the revised proper motions for the large and small magellanic clouds @xcite .    as a new , sensitive survey of galactic h  i",
