    "phase transitions in elementary particle physics have been studied over the last two decades in various contexts .",
    "the phase transitions of grand unified theories may lead to inflationary periods of the early universe @xcite ; the electroweak phase transition can be based on a theory whose parameters - up to the higgs sector - are meanwhile well known and studies both in perturbation theory @xcite and on the lattice @xcite show considerable progress in its understanding .",
    "the hadronic phase transition is being investigated both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "for some applications it is sufficient to work in finite temperature quantum field theory , i. e. to consider only states of thermal equilibrium . for the inflationary phase transition ,",
    "at least , a real time study involving nonequilibrium dynamics is necessary if one intends to describe the process of reheating . the simplest version of the inflationary scenario which consists in introducing a friction term @xcite has been shown recently @xcite to be on weak theoretical grounds .",
    "linear and nonlinear relaxation have therefore been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "the one - loop relaxation equations studied here do not seem to lead to a proper thermalization , presumably they have to be modified in such a way as to include the interactions among the fluctuating fields .",
    "however , they will certainly describe an initial stage of a more involved dynamical development .",
    "they present therefore a first step that has to be studied and well understood .",
    "another subject to which nonequilibrium dynamics has been applied recently is the hadronic phase transition @xcite and the possible formation of disordered chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "the computations of the nonlinear relaxation equations requires regularization and renormalization .",
    "thus far @xcite noncovariant momentum cutoffs were used in such computations . while it would certainly not be an essential difficulty to replace those by a pauli - villars type regularization one may wish , in computations involving nonabelian gauge theories , to be able to use dimensional regularization as well .",
    "furthermore it is more convenient to compute only convergent integrals instead of dealing with divergent integrals by varying their cutoff .",
    "it is the aim of this work to present a computational method in which the process of regularization and renormalization is cleanly separated from the numerical computation of finite parts of the one - loop integrals .",
    "the method is similar to the one developed in @xcite which has been applied for the computation of one loop contributions to reaction rates associated with sphalerons @xcite , instantons @xcite and bounces @xcite . while in the cases mentioned the computations involved euclidean green functions which are behaved smoothly , here we will have to compute the trace of a green function in minkowski space , i. e. involving real time .",
    "the oscillating behaviour of such green functions could present a new difficulty for the application of the computational scheme .    in this first presentation of the method",
    "we have studied its practical numerical application only in the simplest possible model , a scalar field theory with a @xmath1 self interaction .",
    "this theory has also been the subject of previous studies @xcite and the results are similar .",
    "especially it is found that the parametric resonance implied by an oscillating background field does not fully develop ; back reaction damps the classical amplitude and the system relaxes to a new , essentially stationary oscillating phase .",
    "the plan of this work is as follows : in section [ basics ] we recall the basic definitions and relations ; in section [ equ_mot ] we present the one - loop nonlinear relaxation equations ; we prepare the regularization in section [ pertex ] by expanding the fluctuation modes in orders of the vertex function governed by the classical field and by deriving the large momentum behaviour of the first terms ; regularization is then straightforward , the renormalization requires some algebra , both are presented in section [ renorm ] ; the formalism is extended , in section [ emt ] , to the renormalization of the energy - momentum tensor ; the numerical computation is discussed in section [ num_an ] ; we conclude in section [ conclus ] with a discussion of the numerical results and an outlook to more realistic and more general applications of the method .",
    "we restrict our study to self - interacting scalar @xmath0-theory without spontaneous symmetry breaking .",

    "since we are dealing with a nonequilibrium system the appropriate expansion is the ctp formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider the zero temperature case only .",
    "the green function is defined by a @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 where @xmath14 here the brackets @xmath15 refer to an expectation value with respect to the density matrix @xmath16 .",

    "the function @xmath69 is identical to the function @xmath59 itself which is obtained by solving ( [ fdiffeq ] ) , the function @xmath70 can be obtained as @xmath71 or by solving the inhomogeneous differential equation @xmath72 note that in this way one avoids the computation of @xmath70 via the small difference @xmath73 .",
    "this feature is especially important if deeper subtractions are required as in the case of fermion fields .",
    "the order on the potential @xmath64 will determine the behaviour of the functions @xmath68 at large momentum .",
    "we will give here the relevant leading terms for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "can be easily extendend @xcite to coupled channel systems and higher orders in the expansion ( if deeper subtractions are required ) .",

    "as discussed in section 3 the computation of the fluctuation term @xmath150 which determines the back - reaction of the quantum fluctuations to the classical field @xmath27 can be reduced to the computation of the mode functions @xmath151 and @xmath70 via ( [ numerik ] ) .",

    "the momentum integrals are finite ; however , the convergence is not very good , as the integrand decreases only as an inverse power of @xmath152 .",

    "a delicate part of the momentum integration is the region of small momenta .",
    "there the mode functions develop a parametric resonance before their back - reaction to the classical field @xmath27 suppresses the amplitude of the latter one and the system `` shuts off '' @xcite , i. e. reaches a stationary oscillating behaviour .",

    "the quality of the numerical procedure was monitored by the conservation of energy which was fulfilled with an accuracy of better than @xmath161 . with the accuracy given above we had to compute the mode functions for @xmath162 values of momentum .",
    "the computations can be performed on a modern pc or small workstation , they take then several hours of cpu time .",
    "we have presented here a computational scheme for solving the one - loop nonlinear relaxation equations with a manifestly covariant regularization and renormalization .",
    "the results are presented in figs . 3 - 9 for two sets of parameters , similar to those of @xcite : @xmath163 ( as the general unit ) and @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and   [ fig8 ] we display the classical amplitude @xmath27 , in figs .  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig9 ] we show the growth of the fluctuation integral @xmath166 ( see ( [ numerik ] ) ) .",

    "the amplitude of the integrand is seen to fall off as @xmath169 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot the classical and fluctuation energies as well as the total energy for the first parameter set .",

    "these numerical results show the same qualitative and similar quantitative features as those obtained in @xcite .",
    "an initial large amplitude oscillation leads after a short time interval - depending on the initial amplitude - to a strong excitation of the low momentum fluctuation modes as expected from a parametric resonance . then after a considerable decrease of the classical amplitude an essentially stationary oscillating regime is reached .",
    "in contrast to a computation in hartree - approximation in @xcite we find that even for @xmath172 a considerable amount of energy is transferred to the fluctuation modes . the main difference between a small and large initial value of the classical field",
    "consists in the time that is needed for the fluctuations to build up .",
    "the field theory we have considered here was a rather simple one ; as discussed in @xcite one would not expect the one - loop approximation to be a good here nor has the system been found previously to display thermalization . here",
    "this simple model served as a toy example for demonstrating the method .",
    "more interesting systems are of course gauge theories with many light degrees of freedom . there the differential equations for the gauge field fluctuations form coupled systems .",
    "we should like to stress that the method as developed in sections [ pertex ] and [ renorm ] can be easily generalized to deal with such coupled channel systems .",
    "this generalization is entirely analoguous to the treatment of coupled channel one loop computations in @xcite .",
