    "the next step , a thirty - jet experiment to form spherically imploding plasma liners that reach 0.11  mbar of peak pressure at stagnation , has been designed@xcite but not yet fielded . the primary objective of the single - jet propagation and two - jet oblique merging studies is to obtain critical experimental data in order to ( 1 )  uncover important unforeseen issues and ( 2 )  provide inputs to and constraints on numerical modeling efforts aimed at developing predictive capability for the performance of imploding spherical plasma liners .",
    "this study focuses on addressing issues for the potential use of railgun - driven high-@xmath0 plasma jets for forming imploding spherical plasma liners and the ability to reach hed - relevant stagnation pressures ( @xmath10  mbar ) .",
    "thus , we are interested not only in the jet parameters as they exit the railgun , but also in the evolution of the plasma jet as it propagates a distance of @xmath11  m , as this evolution will affect subsequent jet merging and ultimately the plasma liner formation and implosion processes . as such",

    "here , we provide a brief summary of the steps in imploding plasma liner formation using an array of merging plasma jets .",
    "much more detailed accounts , including both theoretical and computational results , have been presented elsewhere.@xcite    first , multiple plasma jets are launched radially inward from the periphery of a large spherical vacuum chamber .",
    "the jets propagate separately until they coalesce at the merging radius @xmath12 , which depends on the jet @xmath0 , the number of jets @xmath13 , the initial jet radius @xmath14 , and the chamber radius @xmath15 . for non - varying @xmath0 and",
    "the assumption of a jet radial expansion speed of @xmath16,@xcite where @xmath17 is the ion sound speed and @xmath18 is the polytropic index , @xmath12 has been derived as@xcite @xmath19 note that as @xmath20 ( _ i.e. _ , no radial jet expansion ) , @xmath21 . for plx - relevant values",
    "( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24  cm , @xmath25  cm , @xmath26 ) , @xmath27  cm , meaning that the jets will propagate about 60  cm before merging with adjacent jets .",
    "the reduced value of @xmath26 ( below the ideal gas value of @xmath28 ) is used throughout the paper to approximate the internal degrees of freedom of an argon plasma , _ i.e. _ , due to ionizations and excitations.@xcite if @xmath0 increases during jet propagation due to radiative cooling , then eq .  ( [ eq : r_m ] ) overestimates @xmath12 and underestimates the jet propagation distance before merging .",
    "nevertheless , for plx , we are interested in jet propagation distances of order 0.5  m. characterizing the evolution of jet parameters over that distance is the focus of this paper .",
    "adjacent jets merge at oblique angles at @xmath12 to form an imploding spherical plasma liner . for plx",
    ", the jet merging angles are determined by the vacuum chamber port positions , with nearest neighbor jets meeting at @xmath29 . even at this angle ,",
    "two adjacent jets , each with @xmath22 , meet with a relative mach number of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , shock formation and associated heating may be expected to contribute significant non - uniformities to the plasma liner formation process .",
    "the strength of the shock , and indeed whether shocks even form , are open research questions due to the parameter regime of our jets,@xcite _ i.e. _ , the plasma within each jet is highly collisional ( argon ion mean free path @xmath31  cm compared to the jet diameter of 520  cm , where @xmath32  @xmath2 , @xmath33  ev , and mean charge state @xmath34 have been used to estimate @xmath35 ) but the interaction between two jets is semi - collisional or even collisionless ( due to the high relative velocity between the jets ) on the scale of the jet diameter .",
    "shock heating , should it occur , may degrade the implosion mach number , which would lead to the undesirable result of lower liner stagnation pressure.@xcite the non - uniformities introduced by discrete jet merging may lead to asymmetries in the plasma liner implosion that significantly degrade the peak achievable stagnation pressures . these and other issues relating to plasma liner formation via discrete merging plasma jets have been studied theoretically@xcite and computationally@xcite elsewhere and are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "experimental results from plx on two - jet oblique merging will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally , after all the jets merge into an imploding spherical plasma liner , the liner converges with mass density @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mass density at @xmath12 and @xmath38 is the radial position of the imploding liner.@xcite this results in the convergent amplification of liner ram pressure until the liner reaches the origin and stagnates ( for targetless liner implosions ) , converting the liner kinetic energy into stagnation thermal energy and excitation / ionization energy of the liner plasma.@xcite an outward - propagating shock is launched , and when this shock meets the trailing edge of the incoming liner , the entire system disassembles after a stagnation time @xmath39,@xcite where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the initial jet length and velocity , respectively .",
    "there are several issues relating to jet propagation that are important for determining the performance of the subsequent liner formation , implosion , and stagnation .",
    "assessing these issues experimentally is the primary motivation for this single - jet study . in all cases ,",
    "the experimental results are intended to improve the predictive capability of imploding spherical plasma liner modeling .",
    "the first issue is the achievement of the requisite jet parameters for reaching the desired liner stagnation pressure .",
    "the design goal for plx is to reach 0.11  mbar with a total liner kinetic energy of about 375  kj .",
    "a 3d ideal hydrodynamic simulation study@xcite exploring a wide parameter space in plasma jet initial conditions contributed to the plx reference design calling for thirty argon plasma jets with initial density @xmath42  @xmath2 , velocity @xmath43  km / s , and mass @xmath44  mg .",
    "the simultaneous achievement of these parameters has recently been demonstrated at hyperv technologies , to be reported elsewhere . for this paper , we operated at reduced values to extend the lifetime of the railgun and maximize the number of shots .",
    "the second issue is the evolution of jet parameters , especially density and velocity , during propagation .",
    "developing an accurate predictive capability for modeling plasma liner formation via merging jets requires accurate knowledge of these jet parameters , both at the exit of the railgun as well as at @xmath12 .",
    "the jet velocity is expected to remain nearly constant , but density decay arises from jet radial and axial expansion .",
    "the third issue is the nature of the jet radial and axial profiles because they are important for accurate modeling of the jet merging and liner formation / implosion processes .",
    "experimental values ( presented in sec .  [ results ] ) allow the jet expansion to be estimated . in a purely hydrodynamic treatment",
    "in which the jet has a non - varying @xmath0 , both the radial and axial expansion speeds of the jet can be estimated to be between @xmath17 ( jet bulk ) and @xmath16 ( jet edges).@xcite for argon at @xmath45  ev and @xmath26 , these values are 2.2  km / s and 11  km / s , respectively .",
    "if the jet travels at 30  km / s over a distance of 50  cm , this gives a transit time of 16.7  @xmath9s , during which the jet radius will increase by 3.716.7  cm and the jet length by 7.433.4  cm .",
    "for a jet with @xmath24  cm and @xmath46  cm , the jet volume will increase by a factor of 8.4157.5 , and the density will drop by the same factor . due to the nearly factor of twenty uncertainty in",
    "the theoretically predicted density decay , and the fact that jet cooling due to expansion and radiative losses ( and thus a varying rate of expansion ) are not accounted for in the above treatment , it is imperative to determine the density decay by direct experimental measurement .",
    "experiments on plx are conducted in a 9  ft .",
    "( 2.74  m ) diameter stainless steel spherical vacuum chamber , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ plx - schematic](a ) , situated in a 3000  ft.@xmath47 ( 279  m@xmath47 ) high - bay space with a ten - ton overhead crane .",
    "the vacuum chamber has 60 smaller ports ( 11  in .",
    "outer and @xmath48  in .",
    "inner diameters ) and 10 larger ports ( 29.5  in .  outer and 23.5  in .",
    "inner diameters ) ; all flanges are aluminum .",
    "we presently have two operational plasma railguns ( see sec .  [ railgun ] for railgun specifications ) installed on the vacuum chamber to study high-@xmath0 single - jet propagation , two - jet oblique merging , and two - jet head - on merging .",
    "this paper reports only single jet results .",
    "the vacuum base pressure is typically in the low-@xmath49  torr range , achieved with a turbo - molecular pump ( 3200  l / s leybold mag w 3200c , @xmath50  in.pumping diameter ) backed by an oil - free mechanical pump ( edwards iqdp 80 ) . during each experimental shot ,",
    "the turbo - pump is isolated by closing a gate valve , and thus the vacuum pressure is in the 530  @xmath9torr range when a plasma jet is fired into the chamber . the pressure in the chamber after a shot is in the 0.3-to - few mtorr range ; the gate valve is opened and the chamber evacuated prior to the next shot .",
    "all chamber pressures are recorded using an mks 972b dualmag transducer . a labview - based ( ` http://www.ni.com/labview ` ) 40  mhz field programmable gate array ( fpga ) system controls safety interlocks , shot sequence including bank charging and dumping , and all trigger signals .",
    "sensitive control and data acquisition electronics reside within an electromagnetically shielded cage or other shielded racks .",
    "all time - series data shown in this paper were digitized at 40  mhz sampling rate , 12-bit dynamic range , and 1  mv bit resolution ( by joerger model tr digitizers ) .",
    "all times reported in the paper are relative to the trigger time of the gun rails .",
    "experimental data and shot data are immediately stored into an mdsplus ( ` http://www.mdsplus.org ` ) database after every shot .      to achieve the design objectives of plx ( _ i.e. _ , 0.11  mbar of peak liner stagnation pressure using thirty plasma jets with total implosion kinetic energy of @xmath51  kj ) within budgetary constraints , two - stage parallel - plate railguns ( see fig .  [ gun - schematics ] ) , designed and fabricated by hyperv technologies corp.,@xcite were selected as the plasma gun source for forming and launching jets with the requisite parameters ( jet density @xmath42  @xmath2 , velocity @xmath43  km / s , and mass @xmath44  mg ) .",
    "the development , optimization , and performance scaling results of these plx railguns , as well as the simultaneous experimental achievement of the aforementioned jet parameters , will be reported elsewhere .",
    "note that larger coaxial guns with shaped electrodes@xcite are also being developed due to their suitability for very high current ( @xmath52  ma ) and high jet velocity ( @xmath53  km / s ) operation , and for having attributes that minimize impurities , as potentially required for the mif application .",
    "the railgun bore cross - sectional area is @xmath54  cm@xmath47 .",
    "the gun has a fast gas - puff valve ( gv ) , a pre - ionizer ( pi ) , hd-17 ( tungsten alloy ) rails housed in a noryl ( blend of polyphenylene oxide and polystyrene ) clamshell body , zirconium toughened alumina ( zta ) insulators between the rails , and a cylindrical acrylic nozzle ( 5  cm diameter and 19  cm length ) .",
    "the results reported here are from shots with an underdamped , ringing , and slowly decaying gun current ( fig .",
    "[ i - v ] ) that produces multiple jet structures , with the leading structure having a length of order 20  cm .",
    "we use ultra - high - purity argon ( typically at 1820  psig ) for the gas injection , injecting an average total mass of about 35  mg in each shot for the data set presented in this paper ( but only a small fraction of the total injected mass is contained in the leading jet structure ) .",
    "the railgun firing sequence is gv followed by the pi and finally the rails .",
    "the time delays are all adjustable and are chosen for optimizing certain aspects of jet performance such as density , velocity , or mass . for the shots reported here",
    ", the gv is fired 300  @xmath9s before the gun rails so that neutral argon fills the pi volume and the very rear of the railgun bore .",
    "the pi is fired 30  @xmath9s before the gun rails to break down the neutral gas , giving the pi plasma just enough time to fill the very rear of the railgun bore .",
    "then the rails are fired to accelerate the pi plasma down the bore .",
    "control over the plasma jet density and mass is mainly through the feed line pressure , gv bank voltage , and timing of the neutral gas puff ; control over the jet velocity is mainly through the railgun current and charge voltage . for single - gun operation , the gun , pi , and gv",
    "are driven by 36  @xmath9f , 6  @xmath9f , and 24  @xmath9f capacitor banks , respectively , charged typically to -24  kv , 20  kv , and 8  kv , respectively .",
    "the 36 and 6  @xmath9f banks use 60-kv , 6-@xmath9f maxwell model 32184 capacitors , and the 24-@xmath9f bank uses a single 50-kv maxwell model 32567 capacitor .",
    "all banks are switched by spark - gap switches triggered via optical fibers .",
    "details about the gun design , operation , performance scaling , and best achieved parameters will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we have evidence that the plasma jet is not 100% argon .",
    "we observe an approximately 25% higher pressure rise in the chamber ( for the data set presented in this paper ) when the gv and railgun are both fired , compared to when only the gv is fired .",
    "the pressure discrepancy is most likely explained by the railgun current ablating material from the hd-17 rails and possibly also the zta insulators .",
    "we also observe hydrogen , oxygen , and aluminum impurity spectral lines , and potentially others that have not yet been identified ( with tungsten , nickel , iron , and copper from the rails as likely candidates ) . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we have assumed that the plasma jets are 100% argon for the purpose of interpreting the experimental data because the error introduced is generally small compared to diagnostic measurement uncertainties .",
    "impurity control in plasma jets is clearly an important issue for the mif standoff driver application and requires further study .",
    "plasma jet diagnostics include an eight - chord interferometer , a visible and near - infrared ( ir ) survey spectrometer , an array of three photodiode detectors , and an intensified ccd ( charge - coupled device ) imaging camera .",
    "details of each plasma jet diagnostic system are given below .",
    "figure  [ exp - setup ] shows the diagnostic views in relation to the plasma jet propagation path .",
    "a discussion of the entire planned plx diagnostic suite is described in more detail elsewhere.@xcite we emphasize that all plasma jet diagnostic measurements are averaged quantities over their viewing - chords , and therefore we report mostly sight - line - averaged quantities .",
    "diagnostics for the railgun and pulsed - power systems include rogowski coils ( for monitoring railgun , gv , and pi discharge currents ) , pearson current monitors ( model 2877 ) on parallel resistors ( for monitoring instantaneous capacitor bank voltages ) , and five magnetic probe coils along the railgun bore ( for monitoring electrical current propagation down the bore ) . figure  [ i - v ] shows representative gun current @xmath56 , gun voltage @xmath57 , and the gun bore current @xmath58 from the rearmost gun bore magnetic probe .",
    "an eight - chord fiber - coupled interferometer was designed and constructed for the plx project.@xcite the system uses a 561  nm diode - pumped , solid - state , 320  mw laser ( oxxius 561 - 300-col - pp - las-01079 ) with a long coherence length ( @xmath59  m ) .",
    "along with the use of single - mode fibers ( thorlabs 460hp ) to transport the laser beams to and from the vacuum chamber , this allows for the use of one reference chord for all eight probe chords , as long as length mismatches between reference and probe chords are much smaller than the coherence length .",
    "the fiber - coupling allows for relatively simple chord re - arrangements at launch and reception optical bread boards mounted on the vacuum chamber .",
    "the beam - splitting and combination optics on the main optical table do not need to be altered to re - arrange chords .",
    "large borosilicate windows are used on both the launch and reception chamber ports .",
    "for this paper , the eight laser probe beams ( 3  mm diameter at the plasma jet ) were arranged transversely to the direction of jet propagation at different distances from the railgun nozzle : @xmath6079.5  cm at equal intervals of approximately 6.35  cm ( see fig .",
    "[ exp - setup ] ) .",
    "the bragg cell for the interferometer uses a radio frequency generator ( intraaction me-1002 ) that produces a 110  mhz signal .",
    "the output signal from the final photo - receivers are passed through bandpass filters ( lark engineering mc110 - 55 - 6aa ) at @xmath61  mhz to filter out higher - frequency components of the heterodyne mixing and lower - frequency electrical noise .",
    "the filtered signal is decomposed into two signals , i and q , proportional to the sine and cosine of the signal , respectively .",
