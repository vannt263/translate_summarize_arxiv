    "macroscopic quantum tunneling is a topic of interest that pertains to the boundaries between quantum and classical physics .",
    "this field has undergone extensive research in recent years as experimental advances have made possible the observation of quantum tunneling effects in some macroscopic quantum variables such as the flux quantum transitions in a superconducting quantum interference device , or the decay of a zero - voltage state in a current - biased josephson junction @xcite .",
    "macroscopic quantum systems may be modelled by open quantum systems which are characterized by a distinguished subsystem , described by suitable degrees of freedom which are subject to physical experimentation , within a larger closed quantum system .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the remaining system are not subject to experimental observation and act as an environment or bath for the distinguished subsystem , which is usually referred to as the `` system '' for short .",
    "the environment acts as a source of dissipation and noise for the system and produces quantum decoherence .",
    "caldeira and leggett in two influential papers @xcite considered the effect of dissipation on the tunneling rate and noted that dissipation always suppresses tunneling ; see also ref .",
    "this work was then extended to many other open quantum systems with different system - environment couplings , and different potentials for the field @xcite ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews .",
    "most work on macroscopic quantum tunneling is based on imaginary time formalisms such as the euclidean functional techniques which have been introduced in the classical field of noise - activated escape from a metaestable state @xcite , or the instanton approach introduced for quantum mechanical tunneling or for vacuum decay in field theory @xcite .",
    "these techniques are specially suited for equilibrium or near equilibrium situations , but can not be generalized to truly non equilibrium situations . to be able to deal with out of equilibrium situations we need a real time formalism which describes the evolution of the quantum system by means of true dynamical equations .",
    "there are theoretical and practical reasons for a formalism of nonequilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling . on the theoretical side dissipation , for instance ,",
    "is only truly understood in a dynamical real time formalism . in the classical context thermal activation from metaestable states",
    "is well understood since kramers @xcite in terms of the dynamical fokker - planck transport equation , where the roles of dissipation and noise and their inter - relations are known . on the other hand ,",
    "an open quantum system may be described by a dynamical equation for the reduced density matrix , the so - called master equation , or the equivalent equation for the reduced wigner function which has many similarities to the fokker - planck equation .",
    "however , at present no compelling derivation of the tunneling rate is available in this dynamical framework , that might be compared to the instanton approach for equilibrium systems .",
    "consequently , the effect of dissipation , noise and decoherence on tunneling and their inter - connections is not yet fully understood .",
    "on the practical side out of equilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling is becoming necessary to understand arrays of josephson junctions , or time - dependent traps for cold atoms which are proposed for storing quantum information in future quantum computers @xcite , or to understand first order phase transitions in cosmology @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a formulation of macroscopic quantum tunneling based on the reduced wigner function . in recent years",
    "we have considered different scenarios in which metaestable quantum systems are described by the master equation for the reduced wigner function . by using techniques similar to those used for thermal activation processes on metastable states @xcite we were able to compute the contribution to the quantum decay probability due to the environment .",
    "this was used in some semiclassical cosmological scenarios for noise induced inflation @xcite due to the back reaction of the inflaton field , in the context of stochastic semiclassical gravity @xcite ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews on this subject .",
    "it was also used for bubble nucleation in quantum field theory , where the system was described by the homogeneous mode of the field of bubble size and the environment was played by the inhomogeneous modes of the field @xcite , and on some simple open quantum systems coupled linearly to a continuum of harmonic oscillators at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "but in all these problems only the contribution to tunneling due to activation was considered .",
    "the reason is that the non harmonic terms of the potential that induce the pure quantum tunneling of the system lead to third and higher order momentum derivatives of the reduced wigner function in the master equation .",
    "one has to resort to numerical methods such as those based on matrix continued fractions in order to compute decay rates from master equations in this case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are able to deal simultaneously with both contributions , namely pure quantum tunneling and thermal activation , to the vacuum decay process using the master equation for the reduced wigner function .",
    "the computational innovation that makes this possible is the introduction of a representation of the reduced wigner function based on the energy wave functions of the isolated system , _",
    "i.e. _ the system not coupled to the environment .",
    "this representation is useful in a way somewhat analogous to the way the energy representation is useful in the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is quite remarkable that in this representation the master equation can be solved analytically under certain approximations .",
    "the key to this result is that quantum tunneling is already encoded in the energy wave functions , which we can compute in a wkb approximation .    in order to have a working model in a form as simple as possible , but that captures the main physics of the problem , we put by hand the effect of the environment with some phenomenological terms that describe noise and dissipation in a simple form .",
    "it turns out that these terms can be deduced from microscopic physics , when the environment is made by an ohmic distribution of harmonic oscillators weakly coupled in thermal equilibrium at high temperature .",
    "thus the model is not strictly suited to describe tunneling from the false vacuum , or zero temperature transitions .",
    "the appropriate equations are known in this case @xcite and include time dependent noise and dissipation coefficients , and anomalous diffusion . thus the model studied here is a toy model at low temperature .",
    "we may expect qualitative agreement with relevant experiments at very low temperature , but no precision comparable to the instanton approach in this case .",
    "we illustrate this by comparing the analytical predictions of our model with an experiment where the escape rate from the zero voltage state was measured for a current - biased josephson junction shunted with a resistor @xcite .",
    "since our main purpose here is the introduction of a working formalism for out of equilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling we leave the more realistic and involved computation for future work .",
    "master equations play also an important role in elucidating the emergence of classicality in open quantum systems as a result of their interaction with an environment .",
    "in fact , as the master equation gives the quantum evolution of initial states , defined by the reduced wigner function at some initial time , it has been of great help to study decoherence . in particular",
    ", it has been used to clarify the decoherence time scales , or the way in which the environment selects a small set of states of the system which are relatively stable by this interaction , the so - called pointer states , whereas the coherent superposition of the remaining states are rapidly destroyed by decoherence @xcite .",
    "recently the effect of the interaction with the environment on coherent tunneling has been analyzed in the framework of an open quantum system that is classically chaotic : a harmonically driven quartic double well @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in this problem , which requires a numerical analysis , tunneling is suppressed as a consequence of the interaction with the environment .",
    "the dissipation and diffusion terms in the master equation have been derived assuming a high - temperature limit of an ohmic environment , as in the model discussed in the present work .",
    "thus , our calculation can also be understood in the context of the study of decoherence on quantum tunneling .",
    "in fact , we are able to identify the terms responsible for decoherence and their effect on tunneling in our model .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next two sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] we review the theory of tunneling in closed systems and",
    "introduce the energy representation for wigner functions .",
    "this extended review is necessary both to establish our conventions and to recall specific results which are central to the main argument . in section [ oqs ]",
    "we introduce the environment and compute the dynamical equation for the reduced wigner function of the system . in section [ ab ]",
    "we introduce the so - called quantum kramers equation , which is a local approximation to the transport equation which captures the essential physics .",
    "for the purpose of computing tunneling from the false vacuum state , the quantum kramers equation can be simplified further under the so - called phase shift approximation . in section [ tunnel ]",
    "we apply the foregoing to the actual estimate of the tunneling amplitude for the open system . in section [ experiment ]",
    "we compare the analytical predictions of our model with an experiment on a current - biased josephson junction .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we briefly summarize our results . in the appendixes we provide additional technical details .",
    "in this section we review the wkb method to tunneling in quantum mechanics .",
    "the energy eigenfunctions in the wkb approximation we obtain will play an important role in the energy representation of the wigner function that will be introduced latter .",
    "we begin with the simple closed quantum mechanical system formed by a particle of mass @xmath0 in one dimension described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 with a potential @xmath2 given by @xmath3 for small values of the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "this is a fairly general potential for a tunneling system , it is the basic element in the dashboard potential , which is a very good model for a flux trapped in a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , or a single josephson junction biased by a fixed external current @xcite . for technical reasons , it is convenient to assume that for large @xmath4 the potential flattens out and takes the value @xmath5 both negative and constant .",
    "the tunneling process ought to be independent of the form of the potential this far away from the potential barrier .",
    "we present a sketch of this potential in fig . 1 .",
    "there is one classically stable point at @xmath6 , and one unstable point @xmath7  corresponding to an energy @xmath8 .",
    "the curvature of the potential is @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11  at @xmath12 the other point at which @xmath13 is @xmath14 for @xmath15 the potential flattens out and is constant .",
    "if we assume that the particle is trapped in the potential well , that is in its false ground state or false vacuum , the tunneling probability can be computed in this simple problem in many ways .",
    "one of the most efficient is the instanton method which reduces to the computation of the `` bounce solution '' .",
    "the most attractive aspect of this computation is that it can be easily extended to field theory where the tunneling probability is then interpreted as the probability per unit time and volume to nucleate a bubble of the true vacuum phase .",
    "the rate for quantum tunneling is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the action for the `` bounce '' ( or instanton ) , namely the solution to the classical equations of motion which interpolates between @xmath6 and @xmath18 in imaginary time @xmath19 and the prefactor @xmath20 .",
    "our expression for the potential is so simple that the above integral can be computed explicitly : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the zero point energy of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath23    here , however , we will concentrate on a real time approach by expanding the false vacuum state as a linear combination of true eigenstates of the hamiltonian . to the required accuracy ,",
    "it is enough to work with the wkb approximations to the true eigenfunctions ; see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . the instanton method reviewed in the previous paragraph can ,",
    "in fact , be easily justified by this semiclassical approximation . here",
    "we explain in some detail this standard procedure to obtain the eigenfunctions by matching the wkb solutions in the different regions of the potential .",
    "these solutions will play a crucial role in the energy representation for the wigner functions to be introduced latter .",
    "let @xmath24 be the energy of the particle in the potential well , and @xmath25 the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "the schrdinger equation is @xmath26 let us define @xmath27 and the integral @xmath28 ( note the order in the integration limits ) @xmath29    the wkb solutions are obtained from these elements .",
    "we have to match the wkb solutions in the different regions across the potential function .",
    "the details of this calculation are given in appendix a. the wkb solution @xmath30 for energies in the range @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    "( [ wkb10 ] ) , where @xmath31 are the three classical turning points for the cubic potential ( [ potential ] ) ; see fig .  1 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ wkb10 ] ) is obtained by imposing the continuous normalization of the eigenfunctions given in eq .",
    "( [ norm1 ] ) and it is given in eq .",
    "( [ norm6 ] ) . of particular relevance is the value of the eigenfunction @xmath33 at values @xmath34 .",
    "this gives the main contribution to the continuous normalization integral .",

    "( [ norm2 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the details of the eigenfunctions near the false vacuum state , since we will be dealing with tunneling from vacuum .",
    "thus , in the remaining of this section we give explicitly the values of the normalization constant @xmath32 and the phase shifts @xmath36 near this vacuum state .",
    "therefore let us impose the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ( [ wkb11 ] ) and let @xmath38 be the corresponding lowest energy , that is , @xmath39 in eq .",

    "before we start with the computation of the tunneling rate we have to define what we mean by the decaying state , all the wave functions we considered so far are true stationary states and , obviously , show no decay whatsoever . we need to confine initially the particle into the potential well in its lowest energy . to this end",

    "we may assume that the growth of @xmath65 is as fast as necessary to justify the approximations below ; the tunneling rate is insensitive to the details of @xmath63 beyond @xmath12 thus , we define the decaying state @xmath66 as the ground state of a particle confined by @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "one of the main effects of the environment is to induce decoherence into the system which is a basic ingredient into the quantum to classical transition @xcite .",

    "to conclude , let us briefly summarize our findings .",
    "we have computed analytically the effect of decoherence on quantum tunneling in a model representing a quantum particle , trapped in a local minimum of a potential , which is coupled to an environment characterized by a dissipative and a diffusion parameter .",
    "we have used the master equation for the reduced wigner function , or quantum transport equation , that describes this open quantum system .",
    "our computational method involves the introduction of an energy representation of the reduced wigner function which is based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system . the dynamical equation in this representation , eq .",
    "( [ open5 ] ) , is an equation for some coefficients that describe the quantum correlations between eigenfunctions of different energies .",
    "the equation can be explicitly written in a local approximation , the quantum transport equation ( [ ab9 ] ) , that captures the essential physics of the problem .    in our problem , where the particle is initially trapped in the false vacuum , the transport equation is dominated by a term that destroys the quantum correlations of the eigenfunctions and is , thus , responsible for decoherence .",
    "the strength of this term is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath289 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ tunnel5 ] ) , which is directly proportional to the energy difference between the false and true vacuum .",
    "it does not seem surprising that decoherence suppresses tunneling , as it destroys the fine tuning among the energy eigenfunctions that makes tunneling possible in the isolated closed system .",
    "the analytic result for the ratio of the tunneling rates between the open and isolated closed systems is given by eq .",
    "( [ sexta ] ) . this ratio decreases , implying more suppression , with increasing @xmath289 .",
    "our model is based in the phenomenological transport equation ( [ open1 ] ) for the reduced wigner function , which is a toy model at zero temperature . besides this assumption , in the paper we work at two different levels of approximation .",
    "we first derive eq .",
    "( [ ab9 ] ) , which still retains the leading effects of noise , dissipation and decoherence . to be able to isolate the effects of decoherence , we then proceed to derive the simpler eq .",
    "( [ phase2 ] ) .",
    "the actual predictions for tunneling rates are obtained from this later equation , which in practice means to pick up the environment terms that give the most decoherence , and presumably the most tunneling suppression .",
    "this means that we have neglected from the remaining terms any activation that would increase the effective escape temperature .",
    "therefore the results from our model , derived from eq .",
    "( [ phase2 ] ) , must be regarded as a lower bound on the actual rates .",
    "this is consistent with our goal , which is not to provide an alternative to the instanton calculations in equilibrium , but to propose a starting point for a real time formulation of nonequilibrium macroscopic quantum tunneling . when seen under this light ,",
    "it is encouraging that the detailed matching against experimental results shows that our model not only captures the main effect , since indeed the measured rate is substantially lower than the quantum prediction for the closed system , but also yields a suitable estimate of the critical current from the given tunneling rate .",
    "one might try to improve on this prediction by numerically solving the quantum kramers equation ( [ ab9 ] ) , on which we expect to report in a separate publication .",
    "the extent of the discrepancy can be seen also as a check on the validity of the phenomenological terms introduced into the master equation for the reduced wigner function at low temperature .",
    "one should note that our approximations are valid when the initial state is the false vacuum .",
    "the results might differ , even qualitatively , when more general initial conditions are assumed and the terms that we have neglected in the quantum transport equation become relevant .",
    "it may not be possible in such a case to solve analytically the quantum transport equation .",
    "yet , we should emphasize that this equation in the energy representation is much simpler than in the standard phase space representation .",

    "<S> we consider an open quantum system with one degree of freedom consisting of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an environment characterized by a dissipative and a diffusion parameter . a representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the system uncoupled to the environment , is used to write the dynamical master equation for the reduced wigner function of the open quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> this equation becomes very simple in that representation . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the wkb approximation for the eigenfunctions suggests an approximation which allows an analytic computation of the tunneling rate , in this real time formalism , when the system is initially trapped in the false ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the decoherence produced by the environment suppresses tunneling in agreement with results in other macroscopic quantum systems with different potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we confront our analytical predictions with an experiment where the escape rate from the zero voltage state was measured for a current - biased josephson junction shunted with a resistor . </S>"
