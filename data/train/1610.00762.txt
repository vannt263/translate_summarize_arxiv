    "the traditional classification of mbius transformations is based on the number and type of fixed points and distinguishes three different classes : elliptic , loxodromic ( including hyperbolic as a special case ) and parabolic transformations , which can be identified by calculating @xmath47  [ ] . here",
    "we show that all mbius transformations can be obtained from a superposition of only two basic transformations , elliptic and hyperbolic , which in spin dynamics translate to applied real and imaginary magnetic fields , correspondingly .",
    "elliptic mbius transformation induces a uniform rotation of the entire riemann sphere around a central axis , while a hyperbolic transformation produces antipodal expansion and contraction centers , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the lines depict invariant geodesics of the corresponding mbius transformation on the sphere .",
    "according to this consideration , every elliptic and hyperbolic transformation is fully determined by two parameters : ` direction ' and ` amplitude ' , which define the direction of geodesics , including location of the fixed points , and the displacement of points on the riemann sphere along geodesics upon the transformation .    in these terms",

    "a general loxodromic transformation has two fixed points , an attractive and repulsive nodes , and can be obtained from such a superposition in a unique way , provided the symmetry axes of the elliptic and hyperbolic transformations are not mutually orthogonal .",

    "let us now consider a superposition of mutually orthogonal elliptic and hyperbolic transformations .",
    "for the transformation  ( [ m ] ) this corresponds to @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . depending on the ratio @xmath55",
    ", the transformation ( [ m ] ) can be elliptic ( @xmath56 ) , loxodromic ( @xmath57 ) or parabolic ( @xmath58 ) . as @xmath59 approaches 1 from below , two fixed points of the elliptic transformation move towards each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) until they eventually coalesce into a single fixed point of a parabolic transformation at @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "as @xmath59 is increased further , the fixed point splits into an attractive and repulsive center of the hyperbolic transformation , see fig .",

    "the standard classification  [ ] uses multipliers of the transformation , @xmath62 such that @xmath63 @xmath64 for elliptic transformations , @xmath65 for parabolic transformations , and @xmath66 for loxodromic transformations ( with real @xmath67 in the special case of hyperbolic transformations ) .",
