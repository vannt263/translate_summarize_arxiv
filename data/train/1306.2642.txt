    "the lee - wick standard model ( lwsm ) @xcite is an extension of the standard model ( sm ) that tames the higgs mass hierarchy problem by modifying the dispersion relationships of the various sm fields in order to improve the uv behavior of the theory .",
    "this modification is accomplished by introducing a new mass scale @xmath0 and extending the lagrangian by dimension - six operators of the forms @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 g^{\\nu \\beta } / { \\lambda_{\\text{\\sc lw}}}^2 $ ] . as such",
    ", the propagators fall off more rapidly in the ultraviolet ( uv ) limit above the scale @xmath0 , which softens the divergences in one - loop corrections to the higgs self - energy from dangerous quadratic ones to harmless logarithmic ones . to eliminate the need for fine tuning",
    ", @xmath0 should be not much larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "since the lwsm augments the sm by new degrees of freedom at the electroweak ( ew ) scale that are coupled to the higgs ( and indeed , one can study a variant lwsm in which only these fields are significant  @xcite ) , it is natural to expect the new physics to affect the nature of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "this connection is further motivated by the relationship between uv quadratic divergences and the phenomenon of symmetry restoration @xcite .",
    "that is , the same feynman graphs that give rise to quadratic divergences in the higgs self - energy also yield @xmath4 corrections to the effective mass at finite temperature , and thereby lift the tachyonic higgs mass and induce symmetry restoration . in previous work , the free energy density and thermodynamic properties of the lwsm plasma have been calculated @xcite , and the non - thermal effective potential has been derived @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the lwsm at finite temperature using the thermal effective potential in order to determine the nature of the electroweak phase transition and symmetry restoration .",
    "the lwsm lagrangian contains higher - order time derivatives of the various sm fields , which leads to roughly a doubling of the number of dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well - known that such higher - derivative ( hd ) theories generally suffer from a variety of pathologies ( see , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite for a pedagogical discussion ) . at the classical level ,",
    "ostrogradsky s theorem forces the hamiltonian to be unbounded from below due to excitations of the new degrees of freedom .",
    "if one departs from the canonical quantization prescription in quantizing the theory , then the spectrum can be rendered bounded from below , but at the cost of introducing states of negative norm , _ i.e. _ , ghosts .",
    "lee and wick developed a prescription for removing the ghosts and rendering the theory predictive by treating the system as a boundary - value problem and imposing boundary conditions at future infinity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "subject to these boundary conditions , the system develops an acausal behavior on the timescale @xmath5 . for @xmath6",
    ", the acausality is confined to microscopic scales , and thereby evades constraints from direct laboratory observation .    due to the pathologies of hd theories , it is _ a priori _ unclear how to correctly and consistently formulate a calculation at finite temperature .",
    "to illustrate where the trouble arises , consider a classical hd theory . at finite temperature ,",
    "a system approaches thermal equilibrium by redistributing energy between its many degrees of freedom so as to minimize its energy and maximize its entropy .",
    "however , for a system in which the hamiltonian is unbounded , the entropy can always be increased without bound by lowering the energy of some degrees of freedom and raising the energy of others .",
    "this discussion illustrates why care must be taken in formulating the calculation at finite temperature .",
    "developing the correct formulation of lee - wick theories at finite temperature is one of the goals of this paper .",
    "previous efforts to tackle this problem have taken different approaches : one group studied an ideal gas of negative - energy particles @xcite , whereas a second group studied the partition function of sm particles that are able to scatter through negative - norm narrow resonances @xcite .",
    "both groups concluded that the contribution from a lw field to the free energy is precisely the opposite of that from a sm field with identical mass and spin .",
    "however , a third group argued that the connection between symmetry restoration and uv behavior suggests that a relative minus sign should not appear @xcite . in we explore and extend the previous work by first addressing whether it is more realistic to treat the lw fields as an ideal gas or as resonances , and second by addressing the issue of the sign .",
    "on the second point , we introduce an index @xmath7 in order to consider both sign choices simultaneously and thereby keep our analysis general . for the case @xmath8(@xmath9 ) , the lw fields contribute to the free energy density with the same ( opposite ) sign as sm fields , and it is from this perspective that we proceed to study the lwsm at finite temperature .",
    "we find that the two cases lead to qualitatively different outcomes with regard to the temperature of the electroweak phase transition , as well as the sign of thermodynamic quantities in the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "for the reader who is unfamiliar with lee - wick theories , we provide a more detailed introduction to the subject in . in",
    "we formulate the thermodynamics of lee - wick theories and calculate the one - loop thermal effective potential for a toy model . in",
    "we evaluate the thermal effective potential for the lwsm and study the lwsm at finite temperature , determine the nature of the electroweak phase transition , and investigate the phenomenon of symmetry restoration . in we summarize and conclude .",
    "appendix  [ sec : quant_conv ] describes possible quantization conventions , and app .",
    "[ sec : derive_masses ] gives details of the lwsm spectrum .",
    "the lee - wick standard model  @xcite was developed by grinstein , oconnell , and wise as an alternative approach to taming the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model . in the case of the much better - explored example of low - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) , each sm loop diagram is joined by one in which the loop particle is replaced by its opposite - statistics partner ( but which carries the same gauge and yukawa couplings ) , thus introducing a relative sign difference that induces the cancellation of the leading - order ( quadratic ) divergence . in the lwsm , each loop diagram is joined by one in which the loop particle is replaced by its opposite-_norm _ partner , again inducing the desired cancellation .    the essence of the original lee and wick program  @xcite is the promotion of pauli - villars regulators to the status of full dynamical fields with negative quantum - mechanical norm .",
    "obviously , such unusual states introduce paradoxes of physical interpretation that must be addressed . at the classical level ,",
    "such signs correspond to instabilities in the form of runaway states of ever - increasing negative energy , while at the quantum level a negative norm ( which generates a hilbert space of indefinite metric  @xcite ) produces a violation of unitarity .",
    "however , lee and wick showed that these runaway solutions can be eliminated from the theory by the imposition of future boundary conditions on green s functions , which has the price of introducing violations of causality .",
    "if the lw scale is sufficiently high , then the realm of acausal effects is relegated to an unobservably microscopic scale . moreover ,",
    "if the negative - norm states are required to be unstable ( decaying into conventional particles ) , then they may be excluded from the set of asymptotic states of the theory , thus restoring unitarity . in order for the exclusion of on - shell negative - norm states to make sense in feynman loop diagrams , lee and wick developed a variant of the feynman integration contour for such cases , a program that was greatly expanded by cutkosky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( clop ) .",
    "while no problematic exceptions to this program are known , it remains unknown whether a nonperturbative formulation exists that preserves unitarity  @xcite .    in the same way that adding a pauli - villars regulator to a scalar propagator softens its high - momentum behavior from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , the lagrangian of a scalar theory containing a particle and its lw partner is promoted from one with a canonical @xmath12 kinetic energy term to a higher - derivative theory with a @xmath13 term . to be explicit ,",
    "let @xmath14 be a real scalar field appearing in the lagrangian @xmath15 where the last term represents interactions .",
    "one may recast eq .",
    "( [ eq : toyhd ] ) in an equivalent form without the hd term by introducing an auxiliary field ( af ) @xmath16 : @xmath17 the equation of motion for @xmath16 , @xmath18 is exact at the quantum level ( meaning that the path integral over this degree of freedom can be performed exactly ) , and upon substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eq : toyaf ] ) , reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : toyhd ] ) . further defining the field",
    "@xmath19 diagonalizes the kinetic energy terms : @xmath20 one diagonalizes the mixed mass terms without altering the kinetic terms by a symplectic transformation : @xmath21 with mass eigenstates being indicated by subscript @xmath22 , and the transformation parameter @xmath23 satisfies @xmath24 which admits real solutions provided @xmath25 .",
    "if this lw stability condition fails , then the kinetic and mass terms can not be simultaneously diagonalized with real mass eigenvalues , and the lagrangian does not represent a lee - wick theory .",
    "the lagrangian then assumes the form @xmath26 \\ , , \\label{eq : toylw}\\ ] ] for mass eigenvalues @xmath27 and the factor of @xmath28 can be absorbed into redefinitions of the couplings .",
    "the quadratic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : toylw ] ) clearly manifest the promised opposite - norm @xmath29 and @xmath30 propagators ( see app .  [",
    "sec : quant_conv ] ) .",
    "this fact , combined with the fixed relationship between @xmath29 and @xmath30 couplings seen in @xmath31 , leads to the cancellation of quadratic divergences , as shown explicitly in ref .",
    "while we have presented only the lw construction for a real scalar field , an analogous af construction holds for all sm fields  @xcite : complex scalars ( with or without spontaneous symmetry breaking ) , dirac fermions , and vector fields ( including gauge fields ) .",
    "we see that sm particles with lw partners can be represented by hd fields appearing in a restricted class of lagrangians ( so that the mass eigenvalues turn out real and positive ) whose propagators fall off as @xmath32 and have two propagator poles , which represent one field of positive and one of negative norm . but nothing in principle requires the hd theory to truncate at just two extra derivatives .",
    "one can define a lw theory of a given @xmath33 as one in which the full propagator has @xmath33 poles , or equivalently , @xmath34 extra derivatives in the lagrangian .",
    "the sm would therefore be called an @xmath35 theory , the lwsm would be @xmath36 , and as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can build @xmath37 theories for all fields appearing the sm , including a proper af construction .",
    "furthermore , one finds that the additional field degrees of freedom alternate in norm : each @xmath38 field , like its sm partner , has positive norm .",
    "such a generalized lw theory is quite unlike susy and rather more resembles theories with kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations , such as extra - dimension models",
    ".    nevertheless , lw theories are unlike both susy and kk theories in important respects . since no principle dictates how many lw partners a given sm field possesses nor what determines the lw scale , one can imagine a scenario in which some sm fields have 2 partners , some have 1 , and some have none .",
    "in contrast , the closure of the susy algebra requires every field to have precisely one opposite - statistics partner , while kk theories have no predetermined limit on the number of modes available to the field .",
    "this generality of lw theories of course comes at a price . to name just a few issues : in fits to data or in making predictions",
    ", one must allow for the possibility that all field lw mass scales are distinct ; the equivalent hd theory may only be an effective theory of an unknown uv completion ( for our purposes , we assume only that the effective theory is good up to the 14  tev reach of the large hadron collider ) ; and while grand unification is possible  @xcite , it is not as straightforward to arrange as in , say , the mssm .",
    "even so , lw theories are quite flexible and can be combined with other beyond - sm ( bsm ) ideas like susy  @xcite .",
    "the lwsm was subjected to tests of its phenomenological viability as a potential bsm theory already starting in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently compared to precision electroweak constraints in a variety of interesting ways  @xcite .",
    "the consensus view emerged that lw gauge bosons must have masses at least @xmath39  tev and the lw fermions at least several tev , but the lw scalars can be substantially lighter .",
    "when @xmath38 partners are permitted , the allowed gauge boson partner masses must still be at least 2  tev or higher , and the fermions may be as low as @xmath40  tev , but viable scenarios in which the scalar partners lie in the several hundred gev range emerge  @xcite .",
    "in this section we address the question of how one should calculate the thermodynamic properties ( _ e.g. _ , entropy , energy density ) of a lw theory .",
    "it is unclear to what extent the standard formulation of this calculation is applicable due to the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom , namely , the negative - norm lw particles . at zero temperature ,",
    "one imposes boundary conditions to remove the lw particles from the set of asymptotic states and employs the lw / clop prescriptions to calculate elements of the unitary s  matrix between states containing only sm particles .",
    "it is not obvious how to extend the boundary conditions and lw / clop prescriptions to a lw theory at finite temperature .",
    "thus , two pictures emerge : either    * the thermal system can access states containing explicit lw particles , or * the system can only explore states from which these explicit lw particles are absent .    both scenarios have been considered in the literature ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite obtains the same result for the free energy as ref .",
    "we argue , however , that the pictures are not equivalent , but instead that the second picture , in which lw particles only serve to modify the scattering of sm particles , is more realistic . in the next subsection",
    "we show that no self - consistent calculation using ideal gas lw particles appears to agree with the common result of refs .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite uses a convention of negative - energy , positive - norm particles , while ref .",
    "@xcite uses negative - norm , positive - energy particles .",
    "while we adopt the second convention , the first one can be shown to be equivalent if properly implemented ( see app .",
    "a ) .      in this section",
    ", we consider the first of the two pictures discussed above and calculate the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas of lw particles .",
    "a lw theory contains both sm and lw particles , but in the absence of interactions , their ideal gas contributions can be evaluated separately .",
    "we define the partition function @xmath41 by the requirement that the density matrix , @xmath42 is properly normalized ( see below ) . with interactions turned off ,",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath43 consists of the vacuum @xmath44 , single - particle states @xmath45 , and multi - particle states @xmath46 with the appropriate symmetrization ( anti - symmetrization ) for bosons ( fermions ) .",

    "the negative norm implies that eigenvalues and expectation values differ by a sign .",
    "for instance , @xmath56 whereas the state @xmath45 has eigenvalue @xmath57 .",
    "this distinction is particularly relevant for the calculation of the partition function .",
    "if we normalize the density matrix by requiring @xmath58 then the partition function @xmath59 is given by a sum of expectation values @xmath60 in the case @xmath61 , the terms alternate in sign . since the expectation values of @xmath62 are not strictly positive , the possibility may arise that the sum of the eigenvalues of @xmath62 becomes greater than unity , while @xmath62 itself remains normalized in the sense of .",
    "it is not clear how to interpret such a density matrix .",

    "we do not dwell on the issue of which normalization condition is the `` correct '' one , and the following section makes this debate moot .",

    "examining the propagator , we see that the @xmath292 contains seven degrees of freedom : three massless transverse polarizations ( @xmath293 ) , one massless longitudinal polarization ( @xmath294 ) , and three massive transverse polarizations ( @xmath295 ) .",
    "the four massless degrees of freedom constitute the sm photon , and after accounting for the two `` negative degrees of freedom '' of the ghosts @xmath260 and @xmath264 , the count of `` physical '' photon polarizations is reduced to two . here",
    ", the lwsm does not double the number of gauge degrees of freedom , but instead adds three , which is what one expects for an additional massive resonance . for the @xmath296 boson we count three degrees of freedom with mass @xmath297 , three degrees of freedom with mass @xmath298 , one degree of freedom with mass @xmath299 , and two negative degrees of freedom of mass @xmath300 coming from the ghosts .",
    "the ghost cancels the longitudinal polarization state , and one negative degree of freedom remains .",
    "once we restrict to the landau gauge ( @xmath301 ) , the ghosts and longitudinal polarizations become massless . then these degrees of freedom do not yield a field - dependent contribution to the effective potential , but they do affect the number of relativistic species at finite temperature .",
    "thus , we have counted them as massless particles in , which also summarizes eqs .",

    "let the @xmath302 doublet @xmath303 be a left - handed weyl spinor , and let the singlet @xmath304 be a right - handed weyl spinor .",
    "neglecting gauge interactions , the lagrangian for the top sector is written as @xmath305 where @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "contractions of the @xmath302 doublets is accomplished with the totally antisymmetric 2-tensor @xmath308 .",

    "<S> the lee - wick standard model at temperatures near the electroweak scale is considered , with the aim of studying the electroweak phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> while lee - wick theories possess states of negative norm , they are not pathological but instead are treated by imposing particular boundary conditions and using particular integration contours in the calculation of s - matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> it is not immediately clear how to extend this prescription to formulate the theory at finite temperature ; we explore two different pictures of finite - temperature lw theories , and calculate the thermodynamic variables and the ( one - loop ) thermal effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> we apply these results to study the lee - wick standard model and find that the electroweak phase transition is a continuous crossover , much like in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high - temperature behavior is modified due to cancellations between thermal corrections arising from the negative- and positive - norm states . </S>"
