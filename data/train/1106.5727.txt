    "the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is commonly invoked to explain the origin of turbulence in electrically conducting discs @xcite .",
    "although the instability itself is amenable to an analytic treatment , much of what is currently known about the nonlinear development of this instability is based on numerical simulations . in particular , the efficiency of mri driven turbulence at transporting angular momentum , which is the crucial quantity that ultimately controls the accretion rate , is known almost exclusively through numerical simulations . because of the difficulties inherent in simulating an entire disc the majority of the numerical work has been based on the local model known as the shearing - box approximation @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the shearing - box approximation ( sba ) are numerous , the cylindrical geometry of the full disc is replaced with the cartesian geometry of a rectangle , simple periodic and shear - periodic boundary conditions can be applied , and most importantly , whatever numerical resolution is available can be deployed to resolving the ensuing turbulence . however , a number of issues arise that have led several authors to question the applicability of the shearing - box approximation ( sba ) to the study disc turbulence . @xcite",
    "have noted some inconsistencies in the formulations of the sba with uniform background states , they have also questioned the assumption of locality that underlies the derivation of the sba .",
    "related concerns about locality were expressed by @xcite .",
    "however , the biggest issue about the sba remains the so - called problem of convergence .",
    "there are two configurations in which mri driven turbulence is studied numerically ; one in which there is a net magnetic flux threading the layer , the other in which there is none . in the former case ,",
    "if the uniform component of the magnetic field is vertical , say , there is a linearly unstable mode with a well defined vertical wavenumber of maximum growth rate that sets the scale of the instability , in the latter no such state exists , and the mri must set in as a subcritical instability .",
    "similar considerations apply if the initial field is azimuthal .",
    "what exactly determines the characteristic scale of the turbulence in the no - net - flux case is , at the moment , an open question .",
    "the conceptual appeal of the no - flux case is that it offers the possibility of a universal state of mri turbulence in which the disc becomes self magnetized through dynamo action , so that the angular momentum transport depends on the disc properties but not on the amount of flux threading the disc .",
    "clearly much effort has been devoted to determining if such a universal state exists , and the value of the associated turbulent transport .",
    "simply stated , the problem of convergence is that the angular momentum transport measured in numerical simulations based on the sba with homogeneous background state and zero mean - flux depends on numerical resolution , and decreases as the resolution increases .",
    "this effect was first noted by @xcite in a series of numerical experiments with the zeus code and subsequently confirmed by other authors using different codes ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are a number of important points that should be made .",
    "most of the evidence for the convergence problem is based on codes with no explicit viscosity or magnetic diffusivity in which the dissipation arises solely from truncation errors .",
    "an increase in resolution is interpreted as a decrease in effective dissipation , so that the convergence problem can equivalently be stated as a decrease in the effective transport with decreasing dissipation .",
    "recently , however , @xcite indicated that the problem does not arise when explicit viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are included .",
    "also , the problem is seen in simulations with homogeneous background state and periodic boundary conditions in the vertical .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest that the convergence problem is absent if different boundary conditions are applied in which the magnetic field is vertical on the upper and lower boundaries . also , the problem seems to disappear when stratification is included @xcite , or the aspect ratio is such that that computational domain consists of a sufficiently tall box ( stone , private communication ) .",
    "finally , even when the effect is clearly observed there is no universal agreement about the rate at which the transport decreases with resolution .",
    "a number of questions naturally arise : what is the origin of the convergence problem ? is it a numerical artifact associated with the indiscriminate use of ideal solvers ? is it a real physical phenomenon related to subcritial dynamo instabilities ?",
    "is it that the shearing - box approximation in its simplest form is too idealized to describe mri turbulence in a disc ?",
    "what is the asymptotic scaling of the angular momentum transport with resolution / dissipation , and what can we learn from it ?    in this paper",
    "we address some of these issues .",
    "we revisit numerically the problem of mri driven turbulence in shearing - boxes with uniform background state and periodic boundary conditions in the vertical .",
    "we formulate the problem in a slightly unconventional way that is designed to emphasize the role of symmetries in the shearing - box approximation , and to make it easier to distinguish between numerical and physical effects .    in the ideal limit ,",
    "the shearing - box equations are scale invariant , in the sense that doubling the number of grid points in a simulation , or doubling the size of the computational domain are entirely equivalent .",
    "this gives rise to two equivalent limiting procedures ; letting the grid spacing vanish for finite domain size , and letting the domain size become infinite for finite grid - spacing .",
    "although the two limits are equivalent , the latter makes it easier to interpret the results in terms of some classical results from dynamo theory . using this formulation we consider the results of high - resolution numerical experiments and reach the following conclusions .",
    "the convergence problem is real in the sense that the transport by mri driven turbulence does decrease with decreasing dissipation and vanishes for vanishing dissipation .",
    "the problem is related to two aspects of the shearing - box approximation with periodic boundary conditions , one is the inherent symmetry of the shearing - box approximation , the other is the absence of an effective inverse cascade in the dynamo solutions .",
    "we find that there exists an asymptotic regime in which the effects of the symmetries are apparent but it is realized at very high resolution , or as we shall see presently , at very large system size , suggesting that most of the simulations described in the current literature are not in that regime .",
    "finally , we argue that even though the shearing - box approximation in its simplest form is probably unable to capture the physics of mri driven turbulence in discs , it nevertheless gives us very useful clues of which effects are likely to be important , and how to proceed to improve our models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss the zero - flux case ; we review the standard formulations and propose a slightly different approach that better separates between physical and numerical quantities .",
    "we present numerical evidence that suggest the existence of an asymptotic state in which the transport becomes independent of system size .",
    "we then discuss cases with small but finite flux , and show that they match smoothly with the zero - flux cases . finally , we discuss the implications for modeling astrophysical discs .",
    "we begin by discussing the case with no mean flux . conceptually , this is the simplest case since for an ideal incompressible fluid , the sba is completely scale invariant . as we shall see",
    "presently , this symmetry plays an important role in determining the asymptotic form of the solutions .",
    "the first step is to cast the sba equations in dimensionless form .",
    "often , this is accomplished by selecting units that depend on the sound speed , although this choice is convenient from an astrophysical point of view it is not the most suitable to bring out the natural symmetries of the equations . instead , we begin by considering an incompressible fluid ",
    "i.e . a fluid with infinite sound speed , with finite viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , and we shall return to the compressible case presently . a detailed presentation of the sba can be found in @xcite;(see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the equations in _ dimensional _ form can be written as :    @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote , respectively , magnetic field , velocity , density and pressure .",
    "the local angular velocity @xmath7 and shear rate @xmath8 are considered constants . for a keplerian disk @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the velocity can be decomposed as the sum of the base keplerian flow and the fluctuations @xmath11 likewise , the pressure can be decomposed as the sum of the average and the fluctuations @xmath12 with these decompositions , the dimensional shearing box equations become    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    with @xmath16 .",
    "the above system of equations contains only three dimensional parameters : the rotation frequency @xmath17 , the viscosity @xmath18 and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath19 .    by adopting the following units of time , length , velocity and magnetic field intensity @xmath20",
    "the equations can be written in dimensionless form as    @xmath21    @xmath22    where the hatted quantities are dimensionless and @xmath23 is the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "it is important to note that the induction equation ( [ eq : nondim2 ] ) only depends on @xmath24 , while the momentum equation ( [ eq : nondim1 ] ) has no adjustable parameters at all .",
    "this is because in the sba with no mean flux , the diffusive scale @xmath25 is the only intrinsic length that can be defined using the dimensional parameters of the problem .",
    "clearly , in order to solve equations ( [ eq : nondim1 ] -[eq : nondim2 ] ) one also needs to define a computational domain and suitable boundary conditions thereby introducing an external length - scale @xmath26 that characterizes the size of the computational box ; the latter , however , has no direct physical meaning . in particular , in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( shearing periodic in the radial direction ) ,",
    "formally one is considering an infinite domain , with @xmath26 representing a long wavelength cutoff .",
    "the domain size can itself be nondimensionalized to define the additional parameter @xmath27 . for fixed magnetic prandtl number , @xmath28 the domain size in units of the diffusive scale is the only adjustable parameter .",
    "we note that the non - dimensional form of the equations above is different from what is typically found in the literature . in general",
    ", the box size is used as unit of length and the square of the parameter @xmath28 is then identified with the reynolds number . however , in a turbulent flow , the reynolds number should be more properly defined in terms of the integral scale of the turbulence .",
    "the question then becomes whether asymptotically , for @xmath29 , in mri turbulence the integral scale is linked to the box size , or to the diffusive scale , or to a combination of both .",
    "we note that if the solutions become asymptotically independent of the box size , the system of equations ( [ eq : nondim1 ] - [ eq : nondim2 ] ) do not depend on any non - dimensional parameters , apart from the prandtl number , i.e. for fixed prandtl number there is a universal solution .    in the zero net flux case",
    ", dynamo processes must effectively maintain the magnetic field against dissipation , however the magnetic field is itself responsible for generating , through the mri , the turbulence that sustains it .",
    "it is well known that , in a ( small - scale ) turbulent dynamo , the magnetic energy is concentrated near the resistive scale . in this case",
    ", one expects that the mri driven velocity may also be characterized by the diffusive scale . in order for the velocity to have a significant component comparable to the box size an efficient mechanism",
    "is required that can transfer energy backwards , from the resistive scale to the largest available scale , i.e. an inverse cascade .",
    "whether such an inverse cascade exists is at the heart of the problem .    as an aside",
    ", we note that the condition for the validity of the sba is that the characteristic scales of the solution be much smaller than the box size , lest the use of periodic boundary conditions is not justified .",
    "therefore , if there were cases in which the shearing box results would show a dependence of the solutions on the box size @xmath28 as @xmath29 , one should actually reformulate these cases by introducing some global scale characteristic of the whole disc .",
    "one of the main objectives of mri studies is to determine the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum by maxwell and reynolds stresses .",
    "it is customary to define the quantity @xmath30 that represents the box and time averaged value of the total stresses ( hereinafter overbars denote time averages , while angle brackets denote a box average ) .",
    "this quantity has dimensions of square velocity , thus with our choice of non - dimensionalisation it is measured in units of @xmath31 . for fixed magnetic prandtl number we can write @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is a dimensionless function that accounts for the possible dependence of the solutions on the externally imposed box size .",
    "when @xmath34 the box size is comparable to the diffusive scale , and , on general grounds , one expect a strong dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath28 .",
    "it is not clear , _ a priori _ , what dependence one should expect as @xmath35 .",
    "it is important , however , to be clear about the relationship between the asymptotic form of @xmath33 and the transport efficiency . in turbulence theory",
    ", it is customary to refer to  turbulent transport \" to describe a transport process that becomes independent of diffusion for small diffusion , and to  collisional transport \" to describe one such process that remains proportional to the diffusivities when these become small . because , here , @xmath36 is measured in diffusive units ( @xmath31 ) , if @xmath37 as @xmath29 the angular momentum transport is entirely collisional .",
    "conversely , in order for the transport to be  turbulent \" in the sense defined above , @xmath38 as @xmath29",
    ". in fact , any asymptotic dependence of @xmath33 weaker than @xmath39 , will ultimately lead to a transport that vanishes for vanishing viscosity .",
    "typically , in the literature , the transport efficiency is measured in terms of the parameter @xmath40 . in the incompressible case",
    "this is defined as the total stresses measured in units of @xmath41 @xcite ; in other words @xmath42 since @xmath43 .",
    "again , we recover the result that in order for @xmath40 to have asymptotically finite ( constant ) value the function @xmath33 must diverge quadratically as @xmath28 becomes large .",
    "when compressibility is taken into account , an additional physical parameter is introduced , namely the sound speed @xmath44 , that can be used to define a new length scale @xmath45 . when vertical gravity is accounted for , @xmath46 ,",
    "represents the scale height of the disc . in studies such as the present one , in which vertical gravity is neglected",
    ", this length has no direct meaning , nevertheless it introduces a new non - dimensional parameter @xmath47 , that must be taken into account in the scaling arguments discussed above . as before we can write @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a dimensionless function . for @xmath50 ,",
    "again we expect a strong dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath52 .",
    "however for @xmath52 large , @xmath51 must become asymptotically independent of @xmath52 , since this corresponds to the incompressible limit in which @xmath51 must approach @xmath53 .",
    "physically , this corresponds to situations in which @xmath46 is much larger than the characteristic scales of the solutions .",
    "again , if there is no dependence of these scales on the externally imposed box size @xmath26 , the only available length is @xmath54 and the characteristic scales of the solutions will be proportional to @xmath54 . for constant sound speed and therefore constant ratio @xmath55 ,",
    "the limit @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath56 , and therefore the stress behavior should be the same as in the incompressible case . in this case",
    "@xmath40 is defined as in @xcite @xmath57 and we therefore expect again the scaling @xmath58      in most of the mri studies , as well as in this paper , the analysis of mri turbulence is performed using ideal codes , where dissipative effects only arise due to numerical truncation . in general , in this case , it is not known how to write the dissipation term explicitly , however it can be said that the amount of dissipation depends on the ratio between the local scale of variation of the physical quantities and the cell size .",
    "structures comparable to the cell size are subject to strong dissipation that decreases when the scale of the structures increases .",
    "different numerical schemes , however , will behave in different ways , in particular the reduction of dissipation when the local scale is decreased will be sharper for high order schemes and gentler for lower order ones .",
    "in ( [ eq : scalings ] ) we defined the dissipation scale in terms of the viscosity and the shear as @xmath59 . in the numerical approach",
    "one is not able to get an explicit expression for the dissipation scale , nevertheless it is known that @xmath60 is related to the cell size @xmath61 , in a way that , however , depends on the scheme .",
    "in addition , it is know that @xmath60 ( in units of @xmath61 ) will be larger for lower order schemes and smaller for the high order ones .",
    "thus , in the non - dimensionalization of the equations , in principle one should use @xmath60 , but in practice one can only use @xmath61 . with the two dimensional parameters @xmath17 and @xmath61 , it is possible to define the units of time @xmath62 , length @xmath54 , velocity @xmath63 and magnetic field @xmath64 as @xmath65    by the same considerations discussed above , the scaling of stresses can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents the number of grid points and the @xmath68 factor accounts for a possible dependence of the solutions on the externally imposed box size .",
    "the scaling for @xmath40 is correspondingly given by @xmath69 if there is no dependence on the box size , i.e. @xmath68 is constant , we have @xmath70 ; this constant however will be different from scheme to scheme , since different numerical schemes , as discussed above , will have different relationships between the dissipation length @xmath60 and the cell size @xmath61 . the proper unit for @xmath36 would be @xmath71 , therefore we expect @xmath72 since @xmath60 is expected to be smaller for high order codes the same should be true for the value of @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that this discussion ignores possible difference in the effective prandtl number for the different schemes , that can account for additional residual differences between codes .    for the compressible case",
    ", we can repeat the same reasoning as above : we have an additional parameter @xmath74 that represents the number of grid points over h , however the dependence on this parameter should disappear , for constant sound speed , in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "we have performed a series of compressible isothermal shearing box simulations for the zero net flux case , with different resolutions and with three different numerical schemes available in the pluto code @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the three schemes is the order of accuracy of the reconstruction , more precisely we employed a scheme with tvd linear reconstruction ( second order accurate for smooth flows ) , a parabolic reconstruction ( ppm ) and a monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction ( mp5 ) ( for a description of this scheme see @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the separation of scales between the box size and the dissipation length becomes large .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the resolution for a fixed scheme , or for a fixed resolution , by using a scheme with higher order of accuracy .    in the shearing box approach ,",
    "the cartesian coordinates @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 refer respectively to the radial , azimuthal and vertical directions .",
    "our computational box has aspect ratio @xmath79 . as in @xcite",
    "we use cells elongated in the azimuthal direction , with aspect ratio @xmath80 . for each of the schemes we used four different resolutions : 32 , 64 , 128 and 256 points in the vertical direction , the corresponding grid sizes are therefore @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the sound speed is chosen such that @xmath85 , the initial magnetic field is @xmath86 , with @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath88 and random noise in the @xmath77 component of the velocity is introduced initially to start the growth of the instability .    as it is well known , the time histories of quantities like the box averaged magnetic energy or the box averaged maxwell or reynolds stresses , have an initial transient followed by the establishment of a stationary state in which the quantities fluctuate around a well defined mean value .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations decreases with increasing resolution . to estimate the mean value we average over the simulation time excluding the initial transient phase .",
    "the simulation time varies from case to case and it is always larger than 100 revolutions . we estimate the error of the mean value by subdividing the averaging interval in ten subintervals and then computing the standard deviation of the subinterval averages .",
    "the resulting estimate of the error is always less than 10% .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the behavior of @xmath40 , as defined in ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , as a function of resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : maxw ] shows @xmath73 as a function of @xmath89 for all the cases considered .",
    "the quantity displayed represents the function @xmath68 defined in ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) , which accounts for a possible dependence of the solutions on the externally imposed box size .",
    "consonant with our objectives , we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath68 as @xmath90 .",
    "we recall that in order for @xmath40 to be resolution independent , @xmath68 should diverge as @xmath91 .",
    "the results by @xcite suggested that @xmath92 .",
    "a constant value of @xmath68 , on the other hand , means that the solution is asymptotically independent of the box size and that the scaling of @xmath40 is determined solely by the equations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : maxw ] , the squares refer to the linear scheme , the stars to the ppm and the triangles to the mp5 . it is obvious that , as the the order of accuracy of the scheme is increased , the curves tend to be flatter for increasing @xmath89 . however , while the linear and ppm schemes show a continually decreasing slope and do not seem to have reached yet an asymptotic behavior , the mp5 scheme , by contrast , appears to be leveling out .",
    "the results of mp5 suggest that @xmath68 approaches a constant value as @xmath90 and therefore that @xmath40 has the asymptotic natural scaling @xmath93 arising from the equations alone .",
    "our expectation is that , given sufficient resolution , a similar behaviour would be observed with the other schemes .    it is important to note that even if all the curves corresponding to different schemes eventually level off , they will not in general have identical asymptotic values .",
    "the reason for this is that we do not know the explicit form of the numerical dissipation for each scheme ; accordingly we have used the cell size instead of the dissipation length to non - dimensionalize the equations .",
    "indeed , we note that in agreement with ( [ eq : alpha3 ] ) the higher order scheme mp5 has a lower value of the non - dimensional stresses than the other schemes .     as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "the three curves refer to the three different numerical schemes used in the simulations .",
    "these are identified by the symbols in the legend . in all cases ,",
    "the error bars are smaller than the symbols .",
    "the slope is about 1 , corresponding to the results by @xcite with the zeus code , for the ppm curve between n=64 and n=128 . ]",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 as a function of resolution suggests that the only scale that determines the properties of the solutions is the dissipative scale , which , in numerical studies , is related to the cell size .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the behavior of the size of the typical observed structures as a function of resolution . in order to characterize the scales of magnetic structures",
    ", we measure the average scales of variation of the field in the directions parallel and perpendicular to itself .",

    "this result is also discussed by @xcite , who base their analysis on the correlation function .",
    "they find that the correlation lengths scale as @xmath101 and that therefore , measured in units of the cell size , show an increase with resolution , suggesting that one could expect some kind of transition .",
    "we have also repeated this convergence analysis on the correlation lengths and again we find that while the linear and ppm schemes show a behavior similar to that discussed by guan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , the mp5 scheme at a resolution of 256 grid points shows a convergent behavior , i.e. the correlation lenghts scale as the cell size .",
    "a better impression of the magnetic field structure can be obtained by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : imgstr ] , where we show a 2d cut of the maxwell stress distribution in the @xmath102 plane at @xmath103 .",
    "the 3d sheets appear in the figure as filaments of high maxwell stresses and high magnetic field intensity , separated by regions of low magnetic field .",
    "plane of the distribution of maxwell stresses .",
    "the distribution is characterized by thin filaments with high stress values separated by wide regions where the stresses are almost zero . ]",
    "we can now discuss this filamentary structure from a more physical point of view .",
    "from the y - component of the induction equation , it can be seen that the field structure is determined by the competition between three terms : the stretching by the background shear , the stretching due to velocity fluctuations ( @xmath104 term ) and dissipation , and the transverse size is determined by the balance between these terms .",
    "the background shear tends to stretch the field along the azimuthal direction , simultaneously decreasing its perpendicular scale of variation , until dissipation sets in .",
    "these magnetic filaments , however , give rise to a local transport of momentum and , therefore , tend to reduce the local shear .",
    "one , therefore expects that the effect of the nonlinear term @xmath104 is to reduce the stretching by the background shear .",
    "the observed increase of the normalized transverse scale with increasing resolution may be related to the increase of this effect , which however , ultimately , has to be limited since it can not completely suppress the background shear .",
    "thus , asymptotically the transverse scale has to remain constant and be determined by the balance between shear stretching and dissipation .",
    "the mp5 scheme , which is closer to the asymptotic behavior , accordingly shows a tendency of the transverse scale to become constant .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that a possible dependence on the scale of the box may appear only in the parallel scale .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath105 seems to be independent from resolution , i.e. the magnetic structures do not appear to become more elongated as the resolution increases and all the characteristic lengths appear to become asymptotically constant when measured in unit of the dissipative length .",
    "further details on the solutions can be examined by considering the behavior of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of magnetic field intensity and of the second order structure functions .",
    "our purpose is twofold : on one hand we want to show that , indeed , if we measure all quantities in their proper units , there is a convergence to a well defined solution when we increase the number of grid points and , on the other hand , we want to better characterize this solution .",
    "we start by examining the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of magnetic field intensity .",
    "figure [ fig : pdf ] compares the two mp5 cases with the highest resolution , the pdf s are normalized to unity and the field values are measured in units of @xmath64 .     for two mp5 cases with different resolutions . the number of grid - points per unit length  measured in units of @xmath26are 128 ( solid line ) and 256 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the field values larger than that indicated by the vertical line contribute to about @xmath106 of magnetic energy and @xmath107 of maxwell stresses . ]",
    "the pdf s have an exponential character , the mean value of @xmath108 is about 5.5 with a difference of less than @xmath109 between the two cases at different resolution .",
    "the contribution to the magnetic energy and to the maxwell stresses comes mainly from the high field values ; values to the right of the vertical line plotted in the figure contribute to about @xmath106 of the total magnetic energy and to about @xmath107 of total maxwell stresses , while occupying only about @xmath110 of the volume . the higher contribution to",
    "the maxwell stresses with respect to magnetic energy is explained by the fact that these higher field values correspond to the magnetic structures discussed above . for these",
    ", there is a strong correlation between the radial and azimuthal components of the field , while for lower field values the correlation is much lower .",
    "the fact that the volume fraction supporting the transport is independent of resolution explains the decrease in the amplitude of the fluctuations when resolution is increased .",
    "in fact , as resolution is increased and the volume fraction remains the same , the number of points that contributes to the average gets larger and therefore the fluctuations of the average become smaller .    in fig [ fig : struct1 ]",
    "we plot the time averaged second order longitudinal and transverse structure functions for the @xmath77 component of magnetic field , for the two mp5 cases at the highest resolution .",
    "they are explicitly defined as @xmath111 following our discussion , we compute @xmath112 and @xmath113 in units of @xmath114 and @xmath115 in units of @xmath61 . again , it can be seen that , using these units , the difference between the two cases at different resolution is very small , indicating a convergent behavior .",
    "the structure functions in both directions become flat at scales larger than few grid points .",
    "this plateau indicates that the values of magnetic fields become uncorrelated at these scales .",
    "a similar conclusion could be reached from the behavior of the averaged spectra , like those shown in @xcite , that become flat at small wavenumbers .    from these two results ,",
    "we conclude that the solution is characterized by the superposition of uncorrelated magnetic sheets .",
    "those with high field intensity also have a high degree of correlation between magnetic field components , and consequently give the highest contribution to both the total magnetic energy and maxwell stresses .",
    "an increase of the domain size does not change the properties of these sheets , but simply increases the available volume and therefore the number of sheets , leaving unchanged all the average properties . in a similar way",
    "there should not be any modification of the solution by changing the aspect ratio of the computational box , and we have indeed tested this by examining two further cases with aspect ratios respectively @xmath116 and @xmath117 , with mp5 and @xmath118 points in the vertical direction , finding no changes in all the averaged properties .    .",

    "we now turn to the case in which a net magnetic flux threads the computational domain . in this case",
    "the magnetic field has a uniform component of strength @xmath119 , say , that can be used to define a new dimensional length scale @xmath120 given by @xmath121 accordingly , the averaged stresses will show a dependence also on this scale and keeping the same units as in the previous section , in general we can write @xmath122 here , we are mostly interested in the form of the function @xmath123 , when @xmath124 . on general grounds ,",
    "we expect , it will take different forms for different relationships between the three scales @xmath26 , @xmath120 and @xmath60 .",
    "we start our discussion by considering what is known from numerical simulations in the available literature .",
    "the case that has received the greatest attention is that of a mean vertical field ; the results have been summarized in @xcite . for this case",
    "the system is linearly unstable to the mri ; the ( vertical ) wavelength of maximum growth rate is given by @xmath125 , the instability exists only for wavelengths @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath120 is larger than @xmath127 , no unstable wavelengths fit in the box , the system becomes stable , and the stresses drop to zero .",
    "@xcite show that as @xmath120 increases , the stresses scale linearly with @xmath120 , reach a maximum and , eventually , drop to zero when the above condition is met .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that , at fixed @xmath128 that the stresses increase with resolution i.e . with @xmath28 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; thus , for high enough resolution , they should converge to a value independent of @xmath28 .",
    "also , we have to note that @xcite have found a dependence of the solutions on the aspect ratio @xmath129 of the computational box , with a convergent behavior for high enough values of @xmath129 . putting these considerations together ,",
    "we conclude that for @xmath130 ,    @xmath131    where the function @xmath123 is initially proportional to @xmath128 , then reaches a maximum ( at a fixed value of @xmath132 ) and finally drops to zero for @xmath133 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath36 at the maximum scales as @xmath134 .    in the opposite regime , when @xmath135 , the averaged stresses tend towards the value obtained in the zero flux case @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section suggest that , for large @xmath28 , @xmath36 is independent of @xmath26 and scales as @xmath71 .    in order to connect smoothly the two portions with , respectively , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , there must be an intermediate range of values of @xmath120 in which the stresses scale as @xmath138 . in this range",
    "the solution becomes insensitive both to @xmath60 and to @xmath26 , this can be achieved only if @xmath120 is sufficiently far from both scales and therefore the extent of this intermediate range with quadratic scaling should increase as @xmath28 increases .",
    "contrariwise , decreasing @xmath28 should cause the interval to shrink eventually to disappear for low values of @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalingnetflux ] , we show the results of calculations with a net vertical flux performed at a resolution of 128 points in the vertical direction , with the mp5 scheme .",
    "the horizontal dashed line corresponds to the averaged stress value for the zero flux case , the dashed line corresponds to a quadratic scaling , the solid line corresponds to a linear scaling and the vertical solid line marks the stability boundary ; to the right of it , the stresses vanish .",
    "it is apparent from the figure , that indeed , for small enough @xmath120 , a range of values of exists with quadratic scaling , while for larger @xmath120 the curve reverts the to linear scaling discussed above .",
    "we have deliberately restricted our investigation to values of @xmath120 for which we have quadratic scaling and the transition from quadratic to linear .",
    "larger values of @xmath120 , for which the stresses increase linearly up to a maximum and drop to zero to the right of the stability boundary have already been extensively discussed in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note here , that the portion with quadratic scaling has never before been reported in the literature ( however @xcite find evidence of a scaling steeper than linear ) , this is most likely due to limited resolution since , as discussed above , for low values of @xmath28 , the quadratic portion disappears .",
    "we believe that the reason why we were able to detect it is because of the high order of accuracy of the mp5 scheme , which for the same resolution , produces a much higher _ effective _ value of @xmath28 .    , the triangles represents the results of numerical calculations carried out with the mp5 scheme , with 128 points in the vertical direction .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the averaged stress value for the zero flux case ; the dashed line shows a quadratic behavior ; the solid line shows a linear behavior and the vertical solid line shows the linear stability boundary . ]",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the problem of convergence in numerical studies of mri driven turbulence in the homogeneous shearing box approximation .",
    "any simulation that is physically useful should have some meaningful property that becomes independent of the number of grid points as the latter becomes large .",
    "this does not seem to be the case here . as noted by several authors , in the weak flux regime  i.e .",
    "when the total magnetic flux threading the computational box is small or zero , the dimensional angular momentum transport decreases as as the resolution increases eventually becoming arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "there are at least two possible frameworks in which to address this issue : one in terms of reynolds number , the other in terms of computational domain size . in both cases",
    "one is interested in the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as either the reynolds number or the domain size become large .",
    "clearly , both frameworks are related and to some extent it is a matter of preference which one it is picked . in this paper",
    "we have chosen to discuss the convergence problem in terms of domain size .",
    "the reason is that , because of the symmetries of the homogeneous shearing box approximation , there is no a priori characteristic outer scale for the velocity , which leads to an ambiguity in the definition of the reynolds number . on the other hand",
    "there is a natural inner scale  i.e . the dissipation length  that can be used to non dimensionalize the equations . in this case",
    ", the reynolds number is fixed , and of order unity , and the only remaining free parameter is the domain size . with this choice , increasing the resolution and increasing the domain size are entirely equivalent operations .",
    "it is then possible to define the characteristic scale of the solutions , once they are computed , in terms of , say , the ( inverse ) scale at which the velocity or magnetic spectrum peaks ; the latter quantity being conceptually useful since it is related to the effective angular momentum transport .",
    "the problem of convergence then relates to the behavior of the characteristic scale of the solutions as the computational domain size increases .",
    "as we discussed in section 2 , there are two limiting possibilities : one in which the solution scale diverges with the domain size , the other in which it becomes asymptotically independent of it .",
    "the former can lead to a net turbulent transport that is independent of diffusivity , the latter to a quasi - collisional transport that scales as some fixed multiple of the diffusivity .",
    "the evidence from the numerical simulations , in particular figure [ fig : maxw ] , is that it is the latter and not the former that gives the correct asymptotic behavior . in other words ,",
    "the characteristic scale of the solutions becomes independent of the size of the computational domain .",
    "if we accept this result as correct , there are a number of issues that naturally arise .",
    "the first concerns the physical interpretation of the result . in the weak field regime , mri driven turbulence should be considered within the framework of a subcritical dynamo instability since the magnetic field necessary for the development of the mri must be generated self - consistently by the mri turbulence itself . in dynamo theory , it is customary to distinguish between two types of dynamo action , small - scale and large - scale .",
    "small - scale dynamos generate magnetic field with characteristic scale comparable to , or smaller than the characteristic scale of the velocity field .",
    "the only requirements for the operation of such dynamos are that the magnetic reynolds number be sufficiently high , and that the underlying velocity not be too symmetric . clearly , both conditions can be satisfied here provided the system size is large .",
    "large - scale dynamos , on the other hand , generate magnetic field with characteristic scale larger than that of the velocity .",
    "the latter types of dynamo are associated with flows lacking reflectional symmetry , i.e. helical flows , and an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that in the nonlinear regime it is often difficult to distinguish unambiguously between large- and small - scale dynamo action , and have introduced instead the idea of a system - scale dynamo , as one that produces magnetic structures comparable in size to the system scale irrespective of the scale of the velocity .",
    "the fact that , here , the scale at which the magnetic spectrum peaks is comparable with the dissipation scale and it is asymptotically independent of the system size indicates that the dynamo operating here is of the small - scale type @xcite .",
    "dynamos of this type have no manifest inverse cascade of ( magnetic ) helicity , they can lead to the production of magnetic energy but not of substantial magnetic flux . in the specific context of mri driven turbulence",
    "a small - scale dynamo will not give rise to a ",
    "turbulent \" transport of angular momentum .",
    "when regarded in the general scheme of dynamo theory , this result is actually not that surprising since the underlying flow is not strongly helical , and therefore , there is no a priori reason to expect an efficient inverse cascade .",
    "this brings us to the second issue , which relates to the astrophysical significance of these types of mri solutions . clearly , it is to be expected that this type of dynamo excitation will be prevalent in most ( electrically conducting ) discs .",
    "its role in the transport of angular momentum , and therefore in regulating the accretion rate , however will be negligible . with things as they stand , the only dynamo solutions that might have an impact on the angular momentum transport are those with an efficient inverse cascade .",
    "interestingly , this implies that by their very nature such solutions should not be treated in the context of a local approximation .",
    "we find ourselves in a paradoxical situation in which if a solution is astrophysically relevant it can not properly be described by a local model , and if it can be described by a local model then it is astrophysically irrelevant .",
    "the third issue concerns the role of numerics in influencing what we understand , or think we understand in computational astrophysics .",
    "it is interesting that the asymptotic behavior that eventually emerges according to the present study is in many ways the most natural : that consonant with a subcritical small - scale dynamo instability developing in a system where there are not many reasons to expect otherwise .",
    "likewise , the scaling behavior for the cases with weak imposed fluxes is asymptotically the one that makes most sense given the symmetries of the equations . yet , their numerical realizations were somewhat long in the making , and had not been reported in the literature to date .",
    "the reason is that these asymptotic regimes requires a substantial dynamic range to manifest themselves . in this particular case , this was achieved by a combination of high resolution and high accuracy numerics .",
    "if we had tried to obtain the correct limiting behaviors with the less accurate codes , it would have been prohibitive .",
    "finally , it behooves us , to compare the conclusions of the present study with those of related studies in which different scaling behaviors have been observed .",
    "of particular relevance are the work of @xcite who also consider unstratified shearing boxes but with non periodic boundary conditions ; the work of @xcite who has the same set up as ours but with explicit diffusivities ; and the work of @xcite who include stratification .",
    "in all these cases the authors report that the problem of convergence as stated above , is absent . in the present context",
    ", these conclusions can be attributed to one or more of the following possibilities : the simulations are not in the asymptotic regime because of limited resolution and/or accuracy ; the extra physics has engendered an inverse cascade  i.e .",
    "the type of dynamo action has changed from small - scale to large - scale ; the extra physics has changed the nature of the subcritical dynamo instability and has caused it to become of the system - size type .",
    "the last two possibilities are related but distinct .",
    "they both refer to circumstances that lead to the production of large scale magnetic fields , but in a large - scale dynamo the velocity correlation length remains small , it is only the magnetic structures that become large ; in a system - scale dynamo both the velocity and magnetic structures grow in size until they occupy the largest available scale  the system size  hence the name @xcite .",
    "we begin by discussing the work of @xcite .",
    "they consider unstratified shearing box simulations with boundary conditions at the upper and lower boundaries corresponding to impenetrable , stress - free velocities and vertical magnetic fields .",
    "the distinctive feature of these conditions is that they allow a flux of magnetic helicity in and out of the box .",
    "this has been advocated by several authors as a feature that might be beneficial to large - scale dynamo action ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the calculations are carried out with explicit diffusivities and the authors report that the effective angular momentum transport is substantial and insensitive to variations in the values of both the magnetic reynolds and prandtl numbers .",
    "the morphology of the solutions is dramatically different from the periodic cases , with two large current boundary layers forming in the vicinity of the upper boundaries and the generation of a coherent nearly uniform azimuthal field .",
    "all these findings are consistent with the activation of a large - scale type dynamo .",
    "there remains to be seen if these solutions persist at higher resolutions , as well as how they map to a global geometry .",
    "these issues notwithstanding , the @xcite solutions are quite remarkable and could potentially have considerable astrophysical significance .",
    "next , we discuss stratification @xcite .",
    "its presence drives two new effects : it introduces a new spatial scale in the problem , namely the vertical scale height that breaks the symmetry of the homogeneous , periodic models , and it also introduces buoyancy forces associated with thermal , pressure , and magnetic pressure fluctuations .",
    "it is not unlikely that these new effects could modify the type of dynamo action and drive flows and field coherent on scales comparable with the scale height .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see how the solutions behave as the simulation size is increased for fixed scale height .",
    "such a study would be numerically very demanding but astrophysically very useful .    finally , we consider the recent results of @xcite .",
    "they report that when explicit diffusivities are included , the angular momentum transport becomes independent of resolution ",
    "the convergence problem goes away .",
    "if this result has a physical basis , it implies that the presence or absence of an inverse cascade and the type of associated dynamo action ( large - scale as as opposed to small - scale ) depends on the detailed form of the diffusivities .",
    "the dynamo is small - scale for all three types of numerical diffusivities considered here and in other similar studies , and large - scale for  physical \" diffusivities .",
    "although this possibility is not inconceivable , it is somewhat peculiar .",
    "it implies that the type of dynamo action is determined not by the symmetries of the problem , or large - scale features , but by the micro - physics . if correct it is a remarkable result .",
    "another possibility , is that the simulations are not in the asymptotic regime . to explore this possibility",
    "we note that the study by @xcite was carried out by incorporating explicit diffusivities into the zeus code . in order for the explicit diffusivities to be correctly represented they must give rise to boundary layers whose size is not smaller than those arising from truncation errors .",
    "thus the dynamic range of a code with numerical diffusivities gives an upper bound on the dynamic range achievable with the same code , the same resolution and explicit diffusivities .",
    "now , zeus has an order of accuracy comparable to the code with quadratic reconstruction , thus we can ask the following question . what is the resolution that we need with the quadratic code to see the same asymptotic behavior we observe with the mp5 code ? this can be estimated by comparing the curves in figure [ fig : maxw ] and taking the ratio in resolutions for which the curves corresponding to the ppm and mp5 code have similar slopes .",
    "this exercise gives a factor close to 4 .",
    "a more careful analysis comparing boundary layers in a channel flow problem yields a similar estimate .",
    "thus our conclusion is that our quadratic code requires a resolution exceeding 1000 grid - points to reproduce the asymptotic behavior observed by the mp5 code with 256 grid - points . since the highest resolution in the work by @xcite was 512 grid - points it is possible that their results may not yet be in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation sponsored center for magnetic self organization at the university of chicago .",
    "calculations were performed at cineca ( bologna , italy ) thanks to support by inaf and at caspur ( rome , italy ) ."
