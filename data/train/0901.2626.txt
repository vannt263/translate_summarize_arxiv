    "electronic interference is one of the main issues in mesoscopic physics .",
    "it has been experimentally studied in various systems such as a quantum ring@xcite and an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer ( emzi).@xcite    the interference is reduced by the dephasing and by the phase averaging . in the dephasing , an electron loses its phase due to the interactions with other particles during its propagation along interference paths .",
    "electron - electron interaction is known to be the main source of the dephasing at low temperature .",
    "the properties of the interaction - induced dephasing vary from systems to systems.@xcite on the other hand , in the phase averaging , each electron does not lose its phase but experiences a different phase shift .",
    "then , the measured interference signal , which is the average over electrons , can be suppressed .",
    "the phase averaging appears even in noninteracting systems under a finite bias voltage or at finite temperature , as electrons in the finite energy window have different momentum and thus different phase shifts .",
    "recently , meier and the coworkers experimentally investigated a quantum ring capacitively coupled to a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime.@xcite they measured the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm interference of the ring , and simultaneously detected electron current along a separate circuit containing the dot .",
    "the amplitude shows a dip , when the dot has degenerate states with different excess charges and thus shows a coulomb - blockade peak of electron conductance .",
    "the dip was qualitatively explained  @xcite as the phase averaging , in which the phase accumulation of an electron along the ring depends on the occupation of the dot .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the interference reduction , which has not been reported yet and is the aim of the present work , will be interesting and useful , as it comes from charge fluctuations in a _",
    "single _ resonance level , rather than those in macroscopic systems , thus contains the information of the resonance .",
    "note that there have been a theoretical study  @xcite on the dephasing due to a macroscopic gate nearby the interferometer , and lots of studies@xcite on the properties ( such as decoherence ) of the dot affected by its capacitive coupling to a conducting wire .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider an electronic interferometer ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) capacitively coupled to a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime , and study the reduction of the interference visibility @xmath0 due to the charge fluctuation of the dot ; other sources  @xcite of the reduction are omitted here .",
    "we focus on the regime of @xmath1 , where the reduction results from the phase averaging rather than the dephasing .",
    "here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are electron dwell time of the dot and electron flight time @xmath3 through the interferometer region coupled to the dot , respectively .",

    "the length of the interferometer region coupled to the dot is denoted as @xmath19 .",

    ", by studying the fluctuation spectra of @xmath12 and @xmath44 , and they will deviate from eqs .",

    "note that the fluctuation spectra will be affected by the back - action from @xmath43 to @xmath144 except for @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "the limiting case of @xmath146 is likely to be hardly found in a realistic situation such as in ref .  .",
    "for this case , our assumption that @xmath12 has no spatial dependence over the coupling region is not valid , and other approaches  @xcite may be helpful .",
    "we have investigated the reduction of the interference visibility in an electronic interferometer capacitively coupled to a quantum dot .",
    "the reduction appears when the dot shows coulomb blockade resonances .",
    "the features of the resonant reduction of the visibility are different from the dephasing effect in an interferometer coupled to a macroscopic gate .",
    "our result of the visibility reduction can be used for the detection of single charges , and provide a model for a local charge trap@xcite ( unintentionally ) formed nearby an electronic interferometer .",
