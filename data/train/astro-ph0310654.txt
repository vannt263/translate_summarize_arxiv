    "due to its distinctive chemical evolutionary history , the single globular cluster @xmath0 cen certainly deserves mention in a meeting on the origin of the elements . being the most massive known galactic globular cluster , with a mass of @xmath2 ( merritt , meylan , & mayor 1997 ) , it is almost as massive as a small dwarf spheroidal galaxy , such as sculptor ( @xmath3 ; mateo 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that @xmath0 cen is the surviving remnant of a larger system , such as a small galaxy , which was captured into a retrograde galactic orbit in the distant past ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ; gnedin et al .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath0 cen was the topic of a recent meeting ( in 2001 ) , where all aspects of its nature were discussed ; a large number of topics were covered , not just its chemical evolution , and this broader view of the cluster is well presented in the proceedings of that meeting ( van leeuwen , hughes , & piotto 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath0 cen displays a number of fascinating traits that need to be noted in order to place it within the larger context of chemical evolution in various types of stellar systems or populations .",
    "first , @xmath0 cen is the only known globular cluster to exhibit a large degree of chemical self - enrichment in all elements studied .",
    "its iron abundance , for example , ranges from [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.0 , at the low end , up to @xmath50.40 , where the bracket notation is defined as [ a / b ] = log(@xmath6/@xmath7)@xmath8 @xmath9 log(@xmath6/@xmath7)@xmath10 .",
    "the signature of this abundance spread was first detected as a large width in ( @xmath11 ) color of the giant branch in @xmath0 cen from the photographic color - magnitude diagram of woolley ( 1966 ) .",
    "this giant branch `` width '' was confirmed photoelectrically by cannon & stobie ( 1973 ) , who suggested that the color spread was due to varying metallicity .",
    "the inferred range in the heavy - element abundances ( specifically the calcium abundance ) was verified spectroscopically by freeman & rodgers ( 1975 ) using low - resolution spectra .",
    "a second important trait of @xmath0 cen is that the abundance distribution of the elements evolved in a most peculiar way as the metallicity ( e.g. , the fe or ca abundance ) increased .",
    "as noted by lloyd evans ( 1977 ) , the ba  ii @xmath124554   line in @xmath0 cen giants is considerably stronger than in 47 tuc giants of similar luminosity and metallicity . in a following paper , lloyd evans ( 1983 )",
    "identified a cool population of giants in @xmath0 cen with strong zro bands , a characteristic of the @xmath13-process heavy - element - rich ms and s stars .",
    "both ba and zr are produced in slow neutron capture ( @xmath13-process ) nucleosynthesis that occurs during shell he - burning thermal pulses in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars : recent extensive reviews covering the @xmath13-process and agb evolution can be found in wallerstein et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and busso , gallino , & wasserburg ( 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 cen ms and s stars identified by lloyd evans are of lower luminosity than typical galactic or magellanic cloud ms and s stars , which are agb stars undergoing thermal pulses and the dredge - up of @xmath14c and @xmath13-process neutron capture elements . since the giants found to be @xmath13-process rich in @xmath0 cen are not luminous enough to be thermally pulsing agb stars ( and , thus , could not have self - enriched their own atmospheres with @xmath14c and @xmath13-process elements )",
    ", lloyd evans ( 1983 ) argued that these chemically peculiar stars , which tend to be the more metal - rich stars , formed from gas that had been heavily enriched in @xmath13-process elements .",
    "such an enrichment would presumably have been driven by extensive pollution from a previous population of agb stars .",
    "subsequent high - resolution spectroscopic abundance studies of @xmath0 cen giants by francois , spite , & spite ( 1988 ) , paltoglou & norris ( 1989 ) , and vanture , wallerstein , & brown ( 1994 ) found that the @xmath13-process elemental abundances ( such as y , zr , ba , or nd ) increase as the overall metallicity ( i.e. [ fe / h ] ) increases ; the @xmath13-process increase is enormous relative to other elements ( such as ca , fe , or ni ) .",
    "these detailed abundance studies confirm the lloyd evans hypothesis that there is a large @xmath13-process component involved in the overall chemical evolution within @xmath0 cen .    a third trait that defines the character of @xmath0 cen is that it is not only chemically peculiar , but also dynamically complex .",
    "based on ca abundances derived from low - resolution spectra , norris , freeman , & mighell ( 1996 ) identified two distinct populations : a `` metal - poor '' component , with [ ca / h ] @xmath4 @xmath91.4 and containing about 80% of the stars , and a `` metal - rich '' one comprising the other 20% , with [ ca / h ] @xmath4 @xmath90.9 .",
    "later work by norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using radial velocities of the cluster members , revealed that the metal - poor and metal - rich populations were kinematically distinct .",
    "the metal - poor component is rotating ( with @xmath15 @xmath4 5 km s@xmath16 ) , while the metal - rich component is not .",
    "the metal - rich population is also more centrally condensed and has a lower velocity dispersion ( or is kinematically cooler ) .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) interpreted these observations as being due to some type of merger in the proto-@xmath0 cen environment .",
    "more complexity was added to the two - population abundances and kinematics from norris et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) by the discovery of increasingly metal - rich components ( a third and a fourth ) by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , based on red giant branch ( rgb ) morphology .",
    "these additional metal - rich populations comprise about 5% of all @xmath0 cen members .",
    "these newly discovered metal - rich stars became even more interesting when ferraro , bellazzini , & pancino ( 2002 ) found them to display coherent , bulk motion with respect to the rest of the cluster stars .",
    "a subpopulation with its own distinct space motion would suggest a merger , and probably a recent one , as playing a role in the evolution of @xmath0 cen to its present state .",
    "this potentially fascinating result has been questioned by platais et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who point out that a color term has introduced systematic effects in the proper motions that could be responsible for the apparent bulk motion of the most metal - rich @xmath0 cen members .",
    "this question remains open and no doubt will lead to new observations .",
    "recent accurate color - magnitude diagrams have also revealed details of the star formation history of @xmath0 cen than can shed light on the nature of its chemical evolution .",
    "hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) used strmgren photometry to derive an age - metallicity relation .",
    "they found that the metal - poor stars were typically 3 gyr older than the metal - rich population , and then argue that this indicates that @xmath0 cen enriched itself over this time scale .",
    "hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) also studied a large sample of @xmath0 cen stars using strmgren photometry and came to essentially the same conclusions as hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) , although hilker & richtler suggest a slightly longer time scale of @xmath56 gyr for chemical enrichment . a very large color - magnitude diagram study ( with 130,000 stars ) by lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) points to discrete , multiple stellar populations in @xmath0 cen  not necessarily a continuous distribution of ages .",
    "their modeling of the color - magnitude diagram suggests four distinct populations in @xmath0 cen .",
    "this result may then agree quite nicely with the abundance distributions from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) , norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , or pancino et al .",
    "although norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) only identified two populations , while suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) pointed to a metal - rich tail , the two most metal - rich components in @xmath0 cen only comprise a tiny fraction ( @xmath55% ) of the total number of members .",
    "we will now focus the remainder of this review on trying to understand the detailed nature of chemical evolution in @xmath0 cen , within the framework of the metallicities , kinematics , ages , and star formation history as discussed above .",
    "a simple picture of its chemical evolutionary history will be sketched , with the predictions from this simple model compared to the observed abundances .",
    "both suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) and norris et al . (",
    "1996 ) present relatively large samples of metallicities in @xmath0 cen members derived from low - resolution spectra of the ca  ii infrared ( ir ) triplet lines .",
    "both studies endeavored to obtain unbiased samples of stars , with no selection criteria based on color or abundance .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) focused on giants brighter than @xmath17 and presented a sample containing 521 stars .",
    "suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) studied two separate samples , one of subgiants with @xmath18 magnitudes similar to those of the horizontal branch ( 199 members ) , as well as a sample of bright giants ( 144 members ) . in both studies , the ca  ii equivalent widths were transformed onto metallicity scales by using calibrating globular clusters ( 47 tuc , m4 , ngc 6752 and ngc 6397 for norris et al . and 47 tuc , m71 , m4 , and ngc 6397 for suntzeff & kraft ) , with suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) tying their scale to the cluster [ fe / h ] values , while norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) opted to tie their scale to their own calibration in the clusters of [ ca / h ] .",
    "the resulting metallicity distributions from suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) and norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are shown in figure 1.1 .",
    "both studies find essentially the same distribution , but calibrated on different scales ( [ fe / h ] and [ ca / h ] ) .",
    "there is a sharp cutoff in the number of stars toward low metallicities , with the sharpness set by the observational uncertainty .",
    "there is also a well - defined high - metallicity `` tail '' containing about 20% of the members .",
    "suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) tried fitting the metallicity distribution with a simple one - zone model of chemical evolution with instantaneous recycling .",
    "no satisfactory fit to the @xmath0 cen metallicity distribution could be found from such a model ; large effective yields from primary nucleosynthesis products are needed to fit the metal - rich tail , but such yields result in too broad of a peak in the metallicity distribution .",
    "lower effective yields , which can fit the width of the main metallicity peak , fail to fit the metal - rich tail .",
    "suntzeff & kraft do point out that these two problems can be overcome if two generations of star formation are considered .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) consider slightly different types of models , where the cluster enrichment has occurred within a cloud of gas having some initial heavy - element enrichment , followed by further enrichment from stellar ejecta , with the total metallicity distribution being fit by two such components .",
    "such a model can fit the [ ca / h ] distribution , indicating two rather distinct populations in @xmath0 cen .",
    "this population picture fits nicely into the later kinematic work from norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which finds two kinematic components that correlate with the metallicity , as discussed here in  1.1 .    one possible consistent picture for the chemical evolution within @xmath0 cen that fits the metallicity distributions discussed above would contain an initial population of stars with a very narrow range of metallicity : suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) estimate @xmath19[fe / h]@xmath20 0.07 dex , based upon the sharpness of the low - metallicity cutoff .",
    "this narrow metallicity range is similar to what is found in other globular clusters , where typically @xmath19[fe / h]@xmath20 0.05 dex ( suntzeff 1993 ) .",
    "this initial generation of stars then pollutes the immediate interstellar medium ( ism ) within the proto-@xmath0 cen , and a second generation of stars is formed from this enriched material , with the new stars forming from different amounts of enriched material , giving rise to the broad high - metallicity tail .",
    "this simple picture does not address the cause of the second star formation episode , or whether such a scenario might be related to some sort of merger event , but it can , in very broad terms , account for the overall metallicity distribution .",
    "additional support for a model using discrete star formation episodes comes from the more recent work on the rgb morphology from pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the color - magnitude diagram from lee et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : both studies identify four distinct populations . as the most metal - rich third and fourth components account for only @xmath55% of the members , just considering a two - epoch star formation model , as suggested by suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) and norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , is probably adequate as a start .",
    "such a model will be considered by us in  1.4 ; however , before applying this model , a more detailed discussion of the nature of the various types of elements involved in the chemical evolution within @xmath0 cen is in order .    [ [ abundance - ratios - and - the - nature - of - chemical - evolution - in - omega - cen ] ] abundance ratios and the nature of chemical evolution in @xmath0 cen ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    within a given stellar population , chemical evolution is driven by nucleosynthesis averaged over the stellar mass range and subsequent dispersal of this processed material back into the ism .",
    "this heavy - element enrichment over time depends on such processes as star formation history , internal stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis as a function of mass , how stars return their processed ejecta back into the ism , and whether some of the stellar ejecta can be lost from the system . by increasing the number of elements considered in an abundance analysis",
    ", we can obtain a more detailed picture of chemical evolution within @xmath0 cen .",
    "in particular , elements that arise from different types of nucleosynthetic processes occurring in stars of differing masses provide more constraints on the chemical evolution .",
    "* high - mass stars ( @xmath21 ) that explode as supernovae of type ii ( sne  ii ) and that contribute much of the heavy - element enrichment , such as o , mg , si , ca , ti , and some fe , as well as the heavy neutron - rich , rapid neutron capture elements , personified , for example , by the element europium . such stars can contribute their processed ejecta to a population s chemical enrichment on fairly short time scales ( @xmath22 yr ) . * low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath23 ) that evolve onto the rgb and agb and lose much of their mass via low - velocity stellar winds as red giants .",
    "such winds contain material processed through the stellar interior that has been mixed to the surface via various red giant dredge - up episodes .",
    "the red giant winds from agb stars might contribute significant yields of @xmath14c or @xmath24n , and substantial amounts of the heavy elements produced by the slow capture of neutrons , the @xmath13-process , as typified by such elements as y , zr , ba , or la . these types of stars will contribute to chemical evolution over fairly long time scales of @xmath25 10@xmath2610@xmath27 yr .",
    "* supernovae of type ia ( sne  ia ) , which almost certainly result from mass transfer in a binary driving a white dwarf over the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "such supernovae are expected to provide very large mass yields of fe , and these systems can dominate fe production in a stellar population over long time scales of @xmath51 gyr .",
    "this is an admittedly thin sketch of stellar nucleosynthesis , but this is a limited review and the above points allow us to now investigate a few of the interesting points concerning chemical evolution within @xmath0 cen in light of basic stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the ability to detect and analyze a number of different elements , some of quite low abundance or represented by weak spectral lines , requires high - resolution spectra , with @xmath28 , and preferably even higher , with @xmath29 .",
    "the results from high - resolution spectroscopic studies that are discussed here come from a number of studies that combine both high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath4 50100 or better ) .",
    "the largest such study to date is that of norris & da  costa ( 1995 ) , who studied some 40 red giant members , but sacrificed a bit in s / n .",
    "smaller samples , but with better s / n , include those of francois et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , smith , cunha , & lambert ( 1995 ) , smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , or vanture , wallerstein , & suntzeff ( 2002 ) .",
    "all of the studies mentioned above include a wide range of elements , while additional high - resolution analyses by brown & wallerstein ( 1993 ) or pancino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) contain elements produced by sne  ii and sne  ia , but do not include analyses of the @xmath13-process elements .",
    "cunha et al . ( 2002 ) probe some 40 @xmath0 cen giants , but focus on their copper abundances .",
    "all of these high - resolution results will be combined and discussed in the following two subsections , with the goal being to define the nature of the nucleosynthesis that is needed to explain the chemical enrichment observed in @xmath0 cen .          as first pointed out by lloyd evans ( 1983 ) , the metal - enriched stars in @xmath0 cen exhibit an overabundance of @xmath13-process elements .",
    "this increase is illustrated quantitatively in figure 1.2 , where we plot [ y / fe ] ( top panel ) , [ la / fe ] ( middle panel ) , and [ eu / fe ] ( bottom panel ) versus a(fe ) , where a(x ) = log  [ n(x)/n(h ) ] + 12 , from a number of different studies .",
    "we note that we have examined each abundance study to ascertain the sources of their respective @xmath30-values and have put all of these different results on a common scale , when possible ( we also adopt a solar fe abundance of a(fe ) = 7.50 ) .",
    "yttrium and lanthanum are picked to represent the @xmath13-process , with y ( z = 39 ) being a `` light '' @xmath13-process element and la ( z = 57 ) being a `` heavy '' @xmath13-process element .",
    "the abundance ratio of light to a heavy @xmath13-process elements is a diagnostic of the exposure to neutrons experienced by the material .",
    "both elements are also spectroscopically well - observed species .",
    "europium is included as a monitor of @xmath31-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is thought that most of the @xmath13-process abundances result from nucleosynthesis in agb stars , while the @xmath31-process elements are synthesized in sne  ii ( for a review of these neutron capture processes and their relation to stellar evolution , see wallerstein et al .",
    "sample error bars are shown in the middle panel of figure 1.2 to illustrate approximate internal abundance uncertainties in each study ( adding error bars to each point would overwhelm the plotted points ) .",
    "all of the high - resolution studies highlighted in these discussions use similar quality spectra and similar analysis techniques . as the fe abundance increases in @xmath0 cen , the @xmath13-process component increases dramatically ( y and la ) , with no such increase in the @xmath31-process ( eu ) .",
    "the enormous [ @xmath13-process / fe ] abundance ratios found in the general population of the more metal - rich @xmath0  cen stars have not been found in general stellar populations associated with the milky way halo or disk .",
    "recent abundances derived in red giants of the sagitarrius dwarf galaxy by smecker - hane & mcwilliam ( 2004 ) , however , do show large @xmath13-process to iron ratios as observed in @xmath0  cen .",
    "the solid curves in figure 1.2 are predictions from a simple two - component star formation plus mixing scheme of chemical evolution that is discussed in  1.4 .",
    "a key point of figure 1.2 is that the increase in [ la / fe ] is larger than the increase in [ y / fe ] , meaning that the overall ratio of la / y in the @xmath13-process material that has enriched @xmath0 cen has a value of [ la / y ] @xmath4 + 0.4 to + 0.5 .",
    "this excess of la over y is a signature of low - mass , low - metallicity agb stars driving the @xmath13-process ; busso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) provide a detailed review of the various types of @xmath13-process abundance distributions expected from agb stars of various masses and metallicities .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) compared the heavy - element abundances in @xmath0 cen with predictions from models of agb nucleosynthesis at the appropriate metallicities and found that 1.5 @xmath32 models yield the best overall fits to the @xmath13-process abundance distributions in the @xmath13-process - enriched members .",
    "the heavy - element abundances in the @xmath0  cen stars thus point to low - mass agb stars as dominating the @xmath13-process enrichment in this cluster .",
    "the lifetimes of these lower - mass stars are of order 3 gyr , pointing to a protracted period of star formation , evolution , and chemical enrichment in @xmath0  cen .",
    "this time scale agrees with the results from hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) and hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) , who find age spreads of 36 gyr based upon strmgren photometry and main sequence isochrones ( for hughes & wallerstein ) , and red giant isochrones ( for hilker & richtler ) .",
    "as reviewed by mcwilliam ( 1997 ) , it has been shown observationally by many investigations over many years that even - z elements , such as o , mg , si , s , ca , and ti , are overabundant relative to fe in almost all galacic metal - poor stars .",
    "this mix of elements is often referred to collectively as the @xmath33-elements , although this collectivization should not be taken to imply that these elements are all produced in uniform ratios in a single type of object .",
    "all of the @xmath33-elements are produced in sne  ii ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) , but their respective yields depend on such variables as stellar mass or metallicity .",
    "the general trend found in the majority of metal - poor galactic disk and halo stars is that , for iron abundances of [ fe / h]@xmath20 1.0 , the values of [ @xmath33/fe ] @xmath4 + 0.2 to + 0.6 and are roughly constant with metallicity , but having different values of [ @xmath33/fe ] for the different elements . at iron abundances [ fe / h]@xmath251.0 , there is a quasi - linear decrease in [ @xmath33/fe ] toward 0.0 as [ fe / h ] approaches 0.0 .",
    "the behavior of [ @xmath33/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] is usually interpreted to result from the time delay between sn  ii contributions to chemical evolution relative to the contributions from sne  ia .",
    "the beginning of the decrease in the values of [ @xmath33/fe ] is then due to the onset of sne  ia , which begin to add large amounts of fe into a population s pool of heavy elements .",

    "this abundance pattern reveals the effects of h - burning by both the on part of the cno cycles , as well as the ne - na cycle .",
    "it is still not clear to what extent these o and na ( as well as al and mg ) abundance variations observed in the globular cluster - like populations may be due to red giant mixing within the giant itself , or patterns that were imprinted on the currently observed stars by a previous stellar generation .",

    ". there may be slight increases in the values of each of these [ @xmath33/fe ] ratios as a(fe ) increases ( with slopes of @xmath5 + 0.1 to + 0.2 dex per dex ) , although the significance of these possible trends needs to be assessed with a larger , homogeneous analysis .",
    "the positive values of [ @xmath33/fe ] in the @xmath0 cen subpopulations rgb - mp and rgb - int indicate chemical evolution in an environment in which sne  ii control the nucleosynthesis ( with little , or no significant , contribution from sne  ia ) .",

    "this may indicate that the rgb - a members are showing measurable amounts of fe produced from sne  ia .",
    "if so , this is probably not due to a simple time scale difference between chemical evolution in rgb - mp and rgb - int compared to rgb - a .",
    "recall from  1.3.1 that the substantial build - up in the @xmath13-process abundances from rgb - mp to rgb - int requires time scales of @xmath513 gyr .",

    "cunha et al . ( 2003 ) found that a sample of five @xmath0 cen giants displayed values of [ f / o ] that were significantly lower than the [ f / o ] ratios found in in galactic and lmc field red giants having the same oxygen abundances .",
    "they also found that the trend in [ f / o ] versus a(o ) defined by the galactic and lmc stars agreed reasonably well with the predictions of chemical evolutionary models from timmes , woosley , & weaver ( 1995 ) and alibes , labay , & canal ( 2001 ) , in which fluorine production is driven primarily by neutrino spallation off of @xmath35ne during sn core collapse , as described by woosley et al .",
    "these models predict a metallicity - dependent decline in [ f / o ] versus a(o ) of about 0.30 dex per dex .",
    "cunha et al . ( 2003 ) suggested a scenario to explain the behavior of [ f / o ] in @xmath0 cen ( as well as [ cu / fe ] ) , in comparison to the field - star behaviors in the galaxy and the lmc ( for fluorine ) , by considering the possible star formation history of @xmath0 cen .",
    "their working assumption is that @xmath0 cen underwent a few ( 24 ) well - separated star formation episodes many gyr ago : this assumption is motivated by the morphology of the color - magnitude diagram ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the simplest case of two star formation episodes ( that seem to account for @xmath595% of the members , as found in the [ ca / h ] distribution from norris et al .",
    "1996 ) , some fraction of ejecta from the first stellar generation is retained with the @xmath0 cen proto - system ( with only a small fraction of sne  ii retained , even less from sne  ia , but 100% of agb ejecta ) .",
    "this retained ejecta is then mixed with a reservoir of very metal - poor gas ; this reservoir may represent the infall , or merging , of a primordial ( or less chemically evolved ) cloud that might itself induce the second episode of star formation .",
    "if the newly added metal - poor gas and the ejecta gas are mixed inhomogeneously , stars of the second generation will have a spread of heavy - element abundances , as observed in @xmath0 cen .",
    "abundance ratios , on the other hand , will be nearly constant in all stars as long as the infalling ( or merging ) gas cloud is severely underabundant in those elements comprising a given ratio . if an abundance ratio from sne  ii is metallicity dependent , such as [ cu / fe ] or [ f / o ] , then this ratio will appear anomalous ( and will be @xmath5 constant with respect to [ fe / h ] or [ o / h ] ) when compared to stellar populations that form from gas that has undergone many star formation episodes in which stellar ejecta become well mixed with the ism . in a sense ,",
    "the abundance ratios carry the `` memory '' of the metallicities of the sne  ii that formed the bulk of the ejecta out of which they formed .",
    "a comparison using abundance ratios insensitive to sn  ii metallicity ( such as [ si / fe ] or [ ca / fe ] ) will appear normal , as is observed in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the basic picture of an initial population of stars in the proto-@xmath0 cen environment evolving and depositing ejecta , followed by a second stellar generation forming from a mixture of this ejecta and added metal - poor gas , can be tested for consistency by examining abundance ratios . in this scenario ,",
    "the more metal - rich members are stars that formed from larger fractions of ejecta from the first population .",
    "the limiting case would be a star that formed from pure first generation ejecta .",
    "thus , an approximate abundance distribution for the ejecta ( or lower - limit elemental abundances to this gas ) can be taken to be the abundances defined by the most metal - rich members of the second stellar generation .",
    "the additional metal - poor gas added to this mixture is taken to have much lower heavy - element abundances than the ejecta .",
    "the exact composition of this added gas is unknown , but limits to its metallicity can be deduced from the sharp low - metallicity cut - offs in the distributions derived by both suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) and norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; see figure 1.1 .",
    "both studies found that the sharpness ( in either [ fe / h ] or [ ca / h ] ) of this cut - off is set by their respective observational uncertainties : in principle , the low - metallicity cut - off could be a step function .",
    "this sharp boundary in the metallicity distribution at low values indicates that the gas in the proto-@xmath0 cen system was `` pre - enriched '' and well mixed , as discussed in the chemical models employed by norris et al .",
    "it is thus reasonable to use , as the composition of the added metal - poor gas that is incorporated into the second generation , this pre - enriched material that was already part of the proto-@xmath0 cen system . in this case , stars that formed from differing amounts of these two reservoirs of material should follow a `` mixing line '' going from the most metal - poor to the most metal - rich stars . referring back to figure 1.2 , where the heavy - element ratios of [ y / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , and [ eu / fe ] are shown , the solid curves show such mixing lines , with the initial abundances taken as those defined by the metal - poor population . as discussed in smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the heavy - element abundance distribution in the most metal - poor @xmath0 cen stars is characterized by an @xmath31-process distribution , but these abundances are then transformed into an @xmath13-process distribution as [ fe / h ] increases . the @xmath13-process distribution , with [ la / y ] @xmath4 + 0.5 and [ la / eu ] @xmath4 1.2 , is indicative of nucleosynthesis from low - mass , low - metallicity agb stars , as reviewed by busso et al .",
    "the mixing lines shown in figure 1.2 are fair representations of the observed abundances of y , la , and eu .",
    "further consistency checks can be conducted using other abundance ratios .",
    "the transition from an @xmath31-process - dominated heavy - element distribution in the metal - poor , first stellar generation to a second generation with a strong @xmath13-process component should appear as a changing [ la / y ] ratio ( the [ la / eu ] or [ y / eu ] ratios would be better , but most of the ( few ) eu abundances derived in @xmath0 cen stars are from the relatively small sample from smith et al .",
    "the top panel of figure 1.4 illustrates [ la / y ] versus a(fe ) from a number of studies of @xmath0 cen : note the very rapid rise in [ la / y ] as a function of the iron abundance .",
    "the solid curve is the mixing line as set by the same curves used in figure 1.2 .",
    "again , the simple two - component mixing model for chemical evolution in @xmath0 cen provides an adequate description of the observed abundances .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1.4 shows the results for [ cu / fe ] in @xmath0 cen from cunha et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and pancino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in galactic field halo stars ( sneden et al .",
    "1991 ; mishenina et al .",
    "2002 ) and other globular cluster stars ( simmerer et al . 2003 ) , values of [ cu / fe ] increase steadily as a(fe ) increases from @xmath54.7 to 6.5 ; this increase is interpreted as being due to metallicity - dependent sn  ii yields ( e.g. , simmerer et al .",
    "no such increase is observed in @xmath0 cen , and in the picture of a single - metallicity initial stellar population producing the sn  ii products from which a second generation of stars are born , a constant cu / fe ratio would be predicted , with the value of this ratio set by the metallicity of the first generation of sne  ii .",
    "such a constant copper to iron ratio is illustrated by the straight line in figure 1.4 , and this horizontal line is clearly a very good fit to the behavior of copper with iron .",
    "in addition , the value of [ cu / fe ] @xmath4 0.55 is the value found in field halo stars with a(fe ) @xmath4 5.5 ( see mishenina et al .",
    "2002 ) , which corresponds to the lowest metallicity @xmath0 cen stars .",

( 2002 ) .",
    "the large @xmath13-process abundance component , relative to elements produced in either sne  ii or sne  ia , in @xmath0 cen s chemical enrichment points to agb stars as playing a major role in chemical evolution ( relative to the galaxy ) .",
    "this could result from a different imf , although we prefer to suggest that selective retention of stellar ejecta is the cause , with sn ejecta being retained less efficiently than agb winds . continuing star formation in @xmath0 cen then results from the mixing of this stellar ejecta with additional gas arriving from outside of the spatial regions defined by the stars .",
    "we have taken this gas to be metal - poor , relative to the stellar ejecta , and find that the observed abundance trends can be fit by such a picture ( the solid curves in figures 1.2 and 1.4 ) .",
    "we have focused on describing the first two generations in @xmath0 cen for two reasons : ( 1 ) these first two stellar generations seem to account for 95% of the @xmath0 cen members ( suntzeff & kraft 1996 ; norris et al . 1996",
    "; pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) , and ( 2 ) the most metal - rich stars have yet to be analyzed in detail in terms of their abundance distributions .",
    "the chemical evolution discussed above is similar to a picture suggested by freeman ( 2002 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath0 cen is the surviving nucleus of a small galaxy , with its abundance spread being established by the infall of enriched stellar ejecta from the surrounding galaxy into the nucleus .",
    "this is a variation from the picture presented above in the sense that enriched material is not retained within the spatial extent of the stars , but arrives from outside .",
    "the freeman ( 2002 ) scenario may explain more easily the observed kinematic and angular momentum properties of @xmath0 cen s subpopulations .",
    "certainly larger samples of stars and more detailed abundance and kinematic studies will shed light on the details of the history of @xmath0 cen .",
