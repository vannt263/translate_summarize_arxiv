    "the bcd galaxy i  zw  18 is one of the most intriguing nearby objects . with @xmath11 , corresponding to 1/50 z@xmath12 ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) , it has the lowest nebular oxygen abundance of all known star - forming galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "it has a high gas fraction ( e.g. , van zee et al .",
    "1998 ) and extremely high star formation ( sf ) rate per unit mass ( searle & sargent 1972 ) , producing a blue young stellar population that dominates the integrated luminosity and color .",
    "all these observational evidences make i  zw  18 a chemically unevolved stellar system . as such , it has long been regarded as a possible example of a galaxy undergoing its first burst of star formation , hence a local analog to primordial galaxies in the distant universe.=-2    many hubble space telescope ( hst ) studies have focused on the evolutionary state of i  zw  18 .",
    "after other groups had already resolved the brightest individual stars in the galaxy , our group managed to detect fainter asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in hst / wfpc2 images with ages of at least several hundreds myr ( aloisi , tosi , & greggio 1999 ) .",
    "these results were confirmed by stlin ( 2000 ) through deep hst / nicmos imaging .",
    "more recently , izotov & thuan ( 2004 ; it04 ) presented new deep hst / acs imaging observations .",
    "their @xmath1 vs.  @xmath13 cmd shows no sign of an rgb ( i.e. , low - mass stars with ages @xmath14 - 13 gyr that are burning h in a shell around a he core ) at an assumed distance @xmath15 mpc .",
    "their conclusion is that the most evolved ( agb ) stars are not older than 500 myr and that i  zw  18 is a _ bona - fide _ young galaxy .",
    "this result was subsequently challenged by momany et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and our group ( tosi et al .",
    "2006 ) based on a better photometric analysis of the same data .",
    "this showed that many red sources do exist at the expected position of an rgb , and that their density in the cmd drops exactly where a rgb tip ( trgb , at the luminosity of the he flash ) would be expected .",
    "however , the small number statistics , large photometric errors , and incompleteness , did not allow a more conclusive statement.=-2    the actual nature of i  zw  18 has important cosmological implications . according to hierarchical formation scenarios , dwarf",
    "( @xmath16 @xmath17 10@xmath18 m@xmath12 ) galaxies should have been the first systems to collapse and start forming stars .",
    "indeed an rgb has been detected in all metal - poor dwarf irregular galaxies of the local group and bcds within @xmath15 mpc that have been imaged with hst ( e.g. , sbs  1415 + 437 , aloisi et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "i  zw  18 has remained the only elusive case so far .",
    "the lack of rgb evidence has also made it impossible to pinpoint the distance of i  zw  18 via the trgb method .",
    "its distance therefore continues to be debated . with a recession velocity of @xmath19 km s@xmath20 ,",
    "i  zw  18 has often been assumed to be at a distance of @xmath21 mpc ( @xmath22 = 75 kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 ) .",
    "correction for virgocentric infall implies a slightly larger distance between 10 and 14.5 mpc ( @xmath23 ; stlin 2000 ) .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that i  zw  18 should be as distant as 20 mpc to provide consistency between the cmd , the presence of wolf - rayet stars and the ionization state of the h  ii regions .",
    "but they suggested in it04 a shorter distance @xmath15 mpc from the brightness of agb stars.=-2    in this letter we present new @xmath0 and @xmath1 time - series photometry of i  zw  18 with hst / acs that allows the first detection and study of the galaxy s cepheid stars .",
    "our new data , once combined with the archival ones , also yield a better cmd than has been hitherto available , reaching about 1.5 mag below the trgb .",
    "the results demonstrate that i  zw  18 is actually farther away and older than previously believed .",
    "time - series photometry of i  zw  18 was collected with acs / wfc in 12 different epochs between 2005 october and 2006 january ( go program 10586 , pi aloisi ) . due to the failure of the f814w exposure in one of the 12 visits ( subsequently repeated ) , an additional epoch in f606w is available .",
    "total integration times of @xmath24 and @xmath25 s were obtained in f606w and f814w , respectively .",
    "the 4 optimally dithered single exposures per epoch per filter were registered by carefully measuring stars in the individual frames .",
    "the pipeline - calibrated exposures were then corrected for geometric distortion and co - added with cosmic - ray rejection using the multidrizzle software to create an image per epoch each filter .",
    "the images were drizzled onto a smaller pixel scale than the @xmath26 acs pixels , to take advantage of the small scale dithers and improve the @xmath27 for photometry .",
    "a similar procedure was used on all the single exposures to create a master image in both filters .",
    "similarly , the archival acs / wfc data in f555w and f814w ( go program 9400 , pi thuan ) taken over a period of 11 days in 2003 may - june were combined into a master image for a total integration time of @xmath28 and @xmath29 s in f555w and f814w , respectively .",
    "single images per epoch were also produced for the archival data ( 5 in f555w and 3 in f814w).=-2    the cmd shown in figure  1 was obtained by performing psf - fitting photometry with the daophot / allstar package ( stetson 1987 ) on the master images from our new and the archival data .",
    "aperture corrections were measured from stars in the frame and applied to all photometry .",
    "corrections for imperfect charge transfer efficiency ( riess & mack 2004 ) resulted to be negligible ( e.g. , @xmath30 in all filters for a red trgb star ) and were not applied .",
    "count rates were transformed to the johnson - cousins @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes using the transformations given by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which have been shown to be accurate to @xmath31 mag .",
    "the values shown and discussed hereafter are corrected for @xmath32 mag of galactic foreground extinction , but not for any extinction intrinsic to i  zw  18 . for conciseness , we refer to these magnitudes throughout this paper as @xmath0 and @xmath1 instead of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the two acs datasets were combined using several different approaches and rejection schemes .",
    "the results discussed here were obtained by demanding that stars should be detected in all the four deep images ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 for both datasets ) , yielding a catalog of @xmath35 stars . at the expense of some depth , this approach has the advantage of minimizing the number of false detections and therefore providing a relatively clean cmd .",
    "annibali et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) will present more details about the data reduction and photometric analysis , as well as a star formation history ( sfh ) analysis.=-2    psf - fitting photometry of the single epochs in both our own and the archival acs / wfc time - series data was performed with the daophotii / allstar / allframe package ( stetson 1987 , 1994 ) to search for and obtain light curves of the galaxy s variable stars .",
    "candidate variables were identified using four independent methods on the single - epoch images : _",
    "i. ) _ the optimal image subtraction technique and the package isis 2.2 ( alard 2000 ) , _ ii . ) _ the variability index ( welch & stetson 1993 ) , _ iii . )",
    "_ an independent psf - fitting photometry performed with the dophot program ( schechter , mateo , & saha 1993 ) to search for periodic variables as detailed in saha & hoessel ( 1990 ) , and _ iv . )",
    "_ visual inspection of a @xmath36 image , where each pixel is the @xmath36 value calculated from the corresponding pixels in the co - registered target images at all epochs .",
    "in addition , all suspected variables were examined by visually ` blinking ' the relevant spots in the images at the various epochs .",
    "the four procedures returned 4 confirmed variables .",
    "these are discussed in section  4 below and they are highlighted with open circles in the cmd of figure  1 .",
    "in addition , some 30 other objects were flagged as candidate variables , but we were generally unable to find convincing periods nor otherwise classify them .",
    "most of these objects are in the main body of izw18 , where crowding complicates the characterization of variables .",
    "at magnitudes brighter than @xmath37 mag , we find in the cmd the same star types previously detected with acs by it04 : main - sequence ( ms ) stars and their more evolved counterparts , i.e. , young supergiants ( sgs ) and agb stars .",
    "a `` blue plume '' which is the combined feature of ms stars and blue sgs ( evolved stars at the hot edge of their core he - burning phase ) , shows up near @xmath38 mag . at @xmath39 mag ,",
    "red sgs appear at magnitudes @xmath40 mag , while agb stars dominate in the magnitude range @xmath4127 mag and form the upper part of what we will call a `` red plume '' .",
    "the morphology of the agb star features compares well with the positions at which oxygen - rich and carbon - rich agb stars are predicted in evolutionary models ( e.g. , figure  12 of marigo , girardi , & chiosi 2003 ) .",
    "our acs data show that both the blue and red plumes extend down to much fainter magnitudes . but more importantly",
    ", they reveal the presence of a much older stellar population . indeed , below @xmath42 mag and around @xmath39 mag , we detect faint red stars exactly at the position where an rgb would be expected ( see the padua isochrones overplotted in figure  1 ) .",
    "the small median error around @xmath43 mag suggests that these faint red stars are not more massive younger stars with large photometric uncertainties .",
    "figure  2 shows the @xmath1-band luminosity function ( lf ) for stars in i  zw  18 cmd with red colors in the range @xmath441.5 mag . this lf presents a sharp drop towards brighter magnitudes , exactly as would be expected from a trgb .",
    "we used a savitzky - golay filtering technique developed by one of us ( r.  p.  v.  d.  m. ) and described in cioni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to determine the trgb magnitude .",
    "this yields @xmath45 mag , with the error bar being dominated by random uncertainties from the finite number of stars . at the metallicity of i  zw  18 ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the trgb discontinuity is @xmath46 ( bellazzini et al .",
    "this implies a distance modulus @xmath47 mag , i.e. , @xmath48 mpc , assuming that the evolved rgb stars have negligible intrinsic extinction ( see , e.g. , cannon et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the evidence for an rgb in i  zw  18 is further strengthened by comparison to another bcd , sbs  1415 + 437 , observed by us with a similar hst / acs set - up ( aloisi et al .",
    "this galaxy is not quite as metal poor as i  zw  18 ( @xmath49 ) and is nearer at @xmath50 mpc .",
    "but taking into account the differences in distance , corresponding to a @xmath51 mag , the two bcds have very similar lfs ( see figure  2 ) . since sbs 1415 + 437 has an unmistakable rgb sequence , this suggests that such an rgb sequence exists in i  zw  18 as well .",
    "the larger distance of i  zw  18 explains why with a similar observational setup we detect @xmath52 times fewer stars than in sbs 1415 + 437 .",
    "periods and classification in type of the 4 confirmed variable stars in i  zw  18 were derived from the study of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves separately , using gratis ( graphical analyzer of time series ) , custom software developed at the bologna observatory by p. montegriffo ( clementini et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) which uses both the lomb periodogram and light - curve fitting with a truncated fourier series .",
    "our acs / wfc data along with the archival ones span a total time baseline of about 2.5 years .",
    "the combined dataset allowed us to derive reliable periods for three of the four confirmed variable stars .",
    "all of them are classified as classical cepheids , both based on the shape of the light curve and the star s position on the cmd , where they all fall within or close enough to the instability strip for classical cepheids at the metallicity of i  zw  18 .",
    "one of these cepheids has a period of 8.63 d ( see figure  3 ) , well within the typical range used to statistically define period - luminosity ( pl ) relations in other galaxies .",
    "the other two cepheids have instead periods of 125.0 d and 129.8 d , respectively .",
    "this is much longer than ever observed in other galaxies , with the periods of cepheids typically being @xmath5380 d ( see udalski et al .",
    "1999 ; freedman et al .",
    "the precision of our period determinations is of the order of 1 - 2 decimal places .",
    "the residuals from the truncated fourier series that best fit the folded light curves are in the ranges 0.020.12 and 0.020.11 mag , in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively.=-2    the fourth confirmed variable is very bright and red .",
    "only a portion of its light curves is covered by our observations , leading to two possible alternative periodicities of 139 and 186 days respectively . in spite of the unusually long period and the red color , probably due to the star being blended by a red companion , both the high luminosity and the shape of the light curve",
    "suggest that this variable star is probably a classical cepheid as well . in absence of a well - determined period",
    ", it will not be considered further in our discussion below .",
    "a more detailed description of the sample of variable stars , and the data analysis performed to identify and characterize them , will be presented in fiorentino et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "this sample will be unique for probing the properties of variable stars at previously unexplored metallicities .",
    "here we focus merely on the implied distance of i  zw  18 .    new non - local time - dependent convective pulsating theoretical models of classical cepheids were computed at the proper metallicity of i  zw  18 ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) by our group ( marconi et al .  2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "these models build on our previous modeling expertise at higher metallicities ( e.g. , marconi , musella , & fiorentino 2005 ; fiorentino et al .",
    "the new models were used to obtain a theoretical reddening - free @xmath8 wesenheit relation that was directly compared to the wesenheit relation of the observed cepheids in order to infer a distance . the 8.63 d cepheid yields a distance modulus @xmath56 mag if a canonical mass - luminosity relation is assumed in the model computations and of @xmath57 mag in case of overluminous noncanonical models ( e.g. , caputo et al .  2005 ; fiorentino et al .",
    "we have no models yet that reproduce the very long - periods of the other two cepheids with well - determined periods , so the wesenheit relation needs to be extrapolated at such long periods to obtain a distance .",
    "but if we do this , the average of all three cepheids yields a very similar distance , @xmath58 .",
    "the cepheid distance estimates of i  zw  18 are in excellent agreement with our new trgb distance .",
    "this agreement supports the view that the feature identified in figure  1 is indeed the trgb , and therefore , that i  zw  18 does indeed have rgb stars . in turn",
    ", this implies that the galaxy can not have formed in the last @xmath14 gyr .",
    "moreover , the rgb stars are unlikely to be as young as 12 gyr , because for such ages the trgb is up to @xmath59 mag fainter than the standard candle value used here that applies to populations with ages @xmath60 gyr ( e.g. , figure  2 of barker , sarajedini , & harris 2004 )",
    ".    the extraordinary long periods of several of the i  zw  18 classical cepheids deserve some further comments .",
    "they could be a metallicity effect , since i  zw  18 is the lowest metallicity galaxy where cepheids have been observed .",
    "they could also be related to the peculiar sfh of this bcd , since i  zw  18 is currently experiencing a strong starburst that makes it more likely to detect more massive ( i.e. , brighter and shorter - lived ) and thus longer - period cepheids than in more regular ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "particularly striking is also the lack of observed cepheids with periods anywhere between @xmath52120 days .",
    "we attribute this absence to the lack of a detectable sf activity in i  zw  18 at the epochs when the missing cepheids should have formed . indeed , once we scale the sfh derived by aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from 10 mpc to the new distance derived here , we expect few stars in the mass range 620 m@xmath12 ( corresponding to pulsation periods of @xmath21120 days ) currently in the instability strip .",
    "we have obtained new deep hst / acs observations of i  zw  18 that provide improved insight into the evolutionary state of this benchmark metal - poor bcd .",
    "our results indicate that this galaxy contains rgb stars , in agreement with findings for other local metal - poor bcds studied with hst . underlying old ( @xmath3 gyr ) populations are therefore present in even the most metal - poor systems , so they must have started forming stars at @xmath61 .",
    "deeper studies ( well below the trgb ) will be needed to pinpoint the exact onset of sf in these galaxies .",
    "we also find that our trgb distance of i  zw  18 , @xmath62 mpc , which is confirmed by our cepheids results , places the galaxy farther away than the values @xmath63 mpc that have often been assumed in previous work .",
    "this may explain why it has remained difficult for so long to unambiguously detect or rule out the presence of old resolved ( rgb ) stars in this galaxy .",
