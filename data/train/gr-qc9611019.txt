    "the undeniable success of the theory of the generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum vacuum fluctuations during an inflationary era in the early universe was its ability to correctly predict in advance three main properties of the recently discovered ( non - dipole ) angular fluctuations @xmath6 of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature .",
    "these predictions are : a ) the multipole power spectrum of the fluctuations that is approximately flat for low multipoles ( @xmath7 ) ; b ) the right location and amplitude of the first acoustic ( or `` doppler '' ) peak of @xmath8 at @xmath9 ; c ) the gaussian statistics of the fluctuations ( see , e.g. , the 4-year cobe results for the spectrum  @xcite and statistics  @xcite of the fluctuations with @xmath10 , and the results of the saskatoon-95 experiment for @xmath11  @xcite and the cat experiment for @xmath12  @xcite ) . of course",
    ", this does not exclude alternative theories of the early universe ( e.g. , topological defects ) provided they are able to produce approximately the same observational predictions .",
    "however , it is clear that we can and even must seriously investigate quantum - gravitational effects in the early universe because of the actual observability of their consequences at present time .    at this point ,",
    "one of the most important and interesting questions of this theory arises .",
    "the initial perturbations generated during an inflationary stage were quantum , relativistic and gravitational since their dimensionless amplitude contains all three fundamental constants : the planck constant @xmath13 , the light velocity @xmath14 and the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath15 ( below we will take @xmath16 unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath17 measured today , on the other hand , are certainly classical ( though stochastic ) .",
    "thus , some mechanism describing the quantum - to - classical transition of the perturbations is required .",
    "what was explicitly or implicitly used in the pioneering papers where the spectrum of tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves )  @xcite and scalar ( adiabatic ) perturbations  @xcite generated from vacuum fluctuations was first correctly derived , was a kind of equivalence between the strongly squeezed vacuum fluctuations and classical perturbations with a stochastic gaussian amplitude and a fixed temporal phase in the heisenberg representation ( see  @xcite for a detailed discussion and explanation of this equivalence ) .",
    "the same applies to the schrdinger representation , see  @xcite where the quantum cosmological approach based on the wheeler - de witt equation was used , it reduces to the schrdinger representation for each mode after separation of variables and introduction of the quasi - classical time .",
    "finally , this equivalence can be seen as well using the wigner function formalism  @xcite .",
    "an essential property of this approach is that this type of transition from a quantum to a classical description of the perturbations , including the complete loss of quantum coherence , does not require any actual consideration of very small interactions between a given mode of perturbations and other degrees of freedom ( `` environment '' ) in the universe .",
    "though these interactions do of course exist and do lead to the transformation of an initial pure quantum state into a mixed state , their actual structure is unimportant for observable quantities as far as the exponentially small decaying mode of perturbations may be neglected ( note however that it must be taken into account if one wants to calculate the entropy of cosmological perturbations  @xcite ) .",
    "this is precisely why this transition was called `` decoherence without decoherence '' in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , though the quantum coherence disappears , not all coherence is lost : indeed , the equivalent classical stochastic perturbation remains partly correlated ( coherent ) at the classical level in the sense that it has a fixed temporal phase corresponding to the fact that it belongs to the special quasi - isotropic mode of perturbations .",
    "remarkably , this coherence has observable consequences : it results , in particular , in the appearance of multiple peaks ( called acoustic , or doppler peaks ) in the multipole power spectrum of @xmath17 with periodic spacing @xmath18 in the case of adiabatic perturbations . here",
    "@xmath19 is the sound velocity in the relativistic plasma consisting of coupled baryons and photons just before recombination , @xmath20 resp .",
    "@xmath21 are the conformal times today resp . at recombination . a similar effect ( though of significantly smaller amplitude ) takes place for cmb angular temperature fluctuations produced by primordial gravitational waves background  @xcite ( @xmath22 in this case ) .",
    "this approach however , especially that one based on the wigner function formalism , was strongly criticised in  @xcite on the ground that it might be applicable to vacuum initial conditions only and not to more general ones .",
    "hence , we adress in this paper the problem of the quantum to classical transition of quantum cosmological perturbations in the case of non - vacuum initial states . by an `` initial state '' of a given fourier mode @xmath23 of a quantum field we mean its state in the wkb regime deep inside the hubble radius at the inflationary stage , long before the hubble radius crossing , i.e. when @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) isotropic cosmological model , @xmath27 is the hubble parameter and the dot means a time derivative with respect to the cosmological time @xmath28 .",
    "of course , a non - vacuum initial state contradicts the whole spirit of the maximally symmetric initial state of the universe which lies at the heart of the inflationary scenario .",
    "thus , our `` wish '' would rather be to show that such an assumption is in conflict with observational data .",
    "surprisingly , as we will see below , this turns out to be more delicate .",
    "non - vacuum initial states are typically not self - consistent in the simplest variants of the inflationary scenario since they lead to a large energy density of inflaton field quanta which is not of the type of a cosmological term and it would contradict the assumption of inflation at time @xmath29 especially if we push @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "however , they could appear in more complicated , double inflationary models for perturbation modes which cross the hubble radius three or more times during inflation if we additionally assume ( without justification ) that these modes immediately decohere ( e.g. , in the particle number basis ) once they reenter inside the hubble radius . though the latter process is hardly physically viable , still it can not be completely excluded .",
    "furthermore , it is an important question of principle to study whether the possibility of a classical description of highly squeezed perturbations is generic or whether it is restricted to vacuum initial states only .",
    "particle creation from non - vacuum initial states was considered in many papers ; in the cosmological case - beginning with the pioneering paper by parker  @xcite , see the recent review  @xcite for many references . however , the primary quantities studied in these papers were the number of created particles and the average value of the energy - momentum tensor of a quantum field on a frw background .",
    "in contrast , we are mainly interested in the field fluctuations themselves since these are the quantities ( and not the number of particles ) that are directly observable in the case of cosmological perturbations .",
    "this refers both to scalar metric , or density , perturbations and to tensor metric perturbations or gravitational waves .",
    "naturally , the resulting quantum - to - classical equivalence that , as we argued in  @xcite , is the reason for the possibility of a classical description of the perturbations in the present universe takes place for these quantites , too .",
    "thus , the results of paper  @xcite are generalized to the case of non - vacuum initial conditions . in order not to introduce any preferred direction in space",
    ", we will consider only reflection symmetric @xmath31 quantum states .",
    "we show that a wide class of initial states become quasiclassical in the limit of high squeezing .",
    "this is shown in section 2 using the schrdinger representation , and in section 3 using the heisenberg representation . in section 4",
    "we derive conditions necessary for the semiclassical behaviour of quantum scalar ( adiabatic ) perturbations and gravitational waves on a frw background when expressed directly in terms of _ rms _ values of the perturbations . the wigner function approach to this problem",
    "is studied in section 5 .",
    "the specific , but important case of a thermal initial state is considered in section 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 contains conclusions and a discussion of a possible observational confirmation or rejection of a non - vacuum initial state .",
    "in this section , we are going to compute the wave function of different non - vacuum states in the schrdinger representation .",
    "let us first review the basics about the dynamics of the system that we consider here , namely that of a real massless scalar field on a flat frw universe . actually , the field can be massive and all the arguments presented here will go through .",
    "the space - time metric has the form @xmath32    let us remind how the dynamics of this system will lead to the appearance of squeezed states .",
    "we first write down the hamiltonian @xmath33 in terms of the field @xmath34 and the conformal time @xmath35 .",
    "the following result is then obtained @xmath36 where @xmath37 and a prime stands for derivation with respect to conformal time . here",
    "the following fourier transform convention is used : @xmath38 for functions as well as for operators . due to reality of the field @xmath39 , we have that @xmath40 , resp .",
    "@xmath41 for operators .",
    "therefore , any classical field configuration is completely specified by giving the fourier transforms in half fourier space .",
    "though generally this does nt have to be the case when the fields are quantized , we will deal here with states which are invariant under the reflection @xmath42 as mentioned above .",
    "the system can be described with the help of the complex valued field modes @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( we adopt a similar notation for all quantities ) , and momentum modes @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 , typically used in the heisenberg representation @xmath49 in terms of @xmath50 , the important quantities @xmath51 are given by the following expressions @xmath52 the functions @xmath53 satisfy the equation @xmath54 and @xmath55    the couple of functions @xmath56 represent only three independent real functions as they satisfy a wronskian constraint .",
    "the dynamics of the system can also be conveniently parametrized by the following three functions : the rotation angle @xmath57 , the squeeze angle @xmath58 and the squeeze parameter @xmath2 . when @xmath0 , the system is said to be highly squeezed . in that case",
    "also @xmath59 . as a result of the time evolution of our system",
    ", we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the unitary evolution operator from time @xmath29  to time @xmath62 .",
    "when working in the schrdinger ( complex ) coordinate representation , we will often adopt the following compact notation @xmath63 where @xmath64  and @xmath65  are considered as independent variables .    as a result of the coupling with the gravitational field , which plays here the role of an external classical field , the state @xmath66 which is the vacuum state of the field at",
    "some given initial time @xmath67 , will no longer be the vacuum at later times @xmath62 .",
    "indeed field quanta are produced in pairs with opposite momenta , we get a two - modes squeezed state .",
    "though the state at late time is no longer annihilated by the annihilation operators @xmath68 , it is still annihilated by the following time - dependent operator @xmath69 in the infinite volume case , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) translates into the following functional differential equation in the schrdinger ( complex ) coordinate representation @xmath70 therefore the state at late time is still gaussian , its wave functional in the infinite volume case ( the quantum variables are the functions @xmath71 of the continuous variable @xmath23 ) being given by @xmath72= { \\cal n}_k \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^3{\\bf k}~\\gamma_k~~ y({\\bf k},\\eta_0)~y(-{\\bf k},\\eta_0 ) \\right)~.\\ ] ]    for our purposes however , it is enough to consider our system enclosed in a finite volume and we then get as wave function of our system an ( infinite ) product of functions @xmath73 for each pair @xmath74 .",
    "the commutators and correlation functions of fourier transform operators are then c - number functions and not distributions .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath75 is through @xmath76 .",
    "we note the persisting symmetry under reflections in @xmath23-space , it is present in the initial state and the evolution does nt spoil it .    as a first generalization of the vacuum state at time @xmath29",
    ", we consider a two - modes coherent state @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath79 are the average values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 at time @xmath29 , and it satisfies also @xmath82 it is clear that the time - evolved state @xmath83 satisfies the following equations at any later time @xmath62 @xmath84 where @xmath85 are average values at time @xmath62 .",
    "it follows from ( [ cohinst],[coheq ] ) that @xmath86 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "( [ coheq ] ) are easily solved in the schrdinger representation resulting in the following wave function @xmath89 of the two - modes coherent state : @xmath90 we could equally well arrive at that result working in the real and imaginary coordinate representation .",
    "indeed , we can separate the variables @xmath39 and @xmath91 in real and imaginary part and consider the corresponding operators in the schrdinger representation . defining @xmath92 , the above equations can be written as : @xmath93 solving this differential system , we find that the wave function can be written as : @xmath94 , where : @xmath95 in complete accordance with ( [ psialpha],[psialpha1 ] ) .",
    "we are further interested in states which , at some initial time @xmath29 , contain some arbitrary number @xmath3 of particles with momenta @xmath96 and we denote these states by @xmath97 : @xmath98 we deal with modes initially deep inside the hubble radius ( @xmath99 ) and use the wkb solution for these modes .",
    "the time - evolved state defined in ( [ n ] ) becomes : @xmath100 with @xmath101 the action on @xmath102 of the operator inside the right parenthesis can be easily derived using the relation @xmath103 .",
    "indeed : @xmath104 we make further a binomial expansion of the first parenthesis : @xmath105 it is now convenient to use the following trick , namely to replace @xmath106  by the equivalent expression : @xmath107 as a result we get @xmath108 where we recognize the @xmath3th derivation of a product of functions .",
    "the leibnitz formula gives : @xmath109~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression inside the square brackets is just a laguerre polynomial as can be checked using rodrigue s formula : @xmath110 taking @xmath111 , where @xmath64  is constant , it follows that the expression inside the square brackets is just @xmath112 .",
    "the final result is therefore : @xmath113 this calculation can also be done differently , in a way which takes advantage of basic results pertaining to the familiar one - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "indeed , let us separate the complex variables and their corresponding operators in real and imaginary parts , as we did already previously .",
    "the definition of the state then becomes : @xmath114 in this representation , the differential equation ( [ deq ] ) becomes : @xmath115 knowing the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions , it is straightforward to find : @xmath116 it is now possible to show that this expression is equal to ( [ n1 ] ) . taking into account the relation between hermite and laguerre polynomials , we write : @xmath117 where 8.974.4 , p.1038 of  @xcite has been used in the last step of the above calculation .",
    "the two expressions ( [ n1],[n2 ] ) are two equivalent ways to write down the wave function in the coordinate schrdinger representation .",
    "they represent , together with ( [ psialpha ] ) , the basic result of this section .",
    "we note that the wave function ( [ n1 ] ) is a function of @xmath118 and therefore , like the vacuum wave function , it is invariant under reflection @xmath119 . as a result ,",
    "it is clear that all correlation with an odd number of points will vanish , the distribution has no skewness . on the other hand , it is of course no more a gaussian , a fact which will be important regarding the positivity of the wigner function .",
    "the transition to semi - classicality can now be seen in this representation .",
    "the condition for a semiclassical behaviour is that the phase of the wave function should be large for a typical value of @xmath120 .",
    "this results in the inequality @xmath121 ( here we restored @xmath13 for clarity ) .",
    "note that , as one could expect , the latter condition is more easily achieved for large @xmath3 .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath64 at time @xmath62 is given by : @xmath122 this probability distribution conserves probability along the classical trajectory @xmath123 when the condition @xmath124 is satisfied . as we shall show below in section 4 , the requirement that the latter condition should be better and better satisfied with the expansion of the universe picks up a small subset of all possible classical trajectories @xmath43 in phase space ( namely , the quasi - isotropic mode of perturbations )",
    "let us perform now an independent analysis of the transition to semiclassical behaviour in the heisenberg representation .",
    "the crucial point here is that , as shown in  @xcite , in the limit of infinite squeezing the mode functions @xmath43 can be made real by a time - independent phase rotation ( of course , in addition , @xmath125 )",
    ". then the momentum mode functions @xmath47 become purely imaginary . as a result",
    ", the field operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 take the following form : @xmath128 so , in the limit @xmath0 , the non - commutativity of @xmath126 and @xmath129 ( and of all other operators , too ) may be neglected . due to this reason , we can introduce equivalent classical stochastic quantities @xmath130 where @xmath131 are c - number complex stochastic time - independent variables obeying the same statistics as @xmath80 at the time @xmath29 .",
    "they have zero average and unit dispersion : @xmath132 , though they are generally not gaussian .",
    "the definition of the equivalence is the following : we say that a complex classical stochastic field @xmath133 with a corresponding momentum @xmath134 and a probability distribution in phase space @xmath135 are equivalent to quantum operators @xmath136 and @xmath137 if they give the same average values for an arbitrary function @xmath138 : @xmath139 ( here we omit @xmath5 for brevity but we restore hats over operators ) .    of course , such a condition can not be fulfilled generally , since quantum mechanics is not equivalent to classical field theory .",
    "however , in our case of infinite squeezing , due to relation ( [ trans ] ) between @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( while the same relation between classical stochastic quantities @xmath39 and @xmath91 holds ) , eq .",
    "( [ equiv ] ) reduces to a much simpler form : @xmath142 where @xmath143 ( since all operators are mutually commuting , we do not write any more hats over them ) . for the @xmath3-particles initial state ,",
    "the probability density function @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 so , in the limit of infinite squeezing and _ after _ use is made of relation ( [ trans ] ) the equivalence condition takes a form which is identical to the _ definition _ of an average value of an operator in quantum mechanics with the probability distribution @xmath146 equal to the modulus square of a wave function satisfying the schrdinger equation .",
    "thus , ( [ heis ] ) can be immediately proved by referring to the results of the previous section . however ,",
    "if we want to produce a completely independent derivation in the heisenberg representation , we should not use the fact that @xmath146 is determined by some solution of the schrdinger equation but instead we have to make an actual calculation of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ heis ] ) and prove their equality .",
    "further , we omit tilda over @xmath15 . we compute first the l.h.s . of ( [ heis ] ) : @xmath147 we use now the expression ( [ trans ] ) in the high squeezing limit when @xmath43 can be made real by a time - independent phase rotation , and write : @xmath148 we find after a somehow tedious but straightforward calculation : @xmath149 as for the r.h.s . of ( [ heis ] ) , we get : @xmath150 replacing @xmath151  by its explicit polynomial expression , we find : @xmath152 one finally checks , as we did numerically , that the sums in ( [ left ] ) and ( [ right ] ) are indeed equal : @xmath153 this ends the proof of equality ( [ heis ] ) .",
    "we note that the calculation done above yields in particular all the correlation functions . indeed ,",
    "if we set @xmath154 , we get : @xmath155 we see also that all the following correlation functions do vanish : @xmath156 having in mind the comparison of the probability density obtained here with a gaussian one , the two - point and four - point correlation functions are of particular importance : @xmath157 the above results can be directly used in order to calculate the kurtosis @xmath158 ( the irreducible 4-order moment ) of the probability distribution : @xmath159 it vanishes , as should be the case , when @xmath160 and tends to @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "we will come back to this point in section 6 and in the conclusion . for comparison , we present the corresponding results for a one - mode @xmath3-particles state for which @xmath163=1~.\\ ] ] an example of such a state is the @xmath164  mode",
    ". then @xmath165 these expressions will be also useful for the calculation of the curtosis of @xmath39 in the coordinate representation , see section 7 .",
    "let us now analyze in more detail the conditions imposed on the mode functions @xmath43 of the quantum field @xmath39 or on the equivalent stochastic functions @xmath166 by the requirement of high squeezing @xmath167  which is crucial for the quasi - classical equivalence as we have shown in sections 2 and 3 . in the long - wavelenght limit @xmath168 , the leading term in the mode functions @xmath43 and",

    "has the form : @xmath248 note also the second relation between @xmath249  and @xmath215 : @xmath250 and two useful identities for the background metric in this case : @xmath251    the corresponding leading long - wavelength behaviour of @xmath249  is : @xmath252 using ( [ a20 ] )  and ( [ a22 ] ) , it is easy to verify that the commutation relation ( [ a18 ] )  holds in this case too , which leads to ( [ a14 ] )   once more . though we derived the commutation relation ( [ a18 ] )  for two particular cases ( one scalar field or one ideal fluid ) , we believe that it has a much wider range of validity and we leave the proof of this assertion for another publication .",
    "the condition for semiclassical behaviour of the gravitational potential is : @xmath253 \\right|~.\\ ] ] substituting here the long - wave asymptote ( [ a12 ] ) and assuming hydrodynamical matter with a constant sound velocity ( that leads to the power - law behaviour @xmath254 with @xmath255 ) , we get the following condition of classicality similar to ( [ a6 ] ) : @xmath256 if the growing mode is dominating , then @xmath257 this condition is increasingly better satisfied with the expansion of the universe . in terms of the gravitational potential , this leads to @xmath258 on the other hand , for a purely decaying imaginary mode ( @xmath259 this condition weakens with the expansion of the universe .",
    "note that the conditions for the gravitational potential ( [ a28],[a29 ] ) are more restrictive than the corresponding conditions for gravitational waves ( [ a9],[a11 ] ) since the right - hand sides of the former conditions are in @xmath260 times larger ( however , the growing mode is always semiclassical in the long - wavelength regime for the most interesting case of perturbations produced during inflation with the initial conditions ( [ a19 ] ) ) . as pointed above",
    ", this peculiar feature may be a result of @xmath210 not being the best quantity to study quantum - to - classical transition .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the condition for a perturbation to become more and more classical at later times ( i.e. with the expansion of the universe ) chooses a subclass of all solutions for perturbations , namely , the quasi - isotropic modes .",
    "we will return to this point at the end of the paper .",
    "the wigner function was proposed as a candidate for the probability density function of a quantum mechanical system in phase space . according to the rules of quantum mechanics such a probability density",
    "can not exist , so one can only hope to come as close as possible to it by requiring from good candidates , like the wigner function , to fulfill some basic properties of the probability density , but not all of them . in particular , the wigner function is real , but not definite positive",
    ". let us calculate the wigner function for the system under consideration : @xmath261 we will use the simplified notations @xmath262 and the same convention for @xmath263 the quantity @xmath264 , is canonically conjugate to @xmath265 , and so @xmath266 .    we consider first the wigner function @xmath267 of the coherent initial state @xmath268 .",
    "actually , it is clear from ( [ psialpha ] ) that it will be similar to the wigner function @xmath269 of the vacuum @xmath270 . the following result is obtained @xmath271 we recognize the vacuum wigner function @xmath272 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the wigner function @xmath273 of @xmath3-particles states .",
    "our method will be to compute the generating functional of @xmath273 .",
    "for this purpose we first write down the generating functional of @xmath274 : @xmath275 the generating functional of the laguerre polynomials is given by : @xmath276 we insert the expression for the vacuum wave function into ( [ gencoh ] ) , replace each sum of laguerre polynomials by the generating function ( [ genlag ] ) and rearrange terms in the exponentials .",
    "the integration reduces to fourier transforms of gaussians . in order to give a compact result",
    ", we will set : @xmath277    the result of the integration can then be written in the following way : @xmath278 we have calculated the finite form of the series @xmath279 , but what we really want in order to get @xmath273  is the finite form of the series @xmath280 .",
    "this means that we must select terms of equal order in @xmath281  and @xmath282 in the double sum and replace the product @xmath283  by @xmath284 .",
    "looking at the last expression ( [ finform ] ) , we see that the terms that must be kept are those with @xmath285  in the two sums",
    ". we can perform the transformation and write the relevant generating functional : @xmath286}^{1/2}}{1-u}\\right)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath287 is the bessel function .",
    "it is now possible to identify the generating functional of a product of laguerre polynomials by using the identity ( eq .",
    "8.976.1 in  @xcite ) : @xmath288 if we take : @xmath289 we can finally write ( [ gfw ] ) as : @xmath290 this gives the final result : @xmath291 transition to semiclassical behaviour can be analyzed using this result .",
    "we see from the last expression that the wigner function , again in the limit of infinite squeezing @xmath0 , will be delta - concentrated around classical trajectories of the system .",
    "indeed , @xmath269 , the wigner function corresponding to the initial vacuum satisfies  @xcite @xmath292 and , therefore , also @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the @xmath295-distribution .",
    "thus , we obtain one more independent derivation of the relation ( [ trans ] ) between @xmath39 and @xmath91 in the limit @xmath0 which results in the reduction of ( [ equiv ] ) to ( [ heis ] ) .",
    "an interesting point is that , in contrast to the vacuum initial state where the wigner function is positive definite , here the wigner function is no longer positive definite _ before _ the limiting transition @xmath0 leading to ( [ phdist ] ) is performed .",
    "thus , @xmath296 can not be interpreted as a probability distribution in classical phase space for any finite @xmath297 .",
    "this property actually constitutes the core of the criticism of the wigner function approach in the papers @xcite .",
    "however , we do not want to insist on this classical interpretation of the wigner function before the limiting transition ( why should we ? ) , and we use the wigner function only to show that , for high squeezing , it becomes concentrated near a bunch of classical trajectories in phase space with initial stochastic amplitude @xmath298 obeying the probability density function ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "for this reason , too , we deliberately use the word `` concentrated '' instead of `` peaked '' because the latter term , though often used may create a wrong impression about the positivity of the fine structure of the wigner function around these classical trajectories . on the other hand , _ after _ the limiting transition @xmath0 the wigner function acquires the structure ( [ phdist ] ) which _ may _ be used as a classical probability distribution in phase space . moreover ,",
    "this probability distribution is sufficient for all problems where oscillating quantum fine structure ( `` wave pattern '' ) around classical trajectories can be neglected .",
    "this discussion also sheds some new light on the question as to what extent any coarse graining is necessary to obtain the transition to semiclassical behaviour of quantum cosmological perturbations .",
    "a coarse graining becomes really necessary if one intends to obtain some classical probability distribution in phase space from the wigner function before the limiting transition @xmath0 .",
    "however , for quantities for which the above mentioned quantum fine structure is unimportant ( and all quantities observable in forseeable future belong to this class ) all parameters resulting from the correct ( i.e. physically justified ) coarse graining disappear after the transition @xmath0 , so we are allowed to forget about coarse graining at all . as a result , for these quantities , decoherence ( understood as a partial loss of quantum coherence , with the remaining part of coherence being expressable in classical terms )",
    "is reached without consideration of any actual mechanism of coarse graining and decoherence ( that is why we call it `` decoherence without decoherence '' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there do exist quantities and problems for which this fine structure is important ( e.g. , it is essential for the calculation of the entropy of cosmological perturbations ) .",
    "but then one should not introduce a coarse graining simply by hand or average over some degrees of freedom of the universe arbitrarily called as `` unobservable '' .",
    "all such choices have to be justified by consideration of real physical processes .",
    "the very specific case of a coherent initial state , for which the wigner function is given by eq . ( [ coh ] ) , is still instructive since it clearly shows a smooth transition between deterministic and purely stochastic behaviour of perturbations in the semiclassical limit .",
    "indeed , if @xmath299 , we get an effective deterministic classical behaviour ( a time - dependent bose condensate of the field @xmath39 ) .",
    "realization of this inequality at all times is possible , e.g. , by choosing initial conditions @xmath300 and @xmath301 proportional to @xmath302 and @xmath303 resp . with a large coefficient of proportionality . in the opposite limit @xmath304 characteristic for real cosmological perturbations , the average value of perturbations is negligible with respect to their _ rms _ value .",
    "then quantum perturbations become equivalent ( in the sense defined above ) to classical quantities with a stochastic amplitude , a fixed phase defined by the @xmath295 multipliers in the expression for the wigner function ( [ coh ] ) , and a practically zero average value .",
    "of course , generally both average and _ rms _ values may be non - zero .",
    "we see that the appearance of deterministic quantities in the semiclassical limit is a very specific phenomenon restricted to a narrow class of both special initial states and special time evolution ( with not too many `` particles''created ) . in particular , even the choice of a coherent initial state which is already classical and deterministic at the initial moment @xmath29 does not guarantee that it remains so at later times .",
    "a constructive counterexample is provided by the case where the initial conditions @xmath300 and @xmath301 correspond to the pure decaying mode in the long - wavelenghth regime @xmath305 . on the contrary ,",
    "transition to effective stochastic classical behaviour is a generic effect which arises as a result of high squeezing of a very wide class of initial quantum states .",
    "until now we have considered n - particles initial states .",
    "let us now consider the important case of a thermal initial state .",
    "such a state arises for example in the cosmological scenario where the stage of `` thermal inflation '' @xcite takes place after relaxation of the radiation - dominated universe to the state of thermal equilibrium if we mean by @xmath29 the moment when this stage of late inflation begins . in this case",
    ", the probability density in the @xmath71-representation is given by :    @xmath306    where @xmath307 is the ratio of the temperature to the energy field quanta for given @xmath5 and @xmath308 is a normalization constant .",
    "so , actually @xmath307 depends on @xmath309 but we drop the @xmath309 for brevity of notation .",
    "the probability to find @xmath3 quanta in the initial state drops rapidly for @xmath310 .",
    "this probability density can be calculated using the generating functionnal of squared laguerre polynomials , already given in ( [ gensqrlag ] ) : @xmath311    when @xmath312 , _ i.e. _  the temperature is much smaller than the energy of the quanta for given @xmath5 , we see that @xmath313 is almost gaussian , since the exponential dominates the bessel function .",
    "this is of course to be expected since then our thermal state almost reduces to the vacuum state , there are practically no thermal excitations .",
    "what can be said if @xmath307 grows , from what temperature on will we get a noticeable departure from a gaussian probability density ?",
    "it turns out that for any value of @xmath307 , the probability @xmath313 is a symmetric single - peaked function centered around zero , at first sight quite similar to a gaussian .",
    "therefore , the relevant discriminating parameter to be calculated in order to study the gaussianity of this distribution is the kurtosis .",
    "fortunately , the latter can be found analytically . since @xmath313  depends only on @xmath314 ,",
    "its even momenta are given by the following integrals :    @xmath315    four different integrals of the bessel functions are given in  @xcite , 6.621.1 , with the results expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath316 . using the third one",
    ", we check the normalisation @xmath317 . with the second one ,",
    "we calculate @xmath318  and @xmath319 , and finally the kurtosis @xmath158 :    @xmath320    looking at fig.[kurtosis ] , we see that there is a sharp transition between a low - temperature gaussian behaviour ( @xmath321 ) and a high - temperature non - gaussian behaviour ( @xmath322 ) .",
    "intermediate values of the kurtosis imply that @xmath307 is close to one , within only one order of magnitude .",
    "fig.[probability ] shows how the gaussian transforms into another distribution at high temperature .",
    "scales of cosmological interest were inside , most of them even deep inside , the hubble radius at the onset of inflation .",
    "their energy is therefore much higher than the temperature at that time .",
    "this corresponds to values of @xmath323 for which , as can be seen from  ( [ kurt ] ) and from fig.[probability ] , the probability looks very much like a gaussian .",
    "we have shown here that , for a wide class of initial non - vacuum states including all @xmath3-particles , thermal and most of the coherent states , quantum inhomogeneous cosmological perturbations ( both adiabatic perturbations and gravitational waves ) generically acquire semiclassical behaviour in the regime when their wavelenghth is much larger than the hubble radius . in the language of quantum field theory , the latter regime corresponds to the high squeezing limit @xmath0 .",
    "then an equivalent classical description of these perturbations in terms of c - number stochastic quantities becomes possible .",
    "this , according to our paradigm , constitutes the transition from quantum to effectively classical behaviour of cosmological perturbations .",
    "thus , we generalize the results of  @xcite obtained for the perturbations of the vacuum initial state .",
    "the main difference between vacuum and non - vacuum initial conditions is that the statistics of the stochastic amplitude of the equivalent classical field modes is gaussian in the former case but generally non - gaussian in the latter case .",
    "we proved this equivalence in three different independent ways .",
    "first , we explicitly constructed the wave function in the schrdinger representation thereby exhibiting its wkb shape .",
    "then , we have shown that the operators in the heisenberg representation correspond to classical stochastic functions in that limit .",
    "finally , we have computed the wigner function and shown that it becomes concentrated along classical trajectories .",
    "since we do not in general choose a unique vacuum state from an infinite number of unitary non - equivalent vacuum states at the initial moment @xmath29 ( the case of the inflationary scenario where a unique choice is possible was used as an illustration only ) , our results are valid for @xmath3-particles , thermal and coherent states constructed using any possible vacuum state . from a mathematical point of view , this ambiguity is reflected in the freedom to choose the constant parameters @xmath170 and @xmath173 characterizing the long - wavelength regime ( [ a1 ] ) which satisfy only one normalization condition ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the generalization from vacuum to non - vacuum initial conditions does not produce any new problem of principle for the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "the only thing which is important for it is that the classicality conditions for perturbations derived in section 4 should be satisfied ( in particular , it is enough to have a sufficienly large amplitude of the quasi - isotropic mode of perturbations in the long - wavelength regime ) .",
    "the wigner function for @xmath3-particles or thermal initial states ( but not for coherent initial states ) is not positive definite for a finite @xmath2 .",
    "however , we have shown that this does not prevent the transition to the semiclassical behaviour in the limit @xmath324 expressed by eq .",
    "( [ phdist ] ) .",
    "we believe that this addresses the criticism against the transition to the semiclassical behaviour raised in  @xcite since the generalization of our considerations to the case where the scale factor @xmath180 is itself quantized but still in the wkb regime does not bring new principally different features .",
    "note also that we never use the so called `` semiclassical gravity '' , or one - loop approximation , @xmath325 to study the evolution of quantum perturbations and the quantum - to - classical transition for them ( these equations are usually understood as equations for the average value @xmath326 of the metric tensor ) .",
    "this approximation is inappropriate for the problem under consideration , not only because one - loop approximation is not exact when only a few quantum fields are important , but mainly due to the fact that these equations are grossly insufficient in the typical case arising in cosmology where average values of perturbations @xmath327 are negligible ( or even exactly zero ) as compared to their _ rms _ values , and all their higher moments should be calculated ( see also the discussion at the end of section 5 ) .",
    "so , one should go beyond the one - loop , or the gaussian , approximation .",
    "now we discuss the question whether this non - gaussianity of perturbaions which appears in the case of non - vacuum initial states is observable , and if it can be used to exclude such states using observational data on @xmath328 angular fluctuations of the cmb temperature .",
    "first , one should take into account that observable quantities in physical space are real and consist of sums of quantities of the type ( @xmath329 ) , irrespective of the fact whether @xmath39 is an operator or a c - number stochastic quantity . as a result ,",
    "the statistics of quantities in real space is the same as for one - mode states .",
    "in particular , in the gaussian case the probability distribution is the one - dimensional gaussian distribution , not the two - dimensional one that prevails for the complex amplitude @xmath330 .",
    "then the value of the curtosis @xmath158 for quantities in real space in the case of an @xmath3-particles initial state is given by the expression ( [ onemode])(e.g .",
    ", @xmath209 can be taken as @xmath331 itself ) .",
    "previously , the skewness @xmath332 and topological characteristics , like the genus , of the cmb temperature fluctuations were mainly considered .",
    "however , @xmath333 for all @xmath3-particles initial states .",
    "so , we propose to measure the kurtosis @xmath158 since this is more interesting .",
    "for non - vacuum states which we considered , @xmath158 is negative .    for a non - gaussian distribution",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath158 lies below the cosmic variance level of purely gaussian perturbations for all initial non - vacuuum states where different @xmath5 modes are @xmath295-correlated and _ rms _ values of perturbations depend on @xmath334 only .",
    "this results due to the averaging over angular directions which is equivalent to summing over all @xmath5 modes with the same @xmath334 .",
    "such a sum will rapidly become gaussian due to the central limit theorem .",
    "in particular , the curtosis of the sum of @xmath335 equally distributed modes with kurtosis @xmath158 is equal to @xmath336 while the cosmic variance limit for the gaussian distribution @xmath337 .",
    "still , the non - zero kurtosis can be observable for less symmetric and more correlated initial states .",
    "an extreme example is when @xmath338 can take only 2 values @xmath339 with equal probability .",
    "then the kurtosis @xmath340 and it certainly lies above the cosmic variance level . on the other hand",
    ", this discussion shows that there is a wide class of initial non - vacuum states which can not be distinguished from the vacuum initial state by looking at the statistics of observational quantities , so it is not easy to disprove them .",
    "finally , we have shown the crucial role played by the quasi - isotropic mode of perturbations in the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "namely , if this mode is present then , as time goes on and the universe expands , perturbations become more and more semiclassical . on the contrary",
    ", this does not take place for the decaying mode .",
    "note that there is no quasi - isotropic mode in the case of the exactly homogeneous and isotropic frw model ( even fully quantized ) or of the cosmological model of the bianchi i type .",
    "there are known problems with the quantum - to - classical transtion in frw quantum cosmology ( even for large values of the scale factor ) summarized in paper  @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss here to what extent these problems are really dangerous for the frw cosmology , but we would like to point out that the results of our paper suggest that the final solution to these problems will require consideration of more general , inhomogeneous cosmological models which contain the quasi - isotropic mode of perturbations ( or its generalization to the fully non - linear case ) . also , it is tempting to connect the arrow of time in the universe with the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "then a possible relation between the arrow of time and the growth of inhomogeneities in the universe ( the transition from order to chaos ) emerges .",
