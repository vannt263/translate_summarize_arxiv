    "shape is a very basic property of a galaxy , yet it contains strong constraints for its formation history , with different merger , accretion and assembly scenarios resulting in different shapes .",
    "still , intrinsic shapes of individual galaxies are not readily obtained : detailed photometry and kinematical information is needed to construct a dynamical model of a galaxy , and constrain its shape ( e.g. statler 1994 ; statler , lambright & bak 2001 ; van den bosch & van de ven 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , many studies to obtain intrinsic shapes of galaxies have focused on large samples , using statistical methods to obtain the underlying intrinsic shape _ distribution _ of a particular galaxy population ( e.g. , hubble 1926 ; sandage , freeman & stokes 1970 ; lambas , maddox & loveday 1992 ; tremblay & merrit 1996 ; ryden 2004 ; vincent & ryden 2005 ; ryden 2006 ; kimm & yi 2007 ; padilla & strauss 2008 ; mndez - abreu et al . 2010",
    "; yuma , ohta & yabe 2012 ) .",
    "these studies rely on measurements of the observed ellipticities @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the observed axis ratio of the galaxy image , and , in principle , do not require kinematic information ( although as we mention later inclusion of kinematic misalignment provides additional constraints on the shape distribution , e.g. binney 1985 ; franx , illingworth & de zeeuw 1991 ) .",
    "especially the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has been a major provider for imaging used in shape studies : recent results based on this survey include the non - circularity of discs in spiral galaxies ( ryden 2004 ; padilla & strauss 2008 ) and the presence of triaxial and prolate galaxies in the early - type galaxy population ( vincent & ryden 2005 ; kimm & yi 2007 ) .",
    "the selection of the galaxy populations in these previous studies has been predominantly based on morphology , colour and structural parameters such as srsic index ( srsic 1968 ) . with the advent of integral - field spectroscopic studies we have an additional parameter to base our sample selection on : kinematic structure . in this paper",
    "we exploit this opportunity to make a stricter selection by using the atlas@xmath0  sample : a volume - limited survey of 260 nearby early - type galaxies ( cappellari et al .",
    "2011a , hereafter paper i ) , that includes integral - field spectroscopy obtained by the sauron spectrograph ( bacon et al .",
    "we are now able to make a distinction between two classes of early - type galaxies , fast and slow rotators , based on their extended kinematic properties , and as such obtain a cleaner galaxy population sample .",
    "in section 2 we describe the properties of the atlas@xmath0  sample and the dataset that we use for the shape inversion in this paper , while in section 3 we explain our methods and show our results for an axisymmetric shape inversion .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion and interpretation of our results , and we further investigate the assumption of axisymmetry , by including kinematic misalignment angles in our shape analysis .",
    "we summarize our work in section 5 , and provide additional formularium for our shape distributions in the appendices .",
    "the atlas@xmath0  sample was selected from a volume - limited parent sample of 871 galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "this parent sample consists of all galaxies within a distance of 42 mpc , down to a total luminosity of -21.5 @xmath7 , based on the 2mass extended source catalog ( jarrett et al .",
    "the sample had to be observable with the william herschel telescope ( wht ) from la palma , spain , so that only galaxies with sky declination @xmath8 were included .",
    "finally , the dusty region near the galaxy equatorial plane @xmath9was excluded , with @xmath10 the galactic latitude . from this parent sample , early - type galaxies were morphologically selected based on visual inspection of multi - colour images from sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) or @xmath11-band dss2-blue images , resulting in a sample of 260 galaxies .",
    "the main selection criteria here were the apparent lack of spiral arms in face - on , and dust lanes in edge - on systems , indicating that our selected galaxies are indeed early - types . for more details on the selection and properties of the atlas@xmath0  sample ,",
    "we refer the reader to paper i. important for our work here is to keep in mind that our sample is complete and has integral - field kinematics available for all galaxies ( paper i ; krajnovi et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter paper ii ; emsellem et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter paper iii ) , allowing us to perform a shape inversion on fast and slow rotators separately .      for a statistical shape analysis",
    "as described in this paper to work , we must have a galaxy sample that is randomly oriented on the sky , such that our assumption of random viewing angles is a valid one .",
    "our selection criteria for removing late - type galaxies from our sample ( i.e. , presence of spiral arms and/or dust lanes ) may however differ in reliability for different viewing angles and could in principle introduce a bias in our sample .",
    "for instance , if our method of detecting dust lanes in edge - on galaxies is not effective enough to identify all edge - on late - type galaxies present , then our sample would be contaminated with an extra population of flat spirals .",
    "we also note that although edge - on galaxies with large scale dust lanes were excluded from the atlas@xmath0sample , galaxies with small , central dust features were not , as these are not related to galaxy - wide spiral arms . to investigate whether a bias is present , we extract band w4 22@xmath12 m from the archive of the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) for 231 galaxies in our sample .",
    "these fluxes are presented in davis et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and are measured within elliptical apertures , see the on - line wise documentation for more details .",
    "if indeed our sample suffers from harbouring edge - on spiral galaxies , which are dustier than early - type galaxies , then we expect the ratio between the dust - tracing mid - infrared and the star - tracing optical fluxes to change as a function of ellipticity .",
    "figure  [ fig : randomangles ] shows that this is not the case : there is no correlation between mid - infrared to optical flux ratio and ellipticity for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "this is confirmed by the linear pearson correlation coefficient @xmath13 , which is small ( -0.062 ) .",
    "the mid - infrared fluxes correlate with the optical fluxes as expected ( temi et al .",
    "2009 , davis et al .",
    "2014 ) , which is a necessary condition for our test to work .",
    "we therefore conclude that the atlas@xmath0sample of early - type galaxies is indeed randomly distributed on the sphere of viewing angles .",
    "the ellipticities of the galaxies in our sample were measured and presented in paper ii , and we refer the reader there for details . briefly , for 212 galaxies in our sample sdss dr7 @xmath14-band imaging is available ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) and for 46 galaxies not covered by this survey we obtained comparable @xmath14-band imaging with the wide field camera on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) on la palma .",
    "these observations and their data reduction are presented in scott et al .",
    "( 2013 , paper xxi ) . for the two remaining galaxies we used 2mass k - band observations instead .",
    "since we are interested in the global shapes of the galaxies , and to avoid our analysis being dominated by e.g. central bars , we measured the ellipticities using the moment of inertia of the surface brightness distribution on the sky subtracted images , with bright stars and neighbouring galaxies masked ( see paper ii for a detailed description of this method ) .",
    "this way , all components in the galaxy contribute to a global ellipticity measurement , which would not be the case if we measured ellipticity only at a fixed radius .",
    "however , this method of measuring ellipticity does introduce a bias towards the shapes at larger radius .",
    "only pixels above a certain threshold , 3 times the rms of the sky , were included in the measurements . for galaxies that were dominated by bars",
    ", we lowered the threshold to 0.5 or 1 times the sky rms , to better probe the underlying stellar disc .",
    "this resulted in ellipticity measurements representative of the galaxy out to typically 2.5 to 3 effective radii .",
    "we compared these global ellipticity values to radial profiles , determined by fitting ellipses along isophotes with kinemetry ( krajnovi et al .",
    "2006 ) , and found that these values agree well : the standard deviation of the differences between the two measurements was 0.03 , see paper ii .",
    "uncertainties were determined by repeating the ellipticity measurements for each galaxy at different thresholds ( 0.5 , 1 , 3 and 6 times the sky rms ) and the standard deviations of these measurements were adopted as errors .",
    "we show the resulting observed ellipticity distribution for our sample in figure  [ fig : hist_eps ] , both for the fast and slow rotators .",
    "the 1-@xmath15 errors in the histograms have been determined using monte carlo simulations , based on the errors in ellipticity of the individual galaxies .",
    "these individual values can be found in table 1 of paper ii .",
    "c +    paper ii also provides values for the photometric and kinematic position angles , used to measure the kinematic misalignment @xmath16 between the projected rotation axis and the minor axis of a galaxy .",
    "the photometric position angle was measured on the sdss , int or 2mass imaging , using the same method as described above for the ellipticity .",
    "the kinematic position angle was measured on the sauron velocity maps using the method outlined in appendix c of krajnovi et al .",
    "both these position angles , as well as the kinematic misalignment are tabulated in table 1 of paper ii , and we show the histogram of observed kinematic misalignments for fast and slow rotators in figure  [ fig : hist_eps ] .",
    "the majority of the fast rotators have small kinematic misalignments , with 76 per cent having misalignments smaller than 5@xmath17 .",
    "the slow rotators on the other hand show more kinematic misalignment , with less than half of them ( 44 per cent ) having @xmath18 .",
    "fast and slow rotators are two distinct classes of early - type galaxies , as was shown by emsellem et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and cappellari et al .",
    "they defined slow rotators to have a specific angular momentum @xmath19 , while fast rotators in their classification have @xmath20 . later , this classification was refined in paper iii , considering the regularity of the velocity maps ( paper ii ) . in the resulting classification",
    ", the separation between slow and fast rotators takes the projected ellipticity of the systems into account , with slow rotators having @xmath21 , and fast rotators @xmath22 .",
    "figure 6 in paper iii illustrates that this new division of the early - type galaxy population into fast and slow rotators nicely follows the kinematic classification based on the velocity maps .",
    "this figure also shows that @xmath23 is a more reliable separator between fast and slow rotators than the @xmath24 quantity , with @xmath25 the velocity amplitude , and @xmath26 the velocity dispersion measured within one @xmath27 .",
    "we refer to paper iii for more details on this classification scheme .",
    "important for our analysis is that the separation of our sample in slow and fast rotators does not introduce any biases in viewing directions : this is discussed in paper iii ( see their sections 5.1 and 5.2 ) , but also shown in simulations performed independently by jesseit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and bois et al .",
    "( 2011 , paper vi ) .",
    "in particular , jesseit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) perform an extensive study of variations in @xmath23 with inclination , and find that @xmath23 does not deviate significantly from its maximum value for a large range of viewing angles .",
    "this makes @xmath23 a reliable and robust estimator of the intrinsic angular momentum .",
    "jesseit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) quote a confusion probabiliy of 4.6 per cent of mistakingly classifying a fast rotating galaxy as a slow rotator .",
    "they add that this probability will be even lower in practise , as their simulated merger sample has a significantly larger number of prolate shaped galaxies than observed in galaxy surveys , and most of the wrongly classified galaxies in their sample fall into this category . in our atlas@xmath0sample",
    "we only have two clear examples of prolate galaxies : one of them is classified as a fast rotator , but both have non - regular rotation ( paper ii ) .",
    "we therefore are confident that any contaminations in our sample due to misclassification of fast and slow rotators is negligible for our intended purposes .    based on papers ii and iii fast rotators are galaxies with regular , aligned velocity fields that often possess discs and bars , while slow rotators",
    "are often kinematically misaligned , have kinematically distinct cores ( kdcs ) and are located on the more massive end of the luminosity function . in addition , cappellari et al .",
    "( 2011b , hereafter paper vii ) show that slow rotators are predominantly found in the high - density environment , which for our sample is the core of the virgo cluster , and are almost non - existent in the field .",
    "these all are hints that fast and slow rotators have different formation scenarios ( see also paper vi ) .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that these two classes of objects have a similar shape distribution , and indeed a simple kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms at the 5 per cent significance level that the ellipticity distributions of the fast and slow rotators in our sample are not drawn from the same underlying distribution ( @xmath28 , see also figure  [ fig : hist_eps ] ) .",
    "a mann - whitney u - test also rejects the notion that the two ellipticity distributions have the same mean ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we therefore consider the fast and slow rotators separately , when inverting their shape distributions .",
    "as explained below , we assume an axisymmetric underlying shape distribution in this section , and we will explore deviations from this axisymmetric assumption later on in this paper in   [ sec : triax ] ."
