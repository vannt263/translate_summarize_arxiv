    "the physics of graphene monolayers continues to attract a lot of attention and to provide a rich source of interesting phenomena.@xcite by studying the effects of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in a graphene layer , where symmetry allows for an `` intrinsic '' ( @xmath0 ) and a `` rashba '' ( @xmath1 ) term in the soi , kane and mele@xcite made a remarkable discovery that sparked the exciting field of topological insulators:@xcite for @xmath2 , there is a bulk gap with topologically protected edge states near the boundary of the sample .",
    "this is similar to the quantum hall ( qh ) effect but happens in a time - reversal invariant system .",
    "the resulting `` quantum spin hall '' ( qsh ) edge states form a one - dimensional ( 1d ) helical liquid , where right- and left - movers have opposite spin polarization and spin - independent impurity backscattering is strongly suppressed .",
    "the qsh state has been observed in hgte quantum wells,@xcite but several works@xcite showed that @xmath0 is probably too small to allow for the experimental verification of this novel phase of matter in pristine graphene .",
    "consequently , other material classes have been employed to demonstrate that topologically insulating behavior is indeed possible.@xcite however , graphene experiments@xcite have also demonstrated that the rashba coupling @xmath1 can be increased significantly by depositing graphene on ni surfaces .",
    "moreover , very recent theoretical predictions@xcite suggest that already moderate indium or thallium adatom deposition will dramatically enhance @xmath0 by several orders of magnitude . by using suitable adatoms ,",
    "it is expected that in the near future both soi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be varied over a wide range in experimentally accessible setups .    in view of these developments , in this paper",
    "we study the electronic properties of a graphene monolayer with artificially enhanced soi . besides the soi",
    ", we include piecewise constant electrostatic potentials , orbital and zeeman magnetic fields , and strain - induced vector potentials .",
    "the latter cause pseudo - magnetic fields but do not violate time reversal invariance ; for a review , see ref .  .",
    "while the interplay of the rashba term @xmath1 with ( pseudo-)magnetic fields in graphene has been studied in several theory works before,@xcite the intrinsic soi @xmath0 did not receive much attention so far .",
    "however , the transmission properties of graphene s dirac - weyl ( dw ) quasiparticles through barriers with arbitrary soi have been studied recently@xcite in the absence of ( pseudo-)magnetic fields .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we formulate the model and construct the general solution for piecewise constant fields . on top of the orbital magnetic field , we allow for arbitrary soi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , zeeman energy @xmath3 , and we also take into account aspects of strain - induced fields .",
    "the homogeneous case is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we determine the landau level states for this problem in closed and explicit form .",
    "in particular , the fate of the zero modes residing at the dirac point ( energy @xmath4 ) will be discussed in the presence of the soi .",
    "our results also apply to the case of a strain - induced homogeneous pseudo - magnetic field.@xcite next , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we study edge states near the boundary of a semi - infinite sample for vanishing rashba coupling , @xmath5 . for weak magnetic fields , one then expects to have helical ( spin - filtered ) qsh edge states .",
    "interestingly , at the dirac point , upon increasing the magnetic field , we find that a quantum phase transition takes place between the qsh phase and a second qsh - like phase with spin - filtered edge states , considered previously by abanin _",
    "et al._,@xcite where the spin current direction is reversed .",
    "this spin current reversal should allow for an experimental detection of this quantum phase transition , on top of the obvious consequences for qh quantization rules.@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we turn to a mesoscopic waveguide geometry , where a suitable inhomogeneous magnetic field ( or exchange field produced by lithographically deposited ferromagnetic films ) defines the waveguide.@xcite we show that the soi parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 give rise to interesting spin texture of the resulting propagating chiral states in such a waveguide . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "unless many - body effects are of crucial importance , the low - energy electronic properties of a graphene monolayer are well captured by two copies of a dw hamiltonian supplemented with various terms describing soi , ( pseudo-)magnetic fields , and electrostatic potentials.@xcite the wavefunction corresponds to a spinor comprising eight components , @xmath6 the pauli matrices @xmath7 below act in sublattice space corresponding to the two carbon atoms ( @xmath8 ) in the basis of the honeycomb lattice , while pauli matrices @xmath9 act in physical spin ( @xmath10 ) space .",
    "finally , the valley degree of freedom ( @xmath11 ) corresponds to the two @xmath12 points@xcite and pauli matrices @xmath13 refer to that space .",
    "specifically , we here consider models where the mentioned extra terms in the hamiltonian are piecewise constant along the @xmath14-direction and homogeneous along the @xmath15-axis . consequently , the momentum @xmath16 is conserved , and we have an effectively 1d problem in terms of the four - spinors @xmath17 . the orbital magnetic field @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) is expressed in terms of the vector potential @xmath21 , where we choose the gauge @xmath22 inclusion of the constant @xmath23 is necessary when connecting regions with different magnetic fields in order to make @xmath24 continuous . assuming that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the graphene sheet , the zeeman field couples to @xmath25 and determines the coupling constant @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the land factor and @xmath28 denotes the bohr magneton .",

    "the coupling @xmath1 also captures curvature effects.@xcite a constant electrostatic potential , @xmath35 , has been included in eq .  .",
    "strain - induced forces@xcite lead to a renormalization of @xmath35 as well as to the appearance of an effective vector potential , @xmath36 expressed in terms of the in - plane strain tensor @xmath37 , see ref .",
