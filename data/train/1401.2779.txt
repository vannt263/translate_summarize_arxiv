    "one of the first and largest detectors at ino will be a magnetized iron calorimeter ( ical ) detector to primarily study atmospheric muon neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) .",

    "muons produced in the charged - current ( cc ) interactions of atmospheric muon ( anti-)neutrinos with the iron target can be easily detected in ical .",

    "the magnetic field allows the charge identification as well .",
    "the main difficulty in reconstructing the energy and direction of the incident neutrino arises from the uncertainty in energy and direction of the associated hadrons , mainly pions produced in interactions at neutrino energies of @xmath0 1  gev . only hit multiplicity in the rpc layers and its distribution are available in the study of hadron response of ical @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hits are restricted to a few layers only in contrast to the long track of the minimum ionising muons .",
    "a potentially crucial factor in the determination of hadron energy and direction resolution is the thickness of the absorber material , i.e. , iron .",
    "this must be optimised taking into account the physics goals of the experiment , apart from the detector size , geometry , stability and cost . in this simulation study",
    ", the effect of the variation in plate thickness on hadron energy resolution is analysed using fixed energy single pions .",
    "earlier , such studies have concentrated on very high energy hadrons from tens of gev to hundreds of gev in hadron calorimeters @xcite .",
    "these studies have indicated a square root dependence on the thickness @xmath1 of the hadron energy resolution on the absorber thickness . but no corresponding systematic analysis of the absorber thickness dependence at lower energies , in the gev region , is found in the literature , although the values of the hadron energy resolution at some fixed thicknesses are available . naively , hadrons traversing the plates at an angle @xmath2 will  encounter \" , in principle , an effective plate thickness @xmath3 so that the thickness dependence can be explored through this angle dependence . however , in the actual detector , the detector geometry including support structures , and orientation as well as the arrangement of the detector elements introduce additional nontrivial dependence on thickness",
    "this is what this work intends to understand .",
    "the main focus of this report is to present the results of a simulation study of the thickness dependence of hadron energy resolution in the energy range 215 gev .",
    "this energy domain is of primary importance to neutrino oscillations studies with ical . the default design of ical at present uses iron plates of thickness 5.6 cm .",
    "the energy resolution of hadrons ( both for fixed energy single pions as well as for multiple hadrons from cc interactions of neutrinos with iron ) propagating in the default configuration of the ical detector has been discussed in ref .",

    "are kept unchanged while changing the plate thickness . in order to maintain the approximate weight of the detector for each plate thickness ,",
    "the number of iron plates ( and hence the number of rpc layers ) are adjusted accordingly .",
    "this does not affect the analysis since the few gev hadrons which this study focuses on traverse only a few layers and rarely reach the detector edges .",
    "pions , which constitute the major fraction of hadrons produced in neutrino interactions in the detector mainly propagate as showers .",
    "the hits in the shower are denoted as @xmath7-hits or @xmath8-hits depending on whether the information originated from the @xmath7- or the @xmath8-pickup strip .",
    "the maximum of these two numbers in a layer , named as orig - hits , is chosen for the study .",
    "as shown in our previous work @xcite , the analysis is not sensitive to this choice .",

    "this ensures that the event is completely contained inside the detector .",
    "the direction of propagation is determined by their zenith angle @xmath2 and the azimuthal angle @xmath11 in this geometry which is oriented such that the @xmath7-axis ( the coordinate system is defined earlier ) corresponds to @xmath12 and the @xmath9-axis corresponds to the vertically up direction , with @xmath13 . unless otherwise specified ,",

    "if @xmath62 = 1 , then the detector is said to be compensating .",
    "the variation of the @xmath62 ratio with incident energy for the two sample thicknesses 2.5 cm and 5.6 cm are shown in fig  [ e - by - h ] .",
    "it can be seen that the value of @xmath62 decreases with energy .",
    "however , it should be noted that there is no direct measurement of the energy deposited in ical . here",
    "the energy of a shower is simply _ calibrated _ to the number of hits , and electrons which travel smaller distances in a high z material like iron have lower number of hits compared to charged pions . at lower energies",
    "the electron shower hits are concentrated around a small region . at these energies",
    ", the charged pions also do not traverse many layers in the detector due to the larger hadronic interaction length .",
    "this causes the mean of the electron hit distribution to be roughly the same or slightly larger than that of the @xmath10 hit distribution . but with the increase in energy , the charged pions travel more distance and hence give more hits ( as they traverse more layers ) since the hadronic interaction length is much more than the electromagnetic interaction length at higher energies and hence the ratio of hits in the two cases drops with energy .",
    "the layer cut only affects the low energy result by marginally decreasing the @xmath62 ratio at @xmath95 gev , that too only for higher thicknesses .    in a neutrino interaction where",
    "all types of hadrons can be produced ( although the dominant hadrons in the jet are pions ) , the response of ical to hadrons produced in the interaction depends on the relative fractions of charged and neutral pions . the nuance neutrino generator was used to generate charged current atmospheric muon neutrino events for the default ical thickness of 5.6 cm .",
    "the fraction of the different types of hadrons obtained from a 100 year sample was found to be @xmath96 , with the remaining 3% contribution mainly from kaons .",
    "the average response of hadrons obtained from the charged current muon neutrino interaction can be expressed as : @xmath97 , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber           & = & h \\left[(1-f_0 ) + f_0 \\times \\frac{e}{h } \\right ] ,   \\label{eqn - e - by - pi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the electron response , @xmath99 the charged hadron response and @xmath100 is the neutral pion fraction in the sample .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino events of interest in ical are dominated by low energy events with hadrons typically having energies @xmath101 gev for which the average value of @xmath62 is @xmath102 . using @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn - e - by - pi ] ) , we get the average hadron response for nuance - generated events to be @xmath104 which is not very different from @xmath99 . for this reason ,",
    "the analysis of response with multiple hadrons in nuance - generated events sample was not very different from that of the single pions sample , as discussed in ref .",
