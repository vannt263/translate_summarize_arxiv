    "the study of exactly solvable models is a very important field in condensed matter physics , which began with bethe s solution of the isotropic heisenberg chain @xcite . in general , the bethe ansatz ( ba ) solution of a model has several drawbacks : it has a complex mathematical structure ; the excitations are not immediately available ; and most important , it does not give explicit results even for the thermodynamic quantities of the system .",
    "it was only when yang and yang @xcite presented a strategy to study the thermodynamics of ba solvable systems that the temperature dependence of quantities such as the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility become available .",
    "the method is now designated as thermodynamic bethe ansatz and has known many developments in the last thirty years @xcite .",
    "additionally , correlation functions , such as the conductivity , can not be obtained from the ba equations alone , and combination of ba results with other methods is required for their calculation @xcite .",
    "the ba ansatz method has been applied to bose , fermi @xcite , and spin systems @xcite .",
    "it is a general feature of the ba solution , first proved by yang and yang@xcite for the bose case , that a given eigenstate of the model is characterized by a unique set of quantum numbers @xmath0 .",
    "further , it also can be shown that all configurations of these quantum numbers @xmath1 exhaust the hilbert space of a given model . since the energy eigenvalues are functions of the above quantum numbers , instead of using tba and quantum monte carlo approaches , we can study ba solvable models in quantum number space by classical monte carlo .",
    "furthermore , for a small system ( but for larger systems than those available to exact diagonalization methods ) , it is possible to solve the ba equations for all eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the expectation value of an hermitian operator in thermal equilibrium can be computed .    in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce two numerical approaches for computing thermodynamic quantities of bethe ansatz solvable models .",
    "the methods are ilustrated with the 1d isotropic heisenberg model , since this model is well studied in the literature . furthermore",
    ", the study of the heisenberg model is it self relevant , since this system predicts many properties of quasi - one - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "this model has been investigated by many kinds of methods .",
    "for example , the low temperature behaviors are quite well understood by a combination of bethe ansatz @xcite and conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "a strong logarithm singularity in the susceptibility at low temperature was first found by the bethe ansatz calculation of quantum transfer matrix @xcite and then verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model has been studied by tba @xcite as well as by qtm @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mcba_sec : iso ] , we first briefly review the ba solution of the isotropic heisenberg model . in sec .",
    "[ mcba_sec : nba ] and sec .",
    "[ mcba_sec : mcba ] , we introduce the basic idea of numerical bethe ansatz ( mba ) and monte carlo bethe ansatz ( mcba ) . in sec.[mcba_sec : spce ] we check the effectiveness of these two methods computing the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility in the absence of an external magnetic field and compare our results with those obtained from the tba .",
    "we than use our methods to study the two quantities above in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ mcba_sec : summary ] .",
    "now let us first review the bethe ansatz solution of the 1d heisenberg chain , which can be found in the book of takahashi @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isotropic heisenberg model is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of sites , @xmath4 are spin @xmath5 operators at site @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent anti - ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases , respectively .",
    "the solution with periodic boundary condition @xmath8 using the string hypothesis takes the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 , and    @xmath11    and @xmath12 is the real part of the n - string which is designated by @xmath13 @xmath14 is the quantum number of @xmath15th n - string ( note that @xmath16 and @xmath15 are indices ) .",
    "we denote the number of the n - string by @xmath17 , thus @xmath18 and the string configuration @xmath19 satisfy @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of down spins .",
    "the quantum number of n - string @xmath22 is an integer ( half - odd integer ) if @xmath23 is odd ( even ) and satisfy @xmath24 where @xmath25 . for a given set of @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ mcba_eq : bae ] ) can be solved numerically and the energy is given by @xmath27 which represents the energy of the lowest weight state in su(2 ) irreducible space designated by @xmath28 .",
    "in the presence of an external field @xmath29 a zeeman term is added to eq .",
    "( [ energ ] ) .",
    "hence the total energy of a given quantum number configuration is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetization of the state",
    "in statistical mechanics , the expectation value of an hermitian operator @xmath32 in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is known as partition function , defined as @xmath35 @xmath36 is inverse temperature , and @xmath37 represents sum over all possible eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that the variation of @xmath34 with respect to temperature or any other external parameters affecting the system can virtually tell us everything we might want to know about the macroscopic behavior of the system . for example , the internal energy is given by @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ mcba_eq : partitionfunction ] ) , it is easy to see that the internal energy can also be written in terms of a derivative of the partition function : @xmath39 the specific heat is given by the derivative of the internal energy : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the boltzmann constant which is set to unit hereafter .    our aim is to combine the idea of statistical mechanics mentioned above with the numerical solution of the ba equations .",
    "the main idea of the numerical bethe ansatz method we introduce here is , first , to compute all eigenvalues of a ba solvable model from its corresponding ba equations .",
    "then to compute the expectation value of the hermitian operators , representing the physical observables we are interested in , by averaging those operators over all states of the system , weighting each state with its own boltzmann weight .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the hilbert space of the isotropic heisenberg model is complete under the string classification .",
    "here we want to show how to travel through all @xmath42 states in quantum number space and illustrate it by considering a system of 6 sites .    for the case of @xmath21 down spins ,",
    "the first task is how to obtain all string configurations fulfilling the restriction ( [ mcba_eq : stringcondition ] ) .",
    "we adopt a time - like number  @xmath43 \" , where the magnitude @xmath17 measures from 0 to @xmath44 $ ] ( here @xmath45 $ ] returns the truncated integer value of @xmath46 ) , just like hour and minute in  hh : mm \" measure from 0 to 23 and 0 to 59 respectively .",
    "if we increase the number  @xmath47 \" by adding 1 to the first digit @xmath48 step by step , we can travel through all possible values .",
    "among all these numerical values , only those whose digits satisfy the condition ( [ mcba_eq : stringcondition ] ) are what we need",
    ". then all string configurations can be found by this procedure .",
    "of course , these operations are realized in a computer . in order to make the method clear ,",
    "let us consider a problem of 6 sites .",
    "* m=0 : * it is easy to have the state with all spins up , i. e. @xmath49 , which has energy @xmath50 .    * m=1 : * in this case , we only have one string configuration @xmath51 and one quantum number @xmath52 , thus there are 5 states .",
    "each of them is represented by one quantum number in the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "we can get all possible quantum number configurations from the following figure , @xmath54 where the dot is the occupied quantum number , and the open circles represent other possible quantum numbers .",
    "then the ba equation is just @xmath55 which has a simple solution @xmath56 .",
    "* m=2 : * here the string configuration is characterized by @xmath57 .",
    "we construct a number  @xmath58 \" , in which the maximum value of @xmath48 is 2 ( @xmath59=2 $ ] ) , and @xmath60 1 ( @xmath61=1 $ ] ) . increasing @xmath48 step by step we generate all possible configurations of the  @xmath62 \" number , ranging from 0:0 to 1:2 . among all the generated configurations , we are only interested in those satisfying the condition @xmath63 .",
    "the first case is @xmath64 , in which the quantum number satisfy @xmath65 , the second one is @xmath66 , in which the number satisfy @xmath67 .",
    "they can be characterized by @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , where @xmath70 denotes the occupation for a quantum number of 2-string . in table",
    "[ mcba_tab : m2qnf ] , we list all quantum number configurations for @xmath71 .",
    "the ba equations for these two cases are @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    ".all quantum number configurations for @xmath71 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]             we apply nba to 24-site system and mcba to 60-site system , respectively .",
    "the later has @xmath74 different quantum number configurations , hence it is impossible to calculate all the eigenvalues of the system .    in figs .",
    "[ mcba_figure_cv24 ] and [ mcba_figure_sus24 ] , we show the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility , for a 24-site system , obtained from nba and compare our results with those obtained from tba .",
    "it is clear that the two results match . in fig [ mcba_figure_mcba ]",
    ", we show the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility , for a 60-site system obtained from mcba together with the results from tba .",
    "they both agree to each other except at low temperature . in table",
    "[ mcba_table2 ] , we compare , for the ferromagnetic case , the two methods we introduced here with tba , giving the explicit numerical values .",
    "it is clear that our methods work very well for the present model .",
    "hence our conclusion is that for small systems , such as @xmath75 , and for the heisenberg chain , it is possible to compute all eigenvalues and to obtain all possible thermodynamic quantities of interest by using eq .",
    "( [ mcba_eq : expectationq ] ) . for temperatures larger than the finite size energy gap",
    "our results agree with tba results exactly .",
    "for larger systems , however , results can still be obtained by using the mcba method .",
    "now we study the thermodynamics of the model in the presence of a magnetic field by nba , which has also been studied by klmper @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : acvh ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : asuh ] , the results for the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility of the anti - ferromagnetic case are shown for various magnetic fields .",
    "it is clear from these two figures that there are two different behaviors at low temperature , separated by the saturation field @xmath76 at the ground state . in order to understand",
    "better this behavior of the antiferromagnetic case , let us use the mapping between the heisenberg model and the spinless fermion model .",
    "this mapping is achieved by the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , and hamiltonian ( [ mcba_eq : hamitonian ] ) can be written as @xmath77 where the spinless fermion operators @xmath78 obey the usual anti - commutation relation , @xmath79 is the usual local number operator . when @xmath80 , the system is not fully polarized , that is @xmath81 , hence we always have two fermi points @xmath82 at the ground state . the dispersion relation of low - lying excitations is dominated by the linear-@xmath83 dependence",
    ", hence we still have the fermi - liquid like specific heat : @xmath84 at low temperatures . if @xmath85 , however , and from the point view of spinless fermions , we have @xmath86 , and the dispersion relation becomes @xmath87 , because of the @xmath88 dispersion - relation for the fermions in the lattice .",
    "hence , the specific heat manifest a @xmath89 behavior at sufficiently low temperature for @xmath90 , which can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : acvh ] ( open circles ) .",
    "moreover , the magnetic susceptibility presents a strong peak for @xmath90 , when @xmath91 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : asuh ] , panel ( c ) ] .",
    "this strong magnetic response is associated with a change in the nature of the elementary excitations when the line @xmath90 is crossed at zero temperature .",
    "indeed , at @xmath92 and @xmath76 , the system manifest infinite susceptibility , as can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig : asuh ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "we attribute it due to the degeneracy between the state of @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 $ ] , and a small magnetic field can fully polarize the system . the phase with @xmath95 share anti - ferromagnetic - like behavior [ fig . [",
    "fig : feffo ] , panel ( b ) ] , while for @xmath80 , the susceptibility shows a logarithm singularity @xcite .    for the ferromagnetic case the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility",
    "are ploted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feffo ] , for different values of the magnetic field .",
    "as is known , if @xmath96 the ground state of the ferromagnetic case is highly degenerate with @xmath97 and a very small @xmath29 can fully polarized the system .",
    "so it is easy to understand why zero temperature susceptibility is infinite . after it is magnetized ( in the presence of small @xmath29 ) , however , the susceptibility should be zero .",
    "this behavior is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : feffo ] , panel ( b ) .",
    "we also show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : feffo ] , panel ( c ) , the susceptibility obtained by mcba .",
    "both the results of the two methods agree with each other perfectly .",
    "in summary , we presented two numerical approaches to discuss the thermodynamics of bethe ansatz solvable models .",
    "the first one is the numerical bethe ansatz which works very well for a small system .",
    "we think it is possible to obtain all eigenvalues of a system up to size @xmath98 , for the heisenberg model . for a relatively larger system",
    ", we also find that the monte carlo simulation in quasi - momentum space works well in the moderate and high temperature regions . at low temperatures",
    "the present selection method is not excellent , and a better one is required .",
    "the discovery of such a method is a challenging and interesting research problem .",
    "there are many physical quantities of interest at finite temperature which are still not well understood , such as spin stiffness of xxz model , important to understand the transport properties , because of the complex form of the thermodynamic equations .",
    "our methods provide a new route to compute all these quantities directly from the bethe ansatz equations .",
