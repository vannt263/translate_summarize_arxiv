    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) offers unique possibilities to control optical properties of medium with light @xcite . since its first experimental observation in strontium vapors",
    "@xcite , it has been thoroughly investigated in different material systems including quantum dots @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , nanoplasmonics @xcite , metamaterials @xcite , and optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "many applications of eit , ranging from reversible mapping of light - matter states in quantum memory @xcite to all - optical switching of one beam by another @xcite and cross - coupling nonlinearities at the few - photon level @xcite , reveal its ability as a basic tool for implementation of quantum information processing . however , to date , only classical fields are employed in usual eit schemes to yield transparency in probe light absorption , while , despite the fundamental importance , the transparency induced in atomic ensembles by quantum fields has not been explored yet , except for the cavity - based eit , where the classical control beam is replaced by a cavity vacuum field @xcite . the remarkable feature of quantum eit - systems is their capability to generate quantum nonlinearities at the low - light level . here",
    "we analyze the eit created in an ensemble of @xmath0type atoms by most `` classical '' quantum states that are multi - mode coherent states , and reveal the deviation of quantum dynamics from the classical one .",
    "we show that for the same intensity of the control field the transparency observed in the case of a single - mode coherent state perfectly coincides with the classical - field induced transparency , while the transparency substantially decreases as the number of the modes increases . as a result , the probe field changes from slow light based on the eit to superluminal propagation caused by the absorption .",
    "this behavior results from the modification of the photon statistics in the coherent state , where the increase of mode number shifts the maximum of photon distribution to the fock states with small number of photons provided that the total intensity of the control field remains unchanged . to enhance the atom - photon interaction and cancel the doppler broadening",
    ", we consider propagation of a weak probe pulse in a cold atomic ensemble , such as the atoms inside a hollow - core photonic crystal fiber ( hc - pcf ) of a few microns in diameter , which can tightly confine both atoms and photons transversely over long interaction lengths @xcite .",
    "of course , different dissipative effects are significant for coherent states with different mode numbers , however , we ignore these complications to concentrate on more fundamental issues .    in the next section , we formulate the quantum theory of eit in @xmath0type atoms and give a formal analytical solution for the probe field operators . in sec.iii",
    ", we apply this solution to the case of quantum control field in multi - mode coherent - states . here",
    "we demonstrate how the medium transparency and dispersion are drastically altered by changing the number of the modes .",

    "we consider the configuration of transversely trapped atoms inside the hc - pcf , which has been experimentally realized in @xcite .",

    "we consider a weak coherent state @xmath112 , which can be experimentally obtained by controlled attenuation of a small portion of the laser emission @xcite .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "2 that in the quantum regime the transparency of the medium reduces , as the number of coherent modes increases .",
    "this immediately follows also from eq .",
    ", where the function @xmath90 and the exponential factor tend to unity for @xmath113 , while for the transparency one needs @xmath114 as seen from eqs .. for large @xmath115 this strongly weakens the interaction of the control field with atoms , so that the maximum transparency is expected in the case of single - mode coherent state or cw control field , when the transparency in fact perfectly coincides with that induced by the classical control field ( fig.2a , red line ) . to understand the origin of this behavior , let us recall that each mode @xmath76 of the input coherent state of the control field is itself a coherent superposition of many fock components including the vacuum state .",
    "from the structure of the fock - state dependence in eq .",
    "we recognize that the total contribution to the eit coming from all the modes with a given number of photons @xmath116 is determined by the term @xmath117 in the denominator of the right hand side of the first equation of indicating that the greater transparency is expected for larger @xmath116 .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath118 and large @xmath115 , the transparency is induced mainly by the lower fock states with small number of photons @xmath119 , because the probability distribution of fock - states in @xmath96 is defined by the @xmath116-th degree of the mean photon number per mode @xmath120 , which quickly decreases with increasing @xmath116 . moreover , the probe field experiences huge absorption , when the control field is in the vacuum state @xmath121 . as a result ,",
    "the eit peak decreases as @xmath115 increases by the law shown in fig.3 .",
    "thus , the observed effect is due to modification of photon statistics in the coherent state , where the increase of mode number @xmath115 , while keeping the intensity @xmath118 of the control field unchanged , shifts the maximum of photon distribution to the fock states with smaller number of control photons @xmath119 .",
    "obviously , this stringent quantum behavior emerges for small values of @xmath118 and disappears in the classical limit @xmath122 .",
    "in the last case , the perfect eit is displayed in fig.2b for @xmath101 and @xmath100 , where atom - photon coupling @xmath123 is taken small enough to remain below the autler - townes regime .",
    "for the parameters as in the fig.2 normalized to that of @xmath124.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        .",
    "the parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "2.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    much physical insight into mechanisms that depress the effect of the control field is available from the probe field dispersion @xmath125 presented in fig.4 in units of @xmath126 .",
    "it is seen that the normal dispersion is switched into anomalous dispersion ( green curve ) via increasing the mode number , so the probe field can change from slow light based on the eit to superluminal propagation caused by the absorption . to understand this effect we analyzed the average group velocity of the probe pulse defined as @xmath127 with the group index @xmath128 calculating analogously to @xmath129 in eqs .",
    ", we get @xmath130 showing that when the control field is in the vacuum state @xmath121 , the probe group index is negative , which , however , for the moderate values of @xmath115 is entirely compensated by the contribution of occupied fock states with @xmath131 . yet ,",
    "at larger values of @xmath115 the compensation is not complete and , therefore , when the mode number increases from one , the probe group velocity first increases from @xmath132 and then upon passing the infinite value @xmath133 becomes negative .",
    "fig.5 shows the change of probe velocity from sub- to superluminal propagation , which for our parameters occurs approximately at @xmath134 .",
    "finally , we discuss the connection between the classical and quantum descriptions of the eit represented by eqs . and , respectively . in the first case ,",
    "the probe absorption depends on the rabi frequency or electric - field amplitude of the control beam and , hence , on the total number of control photons . on the contrary , in the quantum regime",
    ", the perfect eit is induced by several control photons in the interaction region .",
    "it is clear , however , that the latter occurs only if the few - photon level in the interaction region is supported for a long time until the probe pulse propagates through the medium . in the traveling - wave geometry , this can be achieved by a constant flow of control photons from outside . for flying coherent - state , the photon flux into interaction volume",
    "is readily calculated to be @xmath135 , from which the total number of control photons is obtained as @xmath136 . for our parameters including @xmath137 one finds @xmath138 , which is comparable with that of a classical control field used in the experiment in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , in the considered configuration , to induce the same transparency in both classical and quantum cases almost the same amount of control photons is required .",
    "however , it is possible to implement the quantum regime of the eit on the basis of the presented theory without using the multiphoton control pulse , if the medium is placed inside an optical ring cavity and a quantum control field containing just a few photons is used as the circulating intracavity field provided that the cavity decay time is larger as compared to the probe transmission time through the medium .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the eit system is a promising platform to study the quantum properties of multi - mode coherent states , which to our knowledge , have never been explored in previous studies .",
    "our main conclusion is that the quantum nature of these states is manifested , when the number of the modes exceeds the mean number of control photons in the medium .",
    "otherwise , the classical result is reproduced . in the cold - atom based eit scheme considered here ,",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the peculiar behavior of the absorption and group velocity of the probe pulse .",
    "an important result of our study is the general solution for the probe pulse propagation in the quantum regime of the eit obtained for arbitrary input quantum state of the control field .",
    "the use of interaction between the single - photon probe pulse and quantum control fields opens possibilities to study the spatiotemporal structure and quantum statistics of propagating multiphoton states , which is a challenging task currently . in our scheme",
    "the control field not only induces transparency for the quantum probe pulse , but simultaneously imparts on the latter a phase shift at the level of few photons via the kerr - type nonlinear interaction between the two fields .",
    "this is fundamentally different from most studies of cross - phase shifts of quantum light , which are based on @xmath51-type eit medium @xcite , where the kerr interaction between the signal and probe fields is mediated by a strong classical field .",
    "the measurement of the phase shift induced by the control field on the single - photon probe pulse provides nondestructive detection of the number of control photons , thus enabling the quantum nondemolition measurement of the photon number @xcite in the control beam . for these measurements ,",
    "the scheme of optical ring cavity is more preferable .",
    "the conditional phase shifts can be also used as quantum phase gates for quantum logic operations @xcite given that there are large susceptibilities in the control channel to retain the weak - field approximation .",
    "future work will explore these issues for new multiphoton states ( see , for instance , @xcite ) of the control field , which are needed for modern quantum information experiments .",
    "this research has been conducted in the scope of the international associated laboratory ( cnrs - france and scs armenia ) irmas .",
