    "the fact that the feedback reduction rule has the direct form of a schur complement , that is equation ( [ eq : e_fb ] ) , is however an unexpected feature . we might mention that the schur complement has previously emerged as the appropriate tool in adiabatic elimination results in the slh formalism @xcite .    in the paper",
    ", we have restricted our attention to just the proof of the mathematical form of the feedback reduced stratonovich matrix .",
    "this is done at the very broad level of generality offered by the slh formalism , and have deferred the application to specific models for a latter publication .",
    "it should be mentioned that situations such as completely closed feedback loops served as a motivating problem for this publication as the schur complement form already appears in a restricted sense , and strongly suggestive of the general result presented here in theorem 1 .",
    "we have also restricted to the vacuum case for the input fields .",
    "the issue of introducing time delays into the feedback connections has also been ignored - we assume the validity of an instantaneous feedback limit - however we note that there has been some promising developments in this direction for linear quantum systems @xcite .    while the stratonovich form of the feedback reduction rule is much simpler that the it form ( [ eq : slh_feedback ] ) , it is not true that it is universally easier to work with .",
    "for instance , the series product formula is a corollary to the concatenation rule ( [ eq : slh_parallel ] ) and the feedback rule ( [ eq : slh_feedback ] ) , and so must be derivable from the two equivalent formulations in terms of stratonovich matrices of coefficients .",
    "however this derivation is very involved .",
    "it is therefore the case that certain operations , such as putting systems in series are better handled with the it , or slh , form while other operations , such as feedback reduction may be better handled in the stratonovich form .",
    "the situation is not unlike classical circuit theory where one chooses judicially the form of the immittances : namely impedances for components is series in a network , and admittances ( their inverses ) for components placed in parallel in a network .",
    "while analogy is not exact , it does suggest that a hybrid use of the it and stratonovich rules may be very useful for calculating the slh characteristics of complex quantum feedback networks .",
