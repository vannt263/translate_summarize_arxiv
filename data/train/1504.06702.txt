    "the magnetic moment is an important characteristic of elementary particles , but the magnetic moments of many particles ( e.g. , charm and beauty baryons ) are , as yet , not measured .",
    "this is because for particles with a short lifetime @xmath0 ( @xmath1s for @xmath2 and @xmath3s for @xmath4 ) , the decay length @xmath5 cm if the energy acquired through the production reaction equals 1 tev @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the anomalous magnetic moments of short - lived particles can not be measured with conventional methods .",
    "the existence of the spin rotation phenomenon for high - energy particles moving in bent crystals in the channeling regime was first established in @xcite .",
    "the spin rotation angle is determined by the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath6 and , according to @xcite , can attain values as high as many radians .",
    "the unique feature of the effect is that for lorentz - factors @xmath7 , the value of the limit spin rotation angle per unit length of 1 cm in a crystal with a limit radius of curvature @xmath8 at which the particle still moves in the channeling regime without being expelled from the channel by the centrifugal force is independent of particle energy .",
    "the idea advanced in @xcite was experimentally verified and confirmed for @xmath9 hyperons in fermilab @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the experiment @xcite given in @xcite suggests the feasibility of using the spin rotation effect in bent crystals to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of short - lived charm baryons @xmath2 and @xmath4 . in @xcite , a thorough consideration",
    "was given to charm baryons @xmath2 produced by a beam of protons whose momentum in a tungsten target was @xmath10gev / s .",
    "the characteristic momentum of the produced @xmath2 was @xmath11 gev / s ( characteristic lorentz factor @xmath12 ) . at the same time , it was stated in @xcite that since the beauty quark has a negative charge , the beauty baryons have a negative charge , too , and can not be channeled .",
    "as a result , the spin rotation phenomena for them does not exists .",
    "positively - charged antiparticles could be channeled , but the production rates at lhc energies would be too small . it is noteworthy here that with growing particle energy the dechanneling length is increased not only for positively - charged particles , but also for their negatively charged counterparts .",
    "what is more , successful experiments recently demonstrated the possibility to deflect negatively - charged particles at gev energies @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in light of the projected increase in energy at lhc and fcc , it seems pertinent to return to the issue of using the spin rotation effect in bent crystals for measuring the magnetic moment of not only positively- but also negatively - charged particles .",
    "the effect of spin depolarization of high - energy particles scattered by crystal axes ( planes ) provides another possibility of measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of short - lived , high - energy particles @xcite .",
    "what is more , an important advantage of the spin depolarization effect is that it applies to both positively- and negatively - charged particles .",
    "thus , this effect enables magnetic moment measurements of not only positively - charged baryons , but also beauty baryons , whose negative charge and rapid dechanneling make such measurements quite a challenge even in the range of high energies .",
    "this paper considers the effects of particle spin rotation and spin depolarization in crystals at lhc and fcc energies .",
    "it is shown that these effects can be used for measuring anomalous magnetic moments of short - lived particles in this range of energies .",
    "it is also demonstrated that the effect of spin depolarization of high - energy particles scattered by crystal axes ( planes ) can be used effectively for measuring the anomalous magnetic moments of negatively - charged beauty baryons , too .",
    "because the depolarization effect is possible at wider angles as compared with the angles of capture into channeling regime ( determined by the lindhard angle ) , the number of usable events in this case appears to be greater than in the experiments with bent crystals , thus giving us hope for measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of beauty baryons .    before proceeding to the consideration of the possibility to use the phenomena of spin rotation and depolarization of high - energy particles moving in bent or straight crystals for measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of charm and beauty baryons ,",
    "let us recall briefly the theory underlying these phenomena , as it is stated in @xcite .",
    "in 1976 , e. tsyganov @xcite demonstrated that high - energy particles may move in the channeling regime in a bent crystal , thus moving along the curved path and deviating from the initial direction . in 1979 ,",
    "the predicted effect was experimentally verified in jinr ( dubna , russia ) @xcite : the proton beam with the kinetic energy of 8.4gev was rotated through the angle of 26mrad by means of the silicon crystal of length 2.0 cm . at present , the experiments on channeling in bent crystals are performed at the world s largest accelerators . in these experiments a great variety of crystal optical elements are widely used to manipulate the beams of high - energy particles .",
    "the next step forward was made in 1979 by v. baryshevsky , who demonstrated @xcite that the spin of a particle moving in a bent crystal rotates with respect to the momentum direction figure ( [ fig16.1 ] ) .",
    "= 6 cm    indeed , in a bent crystal a particle moves along a curved path under the action of the electric field @xmath13 induced by the crystallographic plane . in the instantaneous rest frame of the particle , due to relativistic effects , this field produces a magnetic field @xmath14 , which acts on the particle magnetic moment , thus causing spin rotation in this field ( figure [ fig16.1 ] ) .    owing to an extremely large magnitude of the field @xmath15 cgse and , as a result , a large magnitude of the field @xmath16 gauss , the spin rotation angle in the crystal of several centimeters in length can reach several radians .",
    "now , let us proceed to a more detailed consideration of the effect of particle spin rotation in a bent crystal .    from the bargmann - michel - telegdi ( bmt )",
    "equation @xcite follows that as the energy of particles increases , their spin precession frequency in the external magnetic field changes , being determined in the ultrarelativistic case by the anomalous magnetic moment . as a result , for example",
    ", in a magnetic field @xmath17gs , the electron ( proton ) spin precession frequency @xmath18s@xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the anomalous part of the magnetic moment ) , and the spin rotation angle per one centimeter path length @xmath21 is just @xmath22 as mentioned above , a relativistic particle in a bent crystal `` senses '' a much greater magnetic field . as the particle energy is increased (",
    "particle wavelength is decreased ) , the quasi - classical character of particle motion enables one to apply the laws of motion determined by classical mechanics .",
    "if a crystal is nonmagnetic , the bmt equation for the spin polarization vector @xmath23 can be written in the form @xcite @xmath24\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the electric field at the point of particle location and @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the particle velocity ) .",
    "let us recall here that vector @xmath27 characterizes the polarization of a particle in its `` instantaneous '' rest frame .",
    "intracrystalline fields @xmath13 are large , reaching the values of @xmath28 cgse and even greater .",
    "therefore from ( [ chan_25.1 ] ) follows that for constant intracrystalline fields , the spin precession frequency could reach @xmath29s@xmath19 and the angle @xmath30 could be of the order of @xmath31rad / cm .",
    "however , when a particle moves through a crystal in arbitrary direction , the field @xmath13 , in a similar manner as in the amorphous medium , takes on random values at the particle location point . as a consequence ,",
    "such a field causes spin depolarization .    under channeling conditions",
    ", the situation is basically different .",
    "if the crystal bending radius is @xmath32 , then , for example , a beam of high  energy protons will change its direction following the crystal bend @xcite , i.e. , the particle will move along a curved path .",
    "the stated motion is due to a constant mean electric field acting on a particle in a bent crystal",
    ".    equation ( [ chan_25.1 ] ) for a particle moving in a crystal , for example , in a planar channel bent to a radius of curvature @xmath32 around the @xmath33-axis , has a form ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 the trajectory lies in the @xmath36 , @xmath37 plane ) @xmath38 the position vector @xmath39 of a particle in such a channel rotates about the @xmath33-axis with the frequency @xmath40 .",
    "its magnitude oscillates about the particle equilibrium position @xmath41 in the channel with the frequency @xmath42 , the amplitude @xmath43 , and the initial phase @xmath44 . in the explicit form @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we point out that , due to the presence of centrifugal forces in a bent crystal , the equilibrium point @xmath41 does not coincide with the position @xmath32 of the minimum of the electrostatic potential @xmath48 of the channel . for example , for a particle moving in a harmonic well @xmath49 where the constant @xmath50 is determined by the crystal properties .",
    "integration of ( [ chan_25.2 ] ) in the polar coordinate system gives ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 for a harmonic well we can write ( [ chan_25.3 ] ) accurate up to the terms of the order @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the form @xmath56+\\arctan\\frac{\\zeta_{x}(0)}{\\zeta_{z}(0)}\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the electric field at the location point of the particle center of equilibrium in the bent crystal ; @xmath59    the coefficient @xmath60 in ( [ chan_25.4 ] ) is small ( for si , the coefficient @xmath61ev/@xmath62 , @xmath63s@xmath19 for protons with the energy @xmath64gev , as a result , @xmath65 ) . neglecting the term containing @xmath60",
    ", we obtain that the spin rotates with frequency @xmath66 ( with growing energy @xmath67 , the coefficient @xmath68 increases , and the spin rotation turns into oscillations at frequency @xmath66 and the frequencies multiple of @xmath42 ) . due to a large magnitude of the field",
    "@xmath69 curving the particle trajectory ( @xmath70 cgse ) , the frequency @xmath71s@xmath19 , and the rotation angle @xmath72rad / cm .    if the radius of curvature @xmath73 ( a straight channel ) , then only spin oscillations due to the term containing @xmath60 remain . in this case , a significant spin rotation occurs only at high energies : for @xmath74tev protons , for example , @xmath75 .",
    "thus , according to ( [ chan_25.1 ] ) , the spin precession frequency of a particle moving in a bent crystal is @xmath76    as stated above , this expression for the frequency follows immediately if we consider what field acts on the spin in the particle s instantaneous rest frame . as a result of relativistic transformations ,",
    "the electric field that is transverse relative to the particle velocity in the particle rest frame generates a magnetic field @xmath77 that is orthogonal to @xmath78 and has a magnitude equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the spin precession frequency associated with the anomalous magnetic moment in the particle rest frame is @xmath80    the spin precession frequency in the laboratory frame is @xmath81    it is noteworthy that with zero particle s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath6 , the particle spin precession frequency would equal the orbital rotation frequency of the momentum , and the particle spin direction would follow that of the momentum . if @xmath82 , the angle between the polarization and momentum direction vectors will change .",
    "the angle @xmath83 of particle spin rotation relative to the particle momentum direction is @xmath84 , where the time @xmath85 , with @xmath86 being the path length traveled by the channeled particle in the bent crystal . from this follows that the rotation angle per unit path length @xmath87    let us also remember that the magnetic moment of the particle with spin @xmath88 is related to the gyromagnetic ( land ) factor @xmath89 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the particle mass .",
    "when @xmath92 we can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the bohr magneton .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the force responsible for rotating the particle momentum that should be equal to the centrifugal force @xmath97 ; @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the radius of curvature of the channel . from this",
    "we have @xmath100 we shall take into account that @xmath101 equals the value of the momentum s angle of rotation @xmath102 .",
    "hence , @xmath103    equation ( [ e16 ] ) was derived by v. lyuboshitz using the bmt equation @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ e2 ] ) that the spin rotation angle per unit path length ( the angle of rotation per 1 cm ) is @xmath104 on the other hand , the equality @xmath105 yields @xmath106 .    the quantity @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the particle s potential energy in the channel .",
    "as a consequence , we have @xmath109 the minimum value of the radius of curvature ( the critical radius ) @xmath8 required for the motion in a bent channel to be still possible for ceratin @xmath110 is achieved at maximum @xmath111 . consequently",
    ", the maximum rotation angle per unit * length * is @xmath112    as is seen , the maximum spin rotation angle @xmath113 is energy - independent .",
    "however , at @xmath114 , the capturing acceptance ( the fraction of particles captured into channeling regime ) vanishes @xcite . for certain @xmath115 , the spin rotation angle can be written in the form @xmath116 as a result , we can see that for the given ratio @xmath117 , the angle @xmath118 is energy - independent , too .",
    "the dechanneling length increases as the energy is increased @xcite .",
    "this enables us to increase the rotation angle by increasing the length of the bent crystal channel @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the dechanneling length . for protons with energies higher than @xmath121 gev , the length @xmath122 cm .",
    "according to @xcite , channeling of protons in 15-cm - long si crystals is currently available .",
    "as reported in @xcite , for si , @xmath123 gev cm@xmath19 , and hence the rotation angle per 1 cm path length in a si crystal is @xmath125 according to the estimates @xcite , for a particle with mass @xmath126 gev , the @xmath89-factor lies in the range @xmath127 . from this",
    "we get the minimum value of the ratio @xmath128 .",
    "taking @xmath129 ( in which case the dechanneling length is maximum @xcite ) , we obtain that for @xmath2 , the rotation angle per unit length in a bent silicon crystal equals @xmath130 for @xmath131 , we have @xmath132rad ; for @xmath133 cm , we have @xmath134rad .",
    "thus , if the ratio @xmath135 remains constant , the value of the spin rotation angle appears to be constant and rather large in a wide range of energies .",
    "the decrease in the lindhard angle @xmath136 with increasing energy seemingly impairs the observation conditions .",
    "however , as the energy is increased , the angular width @xmath137 in which the produced particles move is @xmath138 , and hence the fraction of particles captured into the channel is increased with energy as @xmath139 . according to @xcite , as the energy is increased , the probability of @xmath2 production also increases . for this reason , the increase in energy leads to an increasing number of usable events , i.e. , the number of deflected @xmath2 entering the detector .",
    "for example , if the energy of @xmath2 is increased from 300 gev to 3 tev , the number of produced @xmath2 increases tenfold if the linear growth of the production cross section for @xmath2 , suggested in @xcite , continues as the energy of the incident protons rises .",
    "moreover , the amount of @xmath2 captured into channeling regime is increased threefold .",
    "as a result , the time required to observe the effect is reduced .",
    "when a particle travels through a crystal , the field @xmath140 at the point of particle location takes on random values .",
    "this is due to fluctuations of the position of the nucleus ( electron ) in the crystal ( in particular , under thermal vibrations ) and to fluctuations of the electric field that come from particle scattering by various atomic chains .",
    "the fluctuations of the field @xmath13 lead to the stochastic spin precession frequency in the electric field .    owing to the presence of fluctuations of the spin rotation frequency , the spin rotation angle of any particle that has traveled through a crystal takes on different values . as a result , after passing through a target ,",
    "every particle has a different direction of the polarization vector @xmath141 , and the distribution of the particle spin direction in the beam may even become isotropic , i.e. , the beam polarization vector goes to zero .",
    "the stochasticity of @xmath66 leads to spin depolarization of particles moving in the crystal @xcite .    according to @xcite , depolarization of particles in the case of scattering by crystal planes ( axes )",
    "is determined by the intensity of multiple scattering by crystal planes ( axes ) .",
    "it was shown that depolarization has practically no effect on the possibility of measuring the magnetic moment of particles moving in bent crystals in channeling regime .",
    "a much stronger depolarization is observed for the particles that are not involved in the channeling regime .",
    "these particles may undergo collisions with atomic chains as a whole .",
    "this leads to a sharp increase in the root - mean - square angle of multiple scattering and , as a consequence , to a large depolarization .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the longitudinal polarization @xmath142 of particles undergoing scattering by the axes decreases as @xmath143 @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the mean square angle of multiple scattering of the particle by the crystal axes per 1 centimeter path length in the crystal . according to @xcite , the mean square angle of particle scattering by the crystal axes for a path length @xmath21 traveled in the crystal",
    "can be written as @xmath146 so we have @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 is the atomic number , @xmath150 is the number of atoms per @xmath151 , @xmath152 is the numerical coefficient equal to 1.16 for the axial potential in the lindhard model , and @xmath153 is the angle between the direction of the particle momentum and the crystallographic axis ; @xmath154{z}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the screening radius , @xmath156 is the distance between the axes , and the @xmath37-axis is parallel to the crystallographic axis ; @xmath157 is the ratio between the charge of a particle and that of an electron .",
    "for example , for particles with the parameters of the proton ( i.e. , @xmath158 , @xmath159mev ) , we have for w - type crystals the magnitude @xmath160 and , according to the value of @xmath153 , it may reach @xmath161 , i.e. , for crystal thickness of the order of 1 cm , the depolarization may amount to a few tens of percent .",
    "equation ( [ nim90_1.40 ] ) is valid for @xmath153 , which are larger than the lindhard angle @xmath162 ( @xmath163 is the averaged axial potential ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ nim90_1.39 ] ) and ( [ ins_nim90_1.40 ] ) that @xmath164    when the particle energy corresponds to @xmath7 , from ( [ nim90_1.39 ] ) and ( [ ins_nim90_1.40 ] ) we may obtain the following expression for @xmath165 @xcite : @xmath166    let us note that for electrons and positrons , as reported in @xcite , the experiments on spin rotation in bent crystals provide a unique possibility for studying the effects of quantum electrodynamics of a strong field , namely , the dependence of the anomalous magnetic moment , i.e. , @xmath167 , on the crystal electric field intensity and the particle energy .",
    "the same possibility exists in studying the depolarization of @xmath168 .",
    "thus , with experimentally determined values of @xmath169 and @xmath170 , we can find the value of ( @xmath171 ) , which gives us another possibility to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of particles .",
    "it is noteworthy that strong fluctuating fields act on neutral particles moving at a small angle to the crystal axes ( planes ) , too , leading to the depolarization of their spin , which fact can be used to measure the magnetic moment of neutral partticles .",
    "we should pay attention to the fact that theoretical considerations and experimental results both reveal that @xmath172 produced through collisions between nonpolarized nucleons and nonpolarized nucleons ( nuclei ) are polarized , and their polarization vector is oriented orthogonally to the reaction plane , i.e. , the plane where the momenta of the incident nucleon and the produced baryon lie .",
    "a similar situation would occur in production of other baryons charm and beauty .",
    "this is why the reaction amplitude @xmath173 includes the term of the form @xmath174\\ ] ] where @xmath175 is the spin of the produced particle , @xmath176 is the momentum of the incident particle , and @xmath177 is the momentum of the produced baryon .",
    "consequently , the polarization component @xmath178 of the produced baryon that is parallel to the momentum @xmath177 equals zero .",
    "depolarization occurs to the polarization vector component @xmath179 lying in the plane transverse relative to vector @xmath177 .",
    "let the produced baryon be incident on the crystal axis at a small angle @xmath180 ( according to @xcite , @xmath181{z}$ ] ) . the baryon s velocity component parallel to the axes @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the particle velocity .",
    "the component @xmath184 of the particle s initial velocity is orthogonal to the axis , and @xmath185 .",
    "let us choose the @xmath36-axis along vector @xmath186 .",
    "multiple scattering leads to appearing of the velocity s component @xmath187 that is orthogonal to the @xmath36-axis , and the changes in @xmath187 are much greater than those in @xmath188 in the direction of the @xmath36-axis . as a consequence , multiple scattering by the axes is strongly asymmetric in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the baryon momentum @xcite .",
    "this means that the depolarization is also asymmetric in this plane , i.e. , @xmath189 .",
    "for this reason , the maximum depolarization of the produced baryons can be obtained if the crystal axes are oriented in such a way that the initial vector of baryon polarization is oriented in the direction of the @xmath33-axis . according to @xcite , the component @xmath190 of the polarization vector relates to @xmath21 as @xmath191.\\ ] ]",
    "let us recall that in view of the analysis @xcite , the contributions to multiple scattering by the axes come not only from the averaged potential , but also from particle scattering by the fluctuations of the potential of the axes that are due to thermal oscillations of atoms . as a result , @xmath192 @xcite , where @xmath193 is the mean square angle of multiple scattering due to thermal oscillations and @xmath194 is the mean square angle of multiple scattering due to scattering by averaged over thermal oscillations potential of the axes .",
    "let us also note that @xmath195 , that is , @xmath196 is independent of the particle energy .",
    "it also follows from ( [ new2 ] ) that @xmath197    in our further estimations we shall consider only the contribution coming from multiple scattering by the averaged over thermal oscillations potential of the axes @xmath198 and assume that @xmath199 .    as a result",
    ", we have the following expression for the damping rate @xmath200 where @xmath201 is defined by ( [ nim90_1.40 ] ) .",
    "thus , the depolarization rate in this case is similar to that in ( [ nim90_1.39 ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath2 be incident on the crystal .",
    "for our estimate we use the value of the @xmath89-factor given in @xcite : @xmath202 .",
    "the minimum value is estimated as @xmath203 .",
    "so we have the following estimate for @xmath201 in tungsten ( w ) : @xmath204 ( the beam is assumed to be incident on the axes at an angle of about several lindhard angles ) ; then for the length @xmath205 cm , for example , @xmath206 .",
    "hence , the polarization in this case decreases by a factor of @xmath207 , i.e. , quite appreciably .",
    "more precise estimates require thorough simulations , but even the estimates given here indicate that this phenomenon can hopefully be used for negatively - charged beauty baryons .",
    "now , let us note that when moving in the crystal , such particles as baryons ( antibaryons and nuclei ) take part not only in electromagnetic , but also in strong interactions . as a result ,",
    "the spatially periodic effective potential energy of interaction between a particle and a crystal is determined by two interactions : coulomb and strong @xcite .",
    "the effective periodic potential @xmath208 can be introduced to describe the passage of a coherent wave in the crystal : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the reciprocal lattice vector of the crystal , @xmath211 here @xmath212 is the volume of the crystal elementary cell , @xmath213 is the coordinate of the atom ( nucleus ) of type @xmath214 in the crystal elementary cell , and the squared @xmath215 equals the thermal - factor ( i.e. , the debye - waller factor ) , well - known for x - ray scattering @xcite : @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the mass of the incident particle , @xmath110 is its lorentz - factor , @xmath218 is the amplitude of elastic coherent scattering of the particle by the atom , @xmath219 is the wave vector of the incident wave , and @xmath220 is the wave vector of the scattered wave .    it will be recalled that in the case of a crystal , the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath221 does not contain the contribution from the total cross section of elastic coherent scattering . the imaginary part of @xmath221 in a crystal is only determined by the total cross sections of inelastic processes .",
    "this occurs because in a crystal , unlike in amorphous matter , the wave elastically scattered at a nonzero angle , due to rescattering by periodically located centers , is involved in formation of a coherent wave propagating through the crystal .",
    "elastic coherent scattering of a particle by an atom is caused by both the coulomb interaction of the particle with the atom s electrons and nucleus and its nuclear interaction with the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the scattering amplitude can be presented as a sum of two amplitudes : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the amplitude of particle scattering caused by the coulomb interaction with the atom ( nucleus ) ( it contains contributions from the coulomb interaction of the particle with the atom along with the spin - orbit interaction with the coulomb field of the atom ( nucleus ) ) ; @xmath224 is the amplitude of elastic coherent scattering of the particle caused by the nuclear interaction ( this amplitude contains the terms independent of the incident particle spin along with the terms depending on spin of both the incident particle and nucleus , in particular , spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath208 and @xmath225 can also be expressed : @xmath226 let us suppose that a high energy particle moves in a crystal at a small angle to the crystallographic planes ( axes ) close to the lindhard angle @xmath227 ( in a relativistic case @xmath228 ) , where @xmath78 is the energy of the particle , @xmath163 is the height of the potential barrier created by the crystallographic plane ( axis ) .",
    "this motion is determined by the plane ( axis ) potential @xmath229 , which could be derived from @xmath230 by averaging over the distribution of atoms ( nuclei ) in the crystal plane ( axis ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the potential @xmath231 for a particle channeled in a plane ( or axis ) channel or moving over the barrier at a small angle , close to the lindhard angle , can be expressed as a sum @xcite : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the potential energy of particle coulomb interaction with the crystallographic plane ( axis ) , @xmath234 is the energy of spin - orbit interaction with the coulomb field of the plane ( axis ) and spin - orbit nuclear interaction with the effective nuclear field of the plane ( axis ) , and @xmath235 is the effective potential energy of nuclear interaction of the incident particle with the crystallographic plane ( axis ) .",
    "@xmath236 where @xmath237 is the density of nuclei at point @xmath238 of the crystallographic plane ( axis ) , the @xmath37-axis is directed along the crystal axis ( along the velocity component parallel to the crystallographic plane in the case of plane channeling ) , @xmath239 is the amplitude of elastic coherent forward scattering , which depends on the incident particle spin and nucleus polarization , @xmath240 is the energy of magnetic interaction of the particle with the magnetic field produced by the electrons ( nuclei ) .",
    "thus in describing particle motion in crystals , the contribution of strong interactions to the formation of the effective potential acting on the particle from the crystallographic planes ( axes ) should be considered along with the coulomb interaction . in the case of high energies , the particle motion in the potential @xmath241",
    "can be described in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "the spin - evolution equations for a particle moving in straight and bent crystals in the presence of the contribution from @xmath242 is discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us assume now that the crystal nuclei are polarized .",
    "the cross section of high - energy particle scattering by a nucleus ( the amplitude of zero - angle scattering ) in a crystal with polarized nuclei depends on the particle spin orientation with respect to the polarization of the target .",
    "therefore , the absorption coefficient also depends on particle spin orientation .",
    "let a particle move in a crystal at a small angle to the crystallographic plane ( axis ) close to the lindhard angle .",
    "in this case the coefficient of particle absorption by nuclei can differ from the absorption coefficient for the particle moving in the crystal at a large angle to the crystallographic plane ( axis ) .",
    "moreover , it can appear to be greater even for positively - charged particles .",
    "let us discuss the possibility to use a polarized crystal to obtain a polarized beam of high - energy particles and to analyze the polarization state of high - energy particles @xcite .",
    "let us consider a positively - charged , high - energy particle moving close to the top of the potential barrier .",
    "therefore , it moves in the range with nuclei density higher than that of an amorphous medium . in this range ,",
    "the growth is described by @xmath243 here @xmath244 is the lattice period , @xmath245 is the amplitude of the nucleus thermal oscillations . for the over - barrier motion in the vicinity of the crystallographic axis ,",
    "the growth is described by the relation @xmath246    after passing through the polarized crystal of thickness @xmath86 , the particles moving in the region where the crystal nuclei are located acquire the polarization degree that can be described by formula @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the total scattering cross section for the particle whose spin is parallel to the polarization vector of nuclei and @xmath249 is the total scattering cross section for the particle whose spin is anti - parallel to the polarization vector of nuclei . to avoid misunderstanding",
    ", it will be recalled that the exponential absorption law holds true if the characteristic scattering angle of a particle is much larger than the angle at which the observer from the point of target location may see the input window of the detector , registering the flux of particles transmitted through the target . in the opposite case",
    "all of the scattered particles enter the detector , and by @xmath250 one should mean the total cross section of absorption and reactions that remove the particle from the incident beam ( causing appreciable change in its energy ) .",
    "the density matrix techniques should be used as a tool in considering the general case .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is determined by the parameter @xmath251 . with @xmath252 being the average density of nuclei in the crystal , @xmath253 for a plane and @xmath254 for an axis .",
    "the length @xmath255 corresponding to @xmath256 is @xmath257 . if we suppose that @xmath258 and @xmath259@xmath260 , then for a plane @xmath261 cm and for an axis @xmath262 cm .",
    "as is seen , in this case a beam of polarized particles can be obtained using rather small - sized polarized targets .",
    "let positively - charged particles move parallel to a crystallographic plane . in this case , most of them appear close to the bottom of the potential well and far from the nuclei , therefore , the absorption coefficient for this fraction of particles is smaller comparing to the average crystal absorption",
    "nevertheless , in this case there is also a fraction of particles that moves in the region where the nuclei are located .",
    "a fraction of particles moving near the barrier can be sorted out by means of angular distribution or by using bent crystals . moving in a bent crystal ,",
    "the fraction of channeled particles that due to coulomb repulsion is hardly involved in the nuclear interaction is deflected from the initial direction of motion .",
    "thus the particles that have undergone the interaction with the nuclei will change the beam moving in the initial direction .",
    "because the absorption for this fraction of particles increases , it becomes possible to achieve quite a significant polarization of the initially nonpolarized beam .",
    "a bent crystal can be used to increase the interaction of a positively - charged particle with a nucleus , too . in this case",
    ", the centrifugal forces push the channeled beam to the range with high density of nuclei . a detailed analysis of the polarization state of transient particles",
    "requires a numerical simulation .",
    "in contrast to positively charged particles , negatively charged particles ( for example , @xmath263 hyperons , antiprotons , and beauty hyperons ) , being channeled , move in the region with high density of nuclei , therefore , even a very thin polarized crystal ( @xmath264 cm ) can be an effective polarizer and polarization analyzer .",
    "moreover , for a negatively - charged channeled particle , the angle of spin rotation in the nuclear pseudo - magnetic field of the polarized crystal @xcite can be larger than that for amorphous matter @xcite .",
    "this is the reason for the thin polarized crystals to be used as nuclear - optical elements that can guide polarization of high - energy particle beams .",
    "note that because of the presence of the amplitude similar to that in ( [ new1 ] ) , the spin - orbit interaction also leads to particle polarization , as well as to the left ",
    "right asymmetry in scattering of polarized particles ( both charged and neutral ) .",
    "the density of nuclei near the axis is much higher than the density of an amorphous target .",
    "this makes the induced polarization ( left  right asymmetry ) for particles scattered by the crystal axes noticeably higher , as compared with amorphous matter , due to interference of the coulomb and nuclear interactions @xcite . in this context , intensively developing techniques for collimating and handling the beams of high - energy particles , using the volume reflection of charged particles from bent crystal planes deserve attention @xcite-@xcite . in particular , according to @xcite , multiple volume reflection from different planes of one bent crystal becomes possible when particles move at a small angle with respect to the crystal axis .",
    "such multiple volume reflection enables a severalfold increase in the particle deflection angle inside one crystal .",
    "this effect is experimentally revealed now , and it is noteworthy that it leads to an increasing probability of particle - nucleus interaction .",
    "channeling of particles in either straight or bent crystals with polarized nuclei could be used to polarize high - energy particles or analyze their polarization .",
    "the beam of nonpolarized particles extracted from the storage ring could be significantly polarized by applying the additional polarized bent ( straight ) crystal .",
    "a few more words should be said about the possibility of quadrupole moment measurements for @xmath263-hyperons moving in a crystal @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates of the quadrupole moment of short - lived particles , for instance of an @xmath263-hyperon @xcite , based on the nonrelativistic quark model depend on the model parameters and can differ significantly .",
    "experimental measurement of the quantity under consideration using the convenient method of passing through an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field is at present practically unrealizable because of the smallness of quadrupole interaction at attainable strengths of the electromagnetic field .    despite the seeming simplicity ,",
    "the use of the effect of spin oscillation of @xmath263-hyperons channeled in crystals is a challenging task , too .",
    "this is , above all , due to the sharp increase of multiple scattering by nuclei in the case of negatively - charged particles ( @xmath263-hyperons ) .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the difficulties can be overcome to a great extent using the effect of spin oscillation occurring in a nonchanneled state of motion ( not too far above the critical angle ) relative to the chosen family of crystallographic planes for particles with spin @xmath265 .",
    "the equations describing the spin dynamics of a particle possessing magnetic and quadrupole moments can be derived using the results obtained in @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the relativistic equation of spin motion in this case has the following form : @xmath266 where @xmath267 is a component of the vector @xmath268v^{2}\\vec{\\omega}_{0}$ ] and @xmath269 .",
    "let us consider ( [ hyperon_1.8 ] ) under the condition that the particle moves in a nonchanneled state at an angle @xmath270 with respect to the chosen family of crystallographic planes , where @xmath271 is the lindhard angle .",
    "suppose that the coordinate axis @xmath36 is perpendicular to the given crystallographic planes .",
    "taking into account that @xmath272 , @xmath273 , we obtain @xmath274 @xmath275 @xmath276    equations ( [ hyperon_1.8])([hyperon_1.9c ] ) enable one to analyze whether the spin oscillation of a particle moving in a nonchanneled state can be used for measuring the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath263-hyperon .    in view of ( [ hyperon_1.9a])([hyperon_1.9c ] ) , when a particle with a quadrupole moment moves in a crystal , not only spin oscillation and rotation appear , but also the transitions between tensor @xmath277 and vector @xmath278 polarizations of the particle .",
    "as follows from ( [ hyperon_1.8])-([hyperon_1.9c ] ) , under the initial conditions @xmath279 and @xmath280 , there is a maximal change of the @xmath263-hyperon spin projection @xmath281 due to the quadrupole interaction .    according to the estimates made in @xcite , in such experiments for the @xmath263-hyperon beam with lorentz factor @xmath282 , intensity @xmath283 particle / s , and the beam divergence angle @xmath284mrad ,",
    "it is possible to measure the quadrupole moment @xmath285 of the @xmath263-hyperon on the level @xmath286@xmath62 in a tungsten crystal of length @xmath287 cm .",
    "it should be noted that the measurement scheme suggested here for @xmath263-hyperon quadrupole moment measurements requires neither a high quality crystal nor a monochromatic hyperon beam ! for the realization of this measuring procedure it is quite sufficient to have a crystal with a mosaic spread @xmath288mrad or a set of crystals arranged with an exactness of not more than @xmath289mrad relative to the chosen family of crystallographic planes .",
    "this condition justifies the possibility of creating large crystal systems necessary for carrying out this experiment .",
    "the analysis given in this paper shows that the phenomena of spin rotation and depolarization of high - energy particles in crystals at energies that will be available at lhc and fcc can be used to measure the anomalous magnetic moments of short - lived particles at such energies .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that for negatively - charged particles ( e.g. , beauty baryons ) , the phenomenon of spin depolarization in crystals is a promising tool allowing the anomalous magnetic moment measurements .",
    "moreover it has been noted that the spin depolarization effect occurs for neutral particles incident at small angles to crystal axes ( planes ) , and this opens the potential for magnetic moment measurements of such short - lived particles .",
    "channeling of particles in either straight or bent crystals with polarized nuclei could be used for polarization or polarization analysis of high - energy particles , including neutral particles .",
    "depolarization and spin rotation of that fraction of neutral particles which moves in the region of high concentration of nuclei can be defined by particle reactions in the crystal : if at a certain point the particle is scattered at a large angle , this means that it has undergone a collision , and hence it was in the vicinity of the nuclei . at high energies , particles move along a straight line .",
