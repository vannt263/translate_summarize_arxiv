    "the transition probability is extracted by detecting the dots configuration @xmath157 .",

    "we analyze the measurement signal for arbitrary parameters strengths .",
    "the analysys of the general - strength measurement can be formulated in terms of generalised positive operator valued measurements ( povm ) , which describe all possible outcomes of the charge configurations of the dots .",
    "the different outcomes of a charge measurement are then labelled by all possible combinations of @xmath127 .",
    "the process can formally be described in terms of kraus operators    @xmath159    where @xmath160 , @xmath160 are the state of empty left and right dots respectively , and @xmath161 @xmath162 denotes the trace over the degrees of freedoms of the left and right dots ( detectors ) .",
    "the probability to obtain a specific outcome @xmath163 and the corresponding state after the measurement are given by @xmath164    the signal we are interested in is determined by the kraus operator @xmath165 .",

    "it is interesting to note that for long time and/or strong coupling , the measurement does not approach a strong projective measurement .",
    "this can be seen from eq . , which generically is not a projector ( e.g. @xmath178 ) .",
    "this feature is due to the finite dimension of the hilbert space of the quantum dots used as an ancilla in the detection scheme . in this case",
    "the measurement time and coupling constants enter the kraus operator through the superposition of a finite number of of periodic functions .",

    "the proposed scheme can be therefore used as a test for chsh inequalities even beyond the weak coupling limit . however",
    ", for intermediate measurement strength , the detector calibration requires a fine - tuning of the coupling time .",
    "this has to be compared with the weak measurement regime where a power of @xmath130 appears as a common prefactor of the detector signal .",
    "therefore , although the proposed measurement scheme works for arbitrarily strength of the measurements and coupling time , the weak measurement regime offers a more general form of the detector s signal , which , in turns , reduces the need for fine tuning in a given experimental setup .",

    "<S> a few aspects of the measurement procedure are noteworthy . </S>",
    "<S> we first comment that the operators of the left and of the right set commute . </S>",
    "<S> it thus follows that they can be measured simultaneously ; non - universal details of the time sequence concerning on - and - off switching of the tunneling matrix elements are immaterial . </S>",

    "<S> finally , although the proposed measurement protocol is in principle feasible , it requires control of the individual tunnel matrix elements between the dots and the wires in order to measure different operators . </S>",
    "<S> this might present an experimental challenge . </S>",
    "<S> other variants of the protocol may be better suited to experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the operators needed for this protocol may be designed by controlling individual qd s energy levels , or possibly by majorana - to - charge conversion measurements @xcite .    [ </S>",
    "<S> [ conclusions ] ] conclusions + + + + + + + + + + +    we have identified a minimal complexity mbs array : a junction with 6 segments delineating an 8-fold degenerate subspace defined by 6 majorana end points . unlike paradigmatic quantum states of two spin-@xmath59 particles that may ( e.g. spin singlet ) or may not ( spin triplet-@xmath151 ) be entangled </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that _ any _ state in the 4-dimensional fixed - parity degenerate space ( e.g. , odd parity ) is _ non - locally entangled_. this comes with a minimal bound on the violation of the chsh inequality ( eq . ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also presented a detector design , amenable to experimental implementation , and showed how to obtain chsh correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we discussed the limit of a weak measurement protocol . </S>",
    "<S> this ubiquitous non - locality , expressed through non - local entanglement , reflects the intrinsic property of mbs as carriers of fractionalized fermionic degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> verification of non - local entanglement requires repeated measurements of chsh correlations on replica of the same state , with at least 4 different partitioning ( into @xmath25 and @xmath26 sets ) of the majorana degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the chsh inequality will be broken for at least one of these partitioning . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the operators associated with different partitionings may be achieved through tuning of the majorana - qds couplings , representing non - projective measurements . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a recent work @xcite has used the generation of entanglement to demonstrate how a newly designed gate may extend the possible set of operations with mbss to form a framework for universal quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generalizations of the present analysis will involve @xmath152 mbs junctions , as well as designs consisting of parafermions .    </S>",
