    "the entropy is a key quantity in the study of the thermodynamical ( td ) properties of fermionic systems . in the context of correlated fermi liquids ,",
    "the study of the entropy has been triggered by the experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath1he @xcite .",
    "the specific heat of this system is experimentally known to have a non - trivial temperature dependence @xcite of the type @xmath2 .",
    "such a non - analytical behaviour can be seen to arise within fermi liquid theory from the coupling between quasi - particles and incoherent spin fluctuations ( quasi - holes in the triplet state ) , which give rise to non - analytical energy dependences in the self - energy @xcite .",
    "these non - analyticities are in fact a very general feature of all normal fermi liquids and their existence",
    "is not related to the particular details of @xmath1he systems .    hot symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , on the other hand , is an infinite fermionic system composed of nucleons at very high densities . in this ideal system ,",
    "only the strong interaction among nucleons is considered and any other interaction , such as the electromagnetic one between protons , is neglected .",
    "the temperatures usually considered for this system are of the order of tenths of mev and are somewhat small if compared with the typical energy scales of nuclear matter ( the free fermi energy at saturation density is about @xmath3 mev , thus @xmath4 for @xmath5 mev , the highest temperatures considered here ) .",
    "we expect that a finite temperature approach to snm can fairly describe the properties of the hot environments that could exist either inside the cores of supernovae at the latest stage of their evolution @xcite or in the collisions of heavy nuclei at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "the td properties of these systems and , in particular , the entropy are important quantities for the understanding of astrophysical and heavy ion physics phenomena . in core - collapse supernovae , for instance , the evolution and dynamics occur at a fixed entropy per baryon @xcite .",
    "moreover , the entropy production in multi - fragmentation events in heavy ion collisions is considered to be a crucial quantity to determine the mass fragment distribution @xcite .",
    "hot snm has been usually studied in a mean - field approximation with effective phenomenological nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces , such as the skyrme or gogny interactions @xcite , or within a relativistic mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "other many - body approaches that have been used in the study of snm include lattice models @xcite or three - loop calculations within chiral perturbation theory at finite temperature @xcite",
    ". however , when dealing with realistic nn potentials , more sophisticated many - body techniques are needed . the strong short range repulsion and the tensor components of these potentials",
    "modify substantially the many - body wave function , which is not anymore well described in terms of a free fermi gas slater determinant .",
    "particle - particle correlations , for instance , are crucial for a correct description of snm properties from realistic nn potentials . the brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock ( bhf ) approach accounts for such correlations by means of a summation of an infinite series of suitable ladder diagrams @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bhf approximation arises from a well - defined expansion for the energy of a fermionic system at zero temperature , the so - called brueckner  bethe ",
    "goldstone expansion @xcite . at finite temperature",
    ", a similar summation can be achieved in the so - called bloch  de dominicis ( bdd ) approach @xcite . however , this approach is no devised to reproduce the energy of the system .",
    "instead , it aims to compute the td grand - potential and , from it , all the td properties of the system .",
    "in particular , the entropy includes the correlations embedded in the approach @xcite .",
    "traditionally , however , the bhf approach has been extended to finite temperatures in a more naive way : the energy of the system is computed from a simple generalization of the @xmath6 formalism to finite temperature and the entropy of the system is computed from a mean - field expression @xcite .",
    "finally , let us also note that relativistic bhf - type calculation at finite temperature have also been performed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a consistent treatment of correlations in quantum many - body systems requires the inclusion of particle - particle and hole - hole scattering terms .",
    "the usual approach is the so - called ladder approximation or @xmath0-matrix approximation , in which an expansion of the single - particle green s function in terms of diagrams is achieved .",
    "such an expansion goes beyond the bhf approach in the sense that both the propagation of particles and holes are treated in the same footing . within this approach ,",
    "the propagator of a correlated fermion is not simply described in terms of one quasi - particle pole . instead",
    ", the strength of a momentum state _ k _ is fragmented over a wide range of energies .",
    "the process of finding the green s function for such a many - body system is unavoidably self - consistent , since the propagation of a nucleon is affected by the interactions with the surrounding nucleons , which in turn are also described in terms of green s function .",
    "although one can easily write down the diagrammatic expansion that gives rise to this self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) , it has taken a lot of time to have a numerical solution of the full problem .",
    "a major well known issue is related to the so - called pairing instability that appears in the zero temperature formalism when the propagation of holes is considered @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , calculations have been performed at the scgf level at zero temperature within different approximations : with a quasi - particle self - consistent approach @xcite , with a discretized parameterization of the spectral function @xcite or with a simplified separable nn interaction @xcite . in all these approaches the final output is the single - particle spectral function of a nucleon inside matter , which can also be obtained from other many - body approaches , such as the correlated basis function theory @xcite .    in the case of scgf",
    ", a finite temperature treatment has been the keystone for obtaining a complete numerical solution from a realistic nn potential @xcite . once the self - consistent propagator is obtained in this method",
    ", one can easily obtain information on the microscopic properties ( such as the momentum distributions , self - energies or spectral functions of the nucleon ) as well as on the bulk properties of the system ( the energy per particle via the galitski - migdal - koltun ( gmk ) sum rule , for instance @xcite ) . for a complete td description of the system",
    ", however , one should compute the relevant td potential of a statistical quantum mechanical system , _",
    "i.e. _ the free energy",
    ". a suitable calculation of the entropy is thus required if this formalism is to be used in any practical description of hot snm . here",
    ", we will follow the luttinger - ward ( lw ) approach @xcite , in which the grand - potential is computed from the full single - particle propagator .",
    "an analysis of the properties of snm within this formalism has been recently published by soma _",
    "_ @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall show that one does not need to compute td quantities within a full lw approach as done in @xcite , provided that some approximations for the entropy are valid .",
    "finally , let us notice that the lw formalism has been widely used in other many - body physics problems , ranging from relativistic plasmas @xcite to resonances in heavy ion collisions @xcite .    in the following section , we will describe in detail the scgf approach at finite temperature and the lw formalism that we will use in our calculations of the entropy .",
    "the numerical results derived from this formalism will be divided in two different parts .",

    "finally , a brief summary will be given in section v.",
    "with the help of the single - particle propagator , we can obtain all the one - body ( and even some two - body ) properties of a many - body system @xcite . in the green s function approach ,",

    ", we will neglect the spin - isospin structure of this propagator in the following . finally , the traces @xmath17 are to be taken over all the energy and particle number eigenstates of the system .",
    "the cyclic invariance of these traces imply the following quasiperiodicity condition for the green s function : @xmath18 one can thus fourier transform the time dependence of the propagator in terms of some fourier coefficients @xmath19 , depending on the discrete matsubara frequencies @xmath20 .",
    "a lehmann decomposition of these coefficients is achieved by means of the spectral function @xmath21 : @xmath22 the function @xmath19 evaluated at the matsubara frequencies can be analytically continued for all non - real @xmath23 . using the plemelj formula , the spectral function can be related with the values of @xmath24 close to the real axis ( we use the notation @xmath25 ) : @xmath26    the single - particle green s function can be obtained from dyson s equation , which for a translationally invariant system reduces to the algebraic equation : @xmath27 g(k,\\omega ) & = & 1 \\ , , \\label{eq : dyson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes a complex self energy . by expanding the self - energy in terms of one - particle green s function , it can be shown that @xmath29 and @xmath24 share the same analytic properties .",

    "the numerical values confirm that at low temperatures the density of states from the @xmath136 spectral function reduces to the quasi - particle one , hence indicating that from a td point of view this is the correct density of states .",
    "however , from a microscopic point of view , the @xmath63 density of states is the one which has been commonly used @xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind that in a mean - field approximation both of them would reduce to the same expression , eq .",

    "( [ eq : n0_qp ] ) ( both of them evaluated at the corresponding finite temperature ) , and we use them instead of @xmath222 in eq .  ( [ eq : s_low ] ) , we can reproduce the dq expression of the entropy for temperatures up to @xmath181 mev with less than a @xmath209 % discrepancy .",
    "in the context of nucleus - nucleus collisions at intermediate energies , there exists a growing amount of experimental data @xcite which should be useful to constrain the thermal properties of nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "in particular , the liquid - gas phase transition and the caloric curve give a hint on the properties of nuclei at low temperatures .",
    "in the study of the caloric curve , it is customary to parameterize the excitation energy at low temperatures in terms of the so - called inverse level density parameter @xmath229 ( see @xcite for a theoretical description ) , which is inversely proportional to the density of states introduced here .",

    "let us also note that the inclusion of the hole - hole propagation in the quasi - particle peaks tends to increase the entropy .",
    "the @xmath63 spectral function contribution to the entropy is again correct in the temperature behaviour , but still it gives a too small value for the entropy per particle of the system , with errors as large as a @xmath234 % . as we have previously discussed , this is due to the lower quasiparticle peak of the @xmath63 spectral function , which makes the @xmath156 contribution to the entropy lower than the @xmath117 entropy .",
    "the difference between these two functions is given by the @xmath214 contribution to the entropy .",
    "this is composed of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_a2 ] ) , which have different relative weights as temperature changes . while the term proportional to the @xmath63 spectral function amounts to @xmath235 % of the total correction at @xmath193 mev , its relative importance decreases linearly to a @xmath234 % contribution for the @xmath5 mev case .    finally , the entropy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_nk ] ) is given in terms of the fully correlated momentum distributions .",
    "this momentum distribution includes both thermal effects ( which are capital for any entropy computation ) plus correlation effects .",
    "in fact , in the final entropy @xmath218 both effects are taken as the same and correlations somehow mimic extra thermal effects .",
    "this is why this is the only approximation which tends to give a non - zero entropy at @xmath6 . in the",
    "fully degenerate limit , the momentum distributions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nk ] ) are not fermi step functions and they are corrected by correlation effects .",
    "these correlations are the responsible for a certain amount of entropy , when this is computed with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_nk ] ) at @xmath6 .",
    "thus , at finite temperatures thermal effects are overestimated in @xmath218 due to the presence of correlations , and @xmath218 produces a far too large entropy ( almost a factor of three too large at @xmath236 mev ) .",

    "the ladder approximation is known to be @xmath86-derivable @xcite .",

    "the derivative has been performed numerically after adjusting @xmath165 to a third - order polynomial .",

    "the fulfilment of td consistency for the scgf approach is nicely illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : td ] .",
    "the agreement between @xmath162 and @xmath16 is very good above @xmath240 @xmath180 , with discrepancies of less than 1 mev up to @xmath241 @xmath180 . as a consequence ,",
    "the hugenholtz - van hove theorem is also very well fulfilled , and the minimum of @xmath166 and @xmath162 do nicely coincide at about @xmath242 @xmath180 .",
    "the situation for the bhf approach , on the other hand , is much worse , as it is very well known @xcite . the chemical potentials @xmath162 and @xmath16 differ by about @xmath209 mev at @xmath179 @xmath180 and by almost @xmath234 mev at the highest density here considered .",
    "in addition , the hugenholtz - van hove theorem is badly violated , and the value of @xmath166 at saturation differs from @xmath162 by about @xmath167 mev . finally , we note that the propagation of holes seems to have a global repulsive effect on the free - energy .",
    "such a repulsive effect has already been detected for the energy per particle @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the differences in free energies between the bhf and the scgf are smaller than the differences in energies , due to the different entropy contributions .",
    "the results presented here should be taken as a first step towards a full treatment of the thermal properties of infinite nuclear matter within a formalism that includes short - range correlations in a td consistent way . from our point of view",
    ", this formalism can find several applications within the many - body and nuclear physics community .",
    "a first outcome could be , for instance , the study of the liquid - gas phase transition of symmetric nuclear matter from a realistic nn potential .",
    "a critical study of the usually assumed low - temperature dependences for the relevant td properties of matter ( of the type @xmath243 ) could also be assessed .",
    "other applications , such as the study of the finite temperature equation of state , will probably demand for an inclusion of three - body forces in the formalism in order to reproduce the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter . as for the possible consequences of our results for the study of intermediate energy heavy ion collisions @xcite , we expect that they could affect the analysis based on transport models .",
    "the use of spectral functions in the description of correlated nucleons goes beyond the quasi - particle picture customarily used in transport codes .",
    "although some results point out the fact that off - shell effects in the propagation of nucleons are small @xcite , a treatment of a kinetic equation including full spectral functions obtained from realistic nn potentials ( following , for instance , @xcite or @xcite ) is , to our knowledge , still lacking . moreover , even within the usual quasi - particle description , some of the in - medium modifications of nucleons ( such as effective masses or nn cross - sections ) are taken as simple parameterizations @xcite .",
    "our model permits the calculations of these quantities from realistic nn potentials in a fully microscopical and td consistent basis which , properly parameterized , could be used in this kind of studies .",
    "the ladder or @xmath0-matrix approximation of the scgf method is a @xmath86 derivable approach and thus theoretically it should fulfil td consistency .",
    "we have checked the numerical td consistency of this approach for symmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature by computing an approximation to the entropy , the dynamical quasi - particle entropy , @xmath117 , which has been discussed by carneiro and pethick @xcite . using this @xmath117 approximation we obtain a good agreement between the chemical potentials determined within the scgf calculation and the corresponding values derived from the thermodynamical relations .",
    "therefore , the ladder approximation of the scgf approach supplemented by the evaluation of the entropy @xmath117 provides a method of calculating thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter , which accounts for correlations beyond the mean field picture in a consistent way .",
    "the entropy , @xmath117 , can be evaluated in terms of a weighting function @xmath136 , which is connected to the usual single - particle spectral function @xmath63 of the scgf .",
    "this means that @xmath136 can be calculated in term of the nucleon self - energy and an explicit evaluation of the generating functional @xmath86 can be avoided . the @xmath136 spectral function and its momentum , energy , density and temperature dependences",
    "have been studied . in general",
    ", one can say that this function exhibits a more pronounced quasi - particle structure than the corresponding spectral function @xmath63 . as a consequence ,",
    "the correlation effects related to the broadening of the quasi - particle peak are not very important and a quasi - particle approximation to the evaluation of the entropy is a very good approximation if the quasi - particle energies are derived from the scgf self - energy . even if the quasi - particle energies are approximated by the single - particle energies derived from the temperature dependent bhf approximation , the values for the calculated entropy deviate only by as much as 10 to 20 percent .",
    "in contrast to the scgf , however , the bhf approximation fails to fulfil thermodynamic consistency .",
