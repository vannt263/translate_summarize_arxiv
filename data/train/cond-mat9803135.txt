    "several different scenarios have been proposed @xcite to explain the unusual phase diagram of the heavy fermion superconductor @xmath0 in an external magnetic field @xcite and under pressure .",
    "@xcite this phase diagram consists of several superconducting phases of presumably different symmetry .",
    "almost all theories of the phase diagram involve unconventional superconductivity , i.e. superconducting order parameters of lower symmetry than the conventional one which only breaks the u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "these scenarios have almost exclusively been discussed on the basis of generalized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theories of superconductivity , where the free energy functional is derived purely by symmetry arguments . @xcite it is the nature of this approach that such theories require a considerable number of adjustable phenomenological parameters .",
    "in addition the choice of the order parameter , which can be classified according to the irreducible representations of the normal state symmetry group of the system , is open .",
    "each representation corresponds to a cooper pairing channel with a particular pairing energy , i.e. transition temperature .    at present , no satisfactory microscopic theory exists which could assist in picking out the relevant representation and fixing the phenomenological parameters of the corresponding gl theory .",
    "of course , it is possible to work based on semimicroscopic formulation of a generalized weak - coupling bcs theory .",
    "this type of approach is often used in the study of properties related to the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle excitations for unconventional superconducting states with a specific topology of nodal structure of the quasiparticle gap , and considerable insight for various low - temperature properties has been gained from these treatments .",
    "@xcite however , they are insufficient to answer the open questions we have in determining a gl theory .",
    "one difficulty arises from the fact that the specific form of the attractive pairing potential is unknown .",
    "various additional corrections to the simplified weak - coupling treatment might be important and need to be properly taken into account .",
    "one aspect is the shape of the fermi surface , ( fs ) which has multiple sheets , some of them very anisotropic .",
    "@xcite in conventional weak - coupling calculations the fs has usually a spherical symmetry .",
    "it would be helpful to connect the semimicroscopic and the gl approach by including effects of the fs anisotropy into the weak - coupling approach .",
    "such effects are an important part in determining the symmetry of the relevant cooper pairing channel as well as the values of the parameters in the gl theory , and have so far not been considered in the literature .",
    "let us now briefly review the situation in the theory of @xmath2 .",
    "the scenarios for the @xmath2-phase diagram can be divided into three classes .",
    "( 1 ) the relevant order parameter belongs to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) representation of the crystal point group symmetry @xmath3 ( hexagonal ) of @xmath0 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite in this scenario a symmetry lowering field is required to lift the two - fold degeneracy of the 2d order parameter in order to describe the experimentally observed double transition .",
    "such a field is given , for example , by the staggered moment of the weak antiferromagnetic order which appears below @xmath6 in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite to this class of theories belongs in spirit an idea due to zhitomirskii and lukyanchuk , @xcite which states that the system is actually close to an isotropic one .",
    "hexagonal anisotropy is then taken to split the representations of the rotation group , leaving nearly degenerate 1d or 2d representations .",
    "( 2 ) the double transition can also occur for a triplet order parameter described by the one - dimensional ( 1d ) representations of @xmath1 group , when the spin - orbit coupling interaction is negligible .",
    "in this model the degeneracy due to the spin direction is lifted by the staggered magnetic moment .",
    "@xcite ( 3 ) it is also plausible , that two irreducible representations of @xmath3 might have their transition temperatures very close to each other ( accidental near degeneracy ) such that they would generate the feature of the double transtion . @xcite the staggered moment does not play any role in this type of scenario .    as a test case for these scenarios usually the tetracritical point in the @xmath7-@xmath8-phase diagram of @xmath2 at @xmath9 is analyzed .",
    "this point is most clearly observed for fields parallel to the basal plane , and is rather insensitive to the relative orientation with respect to the basal plane crystalline axes .",
    "the scenarios ( 1 ) have , in general , more difficulty than the scenarios ( 3 ) to reproduce this detail because of the anisotropy introduced by the staggered moment .",
    "one argument to overcome this flaw is the assumption that the staggered moment always follows the orientation of the applied magnetic field .",
    "a further problem for the type 1 ) theories is that the observed tetracritical point for fields along the c - axis is not well reproduced .",
    "sauls suggests that the problem could also be solved if certain parameters in the gl theory are very small .",
    "@xcite based on this idea he gave an argument in favor of the irreducible representation @xmath10 ( f - wave ) which is a triplet pairing state .",
    "joynt@xcite argues similarly that in an @xmath11 representation an apparent tetracritical point for @xmath12 is obtained if the system is nearly particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the data for this configuration are not conclusive.@xcite the scenarios ( 2 ) of the order parameter given by 1d representations and ( 3 ) which neglects the coupling between the staggered moment and the superconducting order parameter predict a tetracritical point in all directions .",
    "strong evidence in favor of theories ( types 1 ) & 2 ) ) which rely on the antiferromagnetic order as a symmetry breaking field is the observed simultaneous disappearance of both the high temperature , low field  a phase \" and the staggered moment with the application of hydrostatic pressure.@xcite the disappearance of the two transitions could be taken as evidence for the zhitomirskii - lukyanchuk scenario , suggesting a nearness to  isotropy \" .",
    "however the simultaneous vanishing of the staggered magnetization seems more natural in the context of the 2d theories based on a symmetry breaking field .",
    "more recently , it was found that at the pressure value where the transitions merge , application of basal plane stress  resplit \" the transition , lending further support to these scenarios.@xcite on the other hand , in these theories the staggered magnetization generally must be assumed to rotate with the applied field in order to understand both the isotropy of the phase diagram for @xmath13 and the weak sixfold variation of the upper critical field @xmath14 with angle in the plane.@xcite the recent experiment of lussier et al . which found no rotation of the staggered moment with field appears to contradict this hypothesis , however.@xcite    further constraints on the theory are provided by recent knight shift measurements , which show no temperature dependence for any direction of the field below @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite this striking result would be consistent with an equal spin pairing state such as in @xmath16 , with cooper pair spins free to rotate with the external field .",
    "such a model ( type 3 ) , in which the order parameter is a spin triplet state with 3 spin components split by the staggered moment , has indeed been proposed by machida and co - workers.@xcite this theory has the disadvantage of generically exhibiting three transitions in zero field rather than two , due to the three independent order parameter components .",
    "it also can not explain the apparent pauli limiting of the upper critical field for @xmath12.@xcite    thus , the existing experimental data have not been particularly kind to any of the current theoretical scenarios .",
    "it is not our aim to identify the correct theory here .",
    "rather , we focus on an aspect which has been generally neglected in oversimplified models , namely which types of order parameter might be favored by the unusual , highly anisotropic fermi surface of @xmath17 . within an extension of the semimicroscopic weak - coupling theory , we hope to be able to suggest which scenario is most likely , although no concrete proof can be given . from our analysis",
    "we expect to answer or shed light on some of the questions of interest .",
    "are two nearly degenerate order parameters very likely to appear in @xmath2 ? does the scenario ( 1 ) given by sauls satisfy the conditions that gl theory would produce the isotropic tetracritical point ? is the system close to  isotropy \" in the sense of zhitomirskii and lukyanchuk ?",
    "which representations are favored by hexagonal anisotropy ? and , how is the pairing potential distributed among the various sheets of the multisheeted fermi surface ?",
    "our discussion is considerably simplified by the assumption that a weak - coupling type of theory can be applied in case of @xmath2 .",
    "several properties of @xmath2 support the validity of such an approach .",
    "first , @xmath2 ( in contrast to @xmath18 ) is in a rather well - developed fermi liquid ( fl ) regime at the onset of superconductivity .",
    "for example , the linear specific heat and the @xmath19-dependence of the resistivity are suggestive for the existence of well - defined ( landau ) quasiparticles .",
    "@xcite their effective mass is extremely large such that the degeneracy temperature @xmath20 is of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "the question arises whether strong coupling effects are important in such a situation .",
    "they are measured by the ratio @xmath22 which is here of the order of 1/20 .",
    "thus we neglect these corrections , although they are considerably stronger than in conventional superconductors with @xmath23 . indirect justification for this assumption",
    "is provided by the size of the specific heat discontinuity at the upper transition point , @xmath24 , @xcite which has to be compared with the bcs weak - coupling result , @xmath25 .",
    "the fl renormalizations are of course quite large , as evidenced by the large effective mass .",
    "however , we will focus our attention to the properties of the superconductor close to the transition temperature , where these corrections are irrelevant .",
    "@xcite furthermore we simplify our discussion by taking the pairing potential as the only interaction among the quasiparticles into account . thus the only modification to the usual weak - coupling theories is inclusion of the fermi surface anisotropy .",
    "this implies also that pair correlation can be confined to a narrow energy shell about the fs of a width @xmath26 , the cutoff energy associated with the electron - electron interaction ( analogous to the debye frequency @xmath27 in conventional superconductors ) .",
    "the bcs description of the superconductor is based on the following typical hamiltonian    @xmath28    where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a quasiparticle with momentum @xmath31 and spin @xmath32 .",
    "the quasiparticle band @xmath33 is measured relative to the fermi energy @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the pairing potential which is finite only for momenta @xmath31 and @xmath36 for which @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where only scattering processes between particles of opposite momentum are included .",
    "the superconducting state is expressed by the mean field    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the thermal expectation value .",
    "the mean field @xmath41 describes the gap of the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath42^{1/2 } $ ] .",
    "the gap function @xmath43 is a @xmath44-matrix in spin space . by inserting the expectation value for a given temperature @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) we obtain the self - consistency equation for the gap function ,    @xmath46    this equation can be used to determine @xmath47 by considering the limit of the order parameter amplitude @xmath48 which yields the linearized gap equation    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is obtained by integrating @xmath51 over @xmath52 in the energy shell , @xmath53 .",
    "this equation is an eigenvalue equation where the largest among the eigenvalues @xmath54 determines the superconducting transition temperature @xmath47 and the corresponding symmetry of gap function .",
    "the cooper pairing states can be classified into even ( spin singlet ) and odd ( spin triplet ) parity states which can be parametrized by a scalar function    @xmath55    for even parity and a vector function    @xmath56    for odd parity .",
    "if we assume that in the scattering described by @xmath57 spins are not affected then the pairing potential has the following form    @xmath58    where the @xmath59 ( @xmath60)-sign occurs for @xmath57 supporting odd ( even ) parity pairing . in this case the linearized gap equation can be expressed in the new parametrization as    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    note that in the case of odd parity pairing the different components of @xmath63 do not mix in the linearized gap equation .      in our weak - coupling approach",
    "we ignored quasiparticles further away from the fs so that in the linearized gap equation given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) the momentum sum is restricted to the fermi surface . in this case",
    "we express the gap function in terms of the linear combinations of the spherical harmonics defined on an appropriate fermi surface .",
    "it is however necessary to choose this set of polynomials @xmath64 so that they are orthonormal to each other in the sense that the scalar product is determined as a fs average    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a label for the polynomial .",
    "this property is most easily achieved by classifying them with respect to the irreducible representations of the crystal field point group , @xmath3 in our case .",
    "then only the polynomials within each irreducible representation have to be orthogonalized .",
    "the gap function for the singlet state can now be written as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 are the complex expansion coefficients .",
    "for the triplet state we have to express the vector @xmath69 which requires an additional set of polynomials @xmath70 which leads to    @xmath71    orthogonality in this case is defined by    @xmath72    in tabs .",
    "i - iii we catalogue these polynomials up to the order 3 . we can now use them to express the linearized gap equation in matrix form as we show here for the case of even parity    @xmath73    where    @xmath74    clearly , this eigenvalue equation decays into block form where each block belongs to one irreducible representation of @xmath3 .",
    "thus we may consider the problem for each representation separately .",
    "there are representations in tabs .",
    "i and iii which have more than one polynomial .",
    "it is necessary to include all of them and ensure that they are orthonormalized .",
    "note that the orthonormalization depends on the properties of the fs .",
    "sometimes it is advantageous to express the gap function in terms of so - called fs harmonics , as introduced by butler and allen,@xcite and discussed in the context of the @xmath17 pairing problem in ref .",
    "the fermi surface harmonics are homogeneous polynomials of the fermi velocity , @xmath75 and in the case of @xmath1 point group they can be obtained from tabs .",
    "i - iii by replacing @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) by @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "these functions are to be orthonormalized in the same way as the polynomials constructed from spherical harmonics .",
    "we will use the fs harmonic representation of the order parameter in section 3 of this paper .",
    "now we have to specify the pairing interaction @xmath80 and the electron band @xmath81 . in a spherical symmetric system the pairing states would be classified according to their angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( and radial quantum numbers among which we will consider here only the lowest ones in each angular momentum channel ) .",
    "states for a given @xmath82 are degenerate , i.e. yield in the linearized gap equation above the same transition temperature @xmath47 .",
    "it is natural then to write the corresponding pair potential as    @xmath84\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 are the spherical harmonics depending on the fermi vectors @xmath76 .",
    "note that the @xmath86 are dimensionless but are different from the usual @xmath87 away from the isotropic fermi surface point .",
    "in this notation @xmath88 is negative for an attractive potential . in the following",
    "we will consider the fs anisotropy ( crystal field ) effects on the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "the information we can obtain is how the degenerate eigenstates evolve as the fs gradually becomes anisotropic .",
    "we will keep the interaction in this form where @xmath89 is an unknown parameter .",
    "information from experimental data as well as band structure calculation can help us to obtain an approximate electron band @xmath81 . while the fs of @xmath2 is highly complex and consists of at least five sheets , @xcite not all of them are equally important .",
    "we will focus here on two bands only which are supposed to be the ones with the largest and the third - largest contribution to the density of states , that is the @xmath90 and @xmath91 fs sheet respectively ( notation from ref . 16 ) .",
    "a simple but crude fit of the band structure data can be achieved by the following form for @xmath81    @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath34 are fit parameters .",
    "the @xmath91 band is fitted by an ellipsoidal @xmath81 which is rotationally symmetric about the c - axis , that is @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) . the hexagonal anisotropy is larger for the @xmath90 band which we approximate by a `` wrinkled '' ellipsoid with @xmath95 .",
    "note , that the latter band has additional pockets at brioullin zone boundary which are not reproduced by @xmath81 from eq .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) . however , this form of @xmath81 has the advantage that we can follow continuously the development of the anisotropic bands starting from a spherical symmetric one ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters in @xmath81 for the anisotropic band are obtained using the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 from lda calculations @xcite and by conserving the area of cross section in the @xmath100-@xmath101 plane as observed in de haas - van alphen measurements . @xcite",
    "our best fit parameters are given in tab .",
    "iv , and the fs cross sections by the symmetry planes are shown in fig .",
    "this fit leaves still the density of states integrated over the fs as an undetermined parameter . in the following",
    "we will express various quantities in dimensionless units refering to the integrated density of states .",
    "we address now the problem of the stability of the possible pairing states in the given @xmath91- and @xmath90-band . in reality",
    ", superconductivity is a combined effect of all fs sheets , because quasiparticle scattering among the different sheets will couple their pairing amplitudes .",
    "it would be not difficult to introduce such interband coupling in the pairing interaction @xmath102 , but this would lead to additional unknown coupling parameters . in the following discussion",
    "we will avoid this complication and consider the effect of the two fs sheets separately as if they were uncoupled .",
    "we investigate the effect of the fs anisotropy on the pairing states by continuously distorting a spherical fs into the above defined fs sheets @xmath91 or @xmath90 ( eq . ( [ e16 ] ) ) . for the spherical fs",
    "all pairing states of the same angular momentum @xmath82 are degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy of these @xmath103 states is lifted when the fs deviates from the spherical shape , and they can be classified by the irreducible representations of the new , lower symmetry @xmath3 . restricting our attention to only one value of @xmath82 ( @xmath104 and 3 ) at a time we need only to take one coupling parameter , @xmath89 , into account .",
    "this assumption may be too simplistic for realistic pair potentials , but we make it in the first analysis to isolate the effects of the fermi surface anisotropy .",
    "we use an eigenvalue @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ e3a ] ) on the spherical fs of the same integrated density of states , @xmath106 , as a reference value for @xmath107 . expressed in dimensionless units",
    "@xmath108 does not depend on @xmath106 , which is not determined within this approach . the distortion from a spherical fs that is the effect of a crystal field",
    "is included by the dimensionless linear parameter @xmath109 changing from 0 to 1 , with @xmath110 corresponding to the spherical fermi surface of the radius adjusted to dhva data @xcite and @xmath111 representing @xmath112 or @xmath113 fermi sheet ( tab .",
    "therefore an increase in @xmath109 implies a higher hexagonal ( @xmath112 ) or ellipsoidal ( @xmath113 ) perturbation of the fermi surface .",
    "the @xmath109-dependence of the energy band coefficients for the hexagonal fs is given by    @xmath114    and for the ellipsoidal fermi sheet    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the z - axis lattice constant ( tab .",
    "the solutions of the linearized gap equation ( eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) for the p - wave , d - wave and f - wave pair potentials as the functions of the crystal field @xmath109 are shown in fig . 2 for the case of pairing interaction on @xmath117 fermi sheet only ( hexagonal crystal field ) and fig . 3 for the case of pairing potential on @xmath118 fermi sheet ( ellipsoidal crystal field ) .",
    "we present the critical temperature @xmath15 for triplet states ( figs .",
    "2a,2c,3a,3c ) with @xmath119 ( eq . ( [ e5 ] ) ) only as the states with @xmath120 are degenerate with them according to tabs .",
    "i and iii .",
    "particularly interesting is the result for the d - wave states with the pairing interaction on @xmath112 fs ( fig .",
    "we observe here a competition between @xmath121 and @xmath11 states as the hexagonal anisotropy of the fermi sheet is increased",
    ". finally , for our best fit @xmath112 fs ( @xmath111 ) the transition temperature of @xmath121 state ( @xmath122 ) is higher than that of @xmath11 state ( @xmath123 ) , but the system is very close to the degeneracy point ( @xmath124 ) where @xmath125 .",
    "thus application of a hydrodynamic pressure which decreases the crystal field @xmath109 and restores `` isotropy '' may drive the system to a state with a single transition temperature @xmath126 , consistent with the zhitomirskii and lukyanchuk scenario .",
    "@xcite the role of the hexagonal crystal field is worth mentioning , since as we show in fig .",
    "3b the cylindrical crystal field lifts the spherical fs ( @xmath110 ) degeneracy of d - wave states and splits the transition temperatures corresponding to different irreducible representations .",
    "therefore the situation of near degenerate states @xmath121 and @xmath11 is not realized when the pairing mainly takes place on the ellipsoidal @xmath113 fs .",
    "analysis of the f - wave states shows that the @xmath10 irreducible representation , suggested to describe the superconducting state in sauls scenario , @xcite is the one with the highest transition temperature on @xmath117 fs but almost degenerate with @xmath127 representation ( fig .",
    "2c ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition temperature of @xmath127 state is significantly higher than that of @xmath10 on the @xmath118 sheet of fs ( fig .",
    "direct calculation of the gl coefficients incorporating aspects of the anisotropy of the fs is important for several reasons .",
    "the question of most current interest is the consistency of the sauls @xmath10 scenario for the @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "@xcite this theory relies on the smallness of a particular term in the gl gradient free energy , which may be shown to destroy the isotropy of the tetracritical point in the 2d scenario . in the particular case of the @xmath10 representation",
    ", this term may be shown to vanish in cylindrical symmetry , and it is therefore hexagonal anisotropy alone which is responsible for the disagreement between the predictions of the @xmath10 scenario for the phase diagram and experiment . if the effect of the anisotropy could be shown to be quite small , i.e. the system were in this sense quite close to a cylindrically symmetric one , one would have considerably more confidence in the theory .    before discussing this point in some detail , we remark however that other important physical information can be gleaned from a weak coupling calculation of the gl coefficients over the fs .",
    "experimentally measurable quantities at the transition depend directly on combinations of the gl coefficients , e.g. for the specific heat jump , @xmath128 .",
    "if sufficient independent measurements can be made to pin down the coefficients individually , and if the correct representation is known , comparison with weak - coupling calculations including the correct fermi surface could in principle allow one to determine the size of strong - coupling corrections .",
    "this might in turn serve as a guide for theories of the @xmath0 normal state .",
    "the form of the gl free energy density has been given in several places , e.g. refs .",
    "for the 2d representations in hexagonal symmetry it takes the form @xmath129    with the order parameter given by the 2d vector    @xmath130    that is for    @xmath131    in the case of even parity ( eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) ) and    @xmath132    for an odd parity ( eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) ) , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the polynomials listed in tabs .",
    "i - iii . in the spin - triplet states",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath135 vector is real and oriented along the crystal direction @xmath136 ( @xmath137-axis ) by strong spin - orbit coupling in accordance with sauls scenario .",
    "@xcite this conjecture leads to the identical forms of the gl functionals for both even and odd states .",
    "@xcite    expressions for the gl coefficients are straightforward to obtain through expansion of the luttinger - ward functional for the bcs superconductor in powers of the order parameter , and identification of the prefactors of the various invariants present in the phenomenological form in eq .",
    "one finds for the case of even parity    @xmath138    where it is to be understood that , @xmath139 , and the constants are given by    @xmath140    for odd parity these expression are analogous where we have to take into account that a product @xmath141 is replaced by a scalar product @xmath142 .",
    "knowledge of the fermi surface and of the basis functions for the various representations now allows one to evaluate , in principle , all coefficients of interest ( eq .",
    "( [ e20 ] ) ) .",
    "there are several hidden problems in this analysis .",
    "the most serious has been alluded to above , namely our lack of knowledge of the relative pairing weight on each of the sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "as before , we approach this difficulty by assuming that pairing takes place either on the @xmath117 or the @xmath118 sheets of the fermi surface , and discuss both cases separately .",
    "the second has to do with the choice of basis functions .",
    "we compare two different methods and calculate the coefficients for the expansion of the order parameter in the spherical harmonics and in the fs harmonics .",
    "another complication arises from an infinite number of functions belonging to each irreducible representation in a crystal .",
    "thus our choice of the @xmath143 and @xmath144 is perforce somewhat arbitrary . in this work we generally work with the lowest order polynomial functions for each representation .",
    "we can test to see whether the choice of higher order polynomials will greatly alter the size of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ e20 ] ) ( it does not ) , but a more quantitative approach would allow the order parameter @xmath145 to adjust to the given angle - resolved density of states by taking a general linear combination of many such functions .",
    "this would have , for the fs harmonic representation particularly , the virtue of allowing for smoothing of singularities which inevitably result from the rapid changes of @xmath146 over a complicated fermi surface . working with a single function @xmath147 and @xmath148 is sufficient for our purposes , however , since the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ e20 ] ) are always integrated over the full fs under consideration , and only the degree of hexagonal anisotropy should be important .    a special role in the topology of the @xmath149 phase diagram of the the 2d representations is played by the coefficient @xmath150 ( eqs .",
    "( [ e17 ] ) , ( [ e20 ] ) ) which mixes the gradients of the two components of the order parameter .",
    "the solution of the eigenvalue problem determining the critical field lines in the @xmath149 plane is analogous to a schdinger equation for a charge moving in a magnetic field .",
    "the existence of a tetracritical point has been shown therefore to correspond to a level crossing , which can not exist in the absence of a conserved quantum number .",
    "the @xmath150 mixing terms correspond to a level repulsion ( or hybridisation ) term in this analogy , and thus prevent a crossing of the critical field lines for @xmath151 .    by examining table iii , it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( 22 ) that the coefficient @xmath150 in a cylindrically symmetric system , where @xmath152 , vanishes for @xmath10 symmetry whereas for the @xmath153 representations , @xmath154 is of @xmath155 .",
    "similarly it is easy to check that @xmath156 is of @xmath155 for both representations .",
    "sauls argument @xcite is therefore that if hexagonal anisotropy effects are weak @xmath157 , the critical fields may come so close as to mimic an apparent tetracritical point , even for @xmath151 . to test this proposition , it is interesting to know not simply whether @xmath150 is in fact much smaller than @xmath158 when evaluated over the @xmath0 fermi surface , but whether or not this result is `` accidental '' or due to the near cylindrical symmetry of the fermi surface . is the change in @xmath150 due to hexagonal anisotropy in fact small ?",
    "sauls proposes that it is , and gives a perturbative analysis for a band structure of type given by eq .",

    "because of the cylindrical symmetry of @xmath118 fs , the @xmath150 coefficient calculated over this fs sheet vanishes .",
    "we have tried to take crude features of the @xmath17 fermi surface into account within a weak - coupling theory of unconventional superconductivity to see which order parameter symmetries are favored by fermi surface structure alone . in the current philosophy , these are classified according to their angular momentum quantum numbers in the fictitious spherical system obtained when the ellipsoidal and hexagonal deformations of the  true \" fermi surface are  turned off \" . within this scheme",
    ", we have examined states of @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , and @xmath166 symmetry .",
    "other important elements of the physics , such as the actual nature of the spin - orbit coupling and the range of the pairing , may also play major roles , but have been neglected here .",
    "the lack of knowledge of a microscopic pairing mechanism  and consequent inability to specify the relative pairing weights on the various fermi surface sheets  prevents us from drawing firm conclusions from an analysis of this type , but our results are suggestive .",
    ".2 cm it is worth observing that the few representations we have found to be stabilized by fermi surface anisotropy are precisely those under active consideration as candidates for the @xmath17 order parameter : the two - dimensional representations @xmath11 and @xmath10 and the 1d representations @xmath127 and @xmath121 .",
    "both of the 1d representations found are of interest in the accidentally degenerate representation scenario of garg and co - workers,@xcite which requires , however , mixing of nearly degenerate @xmath167-type and @xmath168-type representations .",
    "all of the latter are disfavored by the fermi surface deformations we consider ; our results do not therefore lend support to this model . the trivial representation",
    "@xmath121 corresponds to basis functions with the full symmetry of the fermi surface , which typically are fully gapped .",
    "such functions will be strongly supressed by local coulomb interactions , which we do not consider here ; they are by themselves ruled out by experiment .",
    "exceptions occur if the system condenses in an @xmath121 state with nodes , or mixes with another representation supporting basis functions with nodes , as in the zhitomirskii- lukyanchuk scenario.@xcite the near degeneracy found in figure 2b ) for the @xmath121 and @xmath11 states for @xmath169 , which is very close to the best fit to the @xmath117 fermi surface sheet ( @xmath111 ) , is some support for this picture .",
    ".2 cm we have attempted to account for our ignorance of the true distribution of the pair weights over the various fermi surface sheets by examining models with pairing on the two sheets with highest density of states according to de haas - van alphen measurements , namely @xmath118 and @xmath117 . as @xmath118 is nearly ellipsoidal but @xmath117 has strong hexagonal deformations , this choice has the additional virtue of crudely separating hexagonal and ellipsoidal variations .",
    "this may be of significance for current theories : for example , the hexagonal deformation appears to be important in stabilizing the @xmath10 representation .",
    "confirmation of the @xmath10 model would therefore be indirect evidence for pairing primarily on the @xmath117 sheet .",
    "such conclusions could be used as guides for microscopic pairing theories .",
    ".2 cm the scenario based on the @xmath10 representation due to sauls@xcite is based on the assumption that the level repulsion term in the schrdinger - like equation for the critical field lines vanishes due to the proximity of the system to cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this term is proportional to the ratio of gl gradient coefficients @xmath170,@xcite which vanishes in this limit for the @xmath10 state .",
    "we have calculated these coefficients over our model fermi surfaces fit to lda calculations and dhva measurements , and find that this term is not small , but varies between .21 and .53 , depending on our assumptions regarding the exact form of the basis functions . while the parametrization of the fermi surface we have adopted is extremely simplistic , it has the virtue that one can discuss the proximity to cylindrical symmetry .",
    "what figure 4 suggests is that the @xmath17 system may not really be regarded as close to cylindrically symmetric , and that therefore if calculations of the gl coefficients over the true fermi surface produce a smaller value,@xcite it should be regarded as coincidence .",
    "this undermines somewhat the attractiveness of the sauls @xmath10 scenario , but of course does not constitute proof against it .",
    "one way in which this conclusion could be avoided is to have contributions to @xmath150 which change sign on different fermi surface sheets , leading to a smaller effective @xmath150 .",
    "this effect is indeed found in a calculation with the full @xmath17 lda fermi surface and a model with weight distributed equally over all sheets.@xcite .2 cm",
