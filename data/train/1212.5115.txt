    "to generalize the qubit scheme to a method that is able to teleport superpositions of multiple basis states , we have to identify a photonic system with a unique antisymmetric state and a linear optical device that plays the role of the beam splitter in the qubit case , i.e. a filter for antisymmetric states .",
    "the uniqueness is required to guarantee that the filter yields the same state @xmath24 that is initially shared by alice and bob , i.e. the state @xmath25 .",
    "the dimension of the space spanned by the antisymmetric states of composite systems ( only if the dimension equals @xmath26 do we have a unique antisymmetric state ! ) can be easily determined by means of young tableaux ( see methods ) .",
    "it turns out that only @xmath0 systems each with @xmath0 levels posses a unique antisymmetric state . as a consequence",
    ", a generalization of the teleportation scheme for photonic qubits by means of a bell filter for antisymmetric states requires @xmath0 photons propagating on different paths each with a quantized degree of freedom , such as oam with @xmath0-levels . in other words ,",
    "the generalization requires @xmath0 qudits .",
    "photonic states can be conveniently expressed by means of creation operators @xmath27 acting on the vacuum state @xmath28 . in our case",
    "these operators carry two indices  the first one , @xmath29 , specifies one of @xmath0 possible propagation paths whereas the second one , @xmath30 , denotes the oam value @xmath31 of the photon .",
    "for example , the state @xmath32 of two photons propagating on different paths with two oam values @xmath33  which is the oam analog of the antisymmetric polarization state used in qubit teleportation @xcite  can be written by means of a determinant of creation operators : @xmath34 it is obvious that the state @xmath35 is antisymmetric , since under permutation of the propagation paths it is transferred to @xmath36 .",
    "the antisymmetry is represented by the determinant : a swap of rows corresponding to the permutation results in a minus sign of the determinant .",
    "using the same logic , one can show that the antisymmetric state of @xmath0 photons with @xmath0 oam values can be expressed by the determinant of a @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 here @xmath18 is the required antisymmetric state .",
    "the antisymmetry follows from the fact that permutation of any two propagation directions corresponding to a swap of two rows of the determinant in eq .",

    "s photons must be already in an antisymmetric state before the projection . to take care of the change of sign of oam values upon reflection at the beam splitters , the oam values carried by the light in the horizontal path must have opposite sign to those in the vertical paths.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]    for teleportation the @xmath0 photons in the antisymmetric state given in eq .",
    "( [ antisym ] ) must be divided between alice ( @xmath42 photons ) and bob ( @xmath43 photons ) such that both share a bipartite maximally entangled state . to check for maximal entanglement",
    "we take advantage of the representation of @xmath18 in terms of a determinant . expanding the determinant with respect to the first row",
    ", we obtain the state : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the @xmath47 submatrix obtained by omitting the @xmath48-th column and the first row ( a so - called minor of @xmath38 ) and @xmath49 .",
    "it is remarkable that the expansion of the determinant results in a maximally entangled bipartite state of the form ( [ psi ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , implying that alice and bob obtain @xmath41 and one photon , respectively .",
    "this partitioning of photons allows alice to teleport any state of a single @xmath0-level photon from charlie by sending it along with her @xmath41 photons into the beam splitter array depicted in fig .",
    "[ multi - bs ] and subsequently obtaining a coincidence count in all its output ports .",
    "the coincidence count results effectively in a projection into the antisymmetric state @xmath18 as can be checked for any finite dimension @xmath0 by direct calculation . on the other hand , the antisymmetric state entering the beam splitter array yields , with certainty , a coincidence count ( cp .",
    "methods ) .",
    "but this is not the only possible partitioning of photons that leads to a maximally entangled state between alice and bob .",
    "strikingly , any partition @xmath52 with @xmath53 of an antisymmetric state of @xmath0 particles possesses this property , and this can be easily understood by virtue of the rules to calculate determinants ( see methods ) . for the partition @xmath52",
    "one obtains a bipartite state as given in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) with @xmath54 and @xmath55 as well as @xmath56 given in terms of minors of @xmath38 .",
    "the maximum amount of quantum information is teleported with a @xmath57 partition of an even number @xmath0 of photons prepared in state @xmath18 . in this case charlie",
    "has to provide @xmath1 photons , cp .",
    "[ fig-03 ] , and can send for large @xmath0 approximately @xmath0 qubits , simultaneously ( cp .",

    "this information is encoded in the @xmath58 dimensional , anti - symmetric subspace spanned by the @xmath56 .",
    "this is an exponential gain compared to the teleportation of a single qudit ( corresponding to @xmath59 qubits ) carried by one photon , which requires the same entanglement resource  an antisymmetric state of @xmath0 photons @xmath18 .",
    "( note that charlie s photons must be in an antisymmetric state to guarantee that the beam splitter array acts as a bell filter in case of a coincidence count in its output ports .",
    "a general bell filter for @xmath42 photons from alice and @xmath43 photons from charlie in antisymmetric states can be constructed by the recursive use of the bell filter depicted in fig .",

    "an example of a bell - filter without heralding techniques for qutrits is discussed together with the preparation of a totally antisymmetric state in methods . ) .",
    "let us emphasize that this method thus constitutes a simultaneous teleportation of the collective state of several photons .     of @xmath43 photons ( number of photons indicated).,width=283 ]",
    "in comparison , teleporting @xmath0 qubits individually , one requires the same number of maximally entangled photon pairs , i.e. a total of @xmath60 additional photons , resulting in an efficiency of sending half a qubit per additional photon or @xmath61 of a qubit per photon generated .",
    "our scheme yields double these rates and thus requires half the number of photons ( cp fig .  ) to teleport the same amount of quantum information .",
    "this is an important improvement since the number of photons , that can be generated per time - unit is the limiting factor for the bandwidth of photonic quantum communication .",
    "however , it holds only for the selective regime conditioned on successful teleportation events . on average",
    "the number of photons increases by a factor @xmath62 with the number @xmath63 of outcomes of a bell measurement of @xmath0 qudit photons . since it might be possible to create bell filters by means of linear optics for half of the bell states ( cp .",
    "@xcite ) instead of a single filter as in our case , this would mean an increase of only a factor @xmath64 .",
    "this is a promising subject for future research since for individual qubit teleportation with linear optics the success probability is limited by @xmath65 , resulting in a relative exponential overhead .    in the foregoing presentation of results we assumed the existence of a source @xmath66 that produces the state @xmath18 initially shared by alice and bob ( cp .",
    "challenge ( i ) ) which is treated in the methods .",
    "indeed for qutrits , such a source can be realized by an additional beam splitter array with two beam splitters ( cp .",
    "[ multi - bs ] for @xmath4 ) , that acts as a bell - filter for the antisymmetric state @xmath18 . for this purpose",
    "a single photon together with an antisymmetric state of two photons must enter the array and one photon must leave each of its output ports . in the general case nondestructive heralding techniques based on non - linear optical effects @xcite might be employed in conjunction with photonic multiports , which however reduce the efficiency of the teleportation scheme .",
    "these methods will be discussed elsewhere .    apart from an additional overhead of photonic resources needed if filtering techniques are used to prepare the antisymmetric state ( cp .",
    "first paragraph in this section ) there is the need to produce simultaneously the number of photons required for the entangled state and the state that carries the quantum information to be teleported .",
    "if the photons are generated by single photon sources , the success probabilities for the single photons will multiply and lead to an exponential decrease of the total success probability .",
    "this is a serious problem , however , it is also encountered when qubits in an unknown state that can not be resent are to be teleported individually . to solve this problem",
    "one requires techniques investigated for long distance quantum communication and require to store the required number of photons in quantum memories and release them collectively to produce the entangled states needed for the teleportation of complex states .",
    "* dimension of the antisymmetric subspace * + the dimension of an antisymmetric subspace can be calculated using combinatorial objects called young tableaux , which provide a technique of keeping track of the constraints imposed by the permutation symmetry of the system . here",

    "a basis of the symmetric combinations of two systems can be depicted by a row of two boxes , @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , a basis of anti - symmetric states is represented by a column of boxes , @xmath70 .",
    "since we are interested only in the antisymmetric part , we focus on columns only .",
    "the dimension of the corresponding subspace , i.e. the number of basis states , is obtained by counting the different possible ways to fill the boxes with numbers according to certain rules . for the antisymmetric subspace we start filling the numbers in descending order , from top to bottom . for a system",
    "that consists of two subsystems , a young tableaux reads : @xmath71 where @xmath68 is always greater than @xmath72 . therefore ,",
    "if the total number of basis states available for each subsystem is two , i.e. we are dealing with two qubits , there is only one possibility , namely @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as a result",
    ", we obtain an antisymmetric subspace of dimension one .",
    "if the available states are more than two , say @xmath0 , then we have @xmath41 options for @xmath68 and given @xmath68 , @xmath75 options for @xmath72 . as a result the total number of combinations is given by @xmath76 , which is the dimension of the antisymmetric subspace for a pair of @xmath0-level systems , each of which can carry one qudit of quantum information .",

    "<S> we show how to teleport a `` qudit '' , i.e. a superposition of an arbitrary number @xmath0 of distinguishable states present in the orbital angular momentum of a single photon using @xmath0 beam splitters and @xmath0 additional entangled photons . </S>",
    "<S> the same entanglement resource might also be employed to collectively teleport the state of @xmath1 photons at the cost of one additional entangled photon per qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this is superior to existing schemes for photonic qubits , which require an additional pair of entangled photons per qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> in classical physics it is possible , in principle , to detect the state of a single system , for example the position and momentum of a point particle , transmit the information about that state to a remote location and then reconstruct it within a second system . </S>",
    "<S> this concept of `` classical teleportation '' underlies telecommunication techniques such as the transfer of documents via facsimile . </S>",
    "<S> quantum physics , however , excludes the possibility to detect or duplicate the state of a single microscopic system @xcite and therefore rules out all forms of classical teleportation with atoms , photons or other quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus surprising @xcite , that the state transfer between quantum systems can nevertheless be realized according to the rules of quantum physics by means of `` quantum teleportation '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure makes use of correlations between quantum systems - entanglement - which can not be described by local - realistic theories @xcite , such as classical mechanics or electrodynamics , nor any other theory within classical physics .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation lies at the core of quantum communication , which is the quantum analog of telecommunication , and can also be employed to enhance the success probability in quantum computing with photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is one of the crucial ingredients @xcite for enabling long - distance quantum cryptography - a technique to transmit information secured against eavesdropping .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of quantum teleportation for quantum information processing and communication can be seen from the long list of experimental realizations of teleportation of the state of a two - level system corresponding to the smallest unit of quantum information - one quantum bit ( qubit ) . in these realizations </S>",
    "<S> single qubits were encoded in the polarization of photons or in the superposition of vacuum and one photon states@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation with two - level atoms has been demonstrated @xcite and it has also been designed for three- and four - level atomic systems @xcite .    a way to identify quantum communication channels with high capacity ( bandwidth ) , is to employ multi - level quantum systems that carry superpositions of an arbitrary number @xmath0 of basis states  qudits  instead of sending many single qubits . </S>",
    "<S> due to their additional parameters , these systems might be optimized against the influence of external noise , such as decoherence of photonic states in turbulent atmosphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it might save resources . </S>",
    "<S> for example , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) schemes using photonic qudits can securely transmit more than one bit of information per photon @xcite . in order to achieve long - range qkd or quantum communication networks , </S>",
    "<S> so - called quantum repeaters @xcite that teleport qudits are obligatory . </S>",
    "<S> instead of qudits one could teleport multiple qubits , but at the cost of additional transcription of qudits to qubits . </S>",
    "<S> while in theory the generalization of teleportation from qubits to qudits is known ( cp .  </S>",
    "<S> for example @xcite ) , the experimental realization of qudit teleportation is a difficult task and has not yet been achieved .    at present </S>",
    "<S> , light is the only candidate for quantum communication and quantum cryptography over large distances because of its small interaction with its environment as compared to matter . </S>",
    "<S> the maximal distance for quantum communication achieved with photons so far is 144 km through the atmosphere @xcite limited mainly by absorption . </S>",
    "<S> much further distances seem only possible using teleportation of entangled photons in conjunction with quantum repeaters . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the small interaction of photons makes it difficult to manipulate the states of light in order to achieve teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> there are two main challenges in realizing teleportation : ( i ) photons sharing maximal quantum correlations ( entanglement ) have to be generated and distributed between the sender and the receiver of quantum information and ( ii ) the input photons and the photons of the sender have to be projected into a maximally entangled state by a joint measurement of both ( a so - called bell measurement ) in order to transfer the state of the input photons to the photons held by the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> both challenges can in principle be overcome using non - linear optical media , which manipulate the light depending on its intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding processes , however , have a very small efficiency on the _ single photon level_. for example , in spontaneous parametric down - conversion , an incoming pump photon is converted into a pair of entangled photons [ challenge ( i ) ] , with a probability of @xmath2 per incoming photon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of a bell measurement by means of non - linear optics [ challenge ( ii ) ] is even lower @xcite , at about @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is desirable to design a more efficient solution to both challenges based on linear optics  i.e. beam splitters , phase shifters , mirrors , etc . </S>",
    "<S> such an efficient solution is presented in this article for the teleportation of the quantum information carried by an arbitrary number @xmath0 of photonic levels . a different solution to challenge(ii ) for qutrits ( @xmath4 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative teleportation scheme for general qudits based on quantum scissors together with a comparison to the present scheme is reported in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although linear optics does not allow the realization of a complete bell measurement @xcite , a simple @xmath5 beam splitter can be used as a filter to project two incoming photons onto a particular entangled state in a certain percentage of the cases . </S>",
    "<S> two photons incident on the input ports of a beam splitter do not produce a coincidence count in two detectors in the output ports ( hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite ) unless they possess an anti - symmetric component with respect to their internal degree of freedom , e.g.  their polarization . a coincidence count thus effectively projects onto an antisymmetric state . </S>",
    "<S> for two polarized photons entering in different input ports of the beam splitter there is only one such state : @xmath6 i.e. elementary excitations of the first and second spatial mode ( represented by the first and second slot in the state symbol ) carrying horizontal and vertical polarization , respectively , superposed with excitations of these modes with swapped polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> this state is antisymmetric , because it changes sign under a permutation of the first and second mode ( slot ) , and it is maximally entangled , a condition that allows the realization of the teleportation of a qubit @xcite encoded in the polarization of a single photon . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as we shall see in the following , this phenomenon can also be employed for the simultaneous teleportation of multiple qubits encoded in the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of photons .    </S>",
    "<S> it was noticed by allen et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in 1992 that light with a phase distribution @xmath7 depending on the azimuthal angle @xmath8 in the plane orthogonal to its direction of propagation carries an orbital angular momentum of an integer @xmath9 times planck s constant @xmath10 per photon . </S>",
    "<S> such optical beams are characterized by helical ( screw - like ) wavefronts ( see fig .  [ helical ] ) and can be produced with the aid of spatial light modulators ( slms )  thin liquid crystal displays . </S>",
    "<S> the slm modulates the optical beam with a helical phase pattern . the orbital angular momentum of a photon </S>",
    "<S> can thus be used to carry information and represents a quantum system with an unrestricted number of levels .        </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation using an incomplete bell measurement ( a `` bell filter '' ) can be applied to systems with an arbitrary number of levels , not only simple two - level systems ( such as polarized photons ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us review how . </S>",
    "<S> teleportation involves three parties alice , bob and charlie , cp .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tele - schematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> alice and bob are far apart and share a pair of systems in a maximally entangled state @xmath11 which is a superposition of products of orthogonal basis states of their @xmath12-level systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> charlie provides alice with an unknown state @xmath15 , which has to be transferred from charlie s system @xmath16 to bob s system @xmath14 . for </S>",
    "<S> this purpose systems @xmath16 and @xmath14 must be similar - @xmath14 has to support the same states as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the state to be teleported can thus be expressed as a superposition of bob s basis states : @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> .     produces a pair of systems @xmath13 and @xmath14 in state @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> system @xmath13 and system @xmath16 are to be projected by a filter @xmath19 into state @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if successful , the filtering transfers the initial state of @xmath16 to system @xmath14.,width=321 ]    alice successfully teleports the state @xmath15 if she carries out a measurement that acts like a filter and projects systems @xmath16 and @xmath13 onto the entangled state @xmath20 :    @xmath21_{ca }   \\otimes { 1\\hspace{-1.41mm}1}_b   \\right )    & = \\frac{1}{d^{3/2}}\\sum_{k , l= 0}^{d-1 } \\alpha_k    a_l\\rangle_a \\otimes |b_k\\rangle_b   \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{d}|\\psi\\rangle_{ca}\\otimes |\\chi\\rangle_b\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{teleport1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    according to the rules of quantum mechanics the likelihood for such a projection to occur is given by the square of the length of the resulting state vector , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the success probability of this teleportation scheme , which uses only one of the outcomes of a bell measurement , decreases with the number @xmath12 of basis states in which quantum information is encoded . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage lies in the fact that this concept of teleportation , which is used for photonic qubits ( @xmath23 can be generalised to teleport states with arbitrary @xmath12 using linear optics . </S>",
    "<S> ( for an alternative approach based on quantum scissors @xcite that uses entanglement contained in single - photon states see @xcite ) . </S>"
