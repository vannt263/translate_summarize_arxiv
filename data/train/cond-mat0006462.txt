    "the lifshitz point occurs in a variety of physical systems and has been extensively studied over the last twenty - five years @xcite .",
    "it appears in high-@xmath5 superconductivity @xcite , polymer physics @xcite , ferroelectric liquid crystals @xcite , etc .. in magnetic systems , the uniaxial lifshitz critical behavior can be described by an axially next - nearest - neighbor ising model ( annni ) .",
    "it consists of a spin-@xmath6 system on a cubic lattice ( @xmath7 ) with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic couplings and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions along a single lattice axis @xcite .",
    "the competition gives origin to a modulated phase , in addition to the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic ones . in spite of having several modulated phases ,",
    "it was shown recently that around the lifshitz critical region , a simple field - theoretic setting can be defined for this annni model @xcite . in general , the antiferromagnetic couplings can show up in @xmath8 directions . in that case , the system possesses the @xmath8-fold lifshitz critical point . here",
    "we are going to focus our attention in the uniaxial case ( @xmath9 ) , since some materials present this type of critical behavior .",
    "mnp was studied both theoretically and experimentally and displays the uniaxial behavior @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies involving the uniaxial lifshitz point have been put forth using analytical and numerical tools .",
    "examples of the latter are high - temperature series expansion @xcite and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "conformal invariance calculations in @xmath10 ( in the context of strongly anisotropic criticality ) @xcite and @xmath11-expansion techniques @xcite have been the main analytical tools available to dealing with this kind of system .    from the field - theoretic point of view , the critical dimension of a scalar field theory describing the uniaxial lifshitz critical behavior is found ( by using the ginzburg criterion ) to be @xmath12 . the expansion parameter is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the space dimension of the system under consideration .",
    "( in the pure ising model the expansion parameter is @xmath15 ) .",
    "as is well known , the critical exponents for the lifshitz point at one - loop approximation have the same dependence in @xmath16 as those from the pure ising model have in @xmath11 .",
    "of particular importance is the effect of the mixing of the two momenta scales , i. e. , along and perpendicular to the competing axis .",
    "one can choose a convenient symmetry point to fix the external momenta scale in the quartic and quadratic directions .",
    "then , the one - loop integral contributing to the four - point function , needed to find out the fixed point , can be performed without any approximation . the choice which simplifies the referred integral is to set the external momenta scale in the quartic direction to zero .",
    "the solution of this integral yields a leading singularity and a regular term in @xmath16 .",
    "the leading singularity in @xmath2 can be chosen to be the same as that obtained in @xmath11 when solving the analogous one - loop integral for the ising model ( by absorbing a convenient angular factor in a redefinition of the coupling constant ) , even though the coefficients of the regular terms in @xmath2 and @xmath11 are slightly different and depend on @xmath8 in the lifshitz case @xcite .",
    "thus , although the multiplicative factors to be absorbed in the coupling constant are different in the two cases , the critical exponents have the same dependence on the expansion parameter .",
    "we can then ask ourselves if this happens to be true when we proceed to calculate the critical exponents in higher orders in the perturbative expansion .",
    "going one step further to evaluate higher order integrals in the loop expansion would be highly desirable using the same line of reasoning . in this way",
    ", all the dependence in the external momenta is along the @xmath17 directions , perpendicular to the competition axis . in the resulting @xmath2-expansion",
    ", the leading singularities can be chosen equal to those coming from the theory without competition ( see below ) .",
    "the nontrivial new features of this expansion around the usual quadratic field theory are the coefficients of the subleading singularities and of the regular terms , which are no longer rational numbers .",
    "this approach would allow to treat this system properly in a perturbative expansion at least for correlation functions along the perpendicular directions to the competition axis .",
    "a better comprehension of this procedure might shed light in the perturbative study of higher order derivative field theories . in this sense",
    ", the lifshitz critical behavior seems to be the natural laboratory to study higher order field theories in a perturbative framework .",
    "we report on what we believe to be the first study of critical exponents at two - loop order for the uniaxial lifshitz point . using @xmath18 field theory and the expansion in powers of @xmath13 in the lifshitz critical point ,",
    "we give a detailed account of the calculation of the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which by now can be viewed as a worked out example of a recent generalization obtained for anisotropic behaviors @xcite . in order to solve higher - loop integrals",
    "we introduce a constraint relating the loop momenta in internal and external subdiagrams along the competing axis .",
    "the results for these integrals are consistent with homogeneity of the feynman integrals in the external quadratic momenta scale .",
    "the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 are associated with the directions perpendicular to the competition axis .",
    "( the exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 associated with the competition axis are not going to be considered here and we shall analyse them in another work . )",
    "we then obtain the exponent @xmath1 via scaling relations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the notation and calculate the relevant integrals for the determination of the critical exponents at two - loop level .",
    "we present the critical exponents @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 in section 3 . in section 4 we discuss our results and compare the @xmath1 exponent with numerical estimates based on monte carlo methods and high - temperature series .",
    "the lifshitz critical behavior can be described using a modified @xmath23 field theory .",
    "the bare lagrangian associated with the uniaxial critical behavior is given by : @xmath24    the competition is responsible for the appearance of the quartic term in the free propagator .",
    "the lifshitz critical point is characterized by the values @xmath25 . from now on , this is the case which interests us in this work .",
    "first , we are going to compute the renormalized coupling constant at the fixed point . in order to find out the factor that shall be absorbed in the coupling constant",
    ", we quickly review the one - loop contribution to the four point function @xcite .",
    "the relevant integral is :    @xmath26    the external momenta are @xmath27 along the quartic ( competing ) direction and @xmath28 along the @xmath17 quadratic directions .",
    "we then choose a symmetry point which simplifies the integral at external momenta @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "using schwinger s parameterization we get    @xmath31    the @xmath32 integral is straightforward .",
    "it can be performed to give @xmath33 the next step is to compute the @xmath34 integration , which is :    @xmath35    replacing equations ( [ e5 ] ) , ( [ e6 ] ) into equation ( [ e4 ] ) together with the value @xmath30 , one finds @xmath36    we can perform one of the integrals in the schwinger parameters using a change of variables .",
    "set @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the integral over @xmath39 can be done , and we are left with    @xmath40    now we make the continuation @xmath41 .",
    "one obtains a result in terms of gamma functions with non integer arguments",

    "this allows one to obtain the @xmath2-expansion when the gamma functions have non integer arguments .",
    "replacing eqs .",

    "we absorb in the coupling constant a geometric angular factor , which is @xmath46 , where @xmath47^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "then the redefined integral is :    @xmath48    or @xmath49    we suppress the tilde hereafter to simplify the notation .",
    "we have to keep in mind that we should divide out this factor for each loop integration .",
    "we now turn our attention to higher - loop integrals . in practice",
    ", we have to calculate the two - loop integrals @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the three - loop integral @xmath52 , in order to find the fixed point at two - loop level and the critical exponents . the subscript @xmath53 is used to denote our choice of the subtraction point .",
    "they are given by ( see figure 1 ) :    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    in the first two integrals , @xmath28 is the external momentum ( associated with the two - point vertex ) along @xmath17 directions , whereas @xmath27 is the external momentum along the competition axis .",
    "inside the integral @xmath57 , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 being the external momenta ( associated with the four - point vertex ) along the quadratic directions , and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the external momenta along the quartic direction .",
    "the symmetry point is chosen as follows .",
    "we set all the external momenta at the competition axis equal to zero .",
    "for the four - point vertex , the external momenta along the quadratic directions are chosen as @xmath62 .",
    "we fix the momentum scale of the two - point function through @xmath63 .",
    "now we can study the solution of the higher - loop integrals shown above .",
    "consider the integral @xmath64 . with our choice for the quartic external momenta it is given by :    @xmath65",
    "first , we perform the integral over the internal bubble , i.e. , we integrate over @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in order to solve the internal bubble we demand that the loop momenta @xmath68 should be related to @xmath67 .",
    "note that we could have chosen the other way around , since the integral is symmetric under the exchange @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "there are two issues which need to be emphasized here .",
    "first , the lifshitz point condition eliminates the quadratic part of the momenta along the competition axis , for @xmath71 .",
    "second , the remaining quartic part of the integral mixes the two loop momenta ( @xmath72 ) in different subdiagrams , yielding crossed terms which are difficult to integrate . indeed , using schwinger parameters and carrying out the integration over @xmath73 first",
    ", we obtain @xmath74    in order to integrater over @xmath75 , we have to expand the argument of the last exponential .",
    "this results in a complicated function of @xmath76 and @xmath75 , which has no elementary primitive . considering the remaining terms as a damping factor to the integrand",
    ", the maximum of the integrand will be either at @xmath77 or at @xmath78 .",
    "( the most general choice @xmath79 yields a hypergeometric function . )",
    "the constraint eliminates the crossed terms and is the simplest way to disentangle the two quartic integrals in the loop momenta .",
    "the choice @xmath78 implies that @xmath80 varies in the internal bubble , but not in an arbitrary manner .",
    "its variation is dominated by @xmath75 through this constraint , which eliminates the dependence on @xmath80 in the internal subdiagram .",
    "integrating over @xmath75 yields a simple factor to the remaining parametric integrals ( over the two schwinger parameters ) proportional to @xmath81 .",
    "after solving the parametric integrals we find :    @xmath82^{\\frac{\\epsilon_{l}}{2 } } } i_{2}\\;\\;.\\ ] ]    we use schwinger s parameterization again to solve this integral along the quartic direction .",
    "we obtain : @xmath83^{\\frac{3}{4 } } [ ( q_{1 } + p)^{2}]^ { \\frac{\\epsilon_l}{2}}}\\;\\;.\\ ] ] the difference with respect to the pure @xmath84 theory is that after performing the quartic integral , we get a exponent for the quadratic part of the momenta which is not an integer . at this point",
    ", one can use feynman parameters to solve the momentum integrals .",
    "the dependence of the integral in the external momenta is proportional to @xmath85 , in conformity with the homogeneity of the feynman integrals in the external momenta scale . deriving with respect to @xmath86 and setting @xmath30",
    ", we find :    @xmath87.\\ ] ]    the integral @xmath57 can be calculated in a similar fashion .",

    "therefore    @xmath88}\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we changed variables from @xmath89 .",
    "we set @xmath90 in the internal bubble @xmath91 ( as we did for @xmath92 ) , and integrate over @xmath91 .",
    "we then have    @xmath93^{\\frac{\\epsilon_l}{2}}}\\;\\;.\\ ] ]    we use schwinger s parameterization to get rid of the @xmath68 integral . after performing the change of variables used to calculate the one - loop integral and a rescaling",
    ", we can solve one of the parametric integrals to get    @xmath94^{\\frac{\\epsilon_l}{2}}}\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    in order to perform the integral over @xmath95 , we make use of a feynman parameter obtaining    @xmath96^{-\\epsilon_l}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there is a subtlety that needs to be analyzed with care .",
    "here we proceed in complete analogy to the pure @xmath97 theory @xcite .",
    "the integral over @xmath98 is singular at @xmath99 when @xmath100 .",

    "the coefficient of the integral is proportional to @xmath103 , which cancels the @xmath2 in front of the logarithm .",
    "the logarithm contributes only to the order @xmath104 and can be neglected .",
    "we then find    @xmath105.\\ ] ]    finally , let us describe the computation of the three - loop integral @xmath106 . at zero external momenta along the competition axis , this integral reads : @xmath107 the integral is symmetric in @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "as the loop momenta are dummy variables , the two internal bubbles are really the same .",
    "that is why we do not need more than one relation among the loop momenta in the external and internal bubbles , even though this is a three - loop diagram ( with two internal bubbles ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", we can solve the two integrals independently in the following way .",
    "in the internal bubble @xmath110 we set @xmath111 , as well as @xmath90 over the other internal bubble @xmath91 .",
    "apparently we have two different relations among the loop momenta , but one of them is artificial .",
    "this means that the two internal bubbles give the same contribution , i.e. the integration over the internal bubbles is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "thus    @xmath113^{\\epsilon_l } } \\;\\;.\\ ] ]    we integrate first over @xmath68 and proceed analogously as before , to find the following result :    @xmath114.\\ ] ]    we stress once again that the constraint preserves the physical principle of homogeneity in all the higher - loop feynman integrals in the external momenta scale , which is consistent with scaling theory . with the integrals calculated in this way",
    ", we can find out the exponents as is going to be shown in the next section .",
    "to compute the critical exponents associated to the ferromagnetic planes at the lifshitz critical point , one may use the standard field - theoretic approach @xcite .",
    "this is possible since no new renormalization constants need to be introduced in this case . from the results for @xmath115 , eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , and @xmath116 , eq . ( [ 12 ] ) , we note that these integrals do not have the same leading singularities as in pure @xmath97 theory . as an approximation",
    ", we introduce a weight factor for the two point vertex function , in order to identify the leading singularities with the ones appearing in the pure @xmath97 field theory .",
    "this factor is @xmath117 for the integrals above .",
    "this approximation is suitable when one considers the generalization for the @xmath8-fold case with @xmath118 . in this way",
    ", we have a smooth transition from the isinglike case ( @xmath119 ) to the general lifshitz anisotropic critical behavior ( @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
    "the bare and renormalized quantities are related through @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the bare parameters in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . as usual ,",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath125 are the wave - function and coupling constant renormalization constants , respectively .",

    "we compute the fixed point at two - loop level .",

    "for this uniaxial case , our results express the critical exponents in a higher order in @xmath2 compared to earlier investigations .",
    "a detailed comparison with other methods is provided in the next section .",
    "first of all , our result for the exponent @xmath20 is in agreement with mukamel s calculation @xcite at @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , our method is equivalent to integrating over the momentum shell as was done in his work using the landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian approach .    for the annni model",
    ", @xmath150 is the former monte carlo output @xcite , whereas the best estimates from the high - temperature series is @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "note that we use the subscript @xmath1 instead of @xmath152 , since it was shown recently that the exponents parallel and perpendicular to the competition axis obey independent scaling laws @xcite .",
    "our two - loop calculation obtained from the @xmath2-expansion via the scaling law ( when neglecting @xmath153 terms ) in three dimensions yields @xmath154 .",
    "this agrees ( within the error bar ) with the former monte carlo result , the difference being of order @xmath155 .",
    "nevertheless , the most recent high - precision numerical monte carlo estimate for the annni model yielded @xmath156 @xcite . in order to figure out how to extract the best numerical results from the @xmath2-expansion when the @xmath2 parameter is not small ( which is the case for @xmath7 )",
    ", a comparison with the ising model is worthwhile . for the exponent @xmath157 in three dimensions , the @xmath11-expansion gives a contribution of 0.167 at @xmath158 and 0.077 at @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath158 contributes with @xmath160 and the order @xmath161 with @xmath162 to the value of @xmath157 ( @xmath163 ) , respectively . for the uniaxial lifshitz case ,",
    "the contributions for the @xmath1 index are @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) and @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the very close values of the contributions of first and second order to @xmath1 ( as the @xmath16 parameter is 1.5 not being a small number ) , indicates that neglecting @xmath153 could be a dangerous step in obtaining the exponent @xmath1 via scaling relations in a more accurate way .",
    "indeed , had we replaced the numerical values obtained for @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath7 directly into the scaling law , we would have obtained @xmath170 . as argued in @xcite for the other critical exponents @xmath171 and @xmath172 , whenever @xmath173 one should use the _ numerical _ values of @xmath19",
    ", @xmath20 obtained from the @xmath2-expansion for fixed values of @xmath174 in order to obtain the numerical values of the other exponents via scaling laws .",
    "therefore , provided we give this new interpretation to the numerical output of the @xmath2-expansion when @xmath173 , we consider that the agreement between the numerical ( monte carlo ) and analytical ( @xmath16-expansion ) results is remarkable for @xmath7 . the numerical value obtained here for the correlation length exponent is @xmath168 . the experimental value of this critical index is still lacking . we hope our result sheds some light towards its experimental determination .",
    "the extension of the present method to the calculation of critical exponents for the @xmath8-fold ( @xmath118 ) case reduces to the ising - like case when @xmath119 and to the present case when @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an interesting open question is the calculation of the critical exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 using the @xmath2-expansion at two - loop level . the approach followed here is not suitable to computing these critical exponents ( parallel to the competition axis ) , since our choice of the symmetry point prevents a proper treatment in this direction .",
    "the possibility of devising another symmetry point to deal with these exponents seems to be feasible , and will be reported elsewhere .    in recent articles",
    ", some authors @xcite studied an alternative field - theoretic approach based on coordinate space calculations . in the first paper they recovered the results of reference @xcite for the cases @xmath175 analytically , but only could get the exponents numerically for the @xmath176 case , working entirely in coordinate space .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that they computed the fixed point only at one - loop order ( see equation ( 82 ) in the mentioned paper ) . in the second paper , they computed the critical exponents at second order in perturbation theory by making use of a hybrid mechanism , going to coordinate or momentum space according to the necessity through a scaling function related to the free propagator in coordinate space .",
    "they obtained the exponents , whose coefficients of each power of @xmath2 are integrals to be performed numerically .",
    "the very similar values obtained for the exponents using their method or ours confirms that momentum and coordinate space calculations should give the same results , since either our approximation or the numerical approximation made by them @xcite is responsible for a rather small deviation in the two results when compared to the above numerical values .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found a way to perform two- and three - loop integrals for the uniaxial lifshitz point , needed to calculate universal properties at directions perpendicular to the competition axis . the constraint in the loop momenta at the competition direction is the key ingredient to carry out the calculations . in this approximation",
    ", the loop momenta along the competition axis are not conserved when one uses this constraint .",
    "however the momenta along the @xmath17 directions are conserved .",
    "momentum non - conservation along the competing direction as a higher - order effect does not seem to affect the critical exponents considered here in a significant way , as indicated by the comparison of our study with the available numerical data for the @xmath7 case",
    ".    it might be interesting to study general field theories including higher order derivative terms in this new framework .",
