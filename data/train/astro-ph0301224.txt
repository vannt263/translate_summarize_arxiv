    "elliptical galaxies constitute a rather uniform family of stellar spheroids whose dynamical and photometric properties satisfy a number of scaling relations and whose detailed internal structure appear to vary weakly but systematically with galaxy mass .",
    "perhaps the most important of such scaling relations is the fundamental plane ; a tight correlation between the luminosity , size , and velocity dispersion that has been extensively used as a sensitive distance indicator ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the existence of the fundamental plane is believed to reflect largely the virial theorem , as applied to systems where the dark matter content , as well as perhaps age and metallicity , vary monotonically as a function of luminosity .",
    "subtler dynamical and photometric indicators also vary with luminosity ; bright ellipticals are typically slowly - rotating triaxial structures supported by anisotropic velocity dispersion tensors , whereas rotation is thought to play a more substantial role in the dynamics of fainter ellipticals ( davies et al .",
    "1983 ; bender & nieto 1990 ; halliday et al .",
    "this dynamical distinction is reflected in isophotal deviations from perfect ellipses : fast - rotating spheroids are usually `` disky '' , in contrast with the `` boxy '' isophotal shapes of slowly rotating systems ( bender 1988 ) . such deviations  although significant and robustly measured  are usually small , and simple concentric ellipsoidal models provide a rough but reasonable description of the structure of many elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed , detailed dynamical analysis indicates that most ellipticals are globally only mildly triaxial , as indicated , for example , by the weak misalignment between photometric and dynamical principal axes ( de zeeuw & franx 1991 ; franx , illingworth , & de zeeuw 1991 ) .",
    "these structural trends hold important clues to the formation and evolution of ellipticals , and are not straightforward to account for in traditional models of elliptical galaxy formation . in the `` monolithic collapse '' model put forward by partridge & peebles ( 1967 )",
    ", all stars in an elliptical galaxy form coevally at very early times as a result of the coherent , dissipationless collapse of a large mass of gas transformed into stars in a short and intense bout of star formation .",
    "this simple model accounts naturally for the old apparent ages of spheroid stars , for their high densities , and for the weak evolution in the spheroidal population properties with time , but is less successful at explaining the detailed luminosity dependence of their dynamical properties ; the apparent scarcity of very large starbursts in the high - redshift universe ; and the origin of dynamical peculiarities suggestive of recent accretion events ( e.g. , franx & illingworth 1988 ; jedrzejewski & schechter 1988 ; surma & bender 1995 ; de zeeuw et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in its most extreme form",
    ", the competing `` hierarchical assembly '' model posits that spheroidal galaxies form through the violent merger of preexisting disk galaxies ( toomre 1977 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the epoch of assembly of ellipticals differs markedly from the epoch of formation of their constituent stars , and the high density of ellipticals is ascribed to the effects of dissipation during the formation of the progenitor disks .",
    "this model accounts `` naturally '' for the scarcity of very bright elliptical progenitors at high - redshift ; for the rapid evolution of the galaxy population with lookback time ; and for the presence of dynamical peculiarities .",
    "it is , on the other hand , less successful at explaining the apparent old ages of stars in ellipticals and the uniformity in their dynamical properties .",
    "indeed , it has been plausibly argued that the remnants of major mergers between stellar disks can not reproduce the steep central surface brightness profiles of ellipticals , and that dissipationless merger remnants are too triaxial , anisotropic , and kinematically peculiar to be consistent with normal ellipticals ( barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "one possible solution to these problems is to argue that the hierarchical mergers that lead to the formation of ellipticals are gas - rich , and that substantial dissipation takes place during the collision , where renewed star formation of gas driven to the center can steepen the luminosity profiles and even out misalignments in the dynamical structure .",
    "this possibility has been explored by mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ; and references therein ) who find that major mergers may actually be too efficient at funneling gas towards the center , leading to extremely dense stellar cores in disagreement with observation .    taken together",
    ", this body of work suggests that it might indeed be possible to reconcile the observed structural properties of ellipticals with the hierarchical formation scenario , but only provided that star formation somehow regulates effectively the flow of accreting gas within galaxies , especially during mergers .",
    "thus , accounting self - consistently for the frequency of merging  which is determined largely by the cosmological context of formation  is crucial for the success of the modeling and has yet to be taken into account properly in simulation work .",
    "we present here the result of our first attempt at simulating the formation of an elliptical galaxy _ ab initio _ within the popular @xmath0cdm cosmogony .",
    "the simulation evolves self - consistently a region destined to aggregate into a single dark matter halo and includes the gravitational and hydrodynamical effects of dark matter and baryons , photo - heating by a uv background , compton and radiative cooling , as well as star formation and feedback processes .",
    "the main evolutionary features of this simulation have been presented by steinmetz & navarro ( 2002 ) .",
    "this is one of the new generation of simulations able to resolve the internal dynamics of galaxies whilst accounting properly for the cosmological context of the formation process ( see also abadi et al .",
    "2003a , b ; governato et al . 2002 ; sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2002a , b ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath4 structure and kinematics of the stellar component of the simulation reported by steinmetz & navarro ( 2002 ) .    major aims of this paper are to validate the analysis techniques that we intend to apply to a statistically meaningful set of simulations ( under preparation ) of comparable numerical resolution , as well as to identify potential disagreements between simulation and observation that may prompt a radical revision of our simulation algorithm or of the adopted cosmological model .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : nummeth ] presents a brief description of our numerical techniques , whereas   [ sec : results ] presents the main results of the simulation .",
    "we summarize our findings in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the simulation was performed using grapesph , a code that combines the hardware n - body integrator grape with the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique ( steinmetz 1996 ) .",
    "grapesph is a fully three - dimensional , lagrangian technique optimally suited to study the formation of highly nonlinear systems in a cosmological context .",
    "the version used here includes the self - gravity of gas , stars , and dark matter ; a three - dimensional treatment of the hydrodynamics of the gas ; compton and radiative cooling ; the effects of a photoionizing uv background ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) ; as well as a simple recipe for transforming gas into stars .",
    "the numerical recipe for star formation , feedback and metal enrichment is similar to that described in steinmetz & mller ( 1994 , 1995 ; see also katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ) . in this scheme ,",
    "star particles are created in collapsing regions that are locally jeans unstable , at a rate controlled by the local cooling and dynamical timescales , @xmath10.the parameter @xmath11 effectively controls the depletion timescale of gas in regions of high density , where most star formation takes place and where @xmath12 .",
    "star particles are only affected by gravitational forces , but they devolve @xmath13 ergs ( per solar mass of stars formed ) into their surrounding gas over the @xmath14 yrs following their formation . this energy input  a crude attempt to mimic the energetic feedback from evolving massive stars and supernovae  is mainly invested into raising the internal energy ( temperature ) of the surrounding gas . however , because stars form in high - density regions , where cooling timescales are short , this feedback energy is almost immediately radiated away .    in order to allow for more effective feedback we assume that a certain fraction of the available energy , @xmath15 , is invested in modifying the kinetic energy of the surrounding gas .",
    "these gas motions can still be dissipated through shocks , but on longer timescales , reducing the star formation efficiency and extending the timescale for the conversion of gas into stars .",
    "our star formation recipe thus involves two free parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath15 , which we set by matching the star formation rate of isolated disks to those observed in the local universe ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "we have adopted @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the simulation reported here .",
    "this is a conservative choice in the sense that the resulting feedback is relatively inefficient at regulating star formation : the rate at which gas cools and accretes at the center of dark matter halos effectively determines the star formation rate .",
    "the simulation assumes the popular `` concordance '' @xmath0cdm scenario ; a flat , low - density universe ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) where the mass is dominated by cold dark matter , with a modest baryonic contribution ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the present day expansion rate is parameterized by @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0cdm power spectrum is normalized so that the linear present - day rms mass fluctuations on spheres of radius @xmath22 mpc is @xmath23 .",
    "we simulate a region that evolves to form at @xmath4 a dark halo of mass @xmath24 .",
    "this halo is selected from a cosmological simulation of a periodic @xmath25 mpc box and resimulated at higher resolution , including the full tidal field of the original calculation .",
    "details on this procedure may be found in katz & white ( 1993 ) , navarro & white ( 1994 ) and navarro & steinmetz ( 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the mass of gas and dark matter particles is initially @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the ( plummer ) gravitational softening lengthscale is fixed at 0.5 ( physical ) kpc .    , dashed lines to the mass within 100 ( physical ) kpc , and dotted lines to the mass within the luminous radius , @xmath29 ( physical ) kpc .",
    "[ figs : massev ] ]    .",
    "downward - pointing arrows indicate the time of formation of the first @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath5 of the stars , respectively .",
    "major mergers are typically associated with short bursts of star formation that show as peaks in the age distribution .",
    "overall , the age distribution is well approximated by an exponential law of age @xmath32 gyr and e - folding timescale @xmath33 gyr ( see dashed line ) .",
    "this is comparable to what is usually assumed in spectrophotometric modeling of the spectral energy distribution of elliptical galaxies ( guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "[ figs : agehist ] ]      galaxy luminosities are computed by simply adding the luminosities of each star particle , taking into account the time of creation of each particle and using the latest version of the spectrophotometric models of contardo , steinmetz , & fritze - von alvensleben ( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is independent of time .",
    "quantitative measures quoted in this paper assume a scalo ( 1986 ) imf truncated at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the spectrophotometric modeling requires a measure of the metallicity of the stars .",
    "grapesph tracks ( crudely ) the metal content of each gaseous particle by assuming that each `` star '' devolves a total of @xmath36 of enriched material ( per @xmath37 of stars formed ) to the surrounding gas during the @xmath38 yrs following its creation .",
    "these metals are dispersed amongst the gas particles neighboring the star , and their metal content is in turn inherited by the star particles they spawn .",
    "our treatment of metal enrichment neglects diffusion processes and is not intended to reproduce the fe - rich enrichment by type ia supernovae , which is thought to occur on a much longer timescale .",
    "given its crudeness , we restrict our use of the metallicity of gas and stars to the spectrophotometric modeling of the stellar populations .",
    "it is our intention , however , to include in future work a self - consistent treatment of metal enrichment by type i and ii supernovae in order to tap the potential of heavy element abundance patterns in judging the success of the modeling .",
    "this is an important task , as it has been argued that it might be difficult to reproduce the alpha element - enhanced abundance of ellipticals in hierarchical scenarios of formation ( see , e.g. , thomas 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "as described in detail by steinmetz & navarro ( 2002 ) , the formation of the galaxy is characterized by episodes of smooth accretion and by a number of merger events , some of which are clearly visible in figures  [ figs : faceon ] and  [ figs : edgeon ] .",
    "these figures show the stellar component within a @xmath39 ( physical ) kpc box centered on the most massive progenitor at different times .",
    "star particles are colored according to age ( blue and red correspond to ages @xmath40 and @xmath41 gyr , respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ figs : faceon ] ( [ figs : edgeon ] ) shows the system projected along an axis chosen so that the galaxy at @xmath42 is seen face - on ( edge - on ) .",
    "the morphology of the galaxy varies substantially in response to changes in the dominant mode of mass accretion .",
    "mergers between progenitors of comparable mass are frequent at early times .",
    "one of these events is clearly visible in the top left panels of figures  [ figs : faceon ] and  [ figs : edgeon ] .",
    "major mergers mix stars into a spheroid , around which smoothly accreting gas may subsequently wrap to form a new disk - like component . at @xmath43",
    "the simulated galaxy resembles a bright sa / sb spiral : over @xmath44 of the rest - frame optical luminosity comes from a roughly exponential disk while the rest comes from a spheroidal component whose spatial distribution may be well approximated by an @xmath45-law .",
    "the disk continues to grow gradually until it is tidally shaken by a massive satellite ( seen in the @xmath46 panel of figures  [ figs : faceon ] and  [ figs : edgeon ] ) into a clearly - defined barred pattern .",
    "the bar is resilient and survives the accretion ( at @xmath47 ) of the satellite that triggered its formation . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the galaxy undergoes a further and final major merger with another disk galaxy about one third as massive . during the collision , the remaining gas ( @xmath48 of the total baryonic mass ) is efficiently funneled to the center , where it is quickly converted into stars ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ) .",
    "this last episode of star formation is effectively over by @xmath49 , leaving only a small ( @xmath50 kpc diameter ) ` core ' of younger , metal - rich stars , surrounded by a large spheroid of older stars .",
    "morphologically , the @xmath51 merger turns the galaxy from a centrifugally supported disk into a slowly - tumbling spheroid that quickly relaxes into the final configuration which is the subject of the study we report here .",
    "quantitatively , the mass assembly process is summarized in figure  [ figs : massev ] , where we plot the evolution of the mass in the dark matter , gas , and stellar components within various radii . from top to bottom , the curves in figure  [ figs : massev ] correspond to the mass within the virial radius .",
    "we parameterize the present value of hubble s constant as @xmath52 km s@xmath53 mpc@xmath53 .",
    "all distance - dependent quantities assume @xmath54 . ] , @xmath55 ; within @xmath56 ( physical ) kpc ; and within the `` luminous '' radius , @xmath29 ( physical ) kpc . all of these curves show that the assembly of the galaxy is essentially complete by @xmath57 , just after the last major accretion event .",
    "indeed , the mass within @xmath58 remains approximately constant after that time , although that within @xmath55 continues to increase , mainly due to the time - dependent definition of the virial radius .",
    "the @xmath57 merger leads to a short starburst that depletes ( into stars ) the last @xmath59 of gas within the merging galaxies .",
    "the final stellar mass of the galaxy is essentially fixed at this event , since little gaseous material is added to the galaxy afterwards ; stars age passively for the remaining @xmath60 gyr of the evolution .",
    "the galaxy thus has no opportunity to re - form a stellar disk , and its morphology at @xmath4 is consistent with that of elliptical galaxies .",
    "some of the properties of the galaxy at @xmath4 are summarized in tables  [ tab : gxprop ] and [ tab : gxphot ] .",

    "most stars identified within @xmath58 at @xmath4 are old ; the first @xmath30 of the stars form before @xmath122 ; the median formation redshift is @xmath123 and only @xmath124 of the stars have formed in the past @xmath125 gyr .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ figs : agehist ] shows that , overall , the age distribution compares well with that expected from an exponentially declining star formation rate , @xmath126 , initiated @xmath127 gyrs ago .",
    "these parameters are not dissimilar from those used to model elliptical galaxies spectrophotometrically ( e.g. , guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , so we expect the broad - band colors and other major photometric indicators of the simulated galaxy to be in reasonable agreement with those of elliptical galaxies . the numerical resolution achieved in this simulation ( at @xmath4",
    "there are more than @xmath128 stars within the luminous radius , @xmath58 ) allows us to examine in detail the structure of the simulated galaxy and to assess whether the morphological likeness to an elliptical at @xmath4 is further substantiated by the detailed photometric and kinematic properties of the galaxy .",
    "we turn our attention to this issue next .         and @xmath129 color profiles for the simulated galaxy , compared with those of the `` normal '' ( top panel ) and `` compact '' ( bottom panel ) ellipticals shown in figure  [ figs : sfbprof ] .",

    "there are no rescalings allowed in this figure and therefore the mismatch between simulated and observed ellipticals is genuine : the simulated galaxy is significantly more concentrated than ic708 ( open triangles ) and a23514 + 2813 ( open squares ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the effective radii of these galaxies : in the @xmath102-band the effective radius of kia1 is @xmath130 kpc , but those of ic708 and a23514 + 2813 are @xmath131 and @xmath132 kpc , respectively .",
    "the simulated galaxy thus resembles examples of the much rarer class of m32-like `` compact '' ellipticals , such as a15106 + 1037 or ic1639 , shown in the right panel of figure  [ figs : sfbprof ] .",
    "these are galaxies of unusually small effective radii ( or unusually high surface brightness ) for their luminosity ; the effective radii are @xmath133 and @xmath134 kpc for a15106 + 1037 and ic1639 , respectively , comparable to that measured for kia1 .",
    "the high concentration of the stellar component may be traced to the copious star formation that accompanies at high redshift the dissipative collapse of the galaxy s progenitors .",
    "these progenitors are extremely dense and compact , and their density is inherited by the final remnant .",
    "it is not clear at this time whether this is a generic prediction of this cosmogony or of a simulation procedure where feedback affects only minimally the timing and mode of gas cooling and accretion .",
    "indeed , results reported by other groups ( governato et al . 2002 ; sommer - larsen et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , indicate that it is likely that a different implementation of star formation and feedback  e.g .",
    ", one that prevents more effectively the onset of star formation in early collapsing progenitors  might bring simulations into better agreement between the observed structure of normal galaxies .",
    "the numerous merger episodes that characterize the formation of the simulated galaxy lead to a fairly uniform stellar component with little sign of radial gradients in stellar age .",
    "this is reflected in the rather uniform color profiles shown in figure  [ figs : colprof ] .",
    "this figure compares the @xmath129 and @xmath135 color profiles of kia1 with four ellipticals shown in figure  [ figs : sfbprof ] . because of its old age ,",
    "the colors of the simulated galaxy are quite red , comparable to those of normal ellipticals ( top panel in figure  [ figs : colprof ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the colors of compact ellipticals are typically bluer and show greater variety than those of normal ellipticals . furthermore , observed ellipticals show a mild propensity for reddish cores which is not reproduced in the simulated galaxy .",
    "it is likely , however , that such a tendency is a result of metallicity gradients , which would be poorly captured by our rudimentary numerical treatment of metal enrichment .    to summarize ,",
    "the simulated elliptical is morphologically closer to a compact elliptical than to a normal one , but it appears as if its stellar population resembles more that of normal ellipticals .",
    "thus , to bring the simulated galaxy into closer agreement with observation one would need to either distend the tightly bound stellar structure of the simulated galaxy without changing its colors or else allow for recent episodes of star formation in order to account for the bluer colors of compact ellipticals .",
    "either alternative would require a major revision to the way in which star formation and feedback are modeled in our numerical code .",
    "this result is similar to that reported by abadi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) for a simulated disk galaxy in the @xmath0cdm scenario . since abadi et al . used the same numerical code as in the present study , it appears as if stellar systems that are too concentrated to be consistent with observation are a generic feature of our simulation procedure .",
    "we intend to explore systematically the sensitivity of this result to our choice of star formation and feedback algorithm in future papers of this series .",
    "figure  [ figs : velmap ] contrasts the photometric structure of the simulated galaxy with a map of the line - of - sight mean velocity field along 10 different projections .",

    "this is the kinematic signature expected for an oblate rotator whose shape is mainly determined by rotation ; a result confirmed by figure  [ figs : oblate ] , where we plot the apparent ellipticity of the galaxy versus the ratio between the apparent rotation speed and the velocity dispersion , @xmath7 , measured at @xmath147 .",
    "the solid squares correspond to the different projections shown in figure  [ figs : velmap ] .",
    "the thick solid line in figure  [ figs : oblate ] corresponds to an `` oblate rotator '' where rotation dictates the shape of the stellar distribution ( see figure 4 - 6 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the agreement between the solid line and the solid squares provides strong evidence for the importance of rotation in the structure of the simulated galaxy .",
    "the open symbols in figure  [ figs : oblate ] illustrate the well known result that rotation plays an important role in faint ellipticals ( open triangles ) and that rotational support becomes increasingly weak with luminosity .",
    "the importance of rotation in the simulated galaxy is somewhat unexpected , as it is usually taken to imply that a large fraction of the stars have formed following a smooth dissipative collapse . in this case , however , the formation of @xmath148 of the stars predate the final major ( @xmath2:@xmath3 ) merger at @xmath1 which transforms the two progenitor disks into a spheroid .",
    "only @xmath149 of the stars form during the merger event .",
    "simple oblate rotators can apparently form even under circumstances as inauspicious as a major merger .",
    "the reason why the merger remnant structure is so kinematically simple  despite its violent assembly history  appears to be linked to couplings between the internal structure of the progenitor disks and the orbital parameters of the merger .",
    "indeed , both disks rotate prograde relative to the orbit of the encounter , and their inclination with respect to the orbital plane is modest ( @xmath150 in one case , @xmath151 in the other ) .",
    "this reflects a high degree of coherence between scales during the torquing process that endowed the progenitors , as well as the remnant , with net angular momentum .",
    "it is difficult to conclude from a single example whether this cosmologically - induced coincidence between rotation on small and large scales is actually responsible for the structural simplicity of elliptical galaxies .",
    "if confirmed , however , it would help to remove one major objection to the merger model of elliptical galaxy formation : that dissipationless mergers lead to highly triaxial remnants with kinematic structure too peculiar to be consistent with observation ( barnes 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "a formation scenario where major mergers play an important role in the formation of all spheroid - dominated galaxies , and where the amount of dissipation involved decreases systematically with luminosity appears thus a viable way of accounting for the gross morphological and dynamical properties of ellipticals .      , measuring isophotal deviations from perfect ellipses , plotted as a function of projected radius for the same @xmath136 projections shown in figure  [ figs : velmap ] .",
    "low inclination angles , corresponding to when the galaxy is seen nearly face - on , are characterized by `` boxy '' ( @xmath152 ) isophotes , a trend that reverses for higher inclinations .",
    "predominantly `` disky '' ( @xmath153 ) isophotes are seen when the galaxy is projected nearly edge - on . [",
    "figs : a4prof ] ]    although the isophotes shown in figure  [ figs : velmap ] are well approximated by ellipses , small but significant deviations from perfect ellipsoidal shapes are also robustly measured .",
    "of particular interest is the @xmath154 parameter , which measures @xmath155 deviations from perfect ellipses : @xmath152 signals `` boxy '' isophotes whereas @xmath153 imply `` disky '' deviations from perfect ellipses ( bender & mllenhoff 1987 ) .",
    "observationally , there is a clear trend between @xmath154 and the degree to which the galaxy s shape is supported by rotation .",
    "disky isophotes are typically associated with fast rotators , whereas boxy ellipticals are most often those exhibiting little rotation ( see , e.g. , open symbols in figure  [ figs : a4vsig ] ) .",
    "given that rotational support decreases with luminosity (   [ sssec : shaperot ] ) it is somewhat surprising that @xmath154 correlates only weakly with luminosity , as seen in figure  [ figs : a4 mb ] .",
    "one reason for this is that a number of fast - rotating ellipticals have boxy isophotes , apparently at odds with the simple interpretation that disky isophotes are the result of a dissipative collapse phase responsible for the galaxy s rotational support .",
    "parameter at the effective radius , plotted versus the rotational parameter @xmath156 defined as the ratio between @xmath7 and the value corresponding to an oblate rotator of the same apparent ellipticity .",
    "solid squares correspond to the same @xmath136 projections of the simulated galaxy shown in figure  [ figs : velmap ] .",
    "open symbols correspond to observed ellipticals from the sample of bender et al .",

    "<S> we examine the dynamical structure of an elliptical galaxy simulated in the @xmath0cdm scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the galaxy evolves dramatically over time in response to the mode and timing of mass accretion ; smooth deposition of cooled gas leads to the formation of centrifugally supported disks , whilst major mergers disperse stellar disks into spheroids . in the case we consider here , these two modes of accretion alternate successively until @xmath1 , when the galaxy undergoes one last major ( @xmath2:@xmath3 ) merger . </S>",
    "<S> the event triggers a starburst that consumes much of the remaining gas into stars . </S>",
    "<S> little gas cools and accretes subsequently and , as a result , most stars at @xmath4 are rather old ( @xmath5 are older than @xmath6 gyr ) , and distributed in a spheroidal component that resembles present - day elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> dynamically , the galaxy is well approximated by an e4 oblate rotator , with rotational support increasing steadily from the center outwards . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent rotation support , as measured by @xmath7 , correlates strongly with isophotal deviations from perfect ellipses . </S>",
    "<S> boxy isophotes are obtained when the galaxy is seen face - on and @xmath8 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> disky isophotes are found for inclinations which maximize @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the line - of - sight velocity distribution is nearly gaussian at all radii , although small but significant deviations are robustly measured . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the gauss - hermite skewness parameter @xmath9 is anti - correlated with the apparent sense of rotation , in agreement with observed trends . despite its relatively recent assembly , the simulated galaxy has much higher effective surface brightness than normal ellipticals of similar luminosity , in a way reminiscent of the less common type of m32-like `` compact ellipticals '' . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely a direct consequence of our star formation and feedback algorithm , which allows for efficient transformation of gas into stars in dense , early collapsing progenitors rather than a definitive prediction for the structure of galaxies assembled in this @xmath0cdm halo . despite this limitation </S>",
    "<S> , our simulation suggests that dark matter plays a minor role in the luminous regions of compact ellipticals , whose dynamical mass - to - light ratios are thus not dissimilar to those of normal ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the proximity of compact ellipticals to edge - on projections of the fundamental plane , despite their far greater velocity dispersion at given luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our simulation shows that repeated episodes of dissipational collapse , followed by merger events , lead to stellar spheroids that are only mildly triaxial and of relatively simple kinematic structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is in better agreement with observation than earlier models based on dissipationless mergers of stellar disks , and a positive step towards reconciling the observed structure of ellipticals with a hierarchical assembly process where mergers play a substantial role . </S>"
