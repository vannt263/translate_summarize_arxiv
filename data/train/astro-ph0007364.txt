    "it is now realized that the disks of spiral galaxies display a rich variety of non - axisymmetry in their light and hence mass distribution .",
    "lopsided galaxies such as m 101 and ngc 1637 show a global asymmetry , with a much larger spatial extent on one side than on the other , as seen optically ( sandage 1961 ) , and particularly strongly in the atomic hydrogen gas ( baldwin , lynden - bell , & sancisi 1980 ) .",
    "thus the disk mass distribution in these is characterized by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the harmonic number or the azimuthal number of the fourier component being studied . for the elliptical case ( @xmath7 ) , similar globally asymmetric distributions with a constant phase with radius",
    "are not easy to discern .",
    "this is because it is difficult to separate the projection effects from the intrinsic ellipticity of the disk , and hence this needs a careful photometric study of nearly face - on galaxies as done for example by rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath8 spiral features with a phase varying with radius say as in m 81 or m 51 ( sandage 1961 ) are well studied , and indeed are responsible for the ` spiral ' nomenclature for these galaxies .",
    "these earlier studies were done in the blue - band , and hence the features show a much stronger contrast than the asymmetry in the underlying stellar mass distribution which is harder to measure .",
    "recent near - ir observations allow one to measure the mass asymmetry in the underlying , old stellar disk population ( block et al .",
    "1994 , rix & zaritsky 1995 , zaritsky & rix 1997 , rudnick & rix 1998 , kornreich , haynes & lovelace 1998 ) .",
    "rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) have given a quantitative measure of the amplitudes of the components with various harmonic numbers and their radial variations .",
    "the amplitudes of the higher harmonics ( @xmath9 ) are observed to be generally smaller than those for @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the asymmetry at a higher radius beyond the optical disk or the holmberg radius is better studied using the hi as a tracer as shown for the @xmath12 case , with mapping ( baldwin et al .",
    "1980 ) and with the global velocity profiles ( richter & sancisi 1994 ; haynes et al .",
    "the disk asymmetry can also be deduced from the kinematic study of the hi velocity field observations ( schoenmakers , franx , & de zeeuw 1997 ) .    despite the small value of the observed disk asymmetry of a few %",
    ", it is becoming an interesting topic for study since the disk asymmetry is tied into the asymmetry of the halo and indeed provides a quantitative measure or diagnostic of the halo asymmetry .",
    "this is because the global asymmetry in the disk is attributed as a response to the halo distortion ( e.g. , weinberg 1995 , jog 1997 ) .",
    "thus the halo asymmetry can be deduced from the observed isophotal ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ) , or the kinematic ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ) disk asymmetry .",
    "binney ( 1978 ) first proposed that a galaxy halo would be non - axisymmetric / triaxial , and studied its effect on the embedded disk .",
    "the halo asymmetry could arise either due to tidal interactions between galaxies ( wienberg 1995 ) , or the triaxiality of the halo could be attributed to the galaxy formation process itself ( e.g. , dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; also see binney 1996 , and rix 1996 ) .",
    "thus the measurement of the disk asymmetry allows one to constrain the details of galaxy formation mechanisms .    since the disk and halo in a galaxy overlap and",
    "interact with each other gravitationally , the non - axisymmetry in one structural component will affect that in the other .",
    "in the inner galaxy , inside of the holmberg radius , the disk constitutes a significant part of the total mass of the galaxy , and the disk self - gravity can result in a substantial decrease in the net non - axisymmetry of the halo potential as shown for @xmath5 by jog ( 1999 ) .",
    "physically this is because the disk self - gravity resists change and thus leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the net lopsided potential in the galactic plane . in this paper",
    ", we study a similar self - consistent , negative disk response to higher order halo perturbations ( @xmath13 ) , and discuss the implications of our results for observations . a similar opposing disk response for @xmath8 has been mentioned by rix ( 1996 ) , and the decrease in ellipticity of the potential has been estimated approximately by binney ( 1996 ) . here",
    "we study this effect quantitatively , and self - consistently , and find that the typical reduction in the elliptical potential is @xmath3 .",
    "the orbits in a @xmath8 and @xmath14 perturbation potential are calculated using the first - order epicyclic theory , and the density response of the disk is obtained (  2 ) .",
    "further , the self - gravitational potential corresponding to the self - consistent density response of the disk to the halo potential is obtained by applying to @xmath15 and @xmath11 the general formalism developed by jog ( 1999 ) (  2 ) .",
    "the reduction factor for the halo potential due to the self - gravity of the disk is obtained for a wide range of galaxy parameters , including for the milky way , and the ` true ' halo asymmetry is obtained (  3 ) . ",
    "4 contains a discussion of a few general points , and the conclusions from this paper are summarized in  5 .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion for closed orbits , and the density response of these , in an azimuthally symmetric galactic disk perturbed by a non - axisymmetric halo potential , and also obtain their relation to the isophotal shapes in an exponential disk ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this is analogous to the lopsided case ( @xmath12 ) studied by jog ( 1997 ) .",
    "we use the galactic cylindrical co - ordinates @xmath16 .    the unperturbed potential for the axisymmetric galactic disk , @xmath17 , at a given radius @xmath18",
    "is chosen to be a logarithmic potential which is applicable for a region of flat rotation , with @xmath19 being the constant rotational velocity :    @xmath20    the non - axisymmetric perturbation halo potentials @xmath21 and @xmath22 corresponding to the @xmath0 and @xmath11 components are respectively chosen to be :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are small , constant perturbation parameters , and @xmath26 is the azimuthal angle in the plane of the disk .",
    "note that the ellipticity , or the elongation , of the potential in the plane is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively for the @xmath0 and @xmath11 cases .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath29 , of the perturbation potential ( eq.[2 ] ) is assumed to be constant with radius for simplicity , as in franx & de zeeuw ( 1992 ) , and rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) .",
    "this assumption is physically reasonable for a global distortion of a halo as in a triaxial halo potential ( see  1 ) .",
    "we have also assumed the phase of the perturbation potential to be constant with radius for simplicity , as was done by rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) for @xmath30 , and by jog ( 1997 ) for @xmath5 .",
    "this is also justified for a global halo distortion assumed .",
    "the unperturbed surface brightness of a typical galactic disk is observed to have an exponential dependence on radius ( freeman 1970 ) . assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio for the disk",
    ", this gives the unperturbed mass surface density , @xmath31 , of the stellar disk to be :    @xmath32     \\eqno ( 3)\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the central extrapolated surface density , and @xmath34 is the scale length of the exponential disk .    for the perturbed case due to the non - axisymmetric potential",
    ", the resulting isophote will be elongated along the same axis as the perturbed orbit , as argued by franx & de zeeuw ( 1992 ) . since the perturbed orbit , @xmath35 , is proportional to @xmath36 ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "[ a6 ] for @xmath0 ) , the resulting effective surface density for the perturbed orbits in an exponential disk can be defined ( see rix & zaritsky 1995 , jog 1997 ) to be :    @xmath37\\ ] ]    @xmath38 \\ :      exp   [   ( a_m / a_0 ) \\ : cos m \\phi ] \\ :   \\eqno ( 4)\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the ellipticity of an isophote at r for @xmath0 and @xmath40 respectively , and @xmath41 is the fractional amplitude of the @xmath6th azimuthal fourier component of the disk surface brightness . note that for small perturbations , this choice reproduces the definition of @xmath39 ( eq.[a12 ] ) , as required .",
    "the second relation on the r.h.s of equation ( 4 ) follows from the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath41 ( eq . [ a13 ] ) for an exponential disk .",
    "thus , the change in the surface density , @xmath42 , resulting from the response of the disk to the perturbation halo potential is given by subtracting @xmath31 , the unperturbed surface density ( eq . [ 3 ] ) , from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and for small perturbations we obtain the density response for @xmath43 to be respectively :    @xmath44_m \\ : = \\ : \\mu_{un } ( r ) \\ :      \\left (   \\frac { a_m}{a_{0 } }     \\ : cos m \\ : \\phi   \\right )     \\eqno ( 5)\\ ] ]    thus , the disk response density is linearly proportional to @xmath41 or to the perturbation parameter , @xmath45 ( see eq .",
    "[ a15 ] ) , as expected from the linear perturbation theory used in this paper .",
    "note that the response density is maximum along @xmath46 , along which the magnitude of the perturbation halo potential is also a maximum .",
    "this result will be valid for any self - gravitating , centrally concentrated realistic disk mass distribution .",
    "the self - gravitational potential @xmath48 ( r , @xmath26 , z ) for a general , nonaxisymmetric , thin disk with a surface density @xmath49 ( r , @xmath26 , z ) was obtained by jog ( 1999 ) .",
    "this was obtained by solving the poisson equation using the inversion technique involving the hankel transforms of the potential - density pairs .",
    "the expression for the nonaxisymmetric potential for the thin disk is ( see eq . [ 22 ] from jog 1999 ) :    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the cylindrical bessel function of the first kind , of order @xmath6 .",
    "we apply this to the disk response density , @xmath53_m$ ] for @xmath0 and @xmath40 ( eq . [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the resulting potential defines the response potential , @xmath54_m$ ] , respectively for @xmath8 and @xmath55 .",
    "we consider the potential in the plane of the disk , so that @xmath56 .",
    "consider the case @xmath57 first .",
    "since the density response is proportional to @xmath58 ; only the values of @xmath59 need to be kept in the integral over @xmath26 on the right hand side of equation ( 6 ) , because only the contribution from these terms is non - zero .",
    "further , since @xmath58 is an even function of @xmath26 , and since @xmath60 ; hence the terms for @xmath0 and @xmath61 contribute equally to the integral .",
    "on substituting from equation ( a15 ) for @xmath62 in terms of @xmath63 , the expression for the response potential , @xmath64 , simplifies to :    @xmath65    @xmath66    the second integral over @xmath67 can be solved using the relation ( 6.623.1 ) from gradshteyn & reyzhik ( 1980 ) .",

    "similarly , the disk response would be negative for any self - gravitating , centrally concentrated disk . following a similar analysis ,",
    "the response potential @xmath78 , is obtained for @xmath14 , see appendix b for details .",
    "next , define @xmath79 to be a dimensionless quantity as :    @xmath80    note that this is independent of the strength of the imposed perturbation potential , and depends linearly only on @xmath81 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath82 in equation ( 8) when solved analytically give terms involving hypergeometric series which need to be calculated numerically .",
    "instead , equation ( 8) is directly solved numerically , and while doing this @xmath83 is obtained using a specific program ( press et al .",

    "this follows from the form of the response potential ( eq.[6 ] ) , which involves a double integral over the bessel function @xmath89 which decreases monotonically with @xmath6 for a particular argument @xmath82 .",
    "second , the maximum of @xmath85 occurs at a lower radius with increasing @xmath6 . _",
    "the maximum occurs _ at a radius = 1.42 @xmath34 for @xmath0 and 1.17 @xmath34 for @xmath40 . for the corrected equations of motion for @xmath90 ( see appendix a ) , the maximum occurs at 1.98 @xmath34 which is slightly larger than the radius of 1.4 @xmath34 obtained in jog ( 1999 ) .",
    "this radial dependence is a robust result valid for any exponential disk , and is independent of the actual values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the observational consequences of this result will be discussed in  @xmath91 4 .",
    "a particle in the disk will be affected by the imposed halo potential and also the disk response potential .",
    "we follow the approach of jog ( 1999 ) which gave a self - consistent calculation for @xmath92 . thus , for a self - consistent case",
    ", the net nonaxisymmetric perturbation potential , @xmath93 , in the disk plane is given by the sum of the perturbation halo potential ( eq . [ 2 ] ) , and the self - gravitational potential , @xmath94 , which corresponds to the disk response to the net potential , @xmath95 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath96    in analogy with the disk response to the disk potential alone ( eq . [ 9 ] ) , the net self - consistent response potential @xmath97 is given to be :    @xmath98    on substituting this in equation ( 11 ) , we get    @xmath99    next , define the reduction factor , @xmath100 , to be :    @xmath101    here @xmath102 is the reduction or scaling factor by which the magnitude of @xmath103 is reduced due to the self - consistent , negative disk response . note that since @xmath79 is a positive definite quantity , hence @xmath104 . that is , the magnitude of the net perturbation potential is always smaller than the magnitude of the imposed halo perturbation potential . for @xmath105 ,",
    "there is no reduction and the disk response @xmath106 as expected .",
    "the reduction factor @xmath100 at a given radius @xmath107 _ is independent of the strength of the perturbation potential _ and hence of @xmath108 , and it depends inversely on @xmath79 and hence inversely on @xmath109 .",
    "we will obtain the actual values of @xmath100 in  3.2 .",
    "@xmath110 will be a minimum at a radius where @xmath79 is a maximum , that is at 1.42 and 1.17 @xmath107 for @xmath30 and @xmath11 respectively ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "observations of @xmath41 , the fractional amplitude of the @xmath116 azimuthal fourier component of the surface brightness , will yield the parameter @xmath111 . here",

    "of equation ( a7 ) .",
    "the values of the true ellipticity ( @xmath120 ) will be obtained in  3.3 .",
    "the value of the reduction factor @xmath121 ( eq.[14 ] ) is obtained numerically and its variation with the galaxy morphological type , size , and radius in the galactic disk , and the component @xmath6 , is studied for the classical large or giant spiral galaxies .",
    "the values of the typical disk parameters for the giant spiral galaxies are taken to be : @xmath33 , the central surface mass density @xmath122 ; @xmath34 , the exponential disk scale length @xmath123 ; and a range of values of the maximum rotation velocity , @xmath19 , for a flat rotation curve are taken to be equal to 200 , 250 , and 300 @xmath124 .",
    "see jog ( 1999 ) for a discussion supporting the choice of these values .",
    "figure 2 contains a plot of the reduction factor , @xmath125 , by which the elliptical halo potential is reduced due to the negative response of the disk ( eq . [ 14 ] ) , vs. @xmath126 .",
    "note that the reduction factor is a minimum at @xmath127 and increases thereafter , as expected from equation ( 14 ) ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the typical minimum value of @xmath128 lies in the range of 0.75 - 0.9 , and @xmath129 is larger for galaxies with a larger value of @xmath19 .",
    "a similar plot of @xmath130 versus radius ( not shown here ) gives the minimum value of @xmath130 to be higher , in the range of @xmath131 .",
    "thus the reduction due to the disk self - gravity in the perturbation halo potential is not important for @xmath132 , and for the higher values of the harmonic @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath2 , the observed asymmetry in the disk response represents the true halo asymmetry .    for the corrected equations of motion for the lopsided case ( @xmath133 ,",
    "see appendix a ) , the resulting minimum in @xmath128 is found to span a range of 0.67 - 0.82 and it occurs at a radius of @xmath134 .",
    "these are slightly different from the results of jog ( 1999 ) , mainly in the peak radius which was earlier obtained to be @xmath135 .",
    "note , however , that the correct results obtained here are still in good agreement with the observed radial variation in the net lopsided distribution , which was a main result of jog ( 1999 ) .",
    "next consider the special case of a giant spiral galaxay , namely , the milky way galaxy .",
    "we assume a flat rotation curve with @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , and @xmath138 as discussed above for the giant galaxies .",
    "the plots of @xmath139 and @xmath140 vs. @xmath126 are given in figure 3 .",
    "several quantitative resuls follow from this . first , the minimum values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 are 0.75 and 0.88 respectively .",
    "second , @xmath139 is @xmath141 in the solar neighborhood of @xmath142 , which is @xmath143 .",
    "this is almost twice the value of @xmath144 for the reduction in the ellipticity estimated from an order - of - magnitude calculation by binney ( 1996 ) . because of the general formulation in our paper , figure 2 gives the reduction factor as a function of radius for @xmath0 for a variety of galaxy parameters .",
    "third , if the halo of our galaxy has an elliptical halo potential , then the disk response would reduce this potential at most by a factor of @xmath145 .",
    "thus for the observed values of the disk parameters for the galaxy and also the other galaxies , while the negative disk response can not be ignored , it can never totally cancel or counteract the imposed elliptical halo potential in the disk plane .",
    "this is contrary to the suggestion by binney ( 1996 ) that at high enough disk to halo mass ratio , the galaxy could be treated as axisymmetric .",
    "the true ellipticity of the halo potential is an important physical property , possibly related to the process of galaxy formation (  1 ) , and attempts have been made in the literature to estimate this from the observational data on disks of galaxies .",
    "the resulting values span a large range . the optical data on the elongation in the disk yield typical estimate of ellipticity for the halo of spirals to be 0.1 ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ) , while a value of 0.045 is obtained by a similar analysis of the near - infrared study of a smaller sample of 18 galaxies ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ) . from detailed kinematical studies ,",
    "an ellipticity of 0.1 is obtained for the milky way galaxy ( kuijken & tremaine 1994 ) , and for ngc 2403 and ngc 3198 this is estimated respectively to be 0.064 and 0.019 ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "1997 ) . from the scatter in the tully - fisher relation ,",
    "the halo ellipticity is estimated to be 0.1 ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 ) .",
    "the observations measure the net ellipticity , @xmath146 , while the @xmath147 ellipticity of the halo potential , given by @xmath148 , is higher by a factor of @xmath149 ( eq.[16 ] ) . since the typical minimum value of @xmath150 is 0.8 ( figure 2 ) ,",
    "the true ellipticity is higher by 20 % than the measured net value .",
    "thus , for the above observed typical range of net ellipticity of @xmath151 in the literature , the true halo ellipticity is in the range of 0.056 - 0.12 .",
    "this is an important new physical result from our work .",
    "of course , the above estimates would have substantial error bars due to the contamination by the spiral arms or a central bar .",
    "note that the reduction factor @xmath152 at large @xmath153 ( figs",
    ". 2 - 3 ) , or about twice the holmberg radius . hence the true halo ellipticity can be directly sampled by studying the tracer at larger radii namely atomic hydrogen gas .",
    "this was done in the plane of ic 2006 ( franx , van gorkom , & de zeeuw 1994 ) , and the halo was found to be axisymmetric .",
    "the ellipticity perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disk could be obtained by studying the polar ring galaxies as suggested by rix ( 1996 ) .",
    "\\1 . the net nonaxisymmetry in the disk will only manifest beyond the radius where the magnitude of the disk repsonse potential is a maximum , and its magnitude will increase with radius as seen from the definition of @xmath110 (  3.1 ) , and this radius is larger for a lower @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates the increasing relative dynamical importance of halo over the disk at large radii .",
    "therefore , if the halo distortion is constant or increasing with radius , then the disk lopsidedness ( @xmath154 ) would be seen only in the outer disk while the higher - order nonaxisymmetric features could be seen farther in the disk .",
    "however , the radial variation for @xmath155 in the inner / optical region will be affected by spiral arms , and bars .",
    "hence the radial variation in @xmath156 components can not be given clearly , in contrast to the @xmath12 case where a clear minimum radial distance was predicted for the detection of @xmath12 global features ( jog 1999 , also ",
    "3.2 ) .    \\2",
    "in addition to the disk response to the global perturbation in the halo as studied in this paper , there could also be @xmath0 or @xmath40 modes generated directly in the disk , say due to gravitational instabilitites .",
    "these would typically have a strong phase variation with radius and hence be detected as the standard two - armed or three - armed spiral features respectively .",
    "only future detailed simulations of tidal interactions on lines of wienberg ( 1995 ) will tell us about the strength as well as the phase and the radial dependence of the true halo non - axisymmetry of the various @xmath6 components . since there is no inner lindblad resonance for @xmath157 in a typical galactic a disk ( e.g. , block et al .",
    "1994 ) , the @xmath12 component may dominate in the non - linear regime .",
    "the negative disk response decreases the net asymmetry of the potential in the galactic plane , and this would affect the further evolution of the galaxy",
    ". this could be one reason why numerical simulations with a higher mass concentration in the form of a disk show a decrease in the halo ellipticity ( dubinski 1994 ) .",
    "thus the negative feedback due to the self - gravity of the disk highlighted in this paper should be included in future studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "the present paper shows that the disk can not be treated as a collection of massless test particles - doing so would overestimate the disk reponse .",
    "we have calculated the self - consistent disk response for an axisymmetric galactic disk perturbed by a non - axisymmetric halo potential with elliptical and higher - harmonic perturbations ( @xmath30 and @xmath11 ) :    \\1 .",
    "the self - gravitational potential of the self - consistent density response of a galactic disk is calculated and this is shown to oppose the perturbation potential .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the net non - axisymmetric potential in the galactic disk plane is always reduced compared to that of the perturbation potential .",
    "this reduction is denoted by a factor , @xmath110 , which is found to be independent of the strength of the perturbation potential .",
    "the reduction factor , @xmath158 , is obtained for a wide range of galaxy parameters , including for the milky way .",
    "it has a minimum value of @xmath1 , which is insensitive to the morphological type and size of the galaxy .",
    "the reduction is most significant at 1.4 disk scale lengths and is less important at higher radii .",
    "beyond twice the holmberg radius , the reduction is negligible and the atomic hydrogen gas can be used to trace the true ellipticity of the halo potential . in the solar neighborhood of the milky way , the elliptical halo potential is decreased by a factor of @xmath159 due to the disk self - gravity .",
    "the reduction is negligible for the higher harmonics ( @xmath160 ) of the halo potential .",
    "the asymmetric disk response in @xmath2 therefore represents the true halo asymmetry .",
    "\\3 . on correcting for the negative disk response , the _ true _ ellipticity of the halo potential for a typical spiral galaxy",
    "is shown to be higher by @xmath3 than the halo ellipticity of @xmath161 deduced in the literature from observations of isophotal or kinematical asymmetry of disks .",
    "the negative disk response due to the disk self - gravity is shown to be always significant in decreasing the strength of the non - axisymmetric halo potential .",
    "hence the galactic disk in a realistic galaxy can not be treated as a collection of massless test particles . yet",
    ", the negative disk response in a real galactic disk is found to be never large enough to completely obliterate the effect of the halo ellipticity .",
    "i would like to thank the anonymous referee for comments that led to a clearer presentation of material in section 2 , and the appendix a.",
