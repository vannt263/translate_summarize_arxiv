    "though percolation represents the simplest model of a disordered system , it has many applications , e.g. , polymerization , porous and amorphous materials , thin films , spreading of epidemics etc .",
    "in particular the transport properties of percolation clusters have gained a vast amount of interest over the last decades .",
    "random resistor networks ( rrn ) are a prominent model for transport on percolation clusters . by means of rrn one can study the conductivity of disordered media which might be important for technical applications .",
    "nonlinear random resistor networks , for which the voltage drop over an individual resistor depends on some power of the current flowing through it , can be exploited to derive various fractal dimensions of percolation clusters . from the conceptual point of view , rrn have the advantage that one can formulate a field theoretic hamiltonian amenable to renormalization group analysis . via rrn",
    "one can learn about diffusion on disordered substrates , since the diffusion constant @xmath8 and the conductivity @xmath9 of the system are related by the einstein relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the charge and the density of the mobile particles .",
    "the connection of the two problems is particularly important , since up to date no direct approach to diffusion on percolation clusters by means of a dynamic field theory exists .    in this paper",
    "we study the distribution of currents in rrn .",
    "the current distribution has many interesting features , one of which is multifractality@xcite .",
    "this means that the distribution is not controlled by one or two relevant length scales , but rather by an infinite hierarchy of such length scales .",
    "the concept of multifractality was introduced for turbulence@xcite .",
    "it has been applied successfully in diverse areas including diffusion near fractals@xcite , electrons in disordered media@xcite , polymers in disordered media@xcite , random ferromagnets@xcite , chaotic dissipative systems@xcite , and heartbeat@xcite .    due to the multifractality infinitely many exponents are needed to characterize the current distribution .",

    "an elegant approach for studying the multifractal moments is to consider rrn with microscopic noise , i.e. , random networks in which the conductances of the individual resistors fluctuate about some mean .",

    "the contributions to the hamiltonian leading to multifractal behavior contain powers of replica space gradients analog to powers of real space gradients , which were accounted for as an origin of multifractality by duplantier and ludwig@xcite .",
