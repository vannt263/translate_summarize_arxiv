    "our approach is a variation of zeilberger s holonomic ansatz for evaluating determinants , which we recall in the following , for sake of self - containedness .",
    "in  @xcite , zeilberger proposed an algorithmic approach for evaluating and/or producing rigorous proofs of determinant evaluations of the form @xmath1 ( we use checked letters here to avoid confusion with the quantities introduced in section  [ sec.pfaffians ] ) .",

    "but in order to turn identities   into routinely provable tasks , zeilberger additionally requires that the matrix entries  @xmath7 constitute a bivariate holonomic sequence and that the ratios of two consecutive determinants @xmath8 form a univariate holonomic ( p - finite ) sequence ( in other words , @xmath9 is required to be what one could call _ hyper - holonomic _ ) .",
    "this is the reason why he termed his approach the _ holonomic ansatz _  @xcite .",
    "but still , even if all these conditions are satisfied , zeilberger s holonomic ansatz is not guaranteed to succeed , because it relies on the fact that the auxiliary function  @xmath2 ( that is , the cofactors of the laplace expansion with respect to the last row of the @xmath10 matrix , divided by the determinant of the @xmath11 matrix ) turns out to be holonomic , too .",
    "this may be the case or not . if one is lucky , i.e. , if @xmath2 satisfies sufficiently many linear recurrence equations with polynomial coefficients and therefore is holonomic , then the holonomic machinery will produce a p - finite recurrence for the sum on the left - hand side of  .",
    "such a recurrence can then be used to prove a ( conjectured ) determinant evaluation  @xmath9 by substituting the ratio  @xmath12 into this recurrence and comparing initial values , or even , if the recurrence is not too complicated , to solve it explicitly and obtain a closed form for the determinant .    for a more detailed description and justification of the holonomic ansatz ,",

    "we also recommend the beautiful essay  @xcite for the reader who is interested in determinant and pfaffian evaluations in general .    in the present paper , we introduce a variation of zeilberger s method that is tailored particularly for pfaffians .",

    "the main difference is that now the free parameter  @xmath119 is involved , which on the one hand makes the computations and the intermediate results more voluminous . on the other hand , some arguments in the proof (",
    "like `` the leading coefficient of some recurrence is never zero '' ) become more intricate .",
    "one solution to address the latter issue is to argue that @xmath119 is a formal parameter ; then any polynomial in @xmath119 which is not identically zero , is considered to be nonzero ( as an element in the corresponding polynomial ring ) .",
    "if one feels uneasy about this argument , one can as well try to find conditions under which all steps of the proof are sound ; for our reasoning the assumption @xmath120 was sufficient .",
    "hence the evaluation is proven only for @xmath120 .",
    "but for specific  @xmath4 , the pfaffian is a polynomial in  @xmath119 ( of a certain degree ) , as well as the evaluation on the right - hand side of  .",

    "<S> a variation of zeilberger s holonomic ansatz for symbolic determinant evaluations is proposed which is tailored to deal with pfaffians . </S>",
    "<S> the method is also applicable to determinants of skew - symmetric matrices , for which the original approach does not work . </S>",
    "<S> as zeilberger s approach is based on the laplace expansion ( cofactor expansion ) of the determinant , we derive our approach from the cofactor expansion of the pfaffian . to demonstrate the power of our method , we prove , using computer algebra algorithms , some conjectures proposed in the paper `` pfaffian decomposition and a pfaffian analogue of @xmath0-catalan hankel determinants '' by ishikawa , tagawa , and zeng . a minor summation formula related to partitions and motzkin paths follows as a corollary .    </S>",
