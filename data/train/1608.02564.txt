    "<S> we describe the moduli compactification by stable pairs of a @xmath0-dimensional family of enriques surfaces , which arise as the @xmath1-cover of the blow up of @xmath2 at three general points branched along a configuration of six lines . </S>",
    "<S> the divisor is chosen to be an appropriate multiple of the ramification locus . </S>",
    "<S> we study the degenerations parametrized by the boundary and its stratification , which has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the polyhedral subdivisions of the unit cube . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we relate this compactification to the baily - borel compactification of the same @xmath0-dimensional family of enriques surfaces . </S>"
