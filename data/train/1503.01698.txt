    "within the past two years , three neutron star binaries , psr j1824@xmath02452i in m28 @xcite , psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite , and xss j12270@xmath04859 @xcite , have been observed to switch between accreting and rotation - powered pulsar states .",
    "these discoveries have confirmed the standard model for the formation of rotation - powered millisecond pulsars ( msps ) via spin - up by accretion in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .    the two confirmed transitional msps in the field of the galaxy , psr j1023 + 0038 and xss j12270@xmath04859 , exhibit strong @xmath3-ray emission in _ fermi _ large area telescope data even during their accreting states .",
    "this implies that other similar objects may be hiding among the unidentified _ fermi _ lat sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for the case of 1fgl j1417.7@xmath04407 ) .",
    "while targeted radio pulsation searches of _ fermi _ lat sources have proven to be particularly fruitful for discovering new rotation - powered msps , yielding at least 38 published discoveries to date , transitional objects may elude detection at radio frequencies since the pulsar emission mechanism appears to be extinguished when an accretion disk is present in the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    in their low - luminosity ( @xmath1@xmath4erg s@xmath5 in the soft x - ray band ) accreting states , psr j1023 + 0038 , xss j12270@xmath04859 , and psr j18242452i exhibit sudden , unpredictable drops in flux and occasional intense flares @xcite .",
    "this characteristic x - ray behavior is a unique signature that can be used to identify additional transition systems and distinguish them from other varieties of accreting objects such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "we have identified a particularly promising candidate for an lmxb / msp transition object , namely , 3fgl j1544.6@xmath01125 , previously known as 2fgl j1544.5@xmath01126 . the only x - ray - bright object within the 95% confidence error ellipse of this 3fgl source is the _ rosat _ source 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 @xcite .",
    "optical identification of _ rosat_-selected candidates for unassociated _ fermi _ lat sources by @xcite revealed this object to have an optical spectrum in 2012 consistent with those of accretion - disk - dominated systems , with prominent emission lines of h and he . on this basis , it was classified as a cv and was dismissed as the counterpart of 3fgl j1544.6@xmath01125 because no cvs are known to exhibit persistent @xmath3-ray emission . however , given the fact that both psr j1023 + 0038 and xss j122704859 were mis - classified as cvs upon their discovery suggests that similar objects may also be masquerading as cvs . based on this",
    ", we suspected that 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 is indeed the counterpart of the _ fermi _ lat source . here , we present an analysis of x - ray and uv data from _ xmm - newton _ and optical time - series photometry obtained at mdm observatory of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 , which reveal the true nature of this object",

    "to maximize the photon statistics of the data for the variability analysis , we extracted a total exposure - corrected and background - subtracted x - ray light curve of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 by combining the individual mos1/2 and pn time series over the period when the three instruments are collecting data simultaneously .",

    "we carried out a spectroscopic analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ epic data in xspec 12.7.1 @xcite . due to known issues with the spectral calibration of the pn instrument in timing mode , we only considered the mos1/2 data .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 is well - described by a simple absorbed power - law .",

    "fitting the high and low emission separately ( by making a cut at 0.9 counts s@xmath5 in the light curve from figure 2 ) produces @xmath24 and @xmath25 , implying only marginally significant evidence for spectral variations as a function of source brightness . as the distance to 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 is unconstrained",
    ", it is not possible to determine the x - ray luminosity levels of the high and low modes .",
    "although the 30 @xmath10s time resolution of the pn permits the search for x - ray pulsations at millisecond periods , the lack of an orbital period and ephemeris , combined with the relatively low source count rate , render a blind periodicity search infeasible at this time .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 2 shows the _ xmm - newton _ om @xmath12 filter photometric data at a 20 minute resolution , which shows variability by up to @xmath20.5 mag .",
    "a fit with a sinusoid indicates a periodicity of 5.2 hours .",
    "however , it should be noted that the low points in the u filter data may not correspond to a binary modulation as they could be related to the intervals dominated by low mode x - ray emission that occur at the same time . due to the faint nature of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 ,",

    "the magnitude of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  varies from about 18.3 to 19.1 , similar to @xmath27 as listed in the usno b1.0 catalog .",
    "the nature of the optical variability of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  observed at mdm is subtly different from that of most cataclysmic binaries . rather than a random walk or flickering , the brightness appears to be confined between minimum and maximum values separated by @xmath2@xmath28 magnitudes .",
    "this is especially obvious in the higher - quality 2.4 m data . in this regard",
    ", it resembles the limit - cycle behavior occasionally seen from psr j1023 + 1038 , an example of which is shown in figure  [ fig : psrj1023 ] .",
    "there is no obvious candidate for an orbital or any other period in these light curves of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 .",
    "a periodicity search of the longest light curve on 2014 march 23 shows a peak in the power spectrum at @xmath15.4 hours , but this is unreliable because it is comparable to the length of the observation , and it can not be confirmed by any of the shorter time series . in contrast , in all light curves of psr j1023 + 1038 , e.g. , figure  [ fig : psrj1023 ] , its 4.75  hr orbital period is clearly manifest as a modulation due to heating of the side of the companion facing the neutron star .",
    "the catalina real - time transient survey @xcite contains 324 photometric measurements of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  over a span of 7 years .",
    "we searched these for periodicity in the range 124 hours , such as may arise from orbital modulation , but did not find a significant detection .",
    "we have presented an x - ray , uv , and optical investigation of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 , the most likely counterpart of the _ fermi _ lat source 3fgl j1544.6@xmath01125 . when combined with previous studies",
    ", we can establish the following observational properties of the system : i ) strong emission lines of h and he , suggestive of an accretion disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ii ) fast optical variaiblity within limits ; iii ) power - law x - ray emission with @xmath29 that exhibits rapid moding between two distinct x - ray flux levels ; iv ) persistent @xmath3-ray emission with no evidence for a spectral cut - off ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these characteristics are strikingly similar to what is observed for the transitional msps psr j1824@xmath02452i @xcite , psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss j122704859 @xcite in their low - luminosity accreting states . therefore",
    ", 1rxs j154439.4@xmath011282 is the counterpart of 3fgl j1544.6@xmath01125 and is almost certainly a binary that hosts an msp and is presently in a low - luminosity lmxb state .    as argued by @xcite for the case of psr j1023 + 0038",
    ", the @xmath3-ray emission seen by _ fermi _ lat is likely generated in a jet / wind outflow , perhaps driven by propeller - mode accretion .",
    "the peculiar x - ray moding appears to be caused by rapid transitions between channelled accretion onto the neutron star surface ( the high mode ) and no accretion ( the low mode ) . as with psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss j122704859 @xcite",
    ", we predict that 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 should exhibit coherent x - ray pulsations at the neutron star spin period during the high flux mode",
    ". however , due to the lack of a precise orbital ephemeris , at present , a blind periodicity search of the x - ray data is not practical . in the absence of evidence for the orbit of 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820  in either x - ray or optical light curves",
    ", a spectroscopic period should be obtained from its optical emission lines .",
    "this system can serve as an additional laboratory for studying the peculiar phenomenology of transitional msp systems , especially the highly unusual x - ray flux switching , and the relation , if any , with the optical moding we see in 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 . in turn , this may shed light on the little - understood low - luminosity ( `` quiescent '' ) regime in neutron star x - ray binaries .",
    "in addition , extending the presently small sample of transitional msps has important implication for understanding key aspects of the evolution of compact neutron star binaries .",
    "based on the recent history of the three confirmed lmxb / rmsp transition objects , we expect 1rxs j154439.4@xmath0112820 to transform into a disk - free state in which the rotation - powered millisecond pulsar activates .",
    "therefore , this object warrants intensive multi - wavelength monitoring in order to catch such an occurence .",
    "a portion of the results presented were based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "this work used observations obtained at the mdm observatory , operated by dartmouth college , columbia university , ohio state university , ohio university , and the university of michigan .",
    "we have made extensive use of the nasa astrophysics data system ( ads ) and the arxiv ."
