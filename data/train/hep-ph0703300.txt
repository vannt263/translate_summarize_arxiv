    "the standard model ( sm ) based on the local gauge group @xmath1 @xcite , with all its successes , is in the unaesthetic position of having no explanation of several issues such as : hierarchical charged fermion masses , fermion mixing angles , charge quantization , strong cp violation , replication of families , neutrino masses and oscillations  @xcite , etc .. all this make us think that we must call for extensions of the model .",
    "doing physics beyond the sm may imply to introduce a variety of new ingredients such as extra fermion fields ( adding a right - handed neutrino field to each family constitute its simplest extension and has several consequences , as the implementation of the see - saw mechanism for the neutrinos , and the enlarging of the possible number of local abelian symmetries that can be gauged simultaneously ) .",

    "they imply different mass matrices for gauge bosons and fermion fields , with quite a different phenomenology .",
    "the most important fact about our higgs sector is that it allows for a consistent charged fermion mass spectrum , without a strong hierarchy between the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "besides , it allows for the first time in the context of the model , the identification of the quark mass eigenstates , as a function of the weak states . using that information , a consistent phenomenologycal analysis which sets reliable bounds on new physics coming from heavy neutral currents can be done .",
    "as far as the particle spectrum is concerned , let us say that in the scalar sector , and according to the esh  @xcite , at least one more @xmath74 neutral singlet and a second higgs doublet should show up at the electroweak scale , with all the other higgs scalars getting a mass at the tev scale ( the neutral singlet does not couple to the sm fermions at the tree level ) . for the charged fermions , the four exotic quarks ( two up and two down ) and the three exotic electrons should get masses at the 3 - 3 - 1 scale ( 2 tev @xmath19010 tev ) .",
    "some of these particles should show up at the forthcoming lhc facilities .",

    "<S> we also embed the structure into a simple gauge group and show some conditions to achieve a low energy gauge coupling unification , avoiding possible conflict with proton decay bounds . by using experimental results from the cern - lep , slac linear collider , and atomic parity violation data , we update constraints on several parameters of the model . </S>"
