    "the determination of the neutrino mass is an important issue in fundamental physics .",
    "the standard model of particle physics had assumed that all three families of neutrinos : electron neutrinos @xmath8 , muon neutrinos @xmath9 and tau neutrinos @xmath10 are massless , and that the neutrino can not change its flavor from one to another .",
    "however , the results from solar and atmospheric experiments @xcite showed that the flavour of neutrinos could oscillate .",
    "the mixing and oscillating of flavors implies nonzero differences between the neutrino masses , which in turn indicates that the neutrinos have absolute mass .",
    "if the neutrino does have absolute mass , it will be the lowest - energy particle in the extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "however , such observations of flavor oscillations can only show that the neutrinos have mass , and can not exactly pin down the absolute mass scale of neutrinos .",
    "particle physics experiments are able to place lower limits on the effective neutrino mass , which , however , depends on the hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectra@xcite(also see ref.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "on the other hand , cosmological constraints on neutrino properties are highly complementary to particle physics .",
    "massive neutrinos , if above @xmath11 , will become nonrelativistic before recombination@xcite , leaving an impact on the first acoustic peak in the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) temperature angular power spectrum due to the early - time integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect ; neutrinos with mass below @xmath11 will become nonrelativistic after recombination , altering the matter - radiation equality ; the massive neutrino will also suppress the matter power spectrum on small scales , since neutrinos can not cluster below the free - streaming scales  @xcite(see@xcite for reviews ) . combining various cosmological observations can put rather tight constraints on the sum of the neutrino mass .",
    "the most recent measurements from the planck satellite@xcite on the cmb in combination with the baryon acoustic oscillation(bao)@xcite , wmap polarization(wp ) and the high-@xmath4 data on the cmb from the atacama cosmology telescope(act)@xcite and the south pole telescope(spt)@xcite give an upper limit for the sum of the neutrino mass as @xmath12 in the spatially flat @xmath13 model with the effective number of neutrino species as @xmath14 .",
    "it is even more promising that with the upcoming esa euclid mission@xcite in the near future , the neutrino mass can be constrained up to an unprecedented accuracy simply by cosmological observations@xcite .",
    "the allowed neutrino mass window could be closed by forthcoming cosmological observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to recall that the constraints on neutrino properties are usually found within the context of a @xmath15cdm model or within the context of a dark energy model@xcite . considering different cosmological models , degeneracies may arise among neutrinos and other cosmological parameters .",
    "cosmological constraints on neutrino properties are highly model dependent . references@xcite have investigated this issue in the framework of a dark energy model with varying total neutrino mass and number of relativistic species .",

    "this family of @xmath0 models has only one more parameter than the @xmath15cdm model , which can be characterized by @xmath16 which is approximately the squared compton wavelengths in units of the hubble scale  @xcite .",
    "cosmological constraints on these models without taking into account neutrino mass have already been presented in the literature . on linear scales ,",
    "the wmap nine - year data in combination with the matter power spectra of lrg from sdss dr7 data can only put weak constraints on these models : @xmath17@xcite .",
    "tighter constraints can be obtained from the galaxy - isw correlation data , which puts the constraint up to @xmath18@xcite . using the data of cluster abundance ,",
    "the constraints are dramatically improved up to @xmath19 @xcite . however , the tightest constraints so far come from the astrophysical tests@xcite which place the upper bound for @xmath20 as @xmath21 . on the other hand , the cosmological constraints on @xmath0 models taking into account neutrino mass",
    "have also already been presented in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , these works are done within the framework of parameterized gravities . we still need to get more accurate results by solving the full linear perturbation equations in the @xmath0 gravity .    in this paper , we will explore the neutrino properties in @xmath0 gravity based on our modified version of camb code  @xcite , which solves the full linear perturbation equations in the @xmath0 gravity  @xcite .",
