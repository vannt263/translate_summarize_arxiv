    "many aftershocks occur .",
    "omori found that the frequency of aftershocks decays in a power law :  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the elapsed time from the main shock , and the exponent @xmath8 is expected to take a value between 0.9 and 1.4 . in the original omori s law , @xmath8 is set to be 1 .",
    "omori s law implies that the frequency of aftershocks decays slowly or aftershocks can occur even after a rather long time following the main shock .",
    "the mechanisms of earthquakes and aftershocks have been studied by many authors , but are not completely understood .",
    "there are several deterministic models for earthquakes",
    ". the power laws of earthquakes might be understood from the chaotic dynamics of the nonlinear equations .",
    "burridge and knopoff proposed a block - spring model for earthquakes  @xcite .",
    "later , carlson and langer used a type of velocity - weakening friction and found a power law in the small magnitude range  @xcite .",
    "many authors studied intensively the carlson - langer model and its modification .",
    "vieira , vasconcelos , nagel pointed out a transition in the magnitude distribution by changing a parameter of the velocity - weakening friction  @xcite . on the other hand , there are various models in which the power laws originate from the fractal geometry of faults or asperities of plate boundaries .",
    "the size distribution of earthquakes has been explained by several authors using such fractal geometry  @xcite .",
    "we studied the block - spring system on critical percolation clusters with fractal geometry , and showed that the exponent of the power law is about @xmath9 , which is close to the exponent in the original gutenberg - richter law  @xcite .",
    "there are also several stochastic cellular automaton models for earthquakes .",
    "for example , bak and tang proposed a cellular automaton model for earthquakes which exhibits self - organized criticality  @xcite .",
    "olami , feder , and christensen proposed a modified cellular automaton model with some dissipation  @xcite .",
    "the difference between main shocks and aftershocks is not clear in the carlson - langer model or the bak - tang model .",
    "ito and matsuzaki proposed a modified model of bak - tang model and reproduced omori s law for aftershocks by randomly perturbing certain regions that slipped during the main shock  @xcite .",
    "dieterich studied time - dependent friction in rocks and suggested a relationship between the visco - elasticity and omori s law  @xcite .",
    "hainzl et al .",
    "included some visco - elasticity in the olami - feder - christensen model and reproduced a version of omori s law  @xcite .",
    "jagla et al .",
    "studied a depinning model of viscoelastic interfaces and reproduced a type of omori s law  @xcite .",
    "however , the physical meaning of models constructed by ito - matsuzaki and hainzl et al . remains unclear .",
    "jagla s depinning model includes randomness and the relationship between the depinning model and earthquakes is not obvious . in this paper",
    ", we study a modified version of the carlson - langer model with visco - elastic elements , and discuss omori s law of aftershocks .",
    "our model is based on mechanics or newton s equation of motion , and does not include randomness or external noise in contrast to the models by hainzl et al . and jagla et al .",
    "the time evolution is continuous during slip events , but stick intervals between successive slips are theoretically evaluated and numerical simulation for the stick intervals is skipped .",
    "a rather long - time numerical simulation becomes possible owing to the reduction in computation time .",
    "the carlson - langer model is a block - spring model . in a one - dimensional model , @xmath10 blocks of mass @xmath11",
    "are coupled with the nearest neighbor blocks using a spring with a spring constant @xmath12 . in the original model ,",
    "each block is further coupled with a spring to a rigid plate moving with a constant velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the model equation is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the velocity of the block @xmath16 , @xmath12 is the spring constant between neighboring blocks , and @xmath17 represents the kinetic friction .",
    "the maximum static friction is set to be 1 . in the carlson - langer model , the kinetic friction @xmath18 is assumed to be @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 characterize the velocity - weakening friction .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 represents the difference between the maximum static friction 1 and the kinetic friction at the limit of @xmath23 .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath22 are fixed to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 in our numerical simulations for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 expresses the velocity - weakening rate of the kinetic friction , i.e. , @xmath26 at the limit of @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath15 decreases to 0 , the slip state changes to the stick state .",
    "the stick state is assumed to be maintained until the applied force reaches the maximum static friction 1 .",
    "it is assumed that the reverse motion does not occur  @xcite .    in the modified model , a dashpot and spring",
    "are added in parallel to the spring coupled with the rigid plate pulled by velocity @xmath13 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "an additional force @xmath27 is applied to the @xmath28th block by the additional dashpot and spring after the block starts to slip .",
    "the additional force works as a braking force to the slipping block .",
    "various models including viscoelasticity are possible . for example , the dashpot and the spring can be added in parallel to the spring connecting neighboring blocks .",
    "these models might be interesting but we investigate only the simplest model shown in fig .  1 in this paper .",
    "one reason is that the role of the viscoelasticity as a brake force is rather clear and anther reason is that the dynamics in the stick phase is simple and analytically calculated as explained in later paragraphs .",
    "the force satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents the contraction of the additional spring . for a linear dashpot",
    ", the force @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the slip velocity at the dashpot .",
    "because omori s law is not reproduced in a model using the linear dashpot as shown later , we use a more general model where @xmath31 satisfies @xmath34 .",
    "a power - law relation is assumed between the slip velocity and resistance force , and @xmath35 corresponds to the linear dashpot . a power - law model for the relationship between shear velocity and",
    "shear stress is one of the typical models for non - newton fluids .",
    "the power - law model of @xmath36 is applied to non - newton fluids such as polymeric fluids , tooth paste and chocolate .",
    "the slip velocity @xmath37 is expressed as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "the velocity difference between the upper plate and the @xmath28th block is written as @xmath40 which is equal to @xmath41 . then",

    "first , we calculate the maximum value @xmath46 of @xmath47 among the @xmath10 blocks . if the @xmath28th block takes the maximum value , the time is advanced from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the pulling force at the @xmath28th block exceeds the maximum static friction @xmath9 , and the @xmath28th block starts to slip .",
    "the neighboring blocks can slip together owing to the elastic coupling of spring constant @xmath12 .",
    "the time evolution of the slip process obeys eq .",
    "because we assume @xmath13 is infinitesimally small , two slip events do not occur simultaneously in distant places .",
    "when the first slip event ( main shock ) starts , @xmath50 for the block @xmath28 , and @xmath31 becomes negative .",
    "that is , the braking force @xmath31 works for the slipping block .",
    "after the main shock ends and the stick phase starts , the slip velocity @xmath16 becomes zero , then @xmath51 increases toward zero by the last term @xmath52 owing to the effect of the dashpot .",
    "that is , the braking force dampens and the total pulling force to the block tends to increase over time .",
    "it is possible that some blocks start to slip again after a certain time following the main shock .",
    "this is an aftershock .",
    "aftershocks can occur repeatedly .",
    "after the sequence of aftershocks , all @xmath31 s decay to zero .",
    "the period from the start of a main shock and the end of the sequence of aftershocks is one shock event . at the end of the shock event ,",
    "@xmath47 is smaller than 1 and @xmath44 for all @xmath28 s .",
    "then , we again calculate the maximum value @xmath46 of @xmath47 among the @xmath10 blocks , and the upper plate is slowly moved until another block begins to slip .",
    "the time interval @xmath53 until the starting time of the next main shock is calculated by @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the start time of aftershocks in the sequence of aftershocks .",
    "in the stick phase after an aftershock , @xmath55 can be explicitly expressed as @xmath56 for @xmath57 because @xmath58 and @xmath59 after the final time @xmath60 of the aftershock . from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , a possible start time @xmath61 of the next aftershock for the @xmath28th block is evaluated as @xmath62 because @xmath63 at the start time @xmath61 of the next aftershock .",
    "the minimum value @xmath64 of @xmath61 is the actual start time of the next aftershock , and @xmath65 at @xmath66 is evaluated using eq .",
    "if all @xmath67 s are smaller than 1 , the sequence of aftershocks ends . in the case of the linear visco - elasticity : @xmath68 , eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) are replaced by @xmath69 and @xmath70 the equation of motion eq .",

    "( 4 ) is used only in the slip phases , and the time intervals in the stick phases between main shocks or between two aftershocks are theoretically calculated using eq .",
    "( 7 ) or eq .  ( 9 ) .",
    "we performed a numerical simulation repeating these processes .",
    "a characteristic of our model is that a sequence of aftershocks occurs after each main shock and the difference between main shocks and aftershocks is clear . because @xmath13 is assumed to be infinitesimally small , the time of a sequence of aftershocks is infinitesimally small compared with the interval of successive main shocks , which is an order of @xmath71 .",
