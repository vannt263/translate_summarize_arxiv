    "the discovery of the higgs boson with a mass of @xmath3  @xcite and measurements of its properties at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have established the higgs mechanism , on which the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is based . although no clear evidence against the sm has found at collider experiments ,",
    "several phenomena that necessitate a new theory underlying the sm have been reported mainly from the cosmological and astrophysical observations .",
    "these include the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , the baryon asymmetry of the universe , the cosmic inflation as well as neutrino oscillations .",
    "we are obliged to build new models beyond the sm and to develop methods for distinguishing them in order to approach the fundamental theory .    weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xmath4 are ones of the most promising candidates for the dm in our universe",
    ", whose abundance is determined to be @xmath5 by the data obtained at the wmap  @xcite and planck observations  @xcite .",
    "if the thermal relic abundance of the wimps coincides with the observed value above , the energy scale of the new model containing the wimp is set at around the terascale .",
    "therefore , wimp models can be explored by using data obtained at the operative lhc run - ii and the future electron - positron colliders , such as international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite and the future circular collider of electrons and positrons ( fcc - ee )  @xcite , as well as many dm direct and indirect detection experiments .",
    "let us take a closer look at the nature of wimps . as suggested by its name",
    ", wimps appear to have the weak interaction with other sm particles . however , such wimps that couple with the @xmath6-boson have too large annihilation cross sections and scattering cross sections with nuclei .",
    "the latter property completely conflicts with the null results of direct dm search experiments , hence the coupling between the wimp and the @xmath6-boson should be absent or strongly suppressed .",
    "for majorana wimps with the @xmath7 gauge interaction , the coupling with the @xmath6-boson does not exist . for scalar wimps , similarly , introduction of a @xmath8 violating term in the scalar potential",
    "removes the coupling with the @xmath6-boson .",
    "such a prescription is common in order to avoid the direct dm search constraints in the literature , for example , in the inert doublet scalar model  @xcite . on the contrary , @xmath7 singlet wimps , by definition",
    ", do not interact with the @xmath6-boson .",
    "thus , small scattering cross sections with nuclei are predicted , and the direct dm search limit has been relatively easily avoided . as one of the simplest models ,",
    "singlet scalar dm models have been intensively investigated as the operator between real singlet scalar wimp and the sm higgs doublet @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is allowed by renormalizability  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to recent great progress in direct dm search experiments , significant constraints on the coupling @xmath11 have been imposed even for singlet dm . on the other hand ,",
    "small @xmath11 allowed by the direct detection constraints leads to the overabundance of the wimp dm if one relies on the thermal wimp paradigm mentioned above . from the above observations about the wimp coupling with the @xmath6-boson , @xmath7 doublet ( singlet ) wimps",
    "end up with under-(over-)abundance in the universe .",
    "therefore , one can envisage that doublet - singlet mixed wimps may have the correct relic abundance and be consistent with the current direct dm search results simultaneously .",
    "for example , a supersymmetric ( susy ) model in which left - handed and right - handed sneutrinos significantly mix due to the large sneutrino trilinear coupling falls in this category  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phenomenology of scalar - type doublet - singlet mixed dm models as simplified models of the mixed sneutrino dm models : since the quantum numbers of the introduced scalar doublet ( singlet ) in this paper is the same as those of the left - handed sleptons ( right - handed sneutrinos ) , the mixed sneutrino models are reduced to our model if all the other superparticles decouple and susy relations among couplings are relaxed . hence , while our model is strongly motivated by the mixed sneutrino models , differences that stem from the absence of susy relations among couplings can also be easily found by comparing the results of this paper with those of previous studies on mixed sneutrino models .",
    "we examine the parameter space consistent with the cosmological dm abundance .",
    "the allowed regions are found when the mass of the wimp is half of that of the higgs boson or larger than around @xmath1 .",
    "if we further introduce a majorana mediator that corresponds to the bino in the mixed sneutrino models , the mass of the thermal wimp can be lighter than around @xmath2 . then , we discuss phenomenological implications for future collider experiments and dm detection experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "we introduce a complex scalar isospin doublet @xmath12 and singlet @xmath13 in addition to the sm particle contents .",
    "these new fields , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , as well as the left- and right - handed leptons , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are charged under a new global @xmath16 symmetry . here",

    "wimp annihilation proceeds not only by the higgs boson or the @xmath6-boson but also by the @xmath44-channel exchange of @xmath45 , and the resultant relic abundance depends on the mass and the coupling of the majorana mediator .",
    "we find that the effective annihilation cross section ( the relic abundance ) is maximized ( minimized ) for @xmath35 . for smaller mass differences ,",
