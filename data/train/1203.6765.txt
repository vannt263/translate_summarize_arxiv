    "recent consecutive solar observations by high - resolution imaging space telescopes and spectrometers have shown that the solar atmosphere is dynamic in nature and is composed of numerous magnetic structures of which coronal loops are of the centre of focus in this paper .",
    "it has been confirmed that these complex structures of the solar corona can support a wide range of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves which are natural carriers of energy and may have the key to solve the problem of solar coronal heating ( see , the recent review by _ e.g. _ ; ) . in particular ,",
    "one mhd wave mode present in coronal loops has become the centre of attention : the slow magneto - acoustic mode .",
    "the slow ( propagating and standing ) mhd waves are extensively supported by the solar coronal structures and are observed to be rapidly damped @xcite .    propagating intensity disturbances",
    "were first detected by the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer onboard the _ solar heliospheric observatory _ ( soho / uvcs ) along coronal plumes @xcite , and were identified as slow magneto - acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "subsequently , similar intensity disturbances were observed in coronal loops by the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace ) @xcite and the euv imaging telescope onboard the _ solar heliospheric observatory _ ( soho / eit ) @xcite . found that the slow mhd wave evolution is affected by dissipation and gravitational stratification . and have detected longitudinally propagating slow mhd waves with around five - minute period in the transition region and five coronal lines at the footpoint of a coronal loop by _ hinode_/eis .",
    "the source of these oscillations are suggested to be the leakage of the _ p _ modes from photosphere region through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona @xcite .",
    "oscillations interpreted as longitudinal standing ( slow ) magneto - acoustic waves have been observed in hot ( @xmath0  mk ) active region loops by the solar ultraviolet measurement of emitted radiation ( sumer ) spectrometer on board soho @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have periods in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 minutes with decay times of @xmath3 minutes and amplitudes between 12 and 353 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover , have reported doppler shift oscillations during solar flares with yohkoh in a high temperature region reaching @xmath5  mk .",
    "these oscillations are interpreted in terms of the standing - slow mode mhd waves @xcite .",
    "evidence for the standing slow mode can be underpinned from the phase relationship between velocity and intensity where a quarter - period phase difference is a characteristic of the standing waves while the propagating waves exhibit an in - phase relationship .",
    "therefore , an approximate quarter - period delay of the intensity variations behind the doppler shift strongly support that the oscillations observed by sumer are slow standing modes .",
    "the observed oscillations in coronal loops indicate that the standing slow modes are likely triggered by micro - flares which are produced by impulsive heating @xcite . in a recent work , found that longitudinal standing waves can be excited in cooler euv loops under the effect of all important mechanisms such as gravitational and thermal stratification , losses , etc . according to this study",
    ", hot loops are not only the origin of the standing waves but these waves can also be formed in cooler loops .",
    "nowadays , the damping of slow magneto - acoustic waves have become a subject of remarkable observational and theoretical attention due to a possibility of damping timescale of the waves on disclosing the physical processes that dominate the energy of the coronal loop in which they are detected .",
    "the majority of theoretical and numerical studies on damping of propagating and standing slow mhd waves show that the understanding of dominant mechanisms of rapid damping can be captured from 1d linear @xcite or nonlinear model @xcite .",
    "for instance , and found that the standing mhd waves are strongly damped because of thermal conduction in nonlinear model whereas using a linear mhd model indicated that the individual influence of thermal conduction or viscosity is not enough to account for the observed damping . in a static 1d isothermal",
    "medium , investigated the behaviour of both propagating and standing slow mhd waves in the presence of thermal conduction and compressive viscosity .",
    "they found that thermal conduction is the dominant damping mechanism of thermal and magneto  acoustic waves in coronal loops .",
    "it is also shown that thermal mode is damped in the form of standing waves .",
    "moreover , have shown that the radiative cooling causes a damping of the slow mode by up to 60@xmath6 within characteristic lifetimes .    studied the influence of gravitational stratification on damping of standing mhd waves in hot coronal loops and found that enhanced nonlinear viscous dissipation due to gravity may reduce the damping times by about @xmath7 compared to the unstratified loops .",
    "in contrast to most recent work , found that thermal conduction can only be accounted as damping mechanism when the compressive viscosity is added to the model . reported that the radiation due to a non - equilibrium ionisation balance could cause by up to @xmath8 reduction of wave - damping timescale in comparison to the equilibrium case .",
    "showed that shock dissipation at large amplitudes gives rise to enhancement of the damping rate which is up to @xmath9 larger than given by thermal conduction alone . in non - isothermal , hot , gravitationally stratified coronal loops , investigated the damping of standing slow ( longitudinal ) waves and found that the decay time of waves decreases with the increase of the initial temperature .",
    "further to this , they derived a relation between the damping time and the parameter determining the apex temperature in the form of second - order scaling polynomial . in all these earlier studies the background ( equilibrium ) plasma",
    "was considered time - independent .",
    "this is certainly a working model as long as the background plasma changes occur on timescales much longer than typical perturbation timescales . in a recent theoretical work by",
    ", the cooling of the background plasma due to thermal conduction has been found to _ decrease _ the rate of damping of the propagating magneto ",
    "acoustic waves in a weakly stratified atmosphere where temporal changes in the slowly evolving equilibrium were considered .    in this study",
    ", we examine how the cooling background state affects the longitudinal _ standing _ waves in a uniform magnetised plasma .",
    "the additional complexity of a time - dependent background gives us a step along to model hot coronal loops .",
    "the cooling of the background plasma is assumed to be dominated by thermal conduction in the presence of an unspecified thermodynamic source where the plasma is assumed to be cooling in time with an exponential profile .",
    "the coefficient of thermal conductivity is presumed to be varying as a function of time to investigate how the variation of thermal conduction influences the behaviour of standing slow - mode waves .",
    "the geometry of coronal loop is described by a semi - circular shape .",
    "an analytical solution for the time - dependant amplitude of the standing slow mhd waves is derived using the wkb theory with the aid of properties of sturm - liouville problems .",
    "the results exhibit that thermal conduction causes a significant variation on the amplitude of the standing magneto  acoustic modes with time .",
    "the amplitude of waves are found to suffer damping due to the cooling of the background plasma by thermal conduction .",
    "the influence of the ratio change of the period of standing oscillation to the cooling time scale on the rate of damping of hot - loop oscillations seems to be highly efficient , where increasing the value of this ratio deceases the strength of damping rapidly .",
    "consider a uniformly magnetised plasma in which the temperature is changing as a function of time due to thermal conduction and the density is a constant .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and aligned the @xmath10-axes , _ i.e. _ @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the background state can be described as follows :    l0.45     @xmath12     + here @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the background quantities identifying the temperature , pressure , density and magnetic field , respectively ; and @xmath17 is the period of the loop oscillation and @xmath18 is the cooling time scale . +   + the governing mhd equations for the background plasma take the following form @xmath19=(\\gamma-1)\\nabla(\\kappa_{\\|}\\nabla{t})+\\mathcal{l } , \\\\ & & { p}=\\frac{r}{\\tilde\\mu}\\rho{t},\\label{eq : gas - law}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{b}}}{\\partial{t}}=\\nabla\\times(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{b}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the flow velocity , @xmath21 is the magnetic field , @xmath22 is the gravity , @xmath23 is the magnetic permeability of free space , @xmath24 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath25 is the gas constant , @xmath26 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath27 is the temperature , @xmath28 is the thermal conduction term where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is an unspecified thermodynamic source term , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the plasma density and its pressure , respectively .    assuming that there is no background flow and the background density is constant , so the previous equations determining the background plasma state reduce to @xmath33 where the 0 index denotes background quantity .",
    "the observed cooling of coronal loops has been shown to be well - approximated by exponential profile for radiative - cooling loops (; , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , found that the temperature decreases exponentially in time due to thermal conduction in hot coronal loops . as a result",
    ", we will assume here that the cooling temperature profile of coronal loops has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the initial temperature at @xmath36 .",
