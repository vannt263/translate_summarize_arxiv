    "this equation is widely used to model brass instruments ( trombones , trumpets ) : the transport terms describe the steepening of waves , yielding the typical `` brassy '' effect @xcite , and the fractional term models the viscothermal losses at the wall of the duct @xcite . moreover , a linear fractional wave equation known as the lokshin model @xcite has been studied in e.g. @xcite , and can be seen as the superposition of two one - way fractional transport equations of this type .",
