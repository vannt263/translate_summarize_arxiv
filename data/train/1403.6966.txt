    "al@xmath1o@xmath2 also known as alumina is an important material due to its diverse industrial and technological applications and also due to its role in various geochemical processes.@xcite besides its most stable form , @xmath3-alumina , there are also several transition aluminas that can be obtained by the thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxides or oxyhydroxides.@xcite the @xmath0-alumina phase has been extensively studied mostly due to its applications as a catalyst or catalyst support.@xcite however , in spite of several experimental and theoretical works that have been devoted to the determination of its exact structure , the structure of @xmath0-alumina is still not fully understood.@xcite the inherent poor crystallinity of @xmath0-alumina , that can be prepared through various synthetic routes , significantly increases the difficulty of the problem . besides , the possible presence of hydrogen in @xmath0-alumina is still not understood.@xcite the clarification of the structural and physical - chemical properties of @xmath0-alumina helps to understand the catalytic properties of this material .",
    "the catalytic properties of @xmath0-alumina are related with its lewis acidic surface due to the presence of hydroxyl groups.@xcite this is because water molecules can undergo dissociative adsorption at the surface of @xmath0-alumina.@xcite however , this feature alone can not be responsible for the differences in catalytic properties of @xmath0-alumina and @xmath3-alumina ; because hydroxylated @xmath3-alumina also has lewis acidic surface sites due to dissociative water adsorption.@xcite the hydrogenation of @xmath0-alumina was suggested to be the possible reason for the catalytic differences between this and the other aluminas.@xcite the cation vacancies of @xmath0-alumina are possible traps for protons , and it was found that the penetration of protons from the surface into the al vacancies of the subsurface is very likely to occur and the energy barrier for this process is 1.05 ev / proton.@xcite    there are mainly two points of view in what concerns the structure of @xmath0-alumina .",
    "these points of view differ mostly with regard to the content of hydrogen in the structure .",
    "one point of view states that @xmath0-alumina is a stoichiometric transition alumina with a defective spinel structure .",
    "this model has its origins in x - ray diffraction studies and dates back to 1935.@xcite the proposed structure is closely related to the mgal@xmath1o@xmath4 magnesium aluminate spinel structure which contains tetrahedral cation sites ( mg sites ) and octahedral cation sites ( al sites ) .",
    "the cubic unit cell of this magnesium aluminum spinel comprises 8 mg cations ( at 8a sites ) , 16 al cations ( at 16d sites ) and 32 close - packed o anions ( at 32e sites ) . the cation sites are not fully occupied in order to meet the stoichiometry of @xmath0-alumina , and 2@xmath5 cation sites per cell have to be vacant .",
    "conventionally , the formula is designated as @xmath6al@xmath7o@xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the vacancy .",
    "it is still a matter of debate which cation sites are preferred by the vacancies .",
    "it has been reported that the vacancies are formed preferably at the octahedral sites , but other observations indicate the preference for tetrahedral sites.@xcite the fraction of tetrahedrally coordinated al should be limited between 25% and 37.5% . early experiments by verwey and jagodszinski suggested the presence of vacancies at octahedral positions , with tetrahedrally coordinated al amounting to 37.5%.@xcite however , a later experimental work by saalfeld reported a different result with tetrahedrally coordinated al amounting to 25%.@xcite the fraction of tetrahedrally coordinated al in @xmath0-alumina determined by solid - state nmr is around 21@xmath1031%.@xcite a computational study based on density functional theory ( dft ) by mo _",
    "et al . _ , suggested that the octahedral sites are more favorable for the formation of vacancies by 3.7 ev / vacancy.@xcite additionally , other studies point towards the preference for vacancy formation at octahedral sites . in a recent work , sun _",
    "performed dft calculations and rietveld simulations to confirm the energetic preference for vacancies at octahedral sites.@xcite nevertheless , it has also been shown that the defective spinel structure with cation vacancies distributed between the two types of sites is in better agreement with experimental x - ray powder diffraction pattern.@xcite overall there are discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results in what concerns the location of vacancies .",
    "the results of knzinger and ratnasamy have shown a considerably disordered occupancy of tetrahedrally coordinated al .",
    "this would make @xmath0-alumina similar to @xmath11-alumina.@xcite zhou and snyder have also shown evidence for disordered occupancy of tetrahedrally coordinated al.@xcite the classical molecular dynamics simulation based on pairwise additive empirical potential functions performed by alvarez confirmed the occupancy of non - spinel sites.@xcite overall , the computational data point towards the preference for vacancies at octahedral sites .",
    "the disorder has its origins in temperature effects and synthetic factors .",
    "another type of suggested structures are the hydrogenated models of @xmath0-alumina .",
    "the first model was introduced by dowden in 1950.@xcite it was proposed that , in the presence of water , hydrogen can occupy the cation vacancies in @xmath0-alumina .",
    "later , de boer and houben conducted an x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) study and suggested a hydrogenated spinel structure denoted as al@xmath1o@xmath12h@xmath1o to account for the mass balance by variable water content @xmath13.@xcite such notation often leads people to take @xmath0-alumina as a hydrated crystal . in the cited work , it was also suggested that the stoichiometry al@xmath1o@xmath14(1/5)h@xmath1o with @xmath15 corresponds to a perfect hydrogenated spinel hal@xmath16o@xmath17 .",
    "this conclusion was based on the analysis of several types of @xmath0-alumina crystals with different hydrogen content.@xcite the presence of hydrogen in bulk @xmath0-alumina was independently observed by maciver and lnoard.@xcite in a nmr investigation by pearson , the measured fraction of hydrogen in the bulk ( rather than on the surface ) was @xmath18 which very close to the value @xmath19 of the perfect hydrogenated spinel structure.@xcite another hydrogenated spinel model proposed by soled consisted in replacing o@xmath20 by two surface oh@xmath21 groups.@xcite however , the growth of @xmath0-alumina by ion implantation and the annealing of @xmath3-alumina ruled out this assumption.@xcite other studies using diverse techniques have pointed towards the existence of hydrogenated structures . using the xrd technique ,",
    "ushakov and moroz found that only the structure containing residual bulk hydrogen could account for the experimentally recorded xrd patterns.@xcite tsyganenko _",
    "_ observed oh@xmath21 peaks in the infrared spectrum which were assigned to bulk oh@xmath21 rather than surface oh@xmath21 groups.@xcite in recent studies , dft calculations were used to investigate the role of hydrogen in bulk @xmath0-alumina .",
    "_ found that the hydrogenated spinel structures described as h@xmath22al@xmath23o@xmath2 are considerably lower in energy than the defective spinel structures ( with the perfect hydrogenated spinel structure hal@xmath16o@xmath17 to be the lowest in energy ) .",
    "furthermore , the calculated vibrational frequencies of bulk oh bonds agree well with experiments.@xcite however , the calculated volume of @xmath3-alumina has a large deviation from experimental data , which raises questions about the accuracy of the calculations . in a study by wolverton and hass",
    ", it has been shown that the hydrogenated spinel structure ( hal@xmath16o@xmath17 ) is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the decomposition into boehmite and defective spinel structure of @xmath0-alumina.@xcite yet , the studies of sun _ et al .",
    "_ suggest that the hydrogenated spinel structure is more stable than the defective spinel structure at @xmath24  k , and the opposite for @xmath25  k.@xcite    to enable for a careful analysis of relative stabilities for the competing structures it is necessary to make the expression for the gibbs free energy as complete as possible .",
    "worth of notice is the fact that , none of the previous _ ab initio _ studies of @xmath0-alumina has taken into consideration the vibrational contribution to the gibbs free energy .",
    "the vibrational and thermal properties of alumina are of great interest to many industrial processes .",
    "data on the thermal properties of @xmath0-alumina are scarce due to its structural complexity .    furthermore , configurational entropy was never considered and evaluated in previous _ ab initio _ studies of this system .",
    "a part of configurational entropy associated with frozen - in disorder , referred to as residual entropy , originates from the degeneracy or near degeneracy in energy of a manifold of atomic configurations in the structures of some aluminum oxides and hydroxides .",
    "the disordered distribution of vacancies and hydrogen may be present in these compounds even at low temperatures and give rise to significant residual entropy contributions which may be important for the determination of relative phase stabilities .",
    "in this work , we perform dft calculations of the electron and phonon spectra for the two structural models of @xmath0-alumina as well as for boehmite alooh .",
    "the residual entropy of these phases is evaluated using the approach proposed by pauling.@xcite using the calculated data , the vibrational and thermal properties of the compounds are calculated , including the heat capacity , entropy , and gibbs free energy .",
    "we also present the calculated phonon dispersions and raman - active modes for the defective spinel @xmath0-alumina , hydrogenated spinel @xmath0-alumina , and boehmite .",
    "the present calculations are based on density functional theory ( dft ) and use a plane - wave basis set , as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the interaction between the ions and valence electrons is described by the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite most of the calculations , including structural relaxations and phonon spectra calculations , are done on the level of generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , employing the exchange - correlation functional by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite in general , semilocal gga functionals are known to underestimate the electronic bandgap of semiconductors and insulators , while providing good structural accuracy.@xcite    to derive accurate gibbs free energy of the system , one needs a functional that provides satisfactory structural accuracy .",
    "it has been shown that the gga based functionals implemented in vasp can provide accurate structure and energy data for aluminum oxides and oxyhydroxides.@xcite therefore , the relative thermal stabilities of the materials studied in this work are assessed on the basis of pbe calculations .",
    "however , we also employ the hybrid functional approach to compare with the pbe results and assure the quality of calculations . for that purpose",
    "we use pbe0 functional @xcite which contains 25% of the exact nonlocal hatree - fock ( hf ) exchange , and 75% of the pbe exchange , and 100% of the pbe correlation energy .    in our work , a plane - wave cut - off energy of",
    "550 ev was enough to reach convergence and was used in the calculations of defective spinel @xmath0-alumina . for the pbe type of calculations , a k - mesh of 3@xmath269@xmath269",
    "was tested to reach energy convergence , and 1@xmath263@xmath263 was used for the pbe0 type of calculations .",
    "the total energy difference was converged to less than 1@xmath2610@xmath27 ev / unit cell , and the force acting on each atom is converged within @xmath28 ev /  .",
    "hydrogenated spinel @xmath0-alumina was also considered in our study , for comparison with the defective spinel model .",
    "a k - mesh of 9@xmath269@xmath269 and a plane - wave cut - off energy of 550 ev were used for the pbe type of calculations of this structure , and a 3@xmath263@xmath263 mesh was used for the pbe0 type of calculations . the total energy and force",
    "were converged with the same accuracy as for the defective spinel structure .",
    "although the location of the vacancies is not yet fully understood from experimental data , previous theoretical studies have pointed towards the preference for formation of vacancies at octahedral sites.@xcite in ref .",
    "et al . _ , using a model proposed by gutirrez , taga and johansson,@xcite have done a detailed study on vacancy distribution energies .",
    "structures with all possible vacancy distributions within the chosen supercell were considered and compared .",
    "it was found that the supercell structure with two vacancies located at two octahedral sites about 8.2  away from each other , is the lowest in energy , and is in good agreement with experimental x - ray power diffraction data .",
    "therefore we have chosen this structure as the defective spinel model for this study . a different study by maglia and gennari @xcite produced results that are consistent with the calculations in ref . .",
    "the hydrogenated spinel structure of @xmath0-alumina proposed by de boer and houben@xcite was confirmed by sohlberg,@xcite which corresponds to a stable and perfect hydrogenated spinel structure .",
    "the primitive cell contains eight o atoms , five al atoms and one h atom .",
    "the phonon dispersions were calculated by means of phonopy code,@xcite which is an implementation of post - process phonon analyzer , from the hessian matrix calculated using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) and pbe functional implemented in vasp .",
    "we used a 4@xmath261@xmath263 , and a 2@xmath262@xmath262 supercell to calculate the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix for the defective spinel structure and hydrogenated spinel structure , respectively .",
    "the phonon - related thermal properties of these compounds were then derived from the calculated phonon spectra .",
    "the configurational ( residual ) entropy stems from the intrinsic disorder of the geometrically frustrated crystal lattice .",
    "a classical example is the case of h@xmath1o ice that was first treated by pauling.@xcite the hydrogen in ice has some degree of freedom sitting between the oxygen atoms , leading to an enormous number of configurations that are nearly indiscernible in energy .",
    "the presence of structural vacancies in a crystal also can increase the disorder and bring in considerable configurational entropy .",
    "the residual configurational entropies were evaluated using pauling s approach.@xcite the procedure is described below for the two models of @xmath0-alumina and for boehmite .",
    "+ ( a ) defective spinel structure of @xmath0-alumina : pauling s assumption that in the minimal primitive cell al@xmath17o@xmath29 of @xmath0-alumina structure the nine cation sites are occupied by eight al@xmath30 ions completely at random gives the following estimate for the configurational entropy ( per mole of al@xmath1o@xmath2 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant . since the present calculations show that cation vacancies prefer octahedral sites ( six out of the nine sites per al@xmath17o@xmath29 formula ) , the configurational entropy of @xmath0-alumina at low temperatures reduces to : @xmath33 + ( b ) hydrogenated spinel structure of @xmath0-alumina : a charge - balanced formula of the hydrogenated spinel , hal@xmath16o@xmath17 , corresponds to one protonated vacancy per six cation sites ( two tetrahedral and four octahedral ) .",
    "the proton inside a cation vacancy binds to one of the neighboring o anions to form an oh group . assuming a completely random substitution of any cation site by hydrogen ( and also that the oh formation is completely uncorrelated ) , one arrives at the following upper - bound estimate @xmath34 for the configurational entropy ( per formula unit al@xmath1o@xmath35h@xmath1o ) : @xmath36 \\\\",
    "& \\cong & 1.744 k_{\\rm b } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the largest part , @xmath37 , is due to the randomness of vacancy distribution , while the remaining part , @xmath38 , is due to the proton disorder .",
    "+ ( c ) boehmite : the low - temperature phase of alooh has a layered structure in which hydroxylated double oxide layers are hold together by hydrogen bonds .",
    "the hydrogen bonds are arranged into zig - zag chains with two possible orientations of the hydroxyl groups , left @xmath39h@xmath40o@xmath39h@xmath40o@xmath39 and right @xmath39o@xmath40h@xmath39o@xmath40h@xmath39 .",
    "the sequence can be reversed by means of a defect denoted here as a `` break point '' ( bp ) .",
    "let us denote the concentration of such point defects in boehmite as @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the average length of ordered ( left or right ) chains between two point defects , @xmath43 is the number of alooh units in the crystal , and @xmath44 is the number of bp defects .",
    "the defect formation energy @xmath45 is assumed to be positive .",
    "free energy minimization with respect to the defect concentration yields : @xmath46^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the equilibrium concentration of bp defects is exponentially small at low temperatures , which means that the residual entropy of boehmite is zero .",
    "two structural models of @xmath0-alumina : ( a ) the defective spinel model ; ( b ) the hydrogenated spinel model with three primitive cells . for clarity ,",
    "the al atoms are shown larger than the o atoms.[structure],width=8 ]    figure [ structure ] shows the two structural models of @xmath0-alumina . in the defective spinel model ( figure [ structure](a ) ) , there are 24 oxygen atoms that constitute the 6 tetrahedron cages and 12 octahedron cages , in which 16 aluminum atoms are located . besides , there are two vacancies located inside two octahedron cages .",
    "the primitive cell of a hydrogenated structure contains 14 atoms : 8 oxygen atoms , 5 aluminum atoms and 1 hydrogen atom .",
    "there are two choices for positioning the hydrogen atoms when constructing the structure of the hydrogenated model from the mg@xmath1al@xmath4o@xmath17 primitive cell .",
    "the model can be built up either by replacing half of the mg with al and the other half with h , or by substituting one of the al atoms with an h atom and also replacing all of the mg by al . in the first case ,",
    "the hydrogen is tetrahedrally ( tetra ) coordinated , while in the second case , the hydrogen is octahedrally ( oct ) coordinated .",
    "however , during relaxation the hydrogen will deflect from the center of the oxygen cage to form a hydroxyl group with one of the neighboring oxygen atoms .",
    "we have found that the two structures ( tetra and oct ) are nearly isoenergetic ( the calculated difference is less than 0.06 ev ) .",
    "building a supercell by tripling the primitive cell of the hydrogenated model can slightly lower the total energy of the system due to the independent relaxation of the three hydrogens .",

    "worth of notice is the fact that the defective spinel phase of @xmath0-alumina has higher entropy than @xmath3-alumina , but lower specific heat at temperatures above 500 k. this is because of the intrinsic vacancies in @xmath0-alumina .",
