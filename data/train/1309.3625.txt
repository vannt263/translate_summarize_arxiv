    "therefore , this crossing pair can be extended to crossing pairs of @xmath3-simplices in @xmath55 ways .",
    "[ fig1 ]      in section @xmath27 , we first show that there are at least @xmath56 crossing pairs of @xmath27-simplices in a given set of @xmath57 points in general position in @xmath58 .",
