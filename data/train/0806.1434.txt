    "the formation and evolution of massive ( stellar mass @xmath4 ) galaxies represent one of the key issues in understanding the whole picture of mass assembly in the universe .",
    "this class of objects is believed to correspond to the local early - type galaxies , i.e. , ellipticals and spheroidals , constituting the brightest end of the luminosity function .",
    "they are predicted to form gradually with time through merging of smaller subsets in the hierarchical structure formation scenario based on the @xmath5 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the @xmath5cdm model can successfully reproduce the large scale structure of galaxies , difficulties appear when it deals with smaller systems such as individual galaxies .",
    "although the hierarchical scenario predicts the time of appearance of the most massive galaxies at @xmath6 , there is growing evidence that fully assembled galaxies exist at @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the alternative scenario of mass assembly is represented by the monolithic model , in which galaxies are formed in a single collapse and star burst , and subsequently evolve passively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this framework even the most massive galaxies could exist in very early universe .",
    "while both the hierarchical and monolithic scenarios are consistent with the observations in the local universe , their differences should become evident at @xmath8 .",
    "recently @xcite showed that the observed mass growth of massive galaxies from @xmath9 to @xmath10 is significantly different from the prediction of the millennium simulation @xcite based on the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "thus motivated by their unique importance , the massive galaxies beyond redshift @xmath11 have been a subject of extensive studies over the last decade .",
    "several large survey programs have been completed or are ongoing , such as the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the k20 survey @xcite , and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath8 massive galaxies exhibit very red optical to near - ir colors , either due to evolved stellar populations , or severe reddening in case of dusty starbursts , and they form a class of extremely red objects ( eros ; * ? ?",
    "this ero nature is commonly utilized to pick up the objects from multi - color photometry catalogs for subsequent spectroscopy , usually carried out in the red - visible ( 0.6  0.9 @xmath2 m ) light , to obtain the objects redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the recent studies have been achieving great successes in revealing the mass assembly history out to the redshift @xmath12 2 , and placing significant constraints on the galaxy formation scenarios , one should be aware of the fact that most of these works are based on optical spectroscopic observations supplemented with near - ir broad - band photometry , usually fitted with the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models constructed from the local galaxy populations .",
    "it is based on the implicit assumption that the optical to ir sed , and its evolution with age , of the @xmath8 galaxies are well represented by those of local counterparts . however , such an assumption has not yet been observationally confirmed due to the lack of the data with sufficiently large ( i.e. , from optical to near- or mid - ir ) spectral coverage .",
    "the same shortage of the data has prevented the empirical - template method to be used in the analysis of the observed ( spectral or broad - band ) seds in wide wavelength ranges .",
    "although recent works based on the large surveys have constructed some composite spectra by stacking all the obtained data , such composites have an apparent disadvantage in that different parts of the spectra are represented by systematically different galaxy populations , e.g. , blue part by the high - redshift objects and red part by the low - redshift objects .",
    "thus , the accumulation of the observations and analysis of wide spectral regions for individual galaxies are definitely needed at this stage in order to make comprehensive studies of the massive galaxy population existing at @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we report the first example of that kind of data , a red - visible to near - ir ( 0.6  2.3 @xmath2 m ) spectrum of the massive evolved galaxy tsps j1329@xmath00957 at @xmath1 = 1.26 .",
    "it has been discovered in the course of the tokyo - stromlo photometry survey ( tsps ) which we are conducting in the high galactic - latitude sky observed from the southern hemisphere .",

    "the r400_g5325 grating was used with the rg610_g0331 filter , at two slightly different central wavelengths ( 791.0 nm and 794.0 nm ) in order to fill the ccd gaps .",
    "a slit width of 1.0  was used in average seeing of 0.8 .",
    "this configuration gives a wavelength coverage of 0.6  1.0 @xmath2 m and a resolution of @xmath36 .",
    "the object was dithered along the slit in the classical a - b - b - a pattern for better sky subtraction .",

    "since the galaxy possibly exhibits an extended feature whose morphology is dependent on the observed wavelength , though the morphology in the @xmath22-band images is not very clear due to the poor seeing ( @xmath372 ) of the wfi observations ( see fig .",

    "the near - ir spectrum of tsps j1329@xmath00957 was obtained during 4 nights in 2007 february and march ( program i d : gs-2007a - q-14 ) .",

    "two off - source ( sky ) positions were observed by slightly offsetting the telescope perpendicular to the slit in order to obtain sky spectra which were used for subtracting sky emission from the object frames .",
    "total exposure time on source is 2.0 hours constituting of 16 450-sec exposures .",
    "data reduction was carried out with the gemini.gnirs package within the iraf in a standard manner .",

    "the a0v- and f0v - type stars , hip 63109 and hip 63151 , were observed as telluric standard stars to which blackbody spectra with appropriate temperatures were fitted in order to calculate the sensitivity along the dispersion axis .",
    "the additional aperture correction described in the previous section were not applied since the galaxy shows fairly concentrated shapes with spatial profiles similar to those of nearby stars in the @xmath21 bands . the spectral slope beyond @xmath371.2 @xmath2 m agrees with the broad - band @xmath42 and @xmath43 colors within the measurement errors .",
    "we do not use the gnirs spectrum at wavelengths shorter than @xmath371.2 @xmath2 m since the appropriate broad - band ( e.g. , @xmath44-band ) imaging data is not available for checking the slit loss . as in the optical spectrum , the calibration of the absolute flux scale was obtained from the broad - band photometric data .",

    "the detection of hk lines and absence of any strong emission features such as [ ] @xmath453727 , as well as the overall sed , clearly indicate that tsps j1329@xmath00957 is an old , passively - evolving galaxy whose light is dominated by evolved stellar population . considering its redshift and @xmath31-band brightness ( @xmath31 = 17.6 mag ) , this ero is likely to be among the most massive galaxies with a stellar mass m@xmath46 exceeding 10@xmath47 m@xmath48 .",

    "it clearly demonstrates the early - type nature of tsps j1329@xmath00957 , containing little amount of dust responsible for the reddening of the visible light . on the other hand ,",
    "a small but clear difference is seen in the 4000   break .",
    "we show the d4000 index , adopting the definition of @xcite , of various composite spectra and tsps j1329@xmath00957 in figure [ d4000 ] .",
    "the plotted composites are those described above plus those generated from the gdds early - type galaxies at @xmath1 = 1.3  1.4 , the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs ) pure early - type galaxies @xcite , and the munich near - ir cluster survey ( munics ) `` young '' early - type galaxy population defined by @xcite . also shown , are the predictions of the sps models by the @xcite code , assuming an exponentially - declining star formation history with the e - folding time @xmath50 = 1.0 gyr , the metallicity @xmath20 = @xmath51 , 0.4 @xmath51 and 0.2 @xmath51 , and the epoch of the onset of star formation at redshift @xmath52 = 7 .",
    "the figure clearly shows the increase of the observed d4000 index from @xmath1 = 1.5 toward the local universe , which coincides with the simple galaxy aging represented by the sps models .",
    "the index of tsps j1329@xmath00957 is also on this trend and is consistent with those of the gdds galaxies and the munics young subsamples within the measurement error .",
    "we infer the age of tsps j1329@xmath00957 to be a few gyr .        here",
    "we compare the overall sed of tsps j1329@xmath00957 with the predictions of sps models by the @xcite code . in the model calculations ,",
    "star formation is assumed to start at @xmath53 gyr before the galaxy is observed and subsequently reduce its rate exponentially with the e - folding time @xmath50 gyr .",
    "dust content is parametrized in terms of the color excess @xmath54 with the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "these parameters are varied over the plausible ranges , i.e. , @xmath53 = 0.01  10.0 gyr , @xmath50 = 0.01  10.0 gyr , and @xmath54 = 0.0  1.0 mag , and the best - fitting model is searched for by the least @xmath55 method .",
    "the total stellar mass of the galaxy is determined through normalization of the model sed .",
    "we start with the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and the solar metallicity ( @xmath20 = @xmath51 ) .",
    "although other sets of calculations adopting the @xcite dust extinction raw or the @xcite imf were also performed , they provide neither better fits nor significantly different best - fitting results .",
    "we show the best - fitting model with the observed spectrum in figure [ full_spec ] ( _ green _ ) .",
    "the ( observed - frame ) optical and near - ir parts of the spectrum make similar contributions to the @xmath55 where it is minimum .",
    "as seen in the figure , the overall agreement between the observation and the model is fairly good over the whole wavelength range .",
    "the parameter values comprising the best - fitting model are summarized in the first row of table [ sps_params ] .",
    "they are : @xmath53 = 2.4@xmath56 gyr , @xmath50 = 0.55@xmath57 gyr , @xmath54 = 0.06@xmath58 mag , and log @xmath59 [ @xmath60 = @xmath61 where the quoted errors denote 90 % confidence . the derived age ( 2  3 gyr ) and dust content (",
    "@xmath62 0.1 mag ) are quite consistent with the estimates from d4000 index and from the comparison with the composite spectra of the early - type galaxies as described in the previous section .",
    "we have also performed the calculations assuming the sub-/super - solar metallicity ( @xmath20 = 0.4 @xmath51 and 2.5 @xmath51 ) and found that the best - fit age of the galaxy is @xmath371.5-gyr older / younger than the original ( @xmath20 = @xmath51 ) case , which is the consequence of the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however , no better fits than the @xmath20 = @xmath51 case are achieved in these calculations .",
    "thus we conclude that tsps j1329@xmath00957 is very likely to be formed 2  3 gyr before it was observed , and subsequently evolved passively to become one of the most massive objects found in the @xmath1 = 1 - 2 universe .",
    "its formation epoch corresponds to the redshift @xmath52 = 2.6 when the universe is about 2.5 gyr old .",
    "it is similar to the median formation redshift of the gdds evolved galaxies studied by @xcite ( @xmath63 = 2.4 ) and of the munics young subsamples studied by @xcite ( @xmath63 = 2.3 ) .",
    "the early - type nature and the estimated stellar mass of @xmath3 clearly indicate that the galaxy is a direct ancestor of the brightest elliptical and spheroidal galaxies present in the local universe .",
    "most of the previous studies have utilized optical spectra supplemented with near - ir broad - band photometry in deriving the physical properties of eros by the sed - model fitting .",
    "thus it is useful to compare the fitting results for such data sets with the above results for the whole ( optical and near - ir ) spectral data .",
    "we first consider the optical spectrum with the @xmath64 ( @xmath31)-band photometry , which is the most common data set used in the ero studies .",
    "the @xmath31-band magnitude was calculated from the gnirs spectrum and the sirius filter transmission curve .",
    "we fitted the sps - model seds to this data set in the same way as described above , and deduced the best - fitting parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in the second row of table [ sps_params ] ; the data set yields smaller @xmath53 , @xmath50 and @xmath54 than the case of the whole spectral data .",
    "the shorter duration of star formation makes the galaxy sed ( at a fixed age ) redder while the younger age and less dust content make it bluer , thus the overall sed is similar to the case of the whole spectral data .",
    "detailed features in the near - ir spectrum give rise to the difference in the best - fitting parameters for the two data sets . adding the @xmath29- and @xmath30-band photometry to the above data set",
    "does not improve the situation ( the last row of table [ sps_params ] ) ; the derived @xmath53 , @xmath50 and @xmath54 are tend to be even smaller than the previous case .",
    "these three parameters are clearly degenerated and the different data sets find the best sed models on the different locations of this ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 , @xmath54 ) degeneracy sequence . on the other hand ,",
    "the total stellar mass @xmath59 is found to be fairly robust .",
    "it is consistent with the results of the previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reporting the robustness of the stellar - mass estimate as opposed to other parameters ( galaxy age , star - formation duration , metallicity , etc . ) suffering from various degeneracies .",
    "we conclude that the optical spectrum supplemented with the near - ir broad - band data provide slightly different view of the target galaxy from those deduced from the whole spectral data .",
    "however , the basic classification of the galaxy could be achieved without the near - ir spectrum ; the three data sets listed in table [ sps_params ] consistently suggest that the galaxy is a few gyr old system with faded star - formation activity and with little dust .",
    "the stellar - mass estimate is fairly robust .",
    "we note that the errors of the @xmath21 broad - band magnitudes used above have been calculated by appropriately propagating the error of the gnirs spectrum , which gives 0.05 mag for the @xmath29 band and 0.03 mag for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands .",
    "these are similar to the typical magnitude errors achieved in recent photometric observations .",
    "thus the above data sets of the optical spectrum with the near - ir broad - band photometry well represent those obtained in real observing programs .",
    "we present a gemini / gmos and gnirs spectrum of the galaxy tsps j1329@xmath00957 , a red and bright member of the ero population .",
    "it has been discovered in the course of the tokyo - stromlo photometry survey ( tsps ) we are developing in the southern sky .",
    "the spectrum covers red - visible to near - ir ( 0.6  2.3 @xmath2 m ) wavelength range , providing a useful example to be compared with the same population which has been vigorously discovered in the recent surveys using the 8-m class telescopes and multi - object spectrographs .",
    "the hk absorption lines are clearly detected , which gives the redshift of the galaxy as @xmath1 = 1.26 .",
    "the detection of hk lines , the absence of any strong emission features , and the overall sed indicate that the galaxy is an old , passively - evolving system whose light is dominated by an evolved stellar population .",
    "we compared the observed spectrum with the predictions of the sps models and found that the model with age 2 3 gyr , little amount of dust ( @xmath62 0.1 mag ) , and stellar mass @xmath59 = @xmath65 to best - fit the observations .",
    "the inferred properties of the galaxy are supported by the estimate from the d4000 index and by the resemblance of the observed spectrum to several composite spectra of early - type galaxies at @xmath66 1 .",
    "we also investigated the effectiveness of using near - ir broad - band data , instead of the spectral data , in deriving the galaxy properties .",

    "<S> we present the optical to near - infrared ( ir ) spectrum of the galaxy tsps j1329@xmath00957 , a red and bright member of the class of extremely red objects ( eros ) at @xmath1 = 1.26 . </S>",
    "<S> this galaxy was found in the course of the tokyo - stromlo photometry survey ( tsps ) which we are conducting in the southern sky . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic observations were carried out with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) and the gemini near infra - red spectrograph ( gnirs ) mounted on the gemini - south telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the wide wavelength coverage of 0.6  2.3 @xmath2 m provides useful clues as to the nature of eros while most published spectra are limited to a narrower spectral range which is dictated by the need for efficient redshift determination in a large survey . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our spectrum with several optical composite spectra obtained in recent large surveys , and with stellar population synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of using near - ir broad - band data , instead of the spectral data , in deriving the galaxy properties are also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that tsps j1329@xmath00957 formed when the universe was 2  3 gyr old , and subsequently evolved passively to become one of the most massive galaxies found in the @xmath1 = 1  2 universe . </S>",
    "<S> its early type and estimated stellar mass of @xmath3 clearly point to this galaxy being a direct ancestor of the brightest elliptical and spheroidal galaxies in the local universe . </S>"
