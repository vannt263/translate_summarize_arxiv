    "the last term of ( [ eq : hb ] ) incorporates the su - schrieffer - heeger  @xcite interaction between the electrons and the dynamic phonons @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 the electron - phonon interaction , @xmath24 the mass of the nuclei , and @xmath25 the displacement matrix of eigenmode @xmath19 , which is given by @xmath26 the metallic leads are described by semi - infinite tight - binding chains with hopping @xmath27 , on - site energy @xmath28 , and chemical potential @xmath29 ( @xmath30eft or @xmath31ight ) .",
    "we assume that the bias voltage @xmath32 is applied symmetrically , i.e. , @xmath33 and that the leads are equilibrated , i.e. , that the occupation follows the fermi - dirac statistics @xmath34^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath36 the temperature .        in this paper",
    ", we use the negf framework to evaluate the nonequilibrium steady - state properties along the lines presented in ref .  .",
    "due to the electron - phonon interaction it is in general not possible to solve the problem exactly and thus we employ cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) :  @xcite in short , the system is first divided into several clusters , each of which can be solved exactly either analytically or numerically , taking correlations on the cluster level into account exactly .",
    "strong coupling cpt is then employed to connect the individual clusters .    here ,",
    "we divide the molecular device into three clusters : ( i ) the central region consisting of the benzene ring with vibrational degrees of freedom and ( ii ) the left and ( iii ) right metallic leads which are connected to the molecular device . from the exact solution of the isolated interacting central region we obtain an approximate self - energy of the full system .",
    "the results can also be systematically improved by incorporating lead sites into the central system .",
    "@xcite based on considerations similar to those of meir and wingreen  @xcite we can show that within this cpt approach the current is of the landauer - bttiker form  @xcite even though correlations are included exactly on the cluster level . in particular , we find @xmath37\\ ; , \\label{eq : j}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the transmission coefficient matrix @xmath39 this matrix contains the retarded ( advanced ) gf @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) which within cpt is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the exact retarded gf of the isolated benzene molecule , @xmath44 takes into account the effect of lead @xmath0 on the gf , @xmath45 is the tunneling coupling between the central device and lead @xmath0 , and @xmath46 stands for the retarded lead gf .",
    "@xcite in addition , the transmission @xmath38 depends on the imaginary part of the lead induced self - energy via @xmath47 . similarly , the expression for the shot noise , i.e. , current - current correlations , in the zero frequency limit reads  @xcite @xmath48 \\operatorname{\\mbox{tr}}[\\mathcal{t } ] \\nonumber \\\\     & + ( f_l - f_r)^2 \\operatorname{\\mbox{tr}}[(1-\\mathcal{t})\\mathcal{t}]\\label{eq : s}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in principle the nonequilibrium properties can be determined by solving the eigenvalue problem of @xmath49 numerically taking all vibrational modes into account using the formulas discussed above . within this approach",
    "it is also straight forward to introduce electron - electron interactions giving rise to kondo physics provided the molecule is ( asymmetrically ) electron or hole doped .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , however , we want to study the main effects generated by the electron - phonon interaction . in order to gain insight into the problem we focus on a single vibrational mode , in particular on the breathing mode illustrated in fig.[fig : benz ] . coupling the benzene ring to the leads breaks the c6 rotational invariance of the molecule .",
    "however , calculations reveal that a breathing - like mode should still exists in that case",
    ". a very appealing feature of this somewhat simplified mode is the fact that the resulting interacting model of the central region can be solved analytically and thus provides a transparent insight into phonon mediated correlation effects on the non - equilibrium physics of such a molecular electronic device .",
    "for a single vibrational mode @xmath50 ( not necessarily the breathing mode ) we can readily eliminate the electron - phonon interaction by a unitary transformation of the lang - firsov type .",
    "@xcite to this end we first diagonalize the displacement matrix @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues and @xmath53 the corresponding matrix of eigenvectors , and transform the electron operators accordingly @xmath54 , where we introduce the vector notation @xmath55 .",
    "the lang - firsov like unitary transformation is generated by the operator @xmath56 all operators that are subject to the unitary transformation are denoted by @xmath57 , which in particular results in @xmath58 the lang - firsov transformation eliminates the explicit electron - phonon interaction and results in an effective hamiltonian @xmath59 .",
    "the electronic gf entering the transport properties of the molecular junction [ eq.([eq : jt ] ) ] is transformed accordingly , i.e. , @xmath60 by replacing @xmath61 in its definition .",
    "for the particular case of the breathing mode the matrices @xmath62 and the matrix describing the nearest neighbor hopping commute and thus can be diagonalized by a common set of eigenvectors . in this case",
    "we find @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the @xmath65 thus create electrons with a given ( angular ) momentum @xmath66 in the molecule . in the transformed hamiltonian",
    "the electronic part becomes @xmath67 after this transformation , the electron and vibrational degrees of freedom are completely decoupled but instead an attractive electron - electron interaction proportional to @xmath68 emerges . at first sight hamiltonian ( [ eq : he ] ) might be reminiscent of the holstein hamiltonian ; note however , that the parentheses enclose the sum in the second term , which gives rise to additional contributions mixing different angular momenta @xmath66 .",
    "the interacting hamiltonian ( [ eq : he ] ) can be solved exactly .",
    "the eigenvectors are of the form @xmath69 , i.e. , they are tensor products of the oscillator eigenvectors @xmath70 and the slater determinants @xmath71 are composed of the molecular orbital operators @xmath72 dressed by bond - distortions that are encoded in the lang - firsov factor of eq.([eq : d ] ) . in eq.([eq : he ] ) the dressed particles ( polarons ) are conserved , however , the current is calculated for the electrons , which exhibit inelastic electron - phonon scattering . for the electron gf of a single spin - species we find @xmath73    \\end{split }      \\label{eq : gex}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 and the energies are",
    "@xmath75 @xmath76 is the equilibrium number of electrons in the benzene molecule and fs denotes the fermi sea .",
    "the physical properties of the system are particularly transparent in the differential conductance which up to order @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 \\;.\\label{eq : diff : cond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] along with eqs.([eq : jt ] ) and ( [ eq : gex ] ) it can be deduced that current pathways open up , whenever @xmath80 is equal to an the excitation energy in the particle sector or in the hole sector .",
    "next , the impact of phonons on the transport properties will be investigated guided by the breathing mode of a benzene molecule .",
    "we use the parameters reported in ref .   for the benzene molecule and the electron - phonon coupling ; in particular we set @xmath81ev , @xmath82ev , @xmath83ev , and @xmath84ev .",
    "in addition , for the metallic leads we choose @xmath85ev close to the wideband limit and the coupling between the leads and the benzene ring is @xmath86ev .",
    "therefore the smallest energy scale in the model is the phonon energy @xmath87 .",
    "the current evaluated at @xmath3k ( the temperature enters through the fermi - dirac distribution functions of the leads ) for the rigid molecule as well as the molecule with the breathing mode is shown in fig.[fig : benz ] . at low bias voltage we observe a suppression of the current due to electron - phonon interactions , reminiscent of the franck - condon blockade ,  @xcite see inset . due to the electron - phonon mediated correlations ( second term in eq.([eq : he ] ) )",
    "the gap in the density of states of the benzene molecule widens considerably .",
    "consequently , the threshold for the current increases to @xmath88ev . above the threshold the current increases stepwise , at voltage differences given by twice the phonon energy @xmath87 , until the next plateau is reached .",
    "the new current pathways are related to the vibrational excitations and the factor 2 is due to the argument @xmath89 in eq.([eq : diff : cond ] ) .",
    "this also manifests in the differential conductance fig.[fig : benz ] and in the differential shot - noise ( d ) through pronounced , equally spaced peaks . at the maxima of the conductance ,",
    "the differential shot - noise , corresponding to the derivative of the current - current correlation for @xmath90 , exhibits dips .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures this is observable for a few low - energy peaks of the phonon branching .",
    "a detailed analysis of the differential conductance shows that the peaks are near the poles of the cluster gf @xmath91 of the decoupled device .",
    "this is reasonable , since the effective coupling @xmath92 is small .",
    "therefore , the impact of @xmath93 stems primarily from its imaginary part which determines the width and the weight of the individual peaks .",
    "so the measurement of these quantities can be used as a diagnostic tool to analyze the device and to extract information about the electronic and phononic excitations . in particular the equidistant peaks in the conductance and",
    "the tips in the differential shot - noise are a fingerprint of the bare vibrational excitations .",
    "one should notice , however , that for general vibrational modes the distance between the peaks does not need to be equidistant , since the electronic excitations will depend on the phonon occupation @xmath94 , due to @xmath95 .",

    "the electron - phonon interaction increases the area of the central diamond and induces a splitting of the lines in the stability diagram .",
    "( c ) fowler - nordheim plots for a few selected values of the gate voltage @xmath8 specified in the legend . data evaluated for @xmath3k .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for increasing temperature the vibrational features are smeared out , since the phonon energy @xmath96mev is rather small and comparable to room temperature @xmath97mev . in fig.[fig : finitet ] , the current , the differential conductance , and the differential shot noise are shown at different temperatures @xmath98k . with increasing temperature the steps in the current are smoothed out and the peaks in the conductance and the differential shot noise decrease significantly . in addition",
    ", the dips in the shot noise vanish .    finally , we study the consequence of orbital gating , where the local on - site energy of the benzene molecule is changed by a gate voltage .",
    "experimentally orbital gating has recently been achieved in ref .  .",
    "the current as a function of the gate voltage @xmath8 and the bias voltage @xmath1 exhibits the celebrated diamond structure centered around the particle - hole symmetric point @xmath99v , fig.[fig : sd ] . as compared to the rigid molecule , see fig.[fig : benz](d ) , the area of the center diamond is increased due to the electron - phonon interactions and the transition between the diamonds involve several steps , best visible in the stability diagram , corresponding to the conductance in the @xmath8-@xmath1 plane , shown in fig.[fig : sd ] . the fowler - nordheim plots ( c ) which show @xmath100 as a function of @xmath101 compare well with the experimental observation in ref .  .",
    "from these plots different tunneling regimes become apparent : at low bias voltage , the `` logarithmic '' dependence indicates direct tunneling , whereas for increasing bias voltage the curve has a large negative slope , indicating field emission .  @xcite close to this bias voltage phonon mediated interactions manifest as small wiggles in the curves . when further increasing the voltage the next plateau is reached which is accompanied by a reentrance in the direct tunneling regime . similarly to ref .",
    "the minimum of the curves move to larger bias voltage for increasing gate voltage reflecting the diamond shape of fig.[fig : sd ] and ( b ) .",
    "to summarize , we explored phonon mediated correlation effects on the transport properties of a single benzene molecule .",
    "we focused on an analytically tractable single - mode model that reveals a deeper understanding of the impact of phonons on experimental ( r)iet spectra .",
    "the theoretical approach we presented makes it possible to determine non - equilibrium properties of strongly correlated nano - scale devices .",
    "when solving the interacting device totally numerically , other vibrational modes and electron - electron interactions can be included as well .",
