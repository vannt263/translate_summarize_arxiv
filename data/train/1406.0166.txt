    "[ fe ] hydrogenase @xcite , which features a mononuclear iron complex in the active site , differs in the mode of action compared to [ nife ] and [ fefe ] hydrogenases @xcite . in [ fefe ] and [ nife ] hydrogenases , direct h@xmath0 cleavage or formation is a redox process accomplished by oxidation state changes of the active fe and ni atoms , respectively @xcite .",
    "the reaction catalyzed by [ fe ] hydrogenase , @xmath3 is fundamentally different .",
    "no oxidation - state change of the active iron could be detected experimentally @xcite .",
    "[ fe ] hydrogenase requires the substrate methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 ( see fig .  [",

    "the question is therefore why the iron cofactor iron - guanylylpyridinol ( fegp ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fegp_mpt_lewis ] ) is required for catalysis @xcite even though it does not seem to be redox - active .",
    "the parts of methylene - h@xmath1mpt are denoted according to their chemical building blocks , following ref .  .",
    "both molecules are depicted as parametrized for molecular - dynamics simulations ( the cysteinate ligand is modeled by a methylthiolate).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    an accurate mechanistic description of the h@xmath0 activation process must thus be able to account for the intriguing role of the metal cofactor . yang and hall were the first to investigate the mechanism computationally , using a truncated active - site model in an electrostatic continuum @xcite .",
    "the first main step of the catalytic cycle is the heterolytic h@xmath0 cleavage , with the proton transferred to either the oxypyridine ligand ( deprotonated pyridinol ) or the cysteinate ligand , which need to be present in the deprotonated form .",
    "the second main step is hydride transfer to methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 @xcite , which is the rate - limiting step @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical description with density - functional - theory ( dft ) methods is sensitive to the incorporation of empirical dispersion corrections and the energetics of all elementary reaction steps can be manipulated by first - shell ligand modifications @xcite . yang and",
    "hall formulated the product of h@xmath0 cleavage as a bound dihydrogen species with an elongated , polarized h ",
    "h bond , fe(ii)@xmath4h@xmath5h@xmath6o .",
    "this species is the resting state in their catalytic cycle @xcite .",
    "this intermediate could , however , also be described as a hydride complex @xcite .",
    "the difficulties fully to reconcile the experimental observations with that mechanism , which was derived based on a small model , point to the need for an extended theoretical treatment of the reaction .",
    "any mechanistic proposals should be compatible with the following experimental data : ( i ) if the key intermediate was a stable hydride species , the electronic structure of the fe atom would change . however ,",
    "experimental and theoretical mssbauer spectra indicate that no stable hydride or h@xmath0-bound species exists under turnover conditions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) model compounds that accurately mimic the first coordination sphere of the iron do not even bind h@xmath0 @xcite , hence , the protein environment is likely to be crucial .",
    "( iii ) in model compounds , protonating the thiolate ligand leads to dissociation of the ligand @xcite .",
    "this indicates that also in the enzyme , the thiolate might not be a viable proton acceptor .",
    "( iv ) mutating histidine 14 to alanine reduces the catalytic activity to @xmath7 of the wild - type level @xcite .",
    "the mechanism should thus explain why his14 is important for the catalytic activity .",
    "already in 2009 , hiromoto _ et al .",
    "_  suggested that a large - scale protein motion might play a role in catalysis @xcite .",
    "the dimeric protein has three subunits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qmmm_protein_open_closed ] ) : the central subunit , which is formed from the intertwined c - terminal domains of both monomers , and two identical peripheral subunits @xcite .",
    "the peripheral subunits each harbor an fegp cofactor @xcite ; methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 binds to the central subunit @xcite . the protein can adopt two conformational states , referred to as _ open _ and _ closed _ , respectively . in the _ open _ conformation , there is a cleft between the central and the peripheral subunits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qmmm_protein_open_closed ] @xcite .",
    "hiromoto _ et al .",
    "_  proposed a mechanism where binding of methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 to the _ open _ enzyme induces the transition to the _ closed _ conformation , in which methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 and fegp are arranged such that h@xmath0 binding and cleavage can occur and methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 is reduced to methylene - h@xmath1mpt .",
    "thus , the _ closed _ enzyme is the reactive conformation .",
    "transition back to the _ open _ conformation and dissociation of the product methylene - h@xmath1mpt closes the catalytic cycle .",
    "et al . _  further postulated that the geometrical arrangement of fegp and methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 imposed by the protein in the _ closed _ conformation is necessary for catalysis to occur .    to model the reaction accurately",
    ", a method is required that incorporates the geometrical constraints imposed by the protein and , if possible , also the electronic polarization exerted by the environment .",
    "combined quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics ( qm / mm ) fulfils both these requirements @xcite .",
    "a further complication is that a crystal structure of the _ closed _ conformation is only available for the apoenzyme @xcite , while the holoenzyme could only be crystallized in the _ open _ conformation @xcite .",
    "a crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with the substrate is available only for the c176a mutant in the _ open _ conformation .",
    "thus , suitable starting structures for the wild - type holoenzyme  substrate complex in the _ open _ and _ closed _",
    "conformations must be devised first .    to investigate the crucial h@xmath0 cleavage step , we generated such starting structures of the enzyme  substrate complex in the _ open _ and _ closed _ conformations .",
    "in the subsequent molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations , the fegp cofactor and methylene - h@xmath1mpt ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : fegp_mpt_lewis ] ) were parametrized with the general amber force field ( gaff ) @xcite .",
    "we chose to simulate the enzyme ",
    "product complex because methylene - h@xmath1mpt is more straightforward to parameterize with gaff than methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 .",
    "according to the principle of microscopic reversibility @xcite , this corresponds to the product structure directly after hydride transfer , and the sampled configurations are relevant for both reaction directions .",
    "the fe atom , both co ligands , the cysteinate s atom , the acyl co of the pyridinol ligand , and the oxygen atom of the bound water were positionally restrained to avoid the need for fe ",
    "l bonded parameters .",
    "as fegp is strongly bound to the peripheral subunit , these restraints effectively lock the hinge motion that would interconvert _ open _ and _ closed _ conformations .",
    "however , this conformational change is likely to take place on a time scale much longer than the sampling times used here .",
    "the protein was described with the amber ff03 force field @xcite .",
    "md simulations were run with gromacs 4.5.5 @xcite ( _ open _ conformation : @xmath8 , _ closed _ conformation : @xmath9 ) .",
    "starting from snapshots of the md trajectory , the h@xmath0 splitting reaction was investigated by qm / mm calculations .",
    "these were performed with chemshell @xcite interfaced to turbomole @xcite as qm back - end .",
    "qm calculations used the tpss - d3 @xcite dft method with the def2-tzvp @xcite basis set for iron and the def2-svp @xcite basis set on all other atoms .",
    "the effect of a larger basis set was assessed for one reaction step and the differences in energies and structures were found to be negligible .",
    "details on model construction and computational methods can be found in the electronic supporting information ( esi ) .",
    "herein , we use a full model of the dimeric enzyme in molecular - dynamics simulations and qm / mm calculations to address two central questions relating to the h@xmath0-activation mechanism in [ fe ] hydrogenase .",
    "these are the protonation state of the fegp cofactor and the possible h@xmath0-activation pathways in the _ closed _ conformation .",
    "the md simulations of the dimer with both monomers in the _ open _ conformation yield insights into the dynamics around the cofactor in this non - reactive conformation . the methylene - h@xmath1mpt molecules ( one bound to each monomer ) stay attached to the central subunit of the protein throughout the simulation , mainly due to hydrogen - bonding interactions . most of these interactions were already identified in the crystal structure @xcite and remained largely stable throughout the md trajectory .",
    "important hydrogen bonds are formed between the 2a - amino group of the pterin unit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qmmm_h4mpt_two_conformations ] ) to the backbone carbonyls of thr317 and cys250 .",
    "the carbonyl group of cys250 also forms a hydrogen bond with the pterin n3h .",

    "however , the oxypyridine plays an additional , crucial role in activating h@xmath0 : it is close to the iron atom and represents an ideal lewis base . on the other side of the iron is the carbocationic c14a of the substrate methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 , which is an ideal lewis acid .",
    "furthermore , both groups are ionic .",
    "when a hydrogen molecule coordinates to the iron , it is polarized by these charges and subjected to an electronic push ",
    "pull effect exerted by the lewis pair .",
    "the spatial arrangement in the _ closed _ conformation is exactly such that the coordinated h@xmath0 lies in - between c14a@xmath2 and o@xmath33 .",
    "this leads to facile , exothermic heterolytic h@xmath0 cleavage , without involving electron transfers to / from the metal center .",
    "the lewis acid c14a@xmath2 is only present in proximity to fegp when methenyl - h@xmath1mpt@xmath2 is bound in the _ closed _ conformation .",
    "h@xmath0 cleavage in the _ open _ conformation is thus unlikely .",
    "the activation mechanism we have described is reminiscent of hydrogen activation by frustrated lewis pairs @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen - bound adduct does not need to be very stable since the h@xmath0 cleavage barrier is extremely low ( about @xmath63 ) .",
    "hence , any h@xmath0 binding event can directly lead to h@xmath0 cleavage , without requiring a long - lived h@xmath0-bound intermediate .",
    "when the pyridinol ligand is not deprotonated , it is still possible to split h@xmath0 _ via _ proton transfer to the thiolate ligand .",
    "however , we have found this pathway to be much less favorable .",
    "this is consistent with observations in biomimetic model complexes that thiol is a poor ligand @xcite .",
    "the pyridinol / oxypyridine equilibrium must be strongly affected by the ph , so we would expect the reactivity to depend critically on ph as well , which is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "the atomistic mechanism of h@xmath0 activation in [ fe ] hydrogenase we have proposed herein satisfies the criteria set out in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] : no stable hydride intermediate ; no occurrence of , or requirement for , a long - lived h@xmath0 adduct ; no involvement of the thiolate ligand as a proton acceptor ; a crucial role for his14 . in our preferred mechanism ,",
    "the pyridinol hydroxyl group and his14 , together with the stable placement of the substrate carbocation in the active site , are the essential players , which is in accord with the observation that the enzyme looses @xmath64 of its activity upon h14a mutation @xcite .",
    "the residual activity of the h14a mutant can be explained by the alternative , less favorable activation pathway _ via _ the thiolate ."
