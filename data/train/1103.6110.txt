    "a lorentz system  is a dynamical system  of a point particle moving inertially in an unbounded domain ( in this paper we consider only planar domains ) endowed with an infinite number of dispersing ( i.e. , locally convex ) scatterers . when the particle hits a scatterer , which is regarded as infinitely massive , it undergoes an elastic collision : the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence .",
    "the most popular such system  is undoubtedly the lorentz gas , devised by lorentz in 1905 @xcite to study the dynamics of an electron in a crystal ; the term ` gas ' was introduced later in the century , when versions of the lorentz model were used to give a statistical description of the motion of a molecule in a gas .    in the past century , lorentz systems have been preferred models in the fields of statistical physics , optics , acoustics , and generally anywhere the diffusive properties of a chaotic motion were to be investigated . throughout this history , for reasons of mathematical convenience , the models that were studied most often and",
    "most deeply were _ periodic _",
    "( i.e. , the configuration  of scatterers was invariant for the action of a discrete group of translations ) and with _ finite horizon _",
    "( i.e. , the free flight was bounded above ) .",
    "only recently have aperiodic lorentz systems come to the fore @xcite ( within the scope of dynamical systems , that is , aperiodic models had already been studied in other contexts ; e.g. , @xcite ) . however , while there is a considerable literature on infinite - horizon periodic lorentz gases , almost nothing is known , at least to these authors , on aperiodic lorentz systems with infinite horizon .    in this note",
    "we consider 2d lorentz gases and also lorentz tubes , that is , lorentz systems confined to a strip of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we construct billiards that have infinite horizon and possess the ergodicproperties that one would expect of these chaotic systems , such as ergodicity and strong mixing properties . for these infinite - measure  preserving dynamical systems ,",
    "it turns out that ( poincar ) recurrence is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition for ergodicity ; this is a consequence of the hyperbolic  structure that our systems can be shown to have @xcite . as for mixing ,",
    "since a universally accepted definition of mixing is not available in infinite ergodic  theory ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) , we characterize this aspect of the dynamics by proving that certain first - return maps are @xmath0-automorphisms ( which implies strong mixing ) .",
    "this is again a consequence of recurrence and hyperbolicity .",
    "another important question that we aim to discuss is that of the typicality of such ergodic  properties .",
    "one would expect that , when the effective dimension is one ( lorentz tubes ) or two ( lorentz gases ) , recurrence , and all the stochastic properties that it entails , hold for `` most '' systems ( and one would expect the former case to be more easily worked out than the latter ) .",
    "we address this question by introducing the following two classes of billiards . a strip and the plane",
    "are partitioned into infinitely many congruent _",
    "cells_. in each cell we place a configuration  of _ dispersing _ scatterers , i.e. , a finite union of piecewise smooth closed sets , whose smooth boundary components are seen as convex from the exterior .",
    "the set of all the _ global _ configurations of scatterers gives rise to a family of dynamical systems of the same type .",
    "a natural distance between two configurations can be defined , which makes the above set a metric space .",
    "furthermore , if the configuration  is chosen according to a probability  law , the family becomes a measured family , or an _ ensemble _ , of dynamical systems .",
    "this structure is often referred to as a _ quenched random dynamical system_.    in the case of the tubes we give fairly explicit sufficient conditions for the above - mentioned ergodic  properties , thus proving that , for many reasonable random  laws on the `` disorder '' ( including all non - degenerate bernoulli measures ) , such properties hold almost surely in the ensemble ; we state these results in section [ sec - tubes ] . for the harder case of the gases ,",
    "we prove that the set of the ergodic  systems is uncountable and dense within the whole space ; this is described in section [ sec - gases ] .",
    "outlines of the proofs are given in section [ sec - proofs ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the billiards we construct have infinite but _ locally finite _ horizon , that is , though the free flight has no upper bound , no straight line exists that intersects no scatterers .",

    "( a fairly accurate summary of the whole proof is given in @xcite , although that article refers to lts in dimension higher than two . ) here we limit ourselves to mentioning which parts of the proof can be worked out using the standard techniques for classical hyperbolic  billiards @xcite and which ones need to be adapted to our particular infinite - measure  system .",
    "focusing on the hyperbolicity first , it can be seen that all the arguments used in the proof of theorem [ thm1]_(a ) _ , with one exception , are local , that is , depend on the value of @xmath39 ( its invariant cones , its distortion coefficients , etc . )  on a neighborhood of a given point , or a given  . in other words",
    ", they can not distinguish between a finite - measure  dispersing billiard  for which everything works well @xcite  or an infinite - measure  one .",
    "the only argument that is not local is the one whereby @xmath41-almost all s stay sufficiently far away from the singular points of @xmath39 ( so that the singularities of the map do not interfere with the construction of the local stable and unstable manifolds ) .",
    "the singular points are organized in smooth curves , called _",
    "singularity lines_. each such line corresponds to all the line elements whose first collision occurs at a given corner of @xmath154 , or tangentially to a certain smooth component of it .",
    "hence , there are a countable number of singularity lines",
    ". they can be counted ( or at least overestimated ) in a way that , in each region of the phase space @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is a smooth portion of the boundary as in ( a1 ) , there are at most two singularity lines for every source of singularity ( a vertex or a tangency ) `` seen '' from @xmath156 .",
    "( the factor 2 comes from the fact that there are two ways to be tangent to a smooth boundary , one for each orientation . ) also , the length of each singularity line is bounded above by a universal constant having to do with the size of the cell .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath157 the singular set of @xmath39 , that is , the union of all the singularity lines described above .",
    "it turns out that , if lemma [ lm - tech ] below holds , almost all s approach @xmath157 no faster than a negative power - law in time ( where by time we mean ` number of collisions ' ) .",
    "this is enough to make the sought argument work @xcite .",
    "moving on to statement _ ( c ) _ , as explained in @xcite , one can exploit a suitable local ergodicity theorem for billiards ( say , the version of @xcite ) , which uses only local arguments except in its most delicate part , the so - called tail bound .",
    "it turns out , however , that a version of the tail bound can be proved for our lts too , if the following result holds ( cf .",
    "sec .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ lm - tech ] there exist constants @xmath158 such that , for any @xmath18 , any @xmath159 , and any @xmath160 , @xmath161 intersects at most @xmath162 singularity lines from @xmath157 .",
    "( in more descriptive terms , each trajectory with initial conditions in @xmath163 may approach at most @xmath162 singularity lines of @xmath39 , in time @xmath164 , and this bound is uniform in @xmath163 , if @xmath163 is not too large . )",
    "let us define @xmath165 , so that @xmath166 is the location of the blocking cell to the right of the @xmath71 non - blocking factor , on the right side of the tube w.r.t .",
    "@xmath72 ; while @xmath167 is the location of the blocking cell to the left of the @xmath71 non - blocking factor , on the left side of the tube ; cf .  definition ( [ gj - pm ] ) .",
    "it follows from the hypotheses of theorem [ thm1 ] that both sequences @xmath168 are bounded by a power - law in @xmath104 .",
    "coming to the statement of the lemma , we may assume that @xmath169 ( in fact , proving the result for @xmath170 automatically proves it for @xmath163 ; then , choosing @xmath171 is no loss of generality because a translation of the tube does not change our argument  cf .",
    "remark [ rmk1 ] ) .    by ( a5 ) ,",
    "the configuration space trajectories of length @xmath164 , with initial conditions in @xmath172 , can not go further left than the cell @xmath173 or further right than @xmath174 .",
    "the corresponding phase space s are thus contained in @xmath175 a line element in @xmath176 can `` see '' at most those cells that range from @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , the number of singularity lines of @xmath39 in each set of the type @xmath179 ( @xmath180 was defined earlier ) does not exceed @xmath181 , for some @xmath182 .",
    "but there are at most @xmath183 sets of that type .",
    "the product of these two estimates , which , as shown earlier , grows no faster than a power - law in @xmath164 , is an upper bound for the number of singularity lines from @xmath157 in @xmath176 .",
    "once we have local ergodicity ( all but countably many points in phase space have a neighborhood contained in one ergodic  component ) , global ergodicity is easily shown . also , the assertion about the @xmath0-mixing first - return map is proved as in @xcite , sec .",
    "let us endow @xmath106 with the norm @xmath184 ( this set resembles the border of a rhombus in @xmath106 ) .",
    "given @xmath185 , define @xmath186 and @xmath187 in other words , @xmath188 is the set of all the global configurations which have `` blocking circles '' ( namely , circles filled with cells of type @xmath130 ) at all radii @xmath189 , with @xmath190 . clearly , @xmath191 in a natural sense .",
    "note that @xmath192 and that @xmath193 is dense in @xmath125 . in each @xmath188",
    "we apply the method of @xcite to construct a @xmath194 dense set @xmath195 of recurrent lorentz gases .",
    "let us sketch this method .    in what follows , whenever we mention circles , balls , annuli , we will always mean circles , balls , annuli in @xmath106 ,",
    "relative to the norm @xmath196 and centered in the origin .",
    "fix @xmath124 and denote by @xmath197 a configuration  of cells in a ball of @xmath198 , equivalently , a vector of @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the restriction to @xmath198 of a ball in @xmath106 ; @xmath200 will be referred to as the _ support _ of @xmath197 .",
    "clearly , there are countably many such ( finite ) configurations , so we can index them as @xmath201 ( the dependence on @xmath124 is suppressed ) .",
    "for each such @xmath153 , let us construct a finite configuration  @xmath202 such that :    * the support of @xmath202 is a ball of radius @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is radius of the support of @xmath205 , and the restriction of @xmath202 to the support of @xmath205 is @xmath205 ; * there exists a positive integer @xmath206 such that , if @xmath207 , @xmath208 , i.e. , there is a `` blocking annulus '' ( of type @xmath130 ) of radii @xmath209 ; @xmath210 must be so large that the phase space measure  of all the line elements based in the inner circle of the annulus , whose trajectories reach the outer circle before coming back to inner circle , does not exceed @xmath143 ; * @xmath211 and , for @xmath212 with @xmath213 , @xmath214 , i.e. , the outer part of the configuration @xmath202 ( except for the blocking circles @xmath215 , which do not belong to @xmath198 ) is a non - blocking annulus ( of type @xmath216 ) with thickness @xmath217 .    then ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath218 the cylinder in @xmath188 defined by all the configurations in @xmath198 that coincide with @xmath202 on its support .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath218 is open in @xmath188 w.r.t .",
    "the metric ( [ dist ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath219 is a @xmath194 set that is clearly dense in @xmath188 .",
    "the recurrence of any lg @xmath220 is proved essentially as in section [ subs - pf1 ] , by showing that , if @xmath144 is a wandering set , then @xmath221 , for all @xmath222 and @xmath153 large enough .",
    "also , the construction of the non - blocking annulus in each @xmath202 and the hypothesis on the non - blocking horizontal constant factors ( cf .  theorem [ thm2 ] ) imply that @xmath29 has infinite horizon .    the presence of the blocking circles @xmath215 is necessary to ensure that the set of all the trajectories with initial positions , say , in @xmath118 , stay confined , within time @xmath223 , to a portion of the lg that comprises at most @xmath224 cells , for some @xmath158 .",
    "this makes the equivalent of lemma [ lm - tech ] hold , which in turn yields hyperbolicity , ergodicity and the other statements of theorem [ thm2 ] .",
