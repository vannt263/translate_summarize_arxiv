    "the production of hadrons with large transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) is dominated by the fragmentation of quarks and gluons , produced in parton - parton scatterings with large momentum transfer @xmath2 .",
    "the production cross section for this hard scattering depends on the initial distribution of partons in the colliding species , the elementary parton - parton cross section and the fragmentation process of partons into hadrons .    in absence of any medium effects",
    "the production of high @xmath3 particles in au+au and d+au collisions should be comparable to the production in p+p after scaling with a geometrical factor which reflects the increased number of scattering centers .",
    "the geometrical factor for a given centrality is usually expressed in terms of the _ nuclear overlap function _",
    "@xmath4 or the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath5 . the comparison of different colliding species or centralities to the p+p reference",
    "is done with the _ nuclear modification factor _ :",
    "@xmath6    if the model of geometrical scaling from p+p to other colliding species is valid , the nuclear modification factor should be unity above a certain @xmath3 where hard scattering is dominant .",
    "in contrast to this expectation the results for au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) showed a suppression of up to a factor of five in the nuclear modification factor @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the observed suppression is a result of parton energy loss in a dense medium like the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "however , with only au+au collisions it is hardly possible to distinguish between final state effects and effects of cold nuclear matter at @xmath7gev ( initial state effects ) .",
    "initial state effects can influence the particle production in various ways .",
    "a modification of the parton distribution function in a nucleus can result in a suppression or enhancement of particle production , depending on the momentum fraction @xmath8 of the scattered parton ( _ shadowing _ or _ anti - shadowing _ ) .",
    "multiple soft scattering of incoming nucleons or partons leads to an enhancement at intermediate @xmath1 ( _ cronin effect _ ) .",
    "such effects are also present in d+au collisions , while no large volumes with increased energy density are formed .",
    "these reactions have been studied in early 2003 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and first results have been published in @xcite , showing the absence of suppression in minimum bias reactions at mid - rapidity",
    ".    the examination of d+au collisions also tests whether more exotic phenomena , e.g. the possible formation of a _ color glass condensate _ ( cgc ) in the initial state at @xmath9  gev can be responsible for the observed suppression in central au+au collisions . in this case the nuclear modification factor in d+au should also show a decrease with centrality and a @xmath10 below unity in central d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the data we present were collected in two different rhic runs . in 20012002 au+au collisions at @xmath9  gev and in early 2003 d+au collisions at the same energy were studied .",
    "the phenix central arm detectors used in this analysis provide a solid angle coverage of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "they have the capability of identifying neutral pions and charged hadrons over a broad momentum range @xcite .",
    "neutral pions are reconstructed via their 2@xmath13 decay channel , using an invariant mass analysis of the photon pairs measured in the phenix electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "the combinatorial background of the invariant mass analysis is determined by a _",
    "mixed event _ technique using photon pairs from different events but similar multiplicity and vertex position .",
    "the raw @xmath14 spectra are corrected for geometrical acceptance and multiplicity dependent reconstruction and efficiency losses .",
    "the data set used for the @xmath14 analysis in au+au consists of 30  m minimum bias events and a newly incorporated data set of high - energy photon triggered events which corresponds to an additional 50  m minimum - bias events .",
    "the enlarged data set extends the @xmath1 reach up to 10  gev/@xmath15 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pro_pi0_spectra_auau ] ) for all centralities compared to the result in @xcite . in the analysis of the d+au",
    "run 16  m minimum - bias events have been combined with an equivalent of 100  m minimum - bias events from a high-@xmath1 photon triggered data set , resulting in the measurement of @xmath16 s up to 10  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "charged particles are tracked through the phenix central arms by pad chambers and drift chambers .",
    "particle momenta are reconstructed by their deflection in an azimuthaly symmetric magnetic field with a precision of @xmath17/(gev/@xmath15 ) using tight matching criteria in the pad chambers to reduce the background .",
    "the data sets analyzed were 27  m minimum - bias events in au+au and 12  m events in d+au , which allows to study unidentified charged particles in a broad momentum range ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pro_charged_spectra_dau ] and @xcite ) .    to calculate the nuclear modification factor the phenix p+p @xmath14 spectrum",
    "is used @xcite . in case of the charged particles",
    "these data were scaled by a factor of 1.6 to account for the known abundance of total charged particles over @xmath14 s and combined with the data from ua1 for charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "the result for different centralities is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_cent_dep ] for au+au and d+au . in very peripheral collisions",
    "charged particle and neutral pion yields are consistent with the expectation from binary scaling in both colliding systems . going to more central collisions the suppression gets stronger in au+au , in contrast to the situation in d+au where the particle production is enhanced compared to the expectation from binary scaled p+p .",
    "another interesting observation in central collisions is the difference between charged hadrons and neutral pions in both colliding systems .",
    "this is mainly due to an anomalous p/@xmath18 ratio at intermediate @xmath1 . for further discussion see also @xcite",
    "we have presented results on the centrality dependent production of neutral pions and charged hadrons in d+au and au+au collisions at @xmath9  gev .",
    "the d+au measurement provides the baseline for effects of cold nuclear matter at mid - rapidity for this energy .",
    "the absence of suppression in d+au collisions shows that the suppression observed in central au+au collisions can not be attributed to initial state effects , like shadowing or the formation of a color glass condensate .",
    "the observation supports the picture of a medium induced energy loss .",
