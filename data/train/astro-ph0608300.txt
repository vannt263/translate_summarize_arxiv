    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the magellanic clouds have been employed very successfully over the past few decades to investigate a number of very important astrophysical questions , including chemical abundances in the ism of these galaxies , abundance yields of low - mass stars , the kinematical properties of the host galaxies , and even the extra - galactic distance scale . in the past two decades",
    "a number of investigators have turned their attention to understanding the individual nebulae in detail in an effort to improve our understanding of stellar evolution , chemical enrichments , and the formation and evolution of the nebulae themselves .",
    "the effects of stellar evolution through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) on the galactic pn abundances and on the central star ( cs ) mass and evolutionary paths have been well studied .",
    "however , recent modelling of the co - evolution of pne and their central stars @xcite shows that the pn detectability and many of the observed properties of the pne are intimately tied to the post - agb evolution of the cs .",
    "planetary nebulae are in many ways complex phenomena",
    ". theories of their origin , morphology , chemical composition , evolution , and their use in inferring the evolutionary state of their css are complex and generally rich in their predictive power .",
    "exploring their validity requires samples that are well populated , volume- and flux - complete , and uniformly observed in order to assure that the full set of observable phenomena are represented . for these purposes",
    "the study of magellanic cloud planetary nebulae ( mcpne ) is potentially ideal : the magellanic clouds are massive enough that large numbers of pne are available for study ; the nebulae within a given cloud all lie at essentially the same distance ; the nebulae are bright enough that high quality spectra can be obtained easily , yet they are distant enough that the whole nebula can be fit within typical spectroscopic apertures ; they are near enough that they can be resolved in considerable detail with the best resolution telescopes ( such as _ hst _ or modern ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics ) ; and the foreground extinction is very low .",
    "what has most limited the observational study of critical nebular and cs properties ( and their correlation with nebular morphology ) in the magellanic clouds up until the begining of this decade has been the comparatively small number of nebulae with high resolution images .",
    "_ hst _ imagery of mcpne began with gto program 1046 by @xcite , and was followed up by more than a dozen others , which are listed in table  [ surveys ] .",
    "reference keys to papers that analyze pn properties based on the _ hst _ programs are given in the last column of the table .",
    "unfortunately , the six earliest programs were executed with the spherically aberrated _ hst _ , prior to the first servicing mission , which limits the utility of the data .",
    "@xcite summarized the observations of the 17 lmc and 10 smc pne from the first seven programs and expanded the analysis of these data to study the pn morphologies .",
    "more comprehensive imaging surveys followed in the next few _",
    "hst _ observing cycles , most of which were conducted as snapshot programs , as described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  iii ) .",
    "these surveys expanded the available sample to 59 pne in the lmc and 37 in the smc , including some pne from prior programs that were re - observed with stis .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "programs described in this paper , including one of lmc pne ( cycle 9 , program 9077 ) , and one of the smc pne ( cycle 13 , program 10251 ) , extend earlier work and provide imagery on 54 lmc pne and five smc pne . other , mostly serendipitous _ hst _ observations from various programs have added images of another five lmc pne and one additional smc pn . in sum , these contributions to the _ hst _ archive provide the most complete dataset on extra - galactic pn morphology achieved to date , with imaging of 114 unique pne in the lmc and 35 unique pne in the smc .",
    "the observational data , including the images and the emission line fluxes , are described in   2 , and the nebular dimensions , morphology , and detailed features are described in   3 .",
    "we analyze the lmc and smc nebular properties in   4 , and",
    "summarize our conclusions in   5 .",
    "the data presented here from go programs 9077 and 10251 were obtained with _",
    "hst _ using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "see @xcite for a description of the instrument , and @xcite for a description of the initial , on - orbit performance .",
    "the observing approach and instrument configuration are almost identical to that described in paper  i. briefly , the targets were scheduled as snapshot exposures , which meant that the actual observations were selected on the basis of expediency for the telescope scheduling system , and on the availability of visits with suitable durations .",
    "all known , yet unobserved lmc pne were potential targets for program 9077 ( i.e. , 224 visits were granted for program 9077 ) , though only a modest fraction were actually observed . in practice , brighter targets with short exposure times were observed much more often than fainter targets requiring longer visits . for program 10251 where 53 visits were approved ( in order to observe all smc pne within @xmath25 mag of the brightest ) , only five relatively bright targets were observed prior to the failure of the stis instrument .",
    "this introduces a significant bias when attempting to draw conclusions about the full sample of lmc pne ( see   4 ) .",
    "all of our observations were made with the ccd detector , using a gain of 1 @xmath3/adu .",
    "most of our exposures were split into two components of equal duration to facilitate cosmic ray removal .",
    "we obtained slitless spectra with the g430 m and g750 m gratings which yielded monochromatic images of the target nebulae in several important emission lines .",
    "we also obtained direct , broad - band images with the clear ( 50ccd ) aperture in order to measure central star ( cs ) magnitudes as faint as @xmath4 with a short exposure , and to distinguish between the spatial and the velocity structure in rapidly expanding nebulae .",
    "the fraction of cs detections with this technique is close to 65% @xcite .",
    "the observing log is presented in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the calibration procedure is nearly identical to that described in paper  i , except that more recent versions of the processing software were employed .",
    "the instrumental signature was removed from the images and spectral images with the stis calibration pipeline , version 2.18 ( 2005 jan . ) , as initially described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this portion of the processing substracts the bias , corrects for hot pixels by scaling and subtracting dark exposures , and divides by a normalized flat - field image to correct for pixel - to - pixel variations in detector sensitivity .",
    "the pipeline also combines multiple exposures , using an anti - coincidence technique to remove cosmic ray trails and other transient artifacts .",
    "a noteworthy improvement to this version of the pipeline , compared to that used for papers i , ii , and iii , is the correction for charge transfer ( in)efficiency @xcite , the effects of which grow slowly in time owing to the degradation of the stis ccd detectors in flight .",
    "a recent search of the _ hst _ archive has uncovered a few images in the vicinity of known mcpne , most of which were observed as a part of pure parallel programs .",
    "we have analyzed five additional nebulae ( one of which was imaged during an acquisition for a stis spectroscopic program ) and include the results in this paper .",
    "the observing log of these other programs is presented in table  [ serendip ] .",
    "these images , with the exception of that for lmc  ma  17 , were calibrated with the standard reduction pipelines for the instruments used to obtain them .",
    "these pipelines perform essentially the same corrections as that for our stis images : bias correction , dark scaling and subtraction , and flat - fielding .",
    "in addition , the acs pipeline performs a geometric rectification . for the present purpose",
    "we are concerned primarily with determining the coordinates , sizes , and morphologies of these nebulae , so that the accuracy of the reductions is not so important .",
    "however we did combine images taken with the same filter , when available , to eliminate cosmic rays and to improve the signal - to - noise ratio for presentation .",
    "extraction of one - dimensional spectra from the stis two - dimensional spectral images proceeded similarly to that described in paper  ii . for this purpose",
    "we used the x1d module of the stis pipeline @xcite ; the key parameters that define the extraction ( the position and size of the extraction window ) are given in table  [ spextr ] .",
    "a noteworthy improvement to this module since papers  ii and iii were published was the implementation of a correction for the slow degradation of the detector sensitivity with time @xcite .",
    "prior to extraction , the two - dimensional images were filtered to remove image artifacts , such as the effects of extreme charge traps ( pixel values below @xmath5 electrons ) and incomplete corrections for hot pixels ( isolated pixels with values of a few hundred electrons above that for adjacent pixels ) in the immediate vicinity of emission features .",
    "these corrections to tens to perhaps a few hundred pixels have no effect on the flux calibration , but do have the effect of improving the realized signal - to - noise ratio in the extracted spectra for weak emission features . the fluxes from each of the detected emission lines",
    "were measured from the extracted spectra using the iraf task * splot*. all of the fluxes were measured via direct integration above the local continuum , rather than assuming an intrinsic ( e.g. , gaussian ) shape to the emission profile , because of the often complex spatial profile of the nebulae .",
    "the emission line intensities are presented in table  [ flux ] , uncorrected for interstellar reddening , and are normalized to f(h@xmath6)=100 .",
    "column  1 gives the nebula name using the widely - used designation of @xcite where possible , and otherwise by the original discovery catalog @xcite .",
    "column 2 gives the log of the flux in h@xmath6 @xmath14861 in erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 , and column 3 gives the extinction constant , _ c _ ( the logarithmic extinction at h@xmath6 ) as computed from our f(h@xmath0)/f(h@xmath6 ) ratio and assuming an electron temperature of 10,000  k and density of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the intensities for the bright nebular emission lines , relative to h@xmath11 , are given in columns 4 through 14 .",
    "blends of emission lines that occur for large nebulae are noted in the table , in which case the sum of the line intensities in the blend is given .",
    "we expect the accuracy and associated uncertainties of our relative fluxes to be very similar to those described in papers  ii and iii , since the techniques for spectral extraction , calibration and flux measurement are nearly identical .",
    "since the sample of magellanic cloud pne presented here and in papers  ii and iii is now fairly large it is useful to compare our absolute fluxes to those in the literature , all of which are from ground - based data .",
    "we present in figure  [ flxcmp ] a comparison of the published fluxes with ours in the [ ] @xmath15007 emission line ( scaling by the published absolute flux in h@xmath6 where necessary ) .",
    "the sample of mcpne in common spans about two orders of magnitude in flux .",
    "usually the agreement is very good , though in several cases ( particularly for log fluxes less than @xmath12 ) the agreement is poor .",
    "some objects which were observed by more than two investigators are connected by thin vertical lines . in these cases",
    "it is clear that most of the most discrepant values are inaccurate .",
    "of all the published fluxes with targets in common , those of @xcite cover the largest dynamic range . on the whole",
    "the agreement is good , but the deviations for individual nebulae are sometimes more than a factor of three , almost independent of the brightness . objects in common with @xcite also show good agreement over a wide range , except for one extremely discrepant object ( smc  j  23 ) where the difference is a factor of 100 .",
    "the greatest overlap of objects is with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , jwc ) where the agreement for objects brighter than @xmath13 in the log is excellent , apart from a consistent offset of about 10% , as shown in figure  [ flxcmpb ] .",
    "the cause of the offset , where the jwc fluxes are consistently brighter than ours , is not entirely clear . for ground - based data the principal challenges to accuracy are the photometricity of the observing conditions , and relatively large entrance apertures that can admit a considerable amount of light from background sources .",
    "the light from the background includes field stars and ( often ) significant diffuse emission line radiation that varies with position .",
    "the stis spectra are rather less susceptible to these particular effects , owing to the superior spatial resolution and the large effective entrance aperture ( nearly 1  by 1 ) which both assures that no nebular light is lost , while spreading the background diffuse emission over the whole detector .",
    "it is possible to exclude light inadvertantly from the stis spectra by using virtual extraction slits that are too small . in this case",
    "we would expect to see fluxes that agree with those of jwc for small , nearly unresolved nebulae ( owing to the well calibrated correction in the stis pipeline for finite - aperature effects ) , but that become systematically too small for large nebulae , which we do not find . in any case , the systematic offset is far larger than uncertainty in the measurement errors claimed by jwc , and also larger than that for the absolute accuracy of stis in this mode ( a few percent ) . we conclude that the fluxes from this paper , papers  ii and iii in this series , and those of @xcite and @xcite are the most consistent and likely the most reliable for log fluxes greater than @xmath12 ; below that value our fluxes are probably the most reliable to date .",
    "the broad - band , [ ] @xmath15007 , and h@xmath0 @xmath16563 + [ ] @xmath146548 , 6583 images for the target nebulae of program 9077 are presented in figures  [ neb_1 ] through [ neb_13 ] , and in figure  [ neb_14 ] for the smc nebulae of program 10251 .",
    "images of pne from the other _ hst _ programs are presented in figure  [ neb_15 ] .",
    "all of the data are rendered as grey - scale images , usually with a log intensity scale in order to bring out the often faint structural features .",
    "we classified the morphologies in our sample on the basis of the [ ] @xmath15007 monochromatic images in the g430 m spectra ( although we were guided by the h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath16583 images ) , using the same classification scheme as in papers i and iii .",
    "the morphological types are : round ( r ) , elliptical ( e ) , quadrupolar ( q ) , point - symmetric ( p ) , bipolar ( b ) , and the sub - class of bipolar - core ( bc ) .",
    "the bc designation is applied to nebulae that have a round or elliptical outer contour , but also have internal structure in the form of two lobes of emission that surround the center , and that are at least 20% brighter than the immediately surrounding nebula . when present , such structure is an important morphological feature , in that these nebulae may be more closely related to pure bipolar ( b ) pne than either r or possibly e ( see   4 , below ) .",
    "our distinction between e and r was based ( somewhat arbitrarily ) on whether the major axis of the 10% intensity contour exceeded the minor axis by more than 10% .",
    "other important structural features , such as attached shells , ansae , and jets were noted as well .",
    "the morphological class was assigned primarily on the basis of structures evident in the [ ] image , and would seldom have been different had we instead used another , lower - ionization line such as [ ] @xmath16583 . indeed , in only one case ( out of 61 resolved nebulae ) , for lmc ",
    "smp  62 , might the classification have been different .",
    "we conclude that at least for the broad morphological characteristics considered here , only the [ ] @xmath15007 image is essential for a correct classification with this schema",
    ". a refined classification to quantify the effects of projection may now be possible @xcite , but a significant improvement would require spatially resolved , high - resolution spectra to understand the velocity field of the gas .",
    "table  [ morph ] gives detailed information for the pne presented here .",
    "the sky coordinates are given in columns 2 and 3 , and the photometric radii are given in column 4 , which were derived according to the method described by @xcite .",
    "the photometric radius , r@xmath15 , corresponds to the size of a circular aperture that contains 85% of the flux in [ ] @xmath15007 .",
    "r@xmath15 gives an objective measurement of nebular angular size which is insensitive to the s / n ratio of the image , and is useful for evolution studies .",
    "the nebular diameters , given in column 5 , were measured with respect to the 10% intensity contour of the outermost structure , and are useful for conducting follow - on observations of the pne .",
    "the morphological classification is given in column 6 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we have observed 54 pne in the lmc and five nebulae in the smc .",
    "in addition , we have analyzed archived images of an additional five pne in the lmc and one in the smc .",
    "we describe in this subsection the morphological details and noteworthy spectral features for each nebula listed in table  [ morph ] .",
    "we take special note of objects that show extreme ratios of f([])/f(h@xmath0 ) : often this occurs for large objects . in these cases",
    "the lines are partially blended ( see table  [ flux ] ) , so that the ratio ( or a limit ) is determined only approximately from unblended portions of the emission .",

    "the cs is displaced about 025 ( 0.06 pc ) along the major axis of the ellipse , near the eastern edge of the nebula , and might have been mistaken for a field star were it not for the associated emission .",
    "the core of the cs is saturated in the broad - band image , with a @xmath16 magnitude a little less than 17.6 @xcite .",
    "the nebular emission from the [ ] @xmath16583 line is a few times brighter than that from h@xmath0 , and a faint extension of nebulosity can be seen to the east .",

    "although this _ hst _ sample is seriously incomplete at faint flux levels , the relative number of bipolars is much larger for nebulae fainter than about 2 mag below the brightest .",

    "these properties , and the presence of only one bipolar pn ( in the lmc ) among these nebulae , suggests that few if any of the most luminous mcpne are composed of a post - asymptotic giant branch star and a close accreting white dwarf companion , as asserted by @xcite . in this discussion of the pnlf",

    "@xcite predicted a rather different form for the decline of pn surface brightness with radius .",
    "based on the simple argument that for low density gas the volume emissivity is proportional to the product of the densities of electrons and ions , he argued that the volume emissivity declines as @xmath23 for an expanding nebula of fixed mass , so the average surface brightness of the projected nebula should decline as @xmath24 .",
    "real nebulae are much more complex than this however , and other important factors can have a large impact on the evolution of the emissivity .",
    "these factors include compression of the gas as the fast cs wind impinges on the inner boundary of the main shell , the weak shock associated with the passage of an ionization front through neutral gas , and the progressive ionization of greater amounts of the surrounding neutral gas etc .",

    "it is important to note that , for nebulae with high optical depth , it is the radius of the o@xmath25 zone , not the radius of the mass - bounded shell , that is being measured . even for optically thin nebulae",
    ", r@xmath15 would be defined more by the details of the density profile than by some physical boundary , and in any case it is not necessarily linearly related to the kinematical age of the nebula .",
    "thus the surface brightness relation may be more closely connected to characteristics of the evolution of the pn ionization than to the expansion of the shell per se .    in spite of the simplicity of the surface brightness relation , it is probably not correct to conclude that the trajectory of an individual pn is at all times parallel to the trend line .",

    "[ sb_rad ] lie significantly below the trend , possibly indicating a relatively low ionization parameter .",
    "many of these nebulae , particularly those with radii larger than about log  r@xmath26 , are bipolar .",
    "pn evolutionary models by @xcite and @xcite predict that the most massive css ( which have also lost the most mass on the agb ) will never fully ionize their surrounding gas shells , and the pn will never become optically thin because the cs evolves so quickly to low luminosity .",

    "the figure shows a very clear decline in density with increasing radius , roughly following a @xmath21 power law .",
    "however , for radii larger than log  @xmath28 there are many nebulae , all of which are bipolar ( or similar morphology ) , that lie substantially above the trend defined by the smaller ionized shells .",

    "[ sb_rad ] for log  @xmath29 .",
    "one might naively expect that the density of an individual nebula with constant ionized mass would decline as @xmath21 as the shell expands , but as mentioned above real nebulae are more complex .",
    "for instance , the effects of compression on the inner pn boundary by the fast wind and radiation from the cs would affect the trajectory , as would the initial density contrast between equitorial and polar regions of the proto - pn @xcite when the pn shell was formed .",
    "however , the mean density as measured by the [ ] lines may not be representative of all the gas . that is , the [ ] emissivities will be strongest near the critical density ( 1.43.6@xmath30 @xmath10 ) , so that the measured density will to some degree be intensity weighted , and will depend upon the details of the ionization in the region where density can be measured with s@xmath31 .",
    "but the remarkable appearance of many relatively dense nebulae beyond log  @xmath32 , some of which have modest ionized mass ( @xmath33m@xmath34 ) , suggests that additional effects are in play , at least for bipolars . for nebulae with high optical depth , where the ionization front has not yet progressed through the entire extent of the nebular gas , s@xmath31 is most likely to be detected close to the ionization front ( owing to its low ionization potential ) , and therefore in a region of elevated density . for these reasons one might expect to measure high",
    "[ ] density throughout most of the life of pne with the most massive progenitor stars ( i.e. , those that never fully ionize the surrounding nebulae ) .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that nebulae which remain optically thick would tend to lie above the @xmath21 trend even at large radius . in short ,",
    "we believe the broad properties of bipolar pne presented here : surface brightnesses that lie on or below the @xmath21 trend line , unusually high measured density at large radii , sometimes modest ionized mass , and their correlation ( at least in the galaxy ) with the most massive pn progenitors provide support for the prediction that the most massive css remain optically thick throughout the pn phase .",
    "note that conclusions such as these would not be possible from a sample of pne for which the individual distances are not known accurately , as is typical of current galactic samples .",
    "chemical enrichments in pne , primarily in n and he , have been studied for decades , and their connection to more massive progenitors is perhaps most widely expressed as the peimbert type  i class @xcite .",
    "the association of bipolar morphology in galactic pne with type  i characteristics was first studied in detail by @xcite and @xcite ; kaler noted that a disproportionate number of b nebulae had high values of n / o and elevated he / h , compared to nebulae with other morphologies .",
    "these findings lent support to the connection between b nebulae and more massive progenitors that experience hot - bottom burning , where c is largely converted to n and dredged - up in the progenitor agb star prior to the ejection of the main pn shell . studied the chemical enrichments in lmc pne with known morphologies , and showed that bipolar and bipolar core morphology was correlated with elevated n and depressed c abundances outside of the galactic context .    with our greatly enlarged sample of mcpn with known morphologies , plus measurements of the nebular [ ] line fluxes",
    ", we can gain additional insight into the connection between morphology and chemical enhancements .",
    "figure  [ n2_ha ] shows a cumulative histogram of the ratio of the fluxes in the [ ] @xmath146548 + 6583 lines to that for h@xmath0 ( hereafter , n2/h@xmath0 ) for four morphological types : r , e , bc , and b. the figure includes data for both lmc and smc pne , though if plotted separately the differences would be masked by small number statistics , since the smc has fewer nebulae with known morphology and a lower fraction of bipolars .",
    "the [ ] fluxes are from this paper and from papers  ii and iii where available , or from @xcite .",
    "the plot shows that almost all r nebulae have n2/h@xmath35 , and for all nebulae except one the ratio is less than 0.75 .",
    "( the one exceptional r nebula is barely resolved , and the r classification is uncertain . )",
    "the histograms for the e and bc nebulae are nearly indistinguishable . like the r nebulae",
    "about 20% have n2/h@xmath36 , but from there the curves rise more slowly : about 20% of the nebulae have n2/h@xmath37 , and for 10% of the nebulae",
    "the ratio exceeds 1.5 .",
    "but the most striking feature of the plot is the histogram for b nebulae , where none have a ratio near zero , and only 25% have n2/h@xmath38 . indeed",
    ", most b nebulae have n2/h@xmath39 .",
    "although the n2/h@xmath0 is only a proxy for n abundance , figure  [ n2_n ] shows that it is highly useful as a simple spectral indicator .",
    "a full abundance analysis of this mcpn sample is beyond the scope of this paper , but for the present purpose , nebulae with n2/h@xmath40 ( the bulk of the b nebulae ) almost certainly have an elevated n abundance .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ n2_ha ] provides perhaps the clearest evidence yet of the remarkable difference in chemical enhancements between pn morphological types .",
    "we have presented images and slitless spectra of a final survey with stis of mcpn , which when combined with prior work with _ hst _ , previous surveys that we have carried out , and with a few other , mostly serendipitous observations in the _ hst _ archive , yields the largest sample of resolved extragalactic pne to date .",
    "the broad properties of the mcpn were described , as were the limits to our understanding that can not be addressed further without high - resolution images of flux - complete samples .",
    "this paper also draws some important conclusions about the effects of optical depth in pne , and sets the stage for future observations and modelling that will further our understanding of the evolution of planetary nebulae and their central stars .",
    "an analysis of the properties of the central stars is the subject of another paper @xcite .",
    "there are a number of pne in this sample for which detailed spectra are missing or incomplete .",
    "we have obtained spectra for some of them , from which we will derive essential phyisical information ( such as densities ) , as well as chemical abundances .",
    "more deep , high - resolution images of pne will be required in both the lmc and smc to establish a large and complete sample to a photometric depth that is comparable to those of modern surveys ( i.e. , at least 6 mag of the [ ] luminosity function ) , so that more firm conclusions can be drawn about the range of morphological , physical , and chemical properties of pne .",
