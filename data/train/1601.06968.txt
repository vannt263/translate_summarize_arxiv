    "assumption that the velocities of the colliding particles are uncorrelated and independent of the position of the particles is a key point in the molecular chaos hypothesis .",

    "the lack of correlations assumption is included into the functional form of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy : @xmath2 this assumption works rather well for many classical dynamical systems , in which large number of particles and their interactions helps to mask the existing correlations .",
    "e.g. , after the collision of gas particles the velocities of those particles are no longer uncorrelated , but due to large number of them and , thus , large number of the collisions between them , the correlation quickly becomes forgotten .",
    "yet there are systems in which long - range interactions , long - range memory or non - ergodicity are present . to understand these , sometimes referred to as complex , systems and their apparently anomalous properties a generalization of classical statistical mechanics proposed by tsallis @xcite is used .",
    "this generalized framework has found its applications to extremely different systems studied by both `` hard '' ( e.g. , mathematics , physics , chemistry ) and `` soft '' ( e.g. , economics ) sciences @xcite .",

    "furthermore , in order to conserve @xmath14 , spins belonging to domains containing single spin should not be allowed to flip . if such spin would be allowed to flip , the domains could disappear and @xmath14 would not be conserved .",

    "an effective temperature associated with the non - extensive statistical mechanics and proportional to the density of vortices in type ii superconductors has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have extended the statistical model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that exhibits both extensive behavior of generalized entropy for @xmath0 and a @xmath1-gaussian distribution . assuming that the stochastic temporal dynamics is due to random walk of domain boundaries we have derived the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp-2 ] ) and corresponding sde ( [ eq : sde-2 ] ) describing the evolution of the total spin in time .",
    "although distributions from non - extensive statistical mechanics are more often obtained using nonlinear fokker - planck equations @xcite , our model is well described by a linear fokker - planck equation .",
    "( [ eq : fp-2 ] ) is a particular case of a known class of fokker - planck equations , which have @xmath1-gaussian stationary distributions distributions @xcite .",
    "the proposed temporal dynamics in the model provides insight on how fokker - planck equations with stationary distributions of non - extensive statistical mechanics can arise from microscopic description of the system .",
    "in contrast to the model with uncorrelated spins , presented in section [ sec : uncorrelated ] , the dynamics in the proposed model of correlated spins slow down with the increasing number of spins as @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations of the total spin remain macroscopic even in the limit @xmath11 , whereas in the model with uncorrelated spins the fluctuations decrease as @xmath47 .",
    "these macroscopic fluctuations is one of the reasons for the spectrum of fluctuations of the ratio @xmath121 exhibiting @xmath18 behavior in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "this range of frequencies increases with increasing number of spins @xmath12 .",
