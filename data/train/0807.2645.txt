    "ly@xmath0 radiation pressure may operate throughout the lifetime of the central star . over a lifetime of @xmath150 myr ( see table 4 of * ? ? ?",

    "this conjecture is supported by the tendency of ly@xmath0 photons to preferentially scatter through the low - density gas ; their propagation along the path of least resistance would naturally boost up the ly@xmath0 flux there .",

    "our limited analysis does not allow a detailed discussion on the consequences of these winds .",
    "this requires 3d simulations with cosmological initial conditions that capture the full igm density field around the minihalo and that track the evolution of the shocks that may form in the igm .",

    "furthermore , this galaxy can photoionize a spherical hii region of a radius @xmath176 physical kpc .",
    "note however , that other ionizing sources would likely exist within this hii region . indeed , clusters of sources are thought to determine the growth of ionized bubbles during reionization .",

    "the _ blue dotted ( red solid ) lines _ represent a model in which the supershell has a column density of @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) @xmath194 and a maximum radius that is @xmath201 kpc ( @xmath202 ) kpc .",
    "our calculations assume that there is no neutral gas ( or dust ) interior to the hi supershell .",
    "the _ left panel _ of figure  [ fig : caseiii ] shows that inside the supershell the energy density decreases more gradually than @xmath203 because of photon trapping ( similarly to the previously discussed cases in   [ sec : firststar]-  [ sec : firstgalaxy ] ) .",
    "the shell with the larger column of hi is more efficient at trapping the ly@xmath0 photons , and thus yields a flatter energy density profile . in both models",
    "the energy density drops steeply within the supershell ( the energy density decreases as @xmath203 outside the shell , if no scattering occurs here ) .",
    "the _ right panel _ of figure  [ fig : caseiii ] shows the ratio between the radiation and gravitational forces . towards the center of the dark matter halo ,",
    "baryons dominate the mass density and an evaluation of @xmath204 requires assumptions about the radial distribution of the baryons . for simplicity , we consider a fixed total mass interior to the supershell of @xmath205 , so that @xmath206 .",

    "the _ total _",
    "ly@xmath0 radiation force is obtained by summing the force over all atoms in the supershell .",

    "[ fig : fscat ] we plot the quantity @xmath214 which is defined as @xmath215 as a function of the expansion velocity of the shell , @xmath216 for three different values of @xmath217 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fscat ] shows that @xmath214 , which can be thought of as a force multiplication factor that was introduced by @xcite , as @xmath218 .",
    "here , @xmath30 is the total force that radiation exerts on a medium , @xmath219 is the total optical depth to electron scattering through this medium .",
    "the function @xmath220 arises because of the contribution of numerous metal absorption lines to the medium s opacity , and can be as large as @xmath221 in the atmospheres of o - stars @xcite .",
    "] , greatly exceeds unity for low shell velocities and large hi column densities .",
    "the parameter @xmath214 is related to the mean number of times that a ly@xmath0 photon bounces back and forth between opposite sides of the expanding shell .",
    "for example , @xmath222 when all ly@xmath0 photons enter the shell , scatter once , and then escape from the shell in no preferred direction .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath223 when all ly@xmath0 photons enter the shell , scatter back towards the opposite direction , and then escape in no preferred direction after scattering in the shell for a second time .",
    "a schematic illustration of this argument is provided in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "note that when @xmath222 ( @xmath223 ) , each photon spends on average a timescale of @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) in the bubble enclosed by the shell .",
    "in other words , the factor @xmath214 relates to the trapping time , @xmath9 , that denotes the total time over which ly@xmath0 photons are trapped inside the supershell into the shell .",
    "if this corresponds to a physical distance that is significantly smaller than the thickness of the shell ( denoted by @xmath226 ) , then only a tiny fraction of the photons will diffuse through the shell .",
    "hence , when averaged over these photons , ignoring the time spent inside the supershell itself is justified .",
    "alternatively , photons with a mean free path that is at least comparable to the thickness of the shell , only spend a time @xmath227 inside the supershell , which provides a negligible contribution to the trapping time . ]",
    "( see   [ sec : intro ] ) through the relation @xmath228 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath229 we find that @xmath214 reproduces the value @xmath230 ( indicated by _ horizontal dotted lines _ ) that was found by @xcite and @xcite reasonably well ( keeping in mind that these authors derived their result for a static , uniform , infinite slab of material , and assumed different frequency distributions for the emitted ly@xmath0 photons ) .",
    "we have applied an existing monte - carlo ly@xmath0 radiative transfer code ( described and tested extensively in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the calculation of the pressure that is exerted by ly@xmath0 photons on an optically thick medium .",
    "this code enabled us to perform ( the first ) direct , accurate calculations of ly@xmath0 radiation pressure , which distinguishes this work from previous discussions on the importance of ly@xmath0 radiation pressure in various astrophysical environments .",
    "we have focused on a range of models which represent galaxies at different cosmological epochs . in   [ sec : firststar ] we have shown that the ly@xmath0 radiation pressure exerted on the neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) surrounding minihalos ( @xmath231 ) in which the first stars form , can exceed gravity by 23 orders of magnitude ( fig  [ fig : casei ] ) , and in principle accelerate the gas in the igm to tens of km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , ly@xmath0 radiation pressure can launch supersonic winds in the igm surrounding the first stars .",
    "our analysis did not allow a detailed study of the consequences of these winds .",
    "a comprehensive study would require numerical simulations that capture the full igm density field around minihalos in 3d and track the evolution of the shocks that may form in the igm together with the ly@xmath0 radiative transfer . in this paper",
    ", we have also shown that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure is important in the neutral igm that surrounds the hii regions produced by galaxies with a total halo mass of @xmath190 ( fig  [ fig : caseii ] .",
    "these are the lowest mass , and hence the most abundant , halos in which gas can cool via atomic line excitation . here",
    ", however , the absolute magnitude of the radiation force is too weak to drive the gas to supersonic velocities .",
    "finally , we have shown in   [ sec : wind ] that the ly@xmath0 radiation pressure exerted on neutral gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a galaxy can also have strong dynamical consequences .",
    "in particular , we have found that the ly@xmath0 radiation force exerted on an expanding hi supershell can exceed gravity by orders of magnitude ( fig  [ fig : caseiii ] ) , for reasonable assumptions about the gravitational force .",
    "it is therefore possible that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure plays an important role in determining the kinematics of hi supershells around starburst galaxies .",
    "we have demonstrated that the total ly@xmath0 radiation force on a spherical hi supershell can be written as @xmath232 , where the force - multiplication factor @xmath214 relates to the average trapping time of ly@xmath0 photons in the neutral medium .",
    "the factor @xmath214 can greatly exceed unity , as illustrated by fig  [ fig : fscat ] . for comparison , the maximum possible radiation force due to continuum radiation ) around late - type stars that may significantly exceed @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "this is not because of trapping of continuum photons , but related to the propagation speed of the photons and the wind .",
    "we similarly expect the radiative force of trapped ly@xmath0 photons in steady - state outflows to potentially exceed @xmath234 ( and as argued in this paper , it is possible that @xmath235 ) .",
    "note though that these steady - state outflows are clearly different from those discussed in ",
    "[ sec : wind ] , in which a well defined thin shell hi gas is physically separated from the central ly@xmath0 source . ]",
    "is @xmath236 , in which @xmath237 is the bolometric luminosity of the central galaxy . for a typical star forming galaxy , @xmath238 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas for a galaxy that contains population iii stars , @xmath239 @xcite .",
    "hence , the ly@xmath0 radiation pressure can dominate the maximum possible continuum radiation pressure if @xmath240 ( for a normal stellar population ) , a threshold which is easily exceeded at large column densities of relatively slow - moving hi shells ( see fig  [ fig : fscat ] ) .    the possibility that ly@xmath0 radiation alone can result in a radiation force that exceeds @xmath236 is important .",
    "@xcite have shown that the total momentum carried by radiation from a star - forming region can exceed the total momentum deposited by supernova explosions in it , and so galactic outflows may be driven predominantly by continuum radiation pressure .",
    "we have argued that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure may in some cases be even more important than continuum radiation pressure , and thus provide the dominant source of pressure on neutral hydrogen in the ism .",
    "the important implication of our last result is that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure may drive outflows of hi gas in the ism .",
    "observations of local starburst galaxies have shown that the presence of outflowing hi gas may be required to avoid complete destruction of the ly@xmath0 radiation by dust and to allow its escape from the host galaxies @xcite . at high redshifts ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission line of galaxies is often redshifted relative to other nebular recombination lines ( such as h@xmath0 ) and metal absorption lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the spectral shape of the ly@xmath0 emission line is typically asymmetric , with emission extending well into the red wing of the line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . both of these observations can be explained simultaneously if the observed ly@xmath0 photons scatter off neutral hydrogen atoms in an outflowing supershell of hi gas that surrounds the star forming regions @xcite .",
    "the possibility that ly@xmath0 radiation pressure may be important in determining the properties of expanding supershells is exciting , and is discussed in more detail in a companion paper ( dijkstra & loeb 2008 ) .",
