    "heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath5pt ) applied to the scattering amplitudes for processes involving baryons and mesons has been successful in describing experimental data for a significant number of low - energy meson - baryon interactions @xcite .",
    "this method involves expansion in powers of the momentum for sufficiently low energies . as the number of terms in such expansions grows exponentially with energy , processes reasonably close to threshold",
    "are generally well described by this method .",
    "however , chiral expansions based on hb@xmath5pt encounter a serious problem when they are used in systems with a resonance or bound state at threshold . as such systems possess an s - matrix pole",
    ", the standard low - order expansion techniques of chiral perturbation theory can not provide a satisfactory description . near a resonance the particles can in principle",
    "interact an infinite number of times , producing a characteristic energy dependence which can not be reproduced by a power series with a small number of terms .",
    "one system in which such a state appears is the nn system in the singlet channel , which is strongly affected near threshold by the `` singlet deuteron '' state .",
    "the problem of formulating a consistent chiral expansion for this channel has recently attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "low - energy @xmath6 interactions are also , to a large extent , governed by the subthreshold @xmath3(1405 ) resonance . in the present paper we focus on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems ( where @xmath7 includes the @xmath3 and @xmath8 hyperons ) at low energy .",
    "two methods have been suggested so far to formulate a chiral approach to reactions in the presence of a low - energy or subthreshold resonance . in the first method @xcite ,",
    "one uses just the tree level irreducible diagrams , generated by hb@xmath5pt in leading and subleading order , to construct an effective potential .",
    "this potential is then inserted into the lippmann - schwinger equation , which iterates the effective potential to all orders .",
    "a sufficiently attractive effective potential will generate a resonance when iterated in this manner . using this method kaiser , siegel and weise @xcite were able to generate the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance dynamically , and obtained good fits to experimental data in this nonperturbative scheme .",
    "although iteration of an effective potential allows one to reproduce low - energy interactions in the vicinity of a resonance pole , this represents a substantial departure from hb@xmath5pt methods . in the standard",
    "hb@xmath5pt analysis , all possible amplitudes are evaluated to a given order in the chiral expansion , whereas only ladder diagrams were summed up using the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "second , in chiral expansions one can in principle remove the dependence of low energy constants on the regularization parameter by using the renormalization group equations . using the lippmann - schwinger equation ,",
    "it is necessary to impose a cutoff in order to render the integral part of the lippmann - schwinger equation finite .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the results of calculations depend rather strongly on the value of the cutoff @xcite .",
    "third , as is well known in scattering theory , effective potentials which give identical on - shell results can in principle differ in their off - shell extrapolation , so that the results of the lippmann - schwinger calculations will also depend on the functional form used for the effective potential .    in the second approach , proposed by lee , min and rho @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance is treated from the beginning as an `` elementary '' field which participates on an equal footing with all other quantum fields in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the framework of such an approach one can obtain reasonable threshold branching ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , taking into account only the leading order @xmath9 terms .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite only the lowest order chiral lagrangian was used in the actual calculations , and the authors did not compare their model with experimental data for reaction channels involving an initial - state @xmath6 system . in the present paper",
    "we explore the approach suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the @xmath3(1405 ) is included in the lagrangian as an elementary field .",
    "we take their calculation one step further by including the next - to - leading order terms in the chiral lagrangian , and we compare our results to experimental reaction cross sections near threshold .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian can be written as a sum of terms each of which is proportional to a particular power of the characteristic momentum which we denote @xmath10 . then the physical amplitude can be represented as a power series in @xmath10 .",
    "the chiral counting rules can be used to determine the chiral dimension of the amplitude at any given order .",
    "the leading order terms are linear in @xmath10 , while the next - to - leading terms go as @xmath11 . to this order",
    "the lagrangian we are interested in is given by @xcite    @xmath12    where the leading order term is given by    @xmath13,b ] ) +     ( \\sqrt{2}g_{\\lambda^{*}}\\overline{\\lambda^{*}}tr((v\\cdot a)b ) + h.c.)\\ ] ]    and the next - to - leading order term of the effective lagrangian can be written as follows    @xmath14 ) +                b_0 tr(\\overline{b}b)tr(\\chi_{+ } ) \\nonumber \\\\ +                       & & d_d tr(\\overline{b}\\{a^2+(v\\cdot a)^2,b\\ } ) +   d_f tr(\\overline{b}[a^2+(v\\cdot a)^2,b ] ) +        d_0 tr(\\overline{b}b)tr(a^2+(v\\cdot a)^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\+ & &   d_1 \\left [ tr(\\overline{b}a_\\nu)tr(a^{\\nu}b ) +   tr(\\overline{b}(v\\cdot a))tr((v\\cdot a)b)\\right ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & & d_2 tr\\left[\\overline{b}(a_\\nu ba^\\nu + ( v\\cdot a)b(v\\cdot a))\\right ]   \\label{secord } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we define the chiral covariant derivative @xmath15 $ ] with a chiral connection @xmath16 and axial operator @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are baryon and meson field matrices in standard form @xcite . the matrix @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath5 is the meson mass matrix with the diagonal elements @xmath22 .",
    "the field @xmath23 describes the state @xmath24 introduced as an elementary field with @xmath25 coupling constant @xmath26=0.15 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite this value was extracted from the decay width @xmath27=50 mev for the process @xmath28 .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian @xmath29 describes the @xmath30 corrections .",
    "the form of this term follows directly from the corresponding relativistic expression and does not contain the unknown low - energy constants .",
    "the low - energy constants in front of the terms with the double derivatives and mass terms are not determined by chiral symmetry and must therefore be extracted from the experimental data .",
    "the procedure we used to determine the constants @xmath31 in eq .   [ secord ] is similar to that used in ref .",
    "the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be extracted from the baryon mass splittings . using the @xmath34 relations for the baryon masses one can get the values @xmath35 gev@xmath36 and @xmath37 gev@xmath36 .",
    "the constant @xmath38 can be related to the @xmath39 sigma term . to the order we are interested in ,",
    "this relation is given by @xmath40 in our calculations we used the value @xmath41 gev@xmath36 .",
    "the uncertainty in the value of @xmath38 arises mainly from the uncertainty in the pion - nucleon sigma term    the unknown effective constants @xmath42 associated with the terms with double derivatives in eq .",
    "[ secord ] can be extracted from experimental data .",
    "there are six channels ( @xmath43 ) which can be involved in the dynamics of @xmath6 interactions at low energies .",
    "there are also relations for the isospin - even @xmath39 s - wave scattering length @xmath44 and isospin zero kaon - nucleon s - wave scattering length @xmath45 , which are given by the following expressions @xmath46 and @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the axial vector coupling constant and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the su(3 ) coupling constants which satisfy the relation @xmath51 .",
    "[ aeqn ] puts constraints on the possible values of the effective constants @xmath42 .",
    "we have used the experimental data from refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both scattering lengths are very small : @xmath52 fm and @xmath53 fm .",
    "one notes that in the expression for @xmath44 we have not included the term corresponding to the non - analytic loop correction proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "since we calculate the scattering amplitudes up to order @xmath11 it would not be consistent to include at any point terms stemming from loop corrections which are of order @xmath55 . after imposing the constraints we are left with three undetermined constants .",
    "we fix the remaining constants using the experimental data describing the energy dependence of the total cross sections of the reaction channels with a @xmath6 system in the initial state .",
    "there are six possible final channels altogether , so after fixing three constant we obtain theoretical predictions for three reaction channels .",
    "first , we fix the low - energy constants @xmath42 which appear in eq .",
    "[ secord ] .",
    "we work in the limit of conserved isospin and use the the following masses : @xmath56=139.6 mev , @xmath57=493.6 mev , @xmath58=938.3 mev , @xmath59=1115.6 mev , and @xmath60=1192.5 mev .",
    "a set of low - energy constants @xmath42 which give a reasonable description of the experimental data are given in table i. we compare these constants with the same quantities defined by kaiser _",
    "these authors expand the chiral lagrangian to second order without an elementary @xmath3(1405 ) field .",
    "the resonance is obtained by using the low - order chiral expansion as a potential , and generating the resonance by iterating the potential in the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "although the sign of each term is the same , the absolute values of the effective constants differ considerably from those obtained in ref .",
    "thus , although the results of the two approaches are in good quantitative agreement ( e.g. , the very similar values for the reaction cross sections given in figs .  1 - 6 of this paper , and those of kaiser _ et al .",
    "_ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the coefficients of the corresponding `` expansion constants '' in the lagrangian are very different .",
    "the differences between expansion parameters are not surprising , given the different ansatz regarding the origin of the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance . if one treats the low - order chiral expansion as a potential and iterates it in ladder approximation to obtain the @xmath3(1405 ) , then the expansion constants of ref .",
    "@xcite are appropriate .",
    "if one treats the @xmath3(1405 ) as an elementary field coupled to the @xmath61 system , then the expansion constants of the `` residual '' system are given by our values .",
    "1.5 cm    in figs .  1 - 6",
    ", we compare the results of our calculations of the total cross sections for all channels with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the agreement with experiment is quite reasonable , indicating that the leading and subleading contributions including an explicit @xmath3(1405 ) resonance play a dominant role in the low - energy dynamics of the @xmath62 system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that without the contribution from the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance the probability for the process @xmath63 would be suppressed at leading order .",
    "moreover , the cross sections of other reactions would also be much too low .",
    "the one case where our calculations fails to reproduce experiment is the @xmath64 channel shown in fig .  5 , where our calculated cross section is lower than the experimental data .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance , which is a prominent feature for all other channels , does not contribute to this transition . to bring this cross section closer to the experimental value",
    "will probably require calculating the loop corrections for the reaction @xmath65 .",
    "so , for all reaction channels where the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance contributes , it is an important ingredient in producing a realistic description of the experimental data .",
    "1.5 cm    our predicted cross sections agree favorably with those calculated by kaiser _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "they used the next - to - leading order contribution ( not including an explicit @xmath3(1405 ) field ) as an effective potential , and iterated this to all orders in a lippmann - schwinger equation . by introducing an explicit @xmath3(1405 ) `` elementary '' field , we are able to obtain qualitatively similar results to kaiser _",
    "et al . _ , except for the channel @xmath66 as discussed previously .",
    "1.5 cm    1.5 cm    the other major difference between the two calculations is that the iterated potential results are able to obtain cusps at inelastic thresholds , where we do not obtain cusp behavior .",
    "since we are neglecting @xmath67 corrections , we do not expect our calculations to be able to reproduce subtle features like threshold cusps .",
    "such cusps appear in theoretical calculations as the energy of the incoming kaon crosses the threshold energy of a reaction channel .",
    "threshold cusps have not seen in the experimental data for @xmath68 reactions .",
    "however , the data are characterized by rather large error bars so that cusp singularities could very well be hidden within the present experimental uncertainties .",
    "such cusps have proven notoriously difficult to observe in reaction cross sections .",
    "1.5 cm    1.5 cm",
    "next we make a few remarks concerning the loop corrections . they start to contribute at order @xmath67 and are necessary to ensure unitarity and take into account the effect of coupled channels .",
    "in addition , the @xmath69 and @xmath70(3 ) violating effects should also be included at this order .",
    "however , all one loop corrections in an @xmath70(3 ) multiplet need to be taken into account in a consistent formalism . at present",
    ", such a program would not be feasible since at this order the number of low - energy constants ( needed to absorb divergences of the loop diagrams ) would be much larger than the number of observables available to fix these constants .    in our calculation",
    "we keep the mass of the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance real , _",
    "i.e. _ we treat it as a zero - width resonance .",
    "it would not be consistent to include the width of the @xmath3(1405 ) state since the width arises from loop corrections , and thus is of higher order .",
    "we also keep the coupling constant @xmath71 the same for all channels involved .",
    "this is an exact result in the limit of perfect @xmath70(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the coupling constants in various channels may differ when we include terms of order @xmath67 .",
    "the leading @xmath70(3 ) violating corrections to the coupling constant @xmath71 have been computed in ref .",
    "these corrections reduce the value of the @xmath0 coupling compared to @xmath72 . to evaluate how these corrections affect the results of calculations",
    ", one needs to include all possible one loop corrections . as we noted previously , that is not feasible at present due to the large number of unconstrained constants .",
    "the other interesting physical quantities in low - energy @xmath68 scattering are the threshold branching ratios @xmath73    the experimental values are taken from refs.@xcite and @xcite . in table",
    "ii we show the theoretical results for the branching ratios of eq .",
    "[ ratcalc ] , compared with the experimental values .",
    "the leading order results , of order @xmath74 , were calculated earlier by lee _",
    "they can be compared with our results calculated to order @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account the next - to - leading corrections in the effective chiral lagrangian clearly leads to significant improvement in the theoretical description .",
    "the second order contributions to @xmath76 and @xmath77 constitute 18% and 48% corrections , respectively , to the first - order results , and make the resulting branching ratios in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "although the branching ratio @xmath78 is significantly increased over the lowest - order result , it is still much lower than the experimental result .",
    "the discrepancy probably arises for the same reason that we fail to fit the @xmath79 cross section , namely that the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance does not contribute to this reaction , and that higher - order loop corrections will presumably be necessary to reproduce this branching ratio .",
    "more precise measurements of all of these reactions would be very useful in constraining the parameters of the chiral lagrangians .",
    "we have applied the effective chiral lagrangian to describe low - energy interactions in channels coupled to the @xmath68 system .",
    "our lagrangian includes the terms of leading and next - to - leading order supplemented by a term describing the process of formation and decay of the @xmath3(1405 ) resonance . in our approach the @xmath3(1405 )",
    "state appears as an independent quantum field , on the same footing as any other meson or baryon field included in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the effective low - energy constants were extracted from the available experimental data on the different reactions involving a @xmath68 channel in the initial state .",
    "constraints on the expansion parameters were provided by fitting the isospin - even @xmath39 s - wave scattering length @xmath44 and isospin zero kaon - nucleon s - wave scattering length @xmath45 . the @xmath3(1405 ) provides a dominant effect in practically every reaction channel , with the exception of the @xmath80 process .",
    "we obtained satisfactory agreement between our theoretical calculations and the experimental cross sections .",
    "we also analyzed three threshold branching ratios . in two cases we obtained very good agreement with the data , and inclusion of the second - order contribution significantly improved the calculated branching ratio .",
    "for the branching ratio @xmath78 , although the second - order result was twice as large as the branching ratio obtained in leading order , the theoretical result remained far below experiment .",
    "the loop corrections , which are needed to take into account unitarity and coupled channel effects , might help to correct the theoretical prediction for the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "such calculations , however , are not feasible at present because one has more effective constants ( needed to absorb divergences appearing in the loop integrals ) than can be fixed from experimental data",
    ".    a natural extension of our formalism would be to analyze the processes of photo- and electroproduction of a kaon from a proton .",
    "this extension is clearly parameter free .",
    "experimental data exist for the reactions @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these experimental data would help constrain the known low energy effective constants , and would determine the values of previously unknown constants .",
    "extending the calculations to such reactions might provide enough constraints that we could include loop corrections , which are necessary to make this approach fully consistent .",
