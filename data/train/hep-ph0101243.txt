    "the problem of possible inter-@xmath2 dynamical correlations continues to attract much experimental attention at lep - ii  @xcite .",
    "the importance of these in a precision measurement of the @xmath2-mass  @xcite is by far the main reason for the flurry of present activities .",
    "however , this should not be the sole motivation for careful experimental work in this subfield .",
    "for example , the possible absence of bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) between pions originating from different @xmath2 s raises interesting general and basic questions regarding the coherent versus incoherent nature of particle emission .",
    "also the question of possible color- or string - reconnection effects may be of considerable importance for our understanding of the vacuum properties of quantumchromodynamics .    as repeatedly emphasized by the lund group  @xcite , bose - einstein correlations of a _ coherent _ type ,",
    "for which we suggest the name `` string symmetrization correlations ( ssc ) '' , are present in any string model of hadron production . moreover , the ssc depend essentially only on _ local _ properties of the string and should thus be independent of the environment in which the string is fragmenting .",
    "this basic property is not in contradiction with experimental results on bose - einstein correlations in @xmath1 annihilations and lepton - nucleon scattering .",
    "however , in systems comprising several strings , a _",
    "second type _ of bose - einstein correlations may exist if the different strings behave independently so that they act as incoherent sources of particle emission .",
    "this second - order intensity correlation effect , or hbt effect , since first discovered by hanbury brown and twiss  @xcite , is expected to reflect the `` geometry '' of the collision process and , in particular , to be sensitive to the size of the `` freeze - out '' volume where the hadrons are formed .",
    "this volume could have an extension of many fermi s and can thus be significantly larger than the typical `` radii '' of less than a fermi , commonly measured in bec studies of @xmath1 annihilations . as a result , correlation functions of identical bosons may well show an additional enhancement at substantially smaller values of their momentum difference than for ssc correlations .",
    "the reaction @xmath3 is a prototypical example of a system of which the hadronisation proceeds via the fragmentation of two color - fields or strings . barring possible reconnection effects at an early stage of the evolution of the system",
    ", these strings are thought to fragment independently .",
    "thus , ssc within single @xmath2 s and inter-@xmath2 hbt correlations could coexist in this system , but manifest themselves in different ranges of the commonly used variable @xmath4 , the square of the difference of the four - momenta of the identical pions .",
    "no dedicated searches in this direction have been made so far . moreover ,",
    "if the hbt correlations are of much shorter range than naively expected , the influence on @xmath2-mass measurements is likely to be much weaker than present studies suggest .",
    "limited statistics as well as limited experimental sensitivity at very small @xmath5 may prevent the hbt - type of correlation effect to be clearly observed in @xmath6 events . however , as yet unexplored alternative reactions exist .",
    "much larger statistics is available in @xmath7 events .",
    "for these , due to the emission of a hard gluon , two color - disconnected strings are stretched , one between the quark and the gluon , another between the gluon and the antiquark .",
    "depending on the origin of the identical pions studied , ssc as well as hbt correlations should contribute to the correlations among identical bosons .    in hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    ", hadroproduction is also believed to result from the break - up of several to very many strings .",
    "since the superposition of many independent particle `` sources '' weakens the measured strength of correlations of the ssc type , hbt correlations may well dominate the bose - einstein correlations measured in these processes .",
    "this could also explain the observed positive correlation between particle density ( or multiplicity ) and the measured bec radii . finally ,",
    "due to the `` inside - outside '' character of hadron production , whereby low - momentum particles `` freeze out '' first ( in any reference frame ) , one may expect a correlation between the width of the bose - einstein enhancement and particle momenta if the hbt correlations are the dominant effect .",
    "returning to correlations in the @xmath8 system , experimental study of such effects should start from a well - defined mathematical framework .",
    "since , in general , inter-@xmath2 dynamics introduces genuine correlations between the decay products of the @xmath2 s , we generalize the formalism presented in an earlier paper on the subject  @xcite where observables relevant for the case of stochastic independence and fully overlapping decays of the @xmath2 s were proposed .",
    "we consider the general case of stochastic dependence and the separation of the @xmath2 hadronic decay products in momentum space .",
    "we concentrate on second - order ( two - particle ) inclusive densities and correlation functions but the results can be generalized to higher orders .    in the mathematical treatment of the problem ,",
    "a general inter-@xmath2 correlation function is introduced , representing an arbitrary stochastic correlation between hadrons from different @xmath2 s which could arise from color reconnection effects , bose - einstein correlations or others .",
    "although most of the examples treated in this paper relate to bose - einstein studies involving identical particles , the formalism is general and can be used , where needed with a suitable change of kinematic variables , in other contexts as well .",
    "before discussing the problem of correlations among particles originating from @xmath2 s decaying into fully hadronic , so - called four - jet configurations , @xmath9 , we first consider a more general problem .",
    "assume that a system ( an event ) comprising in total @xmath10 ( observed ) particles , can be subdivided into @xmath11 possibly stochastically correlated groups or `` sources '' @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we take the @xmath10 particles to be of identical type and assume that the groups are mutually exclusive i.e. every particle can be assigned to one and one group only particles in @xmath11 groups according to the underlying dynamics .",
    "it could also be based on an experimentally dictated partition of the phase space in @xmath11 distinct ( non - overlapping ) regions as the result of jet clustering . ] : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "no assumptions are made , however , about possible overlap in momentum space of particles from different groups .",

    "most emphasis was put on two - particle inclusive densities and correlation functions for @xmath63 , but the formalism can be extended to arbitrary orders and arbitrary @xmath11 .      for the observables used in present studies , correlations in fully hadronic @xmath8 decay s can be expressed in terms of the correlation function of a single @xmath2 , an inter-@xmath2 correlation @xmath212 and a function , @xmath213 , which quantifies the degree of overlap in momentum space of the decay products from different @xmath2 s .    on several examples , we have shown that some of the presently used techniques to search for inter-@xmath2 correlations are not optimal . in some cases ,",
    "experimental quantities have been used which lack the correct mathematical properties and are based on intuition rather than on sound mathematics .",
    "the determination of the overlap function allows to assess quantitatively the sensitivity of a particular distribution to inter-@xmath2 correlations .",
    "moreover , the influence of experimental and methodological cuts can be systematically investigated .",
    "an estimate of @xmath142 , presented here , indicates that the fully hadronic , four - jet decay channel of the reaction @xmath214 may not be optimal to search for inter-@xmath2 bose - einstein effects . the usual event selections , requiring four well - isolated jets in the final state , weaken the sensitivity to possible inter-@xmath2 correlations .",
    "better results may well be obtained in analyses using less stringent cuts , or which include three - jet events with suitably chosen topology so as to keep the qcd background at a tolerable level .",
    "our survey of some of the test - distributions used so far indicates that the observable @xmath163 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q : delta ] ) , proposed in  @xcite and measured by l3  @xcite , provides a direct measure of possible inter-@xmath2 correlations .",
    "it suggests itself as suitable observable well - adapted for a global lep - wide combination of @xmath8 data ."
