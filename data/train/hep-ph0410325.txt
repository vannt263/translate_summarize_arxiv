    "in this talk , i would like to use this opportunity to stress one problem that we met in studying the polarization of hadrons produced in high energy reactions .",
    "it is now well - known that , for the spin compositions of nucleon , we have two kinds of results : one is obtained from the su(6 ) wave - function , the other from the polarized deeply inelastic @xmath1 scattering data and other related knowledges .",
    "we denote them by su(6 ) and dis pictures in the following .",
    "i would like to emphasize that both of them can be extended to other baryons in the same flavor su(3 ) octet as the nucleon.[1 ] this is because in obtaining the dis results for nucleon , we have already used the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the results can be found in different literature , e.g. , table 1 of [ 2 ] , which i include also here ( table 1 ) .",
    "we see that these results are very much different from each other .",
    "we have therefore a very practical question : which should we use when we calculate the polarization of hadrons produced in high energy reactions from the polarizations of quarks ?",
    "there exist two classes of theoretical treatments : one of them simply uses su(6 ) , the other uses dis .",
    "but there is no discussion about the question which should be used before [ 2 ] .    in [ 2 ] , we first explicitly pointed out the problem and showed that @xmath4 in @xmath0 annihilation at the @xmath5 pole is an ideal place to study it .",
    "we made the calculations on @xmath4 polarization using the dis picture , compared the results with those from su(6 ) obtained by gustafson and hkkinen earlier [ 3 ] , and the available data from aleph [ 4 ] and later [ 5 ] also those from opal [ 6 ] ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "we found that the data can unfortunately not be able to distinguish between the two pictures although it seems that the su(6 ) results fit the data better .",
    "we therefore made a systematical study [ 2,5,7 ] for different cases in this connection . in the following",
    ", i will briefly summary the results obtained .",
    "they can be used for further tests by future experiments .",
    "similar calculations have also been carried out by other groups [ e.g. 8 - 11 ] .",

    "to test different pictures for spin transfer in the fragmentation process @xmath6 , we need : ( 1 ) to produce a @xmath7 beam with known polarization , ( 2 ) to measure the polarization of @xmath8 . hence",
    ", hyperon polarizations ( @xmath9 ) in the following three cases are best suitable : ( a ) @xmath10 ; ( b ) current fragmentation region in polarized @xmath11 ; ( c ) high @xmath2 jets in polarized @xmath3 collisions .",
    "this is because , here we can ( i ) separate fragmentation from the others , ( ii ) calculate the polarization of the quark before fragmentation , ( iii ) measure the polarizations of hyperons easily .    to calculate @xmath9 in @xmath12",
    ", we divide the produced @xmath13 into the following four groups : ( a ) directly produced and contain the initial @xmath7 ; ( b ) directly produced but do not contain the initial @xmath7 ; ( c ) decay contribution from heavier hyperons @xmath14 that are polarized ; ( d ) decay contribution from @xmath14 that are unpolarized .",
    "that is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fragmentation function .",
    "similarly , for polarized case , we denote , @xmath17 , ( the @xmath18 or @xmath19 means that the produced @xmath13 is polarized in the same or opposite direction as the initial @xmath7 ) , and we have , @xmath20 clearly , there is no contribution for group ( d ) to @xmath21 , and it is assumed [ 2,3 ] that there is no contribution from group ( b ) either .",
    "hence , we have , @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the fragmentation spin transfer factor and is taken as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fractional contribution of spin of quark of flavor @xmath7 to @xmath13 as given in table 1 , @xmath26 is the number of valence quarks of flavor @xmath7 in @xmath13 .",
    "clearly @xmath25 is different in su(6 ) or dis picture .",
    "this is the place where different pictures come in .",
    "@xmath27 is the decay spin transfer factor in @xmath28 .",
    "it is determined by the decay and is independent of the pictures for spin transfer in fragmentation .    here",
    ", i would like to emphasize the following two points .",
    "first , the classification of @xmath13 into the above - mentioned four groups is independent of the polarization .",
    "all the @xmath29 s can be calculated using our knowledge on hadronization in unpolarized case .",
    "in fact , in the feynman - field - type of cascade fragmentation models , ( a ) is just the first rank hadron and the @xmath30-distribution @xmath31 , usually denoted by @xmath32 is a basic input of the model .",
    "practically , all of them can be easily calculated using a monte - carlo event generator .",
    "the results are quite stable .",
    "hence , the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath9 in this model is empirically known without any input in connection with polarization effects .",
    "this is a good point to test the model . in fig.1",
    ", we see that although different pictures lead to different @xmath33 but the @xmath30-dependence is essentially the same , and it is also in agreement with the data .",
    "this is a strong support of the calculation procedure presented above .",
    "second , for decay contribution , presently , we have data on @xmath27 for @xmath34 octet @xmath14 s .",
    "hence there is little uncertainty here .",
    "but for decuplet hyperons , there is neither data for @xmath27 nor @xmath25 in dis picture .",
    "we can only make a rough estimation by invoking the simple quark model for both of them .",
    "there is a strong model dependence , especially for @xmath25 , the estimation is definitely too crude .",
    "hence , to make a good test of different pictures for spin transfer in fragmentation , we should choose the places to avoid the contribution from decuplet hyperon decay .",
    ": results for different hyperons have been obtained [ 2,5 ] .",
    "we would like to have flavor separation in particular for @xmath35 or @xmath36 to @xmath4 .",
    "we found that it is impossible to do it in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath37-pole where @xmath38 dominates .    here",
    ", we have almost automatic flavor separation since @xmath39 dominates the current fragmentation regions , and we have the advantage to study both longitudinally and transversely polarized cases in @xmath40 collisions .",
    "i would like to emphasize the following two points showed by the results : ( 1 ) there is a quite large contribution from heavier hyperon decay to @xmath4 in these reactions and the final result for @xmath33 is small in most cases .",
    "in particular , in @xmath41 , we have a significant contribution from @xmath42 , the spin transfer from which is completely unknown .",
    "hence it is _ not _ a good choice to use @xmath4 in these reactions to test different pictures . in contrast , there is almost no contribution from heavier hyperon decay to @xmath43 and @xmath44 is large .",
    "( 2 ) in the energy region of the presently available experiments such as hermes[12 ] and nomad[13 ] , it is impossible to separate the struck quark fragmentation from the target remnant contribution .",
    "in fact , the target remnant contributions dominate even in the middle of the so - called current fragmentation region in this case [ 7 ] .",
    "it is thus difficult to use these data to test the different pictures .",
    "one has to go to higher energies .    :",
    "here we reached similar conclusions as in ( ii ) , i.e. , the contributions from heavier hyperon decay to @xmath4 is high and it is more suitable to use @xmath45 to test different pictures . for details ,",
    "see [ 7 ] .",
    "besides , we found that spin alignments of vector mesons can also provide useful information in this connection .",
    "data from lep exits , calculations have been made and compared with them .",
    "further predictions for deeply inelastic @xmath1 scattering or @xmath3 collisions have been made .",
