    "<S> the @xmath2@xmath3 model description of a _ single _ orbiton eqs . ( [ eq : spectraltj]-[eq : tj ] ) is general and valid for any dimension : the mapping rests entirely on the fact that spin on the excited orbital is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the jordan - wigner fermionization applied to the 2d case gives the @xmath2@xmath3 model expressed in terms of jordan - wigner fermions  @xcite and consequently the 2d version of eqs . </S>",

    "<S> a very good approximate solution for the higher - dimensional @xmath2@xmath3 model with @xmath72 can be obtained by perturbation theory , because @xmath72 corresponds to weak coupling , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solution shows that in 2d or 3d a single orbiton in the undoped af system described by the @xmath2@xmath3 model can not fractionalize due the magnetic string effect . </S>",
    "<S> still , the orbiton dressed with spin fluctuations is mobile on a renormalized scale  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example the 2d case directly corresponds to the result in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which gives @xmath79 for the orbiton dispersion ( @xmath80 are positive parameters @xmath81 when @xmath82 , cf . ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for exact values ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus expect to observe , e.g. in high resolution rixs experiment on 2d cuprates , a spectrum similar to the one - particle greens function of the higher - dimensional @xmath2@xmath3 model , with a low - energy quasi - particle orbiton peak @xmath83 and additional incoherent part  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , while the parameters @xmath80 depend on @xmath84 and would vary in more realistic spin - orbital models @xcite , the general shape of the orbiton dispersion @xmath85  the minimum at @xmath86 , saddle point at @xmath87 , maxima at @xmath88 and @xmath89  is robust reflecting the fact that the coherent motion of orbiton is possible only within a given spin - sublattice </S>",
    "<S> .    _ no analogue in spin sector. _ let us now revisit the analogue where the spin is polarized ( fm ) and the orbital sector shows ao order due to , e.g. , a large jahn - teller effect . an example would be the fm and ao planes in lamno@xmath41 or kcuf@xmath41  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many studies have shown that the orbital degrees of freedom merely renormalize the spin excitation in this case and do not change the periodicity of magnons ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative difference is caused by the fact that in realistic cases the jahn - teller stabilized ao order is much more classical and robust , thus suppressing the creation of orbital excitations by the excited spin and giving larger weight to the pure spin excitation . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , spin waves are typically below the orbital gap and well protected by the underlying @xmath1 symmetry and goldstone theorem .    in conclusion , we have shown that orbitons in realistic spin - orbital models with af - spin and ferroorbital ground state are so strongly coupled to the spin excitations that the usual mean - field decoupling of two sectors breaks down . in fact , we have presented an exact mapping of the problem onto an effective @xmath2@xmath3 model and have shown that the orbiton in such models behaves like a single hole in undoped af mott insulator . however , since the typical superexchange parameters for kk spin - orbital models lead to @xmath72 , the study of orbiton problem provides access to a regime of the @xmath2@xmath3 model which has been thought to be ` unphysical ' in terms of single - band hubbard models . </S>",
