    "the presence of dust in galaxies represents one of the major obstacles complicating a direct quantification of the star formation activity in local and high redshift galaxies .",
    "absorption by dust grains reddens the spectra at short wavelengths and modifies altogether the spectral energy distribution of galaxies .",
    "since the uv radiation is emitted by young stars ( @xmath4 yr ) that are generally more affected by attenuation from surrounding dust clouds than older stellar populations , rest - frame uv observations can lead to incomplete and/or biased reconstructions of the star formation activity and star formation history of galaxies affected by dust absorption , unless proper corrections are applied .",
    "+ in recent years our understanding of dust attenuation received a tremendous impulse from studies of local starburst galaxies ( i.e.@xcite ) , that were based on three indicators : the ratio of the total infrared to far - ultraviolet emission ( @xmath3 ) , the ultraviolet spectral slope @xmath0 ( determined from a power - law fit of the form @xmath5 to the uv continuum spectrum in the range 1300 and 2600 @xmath6 , @xcite ) and the balmer decrement .",
    "the total - ir ( tir ) to uv luminosity ratio method ( i.e. @xcite ) is based on the assumption that a fraction of photons emitted by stars and gas are absorbed by the dust .",
    "the dust heats up and subsequently re - emits the energy in the mid- and far - infrared .",
    "the amount of uv attenuation can thus be quantified by means of an energy balance .",
    "this method is considered the most reliable estimator of the dust attenuation in star - forming galaxies because it is almost completely independent of the assumed extinction mechanisms ( i.e. dust / star geometry , extinction law , see @xcite ) .",
    "when the spectrum is dominated by a young stellar population the ultraviolet spectral slope @xmath0 , is found to have a weak dependence on metallicity , imf , and star formation history @xcite .",
    "thus the difference between the observed @xmath0 and the one predicted by models can be entirely ascribed to dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "however in systems with no or mild star formation activity the uv spectral slope can be strongly contaminated by the old stellar populations , whose contribution increases @xmath0 ( flattens the uv continuum , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the spectral slope of mildly star forming systems could be intrinsically different from the one of starburst galaxies , even in the absence of dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite have shown that in starburst galaxies the total far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosity ratio correlates with the ultraviolet spectral slope , @xmath0 ( commonly referred to as the irx - uv relation ) .",
    "they pointed out that this relation allows reliable estimates of the attenuation by dust at ultraviolet wavelengths based on @xmath0 . +",
    "the balmer decrement gives an estimate of the attenuation of ionized gas and not of the stellar continuum as in the previous two methods .",
    "it is based on the comparison of the observed h@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio with its predicted value ( 2.86 for case b recombination , assuming an electronic density @xmath7 and temperature @xmath8 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found a significant correlation between the ultraviolet spectral slope @xmath0 and the balmer decrement h@xmath2/h@xmath0 .",
    "starting from this empirical relation they obtained an attenuation law ( known as the calzetti attenuation law ) often adopted to correct uv observations for dust attenuation in absence of both far - infrared observations and estimates of the ultraviolet spectral slope @xcite . + unfortunately the above empirical relations have been established only for starburst galaxies and they seem not to hold for normal star forming galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that quiescent galaxies deviate from the irx - uv relation of starburst galaxies , because they tend to have redder ultraviolet spectra at fixed total far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosity ratio .",
    "@xcite confirmed this result and interpreted the different behaviour of starbursts and normal galaxies as due to a difference in the star formation histories .",
    "they proposed that the offset from the starburst irx - uv relation can be predicted using the birthrate parameter @xmath9 ( e.g. the ratio of the current to the mean past star formation activity ) .",
    "however an independent observational confirmation of the correlation between the distance from the starburst irx - uv relation and the birthrate parameter has not been obtained so far ( @xcite ) .",
    "even the calzetti law does not seem to be universal .",
    "@xcite showed that for normal star forming galaxies the attenuation derived from the calzetti law is @xmath100.6 mag larger than the one computed from the @xmath11 ratio and their result has been recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "+ why do normal star - forming galaxies behave differently from starbursts ? do normal galaxies follow different empirical relations that can be exploited to correct for dust attenuation in absence of far infrared observations ? if this is the case , is there a transition between starburst and normal galaxies ? which physical parameters drive it ? answering these questions will be important for a better understanding of the interaction of dust and radiation specifically in nearby dusty star forming galaxies , but it also has direct consequences for our understanding and interpretation of galaxy evolution in a general context .",
    "firstly it seems mandatory to characterize the dust attenuation properties of normal galaxies , to compare them with the ones of starbursts and to derive new recipes for the uv dust attenuation correction .",
    "this topic came once again to the fore with the launch of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) .",
    "this satellite is delivering to the community an unprecedented amount of uv data on local and high redshift galaxies that require corrections for dust attenuation but currently lack far - infrared rest - frame data .",
    "the time is ripe to explore new methods for correction of these data , that might provide new insights on galaxy evolution . whenever they can be combined with other data , galex observations",
    "provide the best available ultraviolet data for studying the dust attenuation properties of galaxies .",
    "multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations are in fact mandatory in order to : determine metallicity , ionized gas attenuation ( @xmath12 ) ) , luminosity and mass , test the validity of the relations followed by starbursts @xcite , explore relations that might prove useful to correct ultraviolet magnitudes and to compare them with various models of dust attenuation .",
    "recent extensive spectroscopic and photometric surveys , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df , @xcite ) have opened the path to studies of fundamental physical parameters based on enormous datasets .",
    "however , spectroscopic observations of nearby galaxies suffer from strong aperture effects , making these datasets not ideal for the purpose of the present investigation .",
    "in fact , @xcite have recently shown that aperture effects produce both systematic and random errors on the estimate of star - formation , metallicity and attenuation . to reduce at least the systematic effects they suggest selecting only samples with fibres that capture @xmath13 20% of the light .",
    "this requires @xmath14 and @xmath15 for sdss and 2df respectively : too distant to detect both giant and dwarf star forming systems with galex and iras .",
    "+ although significantly smaller than the sdss , the dataset we have been building up over the last 10 years with data taken over a large stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum for few thousand galaxies in the local universe ( worldwide available from the site goldmine ; @xcite ) turns out to be appropriate for the purposes of the present investigation .",
    "it includes drift - scan mode integrated spectra , narrow band h@xmath2 and broad band optical and near - infrared imaging for a volume limited sample of nearby galaxies in and outside rich clusters .",
    "the combination of galex and iras observations with these ancillary data allows us to study the dust attenuation properties in a sizable sample of normal star forming galaxies not suffering from the aperture bias and to compare observations with model predictions .    in this first paper",
    "we investigate the relations between dust attenuation and global galaxy properties and compare them with the ones observed in starburst galaxies .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide some empirical relations based on observable quantities ( thus model independent ) suitable for deriving dust attenuation corrections when far infrared data are not available .",
    "for this reason all relations obtained throughout this paper will be given as a function of @xmath3 , the observable that we consider the best dust attenuation indicator .",
    "we choose not to transform @xmath3 into a ( model dependent ) estimate of the far ultraviolet extinction @xmath16 , leaving the reader free to choose his / her preferred dust model ( i.e. @xcite , inoue et al . in preparation ) . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that quantities are related linearly and residual plots are presented in order to test the validity of this hypothesis .",
    "moreover , since we are looking for new recipies to estimate the @xmath3 ratio , this quantity has to be considered as the dependent variable , implying the use of an unweighted simple linear fit to estimate the best fitting parameters @xcite . +",
    "a forthcoming paper will be focused on the comparison between models and observations hoping to gain a better understanding on the physics of dust attenuation and to study new recipes useful to convert @xmath3 into @xmath16 .",
