    "the study of stellar - forming regions ( sfr ) and young clusters is key for a complete understanding of cloud collapse and for evaluating star - formation mechanisms .",
    "one of the main aims is the search for patterns in the phase - space ( in the classical dynamical sense of the term ) and its subsequent temporal evolution .",
    "the spatial part of the phase space has been widely studied through a variety of studies and statistical tools ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "however , only a few clusters have been studied considering kinematic data as well @xcite , and all of them used customized exploratory hand - made analyses .",
    "this lack of knowledge of the structure associated with the kinematic dimensions of the phase - space is due both to the scarcity of accurate and complete kinematic data and also to the absence of reliable statistical tools specifically designed for this purpose .    in our previous work , @xcite",
    ", we addressed this issue and presented a statistical tool to analyse the kinematic structure of a dataset , which we call spectrum of kinematic groupings or skg .",
    "we showed the capabilities of this tool for distinguishing structure associated with radial velocity ( rv ) using a set of test cases with a wide range of configurations .",
    "the skg can be easily implemented in any pipeline developed to mine large databases and leads to a quantitative description of the kinematic pattern allowing a comparative analysis between different clusters , environments and datasets in a homogeneous way .",
    "this makes the skg a suitable procedure for analysing the amount of data expected either from ground - based projects such as apogee @xcite , lamost @xcite , ges @xcite , and weave @xcite , or from the gaia space mission @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will show the potential of this method for analysing a set of real data from the star - forming region ngc   2264 .",
    "we have chosen this area for two main reasons : first of all , it is a particularly interesting region of the sky where the existence of a spatial pattern of rv has previously been detected @xcite , and at the same time it is one of the regions with most active star formation , containing ob stars , pms stars , ionized , neutral and molecular gas interacting in the complex process of forming stars .",
    "ngc   2264 is a very interesting region , located in the monoceros ob1 association , in the third galactic quadrant .",
    "this is one of the least obscured regions in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "its line of sight may be crossing different galactic features , such as the local arm , the perseus arm , the outer arm and the monoceros ring .",
    "ngc   2264 is relatively near , at a distance between 750 and 900 pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered for the first time a well - populated sequence of pre - main - sequence stars in this region , in accordance with the young age of its members , between 1 and 6 myr @xcite and other hints indicating that star formation has occurred in different regions of the molecular cloud over the last several myr @xcite .",
    "the large amount of molecular gas remaining in the various cloud cores indicates that star formation may continue in the region for several myr . despite the gas , ngc",
    "2264 shows low reddening @xcite , which makes the study of its members easier .",
    "based on optical photometric data of the region , @xcite identified two dense sfrs ( s mon and cone in the northern and southern parts of the area , respectively ) , and a low density halo surrounding them . later work by @xcite further refined the cone sfr , finding two substructures , the spokes cluster and the cone core .",
    "all these reasons have made ngc   2264 a traditional laboratory for studying star formation , and there is a long list of works on this object , focusing on different topics , such as the properties of the gas @xcite , stellar content @xcite , and their interaction and feedback in the cluster region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in this work we will focus on the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite , which showed a well - structured spatial pattern associated with the radial velocity ( rv ) .",
    "@xcite performed a careful and individualized analysis of the data , finding a north - south gradient in rv and spatial substructure associated with rv consistent with the structure of the molecular gas in the region .",
    "@xcite expanded the sample from @xcite to perform a new analysis , and found a new population of stars , in this case systematically blueshifted from the molecular gas .",
    "we will use the complete sample from @xcite to check the quality of the results obtained with the skg , comparing them with the results from their careful , individualized analysis .",
    "the paper is divided into four sections , the first being this introduction .",
    "the description of the procedure is shown in section 2 , and its application to the star - forming region ngc   2264 and the main conclusions of the study are presented in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the search for phase - space structure in stellar systems requires specific tools that respond to different concepts of what a stellar grouping is .",
    "here we consider the existence of a clumpy velocity pattern where there are velocity ranges ( channels ) whose spatial distribution is more concentrated than that of the whole kinematic interval . in this section",
    "we briefly describe the method , but refer to @xcite for a thorough description of the foundation and procedure .",
    "the essence of the method is to examine a group of stars associated with a radial velocity channel , and calculate its _ kinematic index _",
    "@xmath0 , which compares its concentration with that of a group of the same size , representative of the whole sample . to measure the concentration of a group of stars",
    "we will use the median edge length of its euclidean minimum spanning tree ( henceforth mst ) .",
    "the procedure designed to search for kinematic segregation starts from a sample of stars in a region of the sky , including both potential cluster members and field stars , preferably with accurate spatial coordinates and precise radial velocity data .",
    "first we sort the data by radial velocity values and separate the sample into bins of size @xmath1 with an incremental step @xmath2 , so we scan the whole rv domain .",
    "we then obtain the mst of each bin and calculate its median edge length .",
    "we also calculate the median edge length of the mst of 500 groups of size @xmath1 randomly extracted from the whole sample , and consider the mean of the 500 medians as the size of a group of @xmath1 elements representative of the whole sample .",
    "we estimate the kinematic index associated with each velocity channel , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 the median edge length of the mst of the bin @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the mean of the median edge length of the 500 stochastic groups of size @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath9 then the bin @xmath7 is more concentrated than the representative group .",
    "a plot of @xmath10 against the median of the radial velocity @xmath11 in the @xmath3 interval for all j , constitutes the _ spectrum of kinematic groupings , or skg , _ which provides an interesting and useful tool for the exploratory analysis of the stellar - system phase space .",
    "those @xmath10 that verify the inequality @xmath12 mark the radial velocity channels @xmath3 where kinematic structure or segregation has been detected .",
    ". [ eq3 ] is a conservative criterion where @xmath10 is larger than unity with confidence level greater than 95% .    after applying this method",
    ", we get eight variables associated with each rv bin : four of them correspond to its location in the cluster and its spatial extent ; another two are the radial velocity median and dispersion ; and the last two are the kinematic index and its uncertainty .",
    "we now apply the method described in the previous section to the case of ngc   2264 .",
    "our sample consists of the ( ra , dec , rv ) data from @xcite , downloaded from the vizier catalogue @xcite , for 995 stars ( of which 407 are very likely members according to the authors ) in the field of ngc   2264 with a very broad range of rv .",
    "the stars are mainly distributed along a north - south strip with two apparent concentrations or lobes , consistent with the structure described in @xcite .",
    "the s mon sfr would correspond to the northern lobe and the cone sfr to the southern .",
    "there is also a medium density structure in the central western area of the region .",
    "the first step was changing the coordinates to angular distances , @xmath13ra and @xmath13dec , to a centroid of the area , in this case the average position in ( ra , dec)=(100.189 , 9.691 ) .",
    "this was done so the position coordinates used are more coherent with the euclidean distances we use in the mst calculations .",
    "we started by feeding our algorithm with all the spatial and rv data of all the stars independently of the rv measurement quality or membership probability , to check the performance of the method in a realistic situation of contaminated , possibly biased samples with error .",
    "in addition , we set the bin size to @xmath14 , the nearest integer to the square root of the number of stars to analyse , and step @xmath15 , as would be done in an automatic pipeline implementation .",
    ".characteristics of selected groups a and b , and the separated components of a : a1 , a2 , and a3 . from left to right : number of stars , mean radial velocity , median radial velocity and velocity dispersion [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabla3 ]",
    "* with the skg we can visualize , at a glance , the kinematic behaviour of the population in a stellar system .",
    "the algorithm is easy to implement in any pipeline aimed at analysing the phase space of stellar systems and has been specially designed for the study of large amounts of quality data , such as those expected from the gaia mission .",
    "although in this paper we have focused on the analysis of the radial velocity , the method can be easily extrapolated to other velocity components , such as the proper motions . * the application of the skg method to the star - forming region ngc   2264 enabled us to highlight the excellent capabilities of the method for analysing the phase - space structure of a real dataset of stars .",
    "moreover , the iterated hierarchical application of the algorithm shows the kinematic structure at different scales .",
    "* when we automatically calculate the skg of the raw data we find two large significant structures ( groups a and b ) with very different distributions both in space and rv .",
    "group a is clearly associated with the central positions and radial velocities of ngc   2264 and shows hints of internal substructure , and group b is associated with large radial velocities and spread towards the outskirts of the spatial domain .",
    "the appearance of substructure in the outer area was an unexpected result from our method . *",
    "the skg allows us to distinguish structure associated with kinematic populations in star - forming regions . depending on the scale of the sample",
    ", we can find structure associated with stellar clusters , substructure in stellar clusters or even structure in field - related velocity channels .",
    "* when we hierarchically iterate the analysis and study the members of group a we find at least four different subgroups separated in radial velocity , consistent with the complex kinematic structure manually found by previous works @xcite , which also found dynamical coupling of some of the structures with the surrounding gas .",
    "the results obtained by our analysis are also selfconsistent . *",
    "the structures found in the northern and southern lobes of ngc   2264 can be associated with older and younger regions , respectively , found by @xcite .",
    "these resulst suggest that the kinematic structure of the phase space can be used to trace the particularities of star formation in a specific region . *",
    "the members of group b are in the red - giant locus of the nir colour - colour diagram of the whole sample",
    ". this may hint at b group members being giants far away in the background of ngc   2264 .",
    "we have roughly estimated the distance to these stars with two different methods and obtained a median kinematic distance of 6.4 kpc and a median photometric distance of 7.0 kpc , both with large uncertainty .",
    "these rough distance estimates and the rv values are compatible with distant structures such as the outer arm or the monoceros ring , but we can not distinguish between them with our current data .",
    "* in an area as complex as this one , the spatial structure associated with radial velocity found with our method could be roughly associated with the tridimensional structure of the galactic disk . in this case",
    ", the skg would work as a raw tomography of the galactic structure in the direction of the line of sight .",
    "* the structure associated with the phase - space can be used to discover populations associated with other variables not included in the analysed dataset , such as age or distance , given the intimate relationship it has with star - formation processes and the dynamical evolution of clustered stars .",
