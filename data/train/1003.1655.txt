    "in the last decade , the single - user ( point - to - point ) information - hiding ( information - embedding , watermarking ) model has been thoroughly studied from an information - theoretic point of view ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . with the rapid development of wired and wireless communication networks , situations arise where privacy protection is no longer a point - to - point problem . therefore , it is of interest to study information - hiding problems in multi - user settings .    in this paper",
    "we consider the scenario in which two secret messages ( watermarks ) are independently embedded in two correlated sources ( covertexts ) and are then jointly decoded under multiple - access attacks .",
    "this scenario is motivated by , for example , the practical situation where audio and video frames are watermarked separately , but they are transmitted in a single bit stream and decoded by one multimedia player ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ model ] and it assumes that two users separately embed their watermarks @xmath0 and @xmath1 into two correlated discrete memoryless sources ( dmss ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "each user can only access one of the two covertexts .",
    "the watermarked messages ( stegotexts ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 are then sent through a multiple - access attack channel ( maac ) to a decoder which attempts to reconstruct the watermarks .",
    "for this two - user information embedding system we are interested in determining the embedding capacity region ; i.e. , the two - dimensional set of all achievable embedding rate pairs under constraints on the embedding distortions .

    "the markov encoders can be briefly described as follows .",
    "one of the encoders ( embedders ) , say encoder 1 , first forms an estimate of the source sequence of the other encoder , and then generates @xmath10 which is jointly typical with the observed source sequence @xmath7 and the estimated source sequence .",
    "the other encoder , encoder 2 , first forms an estimate of the source sequence as well as the auxiliary codeword of encoder 1 , and then generates @xmath11 which is jointly typical with the source sequence @xmath6 and all the other sequences estimated . for the resulting scheme ,",
    "an extended markov lemma ( lemma [ lemma_emk ] ) ensures that the auxiliary codewords @xmath10 and @xmath11 , although generated by separate encoders , are jointly typical with the source sequences with a high probability .",
    "we also derive an outer bound for the embedding capacity region with single - letter characterization ( theorem [ theo2 ] ) , using fano s inequality and a standard information - theoretical bounding argument .",
    "we specialize the embedding capacity region to independent covertexts and obtain inner and outer bounds for this case ( theorem [ theo3 ] ) .",
    "the inner bound is a consequence of theorem [ theo1 ] , while in the converse part we sharpen the bound of theorem [ theo2 ] by making use of the independence condition .",
    "we note that the multi - user information embedding problem studied in this paper is related to the works @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present an achievable embedding region for correlated gaussian covertexts and parallel ( independent ) additive gaussian attack channels ( as opposed to the maac considered here ) . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the same system as ours and give an inner bound for the capacity region without a proof , stating that this inner bound can be easily proved via the coding procedure in @xcite .",
    "however , the proof in @xcite seems to be incorrect because the encoders can not guarantee the typicality of the output sequences with respect to the covertexts sequences .",
    "our code construction corrects this problem and in theorem [ theo1 ] we show that the main result in @xcite ( the achievable region ) and the inner bound given in @xcite are both correct .",
    "we also point out that a similar setup concerning a multi - user reversible information embedding system was considered in @xcite and @xcite for two covertexts and a maac .",
    "since in the reversible information embedding problem the secret messages and the covertexts are both reconstructed at the decoder , gelfand and pinsker coding is not required and the coding strategy is fundamentally different from ours .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we set up the public multi - user embedding ( watermarking ) problem , define the embedding capacity region , and present our main results in section [ mainresults ] .",
