    "the peculiar of?p stars have been studied in detail in the optical part of the spectrum , with observations spanning several decades for hd  108 and hd  191612 ( e.g. , walborn 1973 ; naz et al .",
    "large - amplitude variability of optical features ( e.g. , of h@xmath0 and he i lines ) is found to be common for this spectral class ( naz , vreux & rauw 2001 ; howarth et al .",
    "2007 ) , and is characterized by ` high ' and ` low ' ( or maximum / minimum ) states in the degree of emission .",
    "this behaviour is now understood in the context of a magnetic oblique rotator model , wherein the observer s view of a magnetically constrained stellar - wind outflow is modulated by stellar rotation ( see donati et al .",
    "2006 ; wade et al .",
    "2011 ; sundqvist et al .",
    "2012 ) .    despite advances in understanding the nature of of?p stars ,",
    "the behavior of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra at different optical states remains poorly known .",
    "such information is crucially important , since this spectral region contains the most sensitive diagnostics of hot - star winds .",
    "we therefore lack , so far , a complete view of the stellar - wind confinement phenomenon ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) in these stars . a first effort to address this problem",
    "was recently reported by our group for the very slow rotator hd  108 ( marcolino et al . 2012 ; hereinafter paper  i ) .",
    "new observations in the ultraviolet were acquired close to the optical minimum state ; the uv spectrum did show changes compared to international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) observations acquired during a high state , but the variability was not as dramatic as observed in the optical .",
    "marcolino et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that the stellar wind of hd  108 is not severely affected by the magnetic field on a global scale ( i.e. , at large radii ; see paper  i for details ) .",
    "however , because of the long rotational period of hd  108 ( probably about 55 years ; naz , vreux & rauw 2001 ; naz et al .",
    "2010 ) , we still lacked information about uv line profiles at various rotational phases . thus , until now , we have not had a detailed knowledge of uv variability matching that in the optical , for any of?p star .",
    "in this paper we present high - resolution uv spectroscopy of hd  191612d ( howarth et al .",
    "( @xmath2  d ; howarth et al .",
    "2007 ) , which represents the first phase - resolved uv spectra of an of?p star covering the entire rotational cycle .",
    "the observations are described in section  [ obs ] , where we also summarize the variability observed in the main photospheric and wind features and compare the results with our previous findings for hd  108 .",
    "we demonstrate that the strengths of the main uv wind lines , h@xmath0 , and longitudinal magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) , vary coherently according to the rotational period , thereby providing support for an origin linked to the magnetic oblique rotator model .",
    "the stellar and wind parameters of hd  191612 are then revised and discussed based on uv modelling using non - lte expanding - atmosphere models ( section  [ models ] ) . the peculiar variability revealed by the new _ stis _",
    "data is not reproduced by 1d models , but can be explained qualitatively by using magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations of a magnetically confined wind ( section [ mhd ] ) .",
    "section  [ concs ] summarizes the main results of our work and discuss their consequences for the of?p class as a whole .",
    "we used the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ stis _ ) on board _ hst _ to obtain ultraviolet spectra of hd 191612 ( pi .",
    "bouret ; program i d 12179 ) .",
    "table [ obsdetails ] provides a log of the observations , which were obtained at four phases separated by a quarter of the star s",
    "537.6d rotational cycle . at each phase , the observations consisted of two pairs of exposures through the small ( @xmath4 ) aperture , first with the e140 m echelle grating and then with the e230 m echelle grating .",
    "observations with the e140 m grating were centered at 1425   and recorded by the fuv mama detector , while observations with the e230 m grating were centered at 2707   and recorded by the nuv mama detector .",
    "the total wavelength coverage is @xmath51150 ",
    "1750   ( e140 m ) and @xmath52250  3100   ( e230 m ) , with resolving powers r = 45,800 and 30,000 , respectively .",
    "the modified julian dates ( mjd ) of the mid - exposures are listed in table [ obsdetails ] , along with the total integration time ( divided equally between the two exposures ) .",
    "since the two exposures obtained with each configuration were combined , the mid - point of the sequence was used to calculate the phase @xmath6 according to the ephemeris published by howarth et al .",
    "due to the very long stellar variability period , the nuv / fuv exposure pairs correspond to essentially identical phases ( to within a few 10@xmath7 cycles ) .      in figure",
    "[ uv ] we present the spectra of hd  191612 obtained at different rotational phases . in this section",

    ", we estimate the luminosity from a fit to the fuv and nuv spectra plus ubvjhk magnitudes available in the galactic o - star catalog ( sota et al .",
    "the results are included in table  [ params ] , and the fit displayed in fig .",
    "the differential extinction @xmath12 was estimated from the observed @xmath13 and the typical intrinsic value for o6o8 stars , @xmath14 ( martins & plez 2006 ) .",
    "we note that hd  191612 is known to be photometrically variable , but the amplitude is too small to affect these results significantly ; e.g. , the @xmath15 magnitude varies by not more than @xmath50.05 .",
    "we also neglect the contribution of the @xmath5early - b secondary .",
    "such a star is much cooler ( @xmath520kk ) and fainter than the primary and is expected to contribute only about 10 per cent in the visible , and considerably less at uv wavelengths ( see howarth et al .",
    "2007 ) .      from fig .",
    "[ uvfit ] we see that the agreement between our atmosphere model and the _ stis _ data of hd  191612 at phase @xmath16 is reasonable .",
    "we predict p cygni profiles for n@xmath8v  @xmath91240 and c@xmath8iv  @xmath91550 , a good fit for the iron forest , and absorption / incipient p cygni profiles to si@xmath8iv  @xmath91400 and n@xmath8iv  @xmath91718 , as observed .",
    "however , it is evident that some features could not be reproduced in detail .",
    "for example , the synthetic n@xmath8iv  @xmath91718 profile lacks blueshifted absorption . by increasing the n / h ratio to @xmath17",
    "we improve the fit to the observed profile , but this value is much higher than that reported by martins et al . ( 2012 ) , even considering the uncertainties in the determination .",
    "we have also tried several ways to improve the fit to the si@xmath8iv  @xmath91400 feature ( see fig .",
    "[ uvfit ] ) , although a comparison is handicapped by interstellar absorption .",
    "some discrepancies were already expected in our analysis , since we used spherically symmetric atmosphere models .",
    "as discussed previously , lines formed closer to the alfvn radius may be significantly affected by non - sphericity .",
    "ideally , mhd wind - confinement simulations coupled with detailed 3d radiative - transfer calculations should be used to derive the stellar and wind properties of hd  191612 .",
    "however , given the complexity of such a task , the calculation of a full uv and optical theoretical spectrum  as is done by 1d models  is not currently feasible .",
    "instead , in the next section we attempt to provide a physical interpretation for generic uv profiles based on mhd simulations .",
    "this section reports initial results from ongoing attempts to use radiation mhd wind simulations ( developed first by ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) to analyze the strengths and variability of uv resonance lines in magnetic massive stars . to this end",
    ", we apply the same mhd simulation used previously to model the rotational phase variation of hd191612 s h@xmath0 line ( sundqvist et al .",
    "2012 ) , however modifying the radiative transfer code developed there to synthesize uv scattering lines ( following the ` 3-d sei ' method , e.g. cranmer & owocki 1996 ) .",
    "[ fig : mag_uv ] shows generic synthetic profiles for a weak ( upper panel ) and moderately strong ( lower panel ) line , calculated i ) from the mhd model for an observer viewing from above the magnetic pole ( `` high state '' ) and equator ( `` low state '' ) , and ii ) from the spherically symmetric wind model used as initial condition to the mhd simulation .",
    "note how the phase trends of the modeled absorption - strengths indeed display opposite behaviour for the weak and strong lines , as observed for the ( weaker ) si@xmath8iv and ( stronger ) c@xmath8iv lines in hd191612 ( see fig .",
    "[ uv ] ) .",
    "this anti - correlated variability of strong and weak lines can be qualitatively understood as follows : the line - of - sight absorption column in the low state samples the low - velocity , high density wind material trapped by closed field lines near the magnetic equator in hd191612 s _ dynamical magnetosphere _",
    "( sundqvist et al . 2012 ) .",
    "by contrast , the absorption column in the high state covers a wider range of velocities and densities , since it stems from the open field lines streaming from the magnetic pole , and so more closely resembles a ` normal ' wind outflow .",
    "the result is that a _ strong _ line , which has sufficient optical depth to produce measurable absorption at high velocities , is stronger in the _ high state _ ( lower panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a _ weak _ line , which is not able to produce significant absorption at high velocities , is stronger in the _ low state _ ( upper panel ) , because during that phase the line can absorb from the high density , low velocity material trapped in the wind s dynamical magnetosphere .",
    "this figure also shows that profiles computed for intrinsically strong lines ( e.g. , those corresponding to the line strength parameter @xmath18 in fig .  [",
    "fig : mag_uv ] ) are systematically weaker than their counterparts computed from spherically symmetric models , particularly at high velocities .",
    "this effect can be understood by considering the faster - than - radial expansion of a radial polar flow - tube in a magnetic wind ( kopp & holzer 1976 ; owocki & ud - doula 2004 ) , which leads to a different density profile as function of velocity than in a spherical wind",
    ". following owocki & ud - doula ( 2004 ) , let us parameterize the non - radial expansion factor of an areal element , @xmath19 :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the scaled radius and @xmath22 is the magnetic wind confinement parameter applicable to a dipolar field ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) . note how @xmath23 starts off at unity , but increases with radius reaching the asymptotic value @xmath24 . by the equation of continuity @xmath25 ; consequently , for equal basal mass fluxes , the density @xmath26 of a non - magnetic wind will be higher at a specified velocity in the outer wind than the density @xmath27 of a magnetic one , by a factor @xmath28 . since @xmath29 for hd191612 , @xmath30 .",
    "this effect may partly explain the low mass - loss rate inferred from cmfgen models ( sect .",
    "[ models ] ; dilution effect neglected ) compared to the rate needed in the mhd simulations to reproduce hd  191612 s observed h@xmath0 emission strength and variability",
    "( @xmath31 m@xmath32 yr@xmath33 ) .",
    "note also from fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_uv ] that the mhd simulation further predicts a significant increase in wind terminal speed , here by @xmath34 .",
    "however , this does not seem to be observed for hd191612 , whose @xmath35 is not much higher than typical values inferred for non - magnetic o - stars .",
    "a detailed study of the formation of uv wind lines in magnetic massive stars , focusing on issues like those discussed here , will be reported separately ( sundqvist & ud - doula , in prep . ) .",
    "we have presented for the first time phase - resolved uv data for an of?p star , hd  191612 .",
    "our main findings and conclusions are outlined below .    *",
    "the spectra observed at different rotational phases are broadly similar , with the same set of wind and photospheric lines consistently present . however , line profile variations are very significant compared to the ones found in _",
    "normal _ o stars .",
    "* the variability observed is not as drastic as that reported for h@xmath0 and the he i lines in the optical part of the spectrum .",
    "we interpret this result as indicative of the stronger influence of the magnetic field on the lines formed closer to the photosphere ( i.e. , inside the alfvn radius ) , where we find confined material .",
    "* we observe more wind absorption in n@xmath8v  @xmath91240 and c@xmath8iv  @xmath91550 and a less intense iron - forest spectrum at @xmath16 compared to @xmath36 .",
    "the former phase corresponds approximately to the configuration where the magnetic pole is towards the observer while the latter corresponds to the line of sight lying in the plane of the magnetic equator .",
    "such variability is very similar to that reported for hd  108 in paper  i , and could be considered as probably representative of of?p stars .",
    "there are , however , notable differences between hd  108 and hd  191612 , such as the absence of saturated p cygni profiles in hd  191612 and the anti - correlated variability of si@xmath8iv  @xmath91400 and other wind lines .",
    "* cmfgen models are capable of providing a reasonable fit to the uv spectrum of hd  191612 at phase @xmath16 .",
    "the wind and photospheric lines are correctly predicted in broad terms , but not all profiles are reproduced in detail .",
    "furthermore , spherically symmetric models can not reproduce the variability revealed by the _ stis _ data , since these variations arise from the dynamical magnetosphere of hd  191612 .",
    "* we use mhd simulations in combination with simplified radiative transfer calculations to analyse the new _ stis _ phase resolved data of hd  191612 .",
    "we compare generic uv profiles representing c@xmath8iv  @xmath91550 and si@xmath8iv  @xmath91400 .",
    "the observed behaviour at phases @xmath37 and @xmath36 are qualitatively reproduced for both lines ; an explanation for the anti - correlated variability ( figs . [ uv ] and [ pharesdata ] )",
    "is provided in terms of line strengths .",
    "* the mass - loss rate derived for hd  191612 from non - lte expanding atmosphere models for the uv is considerably lower than the one inferred from the mhd simulations ( based on h@xmath0 ; @xmath31 m@xmath32 yr@xmath33 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be partially understood by a density dilution effect ( sect .",
    "[ mhd ] ) but deserves a deeper investigation .",
    "the present results take us a further step towards a detailed picture of the optical and uv variability in of?p stars . in general ,",
    "the optical spectra are strongly affected by the magnetic field , with line formation at or below the alfvn radius .",
    "the uv p cygni profiles present moderate changes , suggesting spherical symmetry may be a reasonable first approximation for the wind at large radii .",
    "mhd simulations such as the ones computed here are however mandatory to describe the ( phase - resolved ) uv profiles in detail .    two additional of?p stars have been recently detected to be magnetic , namely , ngc 1624 - 2 and cpd -28 2561 ( walborn et al .",
    "2010 ; wade et al .",
    "2012 ; hubrig et al .",
    "the basic results regarding the ultraviolet spectrum reported here and in our previous paper are expected to be also observable in these stars . however , for ngc 1624 - 2 , future uv observations will likely reveal a considerably larger variability in the wind profiles than the ones seen so far , since its dipole field is estimated to be about 20 kg ( wade et al .",
    "such a field is about 8 times more intense than in any other known magnetic o - type star .",
    "the of?p class now stands out among the o - type stars as magnetic variables .",
    "they represent therefore an ideal astrophysical laboratory for the study of stellar wind confinement and magnetic field effects in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "the progress achieved so far shows that multiwavelength analyses are crucial for a complete description of their properties .",
