    "the cavities of elliptical / roundish planetary nebulae ( pne ) are not empty but instead filled - up with hot gas originating from the shock - heated fast stellar wind .",
    "space - born x - ray telescopes ( rosat , xmm - newton , chandra ) revealed that these wind - blown `` bubbles '' are the source of rather soft x - ray emission , with typical plasma temperatures between 1 and 3 mk ( see kastner  2012 ) .",
    "the low plasma temperature observed is substantially _ below _ the post - shock temperature of about 10 mk expected from the high observed velocities of the stellar wind .",
    "possible `` cooling '' processes are either heat conduction in the absence of magnetic fields ( soker 1994 ; steffen  2008 ) and/or dynamical mixing of matter across the bubble / nebula interface ( toal & arthur 2016 ) .",
    "the latest 2d simulations by @xcite suggest that heat conduction is indispensable for achieving the observed high x - ray emission measures .",
    "the case of bd+30@xmath03639 is special in three aspects : i ) a hydrogen - poor wind interacts with a nebular shell of normal , hydrogen - rich composition ; ii ) it is the brightest pn x - ray source , allowing to take high - resolution spectra ( yu  2009 ) ; iii ) it is a young , still unevolved nebula , obviously shortly after the conversion to a hydrogen - poor central star has taken place .",
    "a detailed analysis of the x - ray spectrum with respect to elemental abundance ratios and the existence of a possible abundance discontinuity within the bubble produced by heat conduction is thus very rewarding .",
    "all the existing spectral analyses of this nebula are based on simple plasma models with constant densities and temperatures . in their analysis of the bubble of bd+30@xmath03639 , @xcite and @xcite",
    "needed a two - temperature plasma ( 1.9 and 3.0 mk ) to account for the emission from species with different degree of ionisation .",
    "the derived chemical abundances appeared to be rather unusual : very high ratios of c / o and ne / o , exceeding by far the corresponding solar ratios .    from the physical point of view ,",
    "such a low - temperature plasma is fully inconsistent with its outer and inner boundary conditions , viz . the nebular shell and the fast stellar wind . in the following we report briefly on our new approach to analyse the x - ray emission from hot bubbles by means of a physically more sound model .",
    "details will be published in a forthcoming journal paper .",
    "our newly developed analysis tool is based on self - similar solutions for wind - blown bubbles formed by the interaction of two spherical winds with different densities and velocities , as developed by zhekov & perinotto ( 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "these so - called zp96-bubbles contain heat conduction across the bubble from the reverse wind shock to the contact discontinuity / conduction front .",
    "the general properties of these bubbles can be characterised as follows : + _ inner boundary condition .",
    "_ power - law representation of the fast stellar wind from an evolving 0.595 m@xmath2 central star , time - dependent mass - loss rate and velocity , adapted for bd+30@xmath03639 according to @xcite .",
    "+ _ outer boundary condition . _",
    "constant slow wind with explored parameter ranges @xmath3 m@xmath2yr@xmath4 and 10  40 kms@xmath4 .",
    "+ _ chemical composition .",
    "_ each bubble has either a hydrogen - deficient ( `` wr '' ; marcolino  2007 ) or hydrogen - rich ( `` pn '' ) chemical composition , with appropriate conduction coefficients . also , chemically inhomogeneous bubbles are constructed to allow for `` evaporated '' pn matter behind the conduction front .",
    "the wr composition is extremely helium- , carbon- , and oxygen - rich : he : c : o = 0.43:0.51:0.06 by mass ( marcolino  2007 ) .",
    "+ _ x - ray emission . _",
    "the x - ray spectrum is computed by means of the well - documented chianti code , v6.0.1 ( dere  2009 ) .",
    "altogether , about 1000 bubbles have been generated , spanning ages from 200 to 1000 years , corresponding characteristic x - ray temperatures , @xmath5 ( eq .  17 in steffen  2008 ) , between 1.1 and 3.9 mk ( wr ) or between 1.1 and 6.8 mk ( pn ) .",
    "wr - bubbles with ages of 400500 yr have sizes and x - ray luminosities which correspond well to the respective values observed for bd+30@xmath03639 .",
    "the structure of a bubble with a chemical discontinuity is displayed in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "our analysis of the x - ray emission from bd+30@xmath03639 s bubble rests exclusively on the high - resolution observations reported in @xcite .",
    "we first used our zp96-bubbles with wr composition to fix the characteristic plasma temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the result is seen in fig.[tx ] .",
    "one sees that all bubbles nearly degenerate so that a unique plasma temperature can easily be derived from the oxygen and neon line ratios : @xmath6 mk .",
    "this temperature value , obtained from the zp96 bubbles , is also marginally consistent with magnesium .",
    "we emphasise that constant - temperature plasma models _ can not _ provide a unique value for @xmath5 ( fig.[tx ] , right ) !    for the further analysis , we have to check whether those bubbles from our grid that have the right temperature @xmath5 can also reproduce the observed line ratios of carbon and neon with respect to oxygen .",
    "however , it turns out that _ none _ of our bubbles with homogeneous wr composition is able to reproduce the observed line ratios ne / c and o / c ( fig.[consistence ] )",
    ". the discrepancies amount to one order of magnitude , at least !     -1 mm    the large discrepancy between models and observation seen in the right line ratio diagram in fig.[consistence ] can not be remedied by changing the input abundances of our wr composition because they are fixed by the analyses of the stellar wind of bd+30@xmath03639 ( e.g.  marcolino  2007 ) , with the exception of neon whose abundance has been chosen by us .",
    "instead , one has to conclude that the bubble of bd+30@xmath03639 contains , as the consequence of `` evaporation '' , some hydrogen - rich pn matter immediately behind the conduction front .",
    "the pn - matter contains much less carbon ( and oxygen as well ) , so that even small amounts of pn matter will drastically change the carbon line strengths , and to a lesser degree those of oxygen and neon lines because the corresponding ions reside in the inner , hotter bubble regions .",
    "figure[consistence.2 ] illustrates how the inclusion of pn matter changes the relevant line ratios .",
    "the discrepancy in the abundance sensitive panel ( middle ) is substantially reduced , although there is still some disagreement between the models and the observations .",
    "the square represents our  best - fit  model as a compromise between the temperature criteria and the abundance ratios : @xmath7 with age = 500 yr ( cf .",
    "fig[fig1 ] ) , together with appropriate bubble size and x - ray luminosity .",
    "so far we have implicitly assumed that the bubble s ne abundance , which is not really constrained by photospheric / wind analyses , comes from the complete processing of cno matter into n , followed by conversion to ne during a thermal pulse on the agb .",
    "this leads to a mass fraction of 0.022 . by comparing the observed ne / o line ratio with the model predictions ,",
    "we conclude that the ne abundance in the bubble of bd+30@xmath03639 must be higher by a factor of about 2.5 ( compared to oxygen ) , i.e. we have about equal amounts ( by mass ) of o and ne ( at least @xmath10.06 ) ! combined with a higher o / c ratio as proposed by @xcite , full consistency between both the temperature sensitive and abundance sensitive diagrams in fig.[consistence.2 ] is achieved . in this case",
    ", the ne content would be even higher ( up to 0.09 by mass ) .",
    "we have developed a new tool for analysing the x - ray emission from wind - blown bubbles with thermal conduction .",
    "application to existing high - resolution data for bd+30@xmath03639 shows that its x - ray line emission can only be explained if the bubble contains i ) helium- , carbon- , and oxygen - enriched matter as found in the stellar photosphere / wind , especially enriched by neon , and ii ) a shell of hydrogen - rich pn matter of about 3% by mass behind the conduction front .",
    "it appears that heat conduction is a viable option for explaining the diffuse x - ray emission from wind - blown bubbles .",
    "more high - resolution x - ray observations are urgently needed for further testing our analytical bubble models . of course , new analyses of existing low - resolution x - ray spectra would also benefit from our heat - conduction chemically stratified bubble models ."
