    "for more than 30 years , experiments studying relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath34 ) collisions have been carried out in laboratories in europe and the united states .",
    "the main motivation has been to test the hypothesis that strongly interacting matter at energy densities exceeding about 1 gev / fm@xmath13 exists in the form of deconfined quarks and gluons , eventually forming the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "recent results from the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) seem to confirm this conjecture .",
    "the data suggest that the threshold for the onset of deconfinement is located at the low sps energies @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter can be presented in terms of temperature @xmath36 and baryochemical potential @xmath37 .",
    "qcd - inspired calculations suggest that the phase boundary between hadrons and qgp is of first order at large values of @xmath37 , ending in a critical point of second order and then turning into a continuous rapid transition at low @xmath37 @xcite",
    ". the location of the critical point may be close to the @xmath38 values found for the freeze - out of the hadron system produced in collisions of heavy nuclei at sps energies .",
    "the study of fluctuations is an important tool for localizing the phase boundary and the critical point . in particular ,",
    "significant transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations are expected to appear for systems that hadronize from qgp and freeze - out near the critical point of qcd @xcite .",
    "the location of the freeze - out point in the phase diagram can be moved by varying the collision energy and the size of the collision system .",
    "a nonmonotonic evolution of fluctuations with these collision parameters can serve as a signature for the phase transition and the critical point .",
    "these considerations motivated an extensive program of fluctuation studies at the sps and rhic accelerators .",
    "so far for central pb+pb collisions , the analysis of multiplicity fluctuations has found only small effects without significant structure in the energy dependence in the whole sps energy domain @xcite .",
    "the measured net charge fluctuations can be explained by the effects of global charge conservation @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of event - by - event fluctuations of the @xmath39 ratio , on the other hand , shows an interesting increase toward lower energies @xcite that can be attributed to the onset of deconfinement @xcite rather than to the critical point .",
    "this paper presents results of the na49 experiment from a study of transverse momentum @xmath0 fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at 20@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 , 40@xmath1 , 80@xmath1 , and 158@xmath1 gev .",
    "it extends a previous study @xcite that investigated the system size dependence of @xmath0 fluctuations at the top sps energy .",

    "[ s : results ] .",
    "a summary closes the paper .",
    "various methods can be used to measure event - by - event @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "a natural observable is the distribution of the average transverse momentum of the events defined as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the multiplicity of accepted particles in a given event and @xmath47 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath48-th particle .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 will be compared with the corresponding histogram obtained for artificially produced `` mixed events '' . in mixed events ,",
    "all particles are by construction uncorrelated ( each particle in a given mixed event is taken from a different real event with the same multiplicity ) but follow the experimental inclusive three - momentum spectra as well as the distribution of multiplicity .",
    "the second observable used in this work is the @xmath4 measure , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used also in our previous analysis @xcite . following the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can define the single - particle variable @xmath49 with the bar denoting averaging over the single - particle inclusive distribution . as seen , @xmath50 .",
    "further , one introduces the event variable @xmath51 , which is a multiparticle analog of @xmath52 , defined as @xmath53 where the summation runs over particles in a given event .",
    "note , that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 represents averaging over events .",
    "finally , the @xmath4 measure is defined as    @xmath56    the @xmath4 measure has two important properties .",
    "first , @xmath4 vanishes when the system consists of particles that are emitted independently ( no interparticle correlations ) , and the single particle momentum spectrum is independent of multiplicity .",
    "second , if an @xmath34 collision can be treated as an incoherent superposition of independent @xmath57 interactions ( superposition model ) , then @xmath4 has a constant value , the same for @xmath34 and @xmath57 interactions .",
    "this implies that , in particular , @xmath4 does not depend on the impact parameter ( centrality ) , if the @xmath34 collision is a simple superposition of @xmath57 interactions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 is independent of changes of the size of a compact acceptance domain provided the correlation scale ( range ) , @xmath58 , is much smaller than the size of the acceptance region , @xmath59 . in the limit of large correlation length and small acceptance the magnitude of @xmath40 is proportional to the multiplicity of accepted particles .",
    "thus for a small acceptance @xmath40 approaches zero .",
    "the approximately linear dependence of @xmath4 on the fraction of accepted particles in the limit @xmath60 suggested the introduction of the fluctuation measures @xmath44 @xcite and @xmath41 @xcite , which for large particle multiplicities are proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "these properties of the fluctuation measures should be taken into account when results are compared and discussed . finally , we note that the magnitude of @xmath40 decreases with the fraction of randomly lost particles , e.g. , due to incomplete reconstruction efficiency .    in spite of the above mentioned advantages , there is an important disadvantage of using @xmath4 in the fluctuation analysis .",
    "while @xmath4 is sensitive to the presence of particle correlations in a system , it does not provide information on the nature of the correlation .",
    "several effects can contribute to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , to achieve a better understanding of the fluctuation structure , it is useful to also employ a more differential method @xcite .",
    "the correlations can be studied by plotting the cumulative @xmath0 variables for particle pairs .",
    "namely , instead of @xmath62 , one can introduce the variable @xmath63 , defined for a particle @xmath48 as @xcite    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the inclusive @xmath62 distribution , normalized to unity , which is obtained from all particles used in the analysis . by construction ,",
    "the @xmath63 variable varies between 0 and 1 with a _ flat _ probability distribution .",
    "two - particle correlation plots , as presented in this paper , are obtained by plotting @xmath66 points for all possible particle pairs within the same event .",
    "the number of pairs in each @xmath66 bin is divided by the mean number of pairs in a bin ( averaged over all @xmath66 bins ) .",
    "this two - dimensional plot is _ uniformly _ populated when no interparticle correlations are present in the system .",
    "nonuniformity signals the presence of interparticle correlations .",
    "for example , when identical particles are studied , bose statistics lead to a ridge along the diagonal of the @xmath66 plot , which starts at @xmath67 and ends at @xmath68 , whereas event - by - event temperature fluctuations produce a saddle - shaped structure @xcite .",
    "na49 is one of the fixed target experiments at the cern sps .",
    "the detector ( see fig .  [ setup ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer used for the study of the hadronic final states produced in @xmath69 , @xmath70nucleus , and nucleus+nucleus collisions .",
    "in particular , centrality selected pb+pb interactions were recorded at 20@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 , 40@xmath1 , 80@xmath1 , and 158@xmath1 gev projectile energies .",
    "the main components of the detector are four large - volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) , which are capable of detecting about 80% of approximately 1500 charged particles created in a central pb+pb collision at 158@xmath1 gev ( the acceptance losses are concentrated mainly in the backward rapidity region and at azimuthal angles along the magnetic field direction ) .",
    "the vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , are located in the magnetic field of two superconducting dipole magnets ( 1.5 and 1.1 t , respectively , at 158@xmath1 gev ; for lower energies , the magnetic field is scaled down in proportion to the beam energy ) .",
    "two other tpcs ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically to the beam line .",
    "the results presented in this paper are analyzed with a global tracking scheme @xcite , which combines track segments that belong to the same physical particle but were detected in different tpcs .",
    "the na49 tpcs allow precise measurements of particle momenta @xmath71 with a resolution of @xmath72 ( gev / c)@xmath73 .",
    "a precise measurement of specific energy loss ( @xmath74 ) in the region of relativistic rise is possible in the tpcs , however , @xmath74 information is not used in this analysis .",
    "the centrality of nuclear collisions is selected by using the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons measured in the downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the vcal is adjusted to cover the projectile spectator region by setting the collimator ( coll ) .",
    "the target is a thin pb foil ( 224 mg / cm@xmath14 ) positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "pb beam particles are identified by means of their charge as seen by a counter ( s2 ) situated in front of the target .",
    "the beam position detectors ( bpd-1/2/3 in fig . [ setup ] ) , which are proportional chambers placed along the beam line , provide a precise measurement of the transverse positions of the incoming beam particles . for pb beams , interactions in the target",
    "are selected by an anti - coincidence of the incoming beam particle with a counter ( s3 ) placed directly behind the target .",
    "details of the na49 detector setup and performance of the tracking software are described in @xcite .",

    "the multiplicities of _ accepted _ charged particles were taken from @xcite , @xcite and from this analysis . ]",
    "it was already explained in sec.[s : measures ] that @xmath4 is independent of acceptance changes provided the correlation scale is much smaller than the size of the acceptance region . on the other hand , when the range of correlations is significantly larger than the acceptance , @xmath4 linearly decreases with decreasing fraction of accepted particles .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 ( @xmath155 ) with energy is not caused by an increasing magnitude of short range ( compared to the acceptance ) correlations . as mentioned above , these correlations , if dominant , would lead to an independence of @xmath4 ( @xmath158 ) of the acceptance , in contrast to the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fipt_fraction_acc_oth_exp ] .",
    "curiously enough , the increase of @xmath155 with growing @xmath76 for the star data is associated with a decrease of the fraction of accepted particles .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the increase is caused by a _",
    "growing _ magnitude of medium- and long - range correlations ( correlation length comparable to or larger than the acceptance ) .",
    "this effect may result from an increasing contribution of particles originating from decays of high mass resonances and/or from ( mini)jet fragmentation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath4 ( @xmath155 ) fluctuation measure , @xmath159 used by the ceres experiment , does not show any dramatic differences when going from sps to rhic energies @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ sigmapercent_na49_ceres_star ] points were estimated from the values of @xmath4 using the following equations : @xmath160 and finally @xmath161 @xcite . for a given @xmath117 value",
    "the errors of @xmath159 ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) were calculated as : @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "finally the na49 @xmath166 corresponds to @xmath167 .",
    "the same procedure was applied for statistical and systematic errors .",
    "although the statistical and systematic errors of @xmath4 are comparable at ceres and na49 , the errors of @xmath159 are much higher in na49 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath168 and for @xmath4 close to zero ( the case of na49 ) a small variation of @xmath4 results in much higher changes of @xmath159 . ] ) .",
    "also the phenix results confirm that the magnitude of the @xmath169 fluctuation measure exhibits only a small variation in a very wide energy range between @xmath76 = 22 and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "it appears that the increase of @xmath4 ( @xmath155 ) with the accepted particle multiplicity is approximately linear ( fig .",
    "[ fipt_fraction_acc_oth_exp ] ) . consequently , @xmath170 , which is proportional to @xmath171 , becomes approximately independent of multiplicity or collision energy .     as a function of energy measured for all charged particles by the na49 , ceres , and star experiments .",
    "the na49 points are obtained for the forward - rapidity region in a limited azimuthal angle acceptance ; the ceres ( @xcite ; point for 8% most central pb+au collisions taken from ref .",

    "width=377 ]    a direct comparison of event - by - event @xmath0 fluctuations between different experiments , based on the method of determining the magnitude of residual temperature fluctuations @xcite , has been presented in ref .",
    "for the most central interactions , the estimated temperature fluctuations are on the level of 1.8% , 1.7% , 1.3% , and 0.6% for phenix ( @xmath76 = 200 gev ) , star ( @xmath76 = 130 gev ) , ceres ( @xmath76 = 17 gev ) , and na49 ( @xmath76 = 17 gev ) , respectively .",
    "this analysis confirms that , indeed , there is no significant energy dependence of temperature fluctuations between sps and rhic energies .",
    "transverse momentum event - by - event fluctuations were studied for central pb+pb interactions at 20@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 , 40@xmath1 , 80@xmath1 , and 158@xmath1 gev .",
    "the analysis was limited to the forward - rapidity region ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "three fluctuation observables were studied : the fluctuations of average transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) of the event , the @xmath4 fluctuation measure , and transverse momentum two - particle correlations .",
    "the following results were obtained :    * the distribution of event - by - event average transverse momentum @xmath3 is close to that for mixed events , indicating that fluctuations are predominantly of statistical nature . *",
    "the fluctuation measure @xmath40 has values close to zero and shows no significant energy dependence .",
    "* two - particle transverse momentum correlations are found to be negligible except for contributions from bose - einstein correlations . *",
    "the urqmd model reproduces the trend of the data . *",
    "the observed smallness of @xmath0 fluctuations in the sps energy range is consistent with other published measurements . *",
    "no sudden increase or nonmonotonic behavior was observed in the energy dependence of @xmath40 nor the scaled variance @xmath151 of multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "such effects have been suggested for freeze - out near the critical point of qcd .    since the limited acceptance of na49",
    "is expected to reduce the signal from possible critical fluctuations , measurements in larger acceptance are still needed . moreover , employing intermediate size nuclei may possibly move the freeze - out point closer to the critical point .",
    "these considerations motivated several new experiments planned in the sps energy region : na61 at the cern sps @xcite , star and phenix at the bnl rhic @xcite , mpd at the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) @xcite , and cbm at the gsi facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) heavy - ion synchrotron ( sis-300 ) @xcite .",
    "the future results , together with the existing data , will cover a broad range in the ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) plane and should lead to significant progress in the search for the critical point .",
