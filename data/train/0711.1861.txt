    "m dwarfs are by far the most numerous of nearby stars , comprising roughly 75% of the galactic stellar population .",
    "the sheer number of m dwarfs in our local solar neighborhood makes them attractive targets for planet - finding missions , while their low masses make them a likely place for discovering earth - mass worlds in radial velocity surveys .",
    "however , these cool neighbors also pose a unique set of problems for their resident planets , and so have been largely dismissed in years past in favor of more tractable cases .",
    "recently , however , there has been renewed interest in m dwarfs as hosts for habitable worlds .",
    "the case for m dwarf planets has been outlined in @xcite , bringing together studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others to propose that perhaps the case for habitability is not so dire after all . as further timely motivation ,",
    "@xcite recently announced the discovery of the lowest mass planet to date ( m@xmath1 5m@xmath2 ) , orbiting in the habitable zone of a m3.5 dwarf , gl 581 .",
    "the near - uv emission of m dwarfs remains an outstanding unknown , affecting both our understanding of the basic atmospheric structure in these stars and the potential habitability of attendant planets . due to their cool effective temperatures",
    ", m dwarfs exhibit almost no continuum emission in the near - uv .",
    "however , a large fraction of these stars possess surface magnetic fields , which give rise to a steady - state , hot outer atmosphere and transient events such as starspots and flares .",
    "non - radiative heating processes transfer energy from the magnetic field into the stellar atmosphere to power these phenomena , producing significant uv output in the form of chromospheric ( t@xmath3k ) , transition region ( t@xmath4k ) and coronal ( t@xmath5k ) emission .",
    "chromospheric near - uv emission can have critical consequences for planetary atmospheres , as it directly impacts the habitability of a neighboring planet through its role in the production of ozone , as well as its implications for long - term survival ( and thus detectability ) of biomarker gases ( such as n@xmath6o and ch@xmath7 ) .",
    "preliminary studies of m dwarf habitability zones indicate that the typical chromospheric uv flux from an active star will produce observable ozone layers , comparable to that of earth , on terrestrial planets around m dwarfs ( see @xcite , figure 3 ) .",
    "however , models of planetary atmospheres around relatively inactive m stars are presently based on stellar model photosphere predictions due to the lack of near - uv observational data",
    ".    the data described in this paper also provide crucial constraints for new model atmospheres , which may be used to address a number of outstanding problems in stellar astrophysics .",
    "for example , optical ( h@xmath8 ) observations of nearby stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ) show that the active fraction ( as measured by h@xmath8 emission with equivalent width @xmath9 1@xmath10 ) increases dramatically from types m0 to m6 , peaks near spectral type m7-m8 and declines thereafter .",
    "the strength of activity , as measured by the ratio of the luminosity in h@xmath8 compared to the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath11 ) , also declines at late types ( burgasser et al .",
    "2002 ; cruz & reid 2002 ; west et al . 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been suggested that activity in ultracool dwarfs is confined primarily to large flares , with little or no `` quiescent '' emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , stis / mama observations of active m7-m9 dwarfs by @xcite showed that quiescent transition region ( c iv ) emission is present at levels comparable to those seen in earlier active m dwarfs .",
    "the difficulty in interpreting these intriguing empirical data lies primarily in our lack of a theory of magnetic dynamo field production and subsequent atmospheric heating . at types later than about m3 , stars become fully convective and a solar - type shell dynamo can no longer operate .",
    "the theory of @xmath12 or turbulent dynamos is not yet developed enough to provide predictions or guidance regarding the efficacy of magnetic field production .",
    "progress may be made , however , on the atmospheric heating problem .",
    "it has not been established whether the drop in active fraction and activity level seen at types later than m7 is a result of the particular diagnostic we are using ( h@xmath8 ) .",
    "if magnetic heating is still present , but the atmospheric structure has changed in these late type stars , emission may occur preferentially in other lines .",
    "in particular , the relatively unobserved 1700 - 3000@xmath10 wavelength region contains numerous strong emission lines important to the energy balance of the outer atmosphere , including the resonance lines of mg ii and a host of fe ii emission lines .",
    "these lines provide additional information on the atmospheric structure at chromospheric and transition region temperatures , and therefore to the underlying heating processes .",
    "our sample comprises 107 nearby low mass dwarfs , extensively studied in the palomar / michigan state university ( pmsu ) survey of nearby stars [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "we have homogeneous optical spectra for nearly all of these stars , which allowed us to choose a wide distribution of spectral types and chromospheric activity strengths ( the equivalent width of the h@xmath8 line is used a proxy for chromospheric activity ) .",
    "prior spectroscopic analysis of these stars also allowed us to select our sample to exclude known spectroscopic binaries .",
    "roughly half of the stars in our sample were previously observed with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) at near - uv wavelengths ( see discussion , section 3.1 ) .",
    "in addition , hst / stis spectra of the nuv and transition region fuv emission are available for several of the most active stars in our sample .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observed 29 m dwarfs and 2 late k dwarfs from our sample using the advanced camera for surveys high resolution channel ( acs hrc ) with the pr200l prism in snapshot mode .",
    "table 1 provides a summary of the observed sample .",
    "observations spanned the period of 3 august 2005 to 11 june 2006 , terminating with an electronics glitch in the hrc and subsequent safing of the instrument .",
    "the observed sample ranges from spectral type k7 to m5 and includes both inactive and active stars .",
    "all but two of the observed stars lie within 10 parsecs of the sun .    with the failure of the stis instrument in 2004 , the pr200l prism became the only spectroscopic element on board hst capable of near - uv spectroscopic obsevations .",
    "the pr200l has a highly nonlinear dispersion , ranging from 5.3@xmath10 pix@xmath13 at 1800@xmath10 to 105@xmath10 pix@xmath13 at 3500@xmath10 . by 5000@xmath10",
    "the dispersion decreases to 563@xmath10 pix@xmath13 , in essence depositing all redwards flux onto just a few pixels of the ccd detector . the rapidly decreasing dispersion towards longer wavelengths results in what has become known as the `` red pile - up , '' making the pr200l data problematic for the study of intrinsically red objects , where scattered light from the red end can contaminate or drown the faint uv signal .",
    "fortunately , diffraction spikes from the red pileup lie at an angle to the dispersion direction , causing the degree of contamination to lessen towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "taking advantage of this fact , we were able to choose an extraction window that minimized the scattered light contamination .",
    "spectra were extracted in pyraf using the axe slitless spectroscopy reduction package , which consists of several tasks designed to handle large format spectroscopic slitless images .",
    "observations for an individual star consist of a `` direct '' or undispersed image taken with the f330w filter , followed by a dispersed image taken with the pr200l prism . in the reductions ,",
    "the position of the star on the direct image is used in combination with telescope position information from the header to locate the spectrum on the subsequent dispersed image and assign a wavelength to each pixel in the spectrum .",
    "axe first generates pixel extraction tables ( pets ) , which contain a spectral description for each pixel in the spectrum .",
    "pixels in the extraction window are then projected onto the spectral trace in individual wavelength bins , and their signal is weighted by the fractional area of the pixel that falls in a given bin .",
    "flux calibration follows using sensitivity curves for the relevant observing mode ( here , the hrc with pr200l prism ) . although the potential for contamination by neighboring objects in an image exists for all slitless spectroscopy ( e.g. when dispersing stars that lie in a crowded field ) , all of our targets were either solitary or well separated from others in their images , so geometric contamination was not an issue .",
    "the reduction tasks require very little user interaction , most information being supplied by stsdas configuration files or drawn from the image headers themselves . at the user s discretion , however , are the parameters of the extraction window .",
    "as the diffraction spikes from the red pileup lie very close to the nuv spectrum , a careful balance must be struck between including as much of the already - meager nuv flux as possible , while excluding the influence of the nearby artifact .",
    "as previously mentioned , the diffraction spikes lie at an angle to the spectrum , merging with the spectrum at the red end .",
    "the artifact and spectrum diverge towards shorter wavelengths , but if a wide extraction window is used , part of the artifact may still be included .",
    "the wavelength extent of contamination is therefore a function of the width of the extraction window , where a wide window includes the artifact over more of the spectrum than a narrow window does . in order to quantify the effect of the artifact on the output spectrum , we experimented both with a variety of extraction windows centered on the spectrum , and with extractions offset below the spectrum ( i.e. a slice across the diffraction spike ) and above the spectrum ( where no artifact was present ) .",
    "after much experimentation , we determined a narrow extraction window half - width of 1 pixel to be the best choice . to quantify the uncertainty in our spectra , we extracted a spectrum from the background ( offset 3 pixels above the spectrum ) to examine the pixel - to - pixel variation .",
    "variations in the background spectra were used to compute the error bars that are shown on all plots in this paper .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting near - uv spectrum for one of the most active stars in our sample , ad leo ( dm3e , d=4.9pc ) .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the flux increases towards longer wavelengths as contamination from the red pileup becomes more apparent . in figure 1",
    "we also compare prior iue observations of ad leo to our extracted acs spectrum .",
    "plotted at top is the iue spectrum , taken with the low resolution grating . at center",
    "we plot a simulated prism spectrum generated by using the iue spectrum as input to slim , the acs slitless spectroscopy simulator .",
    "slim uses an input spectrum of arbitrary resolution to simulate an acs grism or prism image using a specified configuration ( in our case , the hrc with the pr200l prism ) . as slim",
    "does not account for the artifacts introduced by the red pileup , the simulated spectrum represents a `` best - case scenario '' , devoid of contaminating scattered light .",
    "the simulated spectrum shows three main features : a peak at 2800@xmath10 , attributable to the strong mg ii h and k lines , and two other peaks , at 2600@xmath10 and 2400@xmath10 , both due to collections of strong fe ii lines clustered around those wavelengths .",
    "these features are also seen in the observed acs spectrum for ad leo , plotted at the bottom of the figure .",
    "the flux in the mg ii feature at 2800@xmath10 matches almost exactly between the simulated and observed spectra , and the fluxes in the two fe ii features at 2600@xmath10 and 2400@xmath10 are also quite comparable .",
    "figure 2 plots the observed nuv spectra for the entire sample , in approximate order of strong to weak ultraviolet emission . for the most active stars",
    ", we clearly resolve the main spectral features discussed in figure 1 .",
    "as activity decreases , emission from the mg ii feature at 2800@xmath10 remains prominent , but the fe ii features become less defined .",
    "also , for a few objects , only the emission peak near 2600@xmath10 is seen , without significant emission at 2800@xmath10 or 2400@xmath10 ( see for example gl 273 , gl 876 and gl 682 in figure 2b ) .",
    "although the prism data have very low resolution , we were able to extratct an estimate of the fluxes in the regions near the strong lines .",
    "the spectra were fit by four gaussians ( centers held fixed at @xmath14 = 2385@xmath10 , 2560@xmath10 , 2640@xmath10 and 2800@xmath10 ) and a second order polynomial .",
    "the area under the gaussians can then be used to characterize the flux due to emission features near those wavelengths .",
    "the result of one such fit is shown in figure 3 , and the fluxes measured for all spectra are listed in table 2 . if no flux is listed for a particular feature , that feature did not contribute significantly to the spectrum or the fit was unreliable .",
    "approximately half of our observed sample have existing iue low resolution spectra .",
    "linsky et al .",
    "( 1982 ) carried out an early pioneering study of ultraviolet emission in active cool stars with iue , while a later comparative study of mg ii h and k emission with x - ray emission was undertaken by mathioudakis & doyle ( 1989 ) .",
    "however , the majority of stars observed with iue are active , and the few lower activity objects with iue spectra have relatively low s / n .    in order to better compare the iue and acs observations , we used the existing iue spectra to simulate acs spectra with slim .",
    "as previously discussed , the results for ad leo are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the three peaks in the ad leo acs spectrum at 2400@xmath10 , 2600@xmath10 and 2800@xmath10 are recreated in the slim simulated spectrum , and the fluxes in the data and simulated spectrum are a good match within the uncertainties .",
    "not all of the slim simulated spectra gave such good results many of the noisier iue spectra produce accordingly noisier simulated spectra , so comparison between the simulated and observed fluxes is unreliable . as the best - exposed iue spectra all had prominent mg ii emission , we chose to compare the mg ii flux between our acs data and the iue spectra as a test of our ability to measure accurate line fluxes .",
    "the flux in the acs spectra due to the gaussian measured at @xmath15 = 2800@xmath10 was taken to be representative of the mg ii flux .",
    "the iue mg ii lines were fit with a single gaussian as the h & k lines were blended in the low resolution data .",
    "figure 4 shows iue versus acs mg ii surface fluxes , calculated using radii given in @xcite table 4.1 , and distances from trigonometric parallax measurements .",
    "the brightest and most active stars , for which mg ii emission was most prominent , show a good match between the acs and iue measurements .",
    "fainter objects were probably more affected by scattered light in the acs spectra , and therefore are measured as having more flux than the iue spectra .",
    "many of our stars have x - ray measurements from rosat .",
    "figure 5 shows the surface acs mg ii flux versus the rosat surface flux .",
    "our results are very similar to figure 1 from @xcite .",
    "their flux - flux relation for dme stars ( stars with h@xmath8 in emission , represented as filled black circles ) is overplotted as a dotted line . a slight positive offset exists between the x - ray fluxes and the overplotted fit , as the @xcite correlation used measurements from einstein and exosat rather than rosat [ @xcite ] , but otherwise our results are in excellent agreement .",
    "most of the stars in our sample also have measured h@xmath8 equivalent widths , originally reported in @xcite and included in table 1 of this paper .",
    "using the @xmath16 factor of @xcite , we calculated the flux in h@xmath8 for each star . figure 6 shows the computed h@xmath8 flux versus the log of the acs mg ii flux , where negative flux values imply that the h@xmath8 line is in absorption .    taken together , figures 5 and 6 present a complex picture of chromospheric and coronal emission . while the most `` active '' stars , such as ad leo , have strong emission in mg ii , x - rays and h@xmath8 , many of the stars possessing the highest amounts of mg ii emission ( e.g. gl 205 and gl 299 ) have relatively weak x - ray emission and h@xmath8 in absorption .",
    "these results indicate that there is no simple relationship between the activity level ( as indicated by h@xmath8 ) and where emission preferentially occurs , and the use of simple scaling relations between these line fluxes may be misleading .",
    "we compare the near - uv observational data with predictions from the radiative hydrodynamic models of allred et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the models use solutions to the 1-d equations of radiative hydrodynamics , including non - lte radiative transfer in h , he and ca ii , with flare heating provided by an electron beam .",
    "the results include predictions of atmospheric structure ( temperature , density profiles ) , velocity and line profiles at many time steps during an episode of flare heating .",
    "we used the results of the allred preflare and f10 models to investigate the mg ii and fe ii emission in and out of flaring states ( the f10 model used here represents an average mid - flare atmosphere near a time step of @xmath17 85 sec ; see allred et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) .",
    "in addition we used two other preflare models , scaled to be either cooler or hotter at a given column mass than the allred preflare atmosphere .",
    "the four atmospheric models are designated here as pf , flare , lplt ( low pressure low temperature ) , and hpht ( high pressure high temperature ) , for the preflare , flare , cooler and hotter atmospheres , respectively .",
    "the model atmospheres are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the allred et al .",
    "models only include h , he and ca ii in the detailed non - lte treatment .",
    "however , thousands of other transitions ( including those of mg and fe ) are included as background opacity in lte .",
    "the solar models of abbett & hawley ( 1999 ; see section 2.4 ) compare the effects of including detailed non - lte calculations for mg ii or treating it as background opacity , and they find that there is little change in the total cooling rate for these two cases .",
    "thus , including mg and fe in non - lte is likely to make little difference in the overall energy balance of the atmosphere .",
    "however , since allred et al .",
    "( 2006 ) did not predict the mg ii or fe ii line profiles which comprise the majority of emission lines in our observed wavelength range , we analyzed our atmosphere models with the ` rh ' non - lte radiative transfer code described in uitenbroek ( 2001 ) .",
    "the rh code is based on the multi - level accelerated lambda ( mali ) formalism of rybicki & hummer ( 1991 , 1992 ) , which allows both bound - bound and bound - free radiative transitions to overlap in wavelength .",
    "it also includes the effects of partial redistribution for strong bound - bound transitions such as mg ii h and k. the mg ii calculations for the pf and flare atmospheres were originally reported in @xcite .",
    "the non - lte atomic level populations were calculated for a 9 level hydrogen atom with continua , an 11 level mg ii ion with continua and a 143 level fe ii ion with continuum .",
    "other atomic transitions ( of he , ca , c , o , si , al , nai and n ) and molecular transitions ( of h@xmath6 + , c@xmath6 , n@xmath6 , o@xmath6 , ch , co , cn , nh , no oh and h@xmath60 ) are included as background opacity in lte .    while the pr200l resolution is clearly insufficient for comparison with the detailed model line profiles , we can use these model spectra as inputs to slim , giving us pr200l simulated low resolution spectra for mg ii and fe ii . in figures 8 - 11",
    ", we show the model spectra for mg ii and fe ii for each atmosphere , the slim simulated acs spectra for mg ii and fe ii separately , and the combined result .",
    "all fluxes have been scaled to a star with the radius and distance of ad leo ( r=0.41r@xmath18 , d=4.9pc ) [ @xcite , @xcite ] to enable direct comparison to the data .",
    "overall , the shape of the model spectra are qualitatively similar to the observed spectra .",
    "one notable feature is that the cooler atmospheres ( lplt and pf ) do not predict a strong emission peak at 2800@xmath10 , and instead predict a trough centered there .",
    "the resulting spectra are then reminiscent of the acs data for less active stars , such as gl 889.1 and gl 825 ( shown in figure 2b ) . in every case ,",
    "our models overpredict the fe ii emission .",
    "the result for our `` flare '' atmosphere shows the strong mg ii emission at 2800@xmath10 that we see in many spectra ( especially of the active stars ) , but the fe ii emission predicted by this same atmosphere vastly overwhelms the mg ii peak , which is not observed .",
    "we reproduce the observed peaks in the acs data due to fe ii , though emission at the shorter wavelengths is stronger than predicted .",
    "we note , however , that in the iue simulated spectrum of ad leo ( figure 1 ) , the fe ii emission at 2400@xmath10 was stronger than observed in the acs spectrum it therefore may be that the shortest wavelengths in the acs spectra are not accurately measured as the signal is extremely faint .",
    "we used a combination of the resulting model prism spectra to match the acs observations of gl 876 , gl 825 , gl 889.1 , gl 273 , and ad leo .",
    "these specific stars were selected on the basis of their relatively well exposed spectra and variety of activity levels ( as inferred by their h@xmath8 equivalent widths).in order to gain insight into the structure of the active regions of the chromosphere , we determine a `` fill factor '' , or effective surface area coverage of which model spectrum best fits these stars . in several cases , the observed data are best fit by a combination of spectra from different atmospheres , indicating the probable existence of multiple components in the chromospheres of these stars .",
    "the best fits were determined by eye in each case , with preference toward matching the flux between 2200@xmath10 and 2900@xmath10 .",
    "wavelengths longward of 2900@xmath10 lie nearer the red pile - up , and therefore are more likely to be unreliable ( for example , slim simulations of both models and iue data never recreate the deep dip at 2950@xmath10 , which is seen in all the acs spectra ) .",
    "figure 12 shows the fit to the spectrum of gl 876 .",
    "we find that the pf atmosphere provides the best fit to the observations , with a fill factor of @xmath171.3% .",
    "gl 876 is of particular interest for astrobiology , as it is host to 3 known extrasolar planets , including a @xmath177.5m@xmath19 `` super earth '' .",
    "gl 876 has an h@xmath8 absorption line ( ew@xmath20 = @xmath210.2@xmath10 ) , indicating that it possesses a low - to - intermediate level of chromospheric activity ( as compared with m dwarfs with h@xmath8 lines in emission , which have a high level of chromospheric heating and are thus deemed `` active '' ) .",
    "m dwarfs with very little activity and those with moderate activity can not be distinguished on the basis of h@xmath8 alone , as both weak and intermediate chromospheres show h@xmath8 in absorption [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , information from other chromospheric lines ( such as ca ii , mg ii and fe ii ) may serve to break this degeneracy .",
    "with h@xmath8 in absorption and a spectral type of dm4 , gl 876 is roughly equivalent in temperature and activity to the 3100k inactive star used in the @xcite biomarker study .",
    "@xcite used a model spectrum from @xcite with no chromospheric flux for their cool , inactive m dwarf however , it is debatable whether such a star exists , as most m dwarfs show evidence of a chromosphere at some level [ @xcite ] .",
    "low - to - intermediate activity stars , like gl 876 , are the true unknowns in studies of the effect of stellar flux on attendant planets while they may not have the strong chromspheric emission of very active stars like ad leo , their near - uv emission may still be non - neglible .    scaling our spectrum of gl 876 to the top - of - atmosphere flux for a planet in the habitable zone ( semimajor axes given in @xcite table 1 )",
    ", we find that the so - called `` inactive '' gl 876 actually has an appreciable near - uv flux . in figure 13",
    ", we plot our results for gl 876 side by side with a similarly scaled spectrum of ad leo ( again using parameters from @xcite table 1 ) and show that the expected near - uv flux at a planet in the habitable zone is actually comparable for both stars .",
    "results for ozone production and methane chemistry in the atmosphere of a planet around gl 876 would therefore be more in keeping with those given for ad leo , rather than the predicted `` methane runaway '' in planets around quiescent m dwarfs [ @xcite ] .      in figure 14 ,",
    "we plot the resulting model fit to our acs spectrum of gl 273 . here",
    ", the data are best fit by a combination of our lplt and pf atmospheres in roughly equal portion ( 0.6% and 0.5% , respectively .",
    "this fit gives an overall fill factor of @xmath171% for the active regions that produce the near - uv flux .",
    "gl 825 is one of the hotter , more massive stars in our sample .",
    "we find that a combination of the lplt and pf atmosphere model spectra , at 3% and 4.5% fill factor respectively , provides a good match to the majority of the spectrum ( figure 15 ) .",
    "there is an excess of flux at @xmath172750 that our model spectra do not reproduce , however , and increasing the fill factor to match this part of the spectrum then overestimates the fe ii flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "gl 889.1 is best matched by a combination of the lplt and hpht atmospheres , at fill factors of 1.6% and 0.05% respectively . while the spectrum has a similar shape to that of gl 825 , gl 889.1 has more short wavelength flux ( from 2000 to 2200@xmath10 ) that is not well fit without the hotter hpht component .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in figure 16 .",
    "fitting our results for ad leo is challenging , as the models which match the mg ii emission clearly overpredict emission from fe ii .",
    "as some fe ii also contributes flux to the region around 2800@xmath10 , a much smaller fill factor is necessary to match the combined fe ii @xmath22 mg ii model spectra than what one would interpret from mg ii results alone . as",
    "ad leo is a very active star , we first attempt to fit the data with our hottest `` flare '' model ( figure 17 , left panel ) . while a fill factor of 0.25% reproduces roughly the correct amount of flux around 2800@xmath10 and at wavelengths shorter than 2200@xmath10 , the fe ii emission at @xmath17 2400@xmath10 and @xmath172600@xmath10 is much too large . the hpht atmosphere ( also at a fill factor of 0.25% ;",
    "figure 17 , right panel ) produces a much better match to these two fe ii features , but unfortunately does not account for any of the observed mg ii flux . using the mg ii results for our flare model alone , the emission near 2800@xmath10 is well matched with a fill factor of 1.6% . while it is not physical to ignore the fe ii emission , the 1.6% coverage required to reproduce the mg ii flux provides an upper limit estimate on the area filled by this hot `` flare '' component .",
    "we obtained 31 acs pr200l prism spectra of stars , covering spectral types k7 to m5 , and including a variety of activity levels .",
    "the near - uv data presented here provide valuable constraints for both model stellar chromospheres and photochemical models of planetary atmospheres around m dwarfs .",
    "we measured mg ii fluxes for our spectra and compared our results with complementary optical , near - uv and x - ray data .",
    "for those stars in our sample with iue data , we used the iue mg ii flux as a check of our acs prism spectra measurements , and found them roughly consistent .",
    "we also examined the relationship between mg ii emission and rosat measurements of the x - ray flux .",
    "our results agree with those of @xcite , showing a well - defined correlation for the most active dme stars . using existing h@xmath8 measurements for our sample in conjunction with the @xmath16 factor of @xcite",
    ", we computed h@xmath8 fluxes and compared these to our measured mg ii fluxes , finding a complex relationship between the optical and near - uv emission .",
    "together , the mg ii , x - ray and h@xmath8 data discussed here present a complex picture of the chromospheric and coronal emission in these stars .    using the ` rh ' nlte radiative transfer code , we calculated mg ii and fe ii spectra for a suite of model atmospheres .",
    "the resulting model spectra were then degraded to the resolution of the acs prism data using slim , the acs prism spectra simulator .",
    "we compared our results with several of the observed spectra to infer potential chromospheric structure and active region coverage , finding that most stars could be matched by an active region area coverage of a few percent of the stellar surface .",
    "this result is consistent with our findings in @xcite , where we determined that @xmath170.5% of the visible stellar surface was involved in the observed flares . while in many cases",
    "the qualitative shape of the model spectra matched the observations , fe ii was overpredicted for the most active objects .",
    "the empirical results we find for mg ii , x - ray and h@xmath8 pose an interesting challenge for the models .",
    "the model atmospheres described in this paper will be used in future calculations of h@xmath8 and ca ii k , which will then be compared with our results for the near - uv emission .    in the case of gl 876 , a dm4 star that hosts three extrasolar planets , we scaled our observed spectra to match the expected flux at the distance of a planet in the habitable zone .",
    "we compared our results to a similar scaling of our ad leo observation , and then discussed these results in the light of previous studies of m dwarf planet habitability .",
    "we find that our observation of what might be called an `` inactive '' star ( on the basis of h@xmath8 , the usual proxy for activity in late type stars ) actually shows a substantial amount of near - uv flux .",
    "although gl 876 is a lower luminosity and lower activity star than ad leo , the non - negligible near - uv flux and proximity of the habitable zone conspire to make it a similar host for planets .",
