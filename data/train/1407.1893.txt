    "the material symmetry group is reflected in all physical properties of the crystalline material- microscopic as well as macroscopic .",
    "for example , in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal like graphene , the strain energy density function @xmath0 , which relates the change in free energy per unit area ( @xmath0 ) to the measure of elastic strain ( @xmath4 ) ,  possesses the complete point group symmetry of the underlying lattice , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in any constitutive model of the crystal , all symmetries belonging to the material symmetry group should be duly incorporated @xcite .",
    "+ one approach to embed the material symmetry into constitutive modeling is _ reduction by symmetry_. in this approach to hyperelastic constitutive modeling of anisotropic crystals , @xmath0 is expressed as a power series of desired order in components of the strain tensor , and then symmetry constraints are imposed to reduce the number of independent fitting coefficients @xcite .",
    "+ cadelano _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite employed this method to develop a hyperelastic nonlinear constitutive model of monolayer graphene .",
    "the strain energy density function @xmath0 in this model is expressed as a cubic polynomial in components of the green - lagrange strain measure , and hence exhibits a quadratic nonlinearity in the work - conjugate stress - strain relation .",
    "upon reduction by symmetry , the expression for @xmath0 contains three independent third - order elastic constants , and two second - order elastic constants , the values of which were determined by a least - squares fit to the strain energies obtained from tight - binding atomistic simulations for a set of canonical deformations comprising uniaxial stretch along the armchair and the zigzag directions ; an in - plane shear ; and biaxial tension .",

    "their symmetry - reduced expression contained fourteen independent elastic constants , the values of which were determined by fitting model results to dft - calculated stresses corresponding to the same set of deformations used by cadelano _",
    "+ the reduction by symmetry approach suffers from a number of disadvantages : first , the method requires imposing the symmetry constraints extrinsically on components of the elastic constant tensors .",
    "this procedure must be repeated each time a higher - order polynomial nonlinearity is added in the model . since the number of components in a 2d tensor increases with its order @xmath6 as @xmath7 , the task of reduction by symmetry becomes increasingly tedious as the order of the polynomial expansion increases .",
    "secondly , the symmetry restrictions are most readily identified and applied to strain components evaluated in a particular crystallographic frame . from an implementation point of view",
    ", it would be preferable to express @xmath0 in a fashion independent of any particular choice of coordinate axes .",
    "this can best be accomplished if @xmath0 is expressed as a function of a list of invariants of the strain measure , instead of its components .",
    "lastly , and most importantly , the method is _ a priori _ restricted to the use of polynomials in the components of strain as the basis of representation  with no scope for including arbitrary non - polynomial functions in the representation .",

    "in a hyperelastic modeling framework , the strain energy density @xmath0 is formally expressed as a scalar - valued function of deformation gradient @xmath16 .",
    "material frame indifference requires that this function should remain invariant under superimposed rigid body motion ; i.e. , @xmath39 where arbitrary @xmath40 denotes a rigid - body rotation .",
