    "about twenty five years ago the possibility of neutrinos interacting by exchange of very light neutral scalars to produce interesting cosmological and astrophysical effects was considered by kawasaki , murayama and yanagida @xcite , and malaney , starkman and tremaine@xcite .",
    "three of us later investigated a similar system , in which the scalar particle has a mass of order 1/a.u . , which leads to neutrino clustering@xcite .",
    "following the observation of the re - acceleration of the expansion of the universe  @xcite , which led to the concept of dark energy ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "fardon , nelson and weiner  @xcite noted that the inferred energy density of dark energy , of order ( 2.4 mev)@xmath10  @xcite , was , remarkably , of the order of the experimentally inferred value of neutrino masses .",
    "they also utilized the concept of a scalar field interacting with the neutrinos to obtain the desired effect .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that negative pressure is not a strange feature in physics , in that any self bound system has an equilibrium density , and will have a higher energy per particle as the density is decreased , and thus a negative pressure in this region . because this feature exists in our neutrino clustering model , we realized that it could produce negative values of @xmath0 and was thus relevant to the dark energy problem .",
    "we provided some early comments @xcite , and then showed how it led to a system with @xmath3 in a restricted range of the development of the universe  @xcite , with @xmath11 at very early times , and @xmath12 near the present . in this paper",
    "we will be elaborating our model of dark energy .    to obtain the energy density of the neutral fermion ",
    "scalar field system as a function of @xmath2 one needs to make assumptions about parameters .",
    "typically @xmath0 has a minimum as a function of @xmath2 , and the position of the minimum may be moved by a choice of parameters , but a rapid variation of @xmath0 between the minimum and the present is characteristic of our model .",
    "this lends support to attempts to probe the @xmath2 dependence of dark energy in more detail .",
    "it is worth noting that mota et al@xcite have recently introduced the possibility of neutrino clustering in the neutrino  scalar field model to obtain a dependence of the dark energy density on @xmath2 .",
    "our work shows that a variation of @xmath0 and the dark energy density @xmath13 with epoch can be obtained in a homogeneous model .    after outlining the model",
    ", we display our results for @xmath0 as a function of the density of the neutral fermions , and then discuss how to choose the parameters of the model to obtain results for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 , and discuss the implications of the results .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the equation of motion for a neutral fermion field , @xmath14 , interacting with a scalar field , @xmath15 , is @xmath16\\phi & = & g\\overline{\\psi}\\psi \\label{phi}\\\\ \\left[i{/\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\partial } - m_n^{(0)}\\right]\\psi & = & -g \\phi \\psi,\\label{psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath17 .",
    "the nonlinear scalar selfcouplings are omitted here , even though they are required to exist by field theoretic selfconsistency  @xcite , as they may consistently be assumed to be sufficiently weak as to be totally irrelevant .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is the renormalized vacuum mass of the isolated neutral fermion , and takes into account the contributions from the electroweak theory , as well as contributions from the vacuum expectation value of the new scalar field @xmath15 .",
    "we look for solutions of these equations in infinite matter which are static and translationally invariant . in the freidman equation description of the evolution of the universe we use the adiabatic approximation , assuming that the scalar field expectation value takes the value determined by the fermion density at the appropriate time",
    ". equations ( [ phi ] , [ psi ] ) then lead to an effective mass for the neutral fermion of @xmath19 these equations are simply the equations of quantum hadrodynamics @xcite .    as in @xcite , we act with these operator equations on state which is a filled fermi sea of neutral fermions , with a fermion number density @xmath20 and fermi momentum @xmath21 , related , for majorana particles ( which we assume henceforth ) , by @xmath22 .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath23 and the variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : effm ] ) becomes an equation for @xmath28 : @xmath29,\\label{eq : yx}\\ ] ]    the total energy of the system , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the number of fermions , and @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{epf}\\ ] ] as @xmath33 goes from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , @xmath28 varies monotonically from @xmath36 to @xmath34 , behaving as @xmath37 for small @xmath33 , and @xmath38 for large @xmath33 .    for the fermion system to be bound ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath39 must be less than 1 .",
    "we find that for sufficiently large @xmath40 the neutral fermion  scalar field system is bound  @xcite , and the total energy displays the characteristic behaviour of a self - bound system noted above , suggesting that we should see negative pressures in this system .",
    "we now go on to compute the equation of state parameter .",
    "the equation of state , or the equation for the pressure , @xmath41 , as a function of the other variables of the system , is represented through the equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , which is defined by the proportionality between @xmath41 and @xmath13 , the energy density @xmath42 as is well known , for radiation , @xmath43 , for cold non - interacting matter , @xmath44 , and , for a cosmological constant , @xmath45 .",
    "any @xmath46 describes a system with negative pressure .    using the equations of the friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , with a scale parameter @xmath47 , the equation of state parameter",
    "is shown to satisfy @xmath48 in these equations @xmath13 is the _ total _ energy density .",
    "assuming for this paper that the only source of this energy is the coupled fermion - scalar system , then @xmath49 and we obtain @xmath50 this is the basic equation for computing @xmath0 in our model , and it gives @xmath51 it follows immediately that @xmath52 in our model .     vs. log(@xmath33 ) for 8 values of @xmath40.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    from equations ( [ eq : yx],[eq : w ] ) , we can compute @xmath0 as a function of @xmath33 , given @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig : wvslogxf ] shows some results using a log scale for @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath0 approaches close to @xmath1 as the density decreases ( remember the direction of decreasing density is the direction of expansion of the universe ) and then departs sharply towards zero , at large @xmath33 , it is clear that @xmath0 approaches @xmath53 as it should for a relativistic gas of fermions .",
    "the value goes to zero at zero density .    for large values of @xmath40",
    "the minimum value of @xmath0 is very close to @xmath1 and is reached near the value @xmath54 which can be obtained from an analytic approximation . more precisely , and empirically @xmath55 .    . the minimum value of @xmath0 , the point @xmath56 at which this is achieved , and the approximate location @xmath57 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the minimum value of @xmath0 approaches @xmath1 more closely as @xmath40 increases , and the low density recovery of @xmath0 to zero becomes steeper as @xmath40 increases .",
    "it is clear from these results that we have a model in which the value of @xmath0 is a function of the scale parameter @xmath47 or the red - shift @xmath2 , i.e. that we have an epoch dependent dark energy .",
    "but these results are in terms of dimensionless parameters and variables . to connect to the real world we must link these dimensionless numbers to the dimensionful numbers which characterize it . as was shown in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) , there are only a few , weak constraints on the actual parameter values . moreover ,",
    "very large values of @xmath40 are possible even for very small values of @xmath58 if the range of the scalar is very large , corresponding to very small values of @xmath59 . even if long - ranged , such weak interactions between fermions , especially neutrinos or those outside of the standard model altogether ( such as the lsp ) are exceptionally difficult to constrain by any laboratory experiments .",
    "the energy density of dark energy is quoted as @xmath60  @xcite if we define @xmath61 , then @xmath62 mev .",
    "it is important to remember that the conventional value of the dark energy density is derived on the assumption that it is constant during the evolution of the universe , and this is not the case in our model .",
    "pending a study of the development of the universe using our model we use the present estimate of @xmath13 and apply it to the region @xmath63 to estimate the relevant parameters in our model .",
    "@xmath64 to use this equation to estimate @xmath65 , first note that near @xmath3 , for large @xmath40 , @xmath33 is small and we can use the appropriate approximations to get @xmath66 where , in the last equation , we use @xmath67 at the minimum .",
    "@xmath40 determines the relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath68 , @xmath69^{1/4 } m_e$ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath40 , taking care that the implied values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are reasonable . for @xmath70 , @xmath71  mev , in the neutrino range , and for @xmath72 , @xmath73  gev , in the range expected for neutralinos .",
    "what are the implications for the other parameters ?",
    "one can immediately estimate the density of the neutral fermions as @xmath74  @xmath75 and @xmath76  @xmath75 for these two cases .",
    "because we are assuming that the neutral fermions form a homogeneous background , it is appropriate to set the range of the scalar field to be the scale parameter of the universe at the relevant time , which we will take to be @xmath77 , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 with this value of @xmath59 we can obtain the implied value of @xmath79 : @xmath80 and @xmath81 in these two cases .",
    "even the largest coupling is far too weak to be constrained by terrestrial experiments .",
    "an alternative way to proceed would be to assume a present density of the neutral fermions , @xmath82 , and thus a present value of the fermi momentum , @xmath83 , at a scale parameter @xmath84 , use @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "equation ( [ e1 ] ) then gives @xmath87 to give an explicit example , assume that the present density of neutral fermions is 100  @xmath75 , characteristic of neutrinos , and extrapolate this to a density of 800 @xmath75 at @xmath77 .",
    "this gives a value @xmath88ev , and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the even smaller coupling constant , @xmath91 .    at this value of @xmath40 ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath0 is @xmath92 , at the @xmath93 level from the value @xmath94 of the essence supernova survey@xcite , so even these parameters are not excluded .",
    "it is impossible to make further progress without finding additional ways to constrain the parameters . given their extreme values the most promising approach is to use additional theoretical input , which we leave as a challenge for future work , by us and others .",
    "now that we have some parameters we can convert the determination of @xmath0 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath33 to a dependence of @xmath0 on the red shift @xmath2 . to illustrate the results we have selected the values @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath40 , and set the minimum of @xmath0 to occur at @xmath4 .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure [ fig : wvz6 ] .",
    "vs. @xmath2 for @xmath70 , @xmath97 and @xmath98.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    note that there is a slow variation of @xmath0 with @xmath2 at epochs earlier than @xmath99 at which the minimum occurs , but a rapid change for @xmath2 between the present epoch ( @xmath6 ) and that of the minimum .    with the present uncertainty in data we can choose to place",
    "the value of @xmath99 at any value of @xmath2 between , say @xmath100 and @xmath101 without being in conflict with the present data , and have chosen to show the results at @xmath102 as illustrative results .",
    "in an ideal future world one could imagine that @xmath103 is indeed observed to have a minimum value at some @xmath99 , and the the value of @xmath104 , close to but greater than @xmath1 is accurately known .",
    "the fact that the minimum value of @xmath0 is near @xmath1 shows that @xmath105 , and the actual value of @xmath104 , if known accurately enough , would determine the value of @xmath40 . knowing the value of @xmath40 allows us to predict a value of @xmath13 at the minimum @xmath0 , which provides a good test on the model",
    ". then a selection of parameters can place that minimum near an appropriate @xmath2 value , @xmath99 .",
    "our prediction of a characteristic @xmath2 dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath13 leaves us vulnerable to developments in the precision of measurements and the extension of observations to larger and ( with more difficultly ) to smaller @xmath2 , and we await with interest the results of the proposed experiments , such as those described in ref .",
