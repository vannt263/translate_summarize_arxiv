    "recently there have been certain indications from lattice simulations that center - of - group vortices @xcite may be responsible for the area behavior of large wilson loops , i.e. for confinement , see e.  g.   @xcite and references therein . if long closed vortices populate the euclidean vacuum of qcd , resembling curved and entangled spaghetti in italian _ pasta _ , it might serve as a microscopic mechanism of confinement . + from the continuum side , however , vortices invoke more questions than there are answers today .",
    "first of all , there are no finite - size vortex - type solutions of the classical yang  mills equations in a non - compact space , as the classical equations are dimensionless whereas the functional to be minimized is the transverse energy with the dimension @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , if one finds a solution , its dilatation to larger size will have less energy .",
    "this shows that vortex - type solutions of classical equations do not exist @xcite . in a non - compact space",
    "the length scale and hence the vortex radius can be only set by quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore , vortices can at best arise as saddle points of the effective action , with quantum fluctuations about a trial vortex configuration taken into account .",
    "second , if the effective action contains vortex configurations as saddle points , their energy per unit length in @xmath1 or per unit surface in @xmath2 should be either small positive or , even better , slightly negative .",
    "if it is large and positive there is no reason for the vortices to appear in the physical vacuum , in the first place .",
    "third , the typical lengths where vortices bend to an angle of the order of unity must be on the average larger than the characteristic transverse size of the vortex . if it is not so , the fluctuation can be hardly called a vortex .",
    "fourth , different vortices in the vacuum or different segments of the same vortex need to be on the average repulsive so that they do not glue up .",
    "if vortices are permanently merging and splitting it is difficult to consider them as adequate degrees of freedom .",
    "a pilot study of the ` spaghetti vacuum ' in @xmath2 has been performed many years ago by the copenhagen group @xcite who considered a @xmath6 lattice of parallel flux tubes and then presented arguments that the lattice should `` melt '' into a disordered phase . ultimately , one has to build a consistent statistical mechanics of the vortex vacuum in order to see that the ` entangles spaghetti ' have a preferred vacuum free energy as compared to , say , the instanton liquid .",
    "the statistical mechanics of instantons is quite a difficult problem by itself @xcite , but vortices are far more difficult to deal with .",
    "+ in this paper , we address the first and in fact the easiest questions from the above list . for vortices to be physical objects and not artifacts of a regularization and gauge fixing , their typical transverse sizes must be finite in physical units , i.e. to be of the order of @xmath7 in @xmath1 and of the order of @xmath8 in @xmath2 . correspondingly , the energy of a vortex per unit length should be of the order of @xmath9 in @xmath1 , and the energy per unit surface should be of the order of @xmath10 in @xmath2 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath11 implies the transmutation of dimensions through renormalization ; it can be achieved only with quantum fluctuations about the vortex taken into due account .",
    "we study here the effective action with quantum fluctuations about a trial vortex configuration being integrated out , at the one - loop level .",
    "although the one - loop approximation is not the whole story , it is the first attempt to find out if there are any hints from the continuum yang  mills theory that isolated ` thick ' vortices have the right to exist .",
    "we seem to get a positive answer to this question .",
    "it seems that quantized - flux vortices are dynamically preferred compared with the perturbative vacuum .",
    "+ in what follows , we consider an idealized isolated infinitely long and straight vortex perpendicular to the @xmath12 plane .",
    "we choose an ansatz for the vortex profile in the transverse plane @xmath13 and expand the ym action into the classical part , @xmath14 , and the part quadratic in the fluctuations @xmath15 about the background @xmath16 .",
    "integration over @xmath15 ( and over ghost fields stemming from background gauge fixing ) is non - trivial , as the mere counting of levels as compared to the free case is not obvious for the quantized - flux vortices ; the difficulty is related to the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect .",
    "we perform this integration by extending the jost scattering theory ( which ` counts ' the levels properly ) to the two - dimensional case : it results in the quantum part of the effective action being finite after renormalization .",
    "the full effective action is the sum of the classical and quantum parts .",
    "in fact , we study several functional forms of the profile and find that in each case there exists a minimum of the action with respect to the transverse spread of the vortex .",
    "it turns out to be about @xmath17 in @xmath1 and about @xmath18 in @xmath2 .",
    "the values of the effective action at the minima are _ negative _ in all cases considered .",
    "it indicates that the yang  mills vacuum might be unstable in regard to the spontaneous production of vortices .",
    "+ this work has certain overlap with the earlier study by the copenhagen group @xcite who started from the observation by savvidy @xcite that already a constant chromomagnetic field lowers the yang  mills vacuum energy .",
    "the savvidy vacuum has , however , a negative fluctuation mode leading to instability .",
    "the copenhagen group has included the amplitude of the negative mode ( interpreted as a higgs field but actually part of the gauge field ) into the minimization procedure and indicated that the @xmath6 hexagonal lattice of tubes with quantized flux leads to a further lowering of vacuum energy .",
    "however neither the fluctuations in the unstable mode nor in the higher modes were included .",
    "in contrast , we take into full account all quantum fluctuations about a _",
    "single _ trial vortex .",
    "the full one - loop quantum calculation performed here shows that already isolated center vortices in su(2 ) and also their embedding in su(3 ) are energetically preferred compared with the perturbative vacuum .",
    "this result comes both in @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( the latter case has not been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ) giving thus certain support to the disordered - vortices scenario of confinement in both cases .",
    "by definition of a @xmath19 vortex , the wilson loop in the fundamental representation of the @xmath20 gauge group , winding around the vortex in the transverse plane assumes values being nontrivial elements of the group center , as the radius of the wilson loop tends to @xmath21 :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 . in this paper",
