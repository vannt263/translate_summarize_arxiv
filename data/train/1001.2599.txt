    "the object catalogued as sdss j123813.73 - 033933.0 ( hereafter sdss1238 ) was identified with a faint ( @xmath2 mag ) short - period cataclysmic variable ( cv ) by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of sdss1238   shows a blue continuum with broad absorption features originating in the photosphere of a white dwarf surrounding double - peaked balmer emission lines , formed in a high inclination accretion disk .",
    "the orbital period of the system is @xmath3 , based on spectroscopic data . the orbital period and the spectral features match those of wz - sge - type systems , but with this",
    ", similarities practically end .",
    "a number of observed aspects of the system differ from the majority of short period cvs .",
    "the most intriguing characteristic , which we found in this system , is a sudden and fast rise in brightness up to @xmath4 mag during a short time , of about half of the orbital period . after reaching its peak , the brightness slowly decreases , lasting @xmath5 hours , down to the quiescence level .",
    "we call these events _ brightenings _  in order to distinguish them from the more common outbursts , humps , flickering and other types of variability documented in short period cvs",
    ". these _ brightenings _   seemed to happen cyclically about every 8 - 12hours .",
    "in addition to _ brightenings _ , a nearly permanent sinusoidal variability was detected in the light curve of sdss1238   with a period half that of the spectroscopic orbital period @xmath6 ( hereafter , the double - humped light curve ) .",
    "the amplitude of the double - hump variability depends on the phase of the _ brightenings_. it increases with a total rise in brightness of up to @xmath7 mag and decreases until almost disappears during the quiescence .",
    "a similar behavior was found later by @xcite in another short period cv , sdssj080434.20 + 510349.2 ( hereafter sdss0804 ) which has an identical spectral appearance to sdss1238   in quiescence . advanced the hypothesis that the double - humped light curve is a signature of 2:1 resonance in the accretion disks of these systems . in order for the accretion disk to reach permanently the 2:1 resonance radius",
    ", the mass ratio of the binary component must be extreme ( @xmath8 ) , and as such these objects could qualify as bounce - back systems , e.g. cvs , which are old enough to reach the period minimum and leap toward slightly longer orbital periods , as predicted by @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that accretion disks of wz sge systems reach 2:1 resonance radius during super - outburst , when some of them have been noted to show double - humped light curves @xcite .",
    "the super - outbursts of wz sge type systems are infrequent and happen every two dozen or more years .",
    "oddly enough , sdss0804 went into the super - outburst in 2006 @xcite and exhibited all necessary attributes of a classical wz sge - type object . regrettably , the _ brightenings _  disappeared from the light curves of sdss0804 after the super - outburst , although the double - hump light curve persists .",
    "thus , the sdss1238  remains the only object that still shows _",
    "brightenings_. intrigued by the new photometric phenomenon observed in these two systems , we conducted a new time - resolved photometric study of sdss1238   to establish the reasons behind their common nature , understand the origin of the cyclic _ brightenings _   and its relation to the amplitude of the double - humped light curve .",
    "meanwhile , we discovered that sdss1238  was marginally detected as an infrared source by 2mass survey , and secured accurate near - ir photometry of the object . in sect.2",
    "we describe our observations and data reductions .",
    "the data analyses and the results are presented in sects.3,4,5 , while a general discussion and conclusions are given in sect.6 .",
    "the object is listed in the 2mass point source catalogue with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 magnitudes .",
    "these magnitudes are close to the detection limits of 2mass , particularly in the @xmath12-band . in order have more accurate photometry , we obtained new observations of sdssj123813.73 - 033933.0 in @xmath13 on 17 june 2009 with the near - infrared camera panic ( martini et al .",
    "2004 ) attached to the 6.5 m baade / magellan telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "panic provides an image scale of 0.125@xmath14 pixel@xmath15 on a hawaii hgcdte @xmath16 array detector .",
    "the fwhm of the point - spread function was between @xmath17 and @xmath18 during our observations .",
    "for each filter , 9 dithered frames spaced by @xmath19 were taken , with total on - source integration times of 540  s in each of the three filters .",
    "the nine frames were shifted and averaged to produce the final images .",
    "standard sky - subtraction and flat - field correction procedures were applied .",
    "aperture ( @xmath20 ) photometry was performed with daophot within iraf in the standard way .",
    "flux calibration was performed using standard stars sj  9146 and sj  9157 from the list of @xcite and the total errors are estimated to be less than 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "the resulting magnitudes of sdss1238  are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and corresponding colors @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in order to investigate whether flux variations in the near - ir occur in this system in timescales of a few minutes , we measured the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 fluxes from each of the nine short - exposure ( 60  s ) frames in each filter . in the @xmath30min that lasted each series , we did not detect any variability within the @xmath31 mag photometric uncertainty associated with each single frame .",
    "note , that in longer timescales ( comparable to the orbital period ) , the system is expected to show some variability in the near - ir , mostly due to the elliptical shape of roche - lobe filling secondary , but these could be missed in a 15 min time series .",
    "the ellipsoidal variability of the secondary can be calculated and it has been taken into account in further considerations of ir magnitudes .    the objective of our optical photometry of sdss1238  was to study of phenomenon of _",
    "brightenings_. taking into account the long duration of the _ brightenings _   and the uncertainty of the cycle period , we planned and executed a multi - longitude observational campaign of this object .",
    "time - resolved ccd photometry was obtained at several facilities : the 1.5 m telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir in mexico ; the 0.8 m iac80 telescope at the observatorio del teide in the canary islands , spain ; the 2.1 m telescope at the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in south korea ; the 2 m telescope at the terskol astrophysical observatory in the northern caucasus , russia , the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope of the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle , india .",
    "the data reduction was performed using both eso - midas and iraf software .",
    "the images were bias - corrected and flat - fielded before aperture photometry was carried out .",
    "the log of photometric observations is presented in table.1 .",
    "the long - slit observations have been obtained with the boller & chivens spectrograph on the 2.1-m telescope at the spm site with a resolution of 3.03   pixel@xmath15 . the spectra span the wavelength range 4000 - 7100  .   in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we obtained a series of phase - locked spectra : 10 spectra were taken at equal phase intervals over a single orbital period @xmath32min with an exposure time of 486 sec per spectrum .",
    "this sequence of spectra was repeated at exactly the same phase intervals for subsequent periods and subsequent nights .",
    "this allows us to calculate the phase - averaged spectra , summarizing the spectra of the same orbital phase obtained during one night and the whole set of observations without further decreasing the time resolution .",
    "the log of spectroscopic observations is presented in table.2 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object in the range of 4000 - 25000  is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the detailed description of the sdss1238  optical spectrum was given in our previous paper .",
    "the overall appearance of the spectrum has not changed , but we detect a significant variability of the equivalent widths of balmer emission lines from epoch to epoch .",
    "the balmer lines are about two times weaker in the 2009 observations compared to the 2004 spectra ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the continuum , however , has not changed during the last five years , as we compare v - band magnitudes in quiescence between _ brightenings_. the average quiescence magnitude between _ brightenings _   remains constant at around @xmath33 .",
    "the present near - ir measurements demonstrated that there is significant ir excess emission to that expected from the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail of the optical spectrum for a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "in fact , neither a wd nor a power - law flux from the accretion disk , nor their combination , can explain the observed ir excess .",
    "the most probable source of ir excess is the radiation from the secondary star . to determine the spectral type of the secondary and the distance to the system we fitted the observed optical - infrared spectral energy distribution of the object with a simple model : the total flux @xmath34 is the sum of contributions from a wd with a hydrogen atmosphere , @xmath35 ( da type wds ) , an accretion disk with @xmath36 @xcite , and a red / brown dwarf with @xmath37 : @xmath38 brown dwarf fluxes were taken from the literature @xcite and on - line sources",
    "the white dwarf spectra with a mass range of m@xmath39m@xmath40 were used with a 0.1m@xmath40 step and the radii were calculated using the white dwarf radius - mass relation of @xmath41 from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectra of wds in the 4000 - 25000   range with pure hydrogen atmosphere were obtained using atlas9 @xcite and synth @xcite codes for an appropriate range of temperatures .",
    "although our previous temperature estimate was @xmath42k based on fits to the absorption portion of balmer lines , in the present fitting procedure we allowed a wider temperature range from @xmath4311000 to 18000k , because of the larger number of free parameters .",
    "the calculations were performed with a 1000k step and with the surface gravity @xmath44 .",
    "the spectra are normalized to @xmath45 and the contribution of the wd is @xmath46 where @xmath47 , v = 17.8 is the object s magnitude in quiescence , and @xmath48 is a parameter , determining the contribution of the flux from the wd in the v band .",
    "finally , the @xmath49 - is the constant to convert magnitudes into flux ( in @xmath50 ) in the v band .",
    "the spectra of the accretion disk was assumed to be a simple power law @xmath51 where @xmath52 determines the contribution from the accretion disk in the v band , assuming that the wd and the accretion disk are the only contributors in that wavelength as the only other contributor is the brown dwarf , which has a negligible flux in v.    the distance to the object is estimated to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the black body flux at @xmath55 with effective temperature @xmath56 .",
    "observed seds of red / brown dwarfs of spectral types between m6 to l5 normalized to fit the observed flux in j were used .",
    "the bolometric correction to the j magnitude for each spectral type was taken from @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the three - component model are : the white dwarf effective temperature , @xmath56 , the mass of the white dwarf , @xmath57 , the spectral type of the secondary star , spt , and the parameter @xmath48 ( in magnitudes ) .",
    "the best fit model to the observed sdss1238 spectrum in the 0.4 - 2.5@xmath58 m range achieved for the following set of parameters ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) is : @xmath59 , spt = l4 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the deduced distance to the object is 110pc .",
    "we studied the behavior of @xmath62 vs a single fit parameter , when the other three are fixed to their corresponding best values .",
    "fig.[fig:3 ] presents @xmath62 plots for various parameters with marked confidence levels corresponding to 95 , 80 and 60% .",
    "we can state that @xmath62 tends to the minimum value always , when @xmath63k and @xmath64  @xmath65 regardless of the value of the other parameters . at the same time",
    ", there is a dependence between the mass of the wd and the spectral type of the secondary : the lower the mass , the larger the radius of wd , and thus , the larger the distance to the system , resulting in an earlier spectral type of the secondary .",
    "the best fit to the optical part of the spectrum is reached with the mass of the wd of @xmath66 , leading to the cited distance of , 110pc , and spectral type of the secondary , l4 . the entire range of secondary from @xmath67 at @xmath68 and @xmath69pc to @xmath70 at @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72pc was considered .",
    "however , a pronounced minimum in @xmath62 for rather massive wd strongly suggests the presence of brown dwarf in this system .",
    "the indication of a massive wd is not accidental , a cv with a brown dwarf secondary , supposed to have evolved beyond minimum orbital period limit , has an age @xmath73 years and a long history of accretion . a priori ,",
    "the bounce - back cvs are assumed to harbor a massive wd , although the distribution of known masses of all wds in eclipsing systems does not show any trend @xcite .",
    "but when considering only the short - period end of that distribution as @xcite did , then it becomes apparent that evolved systems systematically have more massive wds .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of the secondary is @xmath74 for @xmath75 or @xmath76 for @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "but it is also a well known fact that the secondaries of cvs tend to show systematically an earlier spectral class and a larger radius with secondaries of lower mass than the corresponding single stars on the main sequence @xcite .",
    "so we expect that the mass of the secondary in sdss1238  hovers around the lower edge of the above mentioned range of masses .",
    "note , that due the high galactic latitude of this object ( @xmath78 ) and the inferred small distance , the interstellar extinction is negligible .",
    "we also would like to emphasize that in the above calculations we took into account the fact that the state of the system was unknown at the moment of acquiring the ir data .",
    "therefore , we conducted the fitting for both cases , considering that the system might have been at the maximum of the _ brightenings _   during the ir observations or at the bottom . that introduced only a minor change , basically decreasing the distance to the system by @xmath30pc and not affecting our conclusions regarding the spectral type of the secondary .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the discrepancy in the temperature determination of the wd , which is larger than we would like as compared to that of . in the latter the temperature and gravity",
    "could not be determined simultaneously , and one parameter had to be fixed in order to calculate the other , which always introduces ambiguity , as none of these two parameters could be estimated independently . in this paper",
    "we take a more complex approach : not only profiles of the lines are being fitted , but the continuum is taken into consideration as well . also , the presence of the secondary , adding additional restraints on the distance and thus , on the size of the wd .",
    "the sed of the accretion disk , which may not necessarily obey the canonical power law index is the source of the largest uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "since the contribution of the disk is limited to only @xmath79 % , so is the accuracy of our estimates . with all that in mind",
    ", we still end up with a range of spectral classes for the secondary that implies that sdss1238   is a bounce - back system .",
    "the h@xmath80 emission line originating in the accretion disk is the least affected by the absorption from the underlying white dwarf .",
    "therefore , we constructed doppler maps @xcite of h@xmath80 using all our data obtained in 2004 and 2009 ( fig.[fig : dop ] , top ) .",
    "the individual maps of separate nights resemble each other so much , that combining all available data did not smooth out details , but made them much more convincing . in order to over - plot contours of the secondary star , the location of the wd , the trajectory of the stream and resonance radius of the disk",
    ", we used the best fit parameters to the sed ( see previous section ) .",
    "thus , the white dwarf mass of @xmath81 was adopted . due to the ambiguity in determining precise masses of brown dwarfs",
    ", we adopted a mass ratio of @xmath82 .",
    "this value is typical for systems considered as bounce - back @xcite and it is the same mass ratio which was obtained for sdss0804 , a twin of sdss1238 , from the super - hump period observed during the super - outburst in 2006 . before sdss0804 underwent a wz - sge type super - outburst , it showed similar peculiar photometric variability to sdss1238 .",
    "in addition , it shares every other characteristic of a wz sge - type object , and was also proposed as a candidate to the bounce back system .",
    "as already noted , the structure of the accretion disk did not change between the two epochs of our observations .",
    "there is a bright spot at the expected place where the stream of matter from the secondary collides with the accretion disk , but it overlaps with a much larger and prolonged structure , too extended to be a part of the spot .",
    "another extended bright region of similar size can be seen at velocity coordinates ( @xmath83 km s@xmath15 , @xmath84  km  s@xmath15 ) as well as a less bright structure at ( @xmath85 km s@xmath15 , @xmath86 km s@xmath15 ) .",
    "similar doppler maps were obtained for wz sge during super - outburst in 2001 and in quiescence for bounce back candidates sdss1035 @xcite and sdss0804 @xcite .",
    "such brightness distribution in the doppler map can be interpreted as evidence of spiral waves in the disk ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the formation of a spiral structure in an accretion disk of a close binary system was predicted by @xcite and explored by various authors ( and reference therein ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated from high resolution numerical calculations that spirals will always formed in accretion disks under tidal forces from the secondary .",
    "they actually used @xmath87 in their models , but observationally , such spirals were detected in a number of systems only during outbursts of dwarf novae .",
    "the careful examination of quiescent disks of the same systems did not reveal any spiral structures in longer period dne .",
    "@xcite argued that little evidence of spiral arms in the emission lines is expected in systems with low values of viscosity .",
    "on the other hand , spiral arms related to 2:1 resonance can be found in systems with extremely low mass ratio @xmath88 as originally was predicted by @xcite .",
    "the bounce - back systems and related to them , wzsge stars , are examples of such objects . the long outburst recurrence time in wzsge systems",
    "is probably explained by a very low viscosity in their accretion disks , yet spiral arms can be observed permanently in quiescent bounce - back systems in which , on one side there is a massive wd , which gained mass during a long accretion history , and on another side there is a late - type brown dwarf , providing a mass ratio of @xmath89 .",
    "fig.[fig : dop ] ( bottom , left ) depicts a synthetic doppler map constructed from a model accretion disk that is shown on the bottom right panel .",
    "the latter was calculated with the binary system parameters derived above by using smooth particle hydrodynamics according to @xcite .",
    "the artificial doppler map reproduces the observed map in a case when there is a brightness excess within spiral arms .",
    "most of the disk particles are on periodic orbits , which are most favorable from the point - of - view of viscosity .",
    "however , the resonance dispatches some particles onto aperiodic orbits creating viscosity perturbations , which will create excess of heat .",
    "a slightly different interpretation of spiral arm brightness is offered by @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is not very well established , but it is natural to assume that in these regions there will be excess emission .",
    "figure [ fig : phot ] displays the light curve of sdss1238 obtained in 2007 . in general , the object shows an identical behavior to previous years , as described by .",
    "there are two distinct types of variability : a long - term variability ( ltv ) , lasting more than 8h , and a short - term variability with a period corresponding to half the orbital period . follow - up observations during 2008 and 2009 confirm a steady presence of both types of variability in the light curve ( fig.[fig : photnew ] ) .",
    "continuous observations during about 15 hours obtained on 22/03/2007 ( hjd 2454182.15 - 2544182.60 , fig.[fig : phocont ] ) allowed us to observe two consecutive _ brightenings _ and , thus to determine their recurrence time directly ( @xmath90h ) . demonstrated that _",
    "brightenings _  occurred cyclically with periods in between 8 and 12 hours , however it was not possible to establish if the phenomenon was strictly periodic or not .",
    "armed with more data , and the advantage of detecting consecutive events by employing multi - longitude observations , we performed a simple period search .",
    "the period analysis of all data obtained during 2007 , based on a discrete fourier transform method , results in a strong peak at a frequency @xmath91 day@xmath15 with fwhm of 0.1 .",
    "this conforms with the period of @xmath920.36h @xmath93 ( fig.[fig : ltv1 ] ) .",
    "however , the data folded with this period looks messy because , apparently , some re - brightenings happen with a different cycle period .",
    "it shows that the large uncertainty in the period value is not just a result of a scarce amount of data , or its uneven distribution , but that the _ brightenings _  are not strictly periodic in long timescales .",
    "the peak @xmath94  day@xmath15 , corresponding to the half of the orbital period , @xmath95 min , is also present in the power spectrum .",
    "there are some additional peaks which are one - day aliases or a combination of high harmonics of @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "we have repeated the same analysis for the data obtained only within hjd 2454177.1 - 2544185.6 , when we observed the object with small observational gaps .",
    "the result of the analysis of periodicity for this selection is presented in fig.[fig : ltv2 ] .",
    "the strongest peak in the power spectrum appears at a frequency corresponding to @xmath98h .",
    "the light curve folded with this period is coherent during the considered time ( fig.[fig : ltv2 ] ) , i.e macro - profile of the _ brightenings _   ( the rise , the peak , the declining slope and minimum duration ) repeats itself with high accuracy and , if not for the high - frequency modulation also present in the light curve , the folded curves would concur .",
    "combining the entire available data obtained during the 2004  2009 observational runs does not permit a determination of a single period with which the entire data set can be folded . clearly , the ltv modulation is not strictly periodic , but probably maintains coherence in a time scale of several weeks and certainly has a cyclic nature .    the long - term variability ( _ the brightenings _ ) presents a fast rise in the object brightness of up to 0.4 - 0.6 mag , lasting about half the orbital period ( @xmath99h ) with the brightness falling back to the quiescence level during the next 4.4 - 4.6h ( fig . [",
    "fig : phocont ] ) .",
    "after that , the object remains in quiescence during about another 4 hours .",
    "the brightness increases at a rate of @xmath100 mag / h , and the falling rate is about @xmath101 mag / h .",
    "sometimes , the rise in the brightness happens more slowly and lasts until almost one full orbital period ( fig.[fig : phot ] nights : 156 , 179 ) .",
    "a short - term variability is clearly present during _",
    "the brightenings_. the amplitude of the short - term variability depends strongly on the phase of _ brightenings_. the amplitude is larger then the total brightness increases and falls , sometimes practically disappearing , between the _ brightenings _   ( figs .",
    "[ fig : phot ] , [ fig : photnew ] , [ fig : phocont ] )",
    ". curiously , when the ltv is coherent , the signal at double orbital frequency decreases and a beat frequency between the ltv and @xmath97 becomes dominant in the range of frequencies around 36 cycles / day .",
    "removing ltv has little effect , because this does affect the frequency modulation but not the amplitude modulation .",
    "the strong relation between ltv cycle coherence and the strength of @xmath97 modulation attests that these two phenomena are physically linked in more than a simple amplitude correlation .",
    "we suspect that the _ brightenings _   and formation of spiral arms in the disk are the result of the same process , but its cyclic nature remains unclear .",
    "in recent years , a number of objects were discovered , mostly thanks to the sloan digital sky survey , which can be characterized as wz sge type cvs in quiescence , judging by their @xmath102 min periods , spectral appearance and lack of su uma style outburst activity . currently , there are about 20 objects with similar characteristics which were selected from the sdss lists .",
    "three such objects are gw lib , v455 and and sdss0804 , which underwent a typical wzsge type super - outburst in 2006 - 2007 , confirming the correct assessment of their nature from their behavior in quiescence . but unlike classical wz sge stars , some of them differ by the presence of permanent double - humps per orbital period in the light curve .",
    "the significance of the double - humped light curve lies in the assumption that it is produced by the spiral structure in the accretion disk .",
    "the spiral arms in accretion disks have been detected before by means of doppler tomography in long period systems only during dn outburst .",
    "we are not aware of any reports of double - humped light curves during these detections .",
    "double - humped light curves have previously came to attention , as they were detected during super - outbursts of wz sge .",
    "it was soon suggested that they are result of 2:1 resonance , as one of the possibilities .",
    "also spirals arms are formed in the accretion disk of the wz sge undergoing super - outburst @xcite , because , according to our hypothesis wz sge accretion disk reaches the resonance radius only during super - outburst .",
    "nevertheless , the spiral structure has been observed persistently along with the double - humped light curve in two similar short - period systems , sdss0804 and sdss1238 in quiescence .",
    "we assume that the spiral structure formed in low viscosity , quiescent disks is a result of distortion of the disk by the 2:1 resonance .",
    "the 2:1 resonance may happen only in the accretion disk of a system with extreme mass ratio of @xmath103 .",
    "such mass ratio is achieved only in systems known as bounce - backed or , in other words , systems which have reached a minimum period of @xmath104 min and have turned to slightly longer periods according to @xcite .",
    "it is expected that bounce - back systems are numerous @xcite , but until recently very few candidates have been found .",
    "the sdss helped to uncover a large number of new cvs , with new interesting features @xcite . among them , there is a number of short period systems , some of which turned out to belong to the long - sought bounce - back systems @xcite .",
    "we have unveiled a brown dwarf secondary in sdss1238 , probably as late as l4 , thus providing strong evidence that this object is a real bounce - back system .",
    "we also estimated parameters of the wd .",
    "the best fit to the sed converges if the primary is a massive @xmath105 white dwarf with a @xmath106k temperature .",
    "both numbers seem plausible since the system is very old and the wd is expected to be relatively massive and cool .",
    "these findings provide further support to our claim that by simply observing a permanent double humped light curves one can identify an evolved , bounce - back systems instead of using other complicated methods .",
    "it is important to note that sdss1238  has another peculiarity , which termed as _",
    "brightenings_. there was only one other system known to exhibit _ brightenings _ , namely sdss0804 , but since it underwent a super - outburst in 2006 , its photometric behavior has drastically changed .",
    "the _ brightenings _  shortly detected by @xcite in sdss0804 before the super - outburst have been replaced by : a ) _ the mini - outburst _ activity with permanent presence of the double - humped light curve of constant amplitude and by : b ) a 12.6 min period , probably corresponding to pulsation activity of the wd @xcite .",
    "therefore , at present , sdss1238  is the only object known to show _ brightenings_. it greatly complicates the study of this phenomenon .",
    "based on new multi - longitude continuous monitoring , we demonstrated here that the _ brightenings _  are of cyclic nature with a recurrence time of @xmath107 hours and they are probably coherent over several cycles . there seem to be strong correlation between _ brightenings _   cycles and the amplitude of double - hump periodic variability .",
    "this is believed to be the result of spiral arms in the accretion disk of bounce - back systems with an extreme mass ratio , in which accretion disk extends beyond a 2:1 resonance radius .",
    "the tomogram of a simulated accretion disk in the regime of resonance , closely resembles the observed one and supports this hypothesis .",
    "the formation of a spiral structure in the disk can be accounted by the appearance of double humps in the light curve , but it can not be the reason of increased brightness of the disk .",
    "the disk brightness directly depends on the mass transfer rate and its change should probably reflect change in mass transfer .",
    "no readily explanation is available as to why that rate can be variable and cyclical , but possible speculations include counteraction : a ) to the heating of the secondary by _ brightenings _ , or b ) to tidal interaction between the secondary with the resonance attaining accretion disk .",
