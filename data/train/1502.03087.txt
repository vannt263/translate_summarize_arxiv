    "it is an undeniable fact of nature that the world as we know it is non - supersymmetric .",
    "supersymmetry is nowhere to be found amongst the elementary particles or their fundamental interactions  it has certainly not appeared at presently accessible energy scales ( including those probed at the first run of the lhc ) , nor are there currently any signs of its imminent appearance at higher energies . while many continue to feel that a discovery of supersymmetry is more likely than not , there is increasing room for skepticism",
    " especially as current data already imply that supersymmetry would no longer be capable of serving its primary theoretical function of providing , in and of itself , a complete solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "indeed , the recent discovery of the higgs makes the issue of stabilizing the gauge hierarchy all the more pressing .    given the observational absence of supersymmetry , model - builders face a stark choice .",
    "one possibility is to assume that nature is fundamentally supersymmetric and then to determine how this supersymmetry might be broken in order to yield the non - supersymmetric world we observe .",
    "the second is to imagine that nature is , by contrast , non - supersymmetric at _ all _  levels , and then to proceed entirely along non - supersymmetric lines .",
    "this distinction is especially marked in the case of string theory because non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric theories are radically different , even when they might seem to be closely related .",
    "for most of the modern history of string theory , it is the first option which has received the greatest attention . as a result",
    ", string phenomenology has largely consisted of constructing realistic or semi - realistic string models with @xmath0 supersymmetry  where `` realistic '' is usually taken to mean that the string spectrum bears a resemblance to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  and then calling upon some field - theoretic susy - breaking mechanism ( such as gaugino condensation ) to break the @xmath0 susy .",
    "however the second option , that of constructing entirely non - supersymmetric string models whose low - energy limits correspond directly to the standard model , has received relatively little attention . it is the purpose of this paper to stimulate a dedicated and systematic exploration of this second path .",
    "it is important to understand that in string theory , the distinction between these two possibilities is _ not _ a question of the _ energy scale _ at which supersymmetry is broken , with the first path corresponding to a relatively low susy - breaking scale and the second corresponding to one at the planck scale .",
    "rather , the question is whether _ the string model itself _ , at its own fundamental energy scale , is supersymmetric or not .",
    "for example , as we shall see , it is possible to build string models in which the massless states resemble the standard model and in which their erstwhile superpartners have masses that can be dialed to literally any value  even tev - scale values ! however these are still _ non - supersymmetric _ string models , and it would be wrong to view such string models as having been supersymmetric at high energy scales but subsequently subjected to some sort of susy - breaking mechanism at lower energies .",
    "this last point is critical , and may require additional clarification .",
    "it is common to speak of the various steps taken in the _ construction _ of a given string model as if they occurred in an actual time - ordered or energy - ordered sequence . within such heuristic language",
    ", one might then refer to a `` susy - breaking '' step in the construction .",
    "for example , one mechanism that we shall discuss extensively in this paper is `` scherk - schwarz '' compactification , and one often refers to this as a `` scherk - schwarz '' breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "while we shall even use this terminology ourselves throughout this paper , we wish to be completely clear that this is not a breaking of supersymmetry according to any time - ordered or energy - ordered dynamics . indeed",
    ", more proper language would simply indicate that there exists a well - defined set of procedures that enable us to produce one self - consistent string model from another .",
    "moreover , under certain circumstances , such procedures may produce a non - supersymmetric string model from a supersymmetric one .",
    "however , the resulting non - supersymmetric string model is no less fundamental than the original : both sit independently within the landscape of possible string models as potential independent descriptions of physics at all energy scales .",
    "our interest in this paper concerns the methods by which suitable non - supersymmetric strings might be constructed , and the low - energy phenomenologies to which they give rise .",
    "we are certainly not the first to focus on such non - supersymmetric strings and their phenomenologies .",
    "indeed , over the past thirty years , despite the torrent of work focusing on supersymmetric string model - building , there has nevertheless also been a steady trickle of work focusing on the properties of _ non - supersymmetric _ strings .",
    "for example , ever since the construction of the first known example of a non - supersymmetric string theory without tree - level tachyons  the original ten - dimensional @xmath1 heterotic string  @xcite  there has also been a steady line of work studying the diverse properties of such strings .",
    "this includes studies of their one - loop cosmological constants  @xcite , their finiteness properties  @xcite , and their strong / weak coupling duality symmetries  @xcite .",
    "there have even been studies of the landscapes of such strings  @xcite , and of course all studies of strings at finite temperature are also implicitly studies of such non - supersymmetric strings  ( for early work in this area , see , , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in general , the non - supersymmetric string models which were studied were either non - supersymmetric by construction or exhibited a form of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , achieved through a stringy version of the scherk - schwarz mechanism  @xcite  indeed , potentially viable models within this class were constructed in refs .",
    "moreover , although our main focus in this paper concerns weakly coupled heterotic strings , non - supersymmetric string models have also been explored in a wide variety of other configurations  @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect of scherk - schwarz breaking in the brane context is that the sizes of large extra dimensions can also play the role of order parameters for supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this leads to interesting relations between scales in various schemes  @xcite .    despite this body of work ,",
    "however , the possibility of developing a genuinely non - supersymmetric string phenomenology for the weakly coupled heterotic string has not attracted the attention it deserves .",
    "undoubtedly the major stumbling block has been the question of stability . as we shall discuss in sect .",
    "ii , non - supersymmetric strings generally give rise to non - zero tadpole diagrams .",
    "the existence of such tadpole diagrams is problematic , indicating that such strings are generally formulated on unstable vacua . in principle",
    ", one can absorb dilaton tadpoles via the fischler - susskind mechanism  @xcite , as in refs .",
    "however , if such tadpoles are unsuppressed , the new background produced is expected to be very different from the initial one , thereby invalidating the original construction .",
    "thus , in any complete discussion of non - supersymmetric string phenomenology , the question of overcoming the instabilities associated with the dilaton tadpoles will be central .    in this paper",
    ", we show that it is possible to overcome this hurdle and build non - supersymmetric heterotic string models which are essentially stable  , to build heterotic string models for which the degree of instability associated with the dilaton tadpole is exponentially suppressed compared with what might otherwise be expected .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate through explicit construction that such models can at the same time also exhibit semi - realistic phenomenological properties , such as a particle content resembling that of the standard model or a pati - salam - type extension thereof .",
    "indeed , no light superpartners are predicted for many of the standard - model particles .",
    "thus , we shall see that it is possible to suppress the dilaton tadpole ( and thereby suppress the resulting non - supersymmetric instabilities ) while simultaneously retaining a promising low - energy phenomenology  all without any remnant of supersymmetry in the corresponding string spectrum .",
    "of course , we are not claiming that such string models are completely satisfactory as bona - fide models of the universe , or even as phenomenologically acceptable string vacua .",
    "for example , just as with typical _ supersymmetric _ string models , these non - supersymmetric heterotic string models generally contain many unfixed moduli whose vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) ultimately remain to be determined .",
    "our point , however , is that these non - supersymmetric models are just as viable as the supersymmetric ones , in the sense that the primary _ extra _ instabilities which arise due to the absence of spacetime supersymmetry have been exponentially suppressed .",
    "this places such non - supersymmetric string models on an essentially equal footing with their more traditional supersymmetric counterparts , and thereby opens the door to a study of the phenomenology of _",
    "non_-supersymmetric heterotic strings which mirrors that developed over the past thirty years for their supersymmetric cousins .",
    "this paper is organized in three main parts .",
    "the first part , consisting of sects .",
    "ii through iv , lays the groundwork for our study in a way which is completely general and independent of any particular model - construction formalism . in sect .",
    "ii we begin by discussing the finiteness and stability properties of non - supersymmetric heterotic strings , while in sect .",
    "iii we focus on the so - called _ interpolating models _ and explain why these strings are particularly relevant for questions of stability . in sect .",
    "iv , we then discuss the one - loop cosmological constants associated with such strings . in so doing",
    ", we focus on their leading and subleading behaviors , paying particular attention to the role played by off - shell string states and the contributions they provide .",
    "these cosmological constants are important for such strings because they determine the sizes of the dilaton tadpoles that are ultimately responsible for their instability .",
    "the stage having thus been set , the second part of this paper focuses on the actual construction of semi - realistic non - supersymmetric heterotic string models with suppressed cosmological constants .",
    "this is done in several steps , for which a roadmap is provided in sect .",
    "v.a .   first , in sect .",
    "v , we introduce a particular six - dimensional free - fermionic string model from which our ultimate four - dimensional string models emerge upon compactification . then , in sect .",
    "vi , we consider two different types of compactification for this model  one a traditional susy - preserving @xmath2 orbifold compactification and the other a susy - breaking coordinate - dependent compactification ( cdc )  and analyze the four - dimensional models that result . finally , in sect .",
    "vii , we show how the latter of these four - dimensional string models can be altered in different ways in order to achieve our desired goal , namely models with exponentially suppressed dilaton - tadpole instabilities .",
    "indeed , we present several models of this type , one whose low - energy spectrum resembles the standard model , and others resembling either pati - salam - like or gut - like `` unified '' extensions thereof .    the third and final part of this paper then begins an exploration of the properties of these models . in sect .",
    "viii we study two theoretical properties of these models : the behavior of the degeneracies associated with their physical - state spectra as functions of energy , and the behavior of their cosmological constants as functions of their compactification radii . in each case , we find special features which are unique and which reflect the fact that these models exhibit enhanced stability properties relative to typical non - supersymmetric string models .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "ix , we begin a study of their phenomenological properties , focusing on particle assignments , yukawa couplings , and scalar masses . finally , in sect .",
    "x , we discuss the different possibilities for the overall energy scales that can be associated with such models .",
    "xi contains our conclusions and outlines some avenues for further study .",
    "this paper also contains four appendices .",
    "the first three respectively describe our notation and conventions ; the formalism for analyzing the spectra of fermionic strings ; and our proof of a claim concerning the generation of tachyons in models with supersymmetry broken by discrete torsion .",
    "the final appendix then summarizes the explicit definitions of our models in sect .",
    "this paper focuses on perturbative non - supersymmetric heterotic strings . accordingly , in this section , we review those aspects of such strings which will be important for our work , particularly those aspects related to their finiteness and stability properties . along the way , we will also clarify some potentially subtle points , dispel some common misconceptions , and offer a perhaps unique perspective on these issues which may not be widely appreciated in the string community .",
    "the stability properties of a given closed string can often be analyzed by studying its one - loop partition function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the one - loop modular parameter . in general ,",
    "such partition functions are nothing but the traces over the left- and right - moving string fock spaces , z ( )  =   tr ( -1)^f ^h_r q^h_l  , where @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the right- and left - moving world - sheet hamiltonians whose eigenvalues are the right- and left - moving world - sheet energies @xmath7 , and where @xmath8 denotes the spacetime fermion number .",
    "if the string in question is formulated in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions , then this partition function @xmath3 may be expanded in a double power - series of the form z ( )  =   _ 2 ^ 1-d/2 _ m , n a_mn ^m q^n   [ partfunctgen ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 denotes the net number of spacetime bosonic minus spacetime fermionic string states with world - sheet energies @xmath13 . in general ,",
    "the spacetime mass @xmath14 of a given @xmath15 state is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the string scale ; as a result we see that states with @xmath18 are tachyonic . in general , states with @xmath19 are deemed `` physical '' and can survive as in- or out - states ; these are the states that are usually described as being part of the string spectrum .",
    "by contrast , states with @xmath20 are deemed `` unphysical '' or `` off - shell '' ; such states can not serve as in- or out - states , but can nevertheless propagate within ( and hence contribute to ) loop amplitudes . for heterotic strings , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the leading factors of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ partfunctgen ] ) come from the `` traces '' over the continuum of states corresponding to the uncompactified transverse spacetime dimensions .",
    "modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry of all closed perturbative strings , and requires that the partition function @xmath3 be invariant under @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "invariance under the @xmath26 transformation therefore requires that any @xmath15 string state have @xmath27 . of course , only if @xmath28 will the corresponding state be physical ( `` level - matched '' ) .",
    "if the heterotic string in question has a spectrum exhibiting spacetime supersymmetry , we then have @xmath29 for all @xmath15 . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath30 for supersymmetric theories .",
    "string theories with @xmath31 are therefore necessarily non - supersymmetric , which is one reason the partition function is a particularly powerful tool for explorations of non - supersymmetric theories .    as already implicit in the above discussion , there are two pieces of string folklore which are incorrect but which nevertheless survive in some quarters .",
    "they therefore deserve explicit refutation .    *",
    "the first is that modular invariance somehow requires supersymmetry .",
    "this confusion occurred historically when these two features appeared to be correlated in the earliest string models .",
    "however , it is well known that there is no such correlation in general : there exist many examples of non - supersymmetric string theories which are nevertheless modular invariant . indeed , all of the string theories we shall discuss in this paper are of this variety . *",
    "second , it is also a piece of string folklore  indeed , one which has the same historical roots  that string theories without supersymmetry must be tachyonic .",
    "however , like its cousin , this assertion is also false , at least at tree level : there exist many examples of non - supersymmetric string models whose tree - level spectra are entirely tachyon - free .",
    "note that freedom from tachyonic states in this context merely requires that @xmath32 for all @xmath33  , that the number of bosonic tachyons match the number of fermionic tachyons at all tachyonic mass levels .",
    "however , since fermionic tachyonic states with @xmath34 are generally forbidden by lorentz invariance , the claim that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 actually implies that there are no tachyonic states of any spin whatsoever .",
    "however , we must emphasize that it is at present only a tree - level statement that there exist tachyon - free non - supersymmetric string theories .",
    "once quantum effects are included , the vacua of such non - supersymmetric theories can generally shift , and tachyons might be generated at higher loops .",
    "the status of this issue will be discussed below , and is best studied on a case - by - case basis .",
    "finally , it will be relevant for our later work to understand the relation between partition functions of string theories in different spacetime dimensions .",
    "in general , if a @xmath9-dimensional string theory with partition function @xmath35 is compactified on a @xmath36-dimensional volume @xmath37 , resulting in a @xmath38-dimensional string theory with partition function @xmath39 , we can identify z^(d )  =   _ v_d   [ identifyzs ] where @xmath40 is the reduced string scale .",
    "likewise , if we are dealing with closed strings , then the @xmath41 limit will also generally produce a @xmath9-dimensional string .",
    "this is the result of t - duality . in such cases",
    ", we continue to have the same relation as in eq .",
    "( [ identifyzs ] ) but with @xmath37 replaced with a suitably identified _",
    "volume @xmath42 .",
    "in general there can be many different kinds of physical and unphysical states which contribute to @xmath3 .",
    "however , _ every non - supersymmetric string model necessarily contains off - shell tachyonic states with @xmath43_. this is a general theorem  @xcite which holds regardless of the specific class of non - supersymmetric string model under study , and regardless of the particular gso projections that might be imposed . as a result",
    ", every non - supersymmetric string theory must have @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to understand the origins of this result .",
    "we know that every string model contains a completely ns / ns sector from which the gravity multiplet arises :   _ -1/2^|0_r   _",
    "-1^|0_l  .",
    "[ graviton ] here @xmath45 are the right- and left - moving vacua of the heterotic string , @xmath46 represents the excitation of the right - moving world - sheet neveu - schwarz fermion @xmath47 , and @xmath48 represents the excitation of the left - moving coordinate boson @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , no self - consistent gso projection can possibly eliminate this gravity multiplet from the string spectrum .",
    "however , given that the graviton is always in the string spectrum , then there must also exist in the string spectrum a corresponding state for which the left - moving coordinate oscillator is _ not _ excited :   _ -1/2^|0_r   |0_l",
    ". [ protograviton ] this `` proto - graviton '' state has world - sheet energies @xmath50 , and is thus off - shell and tachyonic .",
    "however , it always exists in the string spectrum so long as the graviton exists .",
    "( in cft language , they are part of the same verma module , with the graviton appearing as a descendant of the proto - graviton . )",
    "we shall see explicit examples of this below .    of course , in a supersymmetric theory",
    ", there is likewise a `` proto - gravitino '' state which also exists in the spectrum :   _ 0^|0_r    |0_l  , [ protogravitino ] where @xmath51 schematically indicates the ramond zero - mode combinations which collectively give rise to the spacetime lorentz spinor index @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , this state is ultimately related to the gravitino in exactly the same way as the proto - graviton is related to the graviton .",
    "thus , in a supersymmetric theory , the contributions from the proto - graviton and proto - gravitino states cancel in the full partition function , so that the full partition function lacks a contribution @xmath53 ( and in fact vanishes entirely ) .",
    "however , _ any gso projection which eliminates the gravitino from the string spectrum and thereby produces a non - supersymmetric string will also correspondingly eliminate the proto - gravitino state_. this is ultimately because gso projections are completely insensitive to the excitations of the coordinate bosons .",
    "there will therefore be nothing to cancel against the contribution from the proto - graviton state , and the resulting non - supersymmetric partition function will necessarily have @xmath54 .    in general , as evident from eq .",
    "( [ protograviton ] ) , the proto - graviton states transform as vectors under the transverse spacetime lorentz symmetry @xmath55 .",
    "thus , any non - supersymmetric string theory in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions must have a partition function which begins with the contribution z ( )  =   d-2 q  +   ... [ protogravitoncontributions ] checking this term thus provides a convenient method of verifying the overall normalization of a given string partition function .      in string theory ,",
    "conformal invariance kills the tree - level contribution to the vacuum energy density ( cosmological constant ) . as a result ,",
    "the dominant contribution to this quantity comes at one - loop order . in general , for any string model in @xmath9 dimensions with partition function @xmath3 , the corresponding @xmath9-dimensional one - loop vacuum energy density may be evaluated as ^(d )   -m^d _ f d^2 ^2 z ( )   [ cosconstdef ] where @xmath9 is the number of uncompactified spacetime dimensions , where @xmath56 is the reduced string scale defined above , and where  :  |re| ,   im>0 ,  ||1[fdef ] is the fundamental domain of the modular group . in general , it is convenient to regard the fundamental domain @xmath57 as being composed of two separate regions , an `` upper '' region with @xmath58 and a `` lower '' region with @xmath59 .",
    "the upper region extends across the full width @xmath60 ; in this region , the @xmath61-integration then guarantees that only the states with @xmath19 survive as contributors to @xmath62 .",
    "however , even the unphysical states with @xmath63 will make contributions to @xmath62 through integration over the lower region within @xmath57 .",
    "thus , _ all _ states  both physical and unphysical  are relevant in calculations of @xmath62 .    in the following",
    "we shall usually disregard the prefactor @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ cosconstdef ] ) and regard @xmath62 as a pure number , but we note that a proper definition does indeed require it .",
    "we shall , however , retain the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) in all discussions below .",
    "furthermore , we observe that if a @xmath9-dimensional string with partition function @xmath35 is compactified on a @xmath36-dimensional volume @xmath37 , resulting in a @xmath38-dimensional string with partition function @xmath39 , then @xmath65 will typically diverge as @xmath66 . in such cases , we can alternatively define @xmath67 ; note that @xmath68 continues to describe the @xmath38-dimensional theory but now has the mass dimensions appropriate for a @xmath9-dimensional [ rather than @xmath69-dimensional ] vacuum energy density . substituting the result in eq .",
    "( [ identifyzs ] ) , we then find that ^(d )  =   _ v_d ^(d - d )  .",
    "the same relations also hold in the @xmath70 limit , provided we replace @xmath37 with the appropriate t - dual volume @xmath42 .    as apparent from its definition in eq .",
    "( [ cosconstdef ] ) , the cosmological constant @xmath62 is real .",
    "this means that when evaluating @xmath62 , only the _ symmetric _ part of the physical - state degeneracy matrix @xmath71 within the partition function @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ partfunctgen ] ) is relevant .",
    "more precisely , for any degeneracy matrix @xmath71 , we can define a corresponding matrix  @xcite a_mn     a_mn + a_nm & for   m > n a_mn & for   m = n 0 & otherwise  .    as long as any two degeneracy matrices have the same @xmath73 , they will give rise to the same cosmological constant .",
    "conversely , it follows that any purely imaginary partition function with @xmath74 for all @xmath15 will give rise to @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 .",
    "of course , no self - consistent non - supersymmetric heterotic - string partition function can possibly be purely imaginary : we have already seen that the partition function of any non - supersymmetric heterotic string must have @xmath54 , yet we can not also have the non - zero value for @xmath77 that would also be required for a purely imaginary partition function since this would violate the heterotic - string bound @xmath21 . it _ is _ possible , however , for two string models to have partition functions which _ differ _ by a purely imaginary function and thereby share the same cosmological constant .",
    "this feature , along with the existence of additional modular functions which also integrate to zero , turns out to be responsible for a large one - loop degeneracy within the space of non - supersymmetric four - dimensional string vacua  @xcite",
    ".    it will be important for later purposes to have some sense of the relative sizes of the contributions to the cosmological constant ( [ cosconstdef ] ) that come from individual @xmath15 string states .",

    "given the exponential suppression of their cosmological constants , it is interesting to investigate the behavior of models with equal numbers of massless bosons and fermions under interpolation .",
    "there are several issues of importance .",
    "first there is the question of what the exponential suppression means for the spectrum at large radius , and if one expects the small radius limit to exhibit the same form .",
    "connected with this is the interpolation of the cosmological constant @xmath88 from large to small @xmath89 .",
    "two other important issues are whether tachyons can appear at some small critical radius @xmath90 , signalling a hagedorn - like instability , and whether there is restoration of gauge symmetry .",
    "we begin by discussing the low - lying spectra of models with suppressed cosmological constants in the limit of large interpolating radius ( , the limit @xmath91 ) . in general , these spectra have the general structure schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcspectra ] .",
    "first , there is a natural division into a visible sector and a `` hidden '' sector , where by `` visible '' we refer to the states associated with the standard model ( or one of its unified extensions ) and where by `` hidden '' we refer to states which do not carry standard - model gauge quantum numbers .",
    "each sector contains not only these states but also their would - be superpartners whose masses are generally shifted by an amount @xmath92 ; thus neither sector is supersymmetric except in the infinite - radius limit . the lightest states in each sector consist of the @xmath93 string states , along with their kk excitations .",
    "however , at higher mass levels @xmath94 , these sectors generically also contain string oscillator states , winding states , and states coming from twisted sectors .",
    "this much is general for all semi - realistic interpolating models .",
    "however , for interpolating models with suppressed cosmological constants , the observable and hidden sectors have one additional feature : they contain exactly equal and opposite net numbers of bosons and fermionic states with masses @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , this property holds for all sufficiently small radii ; in particular , the strict @xmath96 limit is not required .",

    "however , we also know that @xmath102 contains the contributions from our observable massless states , and by assumption ( or through experimental observation ) we know that these states do not , by themselves , contain equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom . as a result , the only way to achieve @xmath105 ( where the superscript ` @xmath106 ' signifies the massless level ) is to recognize that in such cases @xmath102 must itself contain contributions from both an observable sector and a separate hidden sector .",
    "this hidden sector need not bear any relation to the observable sector except that it must have an equal and opposite net ( bosonic minus fermionic ) number of massless states in order to satisfy the condition @xmath105 for @xmath102 as a whole . since @xmath99",
    ", the same must also be true of the would - be superpartners , whereupon their respective multiplications by @xmath103 and @xmath104 guarantee that the same will also be true for their low - lying kk states .",

    "[ fig : cdcmissusyplots ] .",
    "moreover , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcmissusyplots ] that for sufficiently small @xmath110 , the physical - state degeneracies @xmath108 for all @xmath111 vanish exactly ; this reflects the cancellation of bosonic states and fermionic states between the observable and hidden sectors respectively , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcspectra ] .",
    "this `` evacuation '' of net physical - state degeneracies below @xmath112 as @xmath96 is thus the hallmark of interpolating string models with suppressed cosmological constants .",
    "the form of these physical - state degeneracies can also be understood from the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 55b ] ) . at large @xmath89 ( or small @xmath110 ) we see that we may neglect terms with non - zero @xmath113 ( just as in the evaluation of the cosmological constant ) .",
    "thus the low - mass spectrum is identical to the massless spectrum except for the shift in `` effective '' kaluza - klein number induced by @xmath114 .",
    "however @xmath115 shifts an equal number of bosons and fermions in the massless sector , as well as all of their kaluza - klein modes .",
    "thus the spectrum actually exhibits @xmath116 _ for all states up to the first - excited string oscillator mass level _ , even though there is no supersymmetry in the string spectrum . indeed ,",
    "as remarked above , we have what might be called a `` fake supersymmetry '' which is actually the result of a conspiracy between the observable and hidden sectors of such models .",
    "however , this `` fake supersymmetry '' holds merely at the level of counting physical states . in particular",

    ", we see that at small @xmath89 different winding modes require a shift , @xmath122 , in order to remain light , with a corresponding shift in kk number , @xmath123 , to cancel the net kk contribution .",
    "hence at generic but small @xmath89 only the even winding modes of the @xmath120 states are light ( where we use ` even ' to refer to @xmath124 ) .    at this point",
    ", one might erroneously conclude that these low - lying states correspond to simply taking the physical states with @xmath125 and mapping them to a set of even winding modes with charge and net kk number given respectively by @xmath126 and @xmath123 , mimicking what happens for the kk modes at large radius .",
    "however this would not be correct because the shift in @xmath127 also affects the gso projection , , it affects the factor @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 53 ] ) which includes a phase @xmath129 .",
    "this phase is shifted by a factor @xmath130 with respect to the non - winding sector , and some of the overlaps @xmath131 generate @xmath132-integer values .",
    "thus while one particular subset of the winding modes  namely , those with @xmath133mod(4 )  still exhibit the @xmath134 cancellation of the massless sector , the remainder  those with @xmath135  have different projections and generally do not exhibit this cancellation .",
    "this is evident within the large-@xmath110 ( small-@xmath89 ) plot within fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcmissusyplots ] , where we observe that the low - mass states no longer exhibit such cancellations .",
    "we therefore do not expect the exponential suppression of the cosmological constant to be a feature of these models when interpolated to @xmath136 or @xmath137 .",
    "meanwhile , the winding modes of the states that were given masses by @xmath138 at large @xmath89 have different behavior . because of the shift in kk number , at small @xmath89 these states can have low - lying _ odd _ winding modes , with @xmath139 again compensating to make the net kk contribution vanish .",
    "denoting by @xmath140 the charges of the original non - winding states , we see that the low - lying winding states have charges shifted as @xmath141 , with m_1,2+*eq*-(n_1+n_2)*e*^2  =  0  , so there are indeed odd - winding / kk states with no net kk number .",
    "of particular importance now is the fact that the @xmath142 projection is reversed for these low - lying odd - winding modes , but the @xmath143 projection is unaffected , again due to the @xmath130 shift in the gso phase .",
    "thus the projection in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 27 ] ) removes the odd winding modes of the gravitini , and moreover odd winding modes of ns - ns tachyons are _ in principle _ allowed . among the low - lying states at small @xmath89 there",

    "if they existed , would have @xmath146 , but it is easy to check that in these models they are projected out ( in the shifted gso projections of the odd - winding sector ) by the projections associated with the @xmath147 vector ( in the basis of appendix  d ) .",
    "thus we do not expect to find a tachyon - induced ( hagedorn - like ) instability at @xmath148 , and this can indeed be verified by inspection of the partition function .",
    "it is tempting to conclude that the absence of such tachyon - induced hagedorn - like instabilities is a special feature of models with exponentially suppressed cosmological constants .",
    "such a property certainly applies for generic non - supersymmetric string models which interpolate between an @xmath149 endpoint which is supersymmetric and an @xmath150 endpoint which is non - supersymmetric but tachyon - free .",
    "the question , however , is whether all interpolating models with @xmath116 must be in this category .    further analyzing the generic spectrum as a function of radius",
    ", we also note that the point @xmath151 ( or @xmath152 ) is normally a point of enhanced gauge symmetry for @xmath153 compactifications where the entire theory can be fermionized in order to take the form of a fermionic string ( see , , ref .",
    "accordingly , in the theory without cdc , it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 55b ] ) that additional massless states appear with @xmath154 when either @xmath155 or @xmath156 . however , _ in the cdc theory _",
    ", we observe that such symmetry enhancement can not occur for states with @xmath157 because such enhancement implies @xmath158  , there would inevitably be a non - zero net kk number .",
    "moreover the lightest squared masses would correspond to @xmath159 which can satisfy level - matching constraints only when there are equal numbers of left - moving and right - moving excitations .",
    "these states are therefore eliminated from the spectrum through the projection associated with @xmath143 . by similar arguments ,",
    "winding modes of states with @xmath160 can not lead to additional massless states either .",
    "therefore at the traditional enhanced symmetry point there does not seem to be a direct link to the 4d fermionic string although ( as mentioned previously ) it is interesting to conjecture that the model there corresponds to a conventional 4d model broken to a tachyon - free non - supersymmetric model by discrete torsion .    5.0 truein    given these observations",
    ", we now numerically evaluate the cosmological constant @xmath161 of the pati - salam model as a function of the inverse radius @xmath162 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcinterplot ] , and are consistent with the gross features that one would expect from the above discussion , namely that the cosmological constant is finite for all radii , exponentially suppressed in the large - radius limit , and radius - independent in the small - radius limit .",
    "this last observation suggests the existence of a zero - radius endpoint model with an entirely non - supersymmetric but tachyon - free spectrum  one which might well correspond to a 6d fermionic string constructed with discrete torsion .",
    "more surprisingly , however , just above ( but not at ) the self - dual radius , we find a stable anti - de sitter minimum .",
    "this turn - over could indicate a restoration of gauge symmetry and/or supersymmetry , and is similar to the situation encountered in the type  ii models of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , despite these interesting features which suggest the possibility of stabilizing the _ radius _ modulus near @xmath109 , our interest in this paper remains focused on the large - radius limit where the one - loop cosmological constant  and hence the one - loop dilaton tadpole  is exponentially suppressed . indeed , as discussed in sects .",
    "ii through iv , only under such conditions can we claim to have addressed the ( more fundamental ) _ dilaton_-related stability issues associated with non - supersymmetric strings .",
    "moreover , in this limit , @xmath163 is also suppressed .",
    "thus we have an effectively flat potential for the radius modulus in this region , similar to what exists for softly - broken supersymmetric models of this type . indeed , as already noted at the end of sect .",
    "ii , any `` rolling '' of the radius modulus which happens sufficiently slowly can certainly be tolerated within the cosmological history of the universe .",
    "we now turn to some of the phenomenological aspects associated with these models .",
    "some of these are quite general and would apply to any non - supersymmetric string model of this type .",
    "however , others  such as natural particle assignments and yukawa couplings  are quite model - specific and are best analyzed within the context of a specific model . but perhaps most interestingly , some features  in particular , possible exponentially suppressed radiative contributions to scalar masses  are closely related to the exponential suppression of the cosmological constant .",
    "we first consider the more model - independent aspects , such as how one might wish to identify the particles of the standard model in terms of specific string states .",
    "returning to the sm - like compactification presented in section  vi.b.2 ( and neglecting its cosmological constant ) , let us recall that supersymmetry breaking is manifest only for the untwisted generations at leading order . while this supersymmetry breaking will inevitably appear in the twisted generations as well due to rg running ( for the colored particles the contributions would largely come from the gluino )",
    ", the breaking in the twisted generations will almost certainly be smaller than that in the untwisted ones , assuming that untwisted matter exists at all .",
    "recently it has been argued  @xcite that scherk - schwarz configurations may enhance `` naturalness '' in the sense advanced in ref .  @xcite . from this point of view ,",
    "a natural assignment is to take the untwisted generation to be the first generation of the standard model and the two twisted generations to be the second and third generations .",
    "the large susy - splitting within the first generation does indeed then indicate a certain degree of naturalness , and as such it seems like a good starting point for having reduced third generation masses while evading experimental bounds on , , the gluino , which one would expect to be heavy .",
    "given that the second generation is also relatively light , there are many flavor - related issues that would need to be addressed ; indeed , one would hope that a sufficiently heavy first generation , along with relatively mild partial cancellation of radiative contributions to the third generation , would suffice .    within field theory",
    ", these would be difficult questions to address as there are threshold contributions from the entire tower of states in the spectrum .",
    "probably one would have to resort to setting soft terms as boundary conditions at the compactification scale .",
    "however , one of the appealing aspects of the present constructions is that one does not have to rely on field theory ; indeed all the leading effects including thresholds and rg running can in principle be simply computed from scratch within string perturbation theory .",
    "we shall discuss how such terms would be calculated below , although a comprehensive study would be worthwhile only within a completely realistic sm - like setup .",
    "it would of course be interesting to see if the results indeed favored any kind of naturalness in such a model .",
    "it is useful for pedagogical reasons to begin by considering yukawa couplings within the framework of the sm - like theory of sect .",
    "vi.b.2 which had @xmath164 but @xmath165 .",
    "in particular , this will inform our eventual discussion below for the pati - salam model with realistic higgs sectors , which is the model most closely resembling the pedagogical sm - like theory .",
    ":   for the moment , let us focus on the fact that supersymmetry breaking in the twisted generations is generally suppressed , and see how this squares with the couplings .",
    "along the way , we shall also determine which of the three higgses in this model is best suited to be _ the _ higgs .",
    "the possible yukawa couplings are determined by the non - sm charges under horizontal @xmath166 symmetries .",
    "the number of these depends on the assignment of the boundary conditions in the defining spin structure .",
    "every model has at least three horizontal @xmath167 @xmath168 symmetries for the left - moving world - sheet currents and three matching global @xmath169 @xmath168 symmetries from the right - moving world - sheet currents . with @xmath170",
    ", these world - sheet currents may be denoted @xmath171 a quick glance at the spectrum reveals that the chiral matter states arising from the @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 sectors sectors and the higgses , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , carry charges under @xmath177 and @xmath178 respectively .",
    "given that supersymmetry breaking is concentrated in the @xmath172 sector , we adopt the assignment that states from the @xmath172 sector are first generation while those from the @xmath173 and @xmath174 twisted sectors are second and third generations , respectively .",
    "in addition to these symmetries there are other horizontal @xmath179 symmetries from the complexification of pairs of real world - sheet fermions from the subsets @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",

    "indeed , in a uv - finite theory , there is one and only one cutoff required , namely the physical ( wilsonian ) infrared one leading to renormalization , while issues such as uv divergences and counterterms are simply spurious artifacts of working within an incomplete theory .",

    "our main purpose thus far has been to establish a _ stable _",
    "framework for studying non - supersymmetric models . in this section",
    ", however , we shall finally approach the question of what might constitute reasonable energy and mass scales for the phenomenologies of such models .",
    "one issue , in particular , concerns the all - important question of whether some scalars  and in particular the higgs discussed in the previous section  might naturally remain light",
    ". however , there are also other pressing scale - related phenomenological issues , such as the potentially large contributions to the gauge - coupling beta functions due to the preponderance of kk modes that necessarily appear in such models . indeed , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the latter is the well - known `` decompactification problem '' which tends to mitigate against large compactification radii in the ( weakly coupled ) heterotic string .",
    "let us first recall some well - known relations between the various different mass scales .",
    "inspection of the effective potential reveals that for closed strings , our four - dimensional gauge and gravitational couplings are related to the underlying ten - dimensional string coupling @xmath276 through the volume @xmath277 of compactification : @xmath278 where the string length is given by @xmath279 .",
    "together these give the tree - level relation @xmath280 this relation , which can be recast into the somewhat more familiar form @xmath281 , suggests that we interpret @xmath282 is the four - dimensional gauge coupling at the string scale ( here interpreted as a unification scale ) .",
    "let us henceforth assume that we have succeeded in ensuring @xmath283 ( thereby producing an exponentially suppressed cosmological constant ) . for six - dimensional cdc s as we have been considering in this paper ( and assuming that @xmath116 holds only for the @xmath93 modes ) , this implies",
    "^1/4  ~   m r^-3/8 e^-r/2   [ cosvalue ] where @xmath284 .",
    "there are then two cases to consider , depending on whether we have also ensured @xmath285 ( thereby producing an exponential suppression for the scalar masses ) .",
    "if the scalar masses are unsuppressed , then we have seen that their leading radius - dependence takes the form m_scalar  ~   m r^-3   .",
    "[ scalarmasses ] of course , the inferred / measured values are ^1/4 & ~ & 10 ^ -12 + m_scalar & ~ & 10 ^ 2 . solving simultaneously , we then find that @xmath286 and @xmath287  gev .",
    "together , this implies a kk scale of @xmath288  gev .",
    "it is hardly surprising that this scale emerges because in this scenario susy breaking is essentially gauge - mediated to the previously massless higgses .",
    "therefore , even if the higgs is identified as a state emerging from the quasi - supersymmetric twisted sectors , we would not expect very different conclusions .",
    "such a small string scale is clearly incompatible with eq .   unless there is an extremely small @xmath289 .",
    "now , it is indeed a logical possibility that such a tiny tree - level gauge coupling at the string scale could run down to values of order one at the electroweak scale  precisely because of the power - law running induced by the @xmath290 kk modes  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the hierarchy problem remains but is softened in overall magnitude and is in a sense dimensionally transmuted : a fine - tuning of one part in @xmath291 is required for the gauge couplings , where a huge threshold would have to be balanced against a huge @xmath292 .",
    "however , such a scenario may be of interest because it is in a sense the opposite of the `` brane - world '' scenario  indeed here it is the gauge couplings that do the work of differentiating themselves from gravity by growing large !",
    "an alternative way that such scales could be incorporated is instead to have @xmath293 at tree - level and arrange for the contribution from @xmath290 kk modes either to be absent @xcite or to be ameliorated by having the @xmath294 breaking also occurring spontaneously , as in refs .",
    "a drawback is then that one would have to accommodate strong coupling in the string theory , which can be done by mapping to weakly coupled dual theories above certain intermediate energy scales .",
    "this mapping would of course depend on the geometry of the compactification .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review . ) despite the fact that the perturbative computations we have performed here would then be somewhat suspect , it nevertheless seems likely that the exponential suppression of the cosmological constant would survive .",
    "indeed , it may be possible to incorporate either of these mechanisms using the formalism presented here .",
    "let us now assume instead that the contribution to the `` higgs '' masses are also exponentially suppressed because @xmath295 .",
    "( this is actually relatively easy to achieve . ) the resulting one - loop scalar mass then takes the form m_scalar  ~   r^-5/4 e^-r  , replacing eq .",
    "( [ scalarmasses ] ) . in such a setup , the gauge hierarchy is clearly eliminated ( although further cancellation of the cosmological constant would be required ) .",
    "assuming that the exponential suppression continues to higher order and that a final cancellation of the ( still exponentially suppressed ) cosmological constant happens within field theory , it turns out that a value of @xmath296 suffices to bring the higgs masses to @xmath297  gev with a canonical heterotic value of @xmath298  gev .",
    "such a value of @xmath89 still leads to an energy interval marked by power - law running of the gauge couplings , yet gauge coupling unification can still occur without unacceptable fine - tuning  @xcite . in some sense , this scenario is more in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite since , in terms of the exponential prefactor originating from the partition function , it yields @xmath299 .",
    "it is also more in the spirit of gravity mediation .",
    "unfortunately , because of course all the gauginos feel supersymmetry breaking directly , it is not possible to obtain the cleanest option of a higgs in a globally supersymmetric sector that couples to supersymmetry breaking only through gravitational interactions .",
    "the above scenarios clearly rest on the assumption that the theory continues to mask gauge - mediation of susy breaking to higher orders , which of course would be interesting to investigate .",
    "however , even if this assumption turns out to be incorrect , these constructions nevertheless supply a framework for stable non - supersymmetric string model - building in which @xmath56 takes its canonical value a little below the planck scale , while generic dimensionful operators would be two - loop suppressed with respect to that .",
    "this alone is of considerable interest .",
    "one of the most challenging aspects of non - supersymmetric strings is their lack of stability . while many perturbative strings have unfixed moduli , non - supersymmetric strings have an added difficulty in that they generically give rise to non - zero dilaton tadpoles .",
    "this feature afflicts even those non - supersymmetric strings which are free of physical tachyons at tree level , and represents a fundamental obstacle for the use of such strings as the basis for a non - supersymmetric string phenomenology .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrated that this problem can be overcome within a class of perturbative four - dimensional heterotic strings based on coordinate - dependent compactifications ( cdc s ) .",
    "we began by discussing several crucial aspects associated with the spectra of non - supersymmetric string models  including the importance of off - shell states such as the proto - gravitons and proto - gravitinos  and studied the leading and subleading contributions from these and other states to their one - loop cosmological constants .",
    "we also discussed in detail the behavior of generic interpolations between completely supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric models , and the importance of `` misaligned supersymmetry '' in ensuring the finiteness of these theories .",
    "we stress that despite the fact that such breakings of supersymmetry are spontaneous , from a four - dimensional perspective this susy breaking is not `` soft '' in the usual sense of that term .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy between the numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom at adjacent energy levels does not fall to zero asympotically but actually grows exponentially with energy .",
    "such models are therefore genuinely non - supersymmetric by construction and at all energy scales .",
    "we then went on to construct phenomenologically appealing models that have equal numbers of massless bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "as we demonstrated by explicit calculation , such models therefore have exponentially suppressed one - loop cosmological constants and exponentially suppressed dilaton tadpoles .",
    "we presented an sm - like model , a pati - salam model , a flipped @xmath300 model , and even an @xmath301 grand - unified model . while none of these models has all of the desirable phenomenological features one would want in order to serve as the starting point for a detailed phenomenological study , they all nevertheless exhibited equal numbers of massless bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom and thus suppressed instabilities .",
    "indeed , these properties were verified in three independent ways : through their partition functions , through their poisson - resummed large - radius expansions , and through explicit construction and examination of their low - lying spectra .",
    "these models thereby avoid the most serious problems associated with non - supersymmetric strings , and may point the way towards new directions in non - supersymmetric string model - building and string phenomenology",
    ".    as we demonstrated , such models are most easily built by starting with existing self - consistent supersymmetric four - dimensional string theories , and lifting them to @xmath0 in six dimensions .",
    "the resulting theories are then re - compactified back down to four dimensions on an orbifold using a cdc , which may be viewed as a generalization of scherk - schwarz compactification .",
    "our basic starting four - dimensional model was formulated in the so - called free - fermionic construction , but there is no reason why our procedure can not be duplicated within other formalisms .",
    "all of our models were derived from the same @xmath0 4d model , and chiral generations of matter coming from both twisted and untwisted sectors are possible .",
    "moreover , we found that it is straightforward to construct other models by altering the boundary conditions assigned to the vectors of the theory as well as adjusting the choice of cdc vector @xmath204 .",
    "such models all exhibit what we have called a `` fake supersymmetry '' which characterizes their low - lying kk spectra .",
    "however , this is not a supersymmetry in any literal sense , since it only relates an aggregate of bosonic states in an observable sector to an aggregate of fermionic states in a presumably hidden sector , and vice versa .",
    "moreover , this feature applies only to the kk excitations of the massless modes .",
    "indeed , the massive string - oscillator excitations do not exhibit any such bosonic / fermionic degeneracies , and instead it is only through a so - called `` misaligned supersymmetry '' at all mass levels that the finiteness of such strings is ensured .",
    "the general phenomenology of such models is that the gauge sector and the untwisted matter sectors may or may not feel the supersymmetry breaking directly , with states in these sectors gaining masses of order @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the generic compactification radius from six to four dimensions .",
    "by contrast , the twisted sectors are initially unaffected , with states gaining masses only radiatively .",
    "we demonstrated by explicit calculation within our pati - salam model that even if the cosmological constant is exponentially suppressed , the contributions to the latter do not generally cancel at leading ( one - loop ) order .",
    "one appealing aspect of this setup is that all of these radiative terms ( including their rg running ) are completely calculable within the string theory , and finite .",
    "note that the terms we calculated are simply `` soft '' squared - mass terms in a potential , and as such they can be either positive or negative depending on the net sign of @xmath304  , depending on whether more bosonic or fermionic massless degrees of freedom couple to the higgs .",
    "a negative sign would lead to additional symmetry breaking , with the potential being stabilized in the usual way by quartic terms that may also be present in the potential .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the questions we have addressed in this paper  involving the cosmological constant , vacuum stability , and the mass hierarchy for scalars such as the higgs  are some of the most challenging and unique problems facing non - supersymmetric string models .",
    "however , they are all related within the framework of the models we have studied because there is only one source of supersymmetry breaking which is in a sense responsible for all of them .",
    "indeed , this is precisely because these models are all intrinsically non - supersymmetric , even at the string scale",
    ". the tight self - consistency constraints of our string constructions therefore unavoidably tie the resolutions of these different problems to each other .",
    "as we discussed , there is an interesting range of mass scales for which such a configuration can be consistent and produce interesting sufficiently small cosmological - constant values and at the same time reasonable radiative physical masses for scalars .",
    "however low string scales appear to be necessary , at least for this scenario , implying ultimately either some form of strong coupling or large gauge threshold correction from kk modes . however , alternative ranges of mass scales may be capable of avoiding these conclusions , and may be compatible with perturbative unification near the canonical heterotic string scale .",
    "it was suggested a long time ago that non - supersymmetric string compactifications would benefit from exponentially suppressed cosmological constants if the massless bosons and fermions obeyed @xmath134 .",
    "this paper has developed these ideas , thereby laying the groundwork for new classes of non - supersymmetric models built entirely within a heterotic string framework .",
    "our view of the phenomenological viability of the resulting models is that they are morally equivalent to non - stabilized supersymmetric strings , in the sense that the latter ( once supersymmetry is broken ) typically also have runaway dilaton potentials comparable to the potential for the compactification radius we find here .",
    "presumably many of the string - theory and field - theory techniques that have been brought to bear on those problem in the supersymmetric case could now be applied in this case as well , the only difference being that supersymmetry is broken in the string construction itself .",
    "more generally , it will be necessary to study the complete moduli spaces of these theories in order to verify their full stability : in principle all the massless singlets will receive squared masses that , as we have seen , could be of either sign depending on the particles that couple in the loops associated with their radiative corrections",
    ". clearly one would like to avoid the @xmath8-flat directions becoming tachyonic .",
    "there are many possibilities for future work beyond those we have already mentioned .",
    "for example , the precise nature of the model under interpolation ( including the identity of the tachyon - free non - supersymmetric six - dimensional string model at the @xmath305 endpoint ) is of some interest , as is the precise form of the potential and its relation to an effective softly - broken supersymmetry theory .",
    "interpreting the various features associated with potentials such as that in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcinterplot ] is likely to be important , especially insofar as the corresponding dynamics is concerned . on the more phenomenological side",
    ", it would obviously be desirable to construct a complete three - generation sm - like theory with an exponentially small one - loop cosmological constant and a working higgs sector .",
    "the advantage of such a model would be that all scalar masses would ( as we have seen ) be calculable and finite .",
    "furthermore , being non - supersymmetric by construction , the yukawa couplings would also receive radiative corrections suppressed by powers of @xmath306 .",
    "it would then be interesting to see if these would have a bearing on the hierarchies of the standard model , and how they relate to their corresponding expressions in softly - broken supersymmetric field theories .",
    "one question that certainly deserves further study is whether the exponential suppression continues beyond one - loop order . indeed",
    ", such higher - order questions inevitably depend not only on the spectra of these theories but also on their interactions . given the `` fake supersymmetry '' in the spectrum , it is reasonable to speculate that such suppressions continue to persist to higher orders , especially since in the effective field theory all loops",
    "would be expected to experience the same cancellations in such a theory while the couplings exhibit a high degree of degeneracy . given the promise of these models , a careful analysis beyond one - loop certainly seems warranted .",
    "in summary , then , we believe that the models and methods presented here can potentially serve as a starting point for the development of a bona - fide non - supersymmetric string phenomenology . while numerous unresolved issues  both theoretical and phenomenological  clearly remain , the evident existence of a large number of models with suppressed dilaton tadpoles suggests the existence of a huge landscape of potentially stable models with varying theoretical and phenomenological features and prospects . it therefore remains to explore this landscape with all the tools at hand in order to determine the extent to which a truly successful non - supersymmetric string phenomenology is possible .",

    "v_{i\\geq2 } & = & ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this basis is always possible because the @xmath377 vector must always be present for modular invariance , and because there must be gravitini in the supersymmetric model . the sector in which these appear can be taken to define the @xmath378 sector .",
    "in addition we may assume that the right - movers have only @xmath106 and @xmath379 boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , since the lowest possible vacuum energy on the right - moving side is @xmath379 , a tachyon can appear _ only _ if there are no right - moving ns excitations .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath380 projections on the gravitini , @xmath381 where @xmath382 are the chirality projections where the vectors overlap with the ramond states ; for the gravitini they are necessarily degenerate . by inspection the massless gravitini have no excitations .",
    "it then follows that @xmath383 for them .",
    "thus these equations are compatible if and only if @xmath384 mod(1 ) , which must be true since @xmath385 by the relations in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 1.1 ] ) . however , an incompatibility for these states can occur if there is an additional vector ( or combination of vectors ) that does not overlap with @xmath142 .",
    "this is because if there were an overlap , then any projection would simply fix the definition of chirality of a subset of the spinors .",
    "let us call this additional vector @xmath386 , so that @xmath387 if @xmath388 then the gravitini are projected out and supersymmetry is broken .",
    "this conclusion is general .",
    "indeed , if it were instead a combination of vectors that did not overlap with @xmath142 , then it would be the corresponding linear combination of @xmath389 that would have to sum to @xmath192 in order to break supersymmetry .",
    "( note that a @xmath386 completely overlapping with @xmath142 could also be incompatible , but this is again equivalent to a new vector @xmath390 that has no overlap with @xmath142 . )",
    "such models correspond to supersymmetry breaking by discrete torsion .    given this",
    ", one can then prove the following : _ tachyons can be present in the resulting non - supersymmetric model only if there are sectors including @xmath386 that have negative vacuum energy_. to see this , let us assume that there is a would - be tachyonic sector @xmath374 .",
    "normally this would be just the ns - ns sector ; however , it could also involve some @xmath391 . in the supersymmetric theory , since these states are absent they must be projected out by @xmath392 because without @xmath392 there is no supersymmetry . hence tachyons are absent if and only if @xmath393 note that @xmath394 appears in this equation only if @xmath395 .",
    "thus , in sectors without @xmath386 , the projection or otherwise of the gravitini is independent of the projection of the tachyons .",
    "since the supersymmetric theory is tachyon - free , it follows that the theories with discrete torsion which have the `` wrong '' choice of @xmath396 also have no tachyons in these sectors , and are thus also tachyon - free .",
    "it remains to consider sectors that _ do _ contain @xmath386 .",
    "let us denote such sectors as @xmath397 .",
    "the overlap of @xmath386 with @xmath142 is zero , so the left side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : 28 ] ) is the same as it is for the sector @xmath398 . likewise",
    "the right side of this equation is @xmath399 , which differs only by @xmath400 from the version without @xmath386 .",
    "therefore , since there are no tachyons in any @xmath398 sector without @xmath386 , the `` wrong '' choice @xmath388 may be consistent with tachyons in any sector that _ does _ contain @xmath386 , provided there is negative vacuum energy ( on both left and right moving sides ) .",
    "this completes our proof .",
    "it is of course intuitively correct that the appearance of tachyons must involve the vector responsible for projecting out the gravitino .",
    "we now also understand why the @xmath401 model presented in the main text could already be broken even before any scherk - schwarz effect simply by a choice of @xmath347 : the vector @xmath402 has no overlap with @xmath142 .",
    "needless to say it is not hard to avoid such breaking .    in general , it is not difficult to exploit these observations in order to generate non - supersymmetric string models whose tree - level spectra are tachyon - free .",
    "a particularly large collection of such models is presented and analyzed in refs .",
    "in this appendix we collect together the definitions of the four non - supersymmetric string models presented in sect .",
    "as discussed in the main text , these models are realized through the free - fermionic construction followed by a cdc .   along the way ,",
    "a significant number of constraints are applied :    * as always , the boundary - condition vectors and @xmath347 structure constants must satisfy modular - invariance constraints .",
    "* likewise , the additional modular - invariance constraints for real fermions must also be satisfied . * as part of our construction",
    ", we demand that removing the cdc restore supersymmetry . * likewise , we demand that there exist an alternative choice of certain @xmath347 s ( such as @xmath403 or some other combination ) which can also restore supersymmetry . *",
    "finally , we also demand that in at least one twisted sector , the boundary conditions  including the orbifold vector @xmath173  must overlap with precisely one half of the entries of the cdc vector @xmath404 .",
    "moreover , we demand that overlaps of complex phases with the cdc vector not be allowed . in this way",
    ", we ensure that there is a basis in which the orbifold acts as a charge conjugation on the cdc charges ( plus possible untwisted phases , depending on the sector ) .",

    "<S> over the past three decades , considerable effort has been devoted to studying the rich and diverse phenomenologies of heterotic strings exhibiting spacetime supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , during this same period , there has been relatively little work studying the phenomenologies associated with their non - supersymmetric counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> the primary reason for this relative lack of attention is the fact that strings without spacetime supersymmetry are generally unstable , exhibiting large one - loop dilaton tadpoles . in this paper , we demonstrate that this hurdle can be overcome in a class of tachyon - free four - dimensional string models realized through coordinate - dependent compactifications . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as we shall see , it is possible to construct models in this class whose low - lying states resemble the standard model ( or even potential unified extensions thereof )  all without any light superpartners , and indeed without supersymmetry at any energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such models thus opens the door to general studies of non - supersymmetric string phenomenology , and in this paper we proceed to discuss a variety of theoretical and phenomenological issues associated with such non - supersymmetric strings . on the theoretical side , we discuss the finiteness properties of such strings , the general characteristics of their mass spectra , the magnitude and behavior of their one - loop cosmological constants , and their interpolation properties . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , on the phenomenological side , the properties we discuss are more model - specific and include their construction techniques , their natural energy scales , their particle and charge assignments , and the magnitudes of their associated yukawa couplings and scalar masses .    </S>",
