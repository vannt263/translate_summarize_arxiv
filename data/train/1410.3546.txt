    "electronic transport through a single - molecule magnet ( smm ) has been intensively studied both experimentallyheersche , jo , grose , loth , zyazin , roch , komeda , kahle , vincent , thiele and theoreticallyromeike01,romeike02,timm01,elste01,elste02,timm02,wegewijs , gonzalez01,gonzalez02,misiorny02,misiorny03,xiejap12,misiorny04,xiejap13,wangrn due to its applications in molecular spintronics@xcite , but these investigations were focused mainly on the differential conductance or average current . although the shot noise of electron transport through a smm has not yet been observed experimentally , new techniques based on carbon nanotubes have been proposed for its possible realization@xcite .",
    "recently , the current noise properties of electron transport through a smm have been attracting much theoretical research interestsromeike03,imura , misiorny01,xuejap10,xuepla , xuejap11,wangrq , aguado due to they can provide a deeper insight into the nature of transport mechanisms that can not be obtained by measuring the differential conductance or average currentblanter , nazarov .",
    "for example , the super - poissonian shot noise can be used to reveal the information about the internal level structure of the smm , the left - right asymmetry of the smm - electrode coupling@xcite , and the angle between the applied magnetic field and the smm s easy axisxuejap11 ; and distinguish the two types of different nonequilibrium dynamics mechanisms , namely , the quantum tunneling of magnetization process and the thermally excited spin relaxation@xcite . in particular , the frequency - resolved shot noise spectrum of artificial smm , e.g. , a cdte quantum dot doped with a single @xmath0 mn spin , can allow one to separately extract the hole and mn spin relaxation times via the dicke effectaguado .    among these observed or predicted characteristics , the negative differential conductance ( ndc ) is especially concerned due to the smm s potential applications in a new generation of molecule - based memory devices and logic circuits . on the other hand ,",
    "the shot noise is usually the sub - poissonian statistics in non - interacting fermion systems originating from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "thus , the super - poissonian shot noise is another important characteristic of transport current .",
    "for the smm weakly coupled to two normal metal electrodes , the ndc formation mechanism originates essentially from the non - equilibrium electron occupation of the system eigenstates entering bias voltage window@xcite , namely , the increased current magnitudes of the new opened transport channels do not compensate the decreased current magnitude(s ) of the already opened transport channel(s ) , and the shot noise in this ndc region is obviously enhanced even up to a super - poissonian shot noise value . in particular , the occurrence of super - poissonian shot noise depends on the effective competition between different transport channels , thus , the smm s internal level structure and the left - right asymmetry of the smm - electrode coupling , which can tune the smm transport channels , have an important influence on the super - poissonian shot noise properties@xcite . whereas for the smm weakly coupled to two electrodes with either one or both of them being ferromagnetic , the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes play an important role in the forming speed of the correlated smm eigenstates involved in the electron tunneling processes , and thus have a remarkable influence on the transport channels entering bias voltage window@xcite . consequently , the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes will have an significant impact on the ndc and super - poissonian shot noise properties of this smm system .",
    "however , the influences of the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes on the ndc and super - poissonian shot noise in the smm system have not yet been revealed .",
    "the goal of this report is thus to study the influences of the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes and the applied gate voltage on the ndc and super - poissonian shot noise in a smm weakly coupled to two electrodes with either one or both of them being ferromagnetic , and discuss the underlying mechanisms of the observed ndc and super - poissonian shot noise .",
    "it is demonstrated that the gate - voltage - controlled ndc and super - poissonian shot noise depend sensitively on the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes . in particular , whether the shot noise in the ndc region being enhanced or not is associated with the formation mechanism of the ndc .",
    "moreover , the skewness and kurtosis in the super - poissonian shot noise regions show the crossovers from a large positive ( negative ) to a large negative ( positive ) values , which also depend on the spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes .",
    "these observed characteristics are very interesting for a better understanding of electron transport through single - molecule magnet junctions and will allow for experimental tests in the near future .",
    "the smm junction consists of a smm weakly coupled to two electrodes , see fig .",
    "the smm is characterized by the lowest unoccupied non - degenerate molecular orbital ( lumo ) , the phenomenological giant spin @xmath1 , and the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the smm hamiltonian is thus described by @xmath2here , the first two terms depict the lumo , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the electron number operator and the coulomb repulsion between two electrons in the lumo , with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) being the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators with spin @xmath7 and energy @xmath8 ( which can be tuned by a gate voltage @xmath9 ) in the lumo .",
    "the third term describes the exchange coupling between the conduction electron spin @xmath10 in the lumo and the smm spin @xmath11 , with @xmath12 @xmath13 being the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the forth term stands for the anisotropy energy of the smm whose easy - axis is @xmath14-axis ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the last term denotes zeeman splitting . for simplicity",
    ", we assume an external magnetic field @xmath16 is applied along the easy axis of the smm .    the relaxation in the two electrodes is assumed to be sufficiently fast so that their electron distributions can be described by equilibrium fermi functions .",
    "the two electrodes are thus modeled as noninteracting fermi gases and the corresponding hamiltonians read @xmath17where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operators with energy @xmath20 , momentum @xmath21 and spin @xmath22 in @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) electrode , and the index @xmath25 denotes the majority ( minority ) spin states with the density of states @xmath26 .",
    "the electrode polarization is characterized by the orientation of the polarization vector @xmath27 and its magnitude is defined as @xmath28 . here , the polarization vectors @xmath29 ( left electrode ) and @xmath30 ( right electrode ) are parallel to the spin quantization @xmath14 axis , and spin - up @xmath31 and spin - down @xmath32 are respectively defined to be the majority spin and minority spin of the ferromagnet .",
    "the tunneling between the smm and the two electrodes are thus described by @xmath33here , for the ferromagnetic electrode case , the electronic tunneling rates depend on the conduction - electron spin , namely , @xmath34 , where the tunneling amplitudes @xmath35 and the density of the state @xmath36 are assumed to be independent of wave vector and energy , and @xmath37 ; while for the normal - metal electrode case , @xmath38 , thus , @xmath39 @xmath40",
    ".    in addition , we assume that the bias voltage is symmetrically entirely dropped at the smm - electrode tunnel junctions , i.e. , @xmath41 , which implies that the levels of the smm are independent of the applied bias voltage , and choose mev as the unit of energy . in the coulomb blockade regime , the occurrence or absence of super - poissonian shot noise is related to the sequential tunneling gap @xmath42 that being the energy difference between the ground state of charge @xmath43 and the first excited state of charge @xmath44 , and the vertical  energy gap @xmath45 between the ground state of charge @xmath43 and the first excited state of the same charge@xcite . in the present work",
    ", we only study the electron transport above the sequential tunneling threshold , namely , @xmath46 . in this bias voltage region ,",
    "the conduction electrons have sufficient energy to overcome the coulomb blockade and tunnel sequentially through the smm .",
    "it should be noted that the transport current in the coulomb blockade regime is exponentially suppressed and the co - tunneling tunneling process is dominant in the electron transport , thus , the normalized shot noise will deviate from the present results when taking co - tunneling into account .",
    "the parameters of the smm are chosen as : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we first study numerically the effects of the spin polarization of the two electrodes and the applied gate voltage on the ndc and super - poissonian shot noise in the three different electrode configurations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , namely , ( i ) the ferromagnetic lead ( source ) - smm - normal - metal lead ( drain ) ( i.e. , the f - smm - n system ) , ( ii ) the normal - metal lead ( source ) - smm - ferromagnetic lead ( drain ) ( i.e. , the n - smm - f system ) , ( iii ) the ferromagnetic lead ( source ) - smm - ferromagnetic lead ( drain ) ( i.e. , the f - smm - f system ) .",
    "for the f - smm - n system considered here , the conduction electron will tunnel into the smm from the ferromagnetic lead and then tunnel out of the smm onto the normal - metal lead .",
    "the strengths of tunneling coupling of the smm with two electrodes can be expressed as @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . since only the energy eigenvalues of singly - occupied and doubly - occupied eigenstates @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "depend on the gate voltage @xmath9 , the transition between the singly- and doubly - occupied eigenstates , or between the empty- and singly - occupied eigenstates first entering bias voltage window can be tuned by the gate voltage@xcite .",
    "for example , for a relatively small or negative gate voltage , the transition from the singly- to empty - occupied eigenstates first takes place ; while for a large enough gate voltage that from the double- to singly - occupied eigenstates first occurs .    figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) , 2(e ) and 2(f ) show the average current and shot noise as a function of the bias voltage for different gate voltages @xmath9 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for a large enough spin polarization of source electrode @xmath62 ,",
    "the super - poissonian shot noise is observed when the transition from the doubly- and singly - occupied eigenstates first participates in the electron transport with the bias voltage increasing , see the short dashed , short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in fig .",
    "2(f ) , whereas for the qd system the super - poissonian noise dose not appear@xcite .",
    "this characteristic can be understood in terms of the effective competition between fast and slow transport channelsxuejap10,xuepla , xuejap11,aghassi01,safonov , djuric , aghassi02,xueepjb , xueaip , xueaop and the forming speed of the new correlated eigenstates@xcite .",
    "the current magnitudes of the smm transport channels can be expressed astimm01,xuejap10,xuejap11@xmath63@xmath64where @xmath65 is a constant which related to the two smm eigenstates but independent of the applied bias voltage , and @xmath66 is the occupation probability of the smm eigenstate @xmath67 . here , the fermi function @xmath68 changes very slowly with increasing bias voltage above the sequential tunneling threshold , namely , @xmath69 , thus , @xmath70",
    ". the current magnitude of the smm transport channel is thus mainly determined by the occupation probability @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    in order to give a qualitative explanation for the underlying mechanism of the observed super - poissonian shot noise , we plot the occupation probabilities of the smm eigenstates as a function of bias voltage for @xmath61 and @xmath73 in fig .",
    "3 . with increasing bias voltage ,",
    "the transport channel @xmath74 begins to participate in the electron transport .",
    "when the bias voltage increases up to about 0.6 mev , the new transport channel @xmath75 enters the bias voltage window .",
    "in this situation , the conduction electron can tunnel out smm via the two transport channels @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "for the f - smm - n system , the electron tunneling between the smm and the drain electrode ( normal - metal lead ) is independent of the conduction electron spin , thus the tunneling process mainly relies on the forming speed of the new doubly - occupied eigenstate @xmath78 . in the case of @xmath79 , a new doubly - occupied eigenstate @xmath78  can be quickly formed when the spin - up electron tunnels out of the smm ; whereas for the case of the spin - down electron tunneling out of the smm ,  the forming of the corresponding new doubly - occupied eigenstate @xmath78 takes a relatively longer time .",
    "thus , for a large enough @xmath62 , the fast transport channel @xmath80 can be modulated by the correlated slow channel @xmath81 , which leads to the bunching effect of the conduction electrons being formed , and is responsible for the formation of the super - poissonian noise .",
    "when @xmath82 , the transport channels @xmath83 and @xmath84 enter the bias volatge window , so that the two successive electron tunneling processes @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be formed .",
    "consequently , the formed active competition between the fast - and - slow transport channels is suppressed even destroyed with the current magnitudes of the two new transport channels increasing , which leads to the super - poissonian shot noise being decreased and even to the sub - poissonian .",
    "we now consider the f - smm - f system , the strengths of the spin - dependent smm - electrode coupling are characterized by @xmath131 and @xmath132 , here we set @xmath133 . for a small enough or negative gate voltage and relatively large spin polarization of the source and drain electrodes @xmath134 , an obvious ndc is observed but weaker than that in the n - smm - f system , especially for a large enough spin polarization @xmath134 , see the solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 6(a ) , and 4(e ) and 6(e ) .",
    "while for a relatively large gate voltage , such as @xmath135 mev , a weak ndc can be observed for a large enough spin polarization @xmath134 , but that in the n - smm - f system does not occur .",
    "interestingly , for a small enough or negative gate voltage , the shot noise in the ndc region is dramatically enhanced and reaches up to a super - poissonian value , see the solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(f ) ; whereas for a large enough gate voltage the formed super - poissonian shot noise in the ndc region is decreased , see the short dashed , short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in fig .",
    "this characteristic depends on the formation mechanism of the ndc , which is illustrated by the examples of @xmath94 and @xmath92 with @xmath136 .    for a negative gate voltage @xmath94",
    ", the fast transport channel @xmath137 first enters the bias voltage window .",
    "when the bias voltage increases up to about @xmath138 mev , the new spin - up electron tunneling processes , namely , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and the spin - dowm electron tunneling processes , namely , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath84 begin to participate in the quantum transport , see figs .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) .",
    "this leads to the current magnitude of the fast transport channel @xmath137 decrease , but the increased current magnitudes of the new opened transport channels are too small to compensate the decreased current magnitude of @xmath147 .",
    "thus , a ndc region can form , in which the corresponding shot noise is rapidly enhanced by the active competition between the fast channel of current decreasing and the slow channels of current increasing , and reaches up to a large super - poissonian value , see the solid line in fig .",
    "6(f ) . with further increasing the bias voltage , the formed active competition between the fast channel of current decreasing and the slow channels of current increasing is weakened and even disappears , but the effective competition between the spin - up and spin - down electron tunneling processes is still valid due to @xmath148 and @xmath119 , thus , the value of the formed super - poissonian begins to continually decrease but still remains super - poissonian distribution .",
    "when the bias voltage increases up to @xmath149 mev , the current magnitudes of the transport channels originating from the transitions between the double- and singly - occupied eigenstates are already larger than that of the some transport channels originating from the transitions between the singly- and empty - occupied eigenstates , for example , @xmath150 . in this case",
    ", the formed effective competition between the fast and slow transport channels is suppressed and finally destroyed due to these transport channels via the transitions from the double- to singly - occupied eigenstates entering the bias voltage .",
    "consequently , the super - poissonian shot noise is decreased quickly up to a sub - poissonian value , see the solid line in fig .",
    "compared with the @xmath94 case , for @xmath92 the transport channel @xmath74 first participates in the quantum transport .",
    "when the bias voltage increases up to about @xmath151 mev , the spin - up transport channels @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and the spin - down transport channels @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 can be opened , while the current magnitude of the transport channel @xmath161 begin to decrease , see figs .",
    "7(c ) and 7(d ) . for the @xmath162 case ,",
    "the decreased current magnitude of the spin - down transport channel @xmath81 is smaller than the increased current magnitudes of the new opened transport channels , thus , the ndc does not appear . whereas the active competition between the fast channel of current decreasing and the slow channels of current increasing in a relatively small bias voltage range can form but soon be destroyed , so that the shot noise is significantly enhanced up to a very large super - poissonian value",
    ", then this value begins to decrease but still remains super - poissonian distribution due to the effective competition between the spin - up and spin - down electron tunneling processes being still valid , see the thick dashed line in fig .",
    "in particular , it is interesting note thatthe current magnitudes of the transport channels @xmath161 and @xmath163 increase with further increasing the bias voltage , while the current magnitudes of the other transport channels @xmath116 , @xmath130 , @xmath164 , @xmath155 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath165 decrease .",
    "this feature leads to the occurrence of a weak ndc . in this ndc bias voltage range , however , the super - poissonian shot noise value continually decreases , see the thick dashed line in fig .",
    "when the transport channels originating from the transitions from the singly- to empty - occupied eigenstates enter the bias voltage , the physical mechanism of decreasing super - poissonian shot noise is the same as the @xmath94 case , namely , the formed effective competition between the spin - up and spin - down electron tunneling processes is weakened even destroyed by these current increased transport channels .",
    "this is responsible for the super - poissonian shot noise being decreased to a sub - poissonian value .",
    "we now study the skewness and kurtosis properties of the transport current in the super - poissonian shot noise bias voltage regions .",
    "it is well known that the skewness and kurtosis ( both its magnitude and sign ) characterize , respectively , the asymmetry of and the peakedness of the probability distribution around the average transferred - electron number @xmath166 during a time interval t , thus that provide further information for the counting statistics beyond the shot noise . in the n - smm - f system with",
    "a given small enough or negative gate voltage , for a relatively large @xmath90 , the skewness shows a crossover from a large negative to a relatively small positive values , while the kurtosis shows a crossover from a large positive to a relatively small negative values , see the solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ; whereas for a large enough @xmath90 , the transition of the skewness from a large negative to a large positive values takes place and forms a fano - like resonance , see the solid , dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "4(g ) , while the transitions of the kurtosis from a large positive to a large negative values and then from the large negative to a large positive values take place , and form the double fano - like resonances , see the solid , dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "in contrast with a small enough or negative gate voltage , for a large enough gate voltage , the skewness and kurtosis for a relatively large @xmath90 show , respectively , the crossovers from a large positive to a relatively small negative values and from a small positive to a relatively large negative values , see the short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ; while for a large enough @xmath90 , the skewness and kurtosis show , respectively , the crossovers from a small positive to a relatively large negative values and from a small negative large to a relatively large positive values , see the short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in figs .",
    "4(g ) and 4(h ) , but the variations in the magnitudes of the skewness and kurtosis are much smaller than that for a small enough or negative gate voltage , see figs .",
    "4(g ) and 4(h ) . as for the f - smm - f system with a given relatively large @xmath134",
    ", the skewness for a small enough or negative gate voltage shows a large negative value , see the solid , dashed and dotted lines in figs .",
    "6(c ) and 6(g ) , whereas for a large enough gate voltage that shows a large positive value , see the short dashed , short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in figs . 6(c ) and 6(g ) ; while the kurtosis shows the double - crossover from a large positive to a relatively small negative values and then from the negative to a large positive values but the latter has a remarkable variation in the magnitude of the kurtosis , see figs .",
    "6(d ) and 6(h ) .",
    "moreover , we found that the magnitudes of the skewness and kurtosis are more sensitive to the active competition between the fast channels of current decreasing and the corresponding slow channels of current increasing than the shot noise , see the short dashed , short dash - dotted and thick dashed lines in figs . 2 , 4 and 6 .",
    "in the n - smm - f system , the strengths of tunnel coupling between the smm and the two electrodes are described by @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",

    "4(a ) and 4(e ) , especially for a large enough spin polarization @xmath90 a strong ndc takes place , see the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "moreover , the shot noise can be significantly enhanced and reaches up to a super - poissonian value when the magnitude of the total current begins to decrease , but the super - poissonian value in the ndc region is then decreased with further increasing the bias voltage , see the solid and dashed lines in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(f ) .",

    "4(b ) and 4(f ) .",
    "the observed ndc and super - poissonian shot noise characteristics can also be attributed to the mechanism of the fast - and - slow transport channels . here , we take the @xmath91 and @xmath92 cases with @xmath93 as examples to illustrate these characteristics .    for the @xmath94 case , the transition from singly - occupied to empty eigenstates @xmath83 first participates in the electron transport with increasing the bias voltage , see figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) .",
    "when the bias voltage is larger than 0.33 mev , the smm has a small probability of forming the empty - occupied eigenstate @xmath95 , see the thick solid line in fig .",
