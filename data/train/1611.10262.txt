    "blazars , in particular bl lac objects  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) , are described as extreme active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in which the relativistic jets originating close to the central massive black hole ( bh ) are pointing directly to the observer  @xcite .",
    "the highly beamed energy released by the central bh across the entire electromagnetic spectrum makes them visible at large distances , but at the same time dilutes severely any spectral feature from its host galaxy  @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently compiled the largest sample of @xmath3-ray selected bl lac objects ( blls ) with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "they used literature data and their own observations in 4 and 10 meter class telescopes resulting in successful redshift measurements for only 44% of the 475 studied blls .",
    "3fgl  j0909.0 + 2310 , also named sdss j090900.62 + 231112.9 , ( 3fgl  j0909  hereafter ) was first detected by the nrao green bank telescope  @xcite and classified as a radio - loud agn by  @xcite .",
    "the classification as a bl lac comes from high angular resolution radio images obtained with the vla of targets with detection in both the nrao green bank telescope and the rosat all - sky survey  @xcite .",
    "first attempts to obtain the redshift of 3fgl  j0909  are from @xcite who , applying a non - negative matrix factorisation method to the sdss spectrum , estimated @xmath4 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed a lower limit of @xmath5 based on the detection of the 2800   mgii doublet in the sdss spectrum which could be either intrinsic , or due to the presence of absorbers in the line of sight .",
    "3fgl  j0909  appears in gamma rays in the first catalog of point sources detected by the fermi large area telescope  ( 1fgl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a flux in the 100  mev to 100  gev range of @xmath6erg  s@xmath7@xmath8 .",

    "these observations report a hard power law ( @xmath11 ) spectral index of @xmath12 .",
    "the object is included in the first fermi - lat catalog of sources above 10 gev  ( 1fhl , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a flux of @xmath13erg  s@xmath7@xmath8 and a spectral index in the 10 - 500 gev energy range of @xmath14 .",
    "sources with hard spectral index and detected by fermi above 10 gev are targets of interest for follow up studies at very high energies ( vhe ; e @xmath15 gev ) . in particular 3fgl  j0909  has been observed by the imaging cherenkov telescopes veritas but only upper limits to the fluxes in the tev regime were obtained even after 14.2 hours of observation  @xcite . at high energies the spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "is severely affected by the diffuse extra  galactic background light and the appropriate corrections to recover the intrinsic spectral shape must be applied  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , before the sed can be compared with theoretical emission models  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all these studies a precise measurement of the redshift is required .",
    "it is generally assumed that bl lac nuclei are hosted by luminous elliptical galaxies embedded in small groups of galaxies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a close companion is usually presented as the cause of the activation of the central engine  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) however , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations of a large sample of bl lac objects have shown than only around 50% of them have a nearby companion finding also truly isolated bl lac  @xcite .",
    "most of the previous studies on bl lac environment have been performed using photometric redshifts and only in a few cases  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the environment have been characterized with spectroscopic redshifts . in this paper",
    "we report on the distance and environment of 3fgl  j0909  obtained by making use of spectroscopic redshifts gathered with the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc )  .    throughout this paper , we assume a flat cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath16 = 0.3 and h@xmath17=70 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "the observations were performed using the osiris multi object spectrograph ( mos ) installed in the nasmyth - b focus of the 10.4-m gtc under the program gtc5 - 15bmex ( pi drg ) . the observations were carried out in service mode , using the r1000r grism .",
    "the spectrum is centred at 7430   covering the range from 5100 to 10000  at a resolution of 2.62   / pixel which translates to an effective resolution measured on strong sky lines of 10.86   .",
    "targets are located at different positions along the dispersion axis , changing the actual wavelength coverage ; the common wavelength range covered by all spectra is 54009500   .",
    "the total observing time was divided in two observing blocks ( ob ) that were observed on february 6@xmath18 2016 .",
    "each ob consisted of 3 exposures of 1310 seconds on target to facilitate later removal of cosmic ray hits .",
    "the two obs were accompanied by a common set of ancillary files that included observations of g191b2b as a standard star , bias , flat - field and arc lamps . both obs were observed with air masses lower than 1.12 under @xmath19 cloud coverage and a seeing of 0.9 .",
    "the data reduction was carried out by using a new mos pipeline described in  @xcite . in short ,",
    "the code reduces every mos slit by applying the usual iraf scripts for long slit spectra . to reduce the data ,",
    "the three different target images were corrected by bias independently .",
    "then we stacked them to obtain a single spectral image where the cosmic rays were successfully removed .",
    "after that , every slitlet spectrum was calibrated in wavelength by using as a reference a he+ne+ar arc image .",
    "the dispersion solution is obtained for every single slitlet and in all the cases rms errors lower than 0.4   were found .",
    "this uncertainty produces a systematic error in the redshift calculations of @xmath20 at a wavelength of 5000 .",
    "finally the image is calibrated in flux by using a sensitivity curve obtained by the observation of g191b2b .",
    "the output of the pipeline is a 2-d spectral image calibrated both in wavelength and flux .",
    "the final signal to noise ratio around 7000 for a point source of @xmath2121 mag .",
    "( e.g. mos-35 ) , was of around 28 in agreement with the values given by the gtc exposure time calculator for a single ob .    after analyzing independently the two obs we noticed that  probably due to cloud coverage ",
    "one of them had about 40% less counts per second than the other .",
    "the poor signal to noise of this latter dataset did not allow us to search for weak absorption lines and we do not use it in the following analysis .",
    "mos allows us to obtain the spectra of several objects within an effective field of view ( fov ) of around 7@xmath22 .",
    "excluding the stars used as astrometric guides , within the mos field of view we found 71 targets brighter than @xmath2122 .",
    "we selected our targets based on the sdss images centred at the position of 3fgl  j0909 .",
    "fifty three of the selected targets are classified as galaxies by sdss , 4 of them are unclassified ( including 3fgl  j0909 ) , and the remaining 14 are classified as stars .    given the nature of our program , where we do not know the redshift of the source , the host galaxy morphological type , or other extra information about the surroundings , we tried to cover as many objects as possible in the osiris field of view taking care of the physical limitations of the mask making procedure , giving preference to those objects classified as galaxies .",
    "notice that some objects classified as stars could be distant galaxies , and in fact objects classified as stars by sdss , covered by slits 25 and 35 , turned out to be galaxies at @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ( see table  [ thetable ] ) .",
    "the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd , fig .",
    "[ fig : colormag ] ) shows the location of the sdss targets where we differentiate stars from galaxies and we marked those objects selected for spectroscopy .",
    "we cover most of the parameter space in the cmd where for sdss galaxies brighter than @xmath25=21.5 we obtain spectroscopic redshift for @xmath160% of them .",
    "figure  [ fig : slitpos ] shows partially the slit positions on top of an sdss image , where we also marked the fiducial stars used for astrometry and areas free of objects used for obtaining reliable sky spectra .",
    "the length of the slits goes from 1 to 10 and the width is fixed at 1.2 .",
    "the sdss image shows that 3fgl  j0909   in slit 21  has a nearby companion ( 3.8 apart , fig .",
    "[ fig : slitpos ] ) with unknown redshift , we placed one of our slits ( mos-20 ) on top of this source to find if it is physically associated to 3fgl  j0909 .",
    "the individual spectrum for each object was extracted from the calibrated 2-d spectral image by using the iraf task @xmath26 . in general the extraction window",
    "is centred on the peak of the continuum , however for the case of the extraction of the spectrum corresponding to 3fgl  j0909  ( mos-21 ) and keeping in mind that the emission coming from the centre is featureless , we extracted the spectrum avoiding the central pixels .",
    "after trying with different apertures we end with a final extraction window centered 3 pixels ( 0.75 ) to the west of the continuum peak and an aperture of 4 pixels ( 1 ) . based on the spatial profile of the emission around 5000  ",
    "we calculate that the central pixel contribute around  40% of the light inside the aperture .",
    "therefore by excluding that pixel from the extraction window , we improve significantly the observed equivalent widths .    in most of the cases",
    "the continuum is well detected and a 4@xmath18 order polynomial function was good enough to fit the trace along the dispersion axes . in the cases where",
    "the continuum was not well detected we used the trace solutions found for a nearby object as reference .",
    "once the 1-d individual spectra were extracted , we located by eye different spectral features .",
    "we looked for the most common lines observed in extra ",
    "galactic sources , both in absorption ( e.g. ca  ii k&h , mg band , nad ) and in emission ( e.g. hydrogen recombination lines , [ oii]@xmath273727 , [ oiii]@xmath275007 , [ nii]@xmath276583 ) .",
    "once the lines were identified in a given spectrum we fit a gaussian profile which returns the position of the peaks , the integrated flux of the different lines and the equivalent widths ( we used the iraf/@xmath28 command stroke @xmath29 ) .",
    "the peaks position was used to estimate the corresponding redshifts for each individual line .",
    "the final redshift is the median of all measured values .",
    "the error is given by the standard deviation where we have more than two lines in the spectrum , or the difference between the two redshift values when we have only two lines identified in the spectrum .",
    "the systematic error in redshift of @xmath30 due to uncertainties in the wavelength calibration described in section  [ obandred ] was added in quadrature .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts and the errors are included in table  [ thetable ] .",
    "we also included the number of lines used to estimate the redshifts and if they were found in emission or in absorption .    22 within the mos field of view .",
    "the brightest object corresponds to 3fgl  j0909  ( mos-21 ) and it is located at the top left corner of the diagram .",
    "objects classified as stars are represented by star symbols , galaxies by circles and unidentified objects by squares . in blue are the objects in the field that we did not observe . in red , green , and purple",
    "are the targets observed by us with the slit number close to the corresponding symbol .",
    "the red symbols are for objects classified as galaxies or stars , green symbols for objects not classified by sdss , which include 3fgl  j0909  and its nearby companion ( mos-20 ) and purple symbols are used for targets with sdss spectra .",

    "we marked in the bottom panel the lines used to estimate the redshift and the areas where strong sky lines are present . ]",
    "we obtain spectroscopic redshifts for 26 of the 35 observed targets . targets for which we can not extract the redshift include objects close to the slit borders and those where the signal to noise ratio was too low to obtain any spectral feature .",
    "table  [ thetable ] lists the sdss properties of the selected targets , the spectroscopic redshifts , and distance to 3fgl  j0909 .",
    "the flux calibrated spectrum of the 3fgl  j0909  host galaxy is plotted in figure  [ fig : hostspec ] ( top panel ) . around 5700   ,",
    "the spectrum has a root mean square noise of ( signal to noise ratio of ) which is a factor of 9 better than that in  @xcite and @xcite . in order to see clearly the weak absorption features ,",
    "we fit a 6@xmath18 order polynomial curve to the original spectra plus a savitzky ",
    "golay filter  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which removes very broad spectral features due to residuals produced in the sky substraction process , and therefore they are not related with any astrophysical source .",
