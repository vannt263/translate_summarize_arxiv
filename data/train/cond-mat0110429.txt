    "useful results have nonetheless been obtained by combining one - dimensional exact results with a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) approach to cope with interchain couplings @xcite .",
    "recently such a method has even been applied to frustrated quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite , yielding sensible predictions .    from the rpa formalism for the dynamical susceptibility",
    ", one can deduce estimates for non - universal quantities , such as the nel temperature @xcite , or the possible incommensurate order developing below the transition in a frustrated antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by recent progress in the ( exact ) determination of spin chain two - point correlation functions in the low - energy regime .",
    "the rpa formalism together with those exact results are able to cope with exchange anisotropy , and/or dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "this approach has been successful in the sense that it yields satisfactory results when compared to experimental measurement ( in some cases even though the interchain ratio @xmath3 is not small where @xmath4 is the exchange coupling along the easy axis ) .",
    "this owes to the fact that on one hand the ratio @xmath5 is small enough so that the collective one - dimensional excitations have a significant influence on the physics at the transition temperature ( it is always the case for high enough temperature ) , and on the other hand in the case of a cubic lattice , @xmath6 is big enough .",

    "katanin have calculated corrections to rpa for spin-1/2 quasi - one - dimensional cubic lattices @xcite .",

    "we will develop a systematic expansion and will embed the rpa formula for the dynamical susceptibility in it as a natural leading order approximation .",
    "we will be mainly concerned with lattices made of s=1/2 heisenberg spin chains . yet",

    "such an expansion has been developed by e. arrigoni @xcite for the physics of luttinger liquids .",
    "the main differences with our approach are the following .",
    "because it is at @xmath9 , he resums an infinite proper set of cumulants . on the contrary , we are at finite temperature and we will use the temperature as an additional energy scale in the disordered phase . because of this energy scale , we need not resum all of the higher cumulants to get a sensible result .",
    "but we do have to resum temperature - dependent diagrams at the level of any cumulant ( four - point correlation function for the examples given in this work ) , because we intend to use our expansion down to the critical temperature , where those diagrams contribute .    in section [ gpt ] of this paper",
    ", we expose the formal steps leading to an extended perturbative expression of the dynamical susceptibility , in terms of a self - energy of the two - spin correlation function . in section [ cfc ] , we discuss some of the results and peculiarities of this expansion .",

    "it corresponds to a pole in the dynamical susceptibility . for @xmath91",
    "no singularity is expected to appear in the rpa propagator and no problem occurs in the perturbation expansion . whereas when @xmath92 , the denominator of the propagator is negative which is tantamount to realize that subdiagrams given by an rpa line just add up to infinity .",
    "nonetheless this is an unphysical singularity which can be cured by a proper prescription as we are going to hint at .",
    "let us show how it is done in the case of the calculation of @xmath93 , the critical temperature at the next leading order like was done above when calculating @xmath94 .",
    "we may expect @xmath95 to satisfy @xmath96 and hence yield a problem .",
    "this statement is based on the fact that including the effects of the four - spin correlation functions ( in addition to the two - spin correlation functions ) amounts to take into account quantum fluctuations more precisely , as compared to merely restricting to the gaussian fluctuations of the rpa approximation . as we have seen @xmath94 depends on a singular rpa - dressed propagator .",
    "now , we will add to @xmath94 ( which sum will hence be denoted @xmath97 ) subdiagrams which would normally be appearing at higher order in the expansion .",
    "the single rpa line drawn in the diagram for @xmath94 appears now as a skeleton line in the diagram for @xmath97 . in this case",

    "the self - energy correction itself , once the obvious dimensionful prefactor has been put aside , depends on the temperature @xmath88 through the rpa propagator and depends on the ratio @xmath180 through the four - point correlation function . an iterative algorithm on @xmath181",
    "can nevertheless be used .",
    "the small parameter of the expansion close to the transition is @xmath182 .",
    "our findings are the following .",
    "the critical temperature is estimated to be @xmath183 k to be compared to the experimental result @xmath128 k. the incommensurability is estimated to be @xmath184 to be compared to the experimental result @xmath129 .",
    "this is quite remarkable since the errors for the results obtained are less than a few percent .",
    "this in return validates the rougher estimates from rpa @xcite which were already quite satisfying .",
    "it makes it improbable for the success of rpa applied to quasi - one - dimensional magnets to be merely due to chance .",
    "we have shown that recent one - dimensional exact results from integrable models and quantum field theory can be applied to one - dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnets to compute quantities such as critical nel temperatures .",
    "their computation can be made systematic in perturbation theory .",
    "on rough grounds , it can be seen as a high - temperature expansion in @xmath10 . to the next - leader order , the leading order being the random - phase approximation ,",
    "the errors committed differ by less than @xmath185 from the experimental values at least in the two cases investigated above . although those observables are non - universal , the calculation only depends on the magnetic hamiltonian , i.e. exclusively on the knowledge of the exchange couplings .",
    "even incommensurate order parameter can be accurately determined this way .",
    "at least this has be shown on the case of the frustrated compound cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 .",
    "the perturbation theory allows more generally to give a perturbative estimation of the three - dimensional dynamical susceptibility .",
