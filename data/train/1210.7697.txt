    "the theory of mbius functions in categories was initiated and developed by leroux and collaborators such as content and lemay ( see [ 1],[6],[7 ] ) , and in the same time by haigh [ 2 ] .",

    "so , mbius inversion , a useful tool in number theory , was generalized to categories via rota s theory of mbius functions .",
    "the computation of poset s mbius function has a central place in rota s theory ( [ 8 ] ) .",
