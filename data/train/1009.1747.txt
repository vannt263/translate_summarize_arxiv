    "although the properly weighted average of yields in p+p and n+n collisions would be the appropriate reference for this comparison , we consider the p+p midrapidity yield to be a good approximation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the antilambda multiplicity ( from reference  @xcite ) , also shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : c0_net - prot_comp ] . the differences between the two measurements can be traced back to different analysis methods .",

    "we identify the protons and antiprotons directly by means of their specific energy loss in the mtpcs .",

    "it is important to note here that the model calculations include also elastic scattering whereas the experimental data represent inelastic interactions only .",
    "[ fig : pp_comp_modell ] reveals significant differences between the models and the experimental data .",
    "first , urqmd  @xcite has more stopping than hsd  @xcite with a similar shape as the data , but a significantly higher yield at midrapidity .",

    "note that antiprotons were not subtracted in the 40  data , since their yield is negligibly small compared to the proton yield ( @xmath65 at midrapidity ) .",
    "overall we observe fair agreement between the hsd model calculation and the data in the rapidity region covered by the na49 measurements .",
    "larger disagreements are seen for the urqmd predictions .",
    "the differences can be attributed either to known differences between the models ( see below ) or to the deficiencies in describing proton distributions in elementary p+p interactions .",
    "the hsd  @xcite calculations describe the data always better than urqmd  @xcite calculations .",
    "these significant differences in the rapidity distributions between hsd and urqmd are due to a different definition of `` formed '' and `` unformed '' hadrons . in hsd",
    "a hadron is considered as `` formed '' only if the energy density ( in the surrounding cell ) drops below a critical value , which is taken to be 1  gev/@xmath66 in line with results from lattice qcd on the critical energy density for deconfinement .",
    "otherwise the hadron is considered as `` unformed '' and unable to interact with other hadrons until the energy density drops to the critical value .",
    "this energy density criterion is not included in urqmd which leads therefore to a substantial overestimate of the energy loss of participant nucleons in collisions in which high energy densities are reached  @xcite .    in pb+pb collisions at 158",
    "we observe a parabolic shape near to midrapidity ( @xmath67 1 ) which is similar to the one seen in inelastic p+p interactions as well as in hsd calculations .",
    "this can be explained by an exponential decrease of the proton yield towards midrapidity ( according to exp[-(@xmath68 ) , which in turn results from the approximately flat probability density distribution as a function of feynman x  @xcite . at 40",
    "the rapidity distributions are similar to those at 158  for more peripheral collisions , while they develop a double hump structure for central collisions .",
    "the normalized mid - rapidity yield increases by about 25% at 40  and 10% at 158  from the most peripheral to the most central collisions in line with findings in earlier analyses of proton yields at mid - rapidity  @xcite and recent results on hyperons  @xcite .",
    "hsd calculations reproduce this trend quantitatively .",
    "the significant differences between the proton distributions at 40  and 158  are at least partly due to the differences in experimental acceptances at the two energies .",
    "the change in shape which occurs away from midrapidity at 40  is probably also present at the higher energy , however , in a range @xmath60 which is outside the na49 acceptance . finally , the integral of the normalized net proton distributions over the measured region increases by 8% at 40  and by 5% at 158  with decreasing centrality .",
    "this is an indication that the spectrum of net protons contains nucleons not only from the nuclear overlap region specified in the glauber model ( which we call wounded nucleons ) but also from the spectator remnants .",
    "such an additional contribution to the proton spectra is confirmed in the results from the model calculations in which the coverage extends from target to beam rapidity ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:40_comp_model ] and  [ fig:158_comp_model ] ) .",
    "the origin of these `` participating spectators '' could be elastic and inelastic n+n@xmath69 and meson+n@xmath69 interactions ( n stands for nucleon ) . since there is no way to separate the `` participating '' spectator protons from the wounded nucleons in the experimental data , it is difficult to draw conclusions on nuclear stopping from the study of net proton spectral shapes in centrality selected pb+pb collisions .",
    "on the other hand this spectator contribution seems to be absent in the hyperon rapidity distributions  @xcite , thus the e.g. meson+n@xmath69 interactions are not violent enough to produce hyperons .",
    "the na49 collaboration analysed proton and antiproton spectra in 40  and 158  pb+pb reactions covering the 43.5% most central collisions . in the transverse mass spectra",
    "no strong variation with centrality is discernible , but the average @xmath55  increases by roughly 20% from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "the rapidity distributions at 158  have a common concave shape ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dndy_p_40_158]b ) which however gets shallower with increasing centrality , best seen if normalized to the number of participants as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_dndy_all_p_ap ] .",
    "the rapidity distributions at 40  on the contrary exhibit a strong centrality dependence starting with a concave or v shaped structure at large impact parameters , which turns into a symmetric double hump shape for more central collisions .",
    "the minimum at the center , which is characteristic of the concave shape , persists at all centralities .",
    "sizeable contributions from non - participants in the rapidity range @xmath70 are observed , which are probably due to secondary interactions of produced particles in spectator matter .",
    "thus rapidity loss analyses of net proton spectra in nucleus - nucleus collisions have to account for this unwanted component of the spectrum .",
    "the midrapidity yield normalized to the number of participants varies only by 10% ( 5% ) with centrality at 40  ( 158 ) reaching its maximum for the most central collisions .",
    "as expected it decreases when going from 40  to 158  ( by 25% ) .",
    "these finding may be compared to the corresponding data from ags experiment e917 extracted from reference  @xcite using reference @xcite to compute the number of participants .",
    "we find roughly a factor of two higher ( normalized ) yields at midrapidity with centrality variations of 3% , 5% , and 5% at 6 , 8 , and 10.8 , respectively .",
    "antiproton spectra could not be extracted at 40  because of lack of statistics . at 158",
    "the normalized total ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tot_mult_pbar_2 ] ) and midrapidity yields increase with impact parameter .",
    "such a behavior is expected in case absorption plays a significant role or , equivalently , the baryon rich collision system approaches chemical equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "we chose to compare our findings to the transport model calculations from the hsd and urqmd codes . although both models reproduce rapidity density distributions in p+p collisions only with significant deviations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp_comp_modell ] , hsd gives a good description of the nuclear collision data at both energies ( see upper rows in figs .",
    "[ fig:40_comp_model ] and [ fig:158_comp_model ] ) in the region covered by na49 measurements with deviations only at large rapidities .",
    "the urqmd model calculations also fit the experimental distributions fairly well , although with larger discrepancies which are most pronounced at midrapidity and in central collisions .",
