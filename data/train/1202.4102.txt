    "candidate fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states which exhibit non - abelian quasiparticle excitations have been predicted to appear in the second landau level ( ll ) for certain filling fractions .",
    "@xcite recent proposals for performing intrinsic fault - tolerant quantum computation using non - abelian anyons  @xcite have revived interest at these filling factors , and in particular on the nature of their quasiparticles excitations . at present the most promising candidate for non - abelian fqh state ( based on numerical studies  @xcite ) seems to be @xmath0 , which is thought to be described by the moore - read state@xcite or its particle - hole conjugate.@xcite experimentally , the quasiparticle charge has been measured via tunneling between opposite edge states across quantum point contacts  @xcite as well as local charge measurement,@xcite and found to be consistent with theoretical predictions expected for non - abelian quasiparticles .",
    "in particular the observation of an `` even - odd '' effect  @xcite alternating between @xmath1 and @xmath2 quasiparticles ,  @xcite as well as the recently reported phase slips@xcite in the interference pattern are suggestive of the non - abelian nature of the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "however these experiments need to be reconciled with each other , which would require detailed understanding of all aspects of the experiments .",
    "such an understanding requires careful analysis of possible complications due to edge reconstruction ,  @xcite nonequilibrium edge distributions and coupling of the edge state to bulk quasiparticles.@xcite + in light of possible complications associated with the edge , alternative approaches using _ bulk _ measurements to directly probe the non - abelian nature of the quasiparticles have been proposed .",
    "@xcite the basic idea behind them is the observation that in the presence of non - abelian quasiparticles , the system has a ground state degeneracy @xmath3 which grows exponentially with the number of quasiparticles @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the quantum dimension of the non - abelian quasiparticle .",
    "this leads to a _ temperature independent _ entropy ( except below an energy scale which is related to the coupling between quasiparticles and decays exponentially with their separation ) due to this degeneracy@xcite : @xmath7 this non - abelian or _",
    "topological _ entropy due to ground state degeneracy associated with the presence of non - abelian quasiparticles , is an important part of the total entropy : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature dependent entropy due to normal sources . at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath9 approaches zero and @xmath10 dominates @xmath11 , thereby allowing experimentalists to measure the topological entropy using probes sensitive to entropy . in particular , it was pointed out in ref .",
    "that thermopower is one of the possible probes , because it measures entropy per mobile electron under suitable conditions .",
    "in fact , the topological entropy might already be a significant contributor to thermopower measured near 5/2 in a recent experiment .",
    "@xcite we note thermopower had been measured in the quantum hall ( qh ) regime before that.@xcite +        a qh liquid can be viewed as a macroscopic condensate which has a gap for charged excitations ; in the case of a fqh liquid these quasiparticle excitations carry fractional charge and possibly non - abelian statistics .",
    "the qh condensate does not carry any entropy ; hence all the entropy must be carried by the quasiparticles . in the presence of a thermal gradient the thermal response ( which is proportional to the entropy ) can only come from the entropy carried by the quasiparticles ; this can be viewed as response to an  entropical force \" . in a thermopower measurement",
    "the application of a temperature gradient @xmath12 leads to an electric potential gradient @xmath13 , as no current is allowed to flow through the system .",
    "the thermal response must be canceled by the electric response to voltage gradient so the net current is zero . in the hall bar geometry where",
    "the thermopower measurement has been considered earlier,@xcite the electric response is dominated by the qh condensate . as a result the thermal and electric responses come from very different sources .",
    "this difference may lead to substantial _ suppression _ of the thermopower signal when disorder is present , as disorder can have a strong effect on the quasiparticles , potentially leading to their localization and thus suppressing their response to a thermal gradient . on the other hand disorder",
    "has virtually no effect on the condensate ; a very weak voltage gradient can induce sufficient current response to compensate for the thermal gradient .",
    "for this reason the quasiparticle entropy is detectable in hall bar thermopower measurement only when they are mobile , which requires somewhat elevated temperatures@xcite ( see fig . [ figone ] for an illustration of this point ) .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to point out that thermopower in a corbino setup@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] ) is a more direct and thus much better measure of quasiparticle entropy .",
    "this is because in the corbino geometry the zero - current condition that results from a cancelation of the thermal and voltage responses only applies to the _ longitudinal _ current ( or current along the radial direction ) ; there is _ no _ constraint on the hall channel current , which simply runs around the annulus .",
    "the crucial point here is that the _ longitudinal _ current ( from both thermal and voltage gradients ) comes from quasiparticles _ only _ , with no condensate or edge state contribution . as a result disorder affects the thermal and electric response _ on equal footing _ , therefore it does _ not _ suppress thermopower even in the presence of localization effects ( because we are always working at non - zero temperature , quasiparticles can still hop even if they are localized at @xmath14 ) .",
    "another way to understand this heuristically is that since the quasiparticle current is zero , there is no pinning force on them , thus the electric and entropical forces must be balanced , even in the presence of disorder . + the difference between thermopower in hall bar and corbino geometries is best illustrated by analyzing the transport equations in the presence of an electric field and a temperature gradient : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the respective charge and heat currents , @xmath18 is the applied electric field , @xmath19 is the temperature and @xmath20 are the response coefficients which are tensor quantities in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the thermopower in a hall bar geometry , which is given by the zero - current condition in both the transverse and longitudinal directions ( @xmath21 ) , is also a tensor quantity : @xmath22 it relates @xmath23 with @xmath24 through @xmath25 on the other hand in a corbino geometry setup a temperature gradient applied in the radial direction leads to a voltage gradient in the radial direction only .",
    "the thermopower which is defined by the zero - current condition in the radial direction is then given as @xmath26 which reduces to a number that depends on the longitudinal components of the electric ( @xmath27 ) and thermal ( @xmath28 ) responses _ only_. these longitudinal components are dominated by quasiparticles , and are equally affected by the presence of disorder .",
    "the condensate current , which _ only _ flows in the hall channel is in the angular direction and orthogonal to the radial component , therefore does not contribute to the thermopower measurement .",
    "+ the central result of this paper is that the corbino thermopower is ( approximately ) equal to _  entropy per quasiparticle per quasiparticle charge \" _ : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the quasiparticle charge , which is _ opposite _ for electron and hole like quasiparticles .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) can be understood heuristically as the consequence of balancing the electric force due to electric field with the  entropical force \" due to the thermal gradient experienced by the quasiparticle : @xmath31 this is valid when the quasiparticle density is sufficiently low .",
    "since the quasiparticles are _ not _ flowing , the above is expected to be valid even in the presence of disorder , and when the quasiparticles are localized at @xmath14 .",
    "+        in the following sections we explore these ideas in greater detail and use various arguments to establish eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) . by applying onsager relations in the analysis of transport equations ( [ transpeq1 ] ) and ( [ transpeq2 ] ) for the corbino geometry , we show in section ii that in the dilute quasiparticle regime eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) is valid .",
    "since the analysis is quite general and only based on the behavior of the quasiparticle contribution to the transport coefficients it should apply equally for the integer and fractional qh effects . in section",
    "iii we establish eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) for a specific model of non - interacting electrons in the integer qh regime and presence of disorder through microscopic calculation . in section",
    "iv we explore the possibility of using eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) to probe the topological entropy carried by the non - abelian quasiparticles , and measure their quantum dimension @xmath32 .",
    "we consider a qh plateau at the total filling factor @xmath33 in a corbino geometry setup . at zero temperature for a sufficiently clean and uniform sample ,",
    "quasiparticles are absent at the center of the qh plateau and the system only consists of the qh condensate . as the magnetic field @xmath34",
    "is decreased ( increased ) from its value at the center of the qh plateau @xmath35 , quasielectrons ( quasiholes ) are introduced even at zero temperature , whose numbers grow linearly with the deviation of the magnetic field @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of electrons . additional quasiparticles or quasiholes",
    "are thermally activated at finite temperature ; for sufficiently low temperature one type dominates the other ( depending on which side of the plateau one is at ) . in the following",
    "we assume that this is the case and consider the contribution to transport by either quasiparticles or quasiholes _",
    "only_. + we can split the total charge current @xmath39 , into a quasiparticle current @xmath40 and condensate current @xmath41 .",
    "the latter only flows in the hall channel and gives rise to quantized hall transport without dissipation .",
    "if the temperature of the inner and outer radii in a corbino thermopower measurement is fixed so that there is no thermal gradient , then under the application of a radial electric gradient the heat current @xmath17 , which is carried by quasiparticles only , will be proportional to the quasiparticle charge current .",
    "we can thus write @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the quasiparticle number current .",
    "the above equation ( [ peltierheat ] ) is similar to the definition of peltier heat which normally relates the heat current to total current . in our case",
    "@xmath44 relates the heat current to quasiparticle current _ only _ and hence corresponds to the heat carried by each quasiparticle . to proceed",
    "further we subtract the qh condensate contribution from the response coefficient of the electric field .",
    "as already mentioned in the previous section , only the hall channel has contributions from both the condensate and quasiparticles , therefore we can separate out the quasiparticle contribution to the hall conductivity @xmath45 via , @xmath46 whereas the longitudinal electrical conductivity @xmath47 , along with the longitudinal and off - diagonal thermal responses @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are completely dominated by the quasiparticles . in terms of the quasiparticle transport coefficients , @xmath44 can be expressed as @xmath50 from the definition ( [ peltierheat ] ) it is clear that @xmath51 corresponds to the heat carried by each quasiparticle divided by its charge . while in principle it is a tensor , we expect it to be very close to ( if not exactly ) a pure number ( or scalar ) , since @xmath52 and @xmath53 should be parallel to each other on physical ground .",
    "we thus focus on its diagonal component @xmath54 in the following . using the fact @xmath55 and by virtue of the onsager relations ,  @xcite which can be expressed for the quasiparticle contribution to the transport coefficients , @xmath56",
    "the diagonal component of the @xmath44 in the corbino geometry setup can be expressed as @xmath57 close to the center of the qh plateau the quasiparticle contributions to the transport coefficients are expected to behave as those of a hall insulator  @xcite : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which leads to @xmath60 therefore , in the dilute quasiparticle regime or close to the center of the qh plateau the off - diagonal component vanishes much faster than the longitudinal component , we can thus neglect terms involving @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pirr ] ) , which reduces to @xmath62 the above relation gives an interpretation of thermopower in the corbino geometry @xmath63 which is the _",
    "`` entropy per quasiparticle per quasiparticle charge '' _ , as advertised in eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) .",
    "notice that in the above derivation the condition for a hall insulator is not essential ; to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralresult ] ) we only require that close to the center of the qh plateau the quasiparticle contribution to off - diagonal conductivity is much smaller than the diagonal conductivity .",
    "this condition on the conductivity ( eq . [ eq : hallinsulatorbehavior])can be empirically justified for the case of qh plateaus by examining the experimentally observed relation between the hall and longitudinal resistivity,@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an order 1 constant independent of the magnetic field @xmath34 , and @xmath66 is the deviation of hall resistivity from the quantized plateau value ( due to quasiparticle contribution ) . since @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 also due to the fact that on the plateau the quantized hall conductance due to qh condensate dominates the quasiparticle contributions to the conductivity tensor , the latter is _ proportional to _ the quasiparticle contributions to the resistivity tensor , justifying eq .",

    "<S> using the onsager relation between electric and heat transport coefficients , and considering the very different roles played by the quantum hall condensate and quasiparticles in transport , we argue that near the center of a quantum hall plateau thermopower in a corbino geometry measures _  entropy per quasiparticle per quasiparticle charge\"_. this relation indicates that thermopower measurement in a corbino setup is a more direct measure of quasiparticle entropy than in a hall bar . </S>",
    "<S> treating disorder within the self - consistent born approximation , we show through an explicit microscopic calculation that this relation holds on an integer quantum hall plateau at low temperatures . applying this to non - abelian quantum hall states </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that corbino thermopower at sufficiently low temperature becomes temperature - independent , and measures the quantum dimension of non - abelian quasiparticles that determines the topological entropy they carry . </S>"
