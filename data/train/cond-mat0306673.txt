    "since the exact solution for the spin-@xmath9 quantum heisenberg chain with an inverse - square exchange @xmath10 and without an external field was found independently by haldane @xcite and shastry @xcite , only a limited lot of information has been acquired about the low - temperature properties , the existence of long - range order ( lro ) and the related critical behavior for different values of the decaying exponent @xmath11 and the dimensionality @xmath0 .",
