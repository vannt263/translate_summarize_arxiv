    "the standard model ( sm ) has been so far successful in describing the below the electroweak scale with high precision .",
    "therefore , electroweak interactions are known very well in this model .",
    "self - interactions of the gauge bosons are outcomes of the @xmath5 gauge symmetry of the sm .",
    "determination of these type of interactions plays an important role to test the non - abelian gauge symmetries of the electroweak sector . searching",
    "that kind of interactions can generate extra confirmation of the sm with a higher sensitivity or reveal some information for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "any measurement which conflicts with the sm expectations would lead to the existence of new physics .",
    "the traditional approach to investigate new physics effect to @xmath0 interactions introduces in a model independent way by means of the effective lagrangian method .",
    "the theoretical motivations of such a method would be based on the guess that at higher energy regions beyond the sm , there is a main physics which reduces to the sm at lower energy regions .",
    "such a procedure is quite general and independent of the details of the model .",
    "hence , this method is generally known model independent analysis .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath0 interaction which conserves charge and parity can be given as follows @xcite ,    @xmath6    here @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the dimensionless anomalous parameters .",
    "they are related to magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of @xmath13 boson . in the sm ,",
    "the couplings are obtained @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the tree level .",
    "the @xmath14 value is fixed for on - shell photons at tree level by electromagnetic gauge invariance to its sm value .",
    "then , the feynman rule for the anomalous vertex can be found from eq.([efl ] ) ,    @xmath17\\right)_\\rho \\nonumber \\\\ & & + eg_{\\mu\\rho}\\left(\\kappa p_3-p_1+\\frac{\\lambda}{m_w^2}[(p_2.p_3)p_1-(p_1.p_2)p_3]\\right)_\\nu \\nonumber \\\\ & & + eg_{\\nu\\rho}\\left(-\\kappa p_3+p_2-\\frac{\\lambda}{m_w^2}[(p_1.p_3)p_2-(p_1.p_2)p_3]\\right)_\\mu \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{e\\lambda}{m_w^2}(p_{2\\mu}p_{3\\nu}p_{1\\rho}-p_{3\\mu}p_{1\\nu}p_{2\\rho } )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where all of momentums are incoming the vertex .",
    "however , after the recent discovery of a new particle which is consistent with the sm higgs boson , then new physics is described in terms of a direct extension of the ordinary sm formalism ; i.e. using a linear realization of the symmetry . considering cp - conserving interactions of dimension six , eleven independent operators can be constructed . among them",
    "the three operators which do not affect the gauge boson propagators at tree - level , but give rise to deviations in the charge and parity conserving @xmath0 gauge couplings . denoting the corresponding couplings as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the @xmath0 couplings inducing effective lagrangian can be given by @xcite    @xmath21    replacing the higgs doublet field by its vacuum expectation value in the above equation , nonvanishing anomalous @xmath0 gauge couplings in eq .",
    "1 can be expressed as    @xmath22    there are a lot of phenomenological studies for @xmath23 interactions at the linear and hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "the experimental sensitivity limits on anomalous @xmath0 couplings @xmath24 and @xmath12 are obtained by the lep @xcite , tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite .",
    "the obtained results have been shown in table [ tab1 ] at 95% confidence level .",
    "the best stringent limits on anomalous @xmath0 couplings have been obtained by the lep .",
    "however , @xmath0 couplings can not be well distinguished from the @xmath25 couplings in this experiment",
    ". the constraints of the lhc bounds on anomalous couplings are significantly greater than that of the tevatron due to the higher center - of - mass energy and higher @xmath26 events .",
    "these limits are also comparable to the lep results .",
    "the linear @xmath27 collider with high energy and high luminosity can give opportunity to higher precision than the hadron collider .",
    "one of the possibilities of new type linear collider is the compact linear collider ( clic ) .",
    "clic energies span from @xmath28 to @xmath29 tev and luminosity up to @xmath30 @xmath31 and we have taken these parameters to conform with @xcite.the linear colliders may have an another option that polarized beam collisions .",
    "these type of collisions give new perspectives such as on the hadronic structure and high precision measurements on the electroweak mixing angle @xcite .",
    "beam polarization could be important role in the next linear colliders as well as rhic and hera .",
    "it is expected that @xmath32 polarization of lepton beam can be achievable at the future linear colliders @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take into account one beam can be @xmath33 polarization ( @xmath34 means that eighty of percent are right polarized ) and one beam can be -@xmath35 ( this means that sixty of percent are left polarized ) .",
    "after high energy linear colliders have been constructed , its operating modes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite are expected to be made . here",
    "real photons are obtained by compton backscattering mechanism .",
    "however , @xmath38 and @xmath39 interactions can appear spontaneously with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath36 interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 and @xmath39 collisions are more realistic than the compton backscattering procedure search for the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "these reactions occur with quasi - real photons are emitted from one ( or two ) of the lepton beams .",
    "these processes can be defined by the weizsacker - williams approximation ( wwa)@xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the virtuality of the photons are very small",
    ". therefore , scattered angels of the emitting photons from the leptons trajectory along the actual beam path should be very small .",
    "the use of the wwa provides a lot of benefits . with simple formulas ,",
    "it let to obtain simple numerical estimations @xcite .",
    "also , this method provides a facility in the experimental studies since it allows to give events number for @xmath40 process approximately through the examination of the @xmath41 scattering @xcite .",
    "moreover , these processes have a very clean experimental environment , since they have no interference with weak and strong interactions .",
    "there are many phenomenological and experimental analysis about the wwa at the lep , tevatron and lhc colliders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many studies on new physics beyond the sm using the wwa at the clic in the literature have been phenomenologically investigated .",
    "these searches involve : gauge boson self - interactions , excited neutrino , the electromagnetic moments of the tau lepton ( neutrino ) , doubly charged higgs bosons and so forth @xcite .    in this study , we search for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 processes to investigate @xmath0 anomalous couplings .",
    "one of the advantages of @xmath45 and @xmath46 processes is that they can isolate @xmath0 couplings from @xmath25 couplings in @xmath47 , @xmath48 processes .",
    "there are several terms in tree - level cross section .",
    "these are proportional to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath12 and @xmath52 additional to the sm cross section . in the effective lagrangian ,",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath51 and @xmath12 terms are different as seen from ( eq.[efl ] ) . especially , limits on @xmath12 are stronger than @xmath51 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from table [ tab1 ] obtained limits on @xmath51 from the hadron colliders are much weaker than lepton colliders .",
    "for this reason , lepton colliders open new opportunities to search these anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath25 couplings .",
    "all numerical calculations related to anomalous @xmath0 interaction vertices can be evaluated via calchep @xcite .",
    "this new model can be added five new files by hand into calchep by writing a set of pure text model files which contain all the details of the model including the properties of its particles , parameters and vertex rules .",
    "these files are lagrangian , variables , composite , constraints and particles that appearing in the model files of calchep .",
    "firstly , the anomalous @xmath0 vertices defined through the effective lagrangian given with eq .",
    "( 1 ) are replaced with sm @xmath0 vertices in lagrangian file according to the interaction vertex rules in refs .",
    "subsequently , @xmath51 , and @xmath12 couplings in this effective lagrangian are defined in variables file .",
    "other files are not be any change . finally , routine of the rules given in refs .",
    "@xcite are performed numerical calculations for the three processes including new physics beyond the sm .",
    "to obtain limits , one - parameter sensitivity analysis we take into account @xmath53 test ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the total cross section including @xmath56 and new physics , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 .",
    "we have used that only one of the anomalous coupling is non zero at any given time , while the other one anomalous coupling is taken to zero . for the total cross section of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 processes",
    ", we assume that one of the bosons decays is hadronic and the other is leptonic . for these processes , we take into account @xmath61 . for the process",
    "@xmath62 , we assume hadronic decay channel @xmath63 .",
    "we examine @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) process at the clic energies search for anomalous @xmath0 couplings . we have made analysis for both the unpolarized and polarized electron and positron . in figs.[figcsk ] and [ figcsl ]",
    ", we obtain the cross sections as functions of the anomalous couplings @xmath51 and @xmath12 for the unpolarized cases with using three center - of - mass energies @xmath67 and @xmath29 tev .",
    "the cross sections seem highly depend on the center - of - mass energies and anomalous couplings .",
    "the cross - sections have a quadratic dependence on @xmath51 and @xmath12 since new physics contribution including @xmath68 and @xmath50 terms a lot more at high energy region .",
    "therefore , although anomalous couplings are very small , the contribution proportional to the quadratic terms are not negligible .",
    "moreover the cross sections are symmetric under the sign of the anomalous couplings .",
    "therefore , the interference terms are not dominant .    for impose an idea about the effect of the unpolarized and polarized electron ( positron ) cases ,",
    "we represent the total cross sections in figs.[figcskpol1 ] and [ figcskpol2 ] as functions of @xmath69 for @xmath67 and @xmath29 tev .",
    "we take the electron beam polarization @xmath70 , positron beam polarization @xmath71 in fig.[figcskpol1 ] and @xmath72-@xmath73 , @xmath74-@xmath75 in fig.[figcskpol2 ] . in fig.[figeediagram ] , there are three diagrams at the tree level .",
    "second of these includes @xmath23 vertex and it gives the most contribution to the total cross section . for the @xmath76 and @xmath71 polarization in fig.[figcskpol1 ] ,",
    "total cross section does not change significantly .",
    "the cause of this condition is that the second diagram contribution does not notable change , first and third diagrams contribution is less than the second one to the total cross section in this polarization state . for @xmath70 and @xmath74-@xmath75 case ,",
    "contribution of the diagram which includes new physics interactions is changed too large .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figcskpol2 ] that polarization of the @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) beams strongly changes to the total cross section as a variation of @xmath51 .",
    "similar behavior for the total cross section can be seen in figs.[figcsl ] , [ figcslpol1 ] and [ figcslpol2 ] for @xmath12 anomalous coupling .    in figs.[figlimk ] and",
    "[ figliml ] , we have shown that limits on anomalous couplings for different luminosities and center - of - mass energies for the unpolarized case .",
    "we have seen from these figures that limits on the anomalous couplings are improved for increasing luminosities and center - of - mass energies .",
    "in addition to this result , our limits on @xmath79 anomalous coupling are weaker than @xmath12 coupling because of the energy dependencies of these couplings as seen from eq.[efl ] .",
    "it can be seen from figs.[figlimk ] and [ figliml ] that these limits are better with respect to the current experimental limits .",
    "we have also obtained the sensitivity limits of the anomalous couplings for different beam polarization cases .",
    "the limits obtained on @xmath79 anomalous coupling for different luminosities and center - of - mass energies with @xmath76 , @xmath80 and @xmath76 , @xmath74-@xmath75 polarizations are presented in figs.[figlimkpol1 ] and [ figlimkpol2 ] , respectively .",
    "we can notice from these figures that polarization of the leptons can improve the limits on the anomalous couplings . in figs.[figlimlpol1 ] and",
    "[ figlimlpol2 ] , limits on the @xmath12 anomalous coupling with beam polarization have been shown . here , a similiar behavior for @xmath79 coupling has been observed .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the process @xmath82 through the wwa approximation at the linear collider s energies .",
    "the @xmath83 interactions would be appropriate for examining heavy gauge boson production processes @xcite , since the incoming photon ensures us with a possibility to detect directly the self - interactions of the gauge boson .",
    "there are two feynman diagrams for the process @xmath84 as seen from the fig.[figegdiagram ] .",
    "the first diagram allows the process suitable for examining the non - abelian gauge structure of the theory since it involves a triple gauge boson vertex .",
    "an other important feature of this process is that it is sensitive both @xmath85 and @xmath86 couplings , therefore it is possible the distinguish the anomalous coupling of the photon and the neutral gauge boson @xmath87 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath84 process approaches a constant value at high energies in sm .",
    "any signal that conflicts with the sm would altered the good high energy behaviour and induce to a violation of unitarity at some energy . at clic energies",
    "these deflection are expected to be small .",
    "therefore , it will be difficult to detect this signal .",
    "however , these effects can raise up using polarized electrons .",
    "this process has been investigated for the compton backscattering photons in @xcite .",
    "we show the total cross section as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath12 anomalous couplings for three different center - of - mass energies at figs.[figcs2k ] and [ figcs2l ] . it can be seen from these figures that total cross section increases with center - of - mass energy . for @xmath51 coupling",
    ", this increment is much less than @xmath12 due to the energy dependence of the coupling .",
    "the cross section is sensitive to the sign of the @xmath51 as seen from the fig.[figcs2k ] . in the case of @xmath88 gev center of mass energy ,",
    "the cross - section is less sensitive to the sign of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we see from the in fig.[figcs2k ] that deviation of the the cross section of @xmath51 from linearity increases at higher energies . in fig.[figcs2l ] the cross section almost symmetric under the sign of the @xmath89 therefore , main contribution comes from the @xmath50 term of the cross section due to energy dependence of the @xmath12 .",
    "we also examine these couplings for polarized case .",
    "the behaviour of the cross sections are not change as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is clear from the figs.[figcs2kpol1 ] and [ figcs2lpol1 ] that the polarization ( @xmath72-@xmath73 ) enhances the cross sections according to the unpolarized case .",
    "the main reason of these results can be seen from fig.[figegdiagram ] .",
    "there are two diagrams which contribute to the process and one of them includes @xmath23 interaction vertex .",
    "this diagram gives the maximum contribution to the total cross section .",
    "for @xmath72-@xmath73 case , this contribution is dominant due to the structure of the @xmath90 vertex .",
    "we have seen from figs.[figlimk2 ] and [ figliml2 ] that limits on the anomalous couplings are improved for increasing center - of - mass energies and these limits are better than the current experimental data .",
    "we also have shown from figs.[figlimk2pol1 ] and [ figliml2pol1 ] , there is no much effect of polarization on the limits .",
    "there is another contribution to @xmath92 production via @xmath93 process with @xmath0 couplings .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath84 processes includes only @xmath29- boson interactions .",
    "also specific @xmath94 vertex is predicted in sm . that vertex contributes to @xmath91 making it a particularly important tool in searching w electromagnetic interactions . for this process , we have drawn total cross section as a function of anomalous parameters in figs.[figcsk3 ] and [ figcsl3 ] .",
    "changes according to the anomalous couplings of the cross sections are similiar to the previous processes .",
    "this process is found to be quite sensitive to anomalous couplings such as @xmath59 and @xmath84 .",
    "we have seen from figs.[figlimk3 ] and [ figliml3 ] that limits on the anomalous couplings are improved for increasing center - of - mass energies and these limits are better than the current experimental data .",
    "moreover , we have found the sensitivity limits on model parameters both for the circular electron positron collider ( cepc ) and international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the small higgs mass ( @xmath95 ) allows a circular electron positron collider ( cepc ) as a higgs factory .",
    "cepc could be achieved the cepc @xmath96 gev center of mass energy with integrated luminosity @xmath97 fb@xmath98 .",
    "ilc could be achieved @xmath88 gev center of mass energy with integrated luminosity 500 fb@xmath98 .",
    "the precision of the measurements that can be made at the these colliders make possible us to estimate at what energy new physics may detect .",
    "our results have been shown for these collider parameters in tab.[tab3 ] and tab.[tab4 ] .",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 collisions can be accomplished easily at linear colliders with no additional equipments .",
    "although the @xmath101 process gives the best limits on anomalous @xmath0 couplings , this process has disadvantage due to the including anomalous @xmath25 couplings at the tree level .",
    "especially , @xmath99 and @xmath100 collisions may provide a good opportunity to investigate purely anomalous @xmath0 couplings since it has cleaner background . in this work",

    "<S> we study the anomalous @xmath0 couplings at the compact linear collider through the processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 is the weizsacker - williams photon ) . we give the 95% confidence level limits for unpolarized and polarized electron ( positron ) beam on the anomalous couplings for various values of the integrated luminosities and center - of - mass energies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the obtained limits on the anomalous couplings through these processes can highly improve the current experimental limits . in addition , our limits with beam polarization are approximately two times better than the unpolarized case . </S>"
