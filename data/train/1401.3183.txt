    "the application of continuum functional methods to hadron physics phenomenology aims at the calculation of hadronic properties using the elementary degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this",
    "framework mesons and baryons are considered as bound states of quarks and , hence , described by two - body bethe - salpeter equations ( bses ) and three - body faddeev equations .",
    "these equations rely upon the knowledge of several qcd s green s functions which are in turn solutions of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) .",
    "the approach has the advantage that the origin of physical observables can be understood from the microscopic dynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "moreover , it is poincar covariant and is applicable at any momentum range .",
    "as is well known , however , it is impossible to carry out this program exactly and truncations of both the dses and the bound state equations must be defined .",
    "the simplest one consistent with poincar covariance as well as constraints from chiral symmetry is the rainbow - ladder truncation ( rl ) .",
    "approximations of this kind have been extensively used in hadron calculations ( see e.g. @xcite for overviews ) and turn out to be rather successful in reproducing , e.g. , ground - state masses in selected channels .",
    "there are , however , also severe limitations to the rainbow - ladder scheme .",
    "consequently , much work has been invested in the past years on its extension towards more advanced approximations of the quark - gluon interaction . on the one hand , this may be accomplished directly by devising improved _ anstze _ for the dressing functions of the quark - gluon vertex @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is promising to work with diagrammatic approximations to the vertex dse .",
    "while most studies so far concentrated on ( @xmath1-subleading ) abelian contributions to the vertex ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the impact of the @xmath1-leading , non - abelian diagram on light meson masses has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , important unquenching effects in the quark - gluon interaction may be approximated by the inclusion of hadronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this is possible , since the vertex dse can be decomposed on a diagrammatic level into terms that are already present in the quenched theory and those involving explicit quark - loops .",
    "the latter ones can be expressed involving hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "to leading order in the hadron masses , pion exchange between quarks is dominating these contributions .",
    "these pions are not elementary fields .",
    "consequently , their wave functions need to be determined from their bethe - salpeter equation",
    ".    having explicit hadronic degrees of freedom in the system may also be very beneficial for phenomenological applications of the approach .",
    "pion cloud effects are expected to play an important role in the low momentum behavior of form factors and hadronic decay processes of baryons @xcite .",
    "within the covariant bse - approach , the influence of pion back - coupling effects in the mass and decay constants of the pion itself and other light mesons has been studied in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we take this framework one step further and extend it to the covariant three - body calculations of nucleon and delta masses @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section [ sec : framework ] we review the main elements of the dse / bse framework and define the truncations and model used in this work .",
    "we present and discuss the results of our calculations in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the mass and internal structure of baryons are given , in a covariant faddeev approach , by the solutions of the three - body equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the three- and two - body interaction kernels , respectively , and @xmath5 represents the product of three fully - dressed quark propagators @xmath6 .",
    "we used here a compact notation where indices have been omitted and we assume that discrete and continuous variables are summed or integrated over , respectively .",
    "the spin - momentum part of the full amplitude @xmath7 depends on the total and two relative momenta of the three valence quarks inside the baryon . as discussed in more detail in section [ subsec : internal_composition ] , this amplitude contains all possible spin and orbital angular momentum contributions .",
    "the quark propagators are obtained from their respective dse @xmath8 where the integration over the four - momentum @xmath9 is abbreviated by @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ( renormalized ) bare propagator with its inverse given by @xmath12 with bare quark mass @xmath13 , whereas @xmath14 denotes the inverse dressed propagator .",
    "the renormalisation point invariant running quark mass @xmath15 is defined by the ratio of the scalar quark dressing function @xmath16 and the vector dressing function @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the full quark - gluon vertex with its bare counterpart @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the full gluon propagator and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are renormalization constants .    to solve the system formed by equations ( [ eq:3bbsecompact ] ) and ( [ eq : quarkdse ] ) one needs to know the interaction kernels and the full quark - gluon vertex .",
    "the latter could in principle be obtained from the infinite system of coupled dses of qcd . in practice , however , this system has to be truncated into something manageable , which implies that educated _ anstze _ have to be used for the green s functions one is not solving for .",
    "the interaction kernels , in contrast , do not appear directly in the system of qcd s dses . in the quark - antiquark channel ,",
    "a connection of those with the quark - gluon interaction is established via the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity , which ensures the correct implementation of chiral symmetry in the bound state equations @xcite . in turn , it is natural from a systematic point of view to treat the interaction kernels in the quark - quark channels on a similar approximation level , such that both kernels are fixed once the approximation of the quark - gluon interaction is specified .",
    "this will be detailed below .",
    "the simplest and most commonly used ansatz for the quark - gluon and quark - quark interactions is the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation . here",
    ", only the tree - level flavor , color and lorentz structures are kept for the quark - gluon vertex , so that the quark dse reads @xmath24 with momentum @xmath25 and kernel @xmath26 here @xmath23 denotes the quark renormalization constant , @xmath27 the transverse projector @xmath28 and @xmath29 the resulting color factor for quarks in fundamental representation .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath30 combines the non - perturbative dressing of the gluon propagator and the @xmath31-structure of the vertex . at large momenta",
    ", it is constrained by perturbation theory , whereas at low momenta we have to supply a model . in this work",
    "we use the model proposed in @xcite    [ eq : mtmodel ] _ ( q^2 ) = & ^7()^2 e^-^2 + & + ,    where for the anomalous dimension we use @xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath33 flavors and @xmath34 colors .",
    "we fix the qcd scale to @xmath35 gev and the scale @xmath36  gev is introduced for technical reasons and has no impact on the results .",
    "the interaction strength is characterized by an energy scale @xmath37 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath38 controls the width of the interaction .",
    "they have to be fixed by experimental input , see section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the quark - antiquark kernel in the pion bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) has to match the interaction model in the quark - dse such as to guarantee the goldstone - boson property of the pion in the chiral limit .",
    "this is encoded in the axialvector ward - takahashi identity ( axwti ) . in the rainbow - ladder truncation ,",
    "the quark - antiquark kernel in the bse is then also given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rlkernel ] ) . the corresponding kernel describing the interaction between two quarks can be obtained via crossing symmetry . for our rainbow - ladder scheme",
    "this results in the same expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : rlkernel ] ) with modified color factor @xmath39 . for diquarks ,",
    "such a kernel together with its extensions has been explored e.g. in @xcite , whereas in the context of the three - body faddeev equations first results have been reported in @xcite . in the latter studies ,",
    "the three - body irreducible interactions between the three quarks have been neglected .",
    "we adopt the same framework in this work .",
    "the three - body faddeev - equation then reduces to    [ eq : faddeev_eq ] & _ ( p , q , p ) =   + _ k & ,    where the generic index @xmath40 in @xmath7 refers to the bound state and the first three greek indices refer to the valence quarks @xcite .",
    "the faddeev amplitudes depend on the total baryon momentum @xmath41 and two relative momenta @xmath42 and @xmath9 @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the quark momenta and @xmath47 a free momentum partitioning parameter , which is chosen to be @xmath48 for numerical convenience .",
    "the quark propagators depend on the internal quark momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the gluon momentum .",
    "similarly , the internal relative momenta @xmath52 for each of the three terms in the faddeev equation are @xmath53      as discussed above , in this work we follow the framework of refs .",
    "we will briefly summarize the approximation scheme here , referring the reader to the original work for all technical details .",
    "there , the dyson - schwinger equation for the quark - gluon vertex has been analyzed in detail and terms representing ( off - shell ) hadronic contributions to the full vertex have been identified . to leading order in a @xmath1-expansion and in the mass of the exchanged hadrons ,",
    "the dominant effect is that of the exchange of one pion .",
    "once this contribution to the vertex is inserted into the quark - dse , the resulting two - loop diagram has been approximated by the one - loop graph shown on the right hand side of the quark - dse in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_with_pion ] : besides the well - known rainbow - ladder gluonic part of the quark - dse a diagram representing the emission and subsequent absorption of a pion has appeared . here",
    ", the coupling of the pion to the quark is given by a bare pseudoscalar vertex and a full pion bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "note , however , that in general also the choice of two dressed vertices is possible and it is not clear a priori , which of the two choices is the better approximation of the original two - loop diagram . in @xcite the choice with one bare vertex led to satisfactory results in the vector - meson sector and we will therefore adopt this also here .    the quark - dse then reads @xmath54 with the rainbow - ladder kernel @xmath55 from the previous section and with the additional kernel for the quark - pion interaction given by @xmath56_{\\alpha\\alpha'}\\left(\\frac{l_1+l_2}{2};p\\right )        [ z_2 \\tau^j \\gamma_5]_{\\beta\\beta ' }         d_{\\pi}(p ) \\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac{1}{2 }        [ z_2 \\tau^j \\gamma_5]_{\\alpha\\alpha ' }        [ \\gamma^j_{\\pi}]_{\\beta\\beta'}\\left ( \\frac{l_3+l_4}{2};p\\right )",

    "the pion propagator is given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the bare pion - quark vertex .",
    "the pion bethe - salpeter amplitude as obtained from its bse is given by @xmath61 h_\\pi(p;p)\\right]\\,.\\label{eq : pseu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in principle , the back - coupling of the pion onto the quark is also governed by this amplitude and thus one needs to solve the coupled system of the quark - dse and pion - bse . in order to simplify this tremendous numerical task we only employ the leading amplitude @xmath62 for the internal pion and neglect contributions from @xmath63 and @xmath64 . from a comparison of the relative size of these amplitudes we estimate a total error of less than five percent due to this approximation . for the external pion amplitude in its bse",
    "we determine all four tensor components in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseu ] ) without further approximations .",
    "the pion - exchange part of the interaction kernel represents an explicit unquenching effect in the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "it is clear that the problem of determining the remaining parts of the vertex as well as the fully dressed gluon propagator remains .",
    "this is an ongoing effort with much progress in recent years . on the level of the faddeev equation ,",
    "however , the numerical effort involved in beyond - rainbow - ladder calculations is extremely large , so that so far no such study is available .",
    "we therefore also resort to a rainbow - ladder kernel representing the remaining parts of the interaction .",
    "the resulting three - body equation ( [ eq : faddeev_eq ] ) is formally still of ladder type when the pion exchange is included and explicitly given by    [ eq : faddeev_eq_pi ] & _ ( p , q , p ) =   + _ k & ,    with @xmath65 .",
    "the elements needed for the equation are the solutions of the system of equations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_with_pion ] . in order to numerically solve the coupled system of equations for the quark dse and pion bse as well as the faddeev equation we use standard numerical methods .",
    "in particular we employ a cauchy - contour method to solve the dse and bses for the complex momenta needed in the faddeev - equation .",
    "a couple of comments on the pion - exchange kernel are in order .",
    "first , we wish to emphasize that the complete interaction kernel consisting of the rainbow - ladder gluonic diagram and the pion exchange diagram does satisfy the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "this can be demonstrated analytically @xcite and holds even with the approximation of the exchanged pion s bethe - salpeter amplitude introduced above .",
    "as a result , using this interaction kernel one obtains a pseudoscalar goldstone boson in the chiral limit ( from the pion bethe - salpeter equation ) and the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation holds at the physical point @xcite .",
    "second , note that the pion exchange contribution originally arises as an approximation of hadronic contributions to the quark - antiquark interaction in the quark - gluon vertex @xcite .",
    "these contributions are off - shell .",
    "consequently , their large momentum behavior is not correctly represented by the on - shell - approximation used in our pion kernel .",
    "anstze _ for the off - shell continuation have been explored in the literature , see e.g. the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of hadronic contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "while these _ anstze _ may give some guidance , they are not unique and a satisfactory solution of this problem involves solving the full four - body t - matrix .",
    "this is left for future work . since in this work",
    "we are mainly interested in the low - momentum behavior of the kernel , where the on - shell approximation is expected to be good , we remain within the on - shell approach framework of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , note that the interaction kernel eq .",
    "( [ eq : pikernel ] ) is not the full story in terms of diagrams .",
    "if the kernel were derived by the usual cutting of diagrams procedure as e.g. in a 2pi approach @xcite , a diagram would appear containing two internal pions .",
    "such a diagram contains the important physics of opening up two - pion decay channels for certain kinematics , relevant for example in the vector - meson sector . at present",
    "the resulting two - loop diagrams in the quark - antiquark interaction have not been addressed in the dse / bse approach due to the numerical complexity involved .",
    "instead , in @xcite the simpler one - pion exchange kernel has been devised together with an appropriate choice of momentum arguments in the internal pion s bethe - salpeter amplitudes such that the ladder exchange kernel satisfies the axwti . while a more complete approach finally has to deal with the two - loop diagram , in this exploratory calculation we will resort to the ladder contribution only .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an observable effect of the slope of the mass - evolution curve close to the physical point is given by the nucleon and delta sigma terms . in our approach , these are trivially obtained using the feynman - hellman theorem @xmath66[eq : sigma_terms ] where @xmath13 is the current - quark mass , @xmath67 is the baryon mass and the derivative is taken at the physical quark mass . for the nucleon we obtain @xmath68 for rl1 , rl2 without and rl2 with pion exchange , respectively .",
    "likewise , we obtain for the delta @xmath69 for the pion - nucleon case both of our values using physical parameters ( rl1 and rl2+@xmath70 ) are slightly below the lower bound of a range of recent lattice results @xcite . from a comparison of the quark core calculation",
    "rl2 with rl2+@xmath70 we infer that about twenty percent of the nucleon sigma term are generated by pion cloud effects . for the @xmath0",
    "this fraction is considerably smaller and our results in general are about 30 % lower than available model results @xcite .    within certain limits , the slope can be influenced by the choice of the model parameters as reflected in the numbers in brackets given in ( [ fh1 ] ) and ( [ fh2 ] ) .",
    "however , as mentioned above , in order to study the mass evolution of the system and the resulting sigma - terms in more detail , one should include the effects of the gluon self - interaction in the two - body and three - body correlations , since these may have a significant impact @xcite .",
    "in addition , an improvement of the pion - exchange kernel by including terms with two - pion intermediate states ( as discussed at the end of section [ subsec : pion_exchange ] may have a material impact on the slope close to the physical point and therefore result in substantial changes in the sigma terms .",
    "some insight into the internal structure of the baryon can be gained by studying the relative importance of the different partial - wave sectors .",
    "as shown in @xcite , poincar covariance enforces that in our framework baryons are composed , in principle , by s- , p- and d - wave components for spin-@xmath71 particles and s- , p- , d- and f - wave components for spin-@xmath72 particles .",
    "therefore , one _ can not _ restrict the partial - wave composition in a covariant way and it is the dynamics what dictates the contribution of these components to a given state .",
    "moreover , in the case of the nucleon , the flavor part of the faddeev amplitude contains a mixed - symmetric and a mixed - antisymmetric term , as dictated by symmetry .",
    "each of these is accompanied by a spin - momentum part ; these are not identical but related to each other . in our calculation",
    "we take all these contributions into account .",
    "form factors are observables which are expected to be more sensitive to the internal structure of the baryon . in particular , the @xmath73 transition @xcite as well as the electromagnetic @xmath0-baryon form factors @xcite show a qualitatively different behavior when the angular - momentum content is artificially restricted . for this reason ,",
    "we have calculated the contribution of the different partial - wave sectors to the normalization of the @xmath74 and @xmath0 amplitudes when the pion corrections are or are not included , see table [ tab : partialwavecontributions ] . in the case of the nucleon",
    "we average the contributions from the mixed - symmetric and mixed - antisymmetric terms .",
    "the angular - momentum composition of the state is not , nevertheless , the only element determining the form factors .",
    "the coupling of the photon ( in case of electromagnetic form factors ) and pion cloud plays an important role and is likely to be the dominant correction for , e.g. , the baryon s charge radius and magnetic moment .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of this work .    accepting the aforementioned caveats , it is nevertheless interesting to discuss the internal structure of the nucleon and @xmath0 displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : partialwavecontributions ] .",
    "let us begin by analyzing the nucleon results . from comparison of our three setups",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of pion cloud effects induce only slight but potentially significant changes in the angular - momentum content of the nucleon .",
    "these are , however , not induced directly by the pion exchange term ( cp .",
    "rl2 with rl2+@xmath70 ) , but by the accompanying change in the interaction scale of the core rainbow - ladder contribution . in coordinate space",
    "this change of scale corresponds to a decrease of the core size , resulting in a larger s - wave component .",
    "this new balance is hardly affected by the explicit pion contributions .",
    "it remains to be seen , how this affects the form factors of the nucleon . here",
    ", possible quantitative corrections will be dictated by the direct pion - photon interaction and may be large in the magnetic moments and the neutron form factors at low momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the case of the @xmath0 is slightly different from the nucleon . also here",
    ", the main effects are generated by the modified interaction range of the core rainbow - ladder contribution .",
    "the increase of the s - wave contributions as compared to p - wave is less severe than in the nucleon case .",
    "instead , the d - wave contributions increase significantly with more than doubling their relative size as compared to pure rainbow - ladder",
    ". this might have a significant impact in those form factors that measure the deformation of the @xmath0-baryon , _",
    "i.e. _ the electric quadrupole and the magnetic octupole @xcite .",
    "especially the latter one is small and therefore may be very sensitive to changes in the baryon internal structure .",
    "in this work we included , for the first time , the explicit effects of pion cloud contributions in a description of baryons within a covariant three - body faddeev approach .",
    "previously , these effects have been studied within a diquark - quark approximation of the faddeev - equation using an njl - type interaction together with a perturbative treatment of the pion cloud effects @xcite . in this study",
    "we have improved this calculation in three aspects : we solved the genuine three - body equation , our interaction is much richer in terms of momentum dependence and we treated the pion cloud effects non - perturbatively .",
    "our approach generalizes the rainbow - ladder calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite and complements corresponding efforts in the light meson sector @xcite .",
    "we found substantial contributions of the pion cloud effects to the masses of the baryons of the order of 5 - 15 % , depending on the parameters of the underlying quark - gluon interaction .",
    "in addition , we found slight but significant changes in the structure of the baryons reflected in the relative contributions of their partial waves .",
    "we will explore the impact of these effects onto the electromagnetic as well as axial form factors of the baryons in future work .",
