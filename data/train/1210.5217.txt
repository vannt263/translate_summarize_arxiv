    "a two - component analysis of @xmath5 spectra reveals that the triggered soft - component yield is not significantly larger than that for minimum - bias collisions , and the soft - component spectrum shape may not change significantly over a range of energies .",
    "the common hard - component shape is consistent with a minimum - bias fragment distribution predicted by pqcd , and the yields are quantitatively comparable with a 200 gev analysis .",
    "we observe that a @xmath1 condition can effectively select for hard collisions , those including a ( triggered ) dijet , but two - component analysis reveals that triggered hard events include `` soft '' hadron densities @xmath304 close to the minimum - bias value for a given collision energy .",
    "there is no indication that such triggered hard events are `` central '' collisions .",
    "@xmath26 trends are simply explained in the two - component context .",
    "@xmath0 includes soft and hard contributions .",
    "as noted the soft contribution is consistent with ( but may be slightly larger than ) the measured minimum - bias @xmath305 .",
    "the hard component is consistent with minimum - bias jet - related angular correlations associated with the triggered dijet itself .",
    "the assumption that the tr excludes a triggered dijet contribution is incorrect .",
    "all dijets include a common base corresponding to the central region of the dijet on rapidity along the dijet axis ( string ) .",
    "those fragments emerge at large angular separation from the dijet axis and contribute to the tr .",
    "the observed hard component of @xmath0 might be attributed to multiple parton interactions or mpi in more - central collisions .",
    "larger minimum - bias dijet production can be generated in monte carlos by reducing the parton spectrum effective lower bound .",
    "however , parton spectrum properties are strongly constrained by minimum - bias data .",
    "the parton spectrum integral at 200 gev is approximately 2.5 mb as inferred from the @xmath4 dependence of hadron spectra and consistent with a parton spectrum _",
    "cutoff _ near 3 gev , implying a minimum - bias dijet probability of a few percent .",
    "the incidence of mpi for an imposed @xmath1 condition is small but can dominate collisions if a _ large-@xmath4 condition _ is imposed .    in conclusion",
    ", the two - component model provides a good description of the ue as well as other aspects of the final state .",
    "the status of the theoretical conjecture that mid - rapidity jet production may depend on collision centrality due to the transverse gluon distribution in the proton remains unclear .",
    "this exercise based on yields and spectra points to the need for correlation studies , especially the nonjet azimuth quadrupole , that may provide additional information about centrality .",

    "the unit - integral functions for the two - component model ( tcm ) of @xmath36 or @xmath10 spectra as reported in refs .",
