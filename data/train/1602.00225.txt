    "with growing applications on wireless networks , there is a need to provide security , along with reliability , from being eavesdropped , which can easily happen due to the broadcast nature of the wireless transmission .",
    "wyner , in his work in @xcite , showed that a message could be transmitted at a rate called secrecy rate , at which the legitimate user could decode the message reliably whereas the eavesdropper could be kept entirely ignorant .",
    "the wiretap channel model in @xcite was physically degraded and discrete memoryless .",
    "later , the work in @xcite was extended to more general broadcast channel and gaussian channel in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "subsequent extension to various multi - antenna wireless wiretap channels and the corresponding achievable secrecy rates and secrecy capacities have been reported by many authors , e.g. , @xcite .    in @xcite , secrecy capacity of",
    "a quasi - static single - antenna rayleigh fading channel in terms of outage probability has been characterized .",
    "outage probability characterization of the secrecy rate of multiple - input - single - output ( miso ) wiretap channel with artificial noise has been reported in @xcite , and that of amplify - and - forward relay channel has been reported in @xcite .",
    "motivated by the need for outage probability characterization of secrecy rate in miso wiretap channel , in this paper , we consider the transmitter optimization problem in slow fading miso wiretap channel .",
    "the source transmits a secret message intended for @xmath0 users in the presence of @xmath1 non - colluding eavesdroppers , and operates under a total power constraint .",
    "the channels between the source and all users and eavesdroppers are assumed to be slow fading . only statistical channel state information ( csi )",
    "is assumed to be known at the source . for a given code rate and secrecy rate pair of the wiretap code , denoted by @xmath2",

    "we minimize the transmit power subject to the total power constraint and satisfying the probability of the non - outage event to be greater than or equal to a desired threshold @xmath5 .",
    "we obtain the achievable ( @xmath6 ) region and the transmit beamforming vector .",
    "we note that we differ from the reported works in @xcite , which also consider multiple eavesdroppers scenario , in following aspects : @xmath7 number of users @xmath0 can be more than one , @xmath8 only statistical csi of the users channels are known , and @xmath9 channel covariance matrices of all users and eavesdroppers can be arbitrary positive semidefinite matrices .",

    "since the source is power constrained , this implies that @xmath54 in the following , we will use @xmath55 to denote the symbols in the codeword @xmath44 . since the channel is slow fading and the csi is unknown at the source @xmath28 , we define the non - outage event for a given @xmath2 pair of the wiretap code , denoted by @xmath56 , and impose the probability constraint on @xmath56 as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the non - outage probability threshold , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the link information rates between @xmath28 to @xmath32 and @xmath28 to @xmath35 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "when the source selects the target code rate and target secrecy rate pair of the wiretap code as @xmath2 , the above constraint implies that , with probability greater than or equal to @xmath58 , all @xmath32s will be able to successfully decode the transmitted message while all @xmath35s will be ignorant about the transmitted message .",
    "we also note that when the csi on all the links are known at @xmath28 , the achievability of the secrecy rate @xmath61 is shown in @xcite .",

    "we rewrite the optimization problem ( [ eqn16 ] ) into the following equivalent form : @xmath99 @xmath100 the above optimization problem is a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "however , by relaxing the @xmath101 constraint , the above problem can be solved using semidefinite programming techniques @xcite .",
