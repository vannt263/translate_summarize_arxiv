    "the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter and their isospin - asymmetry dependence at relatively low densities around and below normal nuclear matter density @xmath0 play a crucial role in predicting the properties of neutron - rich nuclei away from the nuclear stability line and heavy nuclei , such as the radius , the neutron - skin thickness and the density distribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that the neutron density distribution of neutron - rich nuclei depends sensitively on the isospin - asymmetry dependence of the equilibrium density of asymmetric nuclear matter .",

    "is expected to be extremely important for understanding many observational phenomena in nuclear astrophysics and neutron star physics  @xcite .",
    "for example , the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter is a basic input for neutron star structure model ( tov equation ) and it determines essentially the predicted mass - radius relation and maximum mass of neutron stars consisting of nucleons and leptons .",
    "the density dependence of symmetry energy at high densities determines the proton fraction in @xmath1-stable ( n , p , e,@xmath2 ) neutron star matter , and thus is decisive for understanding the cooling mechanism of neutron stars .",

    "theoretically , the eos and s.p . properties of nuclear matter can be predicted by various many - body approaches including phenomenological methods and microscopic approaches .",
    "although almost all theoretical approaches are able to reproduce the empirical value of symmetry energy at the saturation density , the discrepancy among the predicted density - dependence of symmetry energy at high densities by adopting different many - body approaches and/or by using different @xmath6 interactions has been shown to be quite large  @xcite for example , within the skyrme - hf framework , different skyrme parameters may lead to complete different and even opposite density - dependence of symmetry energy at supra - saturation density  @xcite .",

    "the absolute magnitude of the neutron - proton effective mass splitting in neutron - rich nuclear matter depends weakly on density and remains almost the same in the whole density range considered here .",
    "inclusion of the tbf rearrangement effect makes the absolute magnitude of the splitting become quite sensitive to the variation of the density . at sub - saturation densities , the tbf rearrangement effect on the splitting turns out to be fairly small . at supra - saturation densities , the effect of the tbf rearrangement leads to a reduction of the neutron - proton effective mass splitting . at high enough density ( @xmath83@xmath31 )",

    "it is generally expected that the cooling processes via neutrino emission @xcite , the magnetic properties , the properties of rotating dynamics , the post - glitch timing observations  @xcite , and the possible vertex pinning  @xcite of neutron stars are very sensitive to the presence of neutron and proton superfluid phases as well as to their pairing strength .",

    "inclusion of the tbf leads to a strong suppression of the @xmath87 proton superfluidity in neutron star matter , especially at high baryon densities .",
    "on the one hand , the tbf reduces significantly the peak value of the @xmath87 proton pairing gap by about 50% from @xmath92 0.95mev to @xmath92 0.55mev and shifts the peak to a much lower baryon density from @xmath93@xmath31 to @xmath94@xmath31 . on the other hand , inclusion of the tbf results in a remarkably shrinking of the density region for the @xmath87 proton superfluid phase to @xmath95@xmath31 . in spite of the small proton fractions in @xmath1-stable neutron star matter which correspond to small proton densities in the matter ,",
    "the above predicted tbf suppression of the @xmath87 proton superfluidity can be readily understood as follows . since",
    "proton pairs are embedded inside the medium of neutrons and protons , both the surrounding protons and neutrons contribute to the tbf renormalization of the proton - proton pair interaction . and",
    "consequently the relevant density to the tbf effect on proton pairing is the total baryon density , but not the proton one , which can be verified from fig .  [ fig11 ] that the tbf - induced reduction of the pairing gap becomes stronger at a higher total baryon density .",
