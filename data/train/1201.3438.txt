    "a fundamental question is to determine the extent to which the set of heegaard splittings of @xmath2 is determined by the sets of heegaard splittings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we analyze the relationships between these sets , assuming the gluing map @xmath4 is  sufficiently complicated , \" with respect to some measure of complexity , and the splittings under consideration are  low genus , \" in relation to this complexity .",
    "the main technical idea from which our results follow is that when @xmath0 is glued to @xmath1 by a complicated homeomorphism , the surface @xmath7 at their interface becomes a  barrier \" to all low genus _ topologically minimal _ surfaces .",
    "such surfaces are the topological analogue of geometrically minimal surfaces , and the intuition behind why @xmath7 should be a barrier to such surfaces comes from geometry . as the gluing map between @xmath0 and @xmath1 becomes more and more complicated , we see a longer and longer region of @xmath8 which is homeomorphic to @xmath9 . any minimal surface which passes through such a region must have large area , and thus by the gauss - bonnet theorem have large genus .",
    "lackenby used precisely this idea to study the behavior of heegaard genus under complicated gluings @xcite .",
    "examples of topologically minimal surfaces include _ incompressible _ , _ strongly irreducible _ , and _ criticial _ surfaces . knowing that the surface @xmath7 is a barrier to these three types of surfaces implies that all stabilizations , destabilizations , and isotopies of heegaard splittings of @xmath8 happen away from @xmath7 , i.e.  in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "the relationships between the low genus heegaard splittings of @xmath10 are completely determined by the relationships between heegaard splittings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from this",
    ", we obtain counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture , a resolution of the higher genus analogue of a conjecture of gordon , and a result about the uniqueness of expressions of heegaard splittings as amalgamations .",
    "we describe each of these presently .      given a heegaard surface @xmath11 in a 3-manifold , @xmath2",
    ", one can _ stabilize _ to obtain a splitting of higher genus by taking the connected sum of @xmath11 with the genus one splitting of @xmath12 .",
    "suppose @xmath13 and @xmath14 are heegaard surfaces in @xmath2 , where @xmath15 .",
    "it is a classical result of reidemeister @xcite and singer @xcite from 1933 that as long as @xmath13 and @xmath14 induce the same partition of the components of @xmath16 , stabilizing @xmath13 some number of times produces a stabilization of @xmath14 .",
    "just one stabilization was proved to be always sufficient in large classes of 3-manifolds , including seifert fibered spaces @xcite , most genus two 3-manifolds @xcite , @xcite , and most graph manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of examples to the contrary led to  the stabilization conjecture \" : any pair of heegaard splittings requires at most one stabilization to become equivalent .",
    "( see conjecture 7.4 in @xcite . )    in this paper we produce several families of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture ( see section [ s : counterexamples ] ) .",
    "this work was announced in december of 2007 at a workshop on _ triangulations , heegaard splittings , and hyperbolic geometry _ , at the american institute of mathematics . at the same conference another family of counter - examples to the stabilization conjecture",
    "was announced by hass , thompson , and thurston @xcite .",
    "their construction uses mainly geometric techniques .",
    "several months later johnson announced still more counter - examples @xcite .",
    "the key to the constructions of the counter - examples given in @xcite and @xcite is to use heegaard splittings formed by gluing together two handlebodies by a very complicated homeomorphism .",
    "the construction here is quite different , and our techniques lead to the resolution of several other questions about heegaard splittings , as described below .      in problem 3.91 of @xcite ,",
    "cameron gordon conjectured that the connected sum of unstabilized heegaard splittings is unstabilized .",
    "this was proved by the author in @xcite , and by scharlemann and qiu in @xcite .    given heegaard surfaces @xmath17 , schultens gave a construction of a heegaard surface in @xmath18 , called their _ amalgamation _",
    "@xcite . using this terminology",
    ", we can phrase the higher genus analogue of gordon s conjecture :    [ c : isotopyconjecture ] let @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote compact , orientable , irreducible 3-manifolds with homeomorphic , incompressible boundary .",

    "let @xmath19 be an unstabilized heegaard surface in @xmath20 .",
    "is the amalgamation of @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath2 unstabilized ?",
    "as stated , schultens and weidmann have shown the answer to this question is no @xcite . in light of their examples we refine the question by adding the hypothesis that the gluing map between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is  sufficiently complicated , \" in some suitable sense .",
    "we will postpone a precise definition of this term to section [ s : distanceboundsection ] .",
    "however , throughout this paper it will be used in such a way so that if @xmath21 is a fixed homeomorphism , then for each pseudo - anosov map @xmath22 , there exists an @xmath23 so that for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 is sufficiently complicated .",
    "unfortunately , the assumption that the gluing map of question [ c : isotopyconjecture ] is sufficiently complicated is still not a strong enough hypothesis to insure the answer is yes , as the following construction shows .",
    "if @xmath26 , then one can _ boundary - stabilize _ a heegaard surface in @xmath2 by tubing a copy of a component of @xmath27 to it @xcite .",

    "it follows from lemma [ l : amalggenus ] that @xmath455 is the same for all @xmath447 .",
    "but @xmath456 , so @xmath457 . by identical reasoning @xmath458 .",

    "we thus conclude @xmath463 , and thus @xmath464 and @xmath465 .",
    "in particular , it follows that @xmath48 is strictly less than @xmath51 .",
    "that is , there exists a ghs @xmath466 which has two thin levels isotopic to @xmath7 .",

    "it follows that there is some thin level @xmath468 of @xmath466 that is identical to @xmath469 .",
    "the other thin level of @xmath466 that is isotopic to @xmath7 we call @xmath470 .",

    "a ghs of @xmath268 is given by @xmath477 , and thus @xmath478 is a heegaard surface in a product .",

    "an example of a 3-manifold that has a weakly reducible , yet unstabilized heegaard surface which is not a minimal genus heegaard surface has been elusive . in the next corollary we use theorem [ t : highergenusgordon ] to construct manifolds that have arbitrarily many such surfaces .",

    "the manifold they construct is closed , but there is a solid torus that is a core of one of the handlebodies bounded by each heegaard surface .",
    "thus , removing this solid torus produces a manifold with torus boundary that has arbitrarily high genus strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces . )",
