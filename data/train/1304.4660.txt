    "the connection between quantum theory and general relativity is one of the most important unsolved mysteries of modern physics , a mystery exacerbated by the dearth of experiments probing the rare intersections between these two theories .",
    "one intersection between quantum effects and gravity that does offer potential for experimental tests is the question of how intrinsic spins interact with gravitational fields ( see , for example , the review @xcite ) . according to general relativity , a purely tensor theory , the intrinsic spin of a particle",
    "is unaffected by the local gravitational field @xcite . however , in extensions of general relativity based on a riemann - cartan spacetime instead of a riemann geometry , the gravitational interaction is described by a torsion tensor which can generate heretofore undetected spin - mass and spin - spin interactions @xcite .    in terms of quantum field theory phenomenology , the torsion tensor describes new scalar - pseudoscalar and vector - pseudovector gravitational interactions , corresponding , respectively , to spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons in addition to the usual spin-2 graviton associated with the tensor nature of standard gravity @xcite .",
    "new spin-1 and spin-0 partners of the usual spin-2 graviton also naturally arise in theoretical attempts to unify gravity and quantum mechanics , such as string theory and m - theory @xcite , especially in the context of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "it has recently been noted that a massless or nearly massless spin-0 component of gravity manifests as dark energy over cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar component of such a field leads to an interaction that has the nonrelativistic form @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter setting the scale of the new interaction , @xmath4 is planck s constant , @xmath5 is the intrinsic spin of the particle in units of @xmath4 , @xmath6 is the earth s gravitational field , and @xmath7 is the speed of light . if the strength of the pseudoscalar coupling is the same as that of the tensor component of gravity , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath9 in eq .   manifestly violates the equivalence principle for intrinsic spins , offering a mechanism by which a gravitational field can be distinguished from an accelerating reference frame .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath10 , gravity would violate parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetries , and the spin - gravity coupling would be a source of additional cp - violation that might explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "the possibility that gravity may violate discrete symmetries has led many authors over the past fifty years @xcite to consider the possibility of such an interaction , which would imply the existence of a gravitational dipole moment ( gdm ) @xmath11 for elementary particles .",
    "one could envision a gdm as a separation between the center of inertial mass and the center of gravitational mass by a distance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the particle mass .",
    "if the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath3 is of order unity , then the separation between the centers of inertial mass and gravitational mass is on the order of the compton wavelength .",
    "generally , theoretical models of gravity that accommodate such an interaction predict that @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , to date , the most sensitive searches @xcite for such a spin - gravity coupling have set limits @xmath15 , still an order of magnitude away from the most theoretically interesting region of parameter space .",
    "the central goal of the experiment described in the present paper is to probe spin - gravity interactions of the type described by eq .   at the @xmath16 level .",
    "there are several experimental consequences of the existence of a gdm for an elementary particle .",

    "generates a torque on spins immersed in a gravitational field , leading to spin precession about the axis of the local gravitational field with a frequency @xmath19 this spin precession not associated with the magnetic moments of the particles is the signature of the p- and t - violating spin - gravity coupling that is being searched for in our present experiment .    in principle",
    ", the effect of a spin - gravity coupling is indistinguishable from the interactions resulting from any heretofore undiscovered force - mediating pseudoscalar or vector particle . in the literature , such new interactions are commonly parameterized using the moody - wilczek formalism for spin-0 particles @xcite , recently extended by dobrescu and mocioiu to include spin-1 particles @xcite . in this context , the spin - gravity ( or spin - mass ) interaction searched for in our proposed experiment can be interpreted as a monopole - dipole coupling . in general",
    ", the monopole - dipole coupling strength can be different for different elementary particles  our proposed experiment is primarily sensitive to monopole - dipole couplings of the proton , whereas the previous best experimental limits are for neutron @xcite and electron @xcite couplings .",
    "consequently , our experiment has the potential to improve experimental constraints on monopole - dipole couplings of the proton by orders of magnitude compared to the best previous limit @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : monopole - dipole - constraints - neutron - proton ] presents a parameter exclusion plot showing existing direct experimental limits on monopole - dipole interactions of nucleons at various length scales , as well as astrophysical constraints inferred from the duration of the supernova sn 1987a neutrino burst in combination with data from searches for anomalous monopole - monopole forces @xcite .",
    "( it should be noted that there are significant uncertainties related to dense nuclear matter effects in the analysis of the sn 1987a neutrino burst @xcite . )",
    "the blue horizontal line at the bottom of the plot shows the strength of the monopole - dipole interaction corresponding to @xmath8 .",
    "the dashed red curve shows the projected sensitivity of our experiment .",
    "note that astrophysical limits for electron couplings , which are based on star cooling , are three orders of magnitude more restrictive than astrophysical limits on nucleon couplings .",
    "thus the astrophysical limits for electrons just reach the @xmath8 regime , and are comparable to the projected sensitivity of our experiment . of interest",
    "are observations that the white - dwarf luminosity function fits better with a small amount of anomalous energy loss at a level that would correspond to a pseudoscalar interaction with coupling strength corresponding to @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "we describe a dual - isotope rubidium ( rb ) comagnetometer well - suited for searching for a long - range monopole - dipole coupling between proton spins and the mass of the earth .",
    "we show that the dual - isotope rb comagnetometer as designed can achieve sufficient statistical sensitivity and rejection of known systematic errors so that present experimental limits on anomalous monopole - dipole couplings of the proton spin can be improved by orders of magnitude .",
    "the basic concept of our experiment is to use synchronous laser optical pumping to generate transverse spin polarization of rb atoms contained in an antirelaxation - coated cell @xcite , and then employ off - resonant laser light to simultaneously measure the spin precession frequencies of @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb atoms in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "the ratio of the difference between the rb precession frequencies divided by their sum , @xmath21 will be measured for a range of different magnetic fields .",
    "measurement of the ratio @xmath22 eliminates or reduces several common - mode sources of noise and systematic error .",
    "taking the difference @xmath23 between @xmath22 for @xmath20 parallel with @xmath6 and anti - parallel with @xmath6 yields a signal proportional to the spin precession frequency caused by nonmagnetic interactions . in this configuration",
    ", the valence electron spin of the rb atoms effectively serves as an accurate comagnetometer for the rb nuclear spins .",
    "our early work on this experiment is described in ref .  @xcite . in this early version of the experiment , a single linearly polarized laser beam , frequency - modulated at an integer multiple of the precession frequency , was used to measure nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) induced by the spin precession of the rb atoms @xcite .",
    "while the nmor measurements achieved our target statistical sensitivity to the rb spin precession frequencies , a subtle systematic effect involving light shifts @xcite required us to modify our experimental approach .",
    "the effect , known as alignment - to - orientation conversion , arises from the combined action of the magnetic field and optical electric field .",
    "alignment - to - orientation conversion evolves spin polarization aligned along the linear polarization axis into spin polarization oriented along the light propagation ( magnetic field ) direction .",
    "atomic spins oriented along the light propagation direction generated ellipticity of the light field which in turn produced unacceptably large light - power- and magnetic - field - dependent shifts of the spin precession frequencies . our present experiment circumvents these systematic effects by temporally separating pump and probe stages , using unmodulated probe light , and by a choice of experimental geometry where the probe beam propagates in a direction orthogonal to the magnetic field ( sec .  [ sec : systematic - effects ] ) .",
    "as noted in sec .  [ sec : intro ] , a long - range spin - mass or spin - gravity interaction can be parameterized in terms of a gdm @xmath24 via @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the `` gyro - gravitational ratio '' for the particle .",
    "the @xmath27 for rb atoms can be calculated in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the gyro - gravitational ratios for the electron and proton , respectively , using the shell model to describe the nuclei . in a given ground - state hyperfine level with total angular momentum @xmath30 ,",
    "the atomic gdm @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electron spin , @xmath34 is the nuclear spin , and @xmath35 is the nuclear gyro - gravitational ratio . in the nuclear shell model @xcite ,",
    "both rb isotopes have valence protons , and so the nuclear spin , magnetic moment , and nuclear gdm are , to a good approximation , due entirely to the proton .",
    "the nuclear gdm @xmath36 is thus given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proton spin and we have assumed , as do most theoretical models @xcite , that there is no contribution from orbital angular momentum .",

    "measuring @xmath65 yields a signal proportional only to the proton gdm : @xmath66 the first - order cancelation of the electron gdm contribution to @xmath23 is a result of the fact that we measure spin precession in the @xmath67 ground state hyperfine level for both isotopes , so electron couplings contribute in nearly identical ways to the measured values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "however , in the case of the alignment of @xmath20 parallel with or orthogonal to the light propagation direction ( represented by the wave vector @xmath112 ) , much better results can be achieved by employing nonlinear magneto - optical effects that depend on the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath112 @xcite : @xmath162 can be achieved under typical operating conditions .",
    "other systematic errors can not be sufficiently suppressed using the above experimental geometry ( for example , the gyroscopic error introduced by rotation of the earth @xcite ) . in these cases ,",
    "the experiment is arranged so that the error contributes to @xmath122 primarily as @xmath153 : @xmath163 while this geometry offers no suppression @xmath159 , the systematic uncertainty in the value of @xmath159 due to apparatus misalignment is quadratically suppressed .",
    "if @xmath159 is independently measured with sufficient accuracy , it can be subtracted from the data .",
    "the various systematic effects considered in this section are summarized in table  [ table : systematiceffects ] , which lists their estimated contribution to @xmath23 .",
    "the most significant estimated source of systematic uncertainty in our experiment is the effect of light shifts due to the residual ellipticity of the nominally linearly polarized probe beam .    ll    ' '' ''    description & @xmath23 +    ' '' ''    atomic shot - noise limit   & @xmath164 +    ' '' ''    anticipated sensitivity & @xmath165 +    ' '' ''    gyro - compass effect & @xmath166 +    ' '' ''    nuclear magnetic moments & @xmath167 +    ' '' ''    nonlinear zeeman effect & negligible +    ' '' ''    light shifts & @xmath168 +    ' '' ''    spin - exchange collisions & @xmath169 +    ' '' ''    magnetic field gradients & geometric phase   & @xmath167 +    ' '' ''    wall collisions & @xmath167 +    [ table : systematiceffects ]      because the experimental apparatus is attached to the earth , while the atomic spins are decoupled from earth s rotation , the experimental signal is sensitive to the rotation rate of the earth , @xmath170 .",
    "this effect , known as the gyro - compass effect @xcite or the spin - rotation effect @xcite , can be understood as the result of viewing an inertial system , the atomic spins , from a noninertial frame , the surface of the rotating earth .",
    "uncertainty in the magnitude of this @xmath63-odd systematic effect can be made quadratic in the misalignment of the experimental apparatus ( eq .",
    "[ eq : parallel - shift ] ) by orienting @xmath20 along the axis of earth s rotation @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "this approach has been implemented as shown in the picture at the top left of the experimental setup diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expt - setup ] ) .    including the gyro - compass effect adds a @xmath63-odd spin - precession frequency ( @xmath172 ) to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath173 describes the misalignment between earth s rotation axis @xmath174 and @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath175 the angle @xmath53 is now the resultant angle between @xmath6 and @xmath171 ( @xmath53 equals @xmath176 plus the latitude of the laboratory location , about @xmath177 , so @xmath178 ) .",
    "we can control the orientation of @xmath20 with respect to an auxiliary laser beam propagating along @xmath115 to a level of better than @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the long lever arm of the laser beam ( in combination with gps and aerial surveying ) enables alignment of the auxiliary laser beam propagation direction with @xmath171 to within @xmath180 , so that systematic uncertainty in the gyro - compass effect due apparatus misalignment is at the @xmath181 level .",
    "thus errors due to the earth s rotation can be well - controlled at our proposed level of sensitivity .",
    "although nuclear magnetic moments are a thousand times smaller than @xmath58 , their effect on the observed spin precession frequencies is clearly evident in the sample data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdm - data ] , giving rise to a slow beating visible in the time - domain signal shown in the upper plot .",
    "the nuclear magnetic moment modifies the land factors for the alkali ground state hyperfine levels @xcite : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the nuclear land factor ( @xmath184 for @xmath0rb , @xmath185 for @xmath1rb @xcite ) @xmath186 is the nuclear magneton , and @xmath187 .",
    "this creates a difference in the larmor frequencies for atoms in the two different ground state hyperfine levels @xmath188 for @xmath114 as in the data shown in fig .",

    "off - resonant synchronous optical pumping for the @xmath0rb @xmath48 state is much more efficient than that for the @xmath1rb @xmath97 state because of the smaller @xmath191 .",
    "the signal from the @xmath1rb @xmath97 state is additionally suppressed relative to the signal from the @xmath0rb @xmath48 state because the re - pump laser beam depletes the @xmath1rb @xmath97 state and the probe laser light is farther detuned from the @xmath1rb d2 @xmath96 resonance than from the @xmath0rb d2 @xmath101 resonance .",

    "fortunately , any first - order systematic effect associated with the nuclear magnetic moments manifests as a @xmath63-even systematic that is suppressed by @xmath192 in the comagnetometer signal @xmath23 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : systematic - effects - general ] .",
    "the magnetic field also mixes zeeman sublevels in different ground state hyperfine levels , leading the zeeman effect to acquire a nonlinear dependence on @xmath63 . in our experiment",
    ", the nonlinear zeeman effect manifests as a splitting of the larmor resonances @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the resonances is symmetric about the unperturbed larmor frequency and smaller than the linewidth , therefore , to leading order , it does not contribute any systematic shift to the spin precession frequencies .",
    "the energy @xmath193 of a particular ground state zeeman sublevel ( @xmath194 is the projection of @xmath30 along @xmath115 ) of an alkali atom is described by the breit - rabi formula @xcite : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the alkali atom s hyperfine structure constant and @xmath197 is the perturbation parameter given by : @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the land @xmath39-factor for the electron . the breit - rabi formula ( eq .

    "any imbalance in the population of the zeeman sublevels associated with the different resonances constitutes longitudinal spin polarization that does not contribute to the spin precession signal .",
    "therefore , in some sense , the signal amplitudes for different resonances are naturally balanced .",
    "thus the only apparent consequence of the nonlinear zeeman effect under our experimental conditions is a slight broadening of the spin precession resonances .",
    "nonetheless , measurements will be carried out at different magnetic fields to test for any magnetic - field - dependent systematic errors .",
    "the ac stark effect due to the optical electric field of the probe beam can cause light shifts of zeeman sublevels , leading to shifts of the measured precession frequencies for @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb . in general , ac",
    "stark shifts can be described in terms of scalar , vector , and tensor polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "the scalar and tensor polarizabilities are described by rank - zero and rank - two operators , and thus their effect on atoms can be modeled as a fictitious static electric field along the light polarization axis ; the vector polarizability is described by a rank - one operator , and thus can be modeled as a fictitious static magnetic field along the light propagation direction @xmath212 @xcite .    for measurement of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , it is the vector light shift in particular that causes the most significant systematic effect .",
    "although the probe beam is nominally linearly polarized and detuned far from the doppler - broadened optical resonances , vector light shifts can still arise due to residual ellipticity @xmath213 induced in the beam due to birefringence of the vapor cell walls .",
    "measurements of the probe beam polarization before and after the cell using a thorlabs pax720ir1-t polarimeter system show that @xmath213 can be made @xmath214 .",
    "the frequency shift @xmath215 associated with the vector polarizability is a @xmath63-odd systematic effect , and thus is not suppressed in the comagnetometer signal @xmath23 .",
    "however , because @xmath112 is orthogonal to @xmath20 , there is a geometric suppression according to eq .  . the quadratic correction term in eq",
    "can be neglected in our case , and we have : @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the vector light shift between adjacent zeeman sublevels ( @xmath218 ) for left - circularly polarized light along the quantization axis .",
    "@xmath217 can be estimated , for example , based on the formula from ref .",

    "therefore , based on eq .  , @xmath229 , and consequently light shifts are not expected to prevent the experiment from reaching its sensitivity target .",
    "nevertheless , data will be taken at different probe light powers to check for any systematic effects related to light shifts .",
    "the dual - isotope rb comagnetometer relies on independent measurements of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so coupling between the two isotopes through spin - exchange ( se ) collisions can produce a systematic error .",
    "however , since the experiment is carried out in a bias field of @xmath230 and @xmath231 , in the frame rotating with each isotope s precession frequency , the spin - polarization of the other isotope is time - averaged to nearly zero @xcite . nonetheless , there still appears a small se frequency shift @xcite .",
    "spin - exchange collisions tend to pull the precession frequencies toward a weighted average : se collisions that transfer atoms between ground state hyperfine levels of a single isotope reduce the measured spin precession frequency since the gyromagnetic ratios have opposite signs ; se collisions between rb isotopes shift @xmath68 to a higher frequency and @xmath69 to a lower frequency ( cross - isotope se shifts do not cancel because of the larger statistical weights of the @xmath205 hyperfine levels ) .    an estimate of the scale of the se frequency shift @xmath232 can be obtained by considering se collisions between ground state hyperfine levels of each individual isotope . under our experimental conditions , where the se collision rate @xmath233 , we have ref .",

    "another concern is the effect of magnetic field gradients which cause @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb atoms to , on a random basis , sample different magnetic fields , reducing the effectiveness of the comagnetometry scheme .",
    "field gradients are nulled using auxiliary measurements to @xmath239 in all directions @xcite .",

    "wall collisions can produce quadrupolar splittings of spin precession frequencies due interaction of atomic spins with surface electric field gradients @xcite . in our experiment",
