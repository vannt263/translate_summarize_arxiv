    "nuclei with an equal number of neutrons and protons are of a special interest in many respects .",
    "the similarity of the neutron and proton single - particle ( sp ) spin - space wave functions , in the vicinity of the chemical potentials , allows for rather interesting physical studies associated with isospin mixing , @xmath4 decays and proton - neutron correlations .",
    "such peculiar correlations are encountered in pairing properties either in the @xmath5 or @xmath6 channels .",
    "another intriguing property is the so - called wigner term in a liquid - drop approaches , corresponding to a very sharp pattern of extra stability close to @xmath7 .",

    "contrary to the situation near the neutron drip line and due to the coulomb barrier , their description in a mean - field - plus - correlations approach is not marred by the necessity of dealing accurately with the treatment of the continuum .",
    "if one is interested in specific properties of such nuclides and their neighbors ( such as the wigner term ) , it is desirable to use a description of pairing correlations which is not blurred by fluctuations of the neutron and proton numbers as is the case when using bogoliubov quasiparticle vacua as ansatz for the ground - state ( gs ) wave functions .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the mean - field and beyond - mean - field descriptions of well - deformed even - even @xmath0 nuclei lying between the doubly magic nuclei @xmath1ni and @xmath2sn .",

    "the presentation and discussion of the obtained results is organized in three steps .",
    "first , in sec .  [ res_hfbcs ] , we focus on the gs properties obtained within the hfbcs approach , and in sect .",
    "[ res_htda ] on the results obtained within the htda formalism without proton - neutron coupling in the particle - particle channel",
    ". then we carry out in sect .",
    "[ sec - pair ] a comparative study of pairing properties depending on the pairing treatment and the fitting scheme .",
    "finally we extend in sec .  [ pn_pairing ] the htda calculations so as to include the full isovector and isoscalar pairing interaction .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in the hfbcs approach we use the skyrme effective interaction in the particle - hole channel and the seniority force in the particle - particle channel , and expand the single - particle wave functions in the cylindrical harmonic - oscillator basis , as detailed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we focus in the remainder of this section on the htda approach .",
    "its purpose is to describe various nucleon correlations ( such as pairing and rpa ) on the same footing . among the many particle - hole excitations on a slater determinant vacuum ( noted here @xmath12 for a slater determinant and the letter @xmath13 for a correlated state . ] ) , pair excitations around the fermi surface play an essential role . by construction",
    "the htda approach is an extension of the tamm ",
    "dancoff approximation to higher order of particle - hole excitations , so it may be regarded as a truncated shell model .",
    "the rapidity of the convergence of the particle - hole expansion , and thus the tractability of the approach , depends on the realistic character of @xmath12 .",
    "a fast convergence is expected to be reached when the quasi - vacuum is defined self - consistently in such a way that some many - body effects of the correlations are already taken into account at the mean - field level .",
    "let us consider the effective hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the kinetic energy operator and @xmath16 an effective interaction .",
    "for the wave function @xmath17 we choose the hf solution , i.e. , the eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 where the potential @xmath20 denotes the one - body reduction of @xmath21 for @xmath17 and is self - consistently obtained from the many - body reduced density matrix @xmath22 of the correlated solution @xmath23 for the desired number of particles .",
    "we have thus @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the associated eigenenergy and @xmath26 this approach also allows to include various one - body constraints ( on the nuclear deformation for example ) in a simple way since the constraint operator can be absorbed in the definition of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition we assume here that the gs solutions possess the time - reversal , axial and parity symmetries .",
    "the quasi - vacuum @xmath17 may now serve to construct an orthonormal many - body basis in which we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath27 . in principle to build this basis we should include , besides @xmath28 , the particle - hole excitations of all orders ( from 1 to the particle number ) created on @xmath17 , noted generically @xmath29 for @xmath3-particle@xmath3-hole ( @xmath3p-@xmath3h ) excitations .",
    "the total gs wave function @xmath30 can therefore be decomposed in the following way @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote two different charge states .",
    "however practical calculations require to truncate this expansion . based on the former studies in the htda framework  @xcite",
    ", we may assume that the components of the pair - excitation type dominate in the gs solution .",
    "the set of products of slater determinants @xmath34 is an orthonormal basis of the physical space accessible to a nucleus having @xmath35 neutrons and @xmath36 protons . assuming time - reversal symmetry , the coefficients @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ mbstpn ] ) are real and , if we take @xmath23 normalized to unity , obey the relation @xmath38 it can be easily shown that the expression  ( [ mbstpn ] ) of @xmath23 ensures that @xmath23 is an eigenstate of the particle - number operator : @xmath39 , with @xmath40 . finally , to obtain the correlated ground state we diagonalize the hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) in the retained many - body basis .",
    "now , let us rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath27 as @xmath41 where the independent quasiparticle hamiltonian @xmath42 and the residual interaction @xmath43 are defined by @xmath44 it is interesting to note that these definitions give a vanishing expectation value of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the hf solution @xmath17 .",
    "the independent quasiparticle hamiltonian can also be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is equal to the energy @xmath47 of the single - particle state @xmath48 if @xmath48 is a particle state with respect to @xmath49 or equal to @xmath50 if @xmath48 is a hole state . in eq .",
    "( [ hqp ] ) , @xmath51 is the creation operator @xmath52 associated with @xmath48 if @xmath48 is a particle state or the annihilation operator @xmath53 if @xmath48 is a hole state .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath27 between two slater determinants @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the multi - particle multi - hole basis therefore takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the particle - hole excitation energy associated with @xmath58 and calculated with respect to the vacuum @xmath49 as @xmath59 where the sum runs over all the single - particle states @xmath48 contained in @xmath58 .",
    "since the residual interaction contains only one- and two - body operators , the matrix element @xmath60 vanishes when @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ by particle - hole excitations of order three or higher .",
    "it can be calculated in terms of two - body matrix elements of @xmath16 by application of the wick theorem generalized to quasi - vacua as shown in ref .",
    "since we are in a region of nuclear deformation instability ( shape coexistence ) our final results can be sensitive to the choice of the effective interaction and to the pairing treatment .",
    "this is why two parameterizations of the phenomenological skyrme interaction , namely the siii and sly4 ones are used . in the particle - particle channel",
    "a simple seniority ansatz is adopted in the bcs calculations .",
    "it is specified by the value @xmath61 of the constant pairing matrix elements between any single - particle states in the canonical basis retained in this part of the calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is adjusted to reproduce the so - called empirical pairing gaps evaluated in the 3-point or a 5-point formula @xcite .",
    "the differences between these two experimentally deduced quantities are large in this region and so are the experimental errors for nuclear masses . in addition",
    "the meaning of the pairing gap derived from finite mass differences is no longer clear in the @xmath0 case .",
    "therefore , we find it necessary to make a comparison of the results obtained in the two cases which represent stronger ( 5-point fit ) and somewhat weaker ( 3-point fit ) pairing regimes .",
    "we describe in the next subsection the fitting procedure for @xmath61 as well as the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis parameters optimization carried out in the hfbcs framework .",
    "the obtained basis parameters are then used in the htda calculations assuming that they do not differ significantly from the values that would result from an optimization in the htda approach .",
    "once the solutions corresponding to the equilibrium deformations determined in the hfbcs calculations are found , we perform perturbative htda calculations ( one diagonalization of the htda matrix is performed on top of the hfbcs calculations ) without any constraints on the deformation .",
    "since we are interested in the gs correlations of even - even nuclei , the many - body basis includes here only pair excitations , i.e. , excitations where nucleons occupying twofold kramer - degenerate hole levels are scattered into kramer - degenerate particle levels . as for the residual interaction in the htda approach , we choose a @xmath62 force whose strength is adjusted as explained in subsection  [ htda_fit ] . in this way our formalism not only retains the realistic character of self - consistent mean - field calculations , but also ensures the particle number conservation .",
    "we shall follow here the steps of bonche and collaborators @xcite and apply the bcs approximation with the seniority pairing interaction .",
    "for the sake of defining our notation and for completeness , we recall the relevant expressions involved , omitting the isospin @xmath32 index . first , the seniority antisymmetrized matrix element is given by @xmath63 with the smooth cut - off factor @xmath64}\\:.\\ ] ] here as well as in the htda case , the fermi level @xmath65 is defined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the energies of the last occupied and the first empty single - particle state , respectively ( in a pure hf picture ) , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the cut - off energy and the diffuseness parameters .",
    "the pairing gap can be expressed as @xmath71 where the state independent gap @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 with the quasiparticle energy @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) , the sum runs over all the pairs of kramer degenerate single - particle states , but in fact the cut - off factor @xmath76 suppresses the contributions of single - particle states lying at least about @xmath77 above the fermi level . from the average particle number conservation @xmath78 we can deduce the expression of the chemical potential  @xmath79 @xmath80 finally the pairing energy takes here",
    "the simple form @xmath81    we now discuss the determination of the pairing strengths @xmath82 related to the actual matrix elements @xmath83 through the following prescription @xmath84 first we approximately take into account the coulomb reduction of proton pairing by assuming that , as the hartree  fock",
    " bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations with the gogny d1s interaction tend to indicate  @xcite : @xmath85 then , for a given parameterization of the skyrme force and a given set of basis parameters ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we determine the gs deformation @xmath89 of each nucleus using a reasonable initial @xmath61-value , assumed to be the same for all the nuclei under study",
    ". then we deduce @xmath90 from a least - square fit to the experimental minimal quasiparticle energies through the 3-point and 5-point formulae  @xcite and using the same single - particle spectrum ( the one for the charge state @xmath32 corresponding to the converged solution at @xmath89 ) .",
    "we thus have to minimize the following function @xmath91_i- \\bigl[\\delta_{\\tau}^{(\\rm exp)}\\bigr]_i\\biggr)^2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes the lowest quasiparticle energy of the nucleons of type @xmath32 and @xmath93 is an index running over the @xmath94 nuclei included in the fit . with the obtained @xmath61-value",
    ", we determine the new gs deformation of each nucleus and minimize again @xmath95 to find a new @xmath61-value .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the simultaneous convergence of @xmath61 and the gs deformations @xmath96 is reached . in practice , it is necessary to scan a wide range of deformations to find the lowest local minimum of the deformation energy curve .",
    "the latter is determined using the basis parameters @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 deduced from an approximate expression for a ho potential ( see ref .",
    "this approximate optimization requires only the knowledge of @xmath100 , the optimized value of @xmath101 for a spherical solution .",
    "we carry out this study with @xmath102 , which is approximately the actual optimal value for the considered nuclei . by varying the basis parameters in the calculated ground states of all nuclei",
    ", we have checked that the optimal @xmath61-value does not change significantly .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath61 are reported in table  [ exp_eqp ] .",
    ".empirical pairing gaps deduced from the odd - even mass differences ( using the atomic mass evaluation ame2003 @xcite ) in 5-point and 3-point formulae @xcite , except for @xmath103 for which we use the nuclear mass calculated by mller and nix  @xcite .",
    "the standard estimate of the pairing gap @xmath104 is given for comparison .",
    "in the last column the experimental binding energy per nucleon is also indicated .",
    "all values are in mev.[exp_eqp ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these two measures of pairing correlations calculated in the hfbcs and htda approaches are compared separately for neutrons and protons in tables  [ tab - pair - n ] and [ tab - pair - p ] , respectively .",
    "the most striking feature is the rather tiny variations in the htda case from one nucleus to another .",
    "this is due to the resilience of the htda solutions to react on variations of the level density at the fermi surface .",
    "in contrast , it is overemphasized in the hfbcs calculations .",
    "one example of this is to be found for the protons distribution in @xmath105sr , where in the hfbcs calculations with a @xmath61-value fitted to the 3-point pairing indicator , no superfluid solution is found ( see also table  [ res_gs ] for the values of pairing gaps ) .",
    "in spite of the wide recent theoretical interest paid to the proton - neutron pairing mode , it is still uncertain what is the exact importance of its @xmath106 component",
    ". moreover , its connection with the wigner energy is not completely clarified and there are a lot of controversies about other signatures .",
    "since the @xmath106 pairing is neglected in all fits of the effective interactions in use to calculate the mean - field , this missing contribution may cause some artificial bias in the outcome . in the calculations of masses that make use of a macroscopic energy ( liquid - drop models ) ,",
    "this problem is circumvented by adding an ad hoc wigner term .",
    "it is however highly predictable that the inclusion of proton - neutron pairing correlations within a hfb approach would lead to novel features of the mean field , as for instance different deformation properties since the usual spin - triplet ( @xmath106 ) pairing mode would tend to break the axial symmetry .",
    "however , since we do not carry out self - consistent htda calculations , the mean field itself is not affected by the presence of these proton - neutron correlations .",
    "expectation values of various observables ( such as the radii and quadrupole moments ) specifying the correlated wave function have been calculated from solutions obtained after diagonalization of a full isoscalar and isovector residual interaction . for the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph",
    ", these quantities are not expected to change much in this perturbative treatment .",
    "in contrast , the change in energy brought in by the consideration of a full @xmath107 part of the interaction is expected to be more significant . in the htda framework as applied here , and as far as relative variations are concerned , the correlation energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ ecorr - def ] ) is relevant .",
    "the calculations reported in this section are performed in the 4p-4h space of pair excitations containing all new configurations that result from the coupling of neutron and proton states to produce the @xmath108 ground state ( including aligned proton - neutron pairs ) .",
    "the proton - neutron configurations considerably enlarge the dimension of the hamiltonian matrices to be computed and diagonalized ( up to @xmath109 ) . as a result ,",
    "the computing time becomes an issue .",
    "this is why we do not test here the convergence of the particle - hole expansion by going up to order 6 as we have done in the previous section .",
    "a more detailed study of the proton - neutron pair correlations in the htda approach will be given in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in addition , no evidence from previous theoretical approaches has been found for the @xmath106 collectivity . on the contrary",
    ", a rather strong quenching of the isoscalar pairing has been observed in the particular case of @xmath110-shell nuclei .",
    "it is thus likely that we only have to deal with a somewhat weak neutron - proton pairing and consequently the 4p-4h limitation should not constitute a stringent constraint .",
    "based on isospin invariance arguments we choose the strength @xmath111 for the part of the residual interaction acting on neutron - proton two - body states . since the actual @xmath106 pairing strength is unknown , in other words since one does not know what should be the data pertaining to the determination of a phenomenological such interaction , we adopt an exploratory approach by varying the ratio @xmath112 of the residual interaction in the two isospin channels from 0.5 to 2.0 by steps of 0.5 .    in table",
    "[ tab - pn ] the resulting gs deformations and radii are indicated only for three values of @xmath113 , namely 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "as expected , these quantities do not vary significantly with @xmath113 .",
    "the relative correlation energy with respect to the @xmath106 pairing mode , i.e. , the difference between the values of @xmath114 calculated with a given @xmath113 value and with @xmath115 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - corr - pn ] as a function of @xmath113 .",
    "pair correlations ( @xmath115 ) as a function of @xmath113 for all considered nuclei .",
    "the case ( a ) , respectively ( b ) , corresponds to calculations with the pairing strength adjusted through the 3-point formula , respectively 5-point formula , in the @xmath116 channel.[fig - corr - pn],title=\"fig : \" ]   pair correlations ( @xmath115 ) as a function of @xmath113 for all considered nuclei .",
    "the case ( a ) , respectively ( b ) , corresponds to calculations with the pairing strength adjusted through the 3-point formula , respectively 5-point formula , in the @xmath116 channel.[fig - corr - pn],title=\"fig : \" ]    the correlation energy induced by the @xmath106 mode is rather important for large @xmath113 values , so it is highly desirable to get some guidance on the actual value of @xmath113 .",
    "one could argue that the shell - model estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite provide a value of about @xmath117 .",
    "however , the shell - model pairing definition with only @xmath118 and @xmath119 couplings is not consistent with the htda one where the @xmath62-force in use includes all multipolarities .",
    "therefore , a systematic comparative study of pair correlations in large shell - model calculations and in the htda approach would be very helpful to better assess a realistic value of @xmath113 .",
    "finally it is important to add that the energy shift due to the @xmath106 pair correlations depends on the pairing intensity in the @xmath116 channel .",
    "indeed these pair correlations are larger when the @xmath116 pairing interaction is stronger .",
    "this suggests that , in a full treatment of these correlations , the adjustment of the pairing parameters in the @xmath116 channel should be done with proton - neutron correlations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a firm basis to study the correlations present in deformed even - even @xmath0 nuclei in the @xmath120 region .",
    "we mean , first of all , pairing correlations in the sense of cooper pair excitation of nucleons belonging to similar orbits . for these particular nuclei ,",
    "proton - neutron correlations must clearly be included in the scheme . moreover , rpa correlations should be further added . in view of the difficulties to be overcome in achieving this program ,",
    "we have undertaken here initial steps by including only proton - neutron pairing correlations in an exploratory way .",
    "since the various traditional pairing schemes often lead to a weak coupling regime , the bogoliubov vacuum ansatz for the correlated ground state is rather inadequate .",
    "this is especially true for the not - so - heavy nuclei considered here .",
    "in contrast the htda framework represents a consistent and more physical way of handling various kinds of correlations , including rpa correlations , on the same footing . in the present work ,",
    "we have chosen to use it from as good as possible hfbcs solutions with the usual pairing treatment which involves the @xmath116 channel only .",
    "we have had , therefore , to carefully study the pairing channel which includes in particular the choice of a @xmath62 interaction strength consistent with the data on atomic masses in the studied region . as a result",
    ", we have calculated some deformation properties which are naturally of paramount importance to grasp the single - particle spectroscopic properties . upon determining the htda correlated ground state ,",
    "we have shown that the diffuseness of the fermi surface is somewhat similar to what hfbcs yields but less sensitive to the fluctuations of the level density as a function of the mass number .    in the last step , where the full @xmath121 residual interaction has been considered ,",
    "we have established the feasibility of such calculations .",
    "then , we have assessed in a quantitative way how much the relative amount of @xmath5 and @xmath6 components of the residual interaction influences the correlations properties .",
    "even though in this study the @xmath122 interaction strength is the one adjusted in the absence of a @xmath121 component , it clearly appears from our results that a determination of the above ratio of isospin components is badly needed .",
    "the directions of improvement are therefore easy to perceive .",
    "first they imply a better understanding of the residual interaction .",
    "then , rpa correlations should be included in a consistent way , which is currently in progress .",
    "this work has benefited from the support by the u.s .",
    "department of energy under contract w-7405-eng-36 , from a funding obtained within the polish - french ( in2p3 ) laboratories agreement and from a fellowship of the french embassy at warsaw to support the co - sponsored thesis work of one of us ( k.s . ) .",
    "these organizations are gratefully acknowledged .      in the hfbcs case",
