    "the structure of the @xmath6-nucleon scattering amplitude close to threshold ( @xmath12 = 1.486 gev ) is of much interest because it appears dominated by the presence of a baryon resonance slightly above threshold , the n*@xmath13(1535 ) .",
    "the width of the n*(1535 ) is of the order of 150 mev .",
    "its two main decay channels are the n@xmath14 ( 35 - 55 @xmath15 ) and the n@xmath6 ( 30 - 55 @xmath15 ) final states @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-nucleon scattering length , @xmath16 , characterizes the behaviour of the @xmath6-nucleon interaction at threshold .",
    "it is a complex quantity whose real part is still poorly determined .",
    "we refer to the recent work of green and wycech @xcite for a discussion of the range of values found in the literature ( from @xmath17 0.3 to @xmath171 fm ) .",
    "the main reason for the spread in values is that @xmath16 is obtained indirectly and through model - dependent analyses of pion- and photon - induced @xmath6 production reactions .",
    "the @xmath6-nucleon scattering length is a key quantity to assess the possibility of forming @xmath6-nuclear quasi - bound states @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose to study the threshold behaviour of the @xmath6-nucleon scattering amplitude through the @xmath18 reaction in the particular kinematics where the invariant mass of the @xmath19 pair is close to the n*(1535 ) mass .",
    "we tune the incident laboratory photon energy in order to reach low momentum transfers , i.e. a sufficiently small @xmath20 . at the @xmath4 threshold ,",
    "@xmath21=3 gev and @xmath20 is 1.2 gev@xmath22 .",
    "we will consider values of @xmath21 ranging from 4 to 5 gev . at @xmath21=4 gev , @xmath20 is 0.38 gev@xmath22 . at 5 gev , it is 0.26 gev@xmath22 .",
    "our main argument is that the @xmath18 process in these kinematics ( @xmath23 1 gev@xmath22 ) is dominated by the @xmath6 t - channel exchange and offers the possibility to test the @xmath6-nucleon scattering amplitude close to threshold .",
    "both @xmath14- and @xmath6-exchanges can contribute .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath6-exchange in the t - channel comes mainly from the property that the @xmath4-meson radiative decay probability to the @xmath24 channel is an order of magnitude larger than to the @xmath25 channel ( despite the larger phase space available for the latter decay ) .",
    "this is ultimately related to the large @xmath26 content of the @xmath6-meson .",
    "the s - wave @xmath27 amplitude is also significantly smaller than the @xmath28 amplitude .",
    "our results on the @xmath18 reaction are based on @xmath27 and @xmath28 scattering amplitudes obtained in the unitary coupled - channel model of ref .",
    "these amplitudes reproduce a large set of pion - nucleon and photon - nucleon scattering data in the energy range @xmath29 gev , in particular the pion- and photon - induced @xmath6-meson production cross sections .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath16 is ( 1.03 + i 0.49 ) fm @xcite , in close agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our t - channel calculation of the @xmath18 reaction cross section in the n*(1535 ) region is described in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the @xmath6- and @xmath5-exchanges and their interference .",
    "the latter is constructive or destructive depending on the relative sign of the couplings constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the corresponding anomalous interaction lagrangians .",
    "we display numerical results for the @xmath18 reaction cross section in section 3 .",
    "we show the expected t - distributions at @xmath21=4 gev and 5 gev and emphasize the role of the double @xmath6-pole term and of the @xmath6-@xmath5 interference in these quantities . a few concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "the t - channel @xmath14- and @xmath6-exchange amplitudes contributing to the @xmath18 process in the n*(1535 ) region are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",

    "we have three contributions , associated with the @xmath14-exchange , the @xmath6-exchange and their interference respectively .",
    "the t - channel dominance is clearly an hypothesis which can but be confirmed by measurements of differential cross sections .",
    "we note that recent data on the @xmath32 reaction at @xmath21=2.4 gev @xcite show that this process is dominated by t - channel exchanges from threshold onwards .",
    "the exact nature of these exchanges is however not clear @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study a @xmath4-photoproduction process in which the excitation of the target to the n*@xmath13(1535 ) is expected to favour specifically unnatural parity exchanges , i.e. the @xmath14 and @xmath6 t - channel contributions .",
    "the 4-momenta of the photon , the proton , the @xmath4 , the @xmath6 and the final proton are denoted by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the photon , initial proton and final proton polarizations are indicated by the symbols @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the total cross section reads @xmath41    the photon-@xmath4-pseudoscalar meson vertices are described by the anomalous interaction lagrangian @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the chiral pseudoscalar mesons of interest , the pion or the @xmath6-meson . using this interaction lagrangian to calculate the @xmath45 and @xmath46 partial widths , we have @xmath47 identifying this expression with the experimental decay widths @xcite @xmath48 @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50    if we want to compute the interference between the @xmath14- and @xmath6-exchanges , we should know the relative sign of the coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is generally assumed that the @xmath51 transition is dominated by the @xmath52 mixing .",
    "the @xmath52 mixing angle is not easy to determine because it depends on the overlap of two narrow resonances far apart from each other .",
    "it is therefore model - dependent and sensitive to the assumptions used to calculate the @xmath53-meson self - energy far from the @xmath53 pole .",
    "the @xmath54 transition depends on the @xmath6-@xmath55 mixing , a phenomenon closely connected with the u(1 ) anomaly of qcd and still under analysis in different schemes @xcite .",
    "based on recent analyses of the available data , it is most often found that both @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same sign as @xmath56 , and hence a positive relative sign @xcite .",
    "the opposite conclusion has also been reached @xcite . in view of the uncertainties in the su(3 ) symmetry breaking mechanisms",
    "responsible for the mixing angles , we consider this relative sign as yet undetermined .",
    "we will now establish the dominance of the @xmath6-exchange process in the @xmath18 reaction in the kinematics of interest ( @xmath57 4 - 5 gev and @xmath58 1 gev@xmath22 ) . using the interaction lagrangian ( 2 ) , the squared amplitudes corresponding to the @xmath14-exchange , the @xmath6-exchange and their interference are @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 we work in the photon - proton center of mass reference frame where the total energy of the reaction is denoted by @xmath12 . in that reference frame ,",
    "the photon 3-momentum is -@xmath62 and the 3-momentum of the @xmath63 pair is -@xmath64 .",
    "we define the invariant mass @xmath65 of the final @xmath66 pair by @xmath67 and express the 4-momentum transfer @xmath68 as function of that variable , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angle between the initial photon and the produced @xmath4-meson .",
    "we define the notation @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    using the above variables , the differential cross section for the @xmath73 reaction with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "is given by @xmath76 the total cross section is obtained by integrating over @xmath74 from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and over @xmath75 from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . in all the results presented in the next section , we will restrict the interval of values of @xmath74 from @xmath81 gev@xmath22 to @xmath82 , the expected range of validity of our model . because @xmath77 extends to much lower values ( for @xmath831.54 gev , @xmath84 gev@xmath22 at @xmath855 gev for example )",
    ", we will refrain from displaying integrated cross sections .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ crosssectdiff ] ) is gauge - invariant because of the specific form of the interaction lagrangian ( [ anomalouslintpi ] ) .",
    "it is of interest to study the pole structure of the three contributions to the cross section ( @xmath5-exchange , @xmath6-exchange , interference ) as it determines the shape of the t - distributions .",
    "we have the following decompositions :    @xmath86    simple effects can be understood from these expressions irrespectively of the dynamical aspects of the scattering amplitudes and of the strength of the @xmath87 vertex .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( 14 ) that the double pion pole term ( proportional to @xmath88 ) dominates the pion - exchange contribution close to @xmath82 , becomes comparable to the single pion pole term ( proportional to @xmath89 ) around @xmath90 gev@xmath22 and smaller than the latter for larger values of @xmath91 . in the case of",
    "the @xmath6-exchange displayed in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , the single @xmath6 pole term is always dominant in the kinematic range under consideration .",
    "close to @xmath82 , the double @xmath6 pole term represents typically 25 - 30@xmath15 of the total @xmath6-exchange contribution .",
    "it is nevertheless instrumental in producing a rather sharp drop in the differential cross section . in the interference term ( 16 ) , the t - dependence is largely given by the single pion pole term at low @xmath91 .",
    "to derive eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we have assumed that the @xmath92 transition form factor is one .",
    "we have no information on that quantity but it influences significantly the outcome of our calculation",
    ". if the form factor is hard , its effect will be rather small .",
    "if it is soft , it could affect substantially the t - dependence of the @xmath73 reaction .",
    "the only argument we see in favour of a hard form factor is that there is no obvious intermediate state to build a form factor in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the @xmath6-meson couples dominantly to two photons and to three pions . to construct a form factor in the @xmath6-channel",
    ", one would need a significant decay of the @xmath4-meson into a photon and two vector particles or into a photon and three pions .",
    "the only available information is an upper limit of 5 10@xmath93 on the branching ratio of the @xmath4-meson to the @xmath94 channel @xcite . in the absence of more significant data ,",
    "it is not possible to gain a reasonable understanding of the @xmath92 form factor for space - like @xmath6-mesons",
    ". we will therefore set it to one , keeping this assumption in mind .",
    "finally , if our model takes into account the @xmath6-nucleon final state interaction to all orders , it does not treat @xmath4-nucleon rescattering in the outgoing channel .",
    "we do not expect this rescattering to be very important in the kinematics under consideration , i.e. with a large relative momentum between the @xmath4-meson emitted at small angles and the recoiling target products .",
    "in particular , we are not in the threshold regime where cryptoexotic @xmath95 baryons or @xmath96 resonances could enlarge final state interactions @xcite .",
    "we proceed to the calculation of the @xmath97 cross section as outlined in the previous section using the @xmath27 and @xmath28 scattering amplitudes obtained in the model of ref .",
    "these amplitudes are displayed in fig .",
    "1 true cm    0.4 true cm    0.7truecm 0.4true cm    0.4 true cm    we notice that the @xmath14n@xmath98n amplitude is about two to three times smaller than the @xmath6n scattering amplitude in the region of the n*(1535 ) resonance . combined with the very unfavourable ratio @xmath991/29 of the anomalous coupling constants",
    ", this effect suggests that the pion contribution to the @xmath97 cross section will be much smaller , typically by two orders of magnitude , than the @xmath6 contribution .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the amplitude displayed in fig .",
    "4 is very similar to the corresponding quantity obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that our calculation does not depend too much on the specific model used to derive the amplitudes .",
    "we emphasize also that the real part of the @xmath6n scattering amplitude is mostly visible in a narrow band of total center of mass energies , i.e. from threshold until 1.5 gev . beyond @xmath12=1.52 ,",
    "the cross section will be dominated by the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "consequently we will show results for two values of the invariant mass of the @xmath6n pair , @xmath100=1.49 gev ( very close to threshold ) and @xmath100=1.54 gev ( at the resonance peak ) .",
    "we consider first @xmath100=1.49 gev and display @xmath101 at @xmath85 4 gev and @xmath85 5 gev .",
    "this is shown in figs . 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "0.4 true cm    0.4 true cm    as discussed earlier , we do not know the relative sign of the @xmath102 and @xmath103 coupling constants .",
    "we have therefore considered both signs .",
    "if the coupling constants are of the same sign , the @xmath104 interference is destructive because of the opposite sign of the amplitudes ( solid curve ) .",
    "if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are of opposite sign , the @xmath104 interference is constructive ( dashed curve ) . in order to evaluate the importance of this interference , we show in addition the @xmath6-exchange contribution ( dot - dashed line ) and the @xmath5-exchange contribution ( dotted line ) .",
    "close to @xmath82 , the @xmath104 interference suppresses or enhances the differential cross section by about 30@xmath15 .",
    "as anticipated , the @xmath5-exchange contribution is completely negligible .",
    "we plot also the double pole contribution to the @xmath6-exchange ( dot - double - dashed line ) .",
    "it represents typically a quarter of the @xmath6-exchange term but contributes very significantly to the t - dependence of the differential cross section .",
    "if the @xmath104 interference is constructive , the pole structure of the @xmath6-exchange and of the interference leads to a rather sharp t - dependence close to @xmath82 .",
    "this effect increases with increasing laboratory photon energy as a lower @xmath20 can be reached .",
    "if the @xmath104 interference is destructive , the terms driving the increase of the differential cross section at low @xmath105 cancel significantly , leading to a rather flat behaviour .",
    "we show in figs . 7 and 8 the t - distributions for the total @xmath6n center of mass energy @xmath100 = 1.54 gev , taken to be close to the n*(1535 ) mass",
    "the comparison to the results obtained at @xmath100 = 1.49 gev for the same value of the incident photon laboratory energy shows that the cross section increases .",
    "this is a consequence of the opening of the @xmath6n phase space and of the presence of the n*(1535 ) resonance ( implying a large imaginary part in the amplitude ) .",
    "otherwise the features of the differential cross section @xmath101 are very similar for both values of @xmath100 .",
    "we emphazise however that the differential cross section @xmath101 at @xmath100 = 1.49 gev and at @xmath100 = 1.54 gev tests different parts of the @xmath6n scattering amplitudes , the real and imaginary parts at threshold on the one hand and the imaginary part at the resonance peak on the other hand .",
    "we remark also that the @xmath106 scattering amplitude is very much constrained by data on the @xmath107 cross section close to threshold @xcite . if our model is correct , accurate data on the @xmath101 reaction at low @xmath105 could therefore be interpreted in terms of the @xmath108 scattering amplitude .",
    "we have underlined two uncertainties in such an analysis , the relative sign of the @xmath102 and @xmath103 coupling constants and a possible effect due to a @xmath92 transition form factor for space - like @xmath6 s .",
    "we have studied the @xmath97 reaction with the idea of using future accurate data on this process to gain understanding of the threshold behaviour of the @xmath6-nucleon scattering amplitude .",
    "we chose kinematic conditions where a t - channel meson - exchange description is expected to be valid ( i.e. low momentum transfers ) .",
    "we showed that the process in which the initial photon dissociates into a @xmath4-meson and a virtual @xmath6-meson scattering from the proton target to produce an @xmath6 proton final state is dominant for ( @xmath109p ) pairs with invariant masses close to the n*(1535 ) mass .",
    "it can however interfere with the analogous process where a @xmath5-meson is exchanged .",
    "the @xmath5-exchange term is negligible .",
    "the sign of the @xmath104 interference is at present not known .",
    "we show how it changes both the t - dependence and the absolute value of the differential cross section .    in view of the fact that the @xmath106 scattering amplitude in the n*(1535 ) resonance region is rather well - known",
    ", accurate data on the @xmath97 reaction at @xmath85 4 - 5 gev and low t would put additional constraints on the still poorly controlled @xmath6-proton scattering amplitude close to threshold .",
    "the expected cross sections are small but do not appear out of reach of present experimental facilities .",
