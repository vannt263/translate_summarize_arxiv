    "the evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe , initially based on the observations of distant supernovae @xcite and later strengthened by precise measurements of cosmic microwave background fluctuations @xcite , has established a new cosmological paradigm based on the presence of a ` dark energy ' component . in the new scenario ,",
    "the universe has recently made a ( smooth ) transition from a matter - dominated , decelerating stage to a dark - energy dominated , accelerating stage .    in the simplest models ,",
    "consistent with the observations so far , the dark energy behaves like einstein s cosmological constant , providing an always present , constant , positive energy density ( and a negative pressure of the same magnitude ) .",
    "as long as the matter density was substantially larger than the dark energy density , it dominated the evolution of the universe , decelerating the expansion and driving the formation of structures by gravitational instability .",
    "when the average matter density fell below that of the dark energy , the latter started accelerating the expansion , and the formation of structure slowed down , as the gravitational forces between matter elements decreased due to their increasing separation . in this stage",
    ", structures much denser than the dark energy are not affected by the latter and remain bound , while they separate from each other at an accelerating rate , which does not allow them to join in larger structures .",
    "thus , at the present cosmological time , when the acceleration of the expansion has recently started , the largest bound structures are just forming . in the future evolution of the universe , their individual , internal properties ( such as physical size and density ) will not change substantially , but they will grow increasingly isolated , forming ` island universes ' ( e.  g. , @xcite ) .    in the present universe ,",
    "these structures have not yet fully formed , virialized , and clearly separated from each other , making it difficult to identify them unambiguously .",
    "superclusters , the largest structures identifiable in the present universe , have generally been defined by more or less arbitrary criteria ( e.  g. , @xcite ) . here , we address the question of how to decide whether such a structure will remain gravitationally bound in the future evolution of the universe , forming an island universe , and propose to use this criterion as a physical definition of superclusters .",
    "we study the well - known spherical collapse model in the presence of a cosmological constant , with the aim of obtaining a useful method to study structure behavior in our universe .",
    "the spherical collapse model considers a spherically symmetric mass distribution , where spherical shells expand or collapse into the centre of the structure in a purely radial motion and without crossing each other . specifically , we study the density that needs to be enclosed by a spherical shell at a given cosmological epoch in order to stay gravitationally attached to the overdense region within in a distant future , dominated by a cosmological constant .",
    "previously , @xcite gave an approximate criterion for this density , assuming that the shell in question initially expands with the hubble flow ( without retardation from the enclosed over - density ) and present density evolution curves considering different cosmologies .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , solved the spherical collapse equations numerically , both with a cosmological constant and with a more general form of dark energy ( with a constant ` equation - of - state parameter ' @xmath3 ) , obtaining a self - consistent , theoretical criterion for the mean density enclosed in the last gravitationally bound or ` critical ' shell .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite studied the future evolution of structures numerically , contrasting the extension of bound structures in a distant future ( at scale parameter @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) with the criterion of @xcite applied at the present time ( @xmath6 ) . while @xcite focused on the evolution of specific structures in our local universe ( the local group , the virgo cluster , and other nearby structures ) , @xcite followed the internal density and velocity structures of generic , bound objects as they evolve , a subject taken up again by the same authors more recently @xcite .",
    "we stress that , among the previous work cited above , only @xcite used the spherical collapse model self - consistently in order to obtain the density criterion for the last bound shell , whereas all the other papers rely on the incorrect assumption that the shell expands with the hubble flow at the initial epoch ( taken to be the present time , both by @xcite and @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite did not perform numerical simulations of the future evolution of structure in order to test the accuracy of their result in a non - ideal situation and in order to study the details of the evolution of bound objects , as the other authors did . in this work",
    ", we attempt to bring together and extend the best parts of the previous work , by a self - consistent application of the spherical collapse model ( supplemented by a new , analytic equation for the mean density of a marginally bound sphere ) and a comparison of its predictions to @xmath0-body simulations of the future universe .    in section [ spherical collapse model ] ,",
    "we review the spherical collapse model , deriving an analytical solution for the spherical collapse equations . our solution , which agrees with the numerical result of @xcite , relates the critical shell s overdensity with the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 $ ] ( where @xmath8 is the cosmological constant and @xmath9 is the hubble parameter ) , so we are able to evaluate the criterion at any time @xmath10 of the evolution of the universe .",
    "we also obtain numerical solutions for the velocities of non - critical shells in the present universe ( @xmath11 ) .    in sections [ numerical simulations ] through [ comparison between theory and simulated data ] , we compare the theoretical results with simulated data , studying the quality of the criterion and its applicability to real - world observations . as in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", simulations were run until the very late future ( @xmath5 ) , in order to reproduce the final configuration of bound structures .",
    "we find that the rigorous density criterion proposed by us ( in agreement with @xcite ) gives a good upper bound to the size of the bound structure , as it encloses @xmath1 per cent of the bound particles . on the other hand",
    ", it also encloses a substantial number of unbound particles , and therefore does not perform as well as the criterion of @xcite ( used by @xcite and @xcite ) for the purpose of estimating the bound mass .",
    "we also show that the spherical collapse model is quite accurate in predicting ( as a function of the enclosed mean density ) the radial velocity of the stream of particles falling into a bound structure for the first time , down to the very centre of the structure .",
    "a straightforward approach to the evolution of structure is obtained by considering a spherical distribution where all layers expand or contract with only radial motions and without crossing each other .",
    "the later ensures that the enclosed mass in every shell stays constant throughout its whole evolution , being the only parameter other than initial conditions to determine its behavior .",
    "the model is more accurate during the expansion phase , but becomes unrealistic after contraction begins , because the instability in angular momentum during this phase causes non - radial motions and finally virialization . in our analysis",
    ", we are going to leave aside this warning and check the accuracy of the model in the contraction phase using comparison with simulations .",
    "our analysis will be based on newtonian mechanics , which , according to @xcite , is a limiting approximation to general relativity , valid no matter what is happening in distant parts of the universe .",
    "the newtonian approximation is accurate in a region small compared to the hubble length @xmath12 and large compared to the schwarzschild radii of any collapsed objects . for more details , see @xcite .    under the assumption that the total energy will be conserved during the shell s expansion and later contraction",
    ", the evolution of a spherical shell enclosing a spherically symmetric mass distribution is given by the energy equation @xcite :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the shell s radius , @xmath15 is the total mass enclosed by it , @xmath8 is the cosmological constant and @xmath16 is the total energy per unit mass of the shell .",
    "this equation can be simplified by introducing the following dimensionless variables : @xmath17 @xmath18 therefore , the equation may be written @xmath19 where @xmath20    fixing @xmath15 and considering that there is no shell crossing , this equation describes the time evolution of a single shell .",
    "@xmath21 is the dimensionless energy that describes every shell of the distribution , merging with the background s mean density when @xmath22 , shell that will expand with the hubble flow .",
    "we are looking for a critical shell that will stay at the limit between expanding for ever or re - collapsing into the structure . to find the critical energy for such a shell , we define a potential energy to be maximized as @xmath23 the maximum of this potential occurs at @xmath24 , so @xmath25 is the maximum possible energy for a shell to remain attached to the structure .",
    "the maximum radius for a critical shell is @xmath26 so we can reinterpret the normalized radius @xmath27 as @xmath28      assuming a flat universe with cosmological constant , the age of the universe ( time since the big bang , written in our dimensionless variables ) may be related to the vacuum energy density parameter @xcite , @xmath29 showing that @xmath30 increases monotonically in time , and can therefore be used as a surrogate time variable , in terms of which we will describe the evolution of bound or critical ( marginally bound ) spherical shells .",

    "it is convenient to express the critical condition as the minimum enclosed mean density needed by a shell to stay bound to the central gravitational attractor .",

    "this represents the present density contrast inside the last shell that will eventually stop its growth at the end of times .",

    "this result was expected , since the criterion of @xcite was obtained under the assumption that the test particles , placed on the critical shell today , move with the hubble flow . as this is not really true ,",
    "they free that parameter ( velocity of particles on the critical shell today ) and do an empirical test to observe the real behavior of particles evolved till @xmath64 .",
    "they obtain a corrected result which is closer to their initial result than to ours , always setting a higher constraint to the critical shell density .",
    "a probable reason for this difference is that our result is a completely theoretical approach based on the spherical collapse model ( only radial motions ) , but in real life objects usually obtain angular momentum caused by tidal forces , which will tend to detach objects from the structure , strengthening the binding condition .",
    "this discussion will be resumed later , in relation to the results of our simulations .      in order to work with shell velocities ,",
    "it is convenient to refer the radial velocities to the hubble flow , so we introduce the parameter @xmath65 , defined as in @xcite , @xmath66 for a critical shell , we can use equation ( [ eq : e_b ] ) to write this in terms of @xmath30 as @xmath67.\\ ] ] evaluating at @xmath44 , we obtain that the present velocity parameter for a critical shell is @xmath68 , showing that the shell has been slowed down substantially with respect to the hubble flow .",

    "it is also important to add that objects 6 and 7 had very complex cores , being separated into two main concentrations . of these , we selected the most massive as the centre of the spherical analysis .",
    "we kept our selection criterion for the centre , under the assumption that it should be easier to detect the centre of the most massive concentration when dealing with real observations .",
    "an important prediction of the spherical collapse model is the radial velocity of shells falling toward the gravitational attractor .",

    "[ fig : vr_tipo ] , we plot the radial velocity against radius , together with the theoretical approximation using the spherical collapse model with and without cosmological constant ( see @xcite , for details about the approximation using the spherical collapse model without a cosmological constant ) .",
    "for this analysis , we chose object no.9 because it presented a clear stream of infalling particles flowing at high speed to the object s core , cleanly separated from the virialized particles and from particles currently outflowing after a first pass through the centre , forming an empty space reaching as close as @xmath117 from the core .",
    "other objects presented similar overall characteristics , but they did not show such a clear separation between infalling particles and virialized ones , probably as a result of earlier virialization or the presence of substructure .",
    "we observe that the spherical model with cosmological constant is accurate to determine the mean radial velocity of the infalling part of the cluster particles , correcting the underestimate of radial velocities at large radius seen in the spherical model without cosmological constant .",
    "an important observation is that the theoretical velocity profile follows the infalling particles deep into the core of the structure , where virialization effects are very important .",
    "this result , which was confirmed on every object we studied , tells us that the spherical collapse model produces robust predictions of the negative velocity envelope profile even in highly virialized cores .",
    "the decrease on the predicted velocity very near to the centre is probably due to the poor resolution of the simulation and to extreme virialization effects .      in the previous analyses ,",
    "we observe that there is a considerable number of particles that escape from the structure , contradicting the theoretical prediction .",
    "there are two main candidates to be responsible for this : one is the appearance of tangential velocities during the contraction , which is also responsible for virialization , the other is the influence of external structures which can act as gravitational attractor on external shells .",
    "a simple test is to plot tangential velocities as a function of radius .",
    "we would expect that if there is a clear relation between angular momentum and failure of the criterion , we would find that particles that contradict the criterion would have greater tangential velocities than particles that verify the criterion .",
    "this was done for object no . 9 and results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vt_r ] .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vt_r ] , and as we observed in all other objects , there is no clear relation between tangential velocity and probability of escaping .",
    "this result is solid enough to say that angular momentum is not the main reason for the failure of the criterion , so the hypothesis of external attractors seems more acceptable .",
    "just as a follow - up observation , we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:3d_distr ] that the particles incorrectly identified as bound by our criterion ( blue ) are commonly related to denser regions outside and close to the critical shell , while the particles incorrectly identified as unbound ( red ) are close to mass concentrations inside the critical shell that finally fall to the centre .",
    "we conclude that the failure of the method is mainly caused by external overdensities or perturbations from the spherical distribution of the studied object .",
    "we have presented a complete discussion of the model of spherical , gravitational collapse in a flat universe with a cosmological constant , applied to estimate the size and mass of bound structures in the universe . within this model",
    ", we derive an exact , analytical equation for the minimum enclosed mass density required for a shell to remain bound until a very distant future . for the present cosmological parameters ( @xmath118 , @xmath82 ) , this minimum density is 2.36 times the critical density of the universe , as found numerically by @xcite .",
    "this suggests a both physical and practical criterion for the limits of a bound structure , such as the previously fairly ill - defined superclusters of galaxies , as the shell enclosing precisely this density .",
    "the application of the model to simulated data gave encouraging results , demonstrating first its great ability to find the limits of structure in the late future , and , second , giving reasonably good results in determining the limits of bound structures at the present epoch .",
    "on average , 72 per cent of the mass enclosed by the estimated radius is really bound to the structure , while the mass that , although bound to the structure , is not enclosed by the radius is only a 0.3 per cent . for the less rigorous criterion of @xcite and other authors ,",
    "these numbers are 90 and 13 per cent , giving a substantially better estimate for the object s final mass .",
    "thus , the sphere defined by our criterion is an outer envelope enclosing all the particles bound to the structure ( and quite a few more ) , while that of @xcite encloses as much mass as will remain bound to the distant future ( leaving about as many bound particles outside as unbound ones inside ) .",
    "the spherical collapse model also defines a radial velocity profile that we will use in our next paper ( dnner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) to find the shape of these structures in redshift space , in order to make them identifiable in redshift surveys .",
    "this profile was found in the simulations to fit the observed velocity profile of infalling particles well down to deep inside the virialized radius .",
    "thus , even though the spherical collapse model is intrinsically unstable for contracting shells , it still gives a reliable performance in a broad set of radii .",
    "moreover , we observed that the greatest perturbations from the theoretical model were produced by gravitational perturbations by external structures or by substructures falling into the external shells of the structure .    ",

    "<S> according to the latest evidence , the universe is entering an era of exponential expansion , where gravitationally bound structures will get disconnected from each other , forming isolated ` island universes ' . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> we present a theoretical criterion to determine the boundaries of gravitationally bound structures and a physically motivated definition of superclusters as the largest bound structures in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we use the spherical collapse model self - consistently to obtain an analytical condition for the mean density enclosed by the last bound shell of the structure ( 2.36 times the critical density in the present universe , assumed to be flat , with 30 per cent matter and 70 per cent cosmological constant , in agreement with the previous , numerical result of chiueh and he ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-body simulations extended to the future show that this criterion , applied at the present cosmological epoch , defines a sphere that encloses @xmath1 per cent of the particles that will remain bound to the structure at least until the scale parameter of the universe is 100 times its present value . on the other hand , @xmath2 per cent of the enclosed particles are in fact not bound , so the enclosed mass overestimates the bound mass , in contrast with the previous , less rigorous criterion of , e.  g. , busha and collaborators , which gave a more precise mass estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we also verify that the spherical collapse model estimate for the radial infall velocity of a shell enclosing a given mean density gives an accurate prediction for the velocity profile of infalling particles , down to very near the centre of the virialized core .    </S>",
