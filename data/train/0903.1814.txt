    "the idea that the fermi surface ( fs ) , through instabilities in the electronic structure ( such as nesting features or van hove saddle points ) , can drive low - dimensional systems into new ground states such as spin - density or charge - density waves ( cdw ) , is well - known ( for example , the transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite and cr @xcite ) .",
    "more recent theoretical studies of the role of the fs in cdw formation @xcite have contributed greatly to our understanding of the phenomenon , and have clarified a number of misconceptions . specifically , those authors emphasize that simply inspecting the fs for possible nesting features without actually calculating the real part of the electronic susceptibility does not help in predicting cdw instabilities @xcite .",

    "the critical phonon softening , inferred from the thermal diffuse scattering above 148k ( and which also disappears at the ferromagnetic transition ) occurs at two specific wavevectors , namely @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "spin - polarized calculations for smnic@xmath1 at two different magnetic moments ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) demonstrate the gradual destruction of the nesting properties of the fs with increasing moment .",
    "the strong peak in @xmath18 that is present at zero moment becomes washed out as the spin - polarized bands separate , in agreement with the suggestion of shimomura _ et al .",
