    "the basic idea behind the analysis of a temporal or spatial signal by a fourier transform is _",
    "similarity_. for instance , the inner product @xmath5 expresses how similar are the function @xmath6 and the @xmath7 element of the basis @xmath8 ( the kernel of the transform ) .",
    "the kernel of fourier transform is a plane wave and here lies its simplicity , but also its limitation . rigorously speaking ,",
    "a plane wave exists everywhere in the universe and at all ( past and future ) times .",
    "hence there are no plane waves in nature .",
    "all physical signals are temporary and spatially limited . as a consequence of the infinitely extended kernel , the fourier transform is unable to satisfactorily determine _ when _ a burst has occured , or _ where _ edges of images are located , for example ( the gibbs phenomenon , see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the first attempt to overcome limitations of fourier analysis was that of gabor @xcite , who introduced a windowed fourier transform @xcite .",
    "he used a modulation function @xmath9 in order to localize the signal in a time interval @xmath10 $ ] ( @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "translations in time would cover the whole signal . with this , he achieved time - frequency localization .",
    "but a problem still remains with the use of a fixed scale window : signal details much smaller than the window width @xmath12 are detected , but not localized .",
    "they appear in the frequency behaviour of the windowed fourier transform in a similar way it would appear in the usual fourier transform .",
    "signal features much larger than @xmath12 , on the other hand , appear in the time behaviour of the windowed fourier transform ( i.e. , they are not detected ) .    to avoid this problem ,",
    "it is sufficient a scale free transform .",
    "wavelet analysis was developed to accomplish this goal .",
    "the windowed fourier transform uses a fixed size window and fills it with oscillations of different frequencies ( consequently , varies the number of oscillations within the window ) .",
    "the wavelet transform uses a function with fixed number of oscillations and vary the width of the window .",
    "dilations and translations generate a complete analysis of the signal .",
    "this procedure automatically uses small windows to identify high - frequency components of a signal , and large windows for low - frequency components .",
    "wavelet analysis provides a time - scale ( instead of a time - frequency ) localization .",
    "wavelet analysis was developed more than a century and a half after the pioneering work of fourier @xcite . since the 1980 s it has grown so fast that it has already consolidated as a field of research of its own .",
    "another emerging science is nonextensive statistical mechanics , that also began in the 1980 s , with the formulation of the concept of a nonextensive entropy @xcite , that generalizes the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , as a basis of a generalization of standard statistical mechanics itself .",
    "here , it took also more than a century since the first formulation of the concept of entropy .",
    "nonextensive statistical mechanics seems to give an underlying formal basis for a variety of complex phenomena , such as anomalous diffusion , self - gravitating systems @xcite , turbulence cosmic rays @xcite , among others ( for un updated bibliography , see @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of the nonextensive @xmath0-entropy @xcite is @xmath13 the entropic index @xmath0 characterizes the generalization and the boltzmann - gibbs - shanon entropy , @xmath14 , is recovered at @xmath4 .",

    "the striking features of ( [ pi ] ) are its power - law for @xmath30 , and the cut - off for @xmath23 , which generates quite different behaviours when compared with the boltzmann - gibbs exponential distribution .",
    "the meaning of the word _ nonextensive _ can be easily understood if we consider a system composed of two independent subsystems ( in the sense of probability theory , @xmath31 ) . according to ( [ sq ] )",
    ", the @xmath0-entropy of the composite system is given by @xmath32 clearly @xmath33 yields nonadditivity , or nonextensivity .",
    "a system with @xmath30 is said to be subadditive , and if @xmath23 , it is superadditive .",
    "the functional forms of ( [ sq ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) inspired the definition of generalizations of the logarithm and exponential functions @xcite : @xmath34 @xmath35^\\frac{1}{1-q } , & \\mbox{if } [ 1+(1-q)x ] > 0 \\\\ \\noalign{\\smallskip } 0\\ ; ,    & \\mbox{otherwise}. \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows immediately that @xmath36 .",
    "the original logarithm and exponential functions are recovered as the particular cases @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "many formal developments have been made concerning such functions . among them",
    "we point out the generalization @xcite of the celebrated shannon s theorem .",
    "obviously there are infinitely many ways of generalizing a given function .",
    "one commonly form of generalizing the exponential is @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 and also @xmath42 .",
    "this particular expression have applications in quantum groups @xcite . in this paper",
    "we wo nt explore this possibility , but rather that one given by equation ( [ expq ] ) above , that naturally emerges from nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "relations between wavelet analysis and nonextensive statistical mechanics have already been reported , including applications in biophysics , as the analysis of eeg signals .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the use of such @xmath0-deformed functions into wavelet analysis by generalizing some widely used wavelet functions .",
    "particularly , we generalize the mexican hat ( section  [ sec : q - mexicanhat ] ) and the modulated gaussian ( section  [ sec : q - gaussian ] ) .",
    "moreover , we introduce in section  [ sec : q - trigonometric ] a pair of even and odd wavelets based on the generalization of trigonometric functions .",
    "finally ( section  [ sec : example ] ) we exemplify , with the wavelet transform modulus - maxima method for mono- and multi - fractal self - affine signals , the possible use of the introduced functions , and , lastly , we present our final remarks ( section  [ sec : final ] ) .",
    "before we discuss the properties of the wavelets based on definitions ( [ lnq ] ) and ( [ expq ] ) , let us indicate some basic facts about continuous @xmath43-wavelet transform of a function @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which is defined by @xmath46 in order that a given function @xmath47 can be considered as a mother wavelet , it must satisfy the so - called admissibility condition , that can be expressed in terms of its fourier transform @xmath48 by @xmath49 it essentially means that @xmath50 has zero mean , i.e. , @xmath51 and ensures that the the original function @xmath6 can be recovered from its wavelet transform as @xmath52 this expression shows that , if a mother wavelet @xmath43 satisfies ( [ eq11a ] ) , it generates , by its translations and dilations , a basis in the hilbert space , so that any function @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of its @xmath54wavelet components .",
    "it is well known that orthonormal wavelet bases can only be defined within the discrete formulation , i.e. , when @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "so , orthonormal bases can not be defined with the help of the functions we discuss below .",
    "a simple and quite common example of continuous wavelet is the mexican hat ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , that is generated from the gaussian distribution : @xmath59 the normalization constant is given by @xmath60 .",
    "generalization of gaussian distribution within nonextensive scenario we are focusing here has already been made @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-gaussian ( @xmath61 ) unifies a great variety of different distributions into a single family , parameterized by @xmath0 ( see @xcite for details ) : gaussian distribution is recovered , of course , for @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath63 , we have the cauchy - lorentz distribution . besides , @xmath64 yields a completely flat distribution , and @xmath65 yields dirac s @xmath66 .",
    "this unifying character of the @xmath0-gaussian , as well as its empirically observed occurence in a variety of complex phenomena ( as cited in the introdutcion ) stimulate us to explore its potential use in wavelet analysis .",
    "one of the more simple applications that immediately come to our minds is to use it in order to generalize the mexican hat , a function that is proportional to the second derivative of a gaussian .",
    "we could simply replace an ordinary gaussian by a @xmath0-gaussian , which is a legitimate choice . instead of doing that",
