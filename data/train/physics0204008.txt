    "photonic crystal fibers ( pcf ) constitute a new class of optical fibers which has revealed many surprising phenomena and also has a big potential from an application point of view ( for recent special issues on photonic crystal fibers , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we consider the type of pcf first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite which consists of pure silica with a cladding with air - holes of diameter @xmath2 arranged in a triangular lattice with pitch @xmath3 , see fig .  1 .",
    "for a review of the basic operation we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective area is a quantity of great importance .",
    "it was originally introduced as a measure of non - linearities ; a low effective area gives a high density of power needed for non - linear effects to be significant @xcite .",
    "however , the effective area can of course also be related to the spot - size @xmath4 through @xmath5 , and thus it is also important in the context of confinement loss @xcite , micro - bending loss @xcite , macro - bending loss @xcite , splicing loss @xcite , and numerical aperture @xcite .",
    "strictly endlessly single - mode operation of pcfs @xcite is possible for @xmath6 @xcite , but even for larger air holes single - mode operation is possible for wavelengths above a certain cut - off @xmath7 .",
    "we demonstrate that the effective area of the second - order mode is a useful concept in determining this cut - off for a given hole size @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath8 we recover the endlessly single - mode regime with @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the concept of the effective area and in sec .",
    "iii we report numerical results for pcfs of the type shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusions are given .",
    "we consider pcfs realized in dielectric materials with no free charges or currents . from maxwell",
    "s equations it then follows that the @xmath10-field is governed by the general wave equation ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath11= ( \\omega / c)^2{\\boldsymbol h}_\\omega({\\boldsymbol r})\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the dielectric function and @xmath13 is the frequency of the harmonic mode , @xmath14 .",
    "the pcf has translation symmetry along the fiber axis ( @xmath15-axis ) and for @xmath16 the solution is of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transverse part of the @xmath19th eigen - mode and @xmath20 is the corresponding propagation constant at frequency @xmath13 . often one will specify the free - space wavelength @xmath21 rather than the frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the effective area associated with the @xmath19th eigen - mode is given by  @xcite    @xmath23 ^ 2\\big/\\int d{\\boldsymbol r}_\\perp i_{n}^2({\\boldsymbol r}_\\perp),\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the intensity distribution .",
    "it is easy to show that for a gaussian mode @xmath25 of width @xmath4 the effective area is @xmath5 . applying eq .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) to close - to - gaussian modes in some way corresponds to a gaussian fit averaged over all angular directions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we illustrate this by an example . for @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "we compare the intensity @xmath28 of the fundamental mode ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) to the intensity @xmath31 of the corresponding gaussian with the width calculated from @xmath0 .",
    "as seen the over - all intensity distribution is reasonably described by the gaussian with a width calculated from the effective area .",
    "the low - intensity deviations from a gaussian intensity distribution are coursed by the six - fold symmetry of the air hole lattice ; the field extends slightly into the six silica bridges formed by the six holes nearest to the core .",
    "similar modal properties have been found experimentally , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "below we mention a few examples of some of the different phenomena and quantities which can be at least partly quantified from knowledge of the effective area ; the non - linearity coefficient , the numerical aperture , the macro - bending loss coefficient , and splicing loss . in sec .",
    "iii we also discuss how a second - order mode cut - off can be identified using the concept of the effective area .      the non - linearity coefficient @xmath32 is given by @xcite    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the nonlinear - index coefficient in the nonlinear part of the refractive index , @xmath35 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath0 is thus an important starting point in the understanding of non - linear phenomena in pcfs . due to the high index contrast between",
    "silica and air the pcf technology offers the possibility of a much tighter mode confinement ( over a wide wavelength range ) and thereby a lower effective area compared to standard - fiber technology .",
    "furthermore , the microstructured cladding of the pcfs also allows for zero - dispersion engineering . for a recent demonstration of a highly nonlinear pcf with a zero - dispersion at @xmath36 see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also the numerical aperture ( na ) relates to the effective area . for a gaussian field of width @xmath4",
    "one has the standard approximate expression @xmath37 for the half - divergence angle @xmath38 of the light radiated from the end - facet of the fiber @xcite .",
    "the corresponding numerical aperture can then be expressed as    @xmath39    in ref .",
    "@xcite this was used in a study of the numerical aperture of pcfs .      for estimation of the macro - bending loss coefficient @xmath40 the sakai ",
    "kimura formula @xcite can be applied to pcfs .",
    "this involves an evaluation of the ratio @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the amplitude coefficient of the field in the cladding and @xmath43 the power carried by the fundamental mode .",
    "the gaussian approximation gives @xmath44 @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite this was used to calculate the macro - bending loss in pcfs based on fully - vectorial eigenmodes of maxwell s equations .",
    "also splicing loss can be quantified in terms of the concepts of effective areas .",
    "the splicing of two aligned fibers with effective areas @xmath45 and @xmath46 will have a power transmission coefficient @xmath47 given approximately by    @xmath48    due to the mismatch of effective areas .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) numerically and from the eigenmodes we calculate the corresponding effective area from eq .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) .",
    "the fully - vectorial eigenmodes of maxwell s equations are computed with periodic boundary conditions in a planewave basis @xcite .",
    "this approach provides the eigenmodes on a discrete lattice and the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) are then obtained by sums over lattice sites inside the super - cell . for the dielectric function",
    "we have used @xmath49 for the air holes and @xmath50 for the silica . ignoring the frequency dependence of the latter the wave equation , eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) becomes scale - invariant @xcite and all the results to be presented can thus be scaled to the desired value of @xmath3 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the effective area of the fundamental mode as a function of wavelength for different hole sizes .",
    "as expected the mode becomes more confined ",
    "lower effective area  for increasing air hole size .",
    "in general we find that the effective area of the fundamental mode is of the order of @xmath51 with a prefactor which depends slightly on the air hole size .",
    "in fact , scaling the results by a factor @xmath52 we find numerical evidence that    @xmath53    and as demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the prefactor is of order @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a general `` map '' of the effective area which can be used in calculating the different quantities discussed in sec .",
    "ii as well as for designing single - mode pcfs with specified modal properties .",
    "if for example the value of @xmath52 is given ( which is often the case during stack - and - pull production of pcfs ) a given effective area can be obtained by scaling the fiber structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the pitch @xmath3 .",
    "the corning smf28 standard fiber has an effective area @xmath55 at @xmath56 and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests that a comparable effective area can be realized by the pcf technology using _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath57 and @xmath58 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show a calculation of the effective area of the second - order mode ( @xmath59 ) for a pcf with @xmath60 air holes . for short wavelengths",
    "the effective area is of the order @xmath51 with the mode confined to the core of the pcf . at long wavelengths the effective area diverges corresponding to a delocalized cladding mode . even though the transition to a cladding mode is not abrupt the high slope of the effective area allows for a rather accurate introduction of a cut - off wavelength @xmath7 .",
    "this cut - off wavelength is indicated by the crossing of the dashed line with the horizontal axis .",
    "conditions for single - mode operation of pcfs turn out to be very different from standard fiber technology and for not too big air holes , @xmath61 , they can even be endlessly single - mode @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the effective cladding index has a wavelength dependence which prevents the core from guidance of higher - order modes while still guiding a fundamental mode . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath62 was suggested from standard - fiber considerations .",
    "for @xmath63 a second - order mode is guided for wavelengths shorter than a certain cut - off and above this cut - off the pcf is single - mode .",
    "this cut - off of the second - order mode can be found from studies of the corresponding effective area ; below the cut - off the effective area @xmath64 is finite and comparable to @xmath51 and above the cut - off the effective area diverges ( in a super - cell calculation it approaches the area of the super - cell ) .    comparing fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath60 it is seen how we for wavelengths shorter than @xmath65 have a multi - mode pcf whereas the pcf is in the single - mode regime for @xmath66 .",
    "carrying out the same analysis for different hole - sizes allows for constructing a `` phase '' diagram , see fig .",
    "the data points indicate calculated cut - off wavelengths and the solid line is a fit to the function    @xmath67    with the fitting coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the solid line defines a `` phase '' boundary ; above the line the pcf is single - mode and below it is multi - mode .",
    "furthermore there is an endlessly single - mode regime for @xmath70 @xcite . in principle",
    "the effective area approach allows for an independent determination of @xmath71 but it should be emphasized that the numerical efforts needed to resolve the cut - off increase dramatically when @xmath2 approaches @xmath71 .",
    "we have considered the effective area @xmath0 of photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) with a triangular air - hole lattice in the cladding . based on extensive numerical studies of pcfs with varying air hole size",
    "we have constructed a map of the effective area which can be scaled to a desired value of the pitch .",
    "we have also utilized the concept of effective area to calculate the `` phase '' boundary between the regimes with single - mode and multi - mode operation . in this work",
    "we have studied pcfs with a triangular air - hole lattice cladding , but we emphasize that the approach applies to microstructured fibers in general .",
    "the author has benefitted from useful discussions with j.  r. jensen , p.  m.  w. skovgaard , m.  d. nielsen , j. broeng , and k.  p. hansen ."
