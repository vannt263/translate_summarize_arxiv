    "the fact that the spatially averaged inhomogeneous universe does not evolve as the standard model of cosmology , furnished by a homogeneous  isotropic solution of einstein s laws of gravity , has recently become a major topic aiming at a possible solution to the dark energy problem @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while the averaging problem in relativistic cosmology has a long history , initiated by george ellis @xcite ( references may be found in @xcite and @xcite ) , the backreaction terms , i.e. those averaged contributions that lead to deviations from a friedmannian cosmology , have been considered quantitatively unimportant .",
    "recent work that conjectures a large backreaction effect ( e.g. @xcite ) has been accompanied both by counter conjectures ( e.g. @xcite ) and special solutions of the averaged einstein equations @xcite that support the claim that backreaction could be made responsible for the dark energy gap ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references and discussion in @xcite ) .    in parallel to this discussion ,",
    "other models have been extensively investigated , most notably quintessence models that invoke the presence of a scalar field source , this scalar field being a standard one or a phantom field ( with a negative kinetic energy ) @xcite and references in the reviews @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those models imply the possibility of a scenario featuring a time  dependent cosmological term .",
    "particular properties of the scalar field potential are discussed on phenomenological grounds , which can lead to an acceleration of the regional universe and so to an explanation of dark energy . a further problem in conjunction with modeling a repulsive component in universe models",
    "is known as the _ coincidence problem _",
    ", i.e. a recent domination of this component is favoured , possibly occuring around the epoch of structure formation .",
    "its solution also motivates the construction of models with a time ",
    "dependent cosmological term that needs no ` fine  tuning ' .",
    "in this paper we also consider scalar field cosmologies , but we shift the perspective from the usual interpretation of a scalar field _ source _ in einstein s equations to a mean field description of averaged inhomogeneities . we see a number of advantages entailed by such a description that motivated the present investigation .",
    "first , a ( homogeneous ) scalar field as a model of spatially averaged ( i.e. effectively homogeneous ) geometrical degrees of freedom that are physically present does not need to be justified as an additional source arising from fundamental field theories ; it has a well  defined physical status and , as such , does not suffer from a phenomenological parameterization , since it is constrained by einstein s field equations .",
    "second , inhomogeneities encoded in backreaction terms _ give rise to _ the scalar field cosmology , fixing its potential , its equation of state , etc . ; they not only influence the evolution of the scalar field , but they determine it .",
    "third , the proposed correspondence allows a realistic reinterpretation of quintessence models and other phenomenological approaches involving scalar fields .",
    "these approaches must not be considered as independent alternatives , they here describe the same physics that also underlies the backreaction approach , and so can be confronted with physical constraints ; in other words , if backreaction can indeed be made responsible for the late  time acceleration of the universe , then the effort spent on quintessence models and other approaches @xcite can be fruitfully exploited in terms of the proposed rephrasing .",
    "fourth , since the underlying effective equations are general and do not invoke perturbative assumptions , the scalar field cosmology provides access to the whole solution space , notably to the non  perturbative regime .",
    "finally , subcases of exact solutions include a cosmological constant , which therefore can or can not be included in einstein s equations ; the cosmological constant is a particular solution of the averaged inhomogeneous model without necessarily being present in einstein s equations .    since the scalar field introduced in this way stems from averaged geometrical degrees of freedom , i.e. kinematical backreaction terms encoded in the extrinsic curvature of spatial hypersurfaces , as well as their scalar curvature , we call it the _ morphon field _",
    ": it effectively models the inhomogeneities _ shaping _ the structure in the universe and capturing the total effect of kinematical backreaction , i.e. the effect leading to a deviation from the kinematics of the standard model . speaking in terms of geometry",
    ", we may roughly say that the morphon models the geometrical vacuum degrees of freedom in einstein s theory , which are neglected when modeling the universe with the help of averaged matter sources only .",
    "we call the scalar field a _ morphon _ only if it arises from the proposed mean field description ; we can of course still consider other scalar fields as sources of einstein s equations .",
    "we expect , and we shall demonstrate this for quintessence fields , that the _ morphon _ is capable of acting like any other scalar field model , e.g. , assigned to an inflaton , a curvaton , a dilaton , etc . , depending on our capability to exploit the proposed correspondence , i.e. the possibility to find solutions of the averaged einstein equations and to reconstruct the scalar field potential for this solution .",
    "we here provide a first step that should help to appreciate the various possibilities , but this investigation does not claim to be exhaustive . in this line we are going to choose a minimal parameterization of the scalar field cosmology in the following sense : first , we do not include the cosmological constant and the constant curvature term in the ` friedmannian part ' of the averaged equations , since both arise as subcases of special solutions for the backreaction terms ; second , we choose the simplest foliation ( constant lapse and vanishing shift in the adm ( arnowitt deser misner ) formulation of einstein s equations ) and the simplest matter model ` irrotational dust ' in order to exemplify the correspondence ; third , we realize the correspondence for a particular class of scaling solutions with single  power laws . in this framework",
    "we show that the correspondence holds with a standard minimally coupled scalar field that can play the role of a quintessence field .",
    "if we include the full coordinate degrees of freedom as well as an inhomogeneous pressure source in a perfect fluid energy momentum tensor ( or even imperfect fluid sources ) , more sophisticated scalar field cosmologies would arise .",
    "we comment on this possibility at the end of the paper .",
    "the proposed correspondence can also be inverted , e.g. we may start with a known model of quintessence and try to recover the corresponding solution of the averaged einstein equations .",
    "we shall not exemplify this inversion in the present paper , we just note that free parameters in a given quintessence model can be determined through this correspondence .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls the basic equations and relations needed for the present work .",
    "section 3 sets up the correspondence between kinematical backreaction and scalar field models .",
    "section 4 investigates a family of scaling solutions to the backreaction problem .",
    "section 5 exploits the proposed correspondence .",
    "here we explicitly reconstruct the potential for the scaling solutions , explore the solution space of inhomogeneous cosmologies with the help of the scaling solutions , and discuss some particular cases , which have been advanced before in the literature , and which are now interpreted with the help of a morphon field .",
    "we also give a concrete model and confront it with observational constraints .",
    "section 6 contains a summary and an outlook on possible generalizations .",
    "the averaging problem in relativistic cosmology involves a variety of approaches and problems .",
    "generally , research work in this field deals with averaging inhomogeneities in matter and/or geometry .",
    "mostly , spatial averaging is envisaged , but also averaging on the light ",
    "cone is accessible by some averaging techniques ( compare discussions and references in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . )    in this work we focus on the comparatively simple approach of averaging the scalar parts of einstein s equations on a given foliation of spacetime .",
    "evolution of integral properties of the cosmological model on compact spatial domains can be extracted from einstein s equation without any perturbative assumptions by riemannian volume integration .",
    "the simplest example is the time ",
    "evolution of the volume .",
    "thus , we do not aim at changing the physics of the inhomogeneous cosmological model .",
    "more ambitious and physically different in motivation are averaging strategies that effectively replace the inhomogeneous hypersurfaces and inhomogeneous tensor fields on these hypersurfaces by another , smoothed universe model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these latter techniques lead to further ` intrinsic backreaction ' effects by , e.g. flowing averages on a bumpy geometry to averages on a constant  curvature ` template universe ' as a fitting device .",
    "this can be nicely put into practice using the ricci ",
    "hamilton flow that renormalizes the averaged variables and leads to a ` dressing ' of cosmological parameters by those additional ` backreaction ' terms @xcite,@xcite .    with kinematical averaging we aim at an effective description of the kinematics of the inhomogeneous universe , and we still encounter a number of scalar contributions that add up to the averaged matter sources in an inhomogeneous model ( ` kinematical backreaction terms ' ) as a result of the fact that spatial averaging and time  evolution are non  commuting operations ( not necessarily to be attributed to the nonlinearity of einstein s equations ) . employing a perfect fluid source in the energy momentum tensor , those ` backreaction terms ' comprise a contribution from averaged expansion and shear fluctuations ( i.e. , terms encoding extrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces ) , the averaged 3ricci curvature ( i.e , a term that encodes intrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces ) , an averaged pressure gradient ( or an averaged acceleration divergence ) , and frame fluctuation terms , i.e. coordinate effects ( like the averaged variance of the lapse function in the adm setting ) . in this framework and for vanishing shift , but arbitrary lapse and arbitrary 3metric , the general equations were given in @xcite .",
    "however , we further restrict the analysis to a universe model filled with an irrotational fluid of dust matter @xcite in order to provide the most transparent framework for the purpose of setting up the correspondence with a scalar field cosmology .",
    "we employ a foliation of spacetime into flow ",
    "orthogonal hypersurfaces with the 3metric @xmath0 in the line ",
    "element @xmath1 .",
    "we define the following averager , restricting attention to scalar functions @xmath2 : @xmath3 with @xmath4 ; @xmath0 is an arbitrary metric of the spatial hypersurfaces , and @xmath5 are coordinates that are constant along flow lines , which are here spacetime geodesics . defining a _ volume scale factor _ by the volume @xmath6 of a simply  connected domain @xmath7 in a t ",
    "hypersurface , normalized by the volume of the initial domain @xmath8 , @xmath9 the following exact equations can be derived @xcite ( an overdot denotes partial time ",

    " dependent functions .",

    "derivative of the averaged hamiltonian constraint ( [ averagehamilton ] ) agrees with the averaged raychaudhuri equation ( [ averageraychaudhuri ] ) by virtue of the following _ integrability condition _ : @xmath23 where we have introduced a _ volume hubble functional _ @xmath24 .",
    "the above equations can formally be recast into standard friedmann equations for an effective perfect fluid energy momentum tensor with new effective sources @xcite denotes an ` effective pressure ' ; there is no pressure due to a matter source here .",
    "] : @xmath25 @xmath26 eqs .",
    "( [ effectivefriedmann ] ) correspond to the equations ( [ averageraychaudhuri ] ) , ( [ averagehamilton ] ) and ( [ integrability ] ) , respectively .    given an equation of state of the form @xmath27 that relates the effective sources ( [ equationofstate ] ) with a possible explicit dependence on the volume scale factor ,",
    "the effective friedmann equations ( [ effectivefriedmann ] ) can be solved ( one of the equations ( [ effectivefriedmann ] ) is redundant ) .",
    "therefore , any question posed that is related to the evolution of scalar characteristics of inhomogeneous universe models may be ` reduced ' to finding the _ cosmic state _ on a given spatial scale .",
    "although formally similar to the situation in friedmannian cosmology , here the equation of state depends on the details of the evolution of inhomogeneities . in general it describes non  equilibrium states .",
    "we finally wish to emphasize that these equations are limited to _ regular _ solutions : as in the non  averaged case , the matter model ` dust ' generically leads to shell  crossing singularities . in the averaged equations",
    "this fact would be mirrored in a break of the boundary of the averaging domain or a merging of two boundaries ( legendrian singularities ) , thus inducing a jump of the euler  characteristic of the boundary .",
    "this would especially happen for small collapsing domains and is related to the fragmentation and merging of structures . here , by assumption , the domain @xmath7 must remain simply  connected .",
    "it is possible to cure this small  scale problem by generalizing the matter model ; for example , if multi ",
    "streaming is accounted for , an extra term related to velocity dispersion would add up to the kinematical backreaction term .",
    "such a term can regularize singularities as was discussed in detail within the newtonian framework in @xcite .      for later convenience",
    "we introduce a set of dimensionless average characteristics in terms of which we shall express the solutions : @xmath28 we shall , henceforth , call these characteristics ` parameters ' , but the reader should keep in mind that these are functionals on @xmath7 . expressed through these parameters the averaged hamiltonian constraint ( [ averagehamilton ] ) assumes the form of a ` cosmic quartet ' : @xmath29 in this set , the averaged scalar curvature parameter and the kinematical backreaction parameter are directly expressed through @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in order to compare this pair of parameters with the ` friedmannian curvature parameter ' that is employed to interprete observational data , we can alternatively introduce the pair @xmath32 being related to the previous parameters by @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters arise from inserting the first integral of eq .",
    "( [ integrability ] ) , @xmath34 into ( [ averagehamilton ] ) : @xmath35 this equation is formally equivalent to its newtonian counterpart @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it shows that , by eliminating the averaged curvature , the whole history of the averaged kinematical fluctuations acts as a source of a generalized friedmann equation .    like the volume scale factor @xmath36 and the volume hubble functional @xmath37",
    ", we may introduce ` parameters ' for higher derivatives of the volume scale factor , e.g. the _ volume deceleration functional _",
    "@xmath38 or _ ( volume )  state finders _ @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this paper we shall denote all the parameters evaluated at the initial time by the index @xmath8 , and at the present time by the index @xmath39 .",
    "more details concerning these equations and their solutions may be found in @xcite .",
    "in the above  introduced framework we distinguish the averaged matter source and averaged sources due to geometrical inhomogeneities stemming from extrinsic and intrinsic curvature ( backreaction terms ) .",
    "the averaged equations can be written as standard friedmann equations that are sourced by both .",
    "thus , we have the choice to consider the averaged model as a cosmology with matter source ` morphed ' by a mean field that is generated by backreaction terms",
    ". we shall demonstrate below that this introduction of a ` morphon field ' provides a natural description .",
    "we say ` natural ' , because the form of the effective sources in eq .",
    "( [ equationofstate ] ) shows that , for vanishing averaged scalar curvature , backreaction obeys a stiff equation of state as suggested by the fluid analogy with a free scalar field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we also model the averaged curvature by an effective scalar field potential , we find that the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) provides the evolution equation for the scalar field in this potential , and it is identical to the klein  gordon equation , as we explain now .",
    "we now propose to model the effective sources arising from geometrical degrees of freedom due to backreaction ( i.e. , roughly the ` vacuum ' part of the effective equations ) by a scalar field @xmath40 evolving in an effective potential @xmath41 for the potential to avoid confusion with the volume functional . ] , both domain  dependent , as follows ( recall that we have no matter pressure source here ) : @xmath42 with @xcite , @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 for a standard scalar field ( with positive kinetic energy ) , and @xmath45 for a phantom scalar field ( with negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "thus , in view of eq .",
    "( [ equationofstate ] ) , we obtain the following correspondence : @xmath46    we see that the averaged scalar curvature directly represents the potential , whereas the kinematical backreaction term represents ` kinetic energy density ' directly , if the averaged scalar curvature vanishes .",
    "this representation of @xmath14 is physically sensible , since it expresses a balance between ` kinetic energy ' @xmath47 and ` potential energy ' @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 we obtain the ` virial condition ' , and for positive potentials the sign @xmath50 ( phantom energy ) is suggested from the scalar virial theorem @xmath51 . ]",
    "@xmath52 , and so kinematical backreaction is identified as causing deviations from ` equilibrium ' ( defined through this balance ) .",
    "note that friedmann ",
    "lematre cosmologies correspond to the vanishing of @xmath14 ( established ` virial equilibrium ' or vanishing relative information entropy according to @xcite ) _ on all scales_. the scale  dependent formulation allows to identify states in ` virial equilibrium ' on particular spatial scales .",
    "below we learn that this ` virial balance ' can be stable _ or _ unstable .    inserting ( [ correspondence1 ] ) into the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) then implies that @xmath40 , for @xmath53 , obeys the klein ",
    "gordon equation : @xmath54 with this correspondence the backreaction effect is formally equivalent to the dynamics of a homogeneous , minimally coupled scalar field . given this correspondence",
    "we can try to reconstruct the potential in which the morphon field evolves .",
    "note that there are two equations of state in this approach , one for the morphon , @xmath55 , and the total ` cosmic equation of state ' including the matter source term , @xmath56 .",
    "it is also worth noting that a usual scalar field source in a friedmannian model , attributed e.g. to phantom quintessence that leads to acceleration , will violate the _ strong energy condition _",
    "@xmath57 , i.e. : @xmath58 and actually also the _ weak energy condition _",
    "@xmath59 , while for a morphon field both are not violated for the true content of the universe , that is ordinary dust matter .",
    "it is interesting that we can write a ` strong energy condition ' for the effective sources , i.e. : @xmath60 while we do not need ` exotic matter ' , the above condition will be ` violated ' in order to have volume acceleration , @xmath61 @xcite , @xcite , _ cf . _",
    "subsection  [ subsubsect : accelerationconditions ] .      in the newtonian limit @xcite",

    "in particular , this remark applies to cosmological n ",
    "body simulations : by construction , these simulations enforce ` virial equilibrium ' of the morphon energies on the scale of the simulation box .",
    "the newtonian framework also offers a concise explanation of our choice ` morphon field ' : the kinematical backreaction term @xmath14 can be entirely expressed through minkowski functionals @xcite of the boundary of the averaging domain @xcite .",
    "these functionals form a complete basis in the space of ( minkowski)additive measures for the morphometry of spatial sets .",
    "let us give a simple example . as shown in @xcite , subsect .",
    "3.2 ( also advanced as a motivation case in @xcite ) , the effective source @xmath14 may act as a cosmological constant .",
    "the general condition for the corresponding exact solution of the effective friedmann equations ( [ effectivefriedmann ] ) ( with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) is @xmath65 ; @xmath66 ; e.g. , for @xmath67 we have : @xmath68 the kinematical backreaction term assumes a constant value @xmath69 , and the morphon potential mimics a ( scale  dependent ) cosmological constant .",
    "note that the averaged curvature is non  zero , @xmath70 , so that simultaneously the morphon unavoidably installs a non  zero averaged scalar curvature .",
    "we shall now exemplify this correspondence for a new class of scaling solutions that contains this and other known subcases .",
    "in the following , we shall study a class of solutions that prescribes backreaction and averaged curvature functionals in the form of scaling laws of the volume scale factor @xmath71 .",
    "if not explicitly stated otherwise , we restrict attention to the case @xmath64 throughout , and treat the cosmological constant as a particular morphon .      in this subsection we shall present a systematic classification of scaling behaviors for the cosmological models introduced previously .",
    "the averaged dust matter density @xmath72 evolves , for a restmass preserving domain @xmath7 , as @xmath73 .",
    "let us suppose that the backreaction term and the averaged curvature also obey scaling laws , that is : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the initial values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively .    rewriting the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) ,",
    "@xmath77 a first scaling solution of that equation is obviously provided by ( @xcite appendix b ) : @xmath78     scaling law @xmath79 for the backreaction as a function of the parameter @xmath80.,width=377 ]    moreover , this is clearly the only solution with @xmath81 . in the case @xmath82 , we define a new ` backreaction parameter ' @xmath83 ( that can be chosen differently for a chosen domain of averaging and simply write @xmath80 . ] ) such that @xmath84 ; the solution reads : @xmath85 where ( _ cf . _",

    "lematre cosmologies .",
    "this limiting case also appears in the relations among the cosmological parameters , discussed after the next subsection .      the solution ( [ ndiffpsolution ] ) corresponds to the case where the backreaction and the averaged scalar curvature evolve independently , leading to an averaged curvature similar to a constant ` friedmannian curvature ' and an additional term that scales as @xmath89 .",
    "as the universe model expands , this solution is rapidly equivalent to a pure constant curvature term , we may say that this solution represents ( and maintains ) a near  friedmannian state ( @xmath14 decays much more rapidly @xmath90 compared with the averaged density @xmath91 ) .",
    "therefore , we shall not model this solution by a scalar field when describing the late  time dust  dominated universe .",
    "it is interesting to note that this solution exhibits the same late  time behavior as the long  wavelength part of the solution found through the gradient expansion approximation scheme in @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "the solutions ( [ backreactionparameter ] ) entail a strong coupling between kinematical backreaction and averaged scalar curvature .",
    "the coupling itself must be considered a generic property ; it has been identified as being responsible for a much slower decay of kinematical fluctuations in an expanding universe model on the cost of averaged scalar curvature .",
    "this is a genuinly relativistic property .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that it is this possibility which is needed for an explanation of dark energy through backreaction today , provided the initial conditions are appropriate .",
    "the scaling solutions ( [ backreactionparameter ] ) can be employed to represent generic features of backreaction or curvature  dominated cosmologies ( while density fluctuations must not be large ) .",
    "such cosmologies may significantly deviate from a standard friedmann cosmology with regard to the temporal evolution of their parameters .",
    "we note that , even if deviations in the volume scale factor @xmath36 at a final time may not be large , deviations in in its history , i.e. its time  derivatives , in particular its second time  derivative related to the cosmological parameters , may be large ( this insight is a result of a detailed analysis in newtonian cosmology @xcite ) .",
    "let us make a general remark concerning the solution subspace of the scaling solutions given above .",
    "we appreciate that the polynomial nature of ( [ prescription ] ) , together with the form of the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) , implies that any linear combination of these solutions provides a new solution . in particular , one can always add a constant curvature term to a particular solution .",
    "we also infer that only the case @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) implies a ( scale  dependent ) ` friedmannian ' evolution of the ( physical ) curvature parameter @xmath94 .",
    "only the singular case @xmath88 would imply a vanishing ` friedmannian ' curvature parameter ( see below ) . if we would require @xmath88 on all scales , then the model reduces to the euclidean case ( everywhere vanishing 3ricci curvature ) .",
    "we resume this discussion in the next section with the help of concrete examples .",
    "there we also provide an illustration and further discussion of the subspace defined by the scaling solutions .    finally let us note that , while the scaling solutions and scenarios investigated here and below satisfy the averaged equations of motions , these models are still phenomenological and not derived non ",
    "perturbatively from the fundamental theory , i.e. there is no guarantee that corresponding realistic solutions of the original inhomogeneous einstein equations could be found that satisfy the assumed scaling laws .",

    "( [ omegascaling2 ] ) now explicitly shows that the generally held view that @xmath99 models the averaged curvature is a misperception : as soon as kinematical backreaction is relevant ( itself or its time  history ) , the averaged curvature may evolve very differently compared with a constant  curvature model .",
    "evaluating ( [ omegascaling2 ] ) at initial time , we find that initial data differ only by the parameter @xmath80 in this class of solutions , which eases their observational determination : @xmath100 since in the sum @xmath101 , the ` newtonian ' parameter @xmath102 , _ cf .",

    "this is possible for the particular class of scaling solutions we consider ( we have numerically evaluated the evolution for the volume scale factor below ) ; in general it requires a detailed model for the evolution of inhomogeneities .    finally , we emphasize that the above relations are a result of our ` single  scaling ' model ansatz .",
    "more flexible models arise by superimposing scaling solutions ( and so modeling the dynamics more realistically ) .",
    "the relation ( [ constraininglambda ] ) is a consequence of this : in general , initial data for the 3ricci curvature and the integration constant @xmath113 can be independently chosen .",

    "since quintessence models aim at mimicking a repulsive component in the cosmological evolution , it is natural that a ` working model ' of quintessence would , via the proposed correspondence of a ` morphon  quintessence ' , also lead to a ` working model ' of backreaction . for the purpose of concretizing the correspondence , let us now consider solutions of the type ( [ backreactionparameter ] )",

    "indeed , the kinetic term of the scalar field can be expressed in terms of @xmath123 , and this equation can be explicitly integrated , for @xmath124 , leading to : @xmath125 where we have defined the fraction @xmath126 of the curvature and density parameters : @xmath127 in this relation , necessarily , @xmath128 and @xmath87 .",
    "we immediately find that @xmath129 is an increasing function of @xmath36 .",
    "then , inverting that relation and inserting the result into the expression for the potential , we obtain the explicit form of the self  interaction term of the scalar field : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the initial averaged restmass density of dust matter , and where the restrictions introduced above still hold , with the new constraint @xmath132 . to sum up , in order to obtain a consistent description in terms of a _ real  valued _ scalar field , we must have @xmath118 and @xmath44 for @xmath133 , and @xmath117 for @xmath134 , with @xmath45 , if @xmath135 and @xmath44 , if @xmath121 .",
    "one can immediately notice that the energy scale of the scalar field potential is determined by the averaged matter density : the scales that determine the scalar field dynamics are fixed by the matter distribution . as a result of our correspondence to quintessence models and in view of many results that were obtained in this field , the above potential can also be found in @xcite ( their eq .",

    "the correspondence given by equations ( [ phi / a ] ) and ( [ pot1 ] ) holds in the presence of a non  vanishing matter field , but one can also reconstruct the scalar field cosmology for the vacuum . setting @xmath136 in the equations ( [ averagehamilton ] ) and ( [ averagefriedmann ] ) , and applying the same procedure as the one described above , one finds : @xmath137 up to the renormalization factor @xmath138 that reflects the presence of matter , this is exactly the solution ( [ pot1 ] ) in the case @xmath139 .",
    "as noted above , the morphon field can be interpreted as representing the effect of the averaged geometrical degrees of freedom ; then the comparison of its potential in the presence of matter and in the vacuum tells us , how the matter field influences the backreaction terms : it affects the energy scale through a simple factor depending on the initial averaged matter density , and so modifies the dynamics of the morphon when the domain volume is small ( because @xmath140 is an increasing function of @xmath71 ; the limit @xmath141 corresponds to @xmath142 . ) on the contrary , when the domain volume becomes big , the dynamics of backreaction is similar to its dynamics in vacuum , which is natural because the averaged matter density is then diluted .",

    "the above three cases appear as limiting cases of the scalar field model .",

    "we are going to estimate this ratio from observational constraints on the equation of state .",
    "before we do so , let us summarize the conditions relevant for a late  time behavior featuring ` volume acceleration ' , i.e. @xmath229 .      the condition for an accelerating patch @xmath7 ( which we are going to take as large as our observable universe ) follows from the averaged raychaudhuri equation ( [ averageraychaudhuri ] ) @xcite , @xcite : @xmath230 implying with ( [ omega ] ) and ( [ deceleration ] ) : @xmath231 and , for the class of scaling solutions ( [ neqpsolution ] ) ( @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and the definition ( [ gammar ] ) ) : @xmath234 this condition is met , if ( now inserting the solution ( [ gammar ] ) and the relation to the friedmannian curvature parameter ( [ gammak ] ) ) : @xmath235 a realistic model would meet this condition at some time in the evolution leading thereafter to the observed acceleration value , i.e. ideally at the epoch around the time of structure formation solving the coincidence problem .    from",

    "the kinematical backreaction have identical decay rates with respect to the volume scale factor in an expanding universe model .",
    "this means that , in order to get a positive acceleration at the present time , already the initial data must satisfy the conditions ( [ accelerationcondition1 ] ) and ( [ accelerationcondition2 ] ) .",
    "the necessary initial value for kinematical backreaction is then large and suggests that we are looking at a region @xmath245 that is close to satisfy the condition needed for the stationarity of the cosmos .",
    "note , however , that the strict single  scaling solution @xmath243 ( @xmath144 ) does not admit acceleration , _ cf . _ eq .",
    "( [ decelerationscaling ] ) , but a superimposed regional fluctuation would admit acceleration ( or deceleration ) ( _ cf . _ appendix a ) .    in the cases",
    "@xmath244 , the averaged density decays faster than kinematical backreaction ; hence , to attain sufficient acceleration today , the model needs the less magnitude of kinematical backreaction the weaker its decay given in terms of @xmath79 .",
    "let us take a case close to @xmath93 ( the case @xmath93 degenerates to @xmath92 , _ cf . _ eq .  ( [ neqpsolution ] ) ) , then kinematical backreaction can be three orders of magnitude weaker initially , if the scale factor advanced to a value of @xmath246 today .",
    "this remark makes clear that the solution sector @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) contains solutions that can potentially explain the dark energy problem even when starting with small expansion fluctuations at the cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) epoch .",
    "moreover , it contains solutions which also solve the coincidence problem , although a more natural solution would not be an exact scaling solution , but one that would inject more backreaction at the formation epoch of structure .",

    "_ eq .  ( [ decelerationscaling ] )",
    ", we have to go to values of @xmath250 ( @xmath251 ) in order to find _ sufficient _ acceleration .",
    "it should be emphasized that the interesting sector @xmath247 is _ not _ what we could find in a weakly perturbed frw ( friedmann robertson walker ) model .",
    "these states rely on a strong coupling of kinematical fluctuations to the averaged scalar curvature of the universe model .",
    "kinematical backreaction can only decay at such weak rates ( or even grow for @xmath120 ) , if the time  evolution of the averaged scalar curvature largely deviates from the time ",
    "evolution of a constant curvature model ; intuitively speaking , averaged fluctuations are strongly supplied by the ` curvature energy reservoir ' .",
    "recall that the envisaged class of single  scaling solutions implies that our parameter choices are unambiguous : we only have to specify an initial condition , say @xmath252 or @xmath253 , the backreaction parameter @xmath80 , and the value of the volume scale factor today @xmath112 .",
    "the following estimates are done on the assumption that the effective model is based on solutions for a matter density source and a morphon field that is realized by the particular class of scaling solutions discussed in this paper .",
    "we focus on the effect of the morphon field for vanishing cosmological constant , and would like to demonstrate that an observer who is using a friedmannian ` template universe model ' would interprete this effect by a cosmological constant _",
    "today_. thus , we are _ forcing _ the effective evolution of the volume scale factor to match with that of a friedmannian model with @xmath223 at initial and final time .",

    "in particular , this implies that the time ",
    "derivatives of the volume scale factor evolve very differently compared with a standard friedmannian model .",
    "thanks to the existing constraints on the standard friedmannian models , as for example cold dark matter models with a dark energy component that has a constant equation of state , this procedure reduces the number of parameters that we have to estimate .",
    "indeed , we then only have to determine @xmath80 and one value for the initial data , e.g. @xmath252 .",
    "we emphasize that the interpretation of observational data and the resulting constraints strongly depend on model assumptions , i.e. it is commonly assumed that a standard @xmath254 model is the correct one .",
    "this implies , in particular , that we are not constraining the parameters of the averaged inhomogeneous model by observations reinterpreted within the inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "for example , since the spatial curvature is not constant , the formulae for angular diameter and luminosity distances can not be taken as the frw ones .",
    "furthermore , we point out that this reinterpretation is challenging , for all the other observational predictions that are based on a perturbative approach , like large  scale structure characteristics , must be reconsidered .",
    "it is not obvious , and this work together with others ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) provides plausible counter arguments , that the _ late universe _ could be described by a perturbed frw model , even if smoothed over large scales .    in this sense ,",
    "our analysis is a demonstration of what the observed values of the standard cosmological parameters would imply for the averaged quantities .    with these assumptions",

    "our proposal of a mean field description of backreaction effects through a minimally coupled ` morphon field ' , does not only provide a rephrasing of the kinematics of backreaction in terms of a scalar field cosmology , but it also justifies existence of the latter due to the fact that we identify averaged inhomogeneities in einstein gravity as the underlying fundamental physics . thus far ,",
    "such a well  defined link was missing ; alternatively , it is thought and there exist some plausible hints that the low  energy scale in some contemporary particle physics models would provide this link ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. that the scalar field emerges from the dynamical degrees of freedom stemming from extra dimensions ( ` moduli fields ' ) .",
    "the set of spatially averaged equations together with the mean field description of kinematical backreaction by a morphon field shows , in particular , that the framework of friedmann  type equations is very robust .",
    "we understand now that an effective and scale  dependent friedmannian framework is applicable with the surprising new input that , besides averaged matter sources , also a scalar field component emerges and has not to be invented .",
    "we have exploited the proposed correspondence by investigating a family of scaling solutions of the backreaction terms .",
    "the study of scaling solutions is well  advanced in research work on scalar field models , and our study allows to translate those results into the backreaction context . here , our discussion was not exhaustive . we concentrated on exploring the solution space of inhomogeneous cosmologies with the help of scaling solutions with a ` minimal ' parameterization .",
    "therefore , as a next step , this parameterization could be expanded and congruences with other work on scalar field models could be worked out . note that an obvious such expansion would analyze superimposed scaling solutions that could be modeled either again by a single effective scalar field , or else by multiple scalar fields @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one example of a superposition of scaling solutions is provided in appendix a. furthermore , observational constraints set on quintessence or phantom quintessence models have direct relevance to constraints that have to be set on morphon fields @xcite .",
    "however , observations have to be reinterpreted within the inhomogeneous cosmology underlying the morphon dynamics .",
    "in making the correspondence concrete we have not touched the question whether realistic dynamical models of the inhomogeneous universe would comply with the class of averaged models that we singled out as ` realistic case studies ' . for the scaling solutions",
    "the scalar field correspondence revealed , that the constancy of the fraction of kinetic to potential energy of the morphon field relates to averaged models that are driven by strong coupling between averaged 3ricci curvature and kinematical fluctuations , the constancy implying their direct proportionality .",
    "while in the scalar field context this assumption is often employed , here we get an interesting picture of what this represents .",
    "the key for a physical interpretation of the proposed correspondence is the equivalence of the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) and the klein ",
    "gordon equation ( [ kleingordon ] ) : @xmath308 although the resulting picture may appear complex , it can be structured by looking at a single player : the averaged 3ricci curvature . if it is positive , it represents an energy reservoir , stored in a negative potential in the correspondence .",
    "if this reservoir exceeds the ` virial energy ' , then the excess energy is converted ( in the scaling solutions directly ) into an excess of kinetic energy , i.e. kinematical backreaction .",
    "the averaged curvature then decays faster than the ` friedmannian ' curvature . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is negative , then the same logic applies : the averaged curvature consequently becomes stronger negative compared with the ` friedmannian ' curvature .",
    "solutions of the dark energy problem , where a large positive value of backreaction is needed , will have to make strong use of this conversion , while ` near  friedmannian ' models do nt . a newtonian or post ",
    "newtonian approach suppresses these degrees of freedom by freezing the averaged curvature to the ` friedmannian ' value ( compare an attempt to work with the friedmannian curvature parameter that , of course , needs an extra scalar field as a source for dark energy @xcite ) . from these remarks",
    "we understand the importance of a strongly evolving averaged 3ricci curvature , if the attempt to explain dark energy through backreaction should be successful . in this line",
    "there is clear support for the importance of a strongly evolving 3ricci curvature from the lematre  tolman ",
    "bondi solution , see @xcite , and in particular the recent work @xcite and references to other papers on this solution therein .",
    "recently , rsnen @xcite provided an illustrative example and a comprehensive discussion of the physics of backreaction  driven accelerated expansion .",
    "weakly perturbed friedmann models have a special status if placed into the full solution space of the averaged inhomogeneous models : only if the averaged fluctuations _ decouple _ from the averaged curvature ,",
    "i.e. if they evolve independently , then the averaged curvature evolves as a constant ` friedmannian ' curvature , and fluctuations decay in proportion to the square of the inverse volume .",
    "hints that point to the likely existence of a curvature  fluctuation  coupling come again from averaging the ltb solution @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and other global solutions @xcite that all show an extra term in the averaged scalar curvature . in these examples the extra term evolves in proportion to the inverse volume , hence deviates from a ` friedmannian ' curvature and implies maintainance of large kinematical fluctuations that decay only in proportion to the inverse volume .",
    "while this particular behavior of the backreaction terms still requires large backreaction to start with @xcite , e.g. a feature of globally stationary solutions @xcite , a stronger evolution of averaged curvature , i.e. injecting more curvature energy into kinematical fluctuations , would allow to start with ` near  friedmannian ' initial conditions and still explain current observations .",
    "an example for the latter possibility has been analyzed in this paper .",
    "this possibility can be interpreted such that there is some hope to find enough backreaction by starting with almost frw initial data , as suggested by @xcite , although here the conversion of curvature energy into backreaction must be very efficient ; a more moderate evolution into backreaction  dominated phases would result , if we already start with ` out  of  equilibrium ' initial data .",
    "in this line we have also pointed out , and this is worth stressing again , that the ` friedmannian ' curvature parameter @xmath113 is in general unrelated to the physical averaged scalar curvature , it is an integration constant and actually an integral of motion @xcite : the dynamics of the averaged physical curvature is not represented by and , in most examples , deviates substantially from it .",
    "the restriction to a ` friedmannian ' evolution of the averaged curvature singles out the special case where the curvature  fluctuation  coupling is _ strictly absent_.    summarizing these thoughts we can say that there are two conceivable scenarios that remove the need for dark energy : first , a ` soft scenario ' that was discussed in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we already have an initial global state with strong expansion fluctuations , so that regionally a moderate evolution of backreaction and averaged curvature suffices to explain the observed acceleration .",
    "it was , however , pointed out that such models imply paradigmatic changes , and observational data have to be reinterpreted in order to put firm constraints on @xmath14 at the cmb epoch .",
    "second , there is a ` hard scenario ' ( implied by the suggestion of kolb et al .",
    "@xcite ) that literally creates enough backreaction out of ` nothing ' , _ cf . _",
    "( [ earlydarkenergy ] ) . in our example of a particular scaling solution",
    "a phantom quintessence scenario arises that complies with the strong energy condition and also with constraints in accord with those already put on the standard model .",
    "consequently , this scenario needs strong evolution of backreaction and averaged curvature as seen best for the dimensionless cosmological parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegassnls ] .",
    "the present work has shown that the ` hard ' version can be made consistent with the framework of the averaged einstein equations .",
    "there are obviously a number of possible routes for generalizing the scalar field correspondence .",
    "let us briefly discuss some of them .",
    "spatial averages are scale  dependent , since we integrate over a given compact volume of the space sections . in this paper",
    "we left the domain  dependence untouched , all of our considerations were focussing on a fixed scale .",
    "however , the scalar field correspondence holds on every scale , which is not only reminiscent of , but also physically a manifestation of renormalizable quantities . in this respect",
    "the morphon analogues of quintessence are different from standard quintessence models . in this context",
    "we could ` ricci flow ' the averages to averages on a constant curvature geometry @xcite , or we could study other renormalization group methods to control the scale  dependence , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    a possibly fruitful investigation would consider string  motivated gravitational theories and , employing the proposed correspondence , would aim at determining the scalar field theory from the higher  dimensional geometry of extrinsic and intrinsic curvature .",
    "for this end one would have to derive the averaged equations for the extended spacetime .",
    "brane world cosmologies could be analyzed in the spirit of this correspondence . not only in this context",
    "it will be interesting to understand , in which cases a non  minimally coupled morphon field would arise .",
    "furthermore , there are other interesting strategies of a more technical nature that , however , widen the physical context of applications . for example , the introduction of a complex scalar field , which is necessary to access solutions with @xmath309 with a positive averaged 3ricci curvature ; the discussion of globally stationary cosmologies in @xcite shows that a stationary cosmos obeys these conditions at early times , and later the averaged scalar curvature decreases fast until it becomes negative , while maintaining large kinematical backreaction .",
    "another example is the averaging on a different foliation of spacetime , i.e. introducing coordinate degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter is actually necessary if matter sources other than ` irrotational dust ' are considered ; it results in an extra coupling of the scalar field to the matter sources stemming from a backreaction term due to the pressure gradient that is absent in the present paper @xcite .",
    "this is the subject of a follow  up work that will also allow access to realistic models of backreaction ",
    "driven inflation @xcite . here , the present investigation in principle allows to model inflationary scenarios too by translating typical characteristics of inflaton fields into corresponding morphon fields , however , within the restricted cases of ` dust matter ' or ` vacuum ' .    since @xmath40 models the inhomogeneous ` vacuum part ' of the sources",
    ", there might be an interesting connection to the energy budget of gravitational waves that could be fruitfully exploited @xcite , and , since @xmath40 represents a ` mean field ' of fluctuations , also a connection to statistical thermodynamics is implicit . in order to establish this latter link , however ,",
    "we have to note that @xmath14 models the averaged spatial variance of extrinsic curvature and so far not ` fluctuations ' in the thermodynamical sense . another intimate , but on the level of a ` dust matter model ' formal , relation to effective thermodynamic models is suggested in the case of imperfect fluid models .",
    "they imply non  equilibrium effects that in turn can be associated with a ` friction coefficient ' proportional to the ` cosmic equation of state ' @xmath310 .",
    "thermodynamic arguments that were used in @xcite within the imperfect fluid picture lead to further possibilities of interpreting the different scaling regimes , e.g. by employing the second law of thermodynamics the authors of @xcite would conclude @xmath311 , and thus @xmath312 , i.e. @xmath313 for positive averaged scalar curvature and @xmath314 for negative one . since the first case does not give rise to acceleration one would be led to conclude that the scalar curvature has to be negative on average , a conclusion shared by other work ( in appendix a we also reach this conclusion and provide references ) .    a final comment related to scalar field perturbations , often investigated in a post  newtonian setting , is in order . in those perturbative approaches ,",
    "the scalar degree of freedom that emerges is a combination of matter and metric inhomogeneities . within the well  developed standard perturbation theory @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to first restrict the analysis to a tight range around a frw background in order to calculate backreaction effects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of scalar perturbations , but also their derivatives and , hence , all curvature terms have to be small @xcite .",
    "besides considerations of long  wavelength perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the analysis of sub  horizon perturbations with the aim to explain dark energy in a perturbative setting is the focus of many recent research papers and , here , we do not enter into the details of these works .",
    "we wish to point out two aspects that emerged from the present investigation , and which may be relevant for future strategies in a perturbation analysis .",
    "first , we address the averaging issue : a post ",
    "newtonian approximation may ( and in most cases of cosmological relevance will ) be adequate _ locally _ or piecewise on a small range of scales . however , as soon as we are looking at integral properties , i.e. integrating out a wider range of scales , its applicability should be verified . in standard perturbation theory spatial averages are taken with respect to a ` background observer ' . since a major player in the mechanism that can produce large kinematical fluctuations",
    "is the averaged 3ricci curvature , we have to be careful in relating euclidean ` background averages ' to the riemannian volume averages that govern the dynamics of the averaged cosmology .",
    "second , in the present approach we do not specify a metric of the space sections ; the formulation and the correspondence holds for arbitrary 3metrics .",
    "also , when we spoke about a ` scale  dependent friedmannian model ' , we referred to the kinematics of the volume scale factor , we did not refer to the frw metric .",
    "we can , however , specify a spatial metric to establish a dynamical model . here",
    ", we think that the metric setting must allow for large deviations of the 3ricci curvature from the constant friedmannian curvature . as a ` rule of thumb ' ( another",
    "was recently given in @xcite for super ",
    "hubble perturbations ) , we may say : _ if the averaged scalar curvature evolves at or near the constant curvature model , then there is no hope to model cases that lead to enough late  time acceleration .",
    "_    a future strategy related to perturbation theory could be motivated by newtonian cosmological models for structure formation : in the newtonian framework , an eulerian perturbation theory does not provide access to the highly non  linear regime .",
    "instead , the lagrangian point of view offers a way to move with the largely perturbed fluid .",
    "a relativistic lagrangian perturbative approach is currently worked out aiming at generalizing the newtonian work @xcite that has employed the exact averaged equations to construct a non  perturbative model for inhomogeneities out of perturbatively calculated fluctuations . a lagrangian perturbation scheme itself",
    "does not include non  perturbative features , that may be needed in this context ; non  perturbative effects have been recently discussed in the newtonian framework @xcite .",
    "all these efforts aim at constructing a generic evolution model .",
    "the morphon field is an effective description without any perturbative assumption .",
    "but , one would like to establish the underlying inhomogeneous dynamics in order to understand , to what the realistic case studies that ` explain away ' the dark energy problem actually correspond .",

    "a particular scaling behavior of the solutions ( [ neqpsolution ] ) , in which kinematical backreaction and averaged scalar curvature are proportional , can be exploited to define a mapping of the solutions ( [ neqpsolution ] ) for the particular case @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath243 , to a friedmannian cosmology .",
    "before we explain this mapping let us recall that the case @xmath144 also arises for the stationarity condition , required in @xcite for the global scale ( extending the domain @xmath7 to the whole ( compact ) manifold @xmath315 , and setting @xmath64 ) : @xmath316 this condition implies either a globally static model or a globally stationary model featuring the solution : @xmath317 where @xmath318 with : @xmath319 .",
    "the relation to a friedmannian ` fitting model ' arises by noting that , in order to obtain the above solution , we do not need to assume the stationarity condition ( [ globalstationarity ] ) .",
    "indeed , inserting the scaling solutions ( [ neqpsolution ] ) into the averaged equations ( [ averageraychaudhuri ] ) and ( [ averagehamilton ] ) on any given domain @xmath7 , and superimposing a constant curvature solution to the averaged curvature , we obtain ( restricting again attention to @xmath195 ) : @xmath320 we find that , for the special case @xmath144 , we can simply redefine the initial constants , @xmath321 where @xmath322 and @xmath222 denote the resulting dimensionless functionals which we are going to use as friedmannian ` fitting parameters ' , so that eqs .",
    "( [ averagef ] ) assume the form of a constant(negative ) curvature friedmannian model .",
    "let us exemplify this correspondence .",
    "setting @xmath323 in accord with the current observational results , we have @xmath324 throughout the evolution , i.e. a scale  dependent einstein  de sitter model : @xmath325 suppose now that we ` fit ' a standard einstein ",
    "de sitter model on some given scale @xmath7 to observational data , we would be in the position to evaluate the physical ` parameters ' on that scale to be @xmath326 , i.e. for @xmath327 today , we would conclude that there must be backreaction at work and it should be positive ( negative kinematical backreaction mimicking a ` kinematical dark matter ' source ) , @xmath328 , and that the ( physical ) curvature parameter would be positive too ( negative averaged curvature ) , @xmath329 . we emphasise that the friedmannian curvature parameter is assumed to vanish , which demonstrates that it has nothing to do with the ( evolving ) averaged scalar curvature of the inhomogeneous model .",
    "the above procedure exemplifies the possibility of constructing a ( non  naive ) friedmannian fitting model . it , however , assumes that , regionally , the model obeys an einstein  de sitter kinematics ( unrelated to an underlying frw metric ) , and @xmath330 is ` typical ' for the regional universe .",
    "both are not in accord with what we expect . we would ` fit ' a friedmannian model _ with _ a cosmological constant , which is the currently held view of the ` concordance model ' , @xmath331 then we would have to superimpose a solution @xmath332 with , e.g. , @xmath333 to the above solution ( this could still be interpreted as a deviation from a representative volume of a global model with @xmath144 ) .",
    "this implies , with @xmath334 , @xmath335 , and @xmath336 that @xmath337 we would find a positive backreaction with @xmath338 ( modeling now dark energy ) , and a negative averaged scalar curvature with @xmath339 , indicating that the regional universe should correspond to a ` void ' within a global model with @xmath340 . that our regional universe could correspond to a regional ` void '",
