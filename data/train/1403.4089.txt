    "the likely discovery of astrophysical high - energy neutrinos has recently been reported from data acquired with the gton neutrino detector , icecube . in 2012 , two pev shower events were reported from the combined ic-79/ic-86 data period , and a recent follow - up analysis of the same data enabled the icecube collaboration to find 26 additional events at lower energies  @xcite . interestingly , for a @xmath8 spectrum , the observed diffuse neutrino intensity @xmath9 ( per flavor ) is consistent with the waxman - bahcall bound  @xcite , which provides a benchmark intensity for neutrino astrophysics .",
    "this intensity is much higher than the nucleus - survival bound for sources of high - energy heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "high - energy neutrinos give an unambiguous signal of high - energy cosmic - ray ( cr ) acceleration , and a few pev neutrinos probe crs whose energy is @xmath10  pev per nucleon above the _ knee _ of the cr spectrum at @xmath11  pev .",
    "these results begin to open a new window on the high - energy astroparticle universe .",
    "various possibilities have been proposed to explain the icecube signal ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "galactic scenarios are being constrained by various cr experiments  @xcite .",
    "possible isotropic galactic emission models have also been constrained by the diffuse @xmath4-ray background measured by _",
    "fermi _ , as well as sub - pev @xmath4-ray searches  @xcite . since there is no significant anisotropy toward the galactic center , extragalactic scenarios are the most natural (",
    "although a fraction of the neutrino events could come from galactic sources ) . in any astrophysical scenario , high - energy neutrinos are produced by hadronuclear ( e.g. , @xmath12 )  @xcite or photohadronic ( e.g. , @xmath13 )  @xcite interactions . in @xmath12 scenarios , as predicted before the icecube discovery  @xcite , an enhanced intensity of neutrino signals above the cr - induced atmospheric background intensity in the icecube data can be explained by galaxy groups and clusters , and star - forming galaxies  @xcite .",
    "galaxy groups and clusters host active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , galaxy mergers , and have accretion and intracluster shocks , and it is plausible that they are _ reservoirs _ of @xmath10  pev crs .",
    "crs with @xmath10  pev energies could also be produced in starburst galaxies with strong magnetic fields  @xcite and/or by special accelerators , such as broadline type ibc supernovae  @xcite and interaction - powered supernovae  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath13 scenarios , which naturally include candidate source classes of ultrahigh - energy crs ( uhecrs ) , include agn  @xcite and @xmath4-ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite .",
    "for agn , icecube already put interesting constraints on original predictions of various models . for grbs , although their neutrino production efficiency can still be consistent with the icecube signal , stacking analyses by icecube have given interesting limits on this possibility  @xcite .",
    "different grb classes , such as low - luminosity grbs  @xcite , are possible as viable explanations of the icecube data , and they may give contributions larger than that from classical long - duration and short - duration grbs  @xcite .",
    "agn are powered by supermassive black holes , and @xmath14% of them are accompanied by relativistic jets .",
    "they are the most prominent extragalactic sources in @xmath4 rays .",
    "a significant fraction of the diffuse @xmath4-ray background is attributed to blazars whose jets are pointing towards us . imaging atmospheric cerenkov telescopes and the recent _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope",
    "have discovered many bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) ( for a review , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , radio galaxies that are misaligned by large angles to the jet axis and thought to be the parent population of blazars in the geometrical unification scenario  @xcite , are also an important class of @xmath4-ray sources .",
    "the blazar class has been investigated over many years as sources of uhecrs and neutrinos  @xcite .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazar jets is usually modeled by nonthermal synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation from relativistic leptons , although hadronic emissions may also contribute to the @xmath4-ray spectra ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the seds of blazars evolve with luminosity , as described by the so - called blazar sequence ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the blazar sequence has recently been exploited to systematically evaluate contributions of bl lac objects and quasar - hosted blazars ( qhbs ) ( including steep spectrum radio quasars as well as fsrqs ) to the diffuse @xmath4-ray background  @xcite .",
    "besides the jet component , typical quasars  including qhbs  show broad optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines that originate from the broadline regions ( blrs ) found near supermassive black holes .",
    "the blr also plays a role in scattering radiation emitted by the accretion disk that feeds matter onto the black hole .",
    "in addition , the pc - scale dust torus surrounding the galactic nucleus is a source of infrared ( ir ) radiation that provides target photons for very high - energy crs .    in this work , we study high - energy neutrino production in the inner jets of radio - loud agn , and examine the effects of external photon fields on neutrino production in blazars .",
    "we use the blazar sequence to derive the diffuse neutrino intensity from the inner jets .",
    "we show that the cumulative neutrino background , if from radio - loud agn , is dominated by the most luminous qhbs . this implies a cross correlation between astrophysical neutrinos with @xmath7  pev energies and bright , luminous fsrqs found by _",
    "fermi_.    in previous works on the diffuse neutrino intensity",
    "@xcite , only the jet and accretion - disk components were considered as target photons , but here we show that @xmath13 interactions with broadline photons and ir dust emission are important when calculating the cumulative neutrino background .",
    "our study is useful to see if radio - loud agn can explain the icecube signal or not .",
    "we show that the simple inner jet model has difficulty in explaining the icecube data even when the external radiation fields are taken into account .",
    "even so , interestingly , we find that the expected neutrino signal in the @xmath15  eev range provides promising targets for future projects suitable for higher - energy neutrinos , such as the askaryan radio array ( ara )  @xcite , the antarctic ross ice - shelf antenna neutrino array ( arianna )  @xcite , the antarctic impulsive transient antenna ( anita ) ultrahigh - energy neutrino detector  @xcite , and the exavolt antenna ( eva ) mission  @xcite .    throughout this work ,",

    "we take hubble constant @xmath17 , and let the dimensionless density paramters for mass and cosmological constant be given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "in general , the observed blazar sed consists of several spectral components produced in different regions ( for reviews , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we consider four components that can be relevant as target photons for @xmath13 interactions .",
    "first , broadband nonthermal synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission originates from the dissipation region in the jet .",
    "second , there are accretion - disk photons that enter the jet directly or after being scattered by electrons in the surrounding gas and dust . provided that the jet location is @xmath20 cm and the thomson - scattering optical depth is @xmath21 ,",
    "the direct accretion - disk component can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "the third component is the broad agn atomic line radiation ; this emission component is especially relevant for pev neutrino production in qhbs .",
    "fourth , there is ir emission from the dust torus . a schematic diagram is shown in fig .  1 and the seds of blazars are shown in fig .  2 as a function of the radio luminosity at 5  ghz ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that we regard the seds as functions of @xmath22 ( see table 1 ) , and that the radio luminosity itself is irrelevant for our calculations since crs do not interact with such low - energy photons .",
    "there is uncertainty in modeling those four components but our systematic approach is reasonable for the purpose of obtaining neutrino spectra .",

    ", width=288 ]      multiwavelength radio through @xmath4-ray observations have indicated several interesting features in blazar seds , the most prominent of which is a double - humped structure .",
    "the seds of high synchrotron - peaked ( hsp )  @xcite bl lac objects and radio galaxies are usually well fit with the ssc model consisting of synchrotron and ssc components that account for the low- and high - energy humps , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the seds of lsp bl lac objects and fsrqs are generally well fit with the external inverse - compton model , which requires compton scattering components associated with external radiation fields , in addition to the synchrotron and ssc components .",
    "the synchrotron and compton peak energies decrease with increasing bolometric luminosity , and this behavior is termed the blazar sequence  @xcite .",
    "although the validity of the blazar sequence is still under debate due to possible selection biases  @xcite , the phenomenological sed - luminosity correlations provide a method to characterize the broad range of blazar seds from the least to most luminous .",
    "we define the apparent bolometric radiation luminosity of the jet , integrated over all frequencies , as @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath4-ray luminosity integrated above @xmath25  mev is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "note that only a fraction of the kinetic and magnetic - field luminosity is dissipated into radiation , and the ratio of the total radiation luminosity , @xmath24 , to the sum of proton , electron and magnetic - field luminosity is typically assumed to be @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "for an on - axis observer who measures the radiation from a spherical blob moving with the lorentz factor @xmath28 , the _ absolute _ radiation power is @xmath29 ( for details , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in the blob formulation , where the relativistic blob is spherical in its comoving frame , the comoving size of the blob is @xmath30 , assuming that the doppler factor @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the variability time in the black - hole frame , and the typical dissipation radius is estimated to be @xmath33 .",
    "then the energy density of target photons in the comoving frame is @xmath34 which is consistent with the result of the wind formulation @xmath35 except for a factor of order unity . in the wind formulation , which is usually used in the context of grbs",
    ", it is supposed that the central engine produces a relativistic outflow with isotropic - equivalent radiation luminosity @xmath24 .",
    "the comoving photon spectrum is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the comoving photon energy and @xmath38 is the comoving luminosity differential in photon energy .",
    "also , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the photon energy and luminosity in the black - hole frame .",
    "note that primes are used for quantities in the rest frame of the black hole , while unprimed quantities are defined in the observer frame or the fluid comoving frame .",
    "for example , @xmath41 is the energy in the black - hole rest frame , @xmath42 is the energy in the observer frame , and @xmath37 is the energy in the comoving frame .      in standard accretion - disk theory  @xcite , emission from the accretion disk",
    "consists of multicolor blackbody radiation and an x - ray component from hot plasma surrounding the black hole that comptonizes the uv accretion - disk radiation .",
    "the big blue bump in the uv range is attributed to this multicolor blackbody component ( consisting of contributions from different temperature regions ) , although this bump is generally not observed in the seds of bl lac objects , either because it is very weak , or hidden by the strong beamed nonthermal continuum radiation  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . when the accretion disk is radiatively inefficient , which is more plausible for low - luminosity agn , including bl lac objects , other mechanisms such as bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation are relevant .",
    "all external radiation fields , including broadline and dust components , are related to the accretion - disk luminosity . in this work ,",
    "we adopt @xmath43 using the phenomenological relationship between the bolometric radiation luminosity of the jet ( @xmath24 ) and the 2 - 10  kev x - ray disk luminosity ( @xmath44 )  @xcite .",
    "the constant of proportionality is determined by modeling the observed @xmath4-ray luminosity function through the observed x - ray disk luminosity function  @xcite .",
    "then the 2 - 10 kev x - ray disk luminosity is connected to the bolometric accretion - disk luminosity ( @xmath45 ) using the results of lusso et al .",
    "the accretion - disk seds are taken from elvis et al .",
    "we only consider energies above @xmath46  ev for the accretion - disk radiation , because the accretion disk has a hard spectrum with @xmath47 below the peak energy  @xcite , so the number of disk photons decreases with decreasing energy .",
    "consequently the ir emission from the dust torus becomes the dominant radiation field below 1  ev .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we make the assumption that the radiation field is locally isotropic .",
    "this assumption becomes poor if the dissipation radius @xmath48 is small and the radiation energy density is dominated by anisotropically distributed photons impinging from behind .",
    "provided that the emission region is located inside the blr where radiation from the accretion disk is reprocessed , but @xmath20 cm , as previously noted , this assumption gives a reasonably good approximation . in this case , the thomson scattering optical depth of the blr is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electron density in the blr  @xcite and @xmath51 is the blr radius ( see the next subsection ) . throughout this paper , we take @xmath52 , following previous work  @xcite . although @xmath53 is uncertain , as long as @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the broadline luminosity ) , our results are not sensitive to this assumption since broadline and dust torus emission is more relevant for neutrino production than scattered accretion - disk radiation .",
    "the energy density of scattered photons in the jet comoving frame is given by @xmath56 and the comoving photon spectrum by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is used instead of @xmath59 , since external photon fields are isotropic in the black - hole rest frame .",
    "broadline emission originates in numerous small , cold , and dense gas concentrations , which are photoionized by the uv and x - rays emitted from the accretion disk and hot plasma .",
    "the key point of this work is to include effects of interactions between crs and broadline radiation  @xcite .",

    "the broadline emission consists of atomic lines and continua , with the continuum radiation accounting for a small fraction of the total broadline emission . for simplicity , neglecting continua due to free - bound emission , we consider two atomic lines , namely h i and he ii ly@xmath0 emission , and we use the above relation for the h i ly@xmath0 luminosity , which is the most important line  @xcite .",
    "we also take @xmath64 for the he ii ly@xmath0 luminosity  @xcite , but even with this large line luminosity , the results are only weakly affected due to the small number of he ii ly@xmath0 photons .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one may ask whether the @xmath4 rays that accompany neutrino production violate the intensity of the diffuse @xmath4-ray background measured by _ fermi _  @xcite . as shown in murase et al .",
    "@xcite , the approximate feynman scaling of @xmath12 interactions leads to power - law secondary spectra stretching from gev energies , so the observed diffuse @xmath4-ray background gives us powerful constraints on viable @xmath12 scenarios that can explain the observed cumulative neutrino background from astrophysical sources .",
    "on the other hand , efficient photomeson production is expected only for sufficiently high - energy protons , and the hadronically - induced @xmath4 rays produced at pev energies are significantly broadened via electromagnetic cascades both inside and outside the source .",
    "therefore , contrary to @xmath12 scenarios , the diffuse @xmath4-ray flux from photohadronic interactions does not greatly exceed the total neutrino background flux of @xmath86  @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the 100 gev diffuse @xmath4-ray background of @xmath87 , and the cumulative @xmath4-ray intensity from all fsrqs resolved by _ fermi _ is even larger  @xcite .",
    "thus , only a small fraction of the extragalactic @xmath4 rays can be made by hadronic processes , which is consistent with the standard leptonic scenario of blazars , as considered here .",
    "grbs have also been extensively discussed as possible sources of pev neutrinos , starting with the seminal paper by waxman and bahcall  @xcite .",
    "prior to the completion of icecube , analytical estimates  @xcite as well as numerical studies that take into account multiple resonances , multipion production , and cooling of mesons and muons , were made both in the prompt  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and afterglow  @xcite phases . based on stacking analyses , icecube has recently put an interesting constraint on prompt neutrino emission , which is @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "but , as independently pointed out by several groups  @xcite , while the results of the earlier numerical studies  @xcite are confirmed , it is not sufficient to rule out the hypothesis that uhecrs come from grbs due to several caveats in the reference analytical model used in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental limit itself is strong enough to argue that it is difficult for classical high - luminosity grbs to explain the icecube signal  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "different classes of grbs , including low - luminosity grbs and ultralong grbs are allowed to explain the icecube signal  @xcite .",
    "a variety of classes of agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , grbs , and peculiar supernovae have been proposed as candidate accelerators of crs  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these compact cr accelerators , cr  reservoirs \" containing different types of cr sources , could also be sources of high - energy neutrinos .",
    "crs can be confined for very long times in star - forming and starburst galaxies , and in galaxy clusters and groups , so these `` cr reservoirs '' are promising neutrino and @xmath4-ray sources via @xmath12 interactions .",
    "interestingly , pre - icecube models predicted a neutrino spectral break coming from cr escape , and they can nicely explain the present icecube data within the astrophysical uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we here point out that the number of starburst galaxies with agn is comparable to that of starburst galaxies  @xcite .",
    "thus , for _ starbursts with agn _ , crs escaping from agn jets could efficiently interact with the interstellar medium , if the jets are dissipated in the galaxy or many of the crs can escape transversely from the jets .",
    "detailed studies focusing on starburst galaxies including those with agn are presented elsewhere , and pev neutrino production is shown to be possible  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath12 scenarios can be tested by observations of sub - pev neutrinos with icecube , and the sub - tev diffuse @xmath4-ray background that is produced in concert with the neutrinos , as well as tev @xmath4-ray observations of individual sources  @xcite .",
    "note that their minimum contribution to the diffuse @xmath4-ray background is expected to be @xmath89% for star - formation rate evolution .",
    "higher - energy neutrino detectors such as ara and arianna are more suitable for the purpose of detecting very high - energy @xmath5  eev neutrinos . as in the case of",
    "pev neutrino discovery , the first detections may be observed as diffuse emission , where competing possibilities must be considered for their origin .",
    "indeed , cosmogenic neutrinos give a diffuse neutrino intensity of @xmath90 , depending on redshift evolution models and the uhecr composition  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible for on - source neutrino emission from blazars to dominate over cosmogenic neutrino signals , as figs .",
    "13 and 14 show .",
    "this is the case if radio - loud agn are sources of uhecrs , and if the observed uhecrs are mainly heavy nuclei rather than protons .",
    "the cosmogenic neutrino intensity should in this case be comparable to the nucleus - survival bound  @xcite , which is much lower than the waxman - bahcall bound .",
    "an important issue is then how to discriminate among various possibilities .",
    "the inner jet model fortunately gives a strong prediction , given that the high - energy neutrino intensity , if from radio - loud agn , is made primarily by only a few dozens of bright and luminous fsrqs .",
    "so , the origin of @xmath5  eev neutrinos can also be tested by correlating directional information of the high - energy neutrinos with luminous fsrqs in the _ fermi _ catalog .",
    "besides radio - loud agn , neutrinos formed in grb afterglows can also be strong emitters of @xmath5  eev neutrinos  @xcite , assuming uhecrs can be accelerated at the external forward and reverse shocks . in this case",
    ", the diffuse neutrino intensity can be @xmath91 ( see fig .  12 in ref .",
    "this possibility can also be distinguished by stacking analyses , taking into account space and time coincidence with observed grbs .",
    "finally , newborn pulsars may be possible sources of uhecrs , where @xmath27  eev neutrinos should be detected  @xcite .",
    "since bright and luminous qhbs are important , the inner jet model can also be discriminated from such the newborn pulsar scenario .",
    "in this work , we studied high - energy neutrino production in the inner jets of radio - loud agn , including effects of external photon fields .",
    "the diffuse neutrino intensity was obtained by characterizing the blazar seds assuming the validity of the blazar sequence .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) external radiation fields can play a major role in pev - eev neutrino production , so they should not be neglected .",
    "in particular , broadline emission is crucial for pev neutrino production .",
    "the typical photomeson production efficiency in the blr is @xmath92% , independent of @xmath28 and @xmath32 , provided that the crs are well above threshold and accelerated inside the blr .",
    "photohadronic losses with ir photons from the dust torus compete with acceleration to prevent acceleration of crs to @xmath93  ev energies .",
    "therefore luminous qhbs can not be sources of uhecr protons due to severe photohadronic cooling .",
    "photodisintegration interactions with ir photons deplete heavy nuclei , so that production and escape of uhecr nucleons is most likely to happen in low - luminosity blazars , such as hsp bl lac objects  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) in the blazar - sequence model , the main contribution to the cumulative neutrino background comes from luminous qhbs ( mainly fsrqs ) rather than bl lac objects .",
    "interactions of @xmath10  pev crs with blr radiation is unavoidable in models that assume acceleration of high - energy crs in the inner jets of fsrqs . we find that the cumulative neutrino background from radio - loud agn will be dominated by dozens of blazars .",
    "the clear prediction is that , if they are the main origin of the observed diffuse neutrino intensity at @xmath7  pev energies , neutrino events should be correlated with luminous fsrqs .",
    "future correlation studies can test the possibility that radio - loud agn are the main sources of the cumulative neutrino background .",
    "\\(3 ) implications of the inner jet model for the icecube signal include the result that the neutrino spectra should have a cutoff feature around pev , or they should be quite hard at sub - pev energies . because the inner jet model has difficulty in explaining the icecube signal at sub - pev energies , a different origin of sub - pev neutrinos will be required if the inner jets of blazars explain the pev neutrino events observed by icecube .",
    "\\(4 ) thanks to ir emission from the dust torus and/or internal synchrotron emission from the jet , for power - law cr spectra , the resulting neutrino spectra are too hard above pev energies , so they are disfavored by the icecube data because of the larger neutrino - nucleon cross section at these energies .",
    "if the cr spectra are described by a power law , which is reasonable for the explanation of uhecrs , the cr spectral index should be steeper than 2.5 , or have a maximum proton energy of @xmath1  pev .",
    "\\(5 ) the diffuse neutrino intensity formed by blazars can be as high as @xmath86 with @xmath94 .",
    "given @xmath95 , the local cr energy injection rate that can explain the observed diffuse neutrino intensity should be larger than the observed uhecr energy generation rate .",
    "this implies that a simultaneous explanation of the neutrino and uhecr data is not easy in the simple model , although it might be possible by changing assumptions on parameters such as @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 as well as introducing another component for sub - pev neutrinos .",
    "low - luminosity grbs ( or transrelativistic supernovae ) have also been considered as the origin of pev neutrinos  @xcite and/or uhecrs , and the required cr loading factor in the blazar inner jet model ( e.g. , @xmath99 for @xmath100 ) is comparable to or a bit larger than the values found in these grb models .",
    "this is because , even though the @xmath4-ray energy budget of blazars is larger than that of grbs , their typical effective @xmath13 optical depth is modest , @xmath92% , for pev neutrinos .",
    "\\(6 ) whether the observed cumulative neutrino background in the pev range is explained by the agn inner jet model or not , we emphasize that eev neutrino observations are crucial to test the hypothesis that radio - loud agn are the main sources of uhecrs . indeed , for reasonable cr loading factors ( e.g. ,",
    "@xmath101 for @xmath100 or @xmath102 for @xmath103 ) , the cr energy injection rate at @xmath104  ev is compatible with the uhecr energy budget at that energy , and that detections of associated eev neutrinos are promising even in such more conservative cases . therefore , our results suggest that future higher - energy neutrino detectors such as ara and arianna should provide an _",
    "indirect _ clue to testing the intriguing agn - uhecr scenario by detecting or failing to detect @xmath5  eev neutrinos from radio - loud agn .",
    "however , the connection between uhecrs and neutrinos is likely to be nontrivial , since uhecrs mainly come from bl lac objects while neutrinos mostly come from qhbs . as in pev neutrinos ,",
    "if the cumulative neutrino background mainly comes from radio - loud agn , the expected diffuse neutrino intensity at @xmath27  eev energies should be correlated with bright and luminous _ fermi _ blazars .",
    "because of the limitations of the intensive numerical treatment , we considered only specific parameter sets for @xmath28 and @xmath32 .",
    "although the neutrino production efficiency in the blazar zone suffers from large astrophysical uncertainty as in grbs , it is less uncertain for neutrinos due to radiation fields rom the blr and dust torus . a parallel treatment using a less accurate but faster semianalytic model  @xcite , which makes a parameter study feasible , confirms the conclusions found here .",
    "finally , we note that hadronic @xmath4 rays necessarily accompany photohadronic reactions , as we already discussed .",
    "in contrast to hadronic models for blazar @xmath4-ray emission  @xcite , we assumed the leptonic model with only a weak or subdominant hadronic @xmath4-ray component .",
    "this assumption can be verified by comparing neutrino luminosity with @xmath26 in figs . 2 and 9 .",
