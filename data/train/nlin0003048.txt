    ", the experiments are performed using a 16 x 16 array of diode resonators driven in the stable period-2 regime . a bias consisting of a second drive at half the main frequency renders one phase more stable and a phase kink can be made to propagate across the array . for an intermediate value of the coupling resistors and small bias , we observe propagation failure .",
    "adding noise to the drive of each element , either from a single source or from individual sources - corresponding to global and local noise , respectively - greatly increases the chances of successful signal transmission .",

    "[ velocity ] compares the velocities of the propagating wavefront as a function of the noise strength for both global and local noise .",
    "the velocity of the propagating wavefront shows an approximate linear increase with increasing noise strength in both cases .",
    "note that the velocity is simply the inverse of the measured arrival times -multiplied by number of sites .",
    "it is hence well - defined only for low noise levels ; in the case of substantial nucleation of additional thermal kinks - antikink pairs this calculated `` velocity '' should be interpreted with caution .",
    "therefore , the data points in figs . [ velocity ] and [ numvelocity ] which correspond to significant noise corruption should be considered as outliers .",
    "for the coupling resistors used the velocity for the global noise case is about 15 % greater than that seen for local noise .    besides the earlier onset in the case of global noise , there are also notable differences in the mechanism that leads to spurious signals .",
    "clearly , for identical elements - unlike spatially uncorrelated noise - global noise can not induce spurious kinks , which then compete with the deterministic kink due to the signal . the only way of generating a `` false alarm '' at the detector would be to phase flip the entire chain , thus requiring a single large fluctuation .",
    "this picture is not fully correct if there are mismatches between the elements but illustrates the dominant mechanism of creating the signal - masking noise background .",
    "independent noise sources , however , easily spawn spurious kinks but rarely ever cause a global phase flip of the array .",
    "we postulate that the mechanism of noise sustained propagation _",
    "per se _ is not very different for local and global noise , presumed the kink width is small ( i.e. involving a few elements only ) .",
    "the reason for this conjecture is the local nature of the stochastic escape processes that provide for the average effective kink displacement .",
    "as long as the spatial correlation length of the noise is not substantially smaller than the kink width , the noise induced `` propulsion '' of the kink will be similar for global and local noise .",

    "_ @xcite who briefly addressed the issue of noise correlation lengths , are consistent with this conjecture .",

    "gap junctions , characterized by the ( relatively high ) intercellular resistance @xmath3 , provide the electrical coupling between cardiac cells . mathematically , the propagation of action potential along cardiac cells is described by various cable theories , which are analogous to wave propagation in one - dimensional conductors ( cables ) .",
    "formally , continuous and discrete models describe the wave propagation by either a partial differential equation or - in the latter case - via coupled ordinary differential equations . _ continuous cable theory _ either ignores the effects of the gap junctions or replaces the cytoplasmic resistance with an effective resistance ; in either case the electrical resistance is assumed to be spatially homogeneous . here , we focus on the opposite assumption that gap junctional resistance is much more important than cytoplasmic resistance .",
    "we thus neglect the dynamics within a cell and assume that the propagation of the action potential is dominated by the delay caused by the gap junctions @xcite . within the context of this _ discrete cable theory _ , we can write the current balance as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the transmembrane potential for the @xmath6th cell , @xmath7 the surface area of cell membrane , and @xmath8 is the membrane capacitance per unit area of membrane .",
