    "the possible correlation observed between the mass of the bh and that of the host spheroid ( either the bulge of a spiral galaxy , or the entire mass of an elliptical galaxy ) has prompted serious studies of the relationship between bh growth and host galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "the nuclei of many agns and normal galaxies alike are heavily obscured by dust , making it difficult to study kinematics at visible wavelengths .",
    "for example , the 3cr hst snapshot survey has shown that the nuclei of radio galaxies are often covered by foreground dust lanes @xcite .",
    "this has been further confirmed by other sensitive surveys with wfpc2 and nicmos @xcite .",
    "such dust obscuration can distort both absorption line and emission line velocity field measurements to such an extent that reliable bh mass estimates are difficult or impossible using optical data alone .",
    "ir spectroscopy is thus increasingly important to continue to find and measure the masses of black holes in active galaxies .",
    "centaurus a ( ngc5128 ) , the closest active giant elliptical galaxy , nicely illustrates the problem of dust obscuration . at optical wavelengths , its nucleus is made almost completely invisible by its dust lane , rich in molecular and ionized gas , which obscures the inner half kiloparsec of the galaxy .",
    "a comprehensive recent review on the properties of the galaxy and of its agn is presented by @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the ionized gas was mapped in @xmath12  by @xcite and subsequently modeled by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter nbt92 ) who showed that the dust lane can be kinematically and morphologically explained with a thin warped disk geometry . on the assumption of closed circular orbits ,",

    "near infrared observations were performed in may , june and july 1999 , with isaac mounted at the _ antu _ unit ( ut1 ) of the vlt telescope .",
    "isaac @xcite is a near - ir imager and spectrograph equipped with a 1024x1024 rockwell detector whose pixels subtend 0147 on the sky .",

    "the dispersion was 0.6  / pix and 1.2  / pix respectively , yielding a resolving power of 10000 in j and 9000 in k.    seeing during observations ( performed in service mode ) was in the range @xmath22 , with photometric conditions . at a given position angle of the slit ,",
    "the observation procedure was to obtain an acquisition image in k and then center the slit on the prominent nuclear peak ( paper i ) . for off nuclear positions a small telescope movement ( @xmath23 perpendicular to the slit ) was subsequently performed . after positioning the slit , observations consisted of several pairs of exposures in which the object was moved to two different positions along the slit ( which we call a and b ) , in order to perform sky subtraction .",
    "this led to an effective slit length of 45 .",
    "the on - chip integration time was 180s resulting in a total on - source integration time of 36 m at each slit position .",
    "the slit positions are summarized in fig .",

    "[ tab : log ] .",
    "the orientation of the nuc-1 slit was chosen to align with the major axis of the @xmath5  disk . to give a clearer picture of any kinematical signature of the molecular bar , the nuc-2 slit was oriented along the bar major axis .",
    "data reduction was standard for near - ir spectroscopy and performed using iraf . in each a or b frame , we first removed the electronic ghost using task _ is_ghost _ in the eso eclipse package @xcite .",
    "the frames were then flat fielded with differential spectroscopic dome exposures and sky subtraction was performed for each couple of frames ( a - b ) .",
    "corrections for geometrical distortion of the slit direction and wavelength calibration were performed using oh sky line present on the detector @xcite .",
    "we verified that the rectification was performed to better than 0.10.2pix on the detector parts where the object is located ( @xmath24pix along the slit ) .",
    "the relative accuracy of wavelength calibration was better than 0.2  in k and j. after the 2 dimensional rectification procedure , we obtained two single spectra from each a - b frame and removed residual sky emission by fitting and subtracting a linear polynomium along the slit .",
    "correction for the instrumental response and telluric absorption were performed by using the o6/o7 star hd113754 , observed each night at the beginning and at the end of the observations .",
    "the intrinsic spectral shape of the standard star was removed by multiplying by @xmath25 which is typical of o5 - 9 stars in the near - ir .    the final 2d spectrum at each slit position",
    "was then obtained by averaging together all single frames .",
    "first , the frames were aligned along the slit via cross - correlation and shifts along the dispersion direction ( due to grating movements between different instrument setups ) where corrected using the oh sky lines present in each frame . with this correction the zero point of the wavelength scale has an accuracy of 0.4  corresponding to a velocity error of 10@xmath26@xmath27  in j and 6@xmath26@xmath27  in k. all frames were then shifted to a common center and coadded rejecting bad pixels / cosmic rays .",
    "we then selected the spectral regions containing the lines of interest and subtracted the continuum by a polynomial / spline fit pixel by pixel along the dispersion direction . the continuum subtracted lines were fitted , row by row , along the dispersion direction with gaussian or lorentzian functions using the task longslit in the twodspec figaro package @xcite .",
    "when the snr was insufficient ( faint line ) the fitting was improved by co - adding two or more pixels along the slit direction .",
    "all velocities where then corrected for heliocentric motion .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in the next section .",
    "before analyzing the results of the observations , we discuss the accuracy of the target acquisition within the slit and the stability of the slit position during integration on source .",
    "the target acquisition strategy consisted in centering the slit on the k band nuclear peak identified on the acquisition image .",
    "given the strength of the k peak compared to the rest of the galaxy ( cf .",
    "paper i ) , the nucleus can be located accurately to better than a small fraction of the slit size ( @xmath28 given the seeing of the observations ) .",
    "a possible concern arises from observing in j following acquisition in k , if differential atmospheric refraction between j and k can move the nucleus out of the slit .",
    "we calculate , however , that in all cases differential atmospheric refraction can move the object less than 005   perpendicular to the slit , and thus this effect is negligible .",
    "the accuracy of the slit positioning is checked by comparing the rotation curves obtained at the same slit position in independent observations  the observations in j at nuc-1 and in k at off-2 were repeated .",
    "the comparison in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracy ] for @xmath1  and @xmath2 $ ]  at nuc-1 and @xmath4  at off-2 .",
    "the filled squares are the repeated observations , with better seeing .",
    "it can be seen that the rotation curves are in agreement within the errors .",
    "also , as expected , those obtained with worse seeing are smoother .",
    "the agreement shows that the procedure for target acquisition is quite accurate and that the offsets between repeated observations are much smaller than the slit size .    by comparing the 2d line maps obtained from single a / b frames",
    ", we also verified that any movement of the slit during observations does not significantly affect the rotation curves . in fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracy2 ] , we show the rotation curves obtained from @xmath4  at nuc-1 from each a / b frame .",
    "this particular set of data represents the worst case : the continuum - subtracted position - velocity maps show the largest differences , indicating the greatest amount of slit movement during the observations . allowing for lower signal - to - noise ratio with respect to the averaged map ,",
    "all the a / b frames produce rotation curves which agree within the errors .",
    "the slit movements were not large enough to significantly affect the rotation curves , i.e. they were much smaller than the spatial resolution of the observations ( 05 ) .",

    "the ionized gas rotation curves can be decomposed into two distinct velocity systems .",

    "the second velocity system is confined within the central @xmath61 and is characterized by large velocity amplitudes and gradients , fwhms which rise sharply close to @xmath62 and peak at @xmath63 , and by a flux much larger than that of the extended region .",
    "we refer to this as the _ nuclear _ component .",
    "these components can be traced also in the molecular gas but , in addition , a further extended kinematical component is seen in @xmath4  at nuc-2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2rot ] and [ fig : greyvel ] ; this component is not present in the ionized gas .      the velocity field of the extended component of the ionized gas ( cf .",
    "at all three slit positions of the @xmath1  data ) has small gradients and a quite regular structure which can be followed out to @xmath64 from the nucleus .",
    "our data can be compared with the analysis by nbt92 performed using optical lines .",
    "their data , covering most of the dust lane , are well accounted for by a model in which the gas is distributed in an optically thin warped disk . using the full two dimensional information , nbt92 determined the kinematic line of nodes for this ionized gas disk which is found to bend , following the warping of the dust lane . in the inner 15",
    "( the region covered by our data ) the kinematic line of nodes has a pa @xmath65 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the velocity gradient in our data increases from pa @xmath66 to pa @xmath67 , reaching a maximum value of 4@xmath26@xmath27/arcsec at pa @xmath68 .",
    "this value agrees well with the @xmath69/arcsec that we derive from fig .",
    "7 of nbt92 . at the distance of cen",
    "a ( 3.5mpc ) , it corresponds to 235 @xmath26@xmath27@xmath15@xmath27 . note that , nbt92 did not find high velocity gas or line widths larger than 40@xmath26@xmath27  at the nucleus of cen a. this is very likely due to reddening within the inner 2 where any nuclear @xmath12+@xmath70 $ ]  emission can be completely hidden ( @xmath71mag , see paper ii ) .",
    "the kinematics of the extended gas component can also be studied from the molecular gas as traced by the @xmath4  line . while at nuc-1 the @xmath1  and @xmath4  velocity curves are very similar , at nuc-2 , the @xmath4  velocity shows a sharp linear rise between @xmath72 , with a peak to peak amplitude of @xmath73 at @xmath74 , and then a smooth decrease out to @xmath75 where the velocity drops to its systemic value .",
    "it traces the kinematics of the molecular gas alone , as it is not observed in @xmath1  and @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this velocity structure is symmetric with respect to the zero point ( i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath62 ) and is suggestive of the rotation curve of a ring , with an inner `` solid body rotation '' and an outer keplerian decrease .",
    "the origin of this kinematical feature will be discussed in section 5.3 .      at the positions",
    "nuc-1 and 2 , the ionized gas shows a well defined _",
    "s_-shaped velocity curve with peak to peak amplitudes up to @xmath77 .",
    "velocities from different lines in the inner 2  are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "the @xmath1 , @xmath2$]and @xmath3  data agree remarkably well at all slit positions . there is a region of small discrepancy at 05 seen in the nuc-2 spectrum probably caused by contamination from the extended component as discussed below .",
    "the @xmath3  equivalent width drops dramatically within the central 05 due to the strong nuclear continuum making velocity measurements impossible with the present data .",
    "these velocity curves are strongly suggestive of gas rotation within a thin disk .",
    "this interpretation is supported by comparing the velocity curves at position angles 33and -45  with that at pa 84 .",
    "the latter has a very small amplitude as expected if that position angle for the slit is almost perpendicular to the line of nodes of the disk which , therefore , should be oriented close to north - south . at all positions , we find a sharp increase in fwhm near the nucleus , the expected consequence of unresolved rotation close to the nucleus : it is not possible to trace the rotation curve within a spatial resolution element from the nucleus , and the mixing of high velocity components broadens the line profile .",
    "we will return to this in sec .",
    "the @xmath4  rotation curves in the inner 2  are also compared with those of the ionized gas in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath4  rotation curve , particularly at nuc-1 , is smaller than those of @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ]  and @xmath3 .",
    "note , however , the double @xmath4  line profiles between @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h2double ] ) .",
    "when accurate deblending is possible , the blueshifted velocity component agrees with the velocities measured from the ionized gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) . in the adjacent points , where deblending is impossible , the width of the lines is larger ( @xmath79 ) and the measured velocity is an intensity weighted average of the two components .",
    "the `` contamination '' from the extended component is particularly evident for @xmath80 , i.e. south of the nucleus ( cf .",
    "[ fig : slitpos ] ) , at nuc-1 and off-2 .",
    "it is also responsible for the sharp decrease in @xmath4  velocity observed at off-1 below @xmath81 .",
    "the discrepant @xmath2 $ ]  velocities at nuc-2 are also likely caused by mixing of these 2 velocity components and the increased @xmath2 $ ]  line widths at this location support this interpretation .",
    "the high velocity components are thus present also in the molecular lines but they are partly hidden by the superposition with the extended component . however , when deblending is possible , velocities from the rotating disk can still be measured and they are in agreement with those from the ionized gas .",
    "this `` contamination '' is likely to be present also in the other lines but their extended components are much weaker with respect to the nuclear ones ( see the line fluxes along the slit in the figures ) and do not affect the velocity determination in the inner 2 .",
    "the nuclear velocity curves described in the previous section clearly suggest gas rotating in a disk around a compact mass .",
    "we now investigate if they are indeed quantitatively consistent with this interpretation . under the hypothesis of a thin gaseous disk circularly rotating in the gravitational potential of a point mass @xmath82",
    ", the rotation curve at a given slit position can be written as @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the deprojected radial distance , @xmath85 is the distance from the disk minor axis and @xmath86 is the disk inclination with respect to the line of sight ( @xmath87 is the face - on case ) .",
    "the geometry and definitions are also summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : diskgeo ] and in the appendix .",
    "this formula provides the velocity along a thin slit but is not immediately applicable since the finite spatial resolution of the observations smears the velocity cusps of the rotation curve .",
    "moreover , the measured velocities are intensity weighted averages over apertures determined by the slit size and the number of pixels integrated along the slit . to simulate the effects of seeing , we convolve with a gaussian psf ( _ point spread function _ ) with fwhm equal to the seeing of the observations ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we then integrate over the slit size to derive the expected velocity @xmath89 as a function of the slit coordinate @xmath55 .",
    "the observations provide us with several datasets , each from a given line ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] @xmath4  or @xmath3 ) at a given slit position ( nuc-1 , nuc-2 , nuc-3 , off-1 and off-2 ) .",
    "each data set @xmath90 comprises @xmath91 points and each point is characterized by its position along the slit @xmath92 ( in pixels , i.e. detector coordinates ) and its velocity @xmath93 ( in @xmath26@xmath27 ) derived from the line fitting procedure .",
    "three free parameters are associated with each dataset :    * @xmath94 , the pixel at which @xmath62 ; * @xmath95@xmath96 , the distance of the center of the slit from the nucleus ; * @xmath97@xmath96 , the angle between the slit and the line of nodes of the disk ;    @xmath94  is fixed at the position of the continuum peak . in the k band ,",
    "the continuum peak undoubtedly identifies the location of the nucleus , given its strength relative to the surrounding emission from the galaxy . in the j band",
    ", however , the continuum peak has an intensity comparable with that of the extended emission : any asymmetry in the galaxy emission ( due , e.g. , to an extinction gradient ) could shift the peak of the continuum with respect to the position of the nucleus .",
    "therefore @xmath98@xmath96 must be allowed to vary with respect to the position of the flux peak by the same amount for lines from the same spectrum . once @xmath94  and the pixel size are set ,",
    "the coordinate @xmath55 along the slit is given by @xmath99 .",
    "for the nuclear positions nuc-1,2 and 3 , @xmath95@xmath96 is set to 0 , given that the acquisition procedure and the telescope guiding accuracy is well below 01 .",
    "for the off - nuclear position , @xmath95@xmath100 .",
    "since the relative orientation of each pair of slit positions is fixed by the observational strategy , all values of @xmath101 are determined by a single value @xmath97 , the angle between the line of nodes and the north - south direction .",
    "the `` global '' free parameters are :    * @xmath86 , the inclination of the disk ; * @xmath102 , the black hole mass ; * @xmath103 , the systemic velocity .",
    "we fit the free parameters by minimizing @xmath104 : @xmath105 where n is the total number of datasets and @xmath106 is the number of free parameters .    since ,",
    "as shown in the previous section , the @xmath4  rotation curves of the nuclear component are contaminated by the extended component , and the signal - to - noise and spatial sampling of the @xmath3  data is poorer than that of @xmath2 $ ]  and @xmath1 , we fit only the latter two lines .",

    "the agreement between the data and the models is good for all three slit positions at disk inclinations below 60 .",
    "the residuals do not show any systematic trend and their rms is typically @xmath107 @xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "although the best fit models trace the data well , the minimum @xmath108  values are far larger than expected for a good fit .",
    "this discrepancy probably arises from the fitted data points not being statistically independent . from a visual inspection of the fits",
    ", we estimate typical uncertainties on fit parameters as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "we assess the validity of our results by comparing the model rotation curves with the observed @xmath4  and @xmath3  curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fith2bg ] ) .",
    "in particular , the asymmetric behaviour of the off - nuclear rotation curves measured from the @xmath4  and @xmath3  lines , typical of the impact parameter being not zero , is naturally accounted for .",
    "we examined the effects of varying the disk inclination on the determination of the value of the central mass ; these two parameters are strongly coupled , since the amplitude of the rotation curve is proportional to @xmath112 . a weaker dependence on @xmath86alone is also present , as the deprojected radius @xmath84 depends on @xmath113 ( see the appendix ) .",
