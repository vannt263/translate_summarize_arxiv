    "opinions about the true _ quantum _ character of such games are divided , however .",
    "it has been argued that quantized games are nothing but disguised classical games @xcite . in other words , to _ quantize _ a game is claimed equivalent to replacing the original game by a _",
    "different _ classical game .    in the present paper ,",
    "we associate a quantum game with a classical game in a way which addresses this criticism by imposing two constraints :    1 .",
    "the players choose their moves ( or actions ) from the _ same _ set in both the classical and the quantized game .",
    "2 .   the players agree on explicit expressions for their payoffs which must _ not _ be modified when switching between the classical and the quantized version of the game .",
    "games with these properties are expected to be immune against the criticism raised above . in the new setting ,",
    "the only ` parameter ' is the _ input state _ on which the players act , and its nature will determine the classical or quantum character of the game .",
    "our approach to quantum games , tailored to satisfy both ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) , is inspired by bell s work @xcite : _ correlations _ of measurement outcomes are essential .",
    "effectively , we will define payoff relations in terms of correlations - these payoffs will become sensitive to the classical or quantum nature of the input allowing for modified nash equilibria .",
