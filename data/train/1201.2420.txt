    "b[e ] stars are intermediate - mass stars associated with substantial amounts of circumstellar gas and dust , as indicated by permitted and forbidden line emission , in particular of [ ] and [ ] , and a strong infrared excess @xcite .",
    "these class - defining characteristics have been observed in a wide range of evolutionary stages @xcite , including pre - main - sequence stars ( herbig  ae / b[e ] ) , post - main - sequence stars ( supergiants , symbiotic stars , or compact planetary nebulae ) , and stars of unknown nature ( unclassified b[e ] stars ) . in the pre - main - sequence stage , about half of all intermediate - mass young stars show the _ b[e ] phenomenon _ @xcite , although significant differences in the strength of the forbidden line emission can be observed .",
    "it has been proposed that the b[e ] phenomenon might be related to the presence of a close binary system , where the line - emitting gas is ejected in recurring mass - loss events triggered by the companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to search for close companions around b[e ] stars . given the kiloparsec distance of b[e ] stars , this task requires high angular resolution , which we achieve in this letter using infrared interferometry .",
    "we observed the unclassified b[e ] star v921sco using the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) .",

    "our observations on v921sco were carried out using the amber instrument @xcite , which allowed us to coherently combine the light from three of the vlti 1.8 m auxiliary telescopes .",
    "the observations were conducted using amber s low spectral resolution mode , which covers the near - infrared @xmath9- and @xmath10-bands ( @xmath11 to 2.50  @xmath1 m ) with a spectral resolution @xmath12 .",
    "the observations were carried out between 2008 - 04 - 03 and 2009 - 03 - 19 on four different array configurations ( tab .",
    "[ tab : obslog ] ) , providing a good @xmath13-coverage with baseline lengths between 10 and 127 m .",
    "for all observations , we used a detector integration time ( dit ) of 100ms .    for a significant fraction of our data",
    "we find that the closure phases ( cps ) vary significantly between subsequent exposures ( i.e.  on time scales of several minutes ) . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : continuum ] , these rapid variations are very likely due to the presence of a companion star . therefore , in contrast to the standard amber data reduction procedure , we decided not to average the individual exposures , but to fit the quantities derived from the individual data exposures separately .",
    "each observation on v921sco was accompanied by observations on interferometric calibrator stars of known intrinsic diameter , allowing us to monitor the instrumental and atmospheric transfer function .",
    "both for the science and calibrator star observations , we extract raw visibilities and cps using the amdlib ( v3.0 ) data reduction software @xcite . in order to associate the cp sign with the on - sky orientation , we use a reference data set on the binary star @xmath14orionis  c @xcite .",

    "it is also evident , that the contributions of v921sco  b to the total flux decrease with wavelength .      in order to better characterize the geometry and physical conditions of the disk - like structure in our image and to derive the relative astrometry of v921sco  a - b",
    ", we fitted geometric models to our interferometric data .    in all models ,",
    "the primary star is included as a point source , where the photospheric emission at a given wavelength is given by the flux ratio of a b0 ( @xmath42  k , @xmath43 ) kurucz model atmosphere @xcite to the measured total sed flux @xmath44 , with contributions @xmath45 ranging from 0.27 ( at 1.5  @xmath1 m ) , 0.13 ( at 2.0  @xmath1 m ) to 0.07 ( at 2.5  @xmath1 m ) , where @xmath46 denotes the photospheric flux contribution of the primary star .",
    "we adopt @xmath47 , a stellar radius of @xmath48 , and a distance of @xmath49  pc @xcite .",
    "given that the spectral type of the primary was determined in earlier studies without knowledge of the companion star , we note that these spectral type estimates are potentially biased , which could affect the photospheric flux of the primary star in our models . however , the absolute level and wavelength - dependence of the photospheric emission in the near - infrared wavelength regime depends only weakly on the precise spectral type and will therefore not significantly affect our modeling results .",
    "the companion star is described by five free parameters , namely the pa ( @xmath50 ) and separation ( @xmath51 ) measured from the primary star , the angular extent of the circumstellar material ( parameterized as gaussians with fwhm @xmath52 ) , and two parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) to describe the photospheric flux contributions of v921sco  b to the total flux .",
    "the flux contributions might change with wavelength due to differences in the stellar effective temperatures , local extinction effects , or circumstellar emission .",
    "given the still relatively short wavelength coverage , we approximate these effects with the linear relation @xmath55 , where we choose @xmath56 m as arbitrary reference wavelength .",
    "free parameters of the circumprimary disk are the pa ( @xmath57 ) , angular extend along the major axis ( gaussian fwhm @xmath58 ) , and inclination angle ( @xmath59 , measured from the polar axis ) . due to temperature gradients in the circumstellar material , it is possible that the source brightness distribution might change with wavelength . to test this hypothesis , we performed our geometric fits both to the complete data set and to the aforementioned data subsets ( @xmath9 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 wavelength bins ) .    in order to find the best fit ,",
    "we employ a levenberg - marquardt least square fitting procedure and minimize the likelihood - estimator @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the reduced least square between the measured and model visibilities and cps , respectively ( eqs .  1 and 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "for our best - fit solution ( tab .",

    "our imacs narrowband and broadband images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imacs ] ) reveal a remarkably complex environment around v921sco .",
    "the overall shape of the nebula is bipolar , where the south - western part appears much fainter and less extended , maybe indicating that this part is facing away from the observer and therefore suffers from a larger amount of obscuration from material in the ambient cloud .",
    "obscuration from fore - ground material might also be responsible for the dark filaments which appear in the south - eastern part of the nebula ( shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : imacs]_g _ ) .    remarkably , the symmetry axis of the bipolar nebula ( @xmath92 ) appears well aligned with the polar axis ( @xmath93 ) of the au - scale disk detected with interferometry , suggesting that the nebula might have been shaped through outflow - activity from v921sco . from our kinematical modeling ( kraus et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", we conclude that the disk is notably inclined , with the north - eastern disk axis facing towards earth .",
    "therefore , based on the measured disk inclination and orientation , one would expect the north - eastern lobe of the bipolar nebula to appear brighter , as is observed .",
    "this scenario provides a natural explanation for the large number of arc- and cone - shaped structures which can be seen in our imacs images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imacs ] ) and that appear centered on v921sco .",
    "we have identified the most significant of these arc- and cone - shaped features in our deepest image ( @xmath94-band , fig .",

    "[ fig : imacs]_g_.    the distribution of the individual arc - fragments , in particular in the north - eastern lobe , suggests that we might observe up to five layers of ejecta , which have been created during episodic events of extreme mass - loss . in order to obtain a rough estimate for the period of the mass - loss events , we measured the typical separation between the different layers ( 4 - 5 ) and apply a projection factor in order to correct for the system inclination angle of @xmath95 ( sect .",

    "increasing the number density in the cluster , our observations strengthen the argument that v921sco is likely in a young evolutionary stage and , as many massive ysos , embedded in a star forming region of low- and intermediate - mass ysos .",
    "our detection of a companion around v921sco is interesting in the context of earlier suggestions that the b[e ] phenomenon might be related to dynamical interaction in a close binary system , either as result of a recent stellar merger ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or through material which might have been ejected during phases of binary interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , only very few b[e]-stars have been studied so far with sufficient angular resolution to make definite statements about multiplicity .",

    "both the projected separation ( @xmath97  au ) and orbital period ( @xmath97  yrs ) of this system shows similarities with the characteristics which we deduce for v921sco ( @xmath98  au , @xmath87  yrs ) .",
    "also , both systems are embedded in an extended nebulosity with shell - like sub - structure , indicating episodic mass - loss .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the mass - loss in both systems might be triggered by dynamical interaction of the companions with the circumprimary disks .",
    "the b[e]-star - characteristic permitted and forbidden line emission might then originate in low density material which is periodically stripped away from the circumprimary disk .",
    "this scenario works independently of the evolutionary status and physics of the circumprimary disks ( accretion or excretion disks ) and might explain the diversity of stellar systems ( herbig b[e ] , supergiant , symbiotic star , compact planetary nebulae ) , in which the b[e ] phenomenon is observed",
    ".    follow - up interferometric studies on v921sco and hd87643 might confirm this scenario for instance by measuring the orbital eccentricity and by imaging the expected star - disk interaction effects during periastron passage .",
