    "in the diverse family of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , blazars stand out due to their extreme variability in all wavebands and over a broad range of timescales .",
    "their predominantly non - thermal emission arises in relativistic jets that are pointed close to our line of sight .",
    "the resulting doppler boosting is responsible for their short - timescale variability , apart from boosting their flux and creating the illusion of superluminal motion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this broadband variability presents both a challenge and an opportunity . on the one hand ,",
    "the variability makes it difficult to construct a physical model of high - energy emission from blazars . on the other hand ,",
    "the variability also provides important constraints on the many open questions about the origin of blazar emission . with continuous monitoring of the sky by the _",

    "blazars are typically divided into bllac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) with the formal distinction being the absence or presence , respectively , of emission lines with a rest frame equivalent width @xmath12    ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "past x - ray observation by rosat ( e.g. , @xcite ) shows a flatter energy distribution than typical for a radio - selected bllac leading to the suggestion that s4  0954 + 65  may be a transition object with properties that lie in between the bllac and fsrq classes .",
    "this idea has also been explored by @xcite , who , however , conclude that it should be classified as a lbl ( a  low - peaked \" bllac object ) based on the luminosity of the broad - line region in eddington units , rather than the emission lines equivalent width .",

    "here we define the jet power components as in @xcite ; @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , where @xmath71 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting blob , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the energy densities of magnetic field and electrons , respectively , and @xmath74 is the volume of the emitting blob . note that this definition assumes a two - sided jet .",
    "this poynting - flux dominance is robust under our ec assumption and not unprecedented considering there are several blazars showing a similar feature of @xmath75 such as 0234 + 285 and 0528 + 134 ( see table  a2 of @xcite ) .",
    "there is some evidence that cold protons in the jet ( @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a proton distribution and @xmath78 is assumed , see e.g. , @xcite ) can carry much larger ( as large as 100 times ) power than the emitting electrons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is possible in the context of the models presented here , that @xmath79 .",
    "this paper serves as a case study for the capability of detecting new vhe sources based upon follow - up of flaring lat sources showing spectral hardening ( i.e. fluxes above @xmath80 photons @xmath9 s@xmath10 above 100  mev and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the capabilities of the lat ( specifically the daily all - sky monitoring and the improved high - energy performance from pass  8 @xcite ) are well suited to these types of efforts and we can expect many such discoveries in the next few years .",
    "in fact , several spectral hardening events have been seen from fermi - lat fsrqs ( e.g. , @xcite ) which would have been excellent candidates for vhe follow - up at the time .",
    "additionally , recent theoretical and observational studies of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) indicate that the horizon of 100 gev photons is @xmath81 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the current capabilities of the lat are allowing us to probe beyond this edge .",
    "for example , @xcite report the detection of two vhe photons from the @xmath82 blazar pks  0426 - 380 ( see also figure  13 of @xcite for the _ fermi_-lat  detection of @xmath83  gev photons from blazars beyond the horizon ) .",

    "the _ fermi_-lat  when they are in high- and hard - flux states is a way to push the redshift limit of vhe detections further and allow us to learn more about the ebl .",
