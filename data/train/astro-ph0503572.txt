    "in contrast , the values of the photon indices from the two observations are consistent within their 2@xmath75 uncertainties , so the intrinsic spectrum appears to change very little .",
    "likewise , after accounting for the interstellar and partial - covering absorption , the inferred luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031 , changes by only 10% between 2004 july and august .    finally , in order to determine the quiescent luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031 , we extracted the counts from the _ chandra _  observations during 19992003 , and during february 2005 . during 19992003 ,",

    "the ellipse is somewhat larger than the extent of the most obvious brightening of the diffuse flux because we wanted to include photons in the wings of the _ chandra _   psf , which extends a factor of @xmath274 beyond its 05 core .",
    "we judged the significances of the changes in flux by assuming that the numbers of counts follow a poisson distribution .",

    "the count rate in 2004 august , @xmath84 count s@xmath2 , was consistent with that in 2004 july , and 3@xmath75 larger than during 19992003 .",
    "finally , in 2005 february , the flux appeared to return to its value in 19992003 , with a count rate of @xmath85 count s@xmath2 .",
    "next , we attempted to determine what physical changes occurred when the region brightened .",
    "we extracted the spectra of the diffuse emission within the elliptical region from each observation prior to 2005 , obtained the appropriate instrument response files @xcite , and computed an effective area functions weighted by the number of counts in each pixel .",
    "we then computed the summed spectra and count - weighted average responses for two intervals , 1999 september through 2003 june , and 2004 july through august .",
    "for the background subtraction , we used the spectrum of the diffuse emission extracted from the `` close '' region 4  south of  in @xcite .",
    "the background contributed @xmath86% to the total spectrum .",
    "we grouped the spectra to have a minimum of 40 counts per bin between 0.5 and 8 kev .",
    "the spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "we modeled the spectra as a thermal plasma @xcite absorbed by interstellar gas and dust .",
    "the free parameters of the model were the absorption @xmath33 , temperature @xmath87 , and normalization ( proportional to the emission measure @xmath88 ) .",
    "we found that the differences in the two spectra were consistent with changes in either @xmath87 or @xmath89 .",

    "the brighter , eastern lobe is coincident with prominent dust emission in figure  [ fig : midir ] .",
    "the same appears to be true for the ionized gas in figure  [ fig : paalpha ] , although the prominence of the stars in the 1.87 @xmath98 m image makes this much less obvious .",
    "as stated in @xcite , our x - ray and infrared observations of cxogc  j174540.0290031  suggest that it is a lmxb that is viewed nearly edge - on . now that we have described the x - ray and infrared observations in greater detail , it is worth discussing how this conclusion was reached .",
    "first , the partial - covering absorption in the spectrum and the 7.9  h modulation in the light curve suggests that we observe cxogc  j174540.0290031  nearly edge - on ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the geometric arrangement that leads to the partial - covering absorption is as follows .",
    "most of the x - ray emission originates in a region a few tens of kilometers across , consisting of the inner accretion disk and , for neutron star systems , a boundary layer where the accretion flow is halted .",
    "the total radius of the accretion disk is @xmath7 km , and , at a minimum ( i.e. , ignoring radiation - induced warping , etc . )",
    ", the thickness of the accretion disk should increase as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , the outer accretion disk has @xmath101 km , and is easily thick enough to obscure the main x - ray emitting region for a system with an inclination @xmath10275@xmath103 .",
    "a fraction of the x - ray emission also originates in a corona of hot plasma above the accretion disk .",
    "the scale height of this emission is large enough that part of it is visible even from systems observed nearly edge - on , as is thought to be the case for several lmxbs that are referred to as accretion disk corona sources @xcite . the partial - covering absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : spectra ] ) . could be produced because the upper layers of the outer accretion disk are not quite optically thick to electron scattering ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "dips , similar to those seen in figure  [ fig : lc ] , are caused by discrete structures that rise above the outer accretion disk and obscure the x - ray emission for a small fraction of the binary orbit .",
    "such structures form , for example , at the point where the material lost by the companion star first impacts the accretion disk . since most of the absorption results from the incident x - rays photoionizing the intervening material",
    ", the dips should be most prominent at low - energies .",
    "this is the case in about half of all edge - on lmxbs @xcite .",
    "however , in the other half the depths of the dips are indepedent of energy @xcite , as in figure  [ fig : prof ] .",
    "this is probably because either ( 1 ) the dips result from energy - independent electron scattering by highly - ionized or metal - deficient material , or ( 2 ) the mean energy of the x - rays emitted from the corona decreases as a function of height , so that much of the cooler flux remains unobscured during the dips .",
    "should the evidence that we find for softening during the dips in figure  [ fig : prof ] be confirmed , some combination of these options can be constructed to reproduce the spectral evolution of the dip .",
    "the fact that cxogc  j174540.0290031  is a compact object accreting from a low - mass companion is indicated by the 7.9 h orbital period of the binary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) , and by the faintness of the infrared companion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irzoom ] ) . the short orbital period can accommodate a mass donor with a radius of @xmath105  @xmath106 ( frank , king , & raine 1995 , eq . 4.10 ) .",
    "the only high - mass stars that are this compact are in the wolf - rayet phase . for @xmath107 kpc and @xmath108 ( reid  1999 ; tan & draine 2003 ) a wolf - rayet star would have @xmath109 , and would have been easily detectable in our keck images .",
    "in contrast , if the few lmxbs that have been monitored in the infrared during their outbursts were placed at the galactic center , they would have had peak intensities of @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the fainter lmxbs would have been barely detectable in our 2003 keck images .",
    "therefore , the short orbital period and the lack of a counterpart with @xmath111 in figure  [ fig : irzoom ] indicates that the mass donor in cxogc  j174540.0290031  is a low - mass star that over - fills its roche lobe .",
    "the nature of the compact object is not yet clear .",
    "we did not observe either thermonuclear bursts from the surface of the compact object , or coherent pulsations that can be naturally associated with a spin period .",
    "either of these would indicate that the source is a neutron star .",
    "however , the lack of theses signals is not surprising , because the recurrence times of bursts are often longer than 100  ks and the time resolution of the acis data was too coarse to detect pulsations faster than 10  s. on the other hand , bright radio emission is much more common from black hole lmxbs than neutron star ones @xcite , which suggests that the primary in cxogc  j174540.0290031  could be a black hole .",
    "one unusual aspect of the outburst from cxogc  j174540.0290031  is that it is quite faint .",
    "the history of its x - ray luminosity between 1999 and 2004 is displayed in figure  [ fig : hist ] . during 19992003 , _ chandra _  detected a marginally - significant excess in the source counts within 1  of cxogc  j174540.0290031 , with an average luminosity of @xmath112  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this emission is probably from nearby young , emission line stars .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath113  erg s@xmath2  as the upper limit to the luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031  during that time period .",
    "this is typical for an lmxb in quiescence .",
    "in contrast , the highest luminosity observed from cxogc  j174540.0290031  with _ chandra _  was only @xmath114  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this luminosity is well below those at which transient lmxbs are typically detected in outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the low luminosity is surprising in the context of the disk - instability models that are typically used to explain the outbursts of lmxbs , which predict that the entire accretion disk is be disrupted , leading to an outburst with @xmath115  erg s@xmath2  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , three observational selection effects could contribute to the low peak luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031 .",
    "first , transient lmxbs have traditionally been identified with wide - field monitoring instruments that only have sensitivities of @xmath116  erg @xmath1 s@xmath2  @xcite , or @xmath11  erg s@xmath2for the galactic center distance .",
    "there are few accreting black holes and neutron stars within 2  kpc of earth , so there is a strong selection effect against finding transients this faint .",
    "second , only a few sensitive x - ray observations of the galactic center have been obtained within the last year , so we may have missed the peak of the outburst .",
    "the first observation of the source in outburst was taken by _",
    "xmm - newton _  in 2004 march ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d. porquet , in prep ) .",
    "they report that the source had a comparable luminosity to that at which we detected the source with _",
    "chandra _  in 2004 july and august . in between time ,",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer",
    "_ carried out scanning observations of the galactic center with proportional counter array @xcite .",
    "these allow us to put an upper limit of @xmath117  erg s@xmath2  on the intensity of the source during 2005 .",
    "this upper limit is at the low end of the luminosities of outbursts often seen from lmxbs .    finally ,",
    "as mentioned above , we observe cxogc  j174540.0290031  along the plane of its binary orbit , so it is likely that the outer accretion disk obscures most of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "these facts motivate us to search for an independent constraint on the x - ray luminosity of the transient outburst .",
    "fortunately , the apparent detection of scattered x - ray emission from the transient outburst in figure  [ fig : img ] provides us with just such a constraint .",
    "the enhancement in the diffuse x - ray emission is coincident with part of a well - known ridge of dust and ionized gas , referred to as the `` minispiral '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : midir ] and [ fig : paalpha ] ) .",
    "although the brightening in diffuse x - rays could represent either scattered x - rays or a mechanical outflow shocking against the surrounding interstellar medium , the morphology and energetics of the observed x - rays makes the first mechanism appear more likely .",
    "first , the diffuse region is separated from the central source by at least 4 light - months and the outburst of cxogc  j174540.0290031  started after june 2003 , so any material that impacted the minispiral must have been traveling faster than @xmath118 .",
    "second , if we interpret the brightening of the diffuse x - rays as an increase in the density of the emitting plasma , then the implied energy input is @xmath119  erg ( table  [ tab : diff ] ) .",
    "therefore , the power required over six months is @xmath16  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "both of these conditions could be fulfilled by a radio jet ( see  4.2 and * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the axis of the observed jet is oriented about 45@xmath103  from the center of the brightening of the diffuse emission .",
    "moreover , the diffuse emission has an extent of @xmath273 , which is vastly more extended than the radio features .",
    "these facts make it seem unlikely that the jet is responsible for the diffuse x - ray emission . instead , we propose that the enhancement in the diffuse emission is produced by x - rays from cxogc  j174540.0290031  that are scattered by electrons in the minispiral .",
    "the ionized gas from this ridge has been extensively studied in radio continuum at 13 mm @xcite and 6 cm @xcite ; hydrogen emission from the h92@xmath24 ( 3.6 cm * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pa@xmath24 ( 1.87 @xmath98 m * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and br@xmath120 ( 2.16 @xmath98 m * ? ? ?",
    "* ) electronic transitions ; and [ ne ii ] emission ( 12.8 @xmath98 m * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ridge is obviously more extended than the brightening of the diffuse emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : paalpha ] ) , which raises the question of why only a small fraction of it has been illuminated .",
    "careful studies of the velocity of the gas in the minispiral have indicated that it is composed of several kinematic features ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paumard , maillard , & morris 2004 ) .",
    "although the complexity of the region precludes any conclusive associations , the enhancement in x - ray flux is coincident with a section of the `` northern arm '' that has a high velocity toward us ( 200 km s@xmath121 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we suggest that this is the only region that has brightened because it is closest to cxogc  j174540.0290031 .",
    "the scattered flux ( @xmath122 ) associated with the outburst of cxogc  j174540.0290031  depends on the luminosity ( @xmath13 ) and distance ( @xmath12 ) of the source , the solid angle ( @xmath123 ) and optical depth ( @xmath124 ) of the scattering region , and the angle ( @xmath125 ) through which photons are scattered : @xmath126 the function @xmath127 depends on the scattering process ; for thompson scattering @xmath128 . the solid angle @xmath123 depends on the distance between the source and the scattering region , and the size of the scatterer .",
    "the projected separation between the two is @xmath272 , so if @xmath125 is the angle between our line of sight and the line connecting the source and the scatterer , the true distance is @xmath129  pc .",
    "the brightening of the diffuse flux is contained in a roughly elliptical region no larger than 30@xmath2316 , so we estimate that the projected area of the scattering region with respect to the source is @xmath130  pc@xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the solid angle of the scatterer is @xmath132 .",
    "the scattering is most likely caused by electrons.100 pc from the minispiral , which in turn would imply that its intrinsic luminosity is @xmath133erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we also see no evidence for fluorescent emission from metals , but this could result from the poor signal - to - noise in the spectrum of the diffuse emission . ]",
    "the electron density in the region of enhanced diffuse x - ray emission has not been measured directly , but the average electron density has been determined over the entire northern arm by @xcite by comparing the pa@xmath24 and h92@xmath24 fluxes .",
    "we use their value of @xmath134 @xmath135 to estimate the optical depth to electron scattering . assuming that the depth of the scattering region is similar to its major axis length , @xmath136  pc , the column density is @xmath137  @xmath1 .",
    "the optical depth to thompson scattering is then @xmath138 .",
    "we have measured the scattered flux , @xmath139  erg @xmath1 s@xmath2  ( 28 kev ; table  [ tab : diff ] ) , so we can solve for the intrinsic luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031  using equation  [ eq : scat ] .",
    "if we assume @xmath140@xmath103 , we find @xmath141  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we consider this to be a conservative estimate of the intrinsic luminosity , because choosing a smaller value for @xmath125 or assuming a smaller depth and projected area for the scattering region would result in an inferred luminosity that is a factor of several higher , up to @xmath142  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the peak luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031  must have been at least @xmath143 times larger than the values observed with _",
    "chandra _   ( table  [ tab : spectra ] and figure  [ fig : hist ] ) . as mentioned above , _",
    "pca observations would have detected an outburst larger than @xmath144  erg s@xmath2 , and therefore conceivably could have missed cxogc  j174540.0290031  at its peak luminosity . however ,",
    "the timing and morphology of the diffuse emission argue that the peak of the outburst should have been detected with _ xmm - newton_. the region of diffuse x - ray emission remained bright for at least two months between 2004 july 5 and august 28 (  2.2 ) , so the luminous portion of the outburst must have lasted at least this long .",
    "the peak of the outburst had to have occurred @xmath145 months prior to the _ chandra _  observations .",
    "this places the peak of the outburst during 2004 march and april , when _ xmm - newton _  observed the source . at that time",
    "the flux was similar to that in our _ chandra _  observations ( * ? ? ? * d. porquet , in prep . ) .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the flux measured from the location of cxogc  j174540.0290031  by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   is only a small fraction of its total output .",
    "indeed , observations of edge - on lmxbs often suggest that their intrinsic luminosities are significantly larger than would be inferred from their observed x - ray fluxes .",
    "for instance , based on the strength of oxygen emission lines in the _ xmm - newton _   reflection grating spectrometer and _ chandra _  high - energy transmission grating spectra of 2s 0921 - 63 , @xcite suggest that only @xmath146% of its total x - ray flux is transmitted toward the observer .",
    "similarly , based on the low observed x - ray to optical flux of the accretion disk corona source x  1822731 , @xcite suggest that we observe only 5% of its total flux .",
    "our measurements of cxogc  j174540.0290031  suggest that an even smaller fraction , @xmath141% , of the total flux is observed .",
    "if indeed the vast majority of the flux from cxogc  j174540.0290031  is obscured by the accretion disk , then it could help explain the fact noted by @xcite that no confirmed black hole lmxb is known with an inclination larger than 75@xmath103.@xmath10275@xmath103  @xcite , although no mass function has yet been measured to confirm the nature of the compact object . ]",
    "if only 1% of the total flux can be detected from a black hole lmxb observed edge - on , then almost all of the black hole transients in @xcite would have apparent @xmath147  erg s@xmath2 , and would have been almost undetectable by the all - sky monitors on _ bepposax _  and _ rxte _  @xcite .",
    "if cxogc  j174540.0290031  contains a black hole primary , then it could be the first such system observed edge - on .",
    "vla observations by @xcite revealed two new radio sources that appeared coincident with the x - ray outburst of cxogc  j174540.0290031 .",
    "the x - ray source was located on the line between the two radio features , which suggests that they are produced by synchrotron emission from a jet launched by the x - ray source .",
    "the peak intensity was observed in 2004 march , with @xmath148 mjy , or @xmath149 erg s@xmath2at 43 ghz . in 2004",
    "july , only the eastern feature was detected , with a flux density of @xmath150 mjy at 43 ghz , or @xmath151 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the intensity varied by @xmath152% from day - to - day .",
    "the spectrum of the emission is uncertain , because even when measurements were made at multiple frequencies , vlbi observations revealed that the sources were resolved , and therefore each frequency samples a different spatial scale from the jet .",
    "it is also noteworthy that , unlike the relativistically - expanding jets often seen from lmxbs @xcite , there was no proper motion of the radio sources along the jet axis ( although there was some perpendicular to that axis ; see bower  2005 for further discussion ) .",
    "therefore , the radio features probably formed where the jet impacted the interstellar medium .",
    "indeed , the mid - infrared image in figure  [ fig : midir ] reveals a significant amount of dust that is near in projection to cxogc  j174540.0290031 , particularly at the location of the brighter , eastern radio feature .",
    "the radio luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031is unusually large compared to the x - ray luminosity that we infer from the light echo , @xmath141  erg s@xmath2 .",
    "first , lmxbs typically are observed to produce extended radio jets only during outbursts with peak luminosities of @xmath153  erg s@xmath2   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the only sources fainter than this that produced radio outbursts are sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( @xmath154  erg s@xmath2 ) and xte j1118@xmath155480 ( @xmath156  erg s@xmath2 ) , and in neither case was a jet resolved .",
    "second , the ratio of the peak x - ray to radio luminosities for lmxbs in @xcite is typically @xmath157 , whereas that from cxogc  j174540.0290031  is @xmath158 . for comparison ,",
    "the three lmxbs in @xcite with the brightest radio emission relative to their x - ray emission are xte j1748288 ( @xmath159 = 5.8 $ ] ) , gro j165540 ( @xmath159 = 5.4 $ ] ) , and cir x-1 in the 1970s [ @xmath160 = 5.3 $ ] ) .",
    "the unexpectedly bright radio emission from cxogc  j174540.0290031  probably results from the fact that the jet radiated with unusually high efficiently when it impacted the surrounding ism .",
    "finally , we can compute a lower limit to the power required to produce the radio - emitting jet by assuming that it contains only electrons and positrons , that these particles are in equipartition with the magnetic field , and that the volume ( @xmath161 ) of the emitting region is related to the time scale on which the jet is produced ( @xmath162 ) by @xmath163 ( fender , belloni , & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "if we assume that the slope of the radio spectrum is @xmath164 , the minimum energy is given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the time over which the jet was launched in days , @xmath167 is the lowest frequency at which the radio emission was observed , @xmath168 is the flux density in mjy at that frequency , and @xmath12 is the distance in units of 8  kpc ( * ? ? ?",

    "this power is comparable to the x - ray luminosity inferred from the diffuse x - ray light echo , which suggests that about half of the accretion energy is channeled into launching the radio jet .",
    "several theoretical arguments have suggested that lmxbs accreting at low rates release much of their energy as a jet ( e.g. , markoff , falcke , & fender 2001 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these observations of cxogc  j174540.0290031   provide the most direct evidence yet that this is in fact true .",

    "[ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "however , the diffuse x - ray emission within 4 light - months of the source has also brightened ( fig  [ fig : img ] ) , probably because electrons in the ridge of gas and dust referred to as the the minispiral ( fig .",

    "<S> recent x - ray and radio observations have identified a transient low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) located only 0.1 pc in projection from the galactic center , cxogc  j174540.0290031  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we report the detailed analysis of x - ray and infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings . _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _  observations detect the source at a flux of @xmath0  erg @xmath1 s@xmath2  ( 28 kev ) . after accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in material local to the source , </S>",
    "<S> the implied luminosity of the source is only @xmath3  erg s@xmath2  ( 28  kev ; @xmath4  kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the diffuse x - ray emission near the source also brightened by a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced diffuse x - ray emission lies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared images . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the x - ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst , and determine that the peak luminosity of cxogc  j174540.0290031was @xmath5  erg s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact that the system is observed nearly edge - on , so that the accretion disk intercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the inferred peak x - ray luminosity to that of the radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the x - ray to radio luminosities , @xmath6 , is considerably smaller than in other known lmxbs ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually high efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid - infrared images of the surrounding dust . finally , we find that the minimum power required to produce the jet , @xmath8  erg s@xmath2 , is comparable to the inferred peak x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most direct evidence yet obtained that lmxbs accreting at low rates release about half of their energy as jets . </S>"
