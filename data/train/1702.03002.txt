    "if we exclude the poorer weather band  3 observations , then we obtained 101  hours on the field , roughly equally divided between the two scanning modes .",
    "while scuba-2 obtains simultaneous 450@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m observations , the predominantly band  2 weather implies that the 450@xmath0 m observations are not extremely deep , and we focus primarily on the 850@xmath0 m data .",
    "our reduction procedures follow those described in chen et al .",
    "( 2013b ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the dynamic iterative map maker ( dimm ) ( jenness et al .",
    "2011 ; chapin et al .",
    "dimm performs iterative estimations on the common mode signal , the astronomical signal , and the white noise .",
    "it also applies flat - field and extinction corrections and uses a fourier transform filter to remove low - frequency excess signal relative to the white noise that is not able to be removed through common mode subtraction ( chapin et al .",
    "we used the standard configuration faint source file _",
    "dimmconfig_blank_field.lis_. we ran dimm on each bolometer subarray individually to avoid data splitting , and we used the mosaic_jcmt_images recipe in the pipeline for combining and analyzing reduced data ( picard ; jenness et al .",

    "we expect nearly all the galaxies to be much smaller than the @xmath3214@xmath33 resolution of the jcmt at 850@xmath0 m and hence to appear as unresolved sources .",

    "2003 ) . assuming @xmath34 and @xmath35(i , j ) are the signal and r.m.s noise maps produced by dimm and @xmath36 is the signal point spread function ,",

    "however , the map produced from dimm has low spatial frequency structures that need to be removed .",
    "thus , before running the matched - filter , we convolved the map with a broad gaussian normalized to a sum of unity , and we subtracted this convolved map from the original map .",
    "chen et al .  ( 2013b ) showed that the source fluxes and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) are not sensitive to the size of the fwhm for reasonable choices .",
    "we adopted values of @xmath43 at 450@xmath0 m and @xmath44 at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "the psf used for the matched - filter must be processed in the same way , which results in a mexican hat - like wavelet with the central gaussian surrounded by a negative trough .",
    "-1.5 cm        we calibrated the fluxes using standard flux conversion factors ( fcfs ; 491jypw@xmath13 for 450@xmath0 m and 537jypw@xmath13 for 850@xmath0",
    "we applied 10% upward corrections to compensate for the flux lost during filtering ( chen et al .",

    "2013 ) are accurate to better than 10% based on the variation in the calibrators and the comparison with the sma data .    in figure  [ pretty_850](a ) , we show the 850@xmath0 m image made from all of the observations , including the band 3 data . in figure  [ pretty_850](b ) , we show the rms noise as a function of the offset angle from the centroid position . in figure",

    "we present the scuba-2 catalogs in section  [ catalog ] ; the 850@xmath0 m sample can be found in table  5 .    given the number of resolution elements ( @xmath45 ) in the scuba-2 image , a normal distribution would give @xmath46 false sources at the @xmath3 level . in order to address systematic effects",

    ", we first cleaned the image of all the positively detected sources .",
    "we then searched for sources in the negative of the image , finding four sources with fluxes above 2mjy and s / n above 4 .",
    "this may be compared with the 156 sources detected in the positive image with the same thresholds .",
    "the central regions of the 850@xmath0 m image have very low noise , and confusion effects may become significant ( e.g. , condon 1992 ) .",
    "( confusion may be safely ignored in the 450@xmath0 m image , which is higher resolution and shallower . )",
    "there are two types of confusion : the first is blending , which is usually considered to become important when there is more than one source per 30 beams , and the second is noise from sources below the flux limit of interest , which we call @xmath47 .",
    "the total noise is the combination of the noise measured from the scuba-2 signal , which we refer to as the statistical noise , @xmath48 , and @xmath47 ; it is given by @xmath49 .",
    "we can estimate both the blending limit and @xmath47 from the fits to the 850@xmath0 m counts of hsu et al .",
    "based on the counts , we find more than one source per 30 beams below 1.64mjy , which is a lower flux than that of any of the sources in the present sample . thus , blending is not that important for our sample . in order to estimate @xmath47 , we simulated an image using the counts and the psf of the matched - filter image and then measured the dispersion in the simulated image .",
    "we found @xmath50mjy for sources with fluxes less than 2mjy .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is not sensitive to the low flux cutoff , which we took as 0.005mjy .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath47 directly from the image by comparing the measured dispersion with the statistical noise . as the statistical noise becomes smaller",
    ", we expect to see the measured noise rise above it and reach a constant value equal to @xmath47 . in figure  [ confused](a ) , using only the portion of the image with noise less than 0.6mjy , we show the distribution of the actual s / n relative to the statistical noise for both the raw matched - filter image ( blue curve ) and the matched - filter image with the sources brighter than 2mjy removed ( black curve ) . the red curve shows the expectation from the statistical noise alone .",
    "the figure emphasizes the importance of removing the brighter sources , which otherwise would dominate the noise , but even with these removed , the black curve is wider than the red curve due to the confusion noise . in figure  [ confused](b ) , we show the comparison of the measured noise in radial annuli ( the statistical noise increases with radius ) versus the mean statistical noise in each annulus .",
    "the black squares show the values measured from the matched - filter image , and the red squares the values measured from the matched - filter image with the sources brighter than 2mjy removed . the black squares have a median value of @xmath51mjy for the points with statistical noise less tha 0.6mjy , which is very similar to that measured by geach et al .",
    "( 2017 ) for the same quantity .",
    "this noise is dominated by the brighter sources and shows significant variation due to the small number statistics of these sources . in order to measure @xmath47 from the faint sources",
    "only , we use the measured noise with the bright sources removed .",
    "we can compare this with the statistical noise ( black curve ) to estimate the @xmath47 from sources fainter than 2mjy .",
    "the red curve shows the result of adding @xmath50 in quadrature to the statistical noise ; it gives a good approximation to the values measured from the image with the sources brighter than 2mjy removed .",
    "this value of @xmath47 is in good agreement with the value that we estimated from the counts and is comparable to the minimum statistical noise in the image .",
    "thus , we conclude that we are just reaching the confusion noise limit in the image .",
    "we finally tested the completeness of source recovery in the central region .",
    "to do so , we added a small number of sources ( usually 5 ) of a given flux at random positions in the central low noise portion of the image ( @xmath52mjy ) .",
    "we then ran the finding procedure to obtain the source list including the introduced sources .",
    "we considered a source to be recovered if it was within @xmath53 of the original position and had a flux that was less than @xmath54 different from its actual value .",
    "we repeated the procedure 100 times for each flux .",
    "we summarize the results in table  2 for sources with input fluxes of 5mjy , 3mjy , and 2mjy , where we give the input flux , the percentage recovered , the mean recovered flux divided by the input flux , and the dispersion of the recovered sources , which we show as the the mean statistical noise of the sample together with the additional @xmath47 required to match the measured dispersion .",
    "we omit @xmath47 from the table for the 2mjy sources where the dispersion is biased by the omission of the downward scattered sources which are not recoverd .",

    "<S> in this first paper in the super goods series on powerfully star - forming galaxies in the two goods fields , we present a deep scuba-2 survey of the goods - n at both 850@xmath0 m and 450@xmath0 m ( central rms noise of 0.28mjy and 2.6mjy , respectively ) . in the central region the 850@xmath0 m observations cover the goods - n to near the confusion limit of @xmath1  mjy , while over a wider 450arcmin@xmath2 region  </S>",

    "<S> we show that the redshift distribution increases with increasing flux , and we parameterize the dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the star formation history and the star formation rate ( sfr ) density distribution functions in various redshift intervals , finding that they reach a peak at @xmath5 before dropping to higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the number density per unit volume of sfr@xmath6 galaxies measured from the scuba-2 sample does not change much relative to that of lower sfr galaxies from uv selected samples over @xmath7 , suggesting that , apart from changes in the normalization , the shape in the number density as a function of sfr is invariant over this redshift interval . </S>"
