    "is considered to be independent of the light quark and is decayed as a free particle according to the @xmath65 weak interaction  @xcite .",

    "the latter is defined as @xmath76 , the average transverse momentum , @xmath77 , squared transferred from the medium to the parton per unit mean free path @xmath78 .",
    "it is expected to be proportional to the volume density @xmath79 of gluons in the medium ( thus , to its energy density ) and to the typical momentum transfer per scattering .",
    "we calculate the energy loss @xmath72 following the monte carlo approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for light quarks and gluons , and adapted for heavy quarks in refs .",
    "we start by sampling the heavy - quark kinematics , @xmath5 and @xmath57 , according to the nlo double - differential cross section .",

    "we do not include the expansion of the medium in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "however , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , numerically , the effects of a time - dependent medium on parton energy loss can be accounted for by an equivalent static medium , specified in terms of the time - averaged transport coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "this is confirmed by recent works ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , showing that the inclusion of the medium evolution by a full hydrodynamical simulation does not significantly change or improve , with respect to the assumption of a static medium , the results for the suppression of the high-@xmath5 @xmath0 in central collisions at rhic .",
    "we assume that our approach for the estimation of @xmath75 is valid for rapidities belonging to the `` central plateau '' of the charged particle distribution  @xcite , which is expected to be as large as @xmath85 at lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "we now sample a @xmath72 value , according to the quenching weight @xmath86 , and we modify the quark kinematics to ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , heavy quarks that lose all their energy ( @xmath89 ) are redistributed according to the thermal distribution @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the muons from the decay of these thermalized quarks populate the region @xmath92 , outside the range of interest for the present study .",
    "we assume the heavy - quark rapidity to stay constant during the process of energy loss , since heavy quarks co - move with the longitudinally - expanding medium and any modification of the initial heavy - quark rapidity should remain small .",
    "finally , we apply fragmentation and decay as described in section  [ sec : hq ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the local @xmath24 transverse profile at central rapidity ( @xmath93 ) is assumed to be proportional to the density of binary collisions . since we want to study muon production in a broad rapidity range ( @xmath94 ) , we introduce a dependence of the local @xmath24 on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath95 in order to account for the reduced medium density in the forward direction .",
    "namely , we assume the transport coefficient @xmath96 to scale as a function of pseudo - rapidity according to the gluon pseudo - rapidity density of the medium @xmath97 , this choice being justified by the fact that @xmath79 scales in @xmath95 according to @xmath97 .",
    "we assume the pseudo - rapidity density of charged particles and the pseudo - rapidity density of gluons to have the same dependence on @xmath95 and we write  @xcite : @xmath98\\ , , \\label{eq : qhatscale}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is a constant that sets the scale of @xmath24 .",
    "we use two values of @xmath99 that were estimated for central collisions at @xmath23 by scaling the values extracted from an analysis of the light - flavour hadrons suppression at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values for the parton - averaged ( @xmath100 ) and time - averaged ( @xmath101 ) transport coefficient , for simplicity . ] are @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for the pseudo - rapidity dependence we use the pseudo - rapidity distribution of charged particles predicted for collisions at the lhc in ref .",
    "the effect of this dependence on the suppression of muons from heavy - quark decays is expected to be small , because @xmath104 is predicted to have only a modest variation in the range @xmath105 ( for illustration , for @xmath106 it would be reduced by about @xmath107 with respect to @xmath108 ) .    before presenting our results , we point out that , in addition to radiative energy loss , there are other possible medium - induced effects ( e.g. : collisional energy loss of heavy quarks  @xcite , in - medium hadronization and dissociation of heavy - flavour hadrons  @xcite , formation of bound states and hadronization of heavy quarks via coalescence  @xcite ) that could noticeably affect the muon spectrum for @xmath109 .",
    "these effects have not been considered in the present study .",
    "and one has to keep in mind that all current jet quenching models do not describe the suppression of single non - photonic electron @xmath5 spectra at rhic equally well as they do describe the suppression of pion spectra .",
    "it is with this caveat that one should view the predictions for lhc based on these models .",
    "we start by presenting , in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the muon production cross - section as a function of transverse momentum in the 10% most central collisions at @xmath110  tev , when only nuclear shadowing is included .",
    "the contributions from charm , beauty and weak gauge bosons are shown separately .",
    "muons from charged pion and kaon decays and from drell - yan processes ( @xmath111 ) are ignored here , because both are expected to be negligible in the transverse momentum range @xmath112  @xcite . due to their large masses , w and z bosons",
    "are mainly produced with small transverse momentum , @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the decay muons have typically @xmath114 .",
    "the latest qualitatively explains the shape of the @xmath5 distribution of muons from the decay of the w and z , which `` peaks '' at @xmath115 . among the contributions that we compute , muons from charm decays are predominant in the low-@xmath5 range , 2@xmath22 . in the range 4@xmath116 beauty decays prevail , and at larger @xmath7 the w decays represent the largest contribution to the muon spectra .",
    "we may note that these values for the `` crossing points '' in @xmath5 are somewhat dependent on the perturbative uncertainties of nlo calculations ( choice of the fragmentation and renormalization scales ) and on other systematics in the fragmentation and decay kinematics .",
    "for example , a variation of @xmath117 of yield of the beauty component ( see section  [ sec : hq ] ) implies a shift of the crossing point by approximately @xmath118 . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the experimental measurement of the ratio of positive - to - negative muons could help to determine these crossing points .",
    "for illustration of the expected significance for high-@xmath5 muons , we quote the production yield of muons from w decay in minimum - bias collisions at @xmath23 for an integrated luminosity of @xmath119 ( the expected integrated luminosity to be collected by each of the three experiments within one month of data - taking ) . in this case ,",
    "about @xmath120 muons from w decays will be produced in the range @xmath121 .",
    "out of them , about @xmath122 will be produced in @xmath123 and @xmath124 in @xmath125 .    in view of exploring the final - state effects ( heavy - quark energy loss ) on the muon spectrum ,",
    "we first focus on the influence of the initial - state effects , i.e. nuclear shadowing , by analysing the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 as a function of transverse momentum ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the short - dashed and dotted lines represent the heavy - quark decays contributions ; at low @xmath7 ( @xmath126@xmath22 ) they probe the small @xmath127 range of the gluon pdf @xmath128 , where , according to the eks98 parametrization  @xcite , we have shadowing : the pdf in the pb nucleus is suppressed with respect to the pdf in the free proton ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath130 . for larger muon @xmath7 ( @xmath131 ) a higher @xmath127 range is probed , and we begin to explore the anti - shadowing region ( @xmath132 ) , so @xmath133 as is observed in fig .",

    "the @xmath127 values were obtained using the pythia event generator for the leading order processes @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",

    ". the overall nuclear modification factor of muons ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) increases rapidly with @xmath7 up to a value of about @xmath145 and then decreases to about @xmath144 . in order to explore the uncertainties due to the limited knowledge of the nuclear pdfs in the kinematic region relevant to our study , we considered two other parametrizations of the nuclear parton distribution : nds  @xcite and hkn07  @xcite .",
    "the values of the corresponding shadowing factors are reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "we note that the shadowing factor uncertainty for heavy quarks at high @xmath5 is 7% and for weak gauge boson is less than 5% . for heavy quarks at low @xmath5 ,",
    "it becomes as large as 20% for charm and 10% for beauty .",

    "the effect of heavy - quark energy loss on the differential cross section of muons produced in and pp collisions at lhc energies has been investigated .",
    "the most important contributions to the decay muon yield in the range @xmath189 have been included : b ( and c ) quarks have been computed using a nlo pqcd calculation supplemented with the bdmps mass - dependent quenching weights ; weak gauge bosons muonic decays have been computed using the pythia event generator . the heavy - quark mass - dependence of energy loss reduces the suppression of muon yields from beauty decays by about factor two for @xmath190 . to account for the decrease of the medium density at large pseudo - rapidity",
    ", we assumed a decrease of the transport coefficient proportionally to @xmath104 , and we found that the effect on the muon @xmath5 distribution is negligible , especially at large transverse momentum .",
    "we investigated the energy loss effect by means of the -to - pp and of the central - to - peripheral nuclear modification factors in the acceptance of the lhc experiments : atlas , alice , and cms . in the @xmath5 interval below approximately @xmath191 , where the beauty component is dominant , @xmath0 for 010% central collisions relative to pp and @xmath1 for 010% relative to 4070% collisions",
    "are found to be about 0.20.4 and 0.30.5 , respectively .",
    "then , we observe a steep rise in the beauty / w crossover interval 20@xmath192 , up to the values @xmath193 and @xmath194 in the interval above @xmath192 , dominated by w / z decay muons .",
    "these muon nuclear modification factors could provide the first experimental observation of the b quark medium - induced suppression in collisions at the lhc .",
    "the presence of a medium - blind component ( muons from w and z decays ) that dominates the high-@xmath5 muon yield will allow an intrinsic calibration of the medium - sensitive probe ( heavy quarks ) , because it will provide a handle on the strength of the initial - state effects that may alter the hard - scattering cross sections in nucleus ",
