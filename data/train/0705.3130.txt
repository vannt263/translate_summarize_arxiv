    "we , therefore , as the first step to clarify the creation mechanism , investigated , by computer simulation , collision process of hydrogen atoms and one graphene sheet , which is regarded as one of basic processes of complex plasma - carbon interaction in the previous works@xcite . from the previous works in which an incident hydrogen kinetic energy @xmath2 is less than 100 ev to compare with experiments , it was found that an hydrogen - absorption ratio of one graphene sheet depends on the incident hydrogen energy , and that the collision mechanism between a graphene and a hydrogen can be classified into three types of processes : absorption process , reflection process , and penetration process ( see fig . [ fig:2](a ) ) .",
    "moreover , it was also found that when hydrogen atom is absorbed by graphene , the nearest carbon atom overhangs from the graphene which we called  overhang structure \" .",
    "based on the above results , as the second step , simulation model were extended@xcite from a single graphene sheet to multilayer graphene sheets , which is a more realistic sputtering process of graphene sheets and hydrogen atoms than the previous work@xcite . from the second work@xcite , we found the following fact : breaking the covalent bonds between carbon atoms by hydrogen does not play an important role during destruction process of graphene structure , but momentum transfer from incident hydrogen to graphene causes to destroy graphene structure .",
    "moreover , it was found@xcite , that almost all fragments of graphene sheets form chain - shaped molecules , and that yielded hydrocarbon molecules are composed of carbon chain and single hydrogen - atom .",

    "we obtain three chemical reaction ratios for h , d , or t by counting each a reaction .",
    "we observed three kinds of reactions between the single hydrogen isotope atom and the graphene by cmd simulation , which are absorption reaction , reflection reaction and penetration reaction ( see fig . [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we found the following differences of the reflection and the absorption ratios among three isotopes . on the other hand ,",
    "the penetration ratio has almost the same @xmath14 dependence .      from the previous work@xcite",

    "the reflection ratio is almost one for all isotopes .",
    "this behavior is explained by the fact that the reflection in this energy region is derived by the repulsive force of @xmath0electrons over graphene surface@xcite , which does not depend on the mass of the incident isotope .",
    "as @xmath14 is getting larger than 0.5 ev , the reflection ratios are decreasing , and then it is increasing by the nuclear repulsive force of the carbon atom .",

    "[ fig : ref ] .",
    "the absorption ratio has two peaks at @xmath25ev and 24 ev .",
    "one peak denotes the overhang state in the positive @xmath1 side of the graphite , and the other peak is the overhang state in the negative @xmath1 side@xcite . from fig .",

    "the origin of the mass dependence of the absorption ratio is the same one as that of the reflection ratio in  [ sec.ref ] . the velocity becomes slower as the mass becomes large .",
