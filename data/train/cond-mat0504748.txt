    "in the last few years quantum algebra and quantum groups have been the subject of intensive research in several physical fields .",
    "although some properties of these structures still deserve more study in order to provide full clarity , it was quite clear from the beginning that the basic features of these generalized theories are strongly connected with a deep physical meaning and not merely a mathematical exercise .",
    "quantum algebra and quantum groups , which first emerged in connection with the quantum inverse scattering theory and statistical mechanics model @xcite , where the quantum yang - baxter equation plays a crucial role , have found recent important applications in many physical and mathematical problems , such as conformal field theory , integrable systems , non - commutative geometry , knot theory , thermostatistical models and in a wide range of applications envisaged , from cosmic strings and black holes to the fractional quantum hall effect and high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .    from the seminal work of biedenharn @xcite and macfarlane @xcite it was clear that the @xmath0-calculus , originally introduced at the beginning of this century by jackson @xcite in the study of the basic hypergeometric function , it plays a central role in the representation of the quantum groups @xcite .",
    "in fact it has been shown that it is possible to obtain a  coordinate \" realization of the fock space of the @xmath0-oscillators by using the deformed jackson derivative ( jd ) or the so - called @xmath0-derivative operator @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the paper of celeghini et al .",
    "@xcite , the quantum weyl - heisemberg algebra is studied in the frame of the fock - bargmann representation and is incorporated into the theory of entire analytic functions allowing a deeper mathematical understanding of squeezed states , relation between coherent states , lattice quantum mechanics and bloch functions .",
    "furthermore , in the recent past there has been increasing emphasis in quantum statistics different from that of standard bosons and fermions . since the pioneering work of gentile and green @xcite ,",
    "there have been many extensions beyond the standard statistics , among the others we may list the following : parastatistics , fractional statistics , quon statistics , anyon statistics and quantum groups statistics . in the literature",
    "there are two principal methods of introducing an intermediate statistical behavior .",
    "the first is to deform the quantum algebra of the commutation - anticommutation relations thus deforming the exchange factor between permuted particles .",
    "the second method is based on modifying the number of ways of assigning particles to a collection of states and thus the statistical weight of the many - body system .",
    "one interesting realization of the first approach is the study of exactly solvable statistical systems which has led to the theory of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator @xcite , based on the construction of su@xmath2(2 ) algebra of @xmath0-deformed commutation or anticommutation relations between creation and annihilation operators .",
    "such an algebra opens the possibility to study intermediate @xmath0-boson and @xmath0-fermion statistical behavior @xcite and to introduce a generalized thermostatistics based on the formalism of the @xmath0-calculus @xcite . in this context ,",
    "based on the formulation of generalized statistical mechanics in connection with @xmath0-deformed calculus , it has been pointed out that the thermal average of an operator is closely related to quantum algebra @xcite in a fully developed scheme .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first , we want to show that the realization of the thermostatistics of @xmath0-deformed algebra can be built on the formalism of @xmath0-calculus and that the entire structure of thermodynamics is preserved if we use the ( non - commutative ) jd instead of the ordinary thermodynamic derivative .",
    "second , starting from the observation that the creation and annihilation operators in the quantum @xmath0-deformed su@xmath2(2 ) algebra correspond classically to non - commuting coordinates in a @xmath0-phase - space and the commutation relation between the standard quantum operators corresponds classically to the poisson bracket ( pb ) , we want to introduce a @xmath0-deformation of the pb ( @xmath0-pb ) in order to define a generalized @xmath0-deformed dynamics in a non - commutative phase - space .",
    "the motivation for this second goal lies in the fact that a full understanding of the physical origin of @xmath0-deformation in classical physics is still lacking because it is not clear if there exists a classical counterpart to the quantum groups .",
    "it is thus an outstanding question : how can classical dynamics be formulated such that , upon canonical quantization , one recovers the deformed quantum @xmath0-oscillator theory .",
    "the problem of a possible @xmath0-deformation of classical mechanics was dealt with in ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath0-pb has been obtained starting from a point of view different from the one adopted in this paper .",
    "as the quantum @xmath0-deformation plays a crucial role in the interpretation of several complex physical systems , we expect that a classical @xmath0-deformation of the dynamics can be very relevant in several problems @xcite .",
    "a remarkable example is the tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics @xcite , based on a classical deformation of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , where the thermodynamic functions , such as entropy and internal energy , are deformed , but the whole structure of thermodynamics is preserved .",
    "many investigations are devoted to the relevance of such a classical theory in several physical applications @xcite .",
    "the main approach we shall follow to introduce the classical correspondence of quantum @xmath0-oscillator is based on the following idea .",
    "the ( undeformed ) quantum commutation relations are invariant under the action of su(2 ) and , as a consequence , the @xmath0-deformed commutation relations are invariant under the action of su@xmath2(2 ) .",
    "analogously , since the ( undeformed ) pb is invariant under the action of the symplectic group sp(1 ) , we have to require that @xmath0-pb must satisfy invariance over the action of the @xmath0-deformed symplectic group sp@xmath3(1 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we review the fundamental relations in the @xmath0-heisenberg algebra of creation and annihilation operators and we derive the statistical distribution for @xmath0-boson gas . in sec .",
    "3 we introduce a self - consistent prescription for the use of the jd in the thermodynamical relations . in sec . 4",
    ", we define the non - commutative @xmath0-differential calculus in the @xmath0-deformed phase - space invariant over the action of the gl@xmath2(2 ) and in sec .",
    "5 we introduce the @xmath0-symplectic group and the @xmath0-pb .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "we shall briefly review the theory of @xmath0-deformed bosons defined by the @xmath0-heisenberg algebra of creation and annihilation operators of bosons introduced by biedenharn and mcfarlane @xcite , derivable through a map from su@xmath2(2 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-boson algebra is determined by the following commutation relations for annihilation and creation operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the number operator @xmath6 , thus ( for simplicity we omit the particle index ) @xmath7=[a^\\dag , a^\\dag]=0 \\ ; , \\ \\ \\ aa^\\dag - q^2 a^\\dag a = 1 \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath8= a^\\dag \\ ; , \\ \\ \\ [ n , a]=-a\\ ; .\\ ] ] the @xmath0-fock space spanned by the orthornormalized eigenstates @xmath9 is constructed according to @xmath10 ! } } \\vert 0\\rangle \\ ; , \\ \\ \\",

    "the actions of @xmath4 , @xmath16 on the fock state @xmath17 are given by @xmath18^{1/2 } \\vert n+1\\rangle\\ ; , \\\\ a \\vert n\\rangle&=&[n]^{1/2 } \\vert n-1\\rangle \\ ; , \\\\",
    "n \\vert n\\rangle&=&n\\vert n\\rangle \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above relations , it follows that @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we observe that the fock space of the @xmath0-bosons has the same structure as the standard bosons but with the replacement @xmath21!$ ] .",
    "moreover the number operator is not @xmath22 but can be expressed as the nonlinear functional relation @xmath23 which can be explicitly obtained formally in the closed form @xmath24 the transformation from fock observables to the configuration space ( bargmann holomorphic representation ) may be accomplished by choosing @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the jd @xcite defined by @xmath27 which reduces to the ordinary derivative when @xmath0 goes to unity and therefore , the jd occurs naturally in @xmath0-deformed structures . in an analogous manner , we will see below that jd plays a crucial role in the @xmath0-deformed classical mechanics also .",
    "the thermal average of an operator is written in the standard form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the grand canonical partition function defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "henceforward we shall set boltzmann constant to unity .    by using the definition in eq.([bn ] ) of the @xmath0-basic number",
    ", the mean value of the occupation number @xmath32 can be calculated starting from the relation @xmath33=\\frac{1}{\\cal z}\\ , tr\\left ( e^{-\\beta h } a^\\dag_i",
    "a_i\\right ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] as outlined before , the consistency of this approach is warranted by the fact that the thermal averages of an operator is related with quantum algebra in a fully consistent scheme @xcite .    in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", the hamiltonian of the non - interacting boson gas is expected to have the following form @xmath34 where the index @xmath35 is the state label , @xmath36 is the chemical potential and @xmath37 is the kinetic energy in the state @xmath35 with the number operator @xmath38 .",
    "therefore from eq.([14 ] ) , after simple manipulations the explicit expression for the mean occupation number can be determined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fugacity .",
    "it is easy to see that the above equation reduces to the standard bose - einstein distribution when @xmath41 .",
    "the total number of particles is given by @xmath42 .",
    "from the definition of the partition function , and the hamiltonian , it follows that the logarithm of the partition function has the same structure as that of the standard boson @xmath43 this is due to the fact that we have chosen the hamiltonian to be a linear function of the number operator but it is not linear in @xmath22 as seen from eq.([nop ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the standard thermodynamic relations in the usual form are ruled out .",
    "it is verified , for instance , that @xmath44 as the coordinate space representation of the @xmath0-boson algebra is realized by the introduction of the jd ( see eq.([jd ] ) ) , we stress that the key point of the @xmath0-deformed thermostatistics is in the observation that the ordinary thermodynamic derivative with respect to @xmath45 , must be replaced by the jd @xcite @xmath46 consequently , the number of particles in the @xmath0-deformed theory can be derived from the relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mean occupation number expressed in eq.([nqi ] ) .",
    "the usual leibniz chain rule is ruled out for the jd and therefore derivatives encountered in thermodynamics must be modified according to the following prescription .",
    "first we observe that the jd applies only with respect to the variable in the exponential form such as @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "therefore for the @xmath0-deformed case , any thermodynamic derivative of functions which depend on @xmath45 or @xmath51 must be converted to derivatives in one of these variables by using the ordinary chain rule and then applying the jd with respect to the exponential variable .",
    "for example , the internal energy in the @xmath0-deformed case can be written as @xmath52 in this case we obtain the correct form of the internal energy @xmath53 this prescription is a crucial point of our approach because this allows us to maintain the whole structure of thermodynamics and the validity of the legendre transformations in a fully consistent manner .",
    "for instance , in light of the above discussion , we have the recipe to derive the entropy of the @xmath0-bosons which leads to @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath6 are the modified functions expressed in eqs.([int ] ) and ( [ num ] ) and @xmath57 is the thermodynamic potential .",
    "after some manipulations , we obtain the entropy as follows @xmath58+(\\nq+1)\\ ,   \\log\\ , [ \\nq+1]- \\log\\ , ( [ \\nq+1]-[\\nq ] ) \\big \\ } \\ ; . \\label{entro}\\ ] ]",
    "in the above sections we have seen that the non - commutative jd and the @xmath0-calculus play a crucial role in the definition of the @xmath0-deformed quantum mechanics and quantum thermodynamics .",
    "we would now like to introduce an analogous @xmath0-deformation in classical theory .",
    "since the creation and annihilation operators in the quantum @xmath0-deformed su@xmath2(2 ) algebra correspond classically to non - commuting coordinates in a @xmath0-phase - space , in this section we introduce the @xmath0-deformed plane which is generated by the non - commutative elements @xmath59 and @xmath60 fulfilling the relation @xcite @xmath61 which is invariant under gl@xmath2(2 ) transformations ( see later ) .",
    "henceforward , for simplicity , we shall limit ourselves to consider the two - dimensional case .    from eq.([qplane ] ) the @xmath0-calculus on the @xmath0-plane can be obtained formally through the introduction of the @xmath0-derivatives @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite @xmath64 they fulfill the @xmath0-leibniz rule @xmath65 together with the @xmath0-commutative derivative @xmath66 it is easy to see that in the @xmath41 limit one recovers the ordinary commutative calculus .",
    "let us outline the asymmetric mixed derivative relations eq.([pp ] ) and eq.([xx ] ) in @xmath59 and in @xmath60 .",
    "these properties come directly from the non - commutative structure of the @xmath0-plane defined in eq.([qplane ] ) .",
    "we recall now that the most general function on the @xmath0-plane can be expressed as a polynomial in the @xmath0-variable @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath67 where we have assumed the @xmath59-@xmath60 ordering prescription ( it can be always accomplished by means of eq . ( [ qplane ] ) ) .",
    "thus , taking into account eqs.([pp])-([xx ] ) , we obtain the action of the @xmath0-derivatives on the monomials @xmath68\\,\\hat x^{n-1}\\,\\hat p^m \\ , \\label{dxmon}\\\\ & & \\hat\\partial_p(\\hat x^n\\,\\hat p^m)=[m]\\,q^n\\,\\hat x^n\\,\\hat p^{m-1 } \\ , \\label{dpmon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 $ ] is the same @xmath0-basic number introduced in eq.([bn ] ) .",
    "a realization of the above @xmath0-algebra and its @xmath0-calculus can be accomplished by the replacements @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dilatation operator along the @xmath15 direction ( reducing to the identity operator for @xmath41 ) , whereas @xmath72 are the jd with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath73 .",
    "their action on an arbitrary function @xmath74 is @xmath75 therefore , as a consequence of the non - commutative structure of the @xmath0-plane , in this realization the @xmath59 coordinate becomes a @xmath76-number and its derivative is the jd whereas the @xmath60 coordinate and its derivative are realized in terms of the dilatation operator and jd .",
    "after the formulation of the @xmath0-differential calculus , we are now able to introduce a @xmath0-pb .",
    "as previously stated , since the undeformed pb is invariant under the action of the undeformed symplectic group sp(1 ) , we will assume , as a fundamental point , that the @xmath0-pb must satisfy the invariance property under the action of the @xmath0-deformed symplectic group sp@xmath2(1 ) with the same value of the deformed parameter @xmath0 used in the construction of the quantum plane .    let us start by recalling the classical definition of a 2-poisson manifold , which is a two dimensional euclidean space @xmath77 generated by the position and momentum variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 and equipped with a pb . if @xmath74 and @xmath80 are smooth functions , the pb is defined as @xcite @xmath81 eq .",
