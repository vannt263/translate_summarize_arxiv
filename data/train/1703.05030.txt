    "sfxts are celestial objects characterized by outbursts of brief duration ( with the brightest phase typically concentrated in one day ) made of a sequence of luminous x  ray flares ( normally reaching 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath5  erg  s@xmath4 ) , each flare lasting a few thousand seconds at most .",
    "sfxts are associated with early - type supergiants , making them a subclass of hmxbs .",
    "their x  ray properties were quickly recognized as a challenge to the accretion models : apparently , sfxts share similar properties ( donor spectral type , orbital geometry , neutron star spin periods ) to classical persistent hmxbs hosting supergiant stars , except for their extremely variable x  ray behaviour ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . their bright x ",
    "ray flares are typically sporadic and rare , occurring with a very low duty cycle which ranges from 0.01% to 5% at most @xcite . the time - averaged x  ray luminosity is below 10@xmath6  erg  s@xmath4 @xcite .    although some sfxts with measured orbital periods show outbursts more frequently near periastron , the occurrence of an sfxt flare in most cases can not be predicted .",
    "the exception is , which is the only source of the class that undergoes outbursts periodically @xcite , every @xmath0165 days @xcite .",
    "this periodicity is interpreted as due to the orbital period of the system .",
    "@xcite suggested that its clocked and brief outbursts are produced by enhanced accretion when the neutron star of the system crosses the focussed outflowing wind along a plane inclined with respect to the orbit near periastron passage .",
    "its optical counterpart , hd  306414 , is a b0.5  ia star , located at a distance @xmath7kpc @xcite .",

    ", we report on an  observation coordinated with  of  performed in february 2016 , aimed at investigating the broad - band spectrum searching for cyclotron absorption lines , to directly measure the neutron star magnetic field , and disentangle between competing models proposed to explain the x - ray behaviour of sfxts . a monitoring with  allowed us to place these observations within the context of the whole outburst .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    the  @xmath10 @xcite carries three x  ray telescopes , each with an european photon imaging camera ( epic ; 0.4 - 12 kev ) at the focus : two with mos ccds @xcite and one with a pn ccd @xcite .",

    "all epic cameras were operated in small window mode and adopted the medium filter .",
    "we reduced the data using version 15.0.0 of the science analysis software ( sas ) with standard procedures and the most updated calibration files .",
    "we used the _ heasoft _ version 6.18 to perform the data analysis .    at first",
    ", we extracted epic source counts from circular regions of 30  radius , adopting pattern selection from 0 to 4 in the pn and from 0 to 12 in mos spectra .",
    "we evaluated the possible presence of pile - up in epic data with _",
    "epatplot _ , finding moderate pile - up only in mos data .",
    "this suggested to excise the core of the psf in both mos data , extracting mos1 and mos2 spectra from annular regions with inner radius of 5and an outer radius of 30 .",
    "background spectra were obtained from similar sized regions offset from the source positions . the full exposure time was exploited and no further filtering was applied to the data .    the sas task _ rgsproc _ was used to extract the rgs1 and rgs2 spectra , which were later combined into one single grating spectrum using _ rgscombine _ present in the sas .",
    "appropriate response matrices were generated using the sas tasks _ arfgen _ and _ rmfgen_. epic spectra were analysed in the energy range 0.4 - 12 , while the rgss , which operated in spectroscopy mode @xcite , were analysed in the range 0.4 - 2.1  kev .    to ensure applicability of the  statistics ,",
    "the spectra were rebinned such that at least 20 counts per bin were present .",
    "free relative normalizations between the spectra were included to account for uncertainties in instrumental responses , always fixing at 1 the normalization of the epic pn spectrum .",
    "spectral uncertainties are given at 90% confidence for one interesting parameter .",
    "in the spectral fitting we used the photoelectric absorption model tbabs in xspec adopting the interstellar abundances of @xcite and photoelectric absorption cross - sections by @xcite .",
    "the final , time - averaged , source net count rates were the following : 5.67@xmath11 counts  s@xmath4 ( epic pn ) , 1.143@xmath12 counts  s@xmath4 ( mos1 , psf core excised ) , 1.130@xmath12 counts  s@xmath4 ( mos2 , psf core excised ) , 0.027@xmath13 counts  s@xmath4 ( combined rgs1 and rgs2 1st order spectra ) .    the high absorption towards the source ( column density , n@xmath14 , around 10@xmath15  @xmath16 ) implied significant detection in the rgss only above 1 kev .",

    "the intensity variability is large , in excess of one order of magnitude .",
    "the uninterrupted  light curve clearly shows that each satellite gap in the nustar observation is actually filled by bright flares , repeating on a timescale of 2 - 2.5  ks .",
    "we performed timing analysis on epic ( all three cameras , 2 - 12 kev ) and  data ( fpma and fpmb , 3 - 78 kev ) after correcting arrival times to the solar system barycenter , applying epoch folding techniques @xcite to measure the known neutron star spin period .",

    "[ fig : spinprofiles ] we show the pulse profiles extracted from the strictly simultaneous  and  data , in different energy ranges , together with four hardness ratios .",
    "the pulse profile is energy dependent , being dominated by an asymmetric main peak below 12 kev , which becomes symmetric at harder energies .",
    "the hardness ratios display different behavior along the pulse phase , as show in the lower panels in fig.[fig : spinprofiles ] .",
    "the pulsed fraction , pf , calculated as , where f@xmath25 and f@xmath26 are the count rates at the maximum and at the minimum of the pulse profile , respectively , increases with energy , from @xmath27  % ( 0.4 - 3 kev ) to @xmath28  % ( 20 - 78 kev ) . over the whole  energy band pf=@xmath29  % ( 0.4 - 12 kev ) , while pf=@xmath30  % over the whole  band ( 3 - 78 kev ) .

    "whatever choice of hardness ratio ( in both  and  data ) , some level of scatter around a mean value was always present , but with no clear trend suggesting a specific and meaningful hardness - ratio - selected spectroscopy .",
    "the only exception was in case of the hardness ratio of 4 - 12 kev to 1 - 4 kev count rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hrsel ] ) : a hard peak lasting @xmath0500  s in the hardness ratio was found after 10@xmath31  s from the start of the  observation .",

    "adopting more complicated models ( like model  1 and model  2 ) is meaningless , since several spectral parameters are unconstrained .",

    "( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the x  ray light curve showed several bright flares with a dynamic range of one order of magnitude during the outburst .",
    "the x  ray pulsar did not show evidence for spin period derivatives with respect to previous observations performed a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the rotational modulation is detected for the first time also at hard energies with , with an energy - dependent spin profile , evolving from an asymmetric main peak dominating at softer energies , to a single more symmetric peak at hard energies above @xmath012  kev .",
    "the source spectrum could be investigated for the first time simultaneously from 0.4 to 78 kev .",
    "it showed a complex structure that could not be described by a single absorbed power law , with a soft excess together with a cutoff at high energies .",
    "different spectral models were investigated , obtaining a good fit with a phenomenological double - component continuum composed by a blackbody together with a plcut model ( model 1 ) .",
    "this description is typically adopted in the x  ray spectroscopy of highly magnetized accreting pulsars @xcite , where the power law is due to comptonization in the accretion column and the blackbody could have different origins ( see below ) .",
    "we also explored an alternative deconvolution of the spectrum ( a single - component model composed by a plcut ) , where the structures in the residuals at softer energies were accounted for by a partially covering absorption model , instead of a blackbody .",
    "this second model ( model 2 ) resulted into an equivalently good description of the spectrum and it is worth reporting , since it is also adopted in the literature when investigating spectra from hmxb pulsars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a narrow emission line is present in the time - averaged spectrum at an energy of 6.44 kev ( consistent with fluorescent emission from almost neutral iron ) and a low equivalent width of 40 ev . during other spectral selections ,",
    "the faint emission line is not clearly visible , although it is still consistent with being there with a similar flux .",
    "fe lines with similar properties are normally found in the x - ray spectra of hmxb pulsars and are interpreted as produced by fluorescent emission in the wind of the supergiant donor illuminated by the x  ray pulsar @xcite .    in both models ,",
    "the plcut continuum resulted in a flat slope ( with a harder photon index in model 1 than in model 2 ) , and in energies of the cutoff that are in agreement with what found in other x  ray pulsars spectra @xcite .",
    "the blackbody emission in model 1 resulted in a hot temperature of 1.6 kev from a small area of 460 meters ( at a distance of 7 kpc ) .",
    "such soft excesses have been discovered in different types of accreting pulsars ( see @xcite for a review ) , with two different properties : hot temperatures ( 1 - 2 kev ) with small emission radii of a few hundred meters , versus colder blackbodies ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) with a much larger emitting radius ( r@xmath39@xmath0100 km ) .",
    "the blackbody component in  is consistent with what found in low luminosity accreting pulsars ( l@xmath38@xmath010@xmath6 - 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 ) , where the hot and small blackbody is thought to be emitted from the polar cap of the accreting pulsar @xcite .    comparing the x - ray flare spectra",
    ", we rely on the broad - band  and  simultaneous spectroscopy ( table  [ tab : simflares ] ) . in this case , only model 1 provided evidence of variability in the spectral parameters with flux , where harder slopes are found during brighter flare peaks ( the faintest flare n.7 shows a significantly steeper power law ) , again in agreement with what usually found in hmxb pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) . on the other hand , a similar trend in not present when using model 2 , where all parameters are consistent with being constant within the 90% uncertainties .",
    "when compared with the spectrum extracted from the low intensity region of the light curve , only model 1 resulted in softer spectral parameters when the source is fainter ( as usually observed in hmxb pulsars and sfxts ) .",
    "the absorption column density resulting from both models is always in excess of the total galactic ( 8@xmath1710@xmath40  @xmath16 , @xcite ) , consistent with local absorbing material , explained by the supergiant outflowing wind . in model  2 ,",
    "the power law continuum is partially covered ( around 50% ) by an additional local absorbing column density .",
    "the physical meaning of a partial covering absorption might be ascribed to the clumpiness of the circumsource material , where the partial absorbers could be due to blobs in the donor wind .",
    "a denser wind clump passing in front of the x - ray source could also explain the hard dip lasting about 500  s caught during the uninterrupted  observation .    during the spectroscopy of single flare peaks , we found a hint of an absorption feature at 17 kev that , if described with a cyclotron absorption model , resulted in a line significance of 2.63  @xmath41 ( including trials ) derived by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "given the low significance , the presence of this line can not be claimed and needs further confirmation .",
    "however , we note that if real , it is variable , since it is present neither in the time - averaged spectrum nor in the spin - phase selected spectroscopy",
    ". this might resemble the behavior in another sfxt , igrj17544 - 2619 , where a temporary cyclotron line was found .",
    "the cyclotron line at 16.8 kev discovered in  data by @xcite , was not confirmed by @xcite during another  observation at a similar source flux .",
    "after ten years since sfxts discovery , a huge progress has been made in understanding their behaviour .    at first",
    ", it was proposed that bondi - hoyle direct accretion from dense clumps in the supergiant wind could explain the sporadic flaring activity in sfxts @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the clump properties implied by the sfxt x  ray light curves with what predicted by the theory of line - driven hot stellar winds indicate that direct bondi - hoyle accretion from clumpy winds can not reproduce the x - ray data ( see @xcite and references therein for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "one of the difficulties of the clumpy wind scenario is that the accreted mass derived from the sfxt x  ray flares ( 10@xmath42 - 10@xmath15  g ) is typically larger than what expected from a single clump in stellar winds ( @xmath010@xmath43  g ) .",
    "the  flare peak luminosity implies an accreted mass of @xmath010@xmath42  g onto the ns , confirming once more this discrepancy .",
    "note that this mass should be considered as a lower limit to the clump mass , since a wind blob , if it is larger than the accretion radius , might be only partially accreted by the pulsar .",
    "currently , two physical mechanisms might explain the sfxt flares in a 187  s pulsar like : either a centrifugal barrier @xcite ) , or a quasi - spherical settling accretion regime @xcite .",
    "in the first case , rescaling the @xcite equations to ( spin period of 187 s and orbital period of 165 days ) we derived a magnetic field of 1.2@xmath1710@xmath44  g needed to have an operating centrifugal barrier ( although we note that the equations reported by @xcite assume a circular orbit ) .",
    "if we adopt the average outburst x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 instead of the wind parameters in this scenario , we found an even higher estimate for the magnetic field of @xmath05@xmath1710@xmath44  g needed for the centrifugal barrier to operate .",
    "note that also the source distance of 7 kpc is not accurate , but it should be considered as a lower limit @xcite . in the second case , the settling accretion scenario sets in in slow pulsars ( spin period @xmath870 s ) when the x  ray luminosity is below 4@xmath1710@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 @xcite . below this threshold",
    "the matter captured inside the bondi radius is not able to efficiently cool down by compton processes , so that it can not penetrate the ns magnetosphere by means of rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "hot matter accumulates above the ns magnetosphere forming a quasi - static shell that cools down only by inefficient radiative cooling .",
    "@xcite proposed that the bright sfxt flares are produced by the collapse onto the ns of this hot shell , triggered by reconnection events between the magnetic field carried by the accreting matter and the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "quasi - periodic flaring activity that has often been observed to punctuate the sfxt outbursts ( e.g. sax  j1818.6 - 1703 , @xcite ) , would be produced when the shell , after a collapse , is replenished by new wind capture , so the flares repeat on a regular timescale , as long as the mass accretion into the magnetosphere is allowed .",
    "the energy normally released in an sfxt bright flare ( @xmath010@xmath45  erg ) is in agreement with estimated mass of the hot shell @xcite , that is also consistent with the accreted mass we have derived here from the luminosity of the flares in  ( @xmath010@xmath42  g )    our  and  observations of  allowed us also to observe , for the first time in this source , x - ray flares repeating every @xmath02 - 2.5 ks , a property that in the settling accretion scenario is explained in a natural way .",
    "note that the  x  ray luminosity during outburst is fully compatible with the luminosity threshold predicted by @xcite for the onset of the settling accretion .",
    "all these observational facts strongly favour an interpretation of the  sfxt properties within the quasi - spherical settling accretion model .",
    "finally , we note that if the hint of a cyclotron line at 17 kev will be confirmed by future observations ( implying a ns surface magnetic field of 2@xmath1710@xmath46  g ) , it will reinforce the interpretation of the sfxt behavior within the settling accretion scenario .",
    "we have performed for the first time a temporal and spectral analysis of the sfxt pulsar   simultaneously in the broad - band 0.4 - 78 kev . indeed , the broadest x  ray energy band previously available for this source was the 550  kev range , thanks to  observations @xcite .",
    "the spin period ( 187.0  @xmath1  s ) did not show evidence for variability with respect to previous observations .",
    "pulsations were detected for the first time above 12 kev , showing an energy dependent spin profile .",
    "the broad - band spectra was successfully deconvolved adopting a double - component model made of a power law with a high energy cutoff together with a hot blackbody , which we interpret as emission from the polar caps of the ns . alternatively",
    ", a partial covering model replacing the blackbody component resulted into an equally good description of the data .",
    "the source light curve showed several bright flares spanning one order of magnitude in intensity , reaching 2@xmath47  erg  s@xmath4 at peak .",
    "the x  ray luminosity in outburst , together with the quasi - periodicity in the flaring activity caught during the uninterrupted  observation , favour a quasi - spherical settling accretion model as the physical mechanism explaining the sfxt behavior , although alternative possibilities ( e.g. centrifugal barrier ) can not be ruled out .",
