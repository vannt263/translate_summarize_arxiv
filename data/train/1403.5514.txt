    "the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) in 1981 by binnig and rohrer in ibm zrich is a milestone of microscopy@xcite .",
    "stm is based on two simple ideas : that electronic vacuum tunneling current depends exponentially on the distance between tip and sample , and that the position of a tip on top of a flat surface can be controlled with subatomic resolution using piezoelectrics@xcite . when operated at cryogenic temperatures , thermal motion of atoms",
    "is reduced or blocked , resolution in energy is improved , and sampled electronic systems show interesting coherent quantum condensate or insulating behaviors . to use stm at low temperatures , it is important that piezoelectrics retain a sizeable motion when cooling .",
    "this was not so obvious during the first days of stm @xcite .",
    "now it is clear that , although piezos reduce their range of motion at low temperatures , they are still useful .",
    "past decades have seen an increasing number of stm experiments at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the field of superconductivity is particularly interesting for stm , because the superconducting gap provides a clear - cut property which can be observed and traced as a function of the position .",
    "of course , the pioneering stm groups realized this point and made first spectroscopic measurements in conventional low t@xmath2 and in cuprate high t@xmath2 superconductors rather early@xcite .",
    "however , it was not until the observation of the vortex lattice with beautiful detail in bell labs in the early 90 s that the possibilities of this technique for superconductivity became clear@xcite .",

    "abrikosov found that ginzburg - landau equations for superconductors under a magnetic field slightly above the lower critical field have periodic solutions if the ginzburg - landau parameter exceeds a certain value@xcite .",
    "another prestigious soviet physicist ( v.v .",
    "schmidt ) writes about this discovery : _ _ here we come across a rare case in which the development of an extensive branch of the physics of superconductors was initiated by a single theoretical development__@xcite .",
    "abrikosov succesfully compared in his seminal work his predictions to a previous experiment , made far earlier by shubnikov in 1936@xcite .",
    "the experiment of shubnikov is the actual breaking ground for applications , because it shows that type ii superconductors can carry a supercurrent at high magnetic fields .",
    "this lifted the early deception of kamerlingh onnes , who pioneeringly suggested high fields as the main application of superconductors@xcite .",
    "he could not realize his dream because he was studying most simple elemental pb and other type i materials , which lose superconductivity at very low magnetic fields@xcite .",

    "thus , the magnetic field profile extends far above the vortex core . in many strongly type ii superconductors ,",
    "the scale of the magnetic field variation is several orders of magnitude larger than the actual core .",
    "most experiments image vortices using the magnetic field profile . when increasing the magnetic field in type ii superconductors , the spatial variation of the magnetic field is smaller than the spatial variation of the superconducting density of states in the core .",
    "stm ( schematically shown in the figure by the red tip and the x - y scanning mechanism ) probes the vortex core by measuring the spatial variation of the electronic density of states .",

    "nanostructuring allows applications in photonics @xcite and the coexistence with ferromagnetic order unveils vortices in spin - triplet systems , with parallels to helium 3 @xcite .     -2",
    "cm    the observation of isolated vortices was pioneered by essman and truble in 1967@xcite .",
    "they used decoration of surfaces of different superconductors with small magnetic particles at low temperatures and under an applied magnetic field ( fig .",

    ", they observe `` elastic '' and `` plastic '' distortions of the vortex lattice in images made at 500 g. because they work at low magnetic fields , they observe vortex free areas together with distorted lattices .",
    "they find dislocations , stacking faults , defects and holes in the vortex lattice , and point out that it interacts strongly with the crystalline defects of the sample .",
    "vortex lattices are a property of the type ii superconductor , and as such they appear in all kinds of samples , from single crystals without defects to amorphous materials .",
    "the interaction of the vortex lattice with the crystalline lattice , defects , dopants or sample geometry modifies vortex positions and creates pinning . understanding pinning is fundamental to create functional devices with superconductors .",
    "decoration experiments have given insight into the behavior of the vortex lattice at low magnetic fields@xcite .",

    "the application of stm to superconductivity has been reviewed in several excellent papers@xcite , focusing on the cuprates and the pnictides respectively .",
    "the aim of the present review is to discuss vortex observation with stm , in particular results found in a few single crystaline systems and in thin films . we focus here on materials where vortex observation is particularly enlightening regarding the features of vortex cores and the collective behavior of the whole lattice",
    "the tunneling experiment between two metallic atomically sharp tips is rather complicated to understand in detail , because it requires solving quantum transport phenomena at atomic level . to discuss this problem ,",
    "let us start by discussing the electrical conduction through a wire of a simple metal with a constriction ( fig .",
    "4a ) . if the constriction is smaller than the electron mean free path , the conduction through such a system is ballistic , and follows sharvin s conductance formula@xcite :    @xmath3    with @xmath4 the conductance , @xmath5 electron charge , @xmath6 planck s constant , @xmath7 fermi wavevector and @xmath8 the radius of the contact . when the wire is pulled , the contact becomes smaller and smaller , until it reaches atomic size ( fig .",
    "then , quantum effects dominate conduction .",
    "the conduction can be described using landauer s formula and the concept of conduction channels , each one with a given transparency @xmath9 .",
    "the amount of channels available in a single atom point contact and their transparency can be related to the electronic structure of the atom or molecule making up the contact@xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is of order one for metallic elements , such as gold , lead or aluminum@xcite .",
    "the conductance is written as    @xmath10    conductance vs. distance curves give well - defined steps at @xmath11 in case of a monovalent simple metal as au ( fig .",
    "5 ) , and structured features which can be related to the atomic orbitals ( fig .",
    "4b ) in case of more complex metals as al , pb or nb@xcite .    when the wire is broken into two pieces , the conduction process is no longer determined by the single contacting atom or molecule , but by the outermost coupling between electronic wavefunctions of the two parts ( fig .",
    "the effect on each other is nearly perturbative , resulting in an exponential dependence of the current with respect to the distance between both atoms at the apex@xcite .",
    "the transparency of the junction is thus small , and it seems reasonable to assume that only one channel contributes to the conduction process .",
    "bardeen s transfer hamiltonian formalism can be used to calculate the resulting conductance , which depends on the way the outermost atom s wavefunctions couple to each other@xcite .",
    "an stm tip can be viewed as one part of such a sharp broken wire which is moved on top of the flat surface of a sample ( fig .",
    "the junction is then made between two different materials , and the conduction properties are determined by the interaction of the last few atoms of the tip with the surface .",
    "-2.5 cm    the measured tunneling current depends thus on the way outermost tip atom couples to sample s wavefunctions at each position ( fig .",
    "4d ) . using bardeen s transfer",
    "hamiltonian formalism , tersoff and hamann found , assuming s - wavefunctions , that the current is proportional to the sample local density of states at the position of the tip@xcite , provided the bias voltage is very close to zero .",

    "@xmath17 in many surfaces of simple metals close to the fermi level .",
    "thus , for measurements made at low bias voltages , @xmath18 can be taken out of the integral .",
    "it has been shown that localized states formed at the junction can be neglected@xcite , as well as the energy dependence of @xmath16 .",
    "then , the conductance is proportional to the sample s density of states@xcite , convoluted by the derivative of the fermi function :    @xmath19    until now , except in a few cases which we detail below , nearly all authors working on vortex observation in superconductors with stm base the interpretation of their data on this model .",
    "the model holds often when stuyding low energy phenomena .",
    "however , it gives a simplified account of the tunneling experiment .",
    "we believe that future vortex observation will take advantage of the full information that one can obtain using tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , we give an extensive account of other tunneling spectroscopy methods and discuss briefly the first experiments where these have been used .    sometimes , broken wires of au are used to make normal tips .",
    "the mechanical annealing method described in @xcite leads to sharp au pyramids which are useful for scanning topography and spectroscopy .",
    "there are of course many other methods to obtain suitable stm tips .",
    "popular tips are of w or pt - ir , which are relatively hard materials that can be shaped using field emission . these methods are well described in literature@xcite .     in units of @xmath20 ) as a function of the tip s displacement when entering and leaving the few atom point contact regime in au .",
    "possible atomic arrangements are shown in schematically at the right of the figure .",
    "contacts larger than the single atom case give sharvin s resistance , see ref.@xcite , and are needed to fabricate long and sharp tips for tunneling.,title=\"fig : \" ] -2",
    "cm      superconducting tips can be obtained by breaking wires of al or pb and mechanically annealing them as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "other methods use evaporation of pb on w or pt - ir tips or a small superconducting single crystal attached to the tip apex@xcite .",
    "when the tip is superconducting with a critical temperature t@xmath2 of the same order as sample s t@xmath2 , the energy dependence of its density of states @xmath18 can not be neglected , and one has to use equ.3 .",
    "@xmath21 is not proportional to @xmath22 , and the fermi function does not enter as a smearing parameter . if @xmath23 is just the bardeen cooper schrieffer ( bcs@xcite ) density of states with a gap of the same order but smaller than the sample s gap @xmath24 , then the current will be zero for @xmath25 , except for thermally excited quasiparticles .",
    "exactly at @xmath26 , and at a finite temperature , the current peaks due to the quasiparticle peak of the tip s density of states . for @xmath27 , the current decreases ,",
    "and then it increases abruptly at @xmath28 .",
    "the size of the corresponding jump in current decreases when increasing temperature , but the conductance remains practically divergent at @xmath29 .",
    "the in - gap conductance shows accordingly a temperature induced exponential increase for @xmath30 , a peak - dip structure , with negative conductance for @xmath31 and a sharp , roughly temperature independent , peak at @xmath32 .",
    "these features are reviewed in several books and papers@xcite .",
    "the effect on the tunneling current of the quasiparticle peak of the superconducting tip is close to the effect obtained by substituting @xmath23 with a @xmath33 function located at the gap edge of the tip . with a @xmath33 function like tip density of states ,",
    "the current traces the density of states of the sample .",
    "temperature induced smearing is absent , as long as the @xmath33 function divergence remains@xcite .",
    "a superconducting tip is similar to such a tip , in that the quasiparticle peak at the gap edge is usually high and narrow ( the width depends on quasiparticle lifetime and gap anisotropy@xcite ) .",
    "of course , the resulting current is also affected by the quasiparticle continuum above the gap edge , and one obtains the bias voltage dependence discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the increase in resolution in the spectroscopy has been used to obtain results obtain with superconducting tips in refs.@xcite .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite , the reduction of temperature induced smearing was relevant to determine the temperature dependence of the sample s density of states in errh@xmath34b@xmath34 . in 2h - nbse@xmath35",
    ", it was used to determine the peculiar temperature dependence of the multigap structure .",
    "smallest gaps are the most affected by temperature and they close well below @xmath36@xcite .",
    "this result has explained the apparent discrepancy between angular resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and london penetration measurements about the presence or not of a superconducting gap in the small 3d pocket derived form se bands . whereas arpes does not observe gap opening in this band at temperatures very close to @xmath36@xcite , london penetration depth measurements at much lower temperatures",
    "@xcite did show evidence for the presence of a sizeable gap opening in the se band .",
    "furthermore , the spatial variation of the quasiparticle peaks obtained using superconducting tips give a length scale , termed doppler shift length scale , related to the screening currents around vortex cores , and thus more to @xmath0 than to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the increased energy resolution is also useful when it is difficult to achieve very low temperatures@xcite . in single magnetic adatoms and",
    "deposited molecules , superconducting tips have helped to determine local spectroscopic features@xcite .    the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting tip has been explored in refs.@xcite .",
    "most of the tips used are type i superconductors , such as pb or al .",
    "generally , it is found that the pyramidal structure of the tip gives an upper critical field exceeding by several times the bulk critical field of the tip s material@xcite .",
    "if the pyramid is long enough , superconductivity disappears in the bulk and remains at the tip s apex@xcite .",
    "below the superconducting gap the current is not exactly zero , even at zero temperature ( fig .",
    "multiple andreev reflection leads to a finite conductivity .",
    "exactly at zero bias , the josephson current appears .",
    "both transport phenomena require multiple passage of the tunnel barrier , and are thus further exponentially reduced with respect to the single particle tunneling .",
    "nevertheless , these effects have been observed by approaching the tip to the sample and reducing the tunneling barrier to the minimum possible prior to enter into contact@xcite .",
    "both effects have been used to image the vortex lattice , in particular in nbse@xmath35 ( see also section 4.1.2 ) .",
    "andreev reflection spectroscopy has been made at a single location between tips and samples of superconducting materials .",
    "for instance , multiple andreev reflections between electrons in @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands of mgb@xmath35 were observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "andreev current is also observed below the gap in a superconducting tip on top of a normal region of the sample .",
    "andreev spectroscopy imaging has been made in nbse@xmath35 ( see below fig.15 ) and is a new imaging method which is been developed .",
    "it can give information about local andreev conduction behavior , and in particular lead in future to spin sensitive imaging , as the andreev process with a conventional s - wave superconductor at the tip requires spin flip @xcite .",
    "-0 cm    in ref.@xcite , the josephson effect at a single location , and its dependence as a function of the tip - sample distance , was studied in detail .",
    "it was shown that the josephson effect is considerably reduced due to fluctuations with respect to the values in junctions of larger size@xcite .",
    "similarly reduced josephson current is generally present in later stm work using superconducting tips .",
    "vortex lattice observations by mapping josephson signal was made in v@xmath39si using a tip of mgb@xmath35@xcite , and as a function of the position under magnetic fields in a thin film of mgb@xmath35 ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in v@xmath39si , the length scales involved in vortex lattice observation from josephson effect and quasiparticle conductance are very similar .",
    "experiments in nbse@xmath35 , described below , point out that in nbse@xmath35 there may be some relevant differences .",
    "all this work is building up a new spatially dependent spectroscopic mode , scanning josephson spectroscopy@xcite , which can be used to map cooper pair density , instead of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "its further development and application to nanostructures and unconventional superconductors , such as heavy fermions and non - centrosymmetric systems , is to be followed and can provide insight which seems impossible to obtain otherwise .",
    "for example , the josephson coupling between an s - wave tip and a p - wave or d - wave superconductor is strongly position dependent@xcite , and is one of the few direct probes for the occurence of such complex superconducting wavefunctions .",
    "when the sample holds resonant excitations close to the surface , such as adsorbed kondo ions , single particle tunneling does no longer lead to a correct description of the experiment , because the tunneling probability into states with different kinds of electronic wavefunctions is of the same order@xcite .",
    "losely speaking , tunneling into a magnetic ion on a conducting lattice can occur either into the resonant magnetic states , or into the delocalized electron background .",
    "tunneling electrons into the two different channels interfere , producing a fano lineshape which is close to the energy level of the resonant states . if this level is close to the fermi level , it produces asymmetry in the tunneling conductance and the apperance of peaks or dips at energies related to the resonant state s position and width .",
    "the preferential tunneling channel and the nature of the interference determine the form of the fano resonance@xcite .",
    "a tip coupling preferentially to de - localized states gives a flat conductance with a dip at the resonant level due to destructive interference .",
    "a tip coupling to resonant levels gives a sharp peak at the resonant level .",
    "the work of @xcite shows a nice example of the control over the resonant levels and their coupling to the itinerant electronic properties by changing the tip - sample distance .    to our knowledge ,",
    "vortex observations taking into account multiple tunneling have not been made until now .",
    "interesting candidates are vortices in systems showing coulomb blockade ; proximity induced structures with organic compounds having low energy levels @xcite ; or heavy fermions where the kondo energy is of order of the superconducting critical temperature@xcite .",
    "metals show at the surface electronic wave patterns@xcite due to interference effects associated with scattering by defects or steps at the surface .",
    "the properties of the associated charge modulations at the surface can be obtained by fourier transform of the real - space images .",
    "wavevectors are generally incommensurate with the lattice and dispersive . their changes as a function of the bias voltage allow tracing the electron dispersion relation@xcite .",
    "often , a small atomic size effect due to tunneling matrix elements is also found@xcite .",
    "superconductivity is expected to be homogeneous below the coherence length . but atomic size changes of superconducting local density of states can appear if the sample shows anisotropic gap structure . in ref.@xcite , an atomic size modulation in the density of states was found in 2h - nbse@xmath35 .",
    "small changes of the form of the tunneling density of states are detected , depending on the atomic location of the tip .",
    "it was shown that anisotropic and multiband superconducting properties together with an anisotropic tip - sample coupling can explain the atomic size modulation of the superconducting density of states .",
    "this can be used to study the gap anisotropy of the sample .",

    "as discussed above , vortices have been observed yet only in cecoin@xmath62 , with a four - fold core which is related to the gap anisotropy .",
    "there are other systems where magnetism coexists with superconductivity such as erni@xmath35b@xmath35c or tmni@xmath35b@xmath35c@xcite .",
    "the rare earths in these compounds possibly interact through exchange mediated by the superconducting electrons .",
    "atomic resolution , and a structural transition from hexagonal to square lattice was observed in the vortex lattice of tmni@xmath35b@xmath35c@xcite .",
    "gapless superconductivity was observed in erni@xmath35b@xmath35c@xcite .",
    "although these systems are clearly s - wave superconductors , exotic vortex core behavior can appear due to the long range magnetic order coexisting with superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the observation of vortex lattice in nanostructured superconductors has been made at low magnetic fields . at high fields , the vortex density increases and the intervortex interaction weakens@xcite .",
    "the vortex lattice softens and thus jams previously mobile vortex arrangements .",
    "this allows to study the interplay between jamming and nanoscale geometry .",
    "-0 cm    technically , there are two challenges to address .",
    "first , to obtain nanostructures with enough surface quality allowing to tunnel into them .",
    "second , to be able to locate the nanostructures in - situ and navigate across them .",
    "the first challenge has not been solved fully .",
    "tries with nanostructures fabricated using resin based nanofabrication techniques and classical materials such as al , pb or nb have been found to leave traces which make local tunneling difficult .",
    "an experiment aiming at studying small superconducting disks was reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "some success has been obtained by combining stm and atomic force microscopy , the latter used to image and locate the nanostructures@xcite .",
    "however , the tunneling junction is then not a vacuum junction , which makes it difficult to obtain proper imaging conditions .",
    "using deposition of stable materials and resin free nanofabrication allows designing structures with different geometries .",
    "focused ion beam film deposition of superconducting thin films is an interesting route to create nanostructures for stm studies@xcite . in fig .",
    "we show a vortex lattice image taken on a superconducting nanostructure structure . using an in - situ positioning mechanism@xcite ,",
    "we have found an island containing only one single vortex hexagon , which matches perfectly to the size of the island .",
    "proximity junctions were also studied in ref.@xcite , observing the form of the tunneling conductance curves when crossing a n - s interface .",
    "interestingly , authors observe vortices close to the n - s interface , showing that surface barrier for vortex entry is significantly reduced with a n layer in contact to the surface of the superconductor .    in nanostructures , multiquanta vortices can nucleate under appropriate conditions , as well as vortex - antivortex pairs@xcite .",
    "this can significantly alter vortex core shapes . in principle stm",
    "is insensitive to the size and direction of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , it is generally assumed that this technique can not be used to detect these structures .",
    "however theoretical calculations show that the core level andreev structure is sensitive to the phase winding properties around the core@xcite .",
    "thus , core properties are expected to be different in multiquanta vortices and in vortex - antivortex pairs@xcite . to observe these features , nanostructuring of clean crystals with pronounced",
    "zero bias anomalies at the core are needed .",
    "experiments in 2h - nbse@xmath35 and related materials could lead to the observation of vortex - antivortex differences in the andreev core level structure .",
    "nanostructured superconductors are also expected to show interesting effects in vortex arrangements of high density lattices .",
    "recently , a re - entrant superconducting behavior was found using transport measurements when increasing the magnetic field in nanostructures at magnetic fields above a tesla@xcite .",
    "a suppression of the resistance between 4 and 7 orders of magnitude is observed in a wire and in a perforated thin film ( fig .",
    "the resistance remains practically zero over a field range as large as a tesla .",
    "these observations lead to resistance variations which go in the same direction as the ubiquitous peak effect features measured in many systems@xcite .",
    "but the observed size is well above any previous observations of such an effect .",
    "early work in long superconducting bridges @xcite shows that , in some cases , a josephson effect re - appears at magnetic fields much higher than those expected from known material s properties , although still an order of magnitude below the field where re - entrance is reported in ref.@xcite . to explain the re - entrance of josephson features",
    ", authors of refs.@xcite propose that the one dimensional chain of vortices is stable to the action of a magnetic field and a current .",
    "calculations are provided to support this proposal .",
    "the stability enhances superconducting properties , and can be far stronger than pinning effects . in ref.@xcite , the re - entrance of superconductivity",
    "is imposed in nanostructures by the presence of a small amount of confined vortices .",
    "vortex mobility , is reduced by confinement and core merging .",
    "the origin of the new effect is the establishment of dense vortex packings confined by surface superconductivity .",
    "imaging should address this behavior , through patterning of appropriately sized structures in thin films .",
    "the unexpected reduction of the resistance is a result of the effect of geometry and surface properties of the superconductor on vortex transport .",
    "the observations show that vortex confinement can lead to a significant reduction of their motion .",
    "-4 cm    finally , nanostructures arise naturally in single and few layers systems of pb , grown in uhv conditions .",
    "pb grows as nanosized islands with internal voids and a circular structure whose geometry can be chosen among the many different islands which typically appear when imaging large surfaces .",
    "very nice vortex nucleation and confinement experiments have been made in several experiments in these nanostructures @xcite .",
    "vortex confinement in @xcite , for instance , is related to the interplay between vortex nucleation and edge circulating supercurrents .",
    "these extremely small structures are starting an interesting line of studies regarding nanosized vortex nucleation and pinning .",
    "2d superconducting behavior can have anomalous superconducting properties in van der waals materials .",
    "it is an interesting development , which can possibly lead to anomalous vortex features .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is useful to make a few comments about the recent advances in this field .",
    "layered systems have quasi-2d electronic correlations and often show fermi surface tubes with practically small out of plane dispersion@xcite . among these ,",
    "the transition metal dichalcogenides , such as 2h - nbs@xmath35 , 2h - nbse@xmath35 , 2h - tas@xmath35 and 2h - tase@xmath35 , have the advantage that they can be produced in high quality single crystalline form and their surface can be easily prepared through exfoliation .",
    "furthermore , band structure calculations have been made in detail and compared to band dispersion photoemission measurements@xcite .",
    "while the vortex lattice has been measured in 2h - nbs@xmath35 and in 2h - nbse@xmath35 , its properties are still unkown in 2h - tas@xmath35 and 2h - tase@xmath35 , where the layer separation is largest .",
    "their low temperature properties have been shown to be rather peculiar .",
    "2h - tas@xmath35 shows in - plane anisotropic charge patterns which could produce interesting superconducting properties@xcite .",
    "2h - tase@xmath35 is the material of the series which has mostly marked two - dimensional properties .",
    "further materials showing quasi 2d features are the diantimonides , such as lasb@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the observation of vortices has not yet been achieved in the latter three systems ( 2h - tas@xmath35 , 2h - tase@xmath35 and lasb@xmath35 ) , as the areas showing superconducting features are relatively small .    .",
    "at the surface of tase@xmath35 , the se - tase structures ( right panels ) arrange either in prisms or antiprisms , giving a hexagonal a trigonal unit cells .",
    "the coordination of the transition metal atom is trigonal prismatic and octahedral , respectively .",
    "accordingly , electronic properties are strongly modified .",
    "authors find situations with hexagonal layers and large superconducting features ( top panels ) , situations with trigonal layers and no superconductivity at all ( middle panel ) and situations where the layers have a mixed character ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the latter shows the emergence of a remarkable zero bias peak , highlighting anomalous superconducting properties .",
    "the zero bias peak evolves along a 0.2 nm path from a se atom to an intersite , into a shallow dip . adapted from ref.@xcite .",

    "isolated layers consisting of the molecular building blocks of these materials ( e.g. tase@xmath35 ) will open ways to obtain new superconductors . their fabrication has been largely discussed in literature and presents some unsolved challenges , as for instance the increase of the reactivity when approaching few layers@xcite . creating heterostructures which isolate the 2d behavior of single layers or",
    "build up 2d interface electronic properties allows to solve some of those problems .",
    "one way is to exfoliate the material and search for areas with surfaces of markedly different properties .",
    "this was accomplished in ref.@xcite , where authors have been able to find surfaces with single layer superconducting behavior .",
    "t@xmath2 is considerably increased , from 150 mk to 1 k at the surface ( fig .",
    "furthermore , the bulk superconducting gap does not show up .",
    "instead , a strong zero bias anomaly , which is temperature and magnetic field dependent , is observed@xcite .",
    "the way such an anomaly would evolve close to or inside a vortex is an intriguing question which may be addressed in future experiments .",
    "we have reviewed experiments about the observation of the vortex lattice in real space at high magnetic fields .",
    "we have explained the experimental features and advances which have lead to improved resolution in vortex lattice imaging .",
    "we discuss imaging of the vortex core , which can be until now uniquely made using stm , and the collective behavior of the lattice . challenging lines for future",
    "work include imaging zero temperature transitions of the vortex lattice , the vortex liquid at high temperatures and currents , vortex cores in two - dimensional metals and nanostructures , and fermi surface features in vortex cores of unconventional and multiband superconductors .",
