    "together with the adopted @xmath30 and the hcn - to - h@xmath29 conversion factor ( @xmath83 ) of 1.3 @xmath18 10@xmath84 @xmath32 ( k km s@xmath4)@xmath4 @xcite , @xmath80 @xmath15 0.018 corresponds to @xmath81 as low as @xmath17 12 % . in the w - r region , @xmath81 is nearly four times higher than that in the central region ( 46% ) , by using the upper limit of 0.070 on @xmath80 .",
    "the dense gas fraction in the central region of ngc 5430 is lower than that in the circumnuclear regions of other strong - barred galaxies ( @xmath17 50  100% , e.g. , @xcite ) , implying that even though the strong bar is efficiently transporting molecular gas to the center , the majority of the gas does not become dense gas .",
    "the low density gas fraction explains the above - mentioned low sfe of the central region compared with other circumnuclear regions .",
    "according to the relation of hcn luminosity to sfr that was suggested by @xcite , the future sfr formed by this dense gas will be @xmath17 0.4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , comparable to the current sfr in the central region indicated by h@xmath2 .",
    "the future sfr , arising from the dense gas in the w - r region , will be at most 0.15 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , nearly 10 times lower than the current sfr in the w - r region , which is @xmath17 1 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous discussion suggesting that the star formation activity in the w - r region is decaying and will continue to decrease in the future .",
    "we roughly estimate the initial mass ratio of ngc 5430 and its companion based on the observed morphology , velocity , and star formation properties .",
    "major mergers can destroy galaxy disks and produce remnants with properties similar to those of observed giant ellipticals ( but some studies have reported the possibility of formation of a disk galaxy in a major merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we rule out this possibility since the candidate of companion has been suggested to be embedded in ngc 5430 @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass mergers ( 4:1  7:1 ) tend to produce both ellipticals and hybrid systems , which are disk - like galaxies supported by velocity dispersion rather than rotation @xcite .",
    "the value of rotation velocity to velocity dispersion of these hybrid systems ( @xmath85 ) is small , 0 @xmath6 @xmath85 @xmath86 2 @xcite .",
    "the maximum h@xmath2 velocity dispersion of the galaxy is around 70 km s@xmath4 , and the deprojected h@xmath2 rotational velocity in the galactic disk is @xmath17 300 km s@xmath4 ( corrected with an inclination of 32@xmath12 from @xcite ) , resulting to a @xmath85 of @xmath17 4 .",
    "hence , ngc 5430 is strongly rotationally - supported as a regular disk galaxy .",
    "therefore the initial mass ratio between ngc 5430 and its satellite is likely larger than 7:1 .",
    "simulations show that , for a primary galaxy with a stellar mass of ngc 5430 value 5.3 @xmath18 10@xmath19m@xmath3 from the spitzer s@xmath23 g project @xcite . ]",
    ", enhanced star formation only occurs in pairs with mass ratio @xmath6 20:1 @xcite",
    ". therefore the initial mass ratio of ngc 5430 is likely between 7:1  20:1 , and probably around 10:1 to generate a star formation timescale ( inverse of sfe ) of @xmath6 2 gyr at the initial coalescence phase @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we constrain the minor - merging and star formation history of the three - spiral wolf - rayet ( w - r ) galaxy ngc 5430 and its satellite holm 569b embedding in the eastern bar of ngc 5430 .",
    "molecular gas tracers @xmath0co ( 10 ) and @xmath1co ( 10 ) were observed by carma with a resolution of @xmath17 1.3 kpc (  [ sec_obs ] ) .",
    "the observed area is @xmath17 16 kpc .",
    "the main results are (  [ sec_results ] ) :    * @xmath0co ( 10 ) is confidently detected in the central region , entire bar , and an asymmetric spiral arm ( the third spiral ) of ngc 5430 .",
    "solid detections of @xmath1co ( 10 ) show at the central region and the eastern bar with w - r region . *",
    "the molecular bar shows as offset ridges as seen in typical barred galaxies .",
    "the offset ridges of the two sides of the bar are symmetric around the galactic central region , but the eastern bar are stronger in both co lines . *",
    "ngc 5430 has a strong bar suggested by the high central concentration of molecular gas and the high ellipticity of the bar .",
    "* velocity field of @xmath0co ( 10 ) matches the velocity field and the position - velocity diagrams of h@xmath2 , which was observed with higher spatial and velocity resolutions . *",
    "rotation curve of h@xmath2 shows no obvious distortion by galaxies merger .",
    "however , inhomogeneous mass distribution is suggested by a small bump of rotation curve around the w - r region , implying that the merger system has nearly , but not fully , stablized yet .",
    "the outer rotation curve are more asymmetric between the two sides of the galaxy due to either the past interaction with holm 569b or / and ongoing interaction with members in the galaxy group .",
    "* since the minor merger systems kinematicaly stablize after 1  2 gyr after the first encounter , ngc 5430 likely captures holm 569b on this timescale .",
    "physical properties of molecular gas at the central region and the w - r region are inferred by the large velocity gradient calculations ( lvg ) and the line ratios of @xmath0co ( 10)/@xmath1co ( 1 - 0 ) ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath0co ( 21)/@xmath0co ( 10 ) ( @xmath88 ) , and @xmath0co ( 21)/@xmath1co ( 21 ) ( @xmath89 ) (  [ sec_phy_prop_sf ] ) .",
    "the later two ratios are cited from literature .",
    "the ratio of @xmath89 is only available in the central region .",
    "the main results are :    * the line ratios of the central region are @xmath87 @xmath28 10 , @xmath88 @xmath28 0.7 , and @xmath89 @xmath28 12.6 .",
    "the ratios are in the range of starburst regions , but close to boundaries between starburst and the relatively quiescent molecular regions ( e.g. , the galactic disk molecular gas ) .",
    "the ratios of the w - r region are consistent to the galactic disk molecular gas , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 and @xmath17 6 and 0.54 , respectively .",
    "* temperature of the central region derived from the lvg calculations is 10 - 40 k , warmer than the w - r region , which is 10 k. these results imply that the w - r region is small and compact , thus the bulk molecular gas measured by low - resolution observations includes significant amount of low - temperature molecular gas irrelevant to the w - r starburst . in contrast , in spite of a lower degree of star formation , star formation is more spatially extended in the central region , leading to a higher derived temperature . *",
    "gas density is 200  1600 @xmath51 in both regions , consistent to the critical density of co lines .",
    "star formation history is constrained using star formation rates ( sfrs ) that trace different timescales , including infrared ( sfr(ir ) ) for the average of past 100 myr , radio continuum ( sfr(rc ) ) for the past a few times 10 myr , and h@xmath2 ( sfr(h@xmath2 ) ) for the past a few times 1 myr (  [ sec_phy_prop_sf ] ) .",
    "the main results are :    * the observed global sfr(ir ) , sfr(rc ) and sfr(h@xmath2 ) are @xmath17 8 , 10 , and 2.4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the observed sfr(rc ) might be an lower limit due to the mass loss of massive stars .",
    "the _ real _",
    "sfr(rc ) is probably as high as @xmath17 35 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "these sfrs suggest that there is an instantaneous starburst around a few times 10 myr ago . together with the previous stellar synthesis study of the w - r region and the theoretical model of w - r starburst",
    ", we suggest that the starburst started around 5.3  10 myr ago , likely triggered by the collision of the satellite . *",
    "we found that the current star formation efficiency of the central region of ngc 5430 is low compared to other galaxies .",
    "moreover , the current dense gas fraction of the central region inferred by the ratio of hcn/@xmath0co ( 10 ) is also low , implying a low sfr in the future as well . * current sfe of the w - r region is 10 times higher than the central region . however , sfr of the w - r region is rapidly decreasing by more than 10 times from the collision time to the present time .",
    "the future sfr implied by the amout of dense gas suggests that the sfr of the w - r region will continue to decrease .",
    "finally we note that theoretical simulation is still necessary to constrain the merger history of ngc 5430 system .",
    "each systems may have unique satellite orbits that would significantly affect their current morphology and star formation activity .",
    "models of ngc 5430 and the direct comparison of the multi - wavelength observations will yield important constraints to the this system .",
    "future high resolution hi observations would be valuable to reveal large scale dynamic structures beyond the molecular and stellar disk and provide a knowledge of the possible interaction orbits .",
    "wide - field co observations are also indispensable to reveal the gas distribution and gas supply to star formation in detail , as well as the possible influence of galaxies collisions towards the central region , e.g , the asymmetric sfe at the contact point of the circumnuclear ring .",

    "<S> we used multi - wavelength analysis of the newly observed molecular gas ( @xmath0co and @xmath1co ( 1-0 ) ) with interferometer carma and archival star formation tracers to constrain the interaction , merging , and star formation history of an off - center minor merger , a three - spiral barred galaxy ngc 5430 and its satellite embedded in the bar . </S>",
    "<S> morphology of the molecular gas in the bar of ngc 5430 shows minimal signs of recent interactions in our resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent morphological remnant of the past galaxy interaction is an asymmetric spiral arm , containing more molecular gas and exhibiting higher star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density than the two primary arms . </S>",
    "<S> rotation curve analysis suggests that ngc 5430 and its satellite collided several gyr ago . </S>",
    "<S> history of star formation was constrained by using sfrs that trace different timescales ( infrared , radio continuum , and h@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the collision occurred 5  10 myr ago , triggering a transient off - center starburst of wolf - rayet stars at the eastern bar end . in the past , </S>",
    "<S> the global sfr during the wolf - rayet starburst peaked at 35 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 . at present , the merger - driven starburst is rapidly decaying and the current global sfr has decreased to the galactic value . the sfr will continue to decay as suggested by the present amount of dense gas ( traced by hcn ( 1-0 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the global sfr is still dominated by the wolf - rayet region rather than the circumnuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> compared with other barred galaxies , the circumnuclear region exhibits particularly low dense gas fraction , low star formation activity and high concentration of gas . </S>",
    "<S> physical properties of the molecular gas are inferred by using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the initial mass ratio of the ngc 5430 and its satellite are suggested to be in the intermediate ratio range of 7:1 - 20:1 . </S>"
