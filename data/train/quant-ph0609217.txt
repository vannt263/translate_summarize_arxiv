    "entanglement plays an essential role in the ideas of quantum information , like quantum computation , quantum communication , quantum cryptography , and so on @xcite .",
    "efficient generation of entanglement hence constitutes an essential element for the realization of such ideas , and various schemes have been proposed .",
    "entanglement would be most simply and naturally generated by a direct interaction between two entities carrying quantum information @xcite , i.e.  between two qubits .",
    "there are , however , several setups in which the two qubits are separated from each other , beyond the range of the direct interaction , but an entanglement is to be shared between them . in such a case ,",
    "a `` mediator '' would be convenient to entangle the separated qubits , and several schemes have been investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    among these proposals ,",
    "we here concentrate ourselves on a scheme based on the `` successive '' interactions of a mediator with two qubits to be entangled @xcite .",
    "mediator x prepared in a specific state is sent to interact successively one by one with qubits a and b , each of which is prepared in an appropriate initial state , and then the state of x is measured .",
    "if x is found in a specific state after the interactions , we end up with an entanglement between a and b.    it has been somewhat standard in such schemes to assume that mediator x interacts with qubit a(b ) for a certain time duration @xmath0 @xcite , and the generation of a highly entangled state with a high probability is accomplished by tuning these times , given the coupling constants .",
    "it is , however , a subtle problem whether the notion of the `` interaction time '' makes sense or not",
    ". it might be valid when the size of a wave packet is small enough compared with the interaction region , but it might not be otherwise . even in the former case",
    ", no rigorous proof has been given explicitly so far , to the best of the present authors knowledge .",
    "a rigorous approach to this issue would be to formulate it as a _ scattering problem _ and such attempts have recently appeared @xcite . qubits a and b are shown to be entangled after _ scattering _",
    "mediator x. in this approach , the notion of the interaction time is not necessary ; actually , such a time is either absent in the stationary - state treatments or automatically given by the physical situation under consideration in the wave - packet scatterings @xcite . at this point , it is worth noting that x can be reflected by each of the qubits with a certain probability .",
    "this effect is not taken into account in the standard formulations with the interaction times . the wave reflected by b",
    "is partially directed to a and some of its portion is reflected back to b. such a sequence of bounces between a and b gives rise to a resonant scattering of mediator x.    the purpose of the present work is to clarify the effects of the 1d resonant scattering on the entanglement generation @xcite : resonance can enhance the degree of entanglement .",
    "it is revealed that the distance @xmath1 between the two qubits is an important parameter to gain an entanglement efficiently , and maximally entangled states are available with finite probabilities by adjusting @xmath1 or the incident momentum @xmath2 of x , in a wide parameter region of the coupling constants .",
    "fine tunings of @xmath2 or @xmath1 , however , are not necessarily required and robust generation of highly entangled states is possible .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian in 1d space : @xmath3 qubits a and b are placed at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and the quantum information is encoded in their spin states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are flipped by the ladder operators @xmath8 .",
    "a and b are initially prepared in @xmath9 and mediator x polarized in @xmath10 is injected from the left .",
    "x , whose position and momentum are represented by the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , propagates according to the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) and is scattered by a and b ( fig .  [ fig : entgenscat ] ) . since the interactions between mediator x and qubits a , b preserve the number of spins in the up state @xmath13 among a , b , and x , if x after the scattering is detected by either of the two detectors on both sides and found in @xmath14 , either state of a or b is flipped down and an entangled state is generated [ see ( [ eqn : entstat ] ) below ] . note that we are looking at an extreme case where the potential barriers are much thinner than the extension of the wave packet of x.     is scattered by qubits a and b placed at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and initialized in @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is to be detected by either of the two detectors on both sides , with a certain probability.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    let us find a scattering state of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath15 which would describe the scattering of a well - monochromatized incident particle x. we introduce the wave functions @xmath16 the solution is given in the form @xmath17 for each spin state , where @xmath2 is the momentum ( apart from @xmath18 ) of x and @xmath19 .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement generation from the initialized state @xmath9 by injecting x in the spin state @xmath10 .",
    "in such a case , only the three wave functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are involved in the problem .",

    "_ when we concentrate ourselves on a transmitted particle _",
    "( like in the approach with the interaction time ) , a state of x and a , e.g.  @xmath33 , is `` rotated '' after the transmission of x through potential a like @xmath34 apart from the normalization .",
    "the counterpart in the approach with the interaction time reads @xcite @xmath35 and there exists the connection between the two formulations : @xmath36 these relations show that @xmath37 ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and a higher / lower momentum corresponds to a shorter / longer interaction time .    in practice , however , one should also take account of the probability for such event , transmission , to occur . to achive the complete flip @xmath40 , for instance , the correspondence ( [ eqn : correspondence ] )",
