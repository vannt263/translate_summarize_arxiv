    "it has been known that there exists notable discrepancy between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted values of the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the brookhaven e821 experiment @xcite reported , for @xmath7 , @xmath8 there are several theoretical estimates of the standard - model ( sm ) value of the muon @xmath6 . based on the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the hadronic vacuum polarization , the predictions are @xmath9 where we take account of the five - loop qed calculation @xcite and the latest update of the electroweak contribution @xcite .",
    "thus , the difference is estimated as @xmath10 hence , there exists more than @xmath11-@xmath12 discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values .",
    "we call this discrepancy as `` muon @xmath6 anomaly . ''",
    "the origin of the muon @xmath6 anomaly is yet unknown .",
    "if low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) exists , the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 , denoted as @xmath13 , can be sizable .",
    "in particular , when @xmath14 , which is a ratio of the vacuum expectation values of up- and down - type higgses , is relatively large , @xmath13 can be easily as large as @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the muon @xmath6 anomaly originates in the susy contribution .",
    "the primary purpose of this letter is to point out that we may have a chance to test this possibility by reconstructing @xmath13 , if superparticles are found in future collider experiments , and if their properties are determined .    at the leading order , the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6",
    "is composed of smuon  neutralino and sneutrino  chargino loop diagrams . in order to reconstruct @xmath13 ,",
    "it is necessary to understand properties of sleptons , in particular , those of smuons .",
    "unfortunately , they may not be well studied at lhc . on the contrary ,",
    "once the international @xmath16 linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite is built , it is possible to determine them precisely as long as the superparticles are within the kinematical reach .    in this letter",
    ", we raise a question how and how accurately the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 can be reconstructed by using ilc measurements of the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we assume that the muon @xmath6 anomaly is due to the susy contribution . since the contribution depends on mssm parameters , we concentrate on a particular case where it is dominated by so - called bino diagram .",
    "such a setup is especially interesting , because sleptons are expected to be within the kinematical reach of ilc @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath13 can be reconstructed with the accuracy of @xmath0 for the sample point we adopt , once ilc runs at the center - of - mass energy @xmath17 and accumulates the integrated luminosity @xmath18 .",
    "let us first summarize the framework of the analysis .",
    "the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 strongly depends on mssm parameters . in this letter , we concentrate on the case where it is dominated by so - called bino diagram .",
    "this situation is realized if the wino and higgsino mass parameters are much larger than the bino mass parameter . in this limit",
    ", the leading contribution is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 in the expression , @xmath20 is the bino mass parameter , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the @xmath23-th lightest smuon mass , and @xmath24 is the gauge coupling constant for u(1)@xmath25 , which comes from the bino(s)muons interactions . also , @xmath26 is the left - right mixing parameter in the smuon mass matrix .",
    "the loop function @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28.\\ ] ] it is notable that @xmath29 can be as large as @xmath30 especially when the higgsinos are heavy , since @xmath31 is enhanced when @xmath32 is large , where @xmath33 is the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "in contrast , the other contributions to the muon @xmath6 , including those from the second - lightest or heavier neutralino , are suppressed if the higgsinos are decoupled .",
    "the contribution @xmath34 can be reconstructed if the bino mass , smuon masses , and the left - right mixing parameter @xmath26 are known . as we will see below , they are expected to be determined very accurately at ilc , if the sleptons and the bino - like neutralino are within the kinematical reach . in fact , since the ilc measurements are very precise , the leading approximation given in eq .   may not be accurate enough to be compared with the ilc analyses .",
    "in addition , there is a subtlety in relating the _ gaugino _ coupling constants with the gauge coupling constants in particular when some of the superparticles are relatively heavy @xcite .",
    "thus , we will use more complete formula for @xmath13 .    the full one - loop level formula for @xmath35 consists of the contribution from smuon ",
    "neutralino loop diagrams and sneutrino  chargino diagrams .",
    "the smuon ",
    "neutralino contribution is given by  @xcite @xmath36 f^n_1(x_{ax } )      -\\frac{m_{\\tilde\\chi^0_x}}{3 m_\\mu } n^{\\mu_l}_{ax } n^{\\mu_r}_{ax } f^n_2(x_{ax } )    \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : amuneutralino}\\ ] ] which includes the leading contribution @xmath37 . here , @xmath38",

    "smuon coupling constants .",
    "parameterizing interactions of neutralinos as @xmath44 the coefficients are @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the yukawa coupling constants in the superpotential .",
    "the unitary matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 diagonalize the mass matrices of neutralinos and sleptons , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that soft susy breaking parameters of the sleptons are independent of the generation , and all the complex phases of the susy parameters are negligibly small , in order to avoid too large lepton - flavor violations and electric dipole moments .",
    "then , the slepton masses are obtained from the slepton mass matrix , @xmath49 which is diagonalized by the following unitary matrix , @xmath50 the slepton mixing angle satisfies the relation , @xmath51 this relation will play an important role in the following discussion .",
    "it should be noticed that the coupling constants for the gaugino  lepton ",
    "slepton vertices , or the gaugino coupling constants , deviate from the ordinary gauge coupling constants @xcite . in eqs .   and",
    ", the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are introduced to take account of such an effect . in the susy limit ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are satisfied ( with @xmath24 and @xmath57 being the gauge coupling constants of u(1)@xmath25 and su(2)@xmath58 , respectively ) .",
    "these relations are violated when some superparticles are ( much ) heavier than the sleptons . in the case",
    "where all the superparticles except for sleptons and the bino are heavy , we obtain the following approximate formula for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( cf .  ref .",

    "the differences among @xmath24 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be @xmath65 if @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are larger than @xmath66 .",
    "note that the leading contribution of is proportional to the product @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "since the corrections to the gaugino couplings can be sizable , both of the couplings should be determined directly at ilc .",
    "it is also noted that @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are universal for ( at least ) light generations .",
    ".parameters and mass spectrum and at our sample point .",
    "the masses are in units of gev , and @xmath68 denotes selectrons and smuons . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      now let us discuss the accuracy of the reconstruction of @xmath69 with ilc .",
    "the accuracy is estimated by summing all the errors induced by these parameters in quadrature as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . in table",
    "[ table : accuracy ] , their uncertainties are summarized .",
    "consequently , we estimate @xmath77 as @xmath78 taking @xmath79 .",
    "the dominant error originates in the determination of the left - right mixing parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the reconstructed susy contribution @xmath69 may not well approximate the full contribution , @xmath13 .",
    "the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath69 comes from the unobserved neutralino and chargino contributions to the muon @xmath6 , and should be understood as a theoretical error in the reconstruction of @xmath13 in our procedure .",
    "let us define @xmath80 this depends on @xmath81 and @xmath33 ( as well as on the parameters listed in table [ table : accuracy ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_gmin2 ] , contours of constant @xmath82 are shown for @xmath83 with the underlying parameters in table [ table : accuracy ] . , @xmath84 is smaller than that for @xmath83 with @xmath85 fixed .",
    "] in particular , @xmath86 is fixed . here ,",
    "the uncertainties in the parameters listed in table [ table : accuracy ] are omitted . obviously , @xmath87 is suppressed as @xmath81 and @xmath33 become larger .",
    "this is because all the diagrams that contain wino and higgsino propagators vanish in this limit , so that @xmath13 is well approximated by the bino  smuon diagram .",
    "thus , using lower bounds on the wino and higgsino masses provided by collider experiments , a bound on @xmath82 can be obtained .",
    "they will be searched for effectively at lhc with @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "if the wino and higgsino masses are constrained to be larger than @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) in future , @xmath92 is known to be smaller than @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) at our model point , which corresponds to @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) of @xmath69 .",
    "this is smaller than the dominant error of the reconstruction of @xmath69 .     and the ilc - reconstructed value , @xmath97 , on the wino mass vs.  higgsino mass plane .",
    ", width=264 ]    finally we comment on higher order contributions to @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite calculated photonic susy two - loop corrections , which change the one - loop result by @xmath98",
    ". they can be determined at ilc by the above procedure , because all the parameters necessary for them are measured simultaneously . in this letter , they are neglected for simplicity , although it is straightforward to include the contributions .",
    "also , corrections to the gaugino couplings and to the lepton yukawa couplings in the left - right mixing parameters can be as large as @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "importantly , they are already taken into account in the reconstruction of @xmath69 .",
    "most of the other two - loop contributions are considered to be suppressed in our sample point .",
    "however , electroweak and susy two - loop corrections to the susy one - loop diagrams , which have not been calculated , might be @xmath98 @xcite . since they could be as large as the dominant error of the reconstruction , it is important to calculate these two - loop contributions .",
    "in this letter , we have studied how and how accurately we can reconstruct the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 by using the information available at ilc . if @xmath13 is as large as @xmath99 to solve the muon @xmath6 anomaly , and also if all the sleptons as well as the lightest neutralino are within the kinematical reach , ilc will be able to measure the mssm parameters which are necessary to estimate @xmath13 .",
    "we have discussed the procedures and accuracies of their measurements .",
    "it has been shown that , in the sample point we choose , the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 can be reconstructed with the uncertainty of @xmath0 at ilc with @xmath17 and an integrated luminosity @xmath100 .",
    "this provides a very crucial test of the susy explanation to the muon @xmath6 anomaly .",
    "we should emphasize that the uncertainty depends on model points .",
    "as we have shown , the dominant error in the reconstructed value of @xmath69 originates in the uncertainty of the left - right mixing parameter @xmath26 in the sample point . for instance , if the heavier stau mass increases with the lighter one fixed , it is inferred from eq .   that the reconstruction would be degraded . on the contrary , if the charged sleptons in the second or third generation are degenerate in masses , the determination of @xmath101 could be improved considerably . unfortunately , slepton productions have not been studied for ilc in such cases .",
    "the present uncertainty of the experimental and sm values of the muon @xmath6 is about @xmath102 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "thus , the error in the reconstructed value of @xmath69 is sub - dominant when we test the idea of solving the muon @xmath6 anomaly with the susy contribution .",
    "however , the experimental measurement and theoretical calculation of the sm prediction will be improved in near future .",
    "the fermilab experiment @xcite and the j - parc new @xmath6/edm experiment @xcite will reduce the experimental error at least by a factor @xmath103 .",
    "the uncertainty of the sm prediction is dominated by those in the hadronic contributions .",
    "they will be improved by experiments as well as lattice calculations .",
    "the uncertainty is expected to be reduced by a factor @xmath104 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "if the experimental and sm central values would be unchanged , the error in @xmath15 could become as small as @xmath98 , which is comparable to that in @xmath69 .",
    "then , a precise reconstruction of the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 becomes crucial .",
    "we made several assumptions to evaluate the uncertainty , since we could not find enough information about the slepton production processes .",
    "precise studies of the slepton production process are strongly recommended to deeply understand how useful ilc is to reconstruct the susy contribution to the muon @xmath6 .",
