    "( [ eq : lnull ] ) .",
    "the elements of the correlation matrix ( [ eq : corrinf ] ) will be used to obtain the entanglement entropy of a block numerically as described in section [ sec : mm ] . in some simple cases",
    "one can already give an answer by looking at the limiting form of the correlations .",
    "taking @xmath88 , the impurity site will either be completely empty or completely occupied and therefore it becomes decoupled from the rest of the chain .",
    "one has @xmath89 while the contributions from the bound state also vanish @xmath90 , hence @xmath91 and the entropy will just be that of a homogeneous hopping model given by ( [ eq : enthom ] ) with @xmath92 .",
    "obviously , the limit of a vanishing coupling yields the same behavior .    on the other hand , one could take the limit @xmath93 for very strong coupling .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath94 , that is , one has resonant scattering at every wavelength .",
    "the ground state will correspond to a singlet formed by the impurity and site zero that is otherwise decoupled from the rest of the system .",
    "the bound state correlations contribute only on site zero @xmath95 while for sites @xmath96 one has @xmath97 , which is the form for a semi - infinite chain .",
    "the entropy of this geometry is known to scale logarithmically with a coefficient @xmath98 , which is half of the value that appears in the homogeneous case @xcite .     at half filling and for various coupling strengths @xmath13 .",
    "the upper and lower - most dashed lines have slopes @xmath99 and @xmath98 , respectively , acting as guides to the eye . ]",
    "the previous analysis shows that resonant scattering tends to decrease the coefficient of the entropy scaling .",
    "however , in general a fano resonance is concentrated around a single wavenumber .",
    "this is expected to have the largest effect on the asymptotic behavior if the location of the resonance coincides with the fermi - level @xmath100 yielding the condition @xmath101 .",
    "we take this value of the site energy in figure [ fig : entcrossover ] , in which we plot the entropy for a range of values for the coupling @xmath13 .",
    "we see that the entropy crosses over between the two limiting behaviors , giving a slope of @xmath99 for small @xmath7 and @xmath98 for large @xmath7 when plotted against @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , taking the block size large enough the impurity behaves like a cut in the chain .",
    "this effect is reminiscent of the kondo screening mechanism , where conduction electrons form a cloud around a magnetic impurity .",
    "the kondo effect has an associated length scale @xcite that being the distance beyond which the impurity appears to be screened off . in the present case a natural length scale also enters , which marks the asymptotic regime of the correlations and",
    "could be expected to appear in the entropy scaling . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnull ] ) one has @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which seems to be consistent with the location of the crossover moving toward larger @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : entcrossover ] as the coupling @xmath13 decreases . in order to reliably verify the scaling of the crossover length one would have to consider larger blocks .",
    "unfortunately , the achievable sizes were limited to @xmath106 by the increasing numerical difficulty in evaluating the oscillatory integrands for the matrix elements ( [ eq : corr1inf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath107 the screening cloud is effectively in a singlet state with the impurity electron and cuts the system in two parts .",
    "the coefficient of the entropy therefore renormalizes to the value @xmath98 corresponding to a semi - infinite chain with an open boundary .",
    "note , that a similar renormalization behavior was found for _ interacting _ electrons in the luttinger liquid regime bisected by a hopping defect @xcite .",
    "our further numerical analysis shows that , for arbitrary parameter values and @xmath108 , the entropy can be written in the form @xmath109 where the effective central charge @xmath6 varies continuously between the values @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the same behavior was found for free fermionic models with hopping defects @xcite where the dependence of @xmath6 on the defect strength was determined by data fits .",
    "recently , sakai and satoh derived the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy ] ) for the case of two conformal field theories coupled through a conformal interface . in their case they found @xmath6 in a closed form with dependence only on a single scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "these conformal interfaces describe a discontinuity in the compactification radii of two bosonic cfts , which correspond to luttinger liquids with unequal interaction parameters on the left and right hand side @xcite .",
    "although the result from @xcite is not directly applicable , a closely related form was recently found to describe the case of free fermions with simple interface defects @xcite .",
    "we therefore attempted to generalize these results to the present model .",
    "motivated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrfried ] ) , we argue that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath112 and thus @xmath6 should depend only on the scattering phase at the fermi - level and a suitable scattering amplitude can be defined as @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we propose @xmath114 where @xmath110 comes from the unmodified boundary while the integral is , up to a sign , the same as in @xcite and describes the contribution of the impurity .",
    "figure [ fig : ceffint ] shows the resulting @xmath6 obtained by fitting ( [ eq : entropy ] ) on different @xmath112 data sets together with ( [ eq : ceffint ] ) evaluated as a function of @xmath15 for various fixed values of the coupling @xmath13 and filling @xmath115 .",
    "one has excellent agreement with the conjectured analytical form .",
    "the only visible deviations arise for @xmath116 which can be understood through the crossover phenomenon shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : entcrossover ] . in this parameter regime",
    "the asymptotic behavior sets in only for larger @xmath7 and one has considerable finite - size corrections .     and for various values of @xmath13 and @xmath115 .",

    "exactly _ coincides with the transmission coefficient of the fano - anderson model @xcite with the fermi - energy set equal to zero .",
    "therefore , the effective central charge is directly linked to a simple physical quantity that , in experimental realizations , is obtainable via conductance measurements at very low temperatures .",
    "although the description of fano resonances measured in various nanostructure experiments @xcite typically require more detailed impurity models , the simple relation between @xmath6 and the transmission coefficient might still survive in some parameter regime .",
    "this could open up the possibility of an indirect measurement of the leading term in the entropy .",
    "it should be pointed out that the impurity integral in @xmath6 has been obtained _ analytically _ for a transverse ising chain in a dmrg geometry @xcite .",
    "the calculation relies on a correspondence between transfer matrix spectra of classical 2d ising models and the single - particle eigenvalues of @xmath119 in the reduced density matrix @xmath120 of the quantum chain .",
    "this analogy is well - known in the homogeneous case @xcite and can be extended by considering the transfer matrix of a 2d strip with a defect line . in turn , an alternative representation of the integral in ( [ eq : ceffint ] ) via dilogarithm functions was obtained . in our present model , however , a direct calculation of @xmath6 through the single - particle eigenvalues seems to be a far more challenging problem .     of the entropy as a function of @xmath15 for different fillings and @xmath121 .",
    "the homogeneous value @xmath3 has been subtracted for better comparison . ]",
    "we also extracted the subleading contribution @xmath122 in ( [ eq : entropy ] ) from our data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kfits ] for different values of the filling .",
    "its value @xmath3 without the impurity also depends on @xmath115 @xcite and was subtracted in the figure .",
    "one has a peaked structure around @xmath104 , however , unlike @xmath6 the constant @xmath122 is in general not symmetric with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "instead , one has the relation @xmath123 which is a direct consequence of the symmetry property eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrsymm ] ) of the correlations proven in appendix a.      in the last part of this section we will investigate the fluctuations in the number of electrons @xmath124 contained in the block next to the impurity .",
    "although being a simpler physical quantity , its scaling properties were shown to be similar to that of the entanglement entropy in a variety of 1d quantum systems @xcite and , in the case of free fermions , also in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "therefore it is an interesting question whether this connection persists for the present impurity problem .",
    "the particle number fluctuation is a simple quadratic function of the correlation matrix and without the impurity is readily evaluated as @xcite @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "note that here the leading - order logarithmic behavior was seen to emerge from the large distance decay properties of the correlations .",
    "therefore , we will use the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrfried ] ) to write @xmath127 . carrying out the traces ,",
    "one finds that the additional term @xmath128 has a logarithmic contribution while @xmath129 evaluates to a constant .",
    "the fluctuations then read @xmath130 with the prefactor given by @xmath131 .",
    "the result is tested by comparing with the fitted values of @xmath132 as shown on figure [ fig : fluctfits ] .",
    "the agreement is very good with the only sizeable deviations appearing in the region @xmath133 where the fano - resonance is close to the fermi - level and the approximation ( [ eq : corrfried ] ) breaks down for the numerically attainable block sizes .",
    "note , however , that in general the small distance deviations from the asymptotic form lead only to a different numerical value of @xmath134 as compared with the one obtained by evaluating the subleading terms in the traces",
    ". finally , one has to point out that , apart from the similar logarithmic scaling , the prefactor @xmath132 of the fluctuations is given by a much simpler function of the scattering amplitude than that governing the entropy .     of the logarithmic term in the particle number fluctuation for various values of @xmath13 and @xmath115 , plotted against the scaling variable @xmath135 .",

    ", we would like to cross - check our argument used for explaining eq .",
    "( [ eq : ceffint ] ) and show that the contributions in @xmath137 are additive .",
    "in other words , we want to test our expectation @xmath138 for the semi - infinite effective central charge @xmath139 of a subsystem with an open end . on the other hand ,",
    "boundaries were shown to induce interesting subleading behavior of the entropy for pure chains@xcite , therefore it is interesting to extend these investigations to the present impurity problem .",
    "the main difference from the infinite case is that the couplings @xmath140 are now dependent on the wavenumber . in principle",
    "the calculations are very similar , leading to slightly more lengthy expressions that are therefore summarized in appendix b. however , there is an additional feature which leads to the emergence of bound states in the continuum ( bic ) which were studied before @xcite .",
    "we will show how these bic naturally enter the problem at the correlation function level .",
    "our main interest is to determine the entropy of a block with @xmath141 sites located on the left hand side of the impurity .",
    "apart from the usual bound state contribution , the correlations from the conduction band now include @xmath142 with @xmath143 and we have defined the function @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy ( [ eq : sigmaqsi ] ) , respectively , and are related to the parameter @xmath78 of the infinite system as @xmath147 note that the term @xmath148 does not now appear in the correlations .",
    "it is instructive to analyze the main features of the integral in eq .",

    "the @xmath157 correspond exactly to the allowed wavenumbers in a _",
    "finite _ chain of length @xmath7 .",

    "the dashed lines have corresponding slopes @xmath162 and are shown for comparison . ]",
    "the above argument breaks down for special @xmath157-values fulfilling @xmath163 where @xmath156 becomes zero and the corresponding peak is missing .",
    "however , this is exactly the condition for the existence of the bic .",
    "it has been shown that these states have non - vanishing amplitude only at the impurity site and inside the segment where they reproduce , up to normalization , the eigenstates of a chain of length @xmath141 @xcite . for @xmath151",
    "even the normalization becomes exact and the contribution of the missing peak is therefore reincluded this way .",
    "while for these special values of @xmath15 the bic are exactly located at @xmath157 , the resonances of @xmath164 gradually shift towards the wavenumbers of the decoupled block as the coupling to the impurity becomes larger .",
    "hence , their contribution to the entropy is expected to diminish .",
    "the numerical study of the entropy is now carried out using the exact form of the correlations @xmath165 .",
    "the scaling of the entropy at half filling is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : entsicomm ] for various @xmath15 values . in agreement with our expectations ,",
    "the slope of the curves coincides well with @xmath138 as illustrated by the dashed lines .",
    "additionally , one observes large amplitude oscillations in the data which seem to persist for large values of @xmath7 .",
    "although such oscillations were already pointed out in case of quantum chains with a boundary , they were found to decay according to a power law and therefore vanish in the limit @xmath4 @xcite .    a qualitative argument for this alternation",
    "can be given by considering the main parameters ( [ eq : reimq ] ) entering the integrals .",
    "they contain oscillatory functions of @xmath37 that , for large @xmath8 , are expected to average out upon integration , yielding @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "these are just the values for the infinite case , explaining the average behavior of the entropy . however ,",

    "this form , in general , gives a good description of the alternating part .",
    "the results on @xmath175 are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : deltasfit ] against the variable @xmath135 .",
    "this choice is justified through our previous argument , where the only non - vanishing parameter is given by @xmath176 and thus the scattering phase of the infinite case is still expected to be a relevant scaling variable .",
    "the data shows indeed a nice collapse to an interpolated scaling function which is shown by the dotted line .",
    "it has a zero at @xmath177 corresponding to the pure semi - infinite chain where the alternating term is known to vanish asymptotically @xcite .",
    "note , that the symmetry under the exchange @xmath178 is valid also for @xmath112 itself .",
    "the behavior of the entropy becomes more complicated when we choose another value of the filling .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : entsiincomm ] where we have compared @xmath179 , corresponding to one - third filling , with @xmath180 which gives an _ incommensurate _",

    "[ fig : entsicomm ] .",
    "this corresponds to the three possible values @xmath181 and @xmath182 can take .",
    "however , in the incommensurate case the number of distinct values is infinite , resulting in a highly irregular entropy behavior .",
    "since @xmath183 , the effective central charges for the two cases are almost equal which explains why the averaged slope of the curves is very similar",
    ". nevertheless , for the small block sizes numerically achievable , the amplitude of the oscillations has the same magnitude as the average entropy .",
    "therefore , a quantitative understanding of the subleading term would be clearly desirable and requires further investigation .     and an incommensurate @xmath180 value of the filling .",
    "the parameters are @xmath184 and @xmath185 . ]",
    "we have studied the entanglement in the ground state of a single impurity problem described by the fano - anderson model , focusing on the analysis of the effective central charge that appears in the entropy scaling .",
    "we provided strong numerical evidence for the validity of a formula which gives the functional form of @xmath6 for arbitrary parameter values of the model .",
    "in particular , this formula depends only on a single parameter , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : intpar ] ) , that has a simple physical interpretation , namely it is the transmission coefficient of the impurity .",
    "this , in turn , establishes a connection between the entanglement entropy and the low temperature conductance of the quantum chain that can be measured in experiments with quantum - dot nanostructures @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to generalize the study of the block entropy for anderson - type impurities , including on - site coulomb interaction between electrons of different spin , that give a more realistic model of the quantum - dots in experiments and yet are still tractable with dmrg techniques .    on the other hand , an exact analytical treatment of the present problem is still lacking .",
    "one could follow the lines of ref.@xcite and try to relate the reduced density matrix to the transfer matrix of an appropriate 2d classical system .",
    "another possible approach would be the direct calculation of the entropy from the correlation matrix , which , in the pure case , requires knowledge of the eigenvalues of a toeplitz matrix @xcite . with an impurity",
    "one has a sum of toeplitz and hankel matrices , which poses a much more difficult problem .",
    "however , the analysis of the correlations has led to a simple asymptotic form , enabling us to calculate the particle number fluctuation that involves , instead of diagonalization , only the traces of the correlation matrix .",
    "the investigation of the semi - infinite geometry has , on one hand , supported our general belief that the leading contributions from both of the interfaces bordering the segment simply add up in the entropy . on the other hand , we found a subleading term which shows an interesting oscillatory behavior .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations remains finite even asymptotically , an effect that has not been observed for pure chains .",
    "although some arguments were given to describe its main features , a proper understanding could only be achieved through , analogous to the infinite case , a careful investigation of the asymptotic correlations .",
    "finally , it would be worth extending this study to the case where the impurity is located further apart from the boundary of the subsystem .",
    "if this distance grows large , the effective central charge must return to the value of a pure system and an interesting crossover behavior might emerge .",

    "the remaining solutions form a complex - conjugate pair @xmath201 and lie outside the unit disk .",
    "the closed contour @xmath202 therefore only encircles the pole at @xmath198 and the residue is evaluated as @xmath203 where @xmath74 is defined under eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrbinf ] ) . the remaining integral",
    "is taken along the contour @xmath204 which is parametrized as @xmath205 and using the analytic continuation of the scattering phase it reads @xmath206 note , that @xmath207 varies smoothly and vanishes for @xmath208 .",
    "for @xmath186 the integrand is rapidly decaying , thus one can approximate the phase around @xmath209 as @xmath210 . if the derivative is small , that is we are far away from the fano resonance , one can set @xmath211 and the integral ( [ eq : corr1intc2 ] ) can be trivially carried out to yield the result in eq .",

    ", if the impurity lies deep in the bulk of the chain with @xmath173 one has @xmath232 and consequently the same solutions for @xmath233 as in the infinite case .",
    "the contribution @xmath234 from the lower bound state can be evaluated as @xmath235 with the normalization factor @xmath236 the limit @xmath173 gives @xmath237 and the right hand side of ( [ eq : corrbsi ] ) becomes @xmath238 with the shifted indices @xmath239 and @xmath240 , thus recovering again the result ( [ eq : corrbinf ] ) for the infinite case .    finally , one needs the expression for the retarded self - energy inside the band @xmath241 which is an oscillatory function of the position @xmath8 .",
