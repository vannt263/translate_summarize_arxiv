    "the quantum dynamics of strong gauge fields coupled to fermions provides an important challenge for theoretical developments .",

    "since identical fermions can not occupy the same state , their quantum nature is highly relevant and a consistent quantum treatment of the fermion dynamics is of crucial importance . in thermal equilibrium",

    "the genuine quantum contributions included in this description are illustrated by giving a diagrammatic representation in a series expansion .",
