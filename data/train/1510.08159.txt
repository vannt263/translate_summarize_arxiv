    "in the studies  @xcite we discussed the existence of two distinct families of quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of nearly - extremal kerr ( nek ) black holes . in the schwarzschild spacetime ,",
    "the qnm frequencies at fixed angular quantum numbers @xmath0 are indexed by an overtone number @xmath1 , and have monotonically increasing decay rates with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "as the angular momentum of the black hole is increased , the qnm frequencies move around in the complex plane . for nearly extremal black holes some of these qnms asymptote to finite frequencies and decay rates , while others approach the critical frequency for superradiance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the angular frequency of the horizon , @xmath4 in the regime of interest , and @xmath5 is the spin parameter of the black hole ( here we set @xmath6 ) . in particular , the decay rate of these modes vanishes in the extremal limit , and we called them the zero - damped modes ( zdms ) .",
    "we found that whether or not some overtones remain damped in the extremal limit depends on the angular quantum numbers of the mode . defining @xmath7 ,",
    "the condition in the high - frequency limit is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "this condition is approximately obeyed at lower frequencies as well  @xcite .    in his note  @xcite",
    ", hod suggests that even in the case @xmath10 , modes with finite decay exist in the limit @xmath11 . his argument is based on the original analysis of detweiler  @xcite , which in fact predicts a finite decay rate for all modes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and gives a different prediction for the qnm frequencies in the nek limit than  @xcite . in our original studies we found no evidence for such modes . in this reply to  @xcite",
    ", we extend our analysis to the extremely small values ( @xmath12 ) where hod predicts that the qnms should obey detweiler s analytic prediction and asymptote to finite decay . as a particular example , for the case of @xmath13 , eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and  ( 8) of  @xcite predict the qnm frequencies to be @xmath14 with @xmath15 a value first suggested to us by s. hod in previous communication .",
    "we reiterate that this prediction for @xmath16 has a leading - order part which is independent of @xmath17 , although supposedly this prediction only holds at very small values of @xmath17 .",
    "we have searched for this behavior in the case of @xmath13 in two ways , which we discuss below .",
    "both methods rely on our implementation of leaver s continued fraction ( cf ) method  @xcite .",
    "we numerically search for the zeroes of a continued fraction as we vary @xmath16 , and we get accurate results for high spin parameters by actually varying the rescaled frequency @xmath18 .    our first method is to track the frequencies of the first seven overtones of the @xmath19 mode as we increase the spin parameter from a value well below where hod predicts new mode behavior ( @xmath20 ) to a value well above ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the frequencies at a given spin parameter are used iteratively to seed the frequency search at the next higher value .",
    "alternatively , we seed the search using our analytic approximation  @xcite at each value of @xmath5 when our search jumps to another family of overtones . in this way , we have no difficulty identifying the qnms and tracking them as we increase @xmath5 to nearly extremal values .",
    "none of the modes asymptotes to a fixed value of @xmath22 during this search , even though these qnms pass through the values given by eq .   in the regime of high spin parameter .",
    "in fact , all the modes are well fit by the analytic nek predictions of  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qnmtracks ] . note that we use the convention @xmath23 , so that @xmath22 is positive when the modes decay .",
    "this search indicates that if the qnms discussed by hod exist , they are not the nek limit of the qnms that exist at lower values of @xmath5",
    ". rather , they must spontaneously appear at some large value of the spin parameter , for example by emerging from a branch cut in the complex @xmath16 plane .",
    "this behavior seems unlikely given the analytic dependence of the teukolsky equations on @xmath5  @xcite , but see  @xcite .",
    "qnms , scaled by the asymptotic behavior @xmath24 .",
    "the set of points with the lowest decay rates ( blue ) correspond to the @xmath25 qnms at each @xmath17 , and each successive set of points corresponds to @xmath26 through @xmath27 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the analytic nek approximation discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we also plot the proposed decay rates from eq .",
    "( dashed lines ) , from @xmath25 ( upper right ) to @xmath28 ( lower left ) , which vary with @xmath17 only because of our scaling in this plot . ]",
    "our second method , which we found useful in our original studies , is to evaluate the cf throughout a region of the complex plane , and plot contours of constant cf value .",
    "the qnms appear in regions where the cf is approximately zero , with closed contours clustering around these points . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfplot ] we show the absolute value of the cf at the spin parameter @xmath29 in a region near the @xmath30 qnm frequency predicted by hod , @xmath31 .",
    "we see no sign of a qnm .",
    "the cf values are @xmath32 , which should be compared to the cf values of @xmath33 for the qnm frequencies of fig .",
    "[ fig : qnmtracks ] at this value of @xmath5 .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig : cfplot ] is densely sampled , with @xmath34 points plotted . in order to make such a dense sampling with a reasonable computational cost , we augment our continued fraction with a high - order and highly accurate analytic approximation for @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "we have also computed the cf in the region around the @xmath36 prediction for @xmath37 , and similarly for the @xmath25 predictions at these two values of the spin parameter , with no sign of a qnm .",
    "plane for the @xmath19 , @xmath30 ( second overtone ) qnm .",
    "the spin parameter is @xmath38 .",
    "the contours range from @xmath39 ( lower left ) to @xmath40 ( upper right ) in logarithmic steps of @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 marks the postulated dm frequency for @xmath30 . ]",
    "the absence of the dms discussed in hod s comment raises the concern that there is an error in the derivation of the frequencies in  @xcite .",
    "a careful review of this derivation reveals a possible issue .",
    "as discussed originally in  @xcite , the qnm frequencies are found in the nearly extremal case by a matching condition between two asymptotic solutions .",
    "the first ( inner ) solution is found in a region where @xmath43 using a scaled radius variable @xmath44 .",
    "the second ( outer ) solution is found where @xmath45 .",
    "these two solutions have a region of overlap where @xmath46 .",
    "the outgoing wave condition fixes the outer solution up to an overall normalization , and consistency with the large @xmath47 limit of the inner solution constrains the qnm in eqs .",
    "( 3.9 ) and  ( 3.16 ) are incorrect and must be reversed ; however the resulting eq .",
    "( 3.17 ) is correct . ] .    with the standard normalization that the amplitude of the qnm wavefunction is unity at the horizon , the inner solution has the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "here @xmath53 is an analogue for the angular eigenvalue ; @xmath54 for @xmath10 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 . in the large negative @xmath57 limit ,",
    "the solution becomes  @xcite @xmath58 the above formula should be compared to eq .",
    "( a9 ) in  @xcite , where this matching is first discussed , and where both hypergeometric functions are taken to be @xmath59 in the @xmath60 limit . in  @xcite and  @xcite , the assumption is made that @xmath61 becomes finite while @xmath62 decreases to zero , which means that @xmath63 .",
    "however , this invalidates the matching procedure , since now in addition to @xmath64 , @xmath65 also asymptotes to @xmath66 . as a result ,",
    "the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 no longer asymptote to @xmath59 , which conflicts the matching requirement imposed in  @xcite and assumed in  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the asymptotic form of qnms assumed in @xcite violates the condition for their baseline equation ( eq .  ( 9 ) of @xcite ) to hold in the first place .",
    "if one applies that baseline equation in the wrong range of validity , i.e.  with @xmath61 remaining finite in the @xmath69 limit , one can find the spurious solutions in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wavefunc ] shows that when @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) both approach large values , then the two hypergeometric functions have the wrong asymptotic limits for the matching .    .",
    "the solid lines represent the magnitudes of the real ( black ) and imaginary ( red ) part of @xmath67 .",
    "the dashed lines represent the magnitudes of the real ( black ) and imaginary ( red ) part of @xmath68 .",
    "the different scaling behaviors make the matching impossible . ]",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for the proposed damped modes when @xmath10 .",
    "the matching calculation which leads to these modes appears to be flawed , and a direct search using leaver s method gives no evidence for these modes .",
    "there is still room for further understanding on how the dms arise in the @xmath56 case .",
    "these dms can not be treated through the matching analysis that reveals the zdms , since their frequencies are not near the horizon frequency @xmath3 in the extremal limit .",
    "they can be understood qualitatively through a wkb analysis  @xcite , which indicates that these modes are associated with a region outside of the near - horizon region where the zdms are primarily localized  @xcite .",
    "the wkb analysis gives a good prediction for the lowest overtone dm in each case , and high order approximations can improve this .",
    "presently , numerical searches are the only way to accurately compute all of the dms in each case where @xmath56 .",
    "we hope that continued interest in the problem leads to new analytic techniques and further understanding of these modes in the future .",
    "in particular , open questions include how many modes of a given @xmath73 asymptote to finite decay in the extremal limit , and at what spin the spectrum bifurcates into two branches .",
