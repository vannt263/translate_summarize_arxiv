    "an interface between two conductors reduces charge ( electron or hole ) transport , transmitting a fraction @xmath13 of the incident current and reflecting the remainder @xmath14 .",
    "normal reflection plays a central role in andreev - reflection spectroscopy because also the andreev - reflected holes can be normal reflected .",
    "the btk theory for ballistic transport @xcite assumes that normal reflection affects them both in the same way .",
    "this enables to measure the transmission coefficient of normal - superconductor interfaces .",
    "ballistic transport requires that the electron mean free path is much larger than the contact diameter @xmath15",
    ". therefore one can reach the ballistic regime by making the contacts small enough .",
    "when the contacts are made larger , they become diffusive . in that case",
    "the elastic electron mean free path @xmath16 is much smaller than the contact diameter while the inelastic one @xmath17 is so large that the diffusive length @xmath18 still exceeds the contact diameter @xcite .",
    "blonder and tinkham @xcite explained the andreev reflection double - minimum structure of ballistic contacts - an enhanced resistance around zero bias inside the energy gap - with a combination of tunnelling through a dielectric layer and the mismatch of fermi velocities . by approximating the real dielectric barrier of width @xmath19 and height @xmath20 with a @xmath21-function of strength @xmath22 and assuming free electrons with @xmath23 being the ratio of fermi velocities @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the two electrodes , the transmission coefficient @xmath26 can be obtained from @xcite @xmath27 thus one could directly measure fermi - velocity ratios once the contribution @xmath28 of the dielectric barrier is known .    in a typical andreev - reflection experiment a dielectric oxide @xcite or water / ice layer",
    "@xcite has to be expected when the two electrodes and their contact are not prepared at ultra - high vacuum .",
    "and a junction between metals with different fermi surfaces causes normal reflection since the electron wave functions have to be adjusted across the interface .",
    "even a junction between two identical metals disrupts the crystal lattice and should lead to some amount of normal reflection .",
    "however , those effects are difficult to quantify .",
    "further complications arose when steglich _",
    "@xcite discovered heavy - fermion superconductors where the heavy conduction electrons with an extremely small fermi velocity form the cooper pairs .",
    "the first point - contact study of such compounds by u.  poppe @xcite and steglich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite focussed on giaever - type tunneling to measure the density of states of the new superconductors and the josephson effect to probe the symmetry of the heavy - fermion order parameter , without considering andreev reflection .",
    "e.  w.  fenton @xcite predicted a huge normal reflection coefficient , corresponding to @xmath29 , for interfaces between a conventional and a heavy - fermion metal because of fermi velocity mismatch .",
    "this idea got partial support by a large background residual resistance of heavy - fermion contacts where the cross - sectional area could be determined independently @xcite .",
    "however , the expected tunneling - like andreev reflection anomalies have not been found .",
    "deutscher and nozires @xcite explained the weak normal reflection observed in andreev - reflection experiments with heavy - fermion compounds by noting that the bare electrons and holes cross the interface , and not the heavy particles .",
    "this suggests that it is not the mismatch of fermi velocities but that of the fermi wave numbers that matters .",
    "equation ( [ z parameter ] ) remains valid with @xmath30 replaced by the ratio of fermi wave numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the electrodes . for interfaces between heavy - fermion compounds and conventional metals",
    "this ratio is of order unity , and therefore the @xmath6 parameter should be rather small . a number of point - contact andreev reflection experiments on heavy - fermion compounds , for example @xcite , support this interpretation . because heavy fermion metals often have an intrinsically short electron mean free path , it is possible that contacts with them are not ballistic but in the diffusive limit @xcite .",
    "also the proximity effect at superconducting - normal metal thin film layered structures depends strongly on the transparency of the interfaces @xcite .",
    "these experiments reveal that @xmath33 ( corresponding to @xmath34 ) for contacts between simple metals , considerably less than the expected @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in free - electron approximation .",
    "the thin films are deposited in ultra - high vacuum , which excludes a dielectric interface barrier and leaves fermi surface mismatch or a lattice discontinuity to explain the strong normal reflection .",
    "one can also measure directly the current perpendicular to plane ( cpp ) resistance of an interface with a well - defined geometry and large cross - sectional areas of order @xmath37m@xmath8 @xcite and compare it with electronic - structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the cpp resistance should contain information about normal reflection , but it is difficult to extract because of the lacking knowledge of the resistance without normal reflection .",
    "measuring electron spin polarization using andreev - reflection spectroscopy @xcite is another research topic that relies heavily on normal reflection and the ballistic nature of the contacts . according to the generally accepted view @xcite ,",
    "the true spin polarization is obtained at highly transparent interfaces when @xmath38 while the measured polarization drops with increasing normal reflection .",
    "this strong @xmath6 dependence of the polarisation does not match the results of the tedrow - meservey tunneling experiments @xcite performed in the opposite @xmath29 limit , possibly indicating that the interface transparency affects the measured polarization in a complicated way @xcite .",
    "so far we have discussed normal and andreev reflection in a one - dimensional model .",
    "both become more complicated in three dimensions as shown schematically in figure [ ballistic pc ] . since the momentum component parallel to the contact plane",
    "is assumed to be conserved but not the perpendicular one , only particles with angle of incidence @xmath39 can be transmitted , all others are reflected @xcite .",
    "thus , when the superconductor has the larger one of the wave numbers , only part of its fermi surface can be probed by andreev - reflection spectroscopy .",
    "total reflection does not occur in one dimension .",
    "a dielectric tunnelling barrier appears stronger in three than in one dimension because electrons or holes with off - axis incidence have a longer path through the barrier .",
    "thus the one - dimensional btk model over - estimates the @xmath28-parameter @xcite .",
    "one hopes that the transition between one- and three - dimensional modelling would change the btk parameters only slightly , and that the one - dimensional btk model would remain valid and a good description of the experiments @xcite .    in the one - dimensional btk model @xmath6",
    "is often treated as a simple fit parameter without further consideration .",
    "using andreev - reflection spectroscopy to determine material properties like the spin polarization or the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter requires understanding normal reflection because it is essential for electrical transport across an interface .",
    "we show here for contacts between superconducting indium ( in ) and several non - magnetic normal - conducting metals that in most cases the @xmath6 parameter is probably neither related to a dielectric barrier nor to fermi surface mismatch . assuming that the contacts down to atomic size are in the diffusive regime",
    "would naturally explain our results .",
    "point - contact experiments with superconducting indium ( in ) have a long history - junctions between in and normal metals have been investigated by chien and farrel @xcite even before the btk theory became established .",
    "our contacts were fabricated using the shear ( crossed wire ) method by gently touching one sample wire with the other one as described by j. i. pankove @xcite and more recently by chubov _",
    "the in wires had @xmath40 mm diameter to provide extra mechanical rigidity as much thinner wires would bend too easily when the contacts are made .",
    "the silver ( ag ) , palladium ( pd ) , platinum ( pt ) , and zinc ( zn ) wires had @xmath41 mm diameter .",
    "the contacts were measured below the critical temperature @xmath0k of in down to 0.1k in the vacuum region of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "a dc current @xmath42 with a small superposed ac component @xmath43 is injected into the contact and the voltage drop @xmath44 across the contact measured to obtain the @xmath45 characteristics as well as the differential resistance spectrum @xmath46 .",
    "point contacts with in were more difficult to fabricate than those with aluminium ( al ) @xcite . very often ,",
    "when we tried to set the resistance , the contact either opened with a vacuum gap between the electrodes or closed with an extremely small resistance of order @xmath7m@xmath47 which is unsuitable for spectroscopy .",
    "we attribute this behaviour to the softness of in .",
    "we classify the spectra as follows : 81% of the contacts had the typical andreev reflection double - minimum anomaly and were further analysed .",
    "5% of the contacts had additional anomalies , like a dip at zero bias , that we tend to attribute to proximity - induced superconductivity in the normal metal .",
    "the remaining 14% of the contacts showed spectra as in figure [ spectra - in - bad ] with excessive side peaks or with anomalies that we do not really understand and which we do not consider further .",
    "table [ distribution ] lists the details for the investigated normal conductors .",
    ".distribution of contact type : andreev denotes contacts that could be analysed , proximity - like contacts look like those where superconductivity has been induced in the normal metal , and undefined are all others which can not be clearly identified . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figures [ para-2d0 ] , [ para - g ] , and [ para - z ] show the derived parameters @xmath48 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 as function of normal resistance @xmath49 for contacts between superconducting in and normal conducting ag , pd , pt , and zn , respectively .",
    "the energy gap @xmath50mev is roughly constant from @xmath51 up to @xmath52k@xmath47 .",
    "most contacts have a @xmath4 that varies between @xmath53ev and @xmath54ev without a clear tendency .",
    "the lifetime parameter @xmath4 grows slightly with increasing resistance only for the contacts with ag , independently of the temperature .",
    "the @xmath6-parameter stays constant at 0.5 from @xmath55 up to several @xmath7k@xmath47 and varies by less than @xmath11 from one normal conductor to another one .",
    "larger @xmath6-values appear for in - ag junctions in the @xmath56k@xmath47 range and for the in - zn contacts above @xmath57 .",
    "the btk parameters of our contacts with superconducting in correspond well with those of superconducting al @xcite . unlike @xmath58 of al , that increases with @xmath49 , the in contacts have a rather constant @xmath50mev .",
    "a systematic increase of @xmath4 with @xmath49 like for the al contacts has only been found for in - ag contacts , but to a lesser degree . for contacts with the other normal - conducting metals @xmath4 ranges from @xmath53ev to @xmath54ev . however , most notable is @xmath59 over up to five orders of magnitude in normal state resistance @xmath49 like for superconducting al @xcite .",
    "point contacts with superconducting nb , measured at @xmath60k , have slightly larger average z but with a wider variation @xcite . in the discussion",
    "we will focus on the seemingly universal value of @xmath6 .",
    "* contact diameter .",
    "* we estimate the contact diameter @xmath15 with the ballistic sharvin resistance @xmath61 where @xmath62 . in free - electron approximation",
    "the used metals have fermi wave numbers @xmath63nm@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "then a @xmath65 contact has a diameter of @xmath66 nm , assuming circular symmetry , or @xmath67 cross - sectional area .",
    "thus our study covers contact areas from @xmath9nm@xmath8 to less than @xmath7nm@xmath8 . according to the residual normal - state resistivity of the bulk metals we estimate elastic mean free paths of @xmath68 nm . therefore contacts with normal resistance @xmath69 should be ballistic , justifying our use of the btk model .    * superconducting energy gap .",
    "* the energy gap @xmath50mev is almost constant from around @xmath55 up to about @xmath56k@xmath47 .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 is larger than the bcs value 3.52 and the tunnelling - derived bulk value of 3.58 @xcite .",
    "a slightly enhanced energy gap has been found earlier for in break junctions @xcite .",
    "these deviations could be caused by the pressure or lattice distortion at the contact .",
    "* lifetime parameter . *",
    "the lifetime parameter @xmath4 was originally introduced by dynes _",
    "_ @xcite to describe the enhanced pair breaking in superconducting lead alloy films .",
    "a point contact could cause pair breaking since it disturbs locally the crystal lattice symmetry . as an alternative explanation , raychaudhuri _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that an inhomogeneous superconducting gap in the contact region could also lead to a finite @xmath4-value .",
    "a similar approach was used by bobrov _",
    "the order parameter can be reduced at the interface , and cooper pairs can leak into the normal metal .",
    "this could also explain the zero - bias dip in the spectra of in - zn junctions well above the critical temperature of zn as shown in figure [ spectra - in - zn - pe ] .",
    "* dielectric barrier .",
    "* metal surfaces usually oxidize when they are exposed to air . because our setup does not allow transferring the samples to the refrigerator under ultra - high vacuum conditions ,",
    "the sample surfaces are very likely oxidized .",
    "for example ,",
    "a typical metal oxide al@xmath71o@xmath72 on bulk al has a thickness of @xmath73 nm and a potential height of @xmath74ev @xcite . assuming a fermi velocity @xmath75km / s @xcite we obtain @xmath76 , varying from 1 to more than 10 .",
    "the @xmath12 observed in our experiments corresponds to a significantly weaker tunnel barrier .",
    "we have found considerably larger @xmath6-values occasionally .    only when the contacts are very small , the intrinsic cleaning process of the shear method , when the two sample wires slide along each other before the contact forms , might fail and preserve a nearly undisturbed dielectric layer of the atomic - size contacts .",
    "the @xmath6-value increases in the k@xmath47-range towards the transition to vacuum tunneling .",
    "such high - resistance contacts consist of a few conduction channels , each with its own transmission coefficient . for the zn contacts",
    "the deviations appear already at @xmath77 , possibly indicating that zno is more difficult to remove or to damage than the other metal oxides . or it could be due to zno being a semiconductor instead of an insulator @xcite .",
    "the argument against a tunnelling barrier is the independence of the @xmath6-parameter from contact size and normal metal electrode .",
    "in addition , reflection at a dielectric barrier should lead to a strong variation of @xmath6 , depending on how a specific contact is made , because the transmission probability depends exponentially on the barrier width and height @xcite .",
    "therefore we would have expected @xmath6 not to converge to a single value , but to vary from almost zero , the lower bound defined by fermi surface mismatch according to eq .",
    "[ z parameter ] , to @xmath78 with a thick and nearly undisturbed oxide layer .    * fermi surface mismatch .",
    "* electrons as well as andreev - reflected holes travel through a dielectric tunneling barrier with a certain probability , while the rest are normal reflected",
    ". however , normal reflection due to fermi surface mismatch is different .",
    "this becomes obvious in the three - dimensional model : using the notation of figure [ ballistic pc ] , electrons with the direction of incidence @xmath79 can not cross the interface @xcite , and therefore can not take part in andreev reflection .",
    "since only electrons that have been transmitted can be andreev - reflected , the retro - reflected holes have already the right properties to be transmitted back through the interface and are treated as described by the btk model .",
    "this isotropic case might approximate contacts between metals with nearly spherical fermi surface , like potassium ( k ) or ag , but it should fail for the transition metals , like nb or tantalum ( ta ) .",
    "their fermi surfaces , that determine the transport processes , can consist of multiple sheets or isolated pockets @xcite .",
    "therefore one should expect a pronounced difference with respect to andreev and normal reflection when nearly free - electron metals , both normal and superconducting , are compared to the transition metals .",
    "this has not been found : for example the shape of the andreev reflection spectra of contacts with nb looks very similar to that of spectra with al @xcite .    a practical argument against fermi surface mismatch in our point contacts is , like discussed above with respect to a dielectric barrier , the small variation of the @xmath6-parameter .",
    "each time we make a new contact , the orientation of the crystallites that form it also changes , and the @xmath6-parameter should change accordingly .",
    "the same should happen when the normal conductor is replaced .",
    "this is not observed",
    ".    * diffusive limit .",
    "* figure [ diffusive pc ] shows schematically a diffusive contact between two metal electrodes .",
    "the size of the link @xmath80 between the electrodes corresponds to the point - contact diameter @xmath15 .",
    "the contact is diffusive when this length is much larger than the elastic electron mean path but shorter than the diffusion length @xmath81 . under these conditions electrons flowing through the constriction",
    "suffer many elastic scattering processes , loosing the directional information of their momentum , but keep their energy at zero bias voltage or gain the excess energy @xmath82 when a bias voltage is applied .",
    "this is valid even if the electrodes have a much larger electron mean free path or superconducting coherence length .",
    "naidyuk _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have already noticed that a @xmath6-parameter between 0.4 and 0.5 is often found for superconducting point contacts , including those with heavy - fermion and high - temperature superconductors .",
    "naidyuk and yanson @xcite have suggested that the contacts could be in the diffusive limit as described by mazin _",
    "@xcite who showed that the spectra of diffusive contacts without an interface barrier are almost identical to those of ballistic contacts with a finite @xmath6-parameter close to 0.55 .",
    "@xcite had derived this result earlier , and it is also mentioned in the seminal paper by blonder _",
    "note that typical contacts used for andreev - reflection spectroscopy usually have a resistance of less than @xmath77 and , thus , a diameter of more than a few nm",
    ". such contacts could easily be in the diffusive regime .    according to our earlier results on in break junctions @xcite with an elastic mean free path of 25 nm in the contact region , our contacts with normal resistance below @xmath65 are probably in the diffusive regime .",
    "when the contacts are made smaller , they should become ballistic .",
    "however , we can not notice any change of contact properties that would indicate a transition between the two transport regimes .",
    "therefore , in our earlier paper on contacts with superconducting al @xcite we have implicitly assumed that large resistance contacts would be ballistic , and , without noticing a changing behaviour , that they would stay ballistic when the contact resistance is reduced .",
    "maybe the converse argument is more appropriate .",
    "understanding the role of normal reflection is an especially important topic for applying andreev - reflection spectroscopy to investigate unconventional superconductors or the local spin polarization of ferromagnets .",
    "we have found that the btk @xmath6-parameter of interfaces with superconducting in does neither depend sensitively on the size of the contacts nor on the normal - conducting counter electrode .",
    "this agrees well with our earlier data for interfaces with superconducting al .",
    "the tiny variation of @xmath6 over a wide range of contact areas has lead us to conclude that a dielectric tunneling barrier as well as fermi surface mismatch do not contribute significantly .",
    "one explanation for this behaviour could be that all of our contacts are in the diffusive limit .",
    "our results question the nature of the parameters derived from one - dimensional ballistic models in point - contact andreev - reflection spectroscopy and call for an investigation of the effects of dimensionality and transport regime .",

    "<S> the btk @xmath6-parameter was close to 0.5 , corresponding to transmission coefficients of about @xmath10 , independent of the normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6-parameter varies by less than @xmath11 around its average value , indicating that the interfaces have a negligible dielectric tunneling barrier . </S>",
