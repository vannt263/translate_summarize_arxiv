    "blazars dominate the scene of extragalactic gamma ray astronomy as space borne missions and erenkov atmospheric telescopes have shown . bl lac objects ( bl lacs or blls ) are a main sub - class of _ blazars _ that by definition exhibit featureless spectra or very weak lines , most probably because of the relativistic enhancement of the continuum .",
    "surely , the recent launch of agile and glast gamma - ray observatories and the upgrading of the existing ground - based erenkov telescopes will significantly increase the interest in the bl lac objects .",
    "the determination of the redshift is mandatory in order to characterize these sources ( e.g.  to determine nuclear and host galaxy luminosity of the sources ) , but it is arduous , in most of the objects , to detect the weak spectral features over the continuum .",
    "indeed , a redshift determination exists for only about half of the known blls .",
    "the detection of the weak spectral lines necessarily requires the use of @xmath9 meters telescopes .",
    "in addition to the issue of redshift , high s / n and spectral resolution are also of importance for detecting the host galaxy independently of imaging , since its emission may appear superposed to the non - thermal continuum of the nucleus .",
    "absorption lines may be related to the host galaxy itself , to the intergalactic medium and to the interstellar medium of our galaxy and its halo .",
    "the emission lines are the most direct probe to the physical conditions around the nucleus .",
    "we have an ongoing program for bl lac s spectroscopy at the european southern observatory ( eso ) @xmath10 meter very large telescope ( vlt ) , which utilizes the telescope in service mode under non - optimal seeing conditions .",
    "the results of the first three runs ( 2003 and 2004 ) referred to 35 blls .",
    "we measured new redshifts for 17 sources , while for the rest of the objects we have given upper limits using a technique specifically designed for this project .",

    "in this paper we present the spectra of 15 objects observed in 2006 ( guest observer run : eso 077.b-0045 ) .",
    "data reduction and analysis procedures are described in section 2 .",
    "results are reported in section 3 along with specific comments about each source .",

    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : h@xmath11=70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13=0.7 , @xmath14=0.3 .",
    "the observations ( table [ tab : journal ] ) were performed between 2006 march through august in service mode at the eso vlt ut2 ( kueyen ) telescope , equipped with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) , using the 300v+i grism combined with a 2 slit , yielding a dispersion of 112   mm@xmath12 ( corresponding to 2.64   pixel@xmath12 ) and a spectral resolution of 15   covering the 38008000   range .",
    "the seeing during observations was in the range 0.5 - 2.5 , with an average of 1 .",
    "we performed data reduction using iraf @xcite , following the standard procedures for spectral analysis .",
    "this includes bias subtraction , flat fielding , and removal of bad pixels . for each target",
    ", we obtained three spectra for an optimal correction of the cosmic rays and to check for the reality of weak spectral features .",
    "the individual frames were then combined into a single average image .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the spectra of a he / ne / ar lamp , resulting in an accuracy of @xmath153   ( rms ) . from these calibrated final images",
    ", we extracted the one - dimensional spectra inside a 2@xmath166aperture , adopting an optimal extraction algorithm @xcite to improve the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .    as a part of a fill - in program",
    ", our observations did not require optimal photometric conditions . however , the sky was clear for most of the observations .",
    "this enabled us to perform a spectrophotometric calibration of the data using standard stars @xcite .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of the order of 10% in the flux calibration because of the not optimal sky condition .",
    "flux losses due to the slit not being oriented along the parallactic angle are negligible with respect to the flux calibration uncertainties .",
    "all the spectra were dereddened following the extinction law by @xcite and assuming the e@xmath17 values computed by @xcite .",
    "in figure [ fig : spectra ] we give the optical spectrum for each source . in order to make apparent the shape of the continuum and the faint spectral features , we report both the flux calibrated and the normalized spectra .",
    "intrinsic and intervening spectral features are identified with atomic species .",
    "absorptions caused by the galactic interstellar medium are indicated with ism for simple atomic species , and with dib ( diffuse interstellar band ) for complex molecules .",
    "the earth symbol is used to mark telluric absorptions .",
    "all spectra can be retrieved in electronic form at ` http://www.oapd.inaf.it/zbllac/ ` , where all the results of our program are archived .",
    "the optical spectrum of a bl lac can be described , in a first approximation , as the superposition of two components .",
    "the first one is a non - thermal continuum emitted by the active nucleus .",
    "the second is the contribution from the stars and the ism of the bll host galaxy .",
    "extensive studies in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that these galaxies are usually giant ellipticals the optical magnitudes of which follow a narrow gaussian distribution centered around m@xmath18 @xcite . in most cases",
    "the host galaxy signature was not detected in our spectrum because it was too faint with respect to the nuclear component .",
    "for these objects , we performed a fit of the optical continuum with a simple power - law model ( @xmath19 ) . in two cases",
    "however ( rbs 1752 and rbs 1915 ) the host galaxy spectral features were detected , and we performed a fit to the spectrum using a two component model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : specdec ] ) : a power - law plus an elliptical galaxy spectrum as in the template given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also s06 for details on the fitting procedure ) .",
    "the results from our fits are reported in table [ tab : fits ] , where for each object we give the power - law index , the object class the apparent magnitude , and the extinction coefficient . for rbs 1752 and",
    "rbs 1915 we report also the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies corrected for the aperture effect which were m@xmath20 and m@xmath21= -22.4 respectively , in agreement with the expected distribution .",
    "since emission and absorption lines in a bll spectrum can be very faint , their detection can be a difficult task . using the same technique presented in s06 , we estimated the minimum detectable equivalent width ew@xmath22   for each spectrum , and considered all features with equivalent width ( ew ) above this threshold as line candidates which were then",
    "carefully inspected for identification or rejection .",
    "ew@xmath22   values for each spectrum are given in table 1 , while line identifications , full width half maximum ( fwhm ) and ew are reported in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "the continuum and line properties confirmed the bl lac classification for 12 objects .",
    "in section [ sec : notes ] we report notes on the individual sources .",
    "most of the confirmed bll in our sample show featureless spectra , despite the high s / n reached using vlt . as extensively discussed in s06 ( 4.2.4 ) , it is possible to estimate a lower limit to the redshift of such sources , knowing the ew@xmath22   and the nucleus apparent magnitude and exploiting the assumption that bl lac hosts can be considered as candles @xcite .",
    "we remark here that equation 1 in s06 contains a typographical error , which was noted also by @xcite .",
    "the correct expression is : @xmath23 where ew@xmath24 is the observed equivalent width , ew@xmath25 is the equivalent width of the feature in the host galaxy template @xcite , @xmath26 is the nucleus - to - host flux ratio , @xmath27 is the redshift and @xmath28 is the aperture correction .",
