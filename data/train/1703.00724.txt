    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite is a well - established approach to study the time - dependent and excitation properties of many - electron systems .",
    "one of the main reasons for its popularity is that within this formalism the time - dependent interacting many - body problem can be recast exactly into an equivalent one - particle framework , advantageous for numerical implementations .",
    "the corresponding one - particle equations , called the time - dependent kohn - sham equations , contain an effective potential , known as the kohn - sham potential , which is defined in such a way that the non - interacting system has the same time - dependent density as the original interacting many - body system .",
    "the kohn - sham potential is typically written as the sum of the external potential of the interacting system and of the hartree and the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential .    in practical applications of tddft , the xc - potential @xmath0 is approximated .",
    "the type of approximation employed crucially determines the quality of the results , and therefore a considerable amount of research has gone into the difficult task of finding reliable and accurate approximations for this quantity .",
    "this task is simpler in the linear response regime where we consider small variations in the density caused by applied perturbations .",
    "this regime is of interest as the knowledge of the density response function is sufficient to calculate the excitation energies and the absorption spectrum of the system  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "it is enough to know @xmath1 and its functional derivative @xmath2 with respect to the density @xmath3 , evaluated at the ground - state density .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is called the xc - kernel and has been the subject of intense investigations .    the simplest possible approximation is the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) in which the xc - kernel is local in space and time .",
    "the alda has , however , a number of deficiencies  @xcite such as , for example , the inability to produce correct charge transfer excitations @xcite and born - oppenheimer surfaces of excited states in dissociating molecules @xcite and semiconductor band gaps  @xcite .",
    "some improvements have been made using hybrid functionals which contain mixtures of exact exchange and traditional local functionals .",
    "these methods are non - local in space but still adiabatic .",
    "however , they are not systematic and the optimal mixture of exact - exchange is often system - dependent  @xcite .",
    "other , more systematic , approximations for @xmath4 beyond the alda often rely on perturbative expansions @xcite and many of them are restricted to the exchange - only approximation .",
    "their perturbative nature makes these approaches questionable in the strong correlation regime which is relevant in various physical situations , notably the case of molecular dissociation , and hence it is highly desirable to develop new techniques to tackle this regime .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite the so - called strictly correlated electrons ( sce ) framework @xcite , a formalism well suited for the description of strong interactions , has been applied within the time - dependent domain .",
    "the authors derived an expression for the xc kernel in the so - called adiabatic approximation and established that the adiabatic sce ( asce ) kernel satisfies the zero force theorem @xcite , an exact property related to generalized translational invariance @xcite .",
    "the kernel was furthermore studied for finite one - dimensional systems with different density profiles , some of which are prototypical of the dissociation of two - electron homonuclear molecules .",
    "it was found that the asce kernel is spatially non - local and exhibits a divergent behavior as the molecular bond is stretched . for adiabatic kernels this diverging behavior is crucial  @xcite for describing bond - breaking excitations , which is a notoriously challenging problem in linear response tddft .",
    "since the kernel was derived in the adiabatic approximation , not much could be concluded about the limitations of its adiabatic nature in the context of the physics of strong static correlation .",
    "the case of infinitely strong electron - electron correlation is quite peculiar and to date it is not known how accurate the adiabatic approximation can be in such a regime .",
    "one way to shed light on this issue is to benchmark the asce kernel against an exact expression for @xmath5 obtained from a model system where the density response function and thus the xc - kernel can be calculated analytically . in this work we consider such a model , namely two interacting electrons on a quantum ring @xcite , for which not only we compute the exact density response function and xc - kernel , but we also obtain these quantities for various two - body interaction strengths , including the infinitely strong one , and we compare these results with those given by the sce theory in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the leading order of the asymptotic expansion for the exact @xmath4 and the expression for the asce kernel are found to be identical .",
    "we also derive the next order correction term beyond the asce , called the adiabatic zero - point - energy approximation ( azpe ) , and show that also this adiabatic term is the same as the next order from the asymptotic expansion .",
    "the third order in the expansion for the kernel is still adiabatic , while a frequency dependence appears in the fourth order . in this order ,",
    "an adiabatic approximation would break down .",
    "this is one of the central results of the paper and elucidates both the strengths and the weaknesses of the adiabatic approximation in the limit of strong electron - electron interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we introduce the quantum ring model and , after computing the full spectrum of its hamiltonian , we discuss asymptotic expansions for its eigenenergies and eigenstates in the case of strong interactions and analyze them . in sec .",
    "[ secdensityresponse ] we study the density response function of strongly interacting systems , while in sec .",
    "[ sectddftstrong ] we focus on tddft in the same regime and give an asymptotic expansion for the xc - kernel .",
    "our conclusions are finally presented in sec .",
    "[ secconclusions ] .",
    "for our study of electron correlations we consider an analytically solvable model , which we will refer to as the quantum ring model , of two electrons on a ring of length @xmath6 which repel each other with a two - body interaction . the interaction strength can be adjusted using a parameter , which allows us to study the exact properties of the system ranging from weak to very strong interactions .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian of the quantum ring is given by : @xmath7     \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath9 has units of energy .",
    "the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the coordinates of the electrons on the ring which run from @xmath12 to @xmath6 .",
    "the ground - state density @xmath13 is spatially constant and independent of @xmath14 ; for this reason the model can be used to illustrate several features of the coupling strength dependence in density functional theory .    in order to calculate the properties of the system we have to determine the eigenfunctions @xmath15 which satisfy the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the energy eigenvalues . for our two - particle system",
    "these eigenfunctions can be written as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin function as follows @xmath18 for the singlet case ( which we will focus on ) the normalized spin function is given by @xmath19 and is anti - symmetric in the spin variables .",
    "for the triplet there are three linearly independent symmetric spin functions which we , for simplicity , all denote by @xmath20 .",
    "since the two - electron wave function @xmath15 is anti - symmetric under the simultaneous interchange of space and spin variables it follows that the spatial wave functions @xmath21 satisfy the symmetry relation @xmath22 apart from these symmetry conditions , the schrdinger equation needs to be solved with periodic boundary conditions on the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. the wave function and its first spatial derivatives are invariant under the substitution @xmath23 for @xmath24 . using these conditions we can solve the schrdinger equation by a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "since these steps are carried out in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite here we just outline the main steps relevant for this work .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) becomes separable in the terms @xmath25 , the center - of - mass coordinate , and @xmath26 , the dimensionless relative coordinate .",
    "this variable transformation gives @xmath27 by inserting a product ansatz of the form @xmath28 into the schrdinger equation we find that the spatial two - particle eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an integer and the function @xmath31 satisfies the mathieu equation which we write in its standard form as @xcite @xmath32 m ( z ) =   a \\ , m(z )   \\label{eq : mathieu}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given by : @xmath35 for a given value of @xmath33 the mathieu equation ( [ eq : mathieu ] ) has only periodic solutions for particular values @xmath36 which are called the mathieu characteristic values . moreover this equation has either even or odd periodic solutions which are called the mathieu cosine and mathieu sine functions respectively",
    ". both sets of functions form a countable set , therefore its members can be labeled by a non - negative integer @xmath37 . for",
    "the mathieu cosines this label starts at @xmath38 and for the mathieu sines at @xmath39 .",
    "the even mathieu cosine function is denoted by @xmath40 and its characteristic value by @xmath41 , while the odd mathieu sine function is denoted by @xmath42 and its characteristic value by @xmath43 .",
    "since the center - of - mass wave functions are symmetric under the interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons we see from eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) that the singlet wave functions must be described by even mathieu functions whereas the triplet ones must be described by odd mathieu functions .",
    "the final form of the normalized singlet and triplet wave functions therefore is @xmath44 in which the normalization of the mathieu functions is chosen such that @xmath45 the mathieu functions further have the periodicity property @xmath46 , i.e. they are periodic in @xmath47 for even values of @xmath37 and anti - periodic for odd values of @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore the center - of - mass wave function in eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) changes with a prefactor @xmath48 when @xmath49 , for @xmath24 .",
    "therefore for the wave functions in eqs.([eq : kl_singlet ] ) and ( [ eq : kl_triplet ] ) to satisfy periodic boundary conditions the labels @xmath30 and @xmath37 must be both even or both odd . note that @xmath30 runs over all integers while @xmath37 only runs over the non - negative integers . from eq.([eq",
    ": mathieu_characteristic ] ) we see that the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath50 .",
    "\\label{eq : energykl}\\ ] ] since in the subsequent discussion of the density response function we focus on the singlet excitations in particular , we write the singlet wave functions in a slightly different form for the purpose of a better interpretation . multiplying the spatial wave function of eq.([eq : kl_singlet ] ) with its singlet spin function , the full space - spin function can be written as @xmath51\\ ] ] where we defined the slater determinant @xmath52 and we further defined the spatial normalized orbital by @xmath53 which corresponds to a periodic single - particle wave function of a free particle on the quantum ring .",
    "let us consider the excitation from the ground - state to another singlet state with @xmath38 , which requires that the excited state is characterized by an even @xmath30 value . in that case @xmath54 in the slater determinant",
    "above is a proper periodic wave function as @xmath55 is an integer .",
    "according to eq.([eq : energykl ] ) the excitation energy is @xmath56 which is independent of the interaction strength @xmath33 as the excited state has the same relative wave function as the ground state . for the case that @xmath57 we have @xmath58 and the ground and excited state both become pure slater determinants .",
    "the excitation then represents a promotion of two electrons from a doubly occupied @xmath59 state to a doubly occupied state with a one - particle quantum number @xmath55 , which is commonly called a double excitation .",
    "when @xmath33 is non - zero this language is not accurate anymore as also the relative wave function becomes relevant .",
    "if the interaction strength becomes very large the energy required to excite to a state with non - zero @xmath37 becomes very large too and the excitations with energy @xmath60 give the dominant contribution to the density response function , as we will see later .      as the interaction strength @xmath33 increases , the electronic repulsion becomes more important and the electrons tend to stay in opposite positions on the ring .",
    "this physically intuitive picture can be analyzed in more detail using the mathieu equation . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kl_singlet ] ) and ( [ eq : kl_triplet ] ) , the square of the spatial wave function is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is either a mathieu cosine @xmath63 or a mathieu sine @xmath64 depending on whether the wave function is a singlet or a triplet one .",
    "we therefore see that the probability to find a given electron at @xmath11 given an electron at @xmath10 only depends on the relative coordinate @xmath65 , as one would expect on the basis of the symmetry of the system .",
    "this probability distribution is given by the square of the mathieu function @xmath66 .",
    "let us analyze the properties of this function in the large interaction limit which according to eq.([eq : mathieu ] ) satisfies a single - particle schrdinger type of equation in a potential of the form @xmath67 .",
    "for large values of @xmath33 we can see that the relative wave function described by @xmath66 becomes localized in the minimum of the potential at @xmath68 , which corresponds to a relative distance of the particles of @xmath69 .",
    "we can expand the potential around this minimum to obtain @xmath70 this potential describes ( apart from a shift of the minimum ) a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath71 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator are well known to consist of gaussians of width proportional to @xmath72 . in the limit of large @xmath33",
    "the harmonic frequency increases and the wave functions become localized around @xmath68 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig.([wavepotential ] ) .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath73 of the harmonic oscillator are well - known and given by @xmath74 .",
    "this also immediately provides an asymptotic formula for the characteristic value of the mathieu equation for large values of @xmath33 : @xmath75 and consequently also an asymptotic expansion for the eigenenergies of the quantum ring from eq.([eq : energykl ] ) .     for two values of the interaction strength @xmath33 , and the interaction @xmath76 using a suitable scaling for showing it in the same plot . for large @xmath33 ,",
    "the wave function localizes around @xmath68 where @xmath77 is almost parabolic and @xmath78 then tends to a sharp gaussian .",
    "[ wavepotential ] , scaledwidth=43.0% ]    a more rigorous connection to the harmonic oscillator wave functions can be made on the basis of the substitution @xmath79 which transforms the mathieu equation ( [ eq : mathieu ] ) to the new form @xmath80 \\mathcal{m}(u)= \\epsilon \\ ,   \\mathcal{m}(u ) \\nonumber\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in the large @xmath33 limit",

    "on the basis of this analysis we may suspect that it is possible to find an asymptotic large-@xmath33 expansion of the mathieu functions in terms of harmonic oscillator functions @xmath86 of argument @xmath87 .",
    "sips @xcite already derived such an expansion on the basis of the transformed mathieu equation . for reference in the next section we briefly outline its main features for the case of the mathieu cosine which is relevant for the discussion of singlet states .",

    "in general they can be obtained from a recursion relation @xcite and we refer to appendix  [ app : sips ] for a more detailed discussion .    in eq.([eq : sips_cosine ] ) we see that for odd values of @xmath37 the mathieu cosine is expanded in functions @xmath86 with only odd values of @xmath91 while for even @xmath37 it is expanded in functions @xmath86 with only even values of @xmath91 .",
    "this follows directly from the derivation by sips  @xcite but we see with hindsight that this condition is necessary to make the mathieu cosine satisfy @xmath92 .",
    "namely , if we replace @xmath93 by @xmath94 then the variable @xmath87 changes to @xmath95 yielding this desired property for a series of the form ( [ eq : sips_cosine ] ) since @xmath96 . the sips expansion , eq.([eq : sips_cosine ] ) , will be used in the next section to determine the large interaction expansion of the density response function .",

    "since the unperturbed system is time - independent , the density response function is a function of the relative time @xmath110 only and we can fourier transform it with respect to @xmath111 : @xmath112 before addressing in greater detail the properties of @xmath106 of the quantum ring in the large interaction limit , let us first make some considerations about the static density response function in a more general context .",
    "let us consider an interacting many - electron system in its ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of a kinetic energy operator , an external potential @xmath113 and a two - body interaction .",
    "if we consider a small variation @xmath114 in the static external potential , the ground - state density will vary by an amount @xmath115 which can be expressed as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the static density response function .",
    "let us now consider a shifted potential @xmath118 .",
    "the ground - state density for this new potential is given by @xmath119 .",
    "for small translations we can write that @xmath120 and similarly @xmath121 . since this is valid for all small vectors @xmath122",
    "we find from eq.([eq : dn_dv ] ) that @xmath123 this equation relates the gradient of the external potential to the gradient of the ground - state density , and amounts to the static limit of an equation derived for the dynamic density response function by vignale  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a system in which we scale the two - body interaction with a parameter @xmath14 and let us choose the external potential @xmath124 in such a way that the density @xmath125 is the same for all values of @xmath14 . according to the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite such a potential is unique when it exists .",
    "for such a system the density response function will depend on @xmath14 as well and eq.([eq : dndv_grad ] ) becomes @xmath126 let us now consider the limit of very large values of @xmath14 .",
    "one can show , for a general inhomogeneous system , that asymptotically @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the so - called strictly - correlated electron potential @xcite .",
    "the result is intuitively clear as the linearly growing repulsive two - body interaction must be compensated by a linearly growing attactive one - body potential in order to keep the density profile constant .",
    "this has consequences for the behavior of @xmath129 .",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "let us first assume that for @xmath130 the response function @xmath129 attains a finite value @xmath131 . because the left - hand side of eq.([eq : dndv_grad2 ] ) is independent of @xmath14 this implies that @xmath132 which means that the three vector components of @xmath133 must be eigenfunctions of @xmath134 with zero eigenvalue .",
    "since the density response function reaches a finite limit the system does not become rigid even when the interaction becomes infinitely large .",
    "this is a possible situation in systems in which the hamiltonian by a coordinate transformation can be separated in two parts in which one of the parts is weakly dependent on the interaction strength . that such inhomogeneous systems exist",
    "is demonstrated for the harmonic model system described in appendix  [ app : harmonicexample ] and for which we demonstrate that eq.([eq : alfa_func ] ) is indeed valid .",
    "a probably more common situation is that such a separation is either not possible or that both parts of such a hamiltonian are still strongly @xmath14-dependent . in this case",
    "one would expect that the energy required to excite the system grows with @xmath14 , and as such the density response function would vanish for large @xmath14 . if this is the case it is to be expected that @xmath129 in eq.([eq : dndv_grad2 ] ) asymptotically behaves as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a @xmath14-independent function and the terms that follow decay faster than @xmath137 .",
    "this means that for a given perturbation @xmath114 the density response @xmath115 decays as @xmath137 and therefore the strong interaction makes the system more rigid and suppresses density variations .",
    "in such a case eq.([eq : dndv_grad2 ] ) reduces to @xmath138 which is an exact equation for the leading order in @xmath14 .",
    "when we finally consider systems in which the ground - state density and external potential are spatially constant , the reasoning that we carried out does not apply anymore since the gradients in eq.([eq : dndv_grad2 ] ) are identically zero .",
    "however , such systems are homogeneous which implies that the center - of - mass can be separated off and we can therefore expect the response function to attain a finite value in the large interaction limit .",
    "this is exactly the case of our quantum ring model .",
    "indeed we saw in eq.([eq : cm_excitations ] ) that the quantum ring admits excitation energies that are independent of the interaction strength and these correspond to excitations that only change the center - of - mass wave function and do not affect the relative probability distribution of the particles .",
    "as we will see in more detail below , such excitations give a contribution to the density response function that survives in the large interaction limit , while the remaining excitations give a contribution which behaves as in eq.([eq : beta ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to connect this analysis to the @xmath139-sum rule for the dynamic density response function . in a system",
    "where the density is kept independent of @xmath14 with @xmath124 the @xmath139-sum rule attains the form @xcite @xmath140 .",

    "this is not in contradiction with eq.([eq : beta ] ) .",
    "although the density response function itself can become very small for large @xmath14 the integrand in eq.([eq : f_sumrule ] ) can remain finite as it is weighted by the frequency @xmath141 . as a consequence the integral gets contributions proportional to the excitation energies which grow with increasing interaction strength .",
    "after having discussed the general static case , we now turn our attention to the exact dynamical density response function of the quantum ring . inserting a complete set of eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath142 from eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) into the one - dimensional analogue of eq.([eq : dens_rep ] )",

    "we see from eq.([eq : chi_exp ] ) that @xmath162 can be regarded as the discrete fourier transform of @xmath163 with respect to the relative spatial coordinate @xmath164 as was to be expected on the basis of the symmetry of the system .",
    "it will be now convenient to define the spatially discrete and temporally continuous fourier transform of a function @xmath165 and its inverse as : @xmath166 by using this fourier transformation in eq.([eq : denschange ] ) we rewrite the density response as @xmath167 in which @xmath30 is an integer and @xmath141 a continuous variable .",
    "we will make use of this relation below .",
    "we have now obtained an explicit form of the density response function that allows for an analytical analysis in the strong interaction limit .",
    "however , before moving to that , we briefly give the form of the response function for the non - interacting system , i.e. @xmath57 , which in the density functional context will be the same as the kohn - sham response function , since the system has the same density for all values of @xmath33 .",

    "it will therefore mainly have even fourier coefficients which implies that @xmath208 i.e. the density change at antipodal points of the ring is the same . if we however apply a potential with only odd fourier coefficients the density change has the symmetry @xmath209 and is therefore opposite in antipodal points of the ring . from eq.([eq : resp_qlim ] ) we find that the leading term in real space in this case is given by @xmath210 we can understand the dependence on @xmath33 as follows .",
    "the generation of an anti - symmetric antipodal density requires excitation to states with an odd number of nodes in the relative wave function which requires a large energy in the strong interaction limit and therefore the density response is suppressed for large interaction strength . from eq.([eq",

    "the instantaneous nature of the response has a simple explanation .",
    "if we perturb the system with a potential @xmath206 which is only non - zero for frequencies @xmath141 well below the first excitation energy , the temporal variation of the perturbation is much slower than a typical timescale of the free evolution of the system and the density response can be regarded as instantaneous .",
    "since the excitation energies @xmath211 for odd @xmath30 ( which must have odd @xmath37 as well ) increase proportionally to @xmath100 the density response function in this case is well approximated by a frequency independent function for @xmath212 , which explains the instantaneous dependence of the density variation on the perturbation in eq.([eq : dn - odd ] ) .    for even values of @xmath30",

    "for small interactions @xmath215 the exact response function has two poles ; one is approximately at the same location as the kohn - sham response function @xmath216 , while a new pole with a small weight appears at the center - of - mass excitation energy at @xmath217 .",
    "the expansion captures this pole , albeit with a very different weight .",
    "when we increase the interaction strength , the pole originally at the kohn - sham energy will shift to higher energies to a position proportional to @xmath100 , while the pole corresponding to the center - of - mass excitation stays fixed and increases in weight . already at @xmath218 ,",
    "the asymptotic expansion yields good results for this @xmath30-value .",

    "this has interesting consequences for the excitation spectrum . for the excitation energies of the relative mode it implies that @xmath335 while all other excitation energies diverge to infinite values at large interaction strength .",
    "the latter correspond to excitations of the center - of - mass mode .",
    "in contrast to the quantum ring , only the excitation energies of the relative mode remain finite in the large interaction limit which is due to the very different nature of the two - body interaction .",
