    "<S> it is shown experimentally and numerically that when the magnetic resonance is excited by a pump beam , the angular dependence of the third harmonic signal has a local maximum at an incidence angle of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum is shown to be a fingerprint of the antisymmetric distribution of currents in the gold layers . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical model based on the nonlinear dynamics of the electrons inside the gold shows excellent agreement with experimental and numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates the difference in the third harmonic angular pattern at electric and magnetic resonances of the metamaterial . </S>"
