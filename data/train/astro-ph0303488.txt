    "it is now generally agreed that type ia supernovae originate from accreting white dwarfs , and widely accepted that their occurrence signals arrival at the chandrasekhar mass @xmath4 .",
    "however there is no consensus as to how the white dwarf gains mass ( see e.g. livio , 2001 , for a review ) .",
    "two possibilities are currently discussed . in the first",
    ", two white dwarfs merge as their relative orbit shrinks under gravitational radiation ( the double  degenerate scenario ) . in the second possibility",
    ", a white dwarf accretes from a non  degenerate companion ( the single  degenerate scenario ) .",
    "observational evidence is currently too sparse to give a strong preference to either picture .",
    "however both have serious theoretical drawbacks .    for white dwarf mergers , many authors ( saio & nomoto , 1985 , 1998 ; kawai , saio & nomoto , 1987 ; mochkovitch & livio , 1990 ; timmes , woosley & taam , 1994 ; mochkovitch , guerrero & segretain , 1997 ) argue that no explosion takes place and that the result is instead a quiet , accretion ",
    "induced collapse ( aic ) , forming a neutron star .",
    "the single  degenerate picture suffers from two main problems .",
    "first , growth of the white dwarf mass @xmath5 requires efficient nuclear burning of most of the accreted hydrogen .",
    "this happens only for accretion rates @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( nomoto et al .",
    ", 1979 ; fujimoto , 1982 ) . for lower @xmath9",
    "the burning occurs in nova explosions .",
    "these expel matter and leave the white dwarf mass essentially unchanged . for @xmath10",
    "not all of the hydrogen is burnt . in some pictures",
    "much of the excess is expelled in a radiatively driven wind : in e.g. the strong wind solution of hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) the burning rate is limited by @xmath11 .",
    "this allows mass growth to continue , but for @xmath12 this is clearly an inefficient process , as only a small fraction of the transferred mass is gained by the white dwarf .",
    "if there is no significant wind things may be still worse , as the excess accretion will probably form a common envelope around the binary , causing it to merge and become a massive red giant .",
    "the second difficulty with this single  degenerate scenario results from the proximity of a large h ",
    "rich companion at the time the supernova explodes .",
    "this may contaminate the supernova ejecta ( marietta , burrows & fryxell , 2000 ) , in conflict with the defining characteristic of type ia sne as having no detectable hydrogen ( see , however , lentz et al .",
    "2002 ) .    the @xmath9 constraint rules out most candidate progenitor binaries for the single  degenerate scenario .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) generally have mass transfer rates @xmath13 and so are prone to losing the transferred mass in nova explosions .",
    "supersoft x  ray binaries ( sss ) are more promising . here in contrast",
    "to cvs the companion / wd mass ratio @xmath14 is @xmath15 , and mass transfer shrinks the companion s roche lobe relative to the stellar surface . for a companion with a radiative envelope the result is mass transfer on a thermal timescale , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "this is close to the required range if the companion has mass @xmath17 and thus a kelvin ",
    "helmholtz timescale @xmath18  yr ( van den heuvel et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the white dwarf in such sss binaries can gain mass .",
    "however , systematic calculations ( e.g. langer et al . , 2000 ) show that it may be difficult to grow @xmath5 from a typical value @xmath2 all the way to @xmath19 .",
    "thus only systems starting with rather more massive white dwarfs give sne ia .",
    "this in turn means that the main  sequence progenitor of the white dwarf must itself have been rather massive , significantly reducing the number of systems which can give sne ia by this channel .",
    "in addition , this type of evolution is vulnerable to the hydrogen contamination constraint .",
    "not only is the companion fairly massive and hydrogen  rich , its roche lobe offers a large target for the expanding sn shell as the mass ratio @xmath20 must be @xmath15 when the explosion occurs .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the single  degenerate scenario , and offer an alternative that avoids these difficulties .",
    "we have seen that sss binaries do not readily produce sne ia because the white dwarf mass does not grow enough .",
    "the accretion rate is sensitive to the mass ratio @xmath20 , and moves out of the narrow band ( [ burn ] ) in which efficient mass gain occurs before much mass is transferred .",
    "an accretion rate which remains almost constant as @xmath20 decreases is clearly a major advantage for a plausible progenitor wd binary class .",
    "only one type of wd binary satisfies this requirement : long  period ( @xmath21  d ) systems where the wd accretes from a low  mass red giant .",
    "these systems are driven by the nuclear expansion of the red giant .",
    "the helium core mass @xmath22 of this star increases slightly through shell  burning during the binary evolution , causing considerable envelope expansion .",
    "the envelope mass is depleted by shell  burning but much more by mass transfer to the white dwarf .",
    "calculations ( webbink , rappaport & savonije , 1983 ; ritter , 1999 ) show that the mass transfer rate varies remarkably little while most of the companion s envelope is transferred , the value of the rate being fixed by the core mass or equivalently the binary period .",
    "eq ( 36 ) of ritter ( 1999 ) relates @xmath23 directly to the companion mass @xmath24 for the case where all the transferred mass is accreted by the white dwarf .",
    "[ fig : mdot ]     given by eq ( 36 ) of ritter ( 1999 ) plotted as a function of @xmath24 for initial wd and donor masses @xmath25 and various initial donor core masses @xmath26 . ]",
    "must avoid the upper hatched region for the disc to be unstable to dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "the narrow hatched band is the efficient accretion region ( [ burn ] ) .",
    "the assumed duty cycle is 0.004 and the masses of donor , core and white dwarf at the start of this phase are 0.53@xmath27 , 0.2@xmath27 and 1.1@xmath27 respectively . ]    .",
    "evolution of the donor core and envelope masses , and the white dwarf mass .",
    "after @xmath28 years the white dwarf reaches the chandrasekhar mass and a type ia supernova ensues . ]    shows that for a wd starting at @xmath29 the mass transfer rate @xmath23 changes by no more than factors @xmath30 as @xmath24 decreases from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .    while this is encouraging for a candidate sne ia progenitor there appears at first sight to be a major difficulty .",
    "the mass transfer rates in such binaries are typically only @xmath33 , more than a factor 10 short of the steady burning regime ( [ burn ] )",
    ". however we must distinguish the mass _ transfer _ rate @xmath23 from the mass _ accretion _ rate @xmath9 .",
    "all these long  period systems are so wide that their accretion discs have ionization zones ; they are dwarf novae ( king et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "this point was previously neglected but is crucial for modeling these long  period systems correctly .",
    "it is probably the shortness of the duty cycle @xmath34 , together with the low space density resulting from their relatively rapid evolution that makes discovery of long  period systems of this type difficult .",
    "accretion on to the white dwarf occurs almost entirely during outbursts , with accretion rates @xmath35 which can therefore be close to the efficient burning regime .",
    "the mean duty cycle @xmath34 is presumably itself a function of the evolutionary state of the binary , although the lack of understanding of disc viscosity in current theory does not allow one to predict it with any certainty .",
    "however for typical values @xmath36 to a few times @xmath37 one can always find initial white dwarf , donor and core masses which keep the accretion rate during outbursts inside the efficient burning regime ( [ burn ] ) through most of the evolution .",
    "this kind of mass gain therefore works even if wind loss is inefficient for @xmath38 . figs .",
    "[ fig : rgbtracks1 ] , [ fig : rgbtracks2 ] show a case where @xmath5 is able to grow to @xmath19 .",
    "a further advantage for this picture is that the sn ia explosion must always occur for mass ratios @xmath39 , and indeed generally with very little of the hydrogen envelope of the secondary remaining .",
    "this then avoids the second difficulty ( hydrogen contamination ) afflicting the single  degenerate scenario .",
    "the secondary is now a rather smaller target for the expanding supernova shell , and in any case contains little hydrogen .",
    "we have seen from the previous section that long  period dwarf novae offer a route for making sne ia .",
    "[ fig : progenitors ]    .",
    "the precise value depends on the core mass at this stage , which must be in the approximate range 0.20.3@xmath27 , and the details of mass loss for @xmath40 . ]",
    "gives the regions of @xmath41  space where growth to @xmath19 may be possible .",
    "( this figure assumes conservative mass transfer , but we will show in a future paper that similar results are obtained when this assumption is relaxed . ) the required @xmath42 is somewhat higher than typically results from single  star evolution .",
    "this might seem to lead to the same need for massive main  sequence progenitors and thus the same restriction on progenitor numbers as for the sss channel .",
    "however the nuclear  driven evolution discussed here is of course also open to the outcomes of thermal  timescale mass transfer , i.e. the sss systems we discussed earlier . many of these , starting from typical white dwarf masses @xmath43 , have already increased them to values of the order required in fig . [ fig : progenitors ] . we therefore envisage a two  stage process in the growth of @xmath5 towards @xmath19 ( fig . [",
    "fig : ttmt ] ) .",
    "first , a sss system with @xmath44 and @xmath45 undergoes thermal  timescale mass transfer and increases the white dwarf mass to values @xmath46 .",
    "timescale mass transfer stops once the mass ratio @xmath20 drops below a value @xmath47 .",
    "what happens next to the binary depends on the competition between orbital angular momentum loss ( presumably through magnetic stellar wind braking ) and nuclear expansion of the secondary ( cf schenker et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "if the angular momentum loss timescale is shorter than that for nuclear evolution the system becomes a short  period cv , often with some signs of chemical evolution as in ae aquarii ( schenker et al . 2002 ) . if instead the nuclear evolution timescale is shorter , the system will expand and eventually become the kind of long  period cv we discuss here .",
    "for suitable masses",
    "@xmath41 and orbital separation at the end of thermal  timescale mass transfer the white dwarf mass can grow to @xmath19 and produce a sn ia .    assuming mass transfer starts at or near the end of the main sequence and that the thermal  timescale phase has little effect on the core mass of the donor when it reaches the base of the rgb , the minimum donor mass which reaches the rgb with core mass @xmath48 is @xmath49 . for massive donors ( mass ratios @xmath5034 ) sustained thermal ",
    "timescale mass transfer leads to dynamical instability ( hjellming 1989 ; kalogera & webbink 1996 ; kolb et al .",
    ". this _ delayed dynamical instability _ limits the maximum donor mass before the thermal  timescale phase to @xmath51 .",
    "thus the donor mass at the start of mass transfer is limited to the approximate range 2  3@xmath27",
    ". future work involving accurate numerical modelling of the thermal  timescale evolution will refine this simple picture .",
    "we have shown that long  period dwarf novae offer a promising channel for making type ia supernovae .",
    "in particular the white dwarf mass can be raised to the chandrasekhar value without the need to invoke fairly massive and thus rare main  sequence progenitors .",
    "moreover there is very little danger of hydrogen contamination of the supernova ejecta .    clearly more work is needed .",
    "in particular we need to calculate the birthrate of such systems and compare this with the inferred rate @xmath52 of sne ia per galaxy .",
    "this in turn requires an extensive grid of models .",
    "we shall return to this problem in a future paper .",
