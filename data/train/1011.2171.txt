    "relativistic shocks accelerate plasma to ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "emission from such shocks is observed in astrophysical sources on many length , time and energy scales , and is typically attributed to the synchrotron process .",
    "the composition of the plasma , the magnitude of the preshock magnetic field , and the lorentz factor of the shock are generally unknown .",
    "one of the best - studied systems is the radiative afterglow that follows the bright flash of @xmath0-rays in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the structure of the emitting region can be modeled from the observed emission : in the standard grb afterglow model ( e.g. , piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) , the radiation is produced in a relativistic blastwave shell propagating into a weakly magnetized plasma .",
    "detailed studies of grb spectra and light curves have shown that the magnetic energy density in the emitting region is a fraction @xmath1 of the internal energy density ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar 2002 , yost et al .",
    "2003 ; panaitescu 2005 ) .",
    "however , simple compressional amplification of the weak pre - existing magnetic field of the circumburst medium can not account for such high magnetization ( gruzinov 2001 ) .",
    "the leading hypothesis for field amplification in grb afterglows is the relativistic weibel instability that produces filamentary currents aligned with the shock normal ; these currents are responsible for the creation of transverse magnetic fields ( e.g. , gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "recent plasma simulations using the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method have demonstrated magnetic - field generation in relativistic collisionless shocks ( e.g. , nishikawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2009 ; spitkovsky 2008 ) .",
    "however , the size of the simulated regions is orders of magnitude smaller than the grb emission region .",
    "it remains unclear whether magnetic fields generated on scales of tens of plasma skin depths will persist at sufficient strength in the entire emission region , some @xmath2 plasma skin depths in size . on the other hand , in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes ,",
    "if the density of the preshock medium is strongly inhomogeneous , significant vorticity is produced in the shock transition that stretches and deforms magnetic field lines leading to field amplification ( goodman & macfadyen 2007 ; sironi & goodman 2007 ; palma et al .",
    "for the long duration grbs , i.e. , associated with the iron core collapse of mass - losing very massive stars , density fluctuations in the interstellar medium may arise through several processes ( e.g. , sironi & goodman 2007 ) .",
    "there is also a direct observational motivation for relativistic turbulence in grb outflows .",
    "significant angular fluctuations by relativistic turbulence have been invoked to explain the large variation of the @xmath0-ray luminosity among bursts as well as the intraburst variability observed in many afterglows .",
    "the afterglow polarization indicates a breaking of axial symmetry ; the correlation of this polarization with large - amplitude variability suggests blastwave anisotropy as the source of variability .",
    "narayan & kumar ( 2009 ) and lazar et al . (",
    "2009 ) have proposed a relativistic turbulence model instead of the well - known internal shock model as the production mechanism for variable grb light curves and applied it to grb 080319b ( kumar & narayan 2009 ) .",
    "zhang & yan ( 2010 ) have developed a new grb prompt - emission model in the highly magnetized regime , namely , an internal - collision - induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence ( icmart ) model . within this model the short - time variability `` spikes ''",
    "are related to turbulence in the magnetic dissipation region while the broad variability component in the grb lightcurves is related to central engine activity .",
    "the innermost parts of the relativistic jets seen in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are explored by multi - wavelength observational campaigns that provide probes into the structure of the blazar zone ( e.g. , marscher et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "recently correlated x - ray / tev gamma - ray flares with timescales from 15 minutes ( mrk 421 ) to a few hours ( mrk 501 and 1es 1959 + 650 ) have been observed ( aharonian et al .  2003 ; albert et al .  2007 ; krawczynski et al .",
    "the fast variable flares may come from small regions , a few schwarzschild radii in size .",
    "several authors have proposed fast - moving needles within a slower jet or a jet - within - a - jet scenario to explain the fast variability of blazars ( levinson 2007 ; begelman et al .",
    "2008 ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ; giannios et al .",
    "on the other hand , marscher & jorstad ( 2010 ) have proposed that some short - term fluctuations can be understood as the consequence of a turbulent ambient - jet - plasma that passes through shocks in the jet flow ( marscher et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are bound by an expanding nonrelativistic spherical blastwave .",
    "the synchrotron emission from snrs is generally consistent with compression of the interstellar field .",
    "however , recent discovery of the year - scale variability in the synchrotron x - ray emission of snrs suggests that the magnetic field needs to be amplified in the snr up to the milli - gauss level ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2007 , uchiyama & aharonian 2008 ) , although the interpretation is disputed ( e.g. , bykov et al .  2008 , huang & pohl 2008 ) .",
    "the evidence for magnetic field amplification in snrs has been obtained also from the thickness of x - ray filaments that typically indicate @xmath3 micro - gauss magnetic fields ( bamba et al .",
    "2003 , 2005a , 2005b ; vink & laming 2003 , but see also pohl et al .",
    "since the typical magnetic - field strength in the interstellar medium is on the order of a few micro - gauss , amplification beyond simple shock compression is necessary to achieve a milli - gauss level magnetic field in snrs .",
    "recently , giacalone & jokipii ( 2007 ) have performed non - relativistic mhd shock simulations including density fluctuations with a kolmogorov power spectrum in the preshock medium .",
    "they observed a strong magnetic - field amplification caused by turbulence in the postshock medium ; the final rms magnetic - field strength is reportedly a hundred times larger than the preshock field strength .",
    "density fluctuations with a kolmogorov power spectrum would be present in the preshock medium from the transonic turbulence expected in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , hennebelle & audit 2007 , inoue & inutsuka 2008 , inoue et al .",
    "inoue et al .  (",
    "2009 ) have also obtained strong magnetic - field amplification by turbulence associated with a strong thermal instability driven shock wave propagating through an inhomogeneous interstellar two - phase medium .",
    "the interaction of snrs with a turbulent , magnetized ism has been studied by balsara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) via three - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "they found that the interaction of strong shocks with the turbulent density fluctuations could be a strong source of helicity generation which provides a potential source of magnetic field amplification .",
    "kim et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied the energetics , structure , and spectra of a supernova ( sn ) driven turbulent medium with higher resolution simulations .",
    "balsara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have investigated in detail the role of magnetic field amplification in sn - driven turbulence and found that the helicity generation mechanism by sn - driven , turbulent , multiphase ism processes was adequate to sustain the magnetic field growth ( also balsara & kim 2005 ; kim & balsara 2006 ) .",
    "haugen et al .  (",
    "2004 ) have performed simulations and found that magnetic field amplification can be sustained by shock - driven turbulence in an isothermal , compressible , shock - driven medium .",
    "all the above simulations are relevant to snr shocks , which are non - relativistic .",
    "grbs and agn jets have relativistic shocks .",
    "similar physical processes should apply , so that these shocks would also experience strong magnetic - field amplification by turbulence .",
    "the magnetic - field amplification mechanism is by a so - called turbulent dynamo or small - scale dynamo , also known as a fast dynamo , and is different from the classical mean - field dynamo mechanism .",
    "mean - field dynamo theory ( e.g. , steenbeck et al .",
    "1966 ; parker 1971 ; ruzmaikin et al .",
    "1988 , diamond et al .",
    "2005 ) has been used to study the growth of the large - scale magnetic field in our galaxy . in general , mean - field dynamos are slow , involve almost incompressible motions , and the growth rate decreases with decreasing resistivity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "kulsrud & anderson ( 1992 ) pointed out that the magnetic reynolds number ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is typical length of flow ) in our galaxy is very large ( @xmath7 ) , and such a high @xmath8 leads to the development of turbulent velocity and magnetic - field fluctuations on small scales .",
    "while the growth of large - scale magnetic fields is probably driven by a mechanism similar to a mean - field dynamo , other mechanisms are likely responsible for the more rapid generation of field on smaller scales .",
    "the theory of fast dynamos has been developed to investigate the rapid growth of magnetic field on smaller scales in the limit of infinite magnetic reynolds number , and the growth rate does not depend on resistivity ( e.g. , childress & gilbert 1995 ; galloway 2003 ; brandenburg & subamanian 2005 ) . here",
    "the amplification of the magnetic field arises from sequences of a `` stretch , twist , and fold '' nature .",
    "while the limit ( @xmath9 ) is unrealistic in astrophysical simulations , published results of incompressible mhd simulations ( e.g. , schekochihin et al .",
    "2004 ) and compressible mhd simulations ( e.g. , balsara et al .",
    "2004 ; balsara & kim 2005 ; kim & balsara 2006 ) are nevertheless in agreement with the existence of a small - scale turbulent driven dynamo .    here",
    "we report on magnetic - field amplification by turbulence in two - dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( rmhd ) simulations of a mildly relativistic shock wave propagating through an inhomogeneous medium . in this paper",
    "we focus on the small - scale growth of the magnetic field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we describe the numerical method and setup used for our simulations in  2 , present our results in  3 , and discuss the astrophysical implications in  4 .",
    "to study the time evolution of a mildly relativistic shock propagating in an inhomogeneous medium , we use the 3d grmhd code `` raishin '' in two - dimensional cartesian geometry ( @xmath10 plane ) .",
    "raishin is based on a @xmath11 formalism of the general relativistic conservation laws of particle number and energy - momentum , maxwell s equations , and ohm s law with no electrical resistance ( ideal mhd condition ) in a curved spacetime ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the raishin code , a conservative , high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) scheme is employed .",
    "the numerical fluxes are calculated using the hll approximate riemann solver , and flux - interpolated constrained transport ( flux - ct ) is used to maintain a divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "the raishin code performs special relativistic calculations in minkowski spacetime by choosing the appropriate metric .",
    "raishin has proven to be accurate to second order and has passed a number of one - dimensional and multidimensional numerical tests including highly relativistic cases and highly magnetized cases in both special and general relativity ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006 ; mizuno et al .",
    "we have improved the reconstruction schemes in the raishin code to handle the turbulent structure more finely . a fifth - order",
    "weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno , jiang & shu 1996 ) scheme is built into the code and used in the simulations .",
    "weno schemes provide highly - accurate solutions in regions of smooth flow and non - oscillatory transitions in the presence of discontinuous waves by combining different interpolation stencils of order @xmath12 into a weighted average of order @xmath13 .    at the beginning of the simulations , an inhomogeneous plasma with mean",

    "these ripples in the shock front introduce rotation and vorticity in the postshock region through a process similar to the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( e.g. , brouillette 2002 ) .",

    "this ratio increases with time in all cases .",
    "the electromagnetic energy is large at small scales but the kinetic energy remains dominant at all scales , because magnetic - field amplification by turbulence has not yet saturated .",

    "each fluctuating magnetic field component grows similarly , implying that the turbulence amplifies each magnetic field component equally .",
    "the growth rate is independent of the original magnetic - field direction .",
    "therefore , the amplification of magnetic field by turbulent motion does not depend on the direction of a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we should note that this magnetic field fluctuation amplitude is normalized by the mean magnetic field in the postshock region , which is about 3 times larger in the perpendicular - field case than in the parallel - field case on account of magnetic field compression by the shock .",
    "therefore , the total magnetic - field amplification is larger for a perpendicular homogeneous field .",
    "we have performed two - dimensional relativistic mhd simulations of the propagation of a mildly relativistic shock through an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "we have shown that the postshock region becomes turbulent owing to the preshock density inhomogeneity , and the magnetic field is strongly amplified by the turbulent motion in the postshock region .",

    "the mean magnetic field strength in the postshock region is still increasing when the simulations were terminated .",
    "therefore , longer simulations with a longer simulation box are needed to follow the magnetic field amplification to saturation .",
    "in this paper we have performed simulations in two - dimensional geometry as a first step toward understanding magnetic - field amplification by turbulence in the relativistic mhd regime . however , in general the turbulence structure , for example the slope of the kolmogorov - like power spectrum , is different in two and three dimensions . to more realistically analyze three - dimensional phenomena , we will extend the current investigation to three - dimensional simulations in future work .",
    "recently , the fermi satellite observed grb 080916c which showed a featureless smoothly - joint broken power - law spectra covering 6 - 7 decades in energy ( abdo et al .",
    "zhang & peer ( 2009 ) analyzed this burst in detail and argued that the non - detection of a thermal component strongly suggests that the outflow is poynting - flux dominated with magnetization @xmath118 ( the poynting - to - kinetic energy ratio ) at the central engine .",
    "therefore , at least some grb outflows appear to be magnetically dominated . in our simulations , we assume the preshock medium is weakly magnetized .",
    "if we consider internal shocks in grbs , which are internal collisions within relativistically propagating shells , the magnetization in the preshock medium can cover a wide range of values .",
    "in particular , it is expected that in the strongly - magnetized ( high @xmath119 ) regime the mhd turbulence is anisotropic and has a different scaling in the directions along and perpendicular to the homogeneous field , @xmath120 ( kolmogorov - type ) and @xmath121 ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; cho & lazarian 2003 ) .",
    "while the kinetic power in the turbulence quickly decreases with @xmath20 , the power in the magnetic field does not significantly decrease with @xmath20 . as a result ,",
    "eddies of smaller scales are more stretched and appear elongated along the magnetic field .",
    "current simulations do not show any anisotropy because the magnetic field in the turbulent postshock medium is still weak .",
    "mhd turbulence in the highly - magnetized ( high @xmath119 ) regime is not well studied .",
    "a comprehensive study of relativistic turbulence with a wide range of magnetization is now underway and will be presented in future publications .    in the internal shock model",
    ", the grb central engine ejects an unsteady outflow that can be visualized as discrete magnetized shells with variable lorentz factor and mass loading .",
    "these magnetized shells collide with each other at the conventional internal shock radius , @xmath122 cm , where @xmath123 . hereafter the convention @xmath124 .",
    "the gamma - ray emission radius @xmath125 can be in principle in the range of @xmath126-@xmath127 cm ( between the photosphere radius and the external shock deceleration radius ) .",
    "various observational constraints suggest that the non - thermal emission radius is at @xmath128 cm ( e.g. , kumar et al . 2007 ; racusin et al .",
    "2008 ; shen & zhang 2009 ; zhang & peer 2009 ) .",
    "the thickness of the discrete shell is @xmath129 cm in the comoving frame . from a turbulence model of grbs ( narayan & kumar 2009 ; lazar et al .",
    "2009 ) , the size of an eddy in the comoving frame is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is a filling factor and @xmath132 is a random lorentz factor for an energy - bearing eddy .",
    "lazar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that @xmath133 is between 2 and 3 .",
    "narayan & kumar ( 2009 ) have pointed out that @xmath134 if one requires that the eddies be of the maximal causally allowed size .",
    "our simulation results show that eddies have different sizes and randomly oriented flow directions .",
    "clearly @xmath135 will be very small .",
    "there is a question as to whether a fluid treatment of the grb plasma is justified .",
    "the same question arises in supernova remnants , to which the standard answer is that magnetization of the plasma ensures a short effective mean free path . from the detailed discussion in zhang & yan ( 2010 ) , the strong collision radius for coulomb collisions",
    "may be defined by @xmath136 so that @xmath137 .",
    "the comoving collision mean free path of electrons can be estimated as @xmath138 cm , where @xmath139 is the electron number density in the comoving frame . in order to have the plasma in the collisional regime , one needs to require @xmath140 .",
    "therefore grb shocks must be collisionless .",
    "however , the grb fluid stays together through magnetic interactions .",
    "a more relevant mean free path would be a magnetic gyro - radius and plasma skin depth .",
    "the gyro(cyclotron)-radii in the comoving frame are @xmath141 cm for electrons ( where @xmath142 is the electron lorentz factor and @xmath143 is the comoving magnetic field strength ) , and @xmath144 cm for protons ( where @xmath145 is the proton lorentz factor ) .",
    "the comoving relativistic plasma skin depths are @xmath146 cm for electrons , and @xmath147 cm for protons . here",
    "@xmath148 and @xmath149 denote the mean lorentz factor of the relativistic electrons and protons , respectively . physically , plasma skin depths are relevant to non - magnetized ejecta . for magnetized ejecta ,",
    "the plasma skin depths are relevant in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the gyro - radii are more relevant in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "both magnetic gyro - radii and plasma skin depths are @xmath150 .",
    "therefore this justifies a fluid treatment of the grb plasma .",
    "our simulations show filamentary magnetic - field structure .",
    "a turbulent plasma with fast - moving magnetic filaments is likely a site for second order fermi acceleration of charged particles and a source of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the spatial variability and large fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic field also have implications for nonthermal radiation with possibly observable consequences .",
    "a simple light curve ( the variability amplitude ) can be obtained from integrating @xmath151 with respect to the light of sight measured in the laboratory frame over the postshock region as a proxy of the electron emissivity . within the grb context",
    ", turbulence - powered lightcurves were calculated by narayan & kumar ( 2009 ) and lazar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . in their calculations ,",
    "the relativistic turbulent eddies have a characteristic lorentz factor , and the electron emissivity can be characterized by @xmath152 along with a lorentz boost due to the turbulent motion . as a result , the lightcurve shows a peak when an eddy enters into the line of sight ( similar to synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "this can produce significant variability . in our case ,",
    "the turbulence is mildly relativistic , so that at any epoch , one sees the contribution from many eddies since the lorentz boost eddy effect is not significant . for our current simulations we would expect the eddy emission to average out , and as a result we would expect a roughly flat lightcurve without significant variability . a self - consistent calculation of nonthermal radiation , which includes the acceleration of nonthermal electrons and the amplification of magnetic fields would be highly valuable .",
