    "an interesting feature of magnetic monopoles in gauge theories is that they can catalyse nucleon decay at strong interaction rate @xcite .",
    "the actual computation of the monopole catalysis cross section remains , however , an open problem .",
    "this computation would involve long - distance physics of two different kinds  quark - monopole interactions and qcd phenomena  and also short - distance physics responsible for baryon number non - conservation .",
    "most of the relevant effects are non - perturbative , and this makes even a semi - qualitative calculation difficult .",
    "an approach to this problem was suggested in ref .",
    "it was proposed to invoke the skyrme model of a nucleon @xcite which indeed works reasonably well in describing low energy properties of baryons @xcite . in the skyrme model ,",
    "the nucleon is essentially a classical field theory object , a soliton .",
    "given that the t  hooft  polyakov monopole is also a soliton , the monopole - nucleon interactions are then possible to describe at the level of classical field theory .    in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , the monopole is treated as point - like .",
    "the non - conservation of baryon number comes in through the boundary condition imposed on the skyrme field at the monopole centre , i.e. , at the singularity .",
    "it is not entirely obvious whether concrete mechanisms of baryon number non - conservation indeed produce , in the limit of vanishing monopole size , the conjectured boundary condition . also , dealing with the singularity and the boundary condition imposed at the singularity may be inconvenient for numerical computations .",
    "one more complication inherent in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite stems from the fact that the spherically symmetric skyrme field in the monopole background corresponds to an electrically charged object ( `` proton '' ) , so one has to explicitly introduce leptons to make baryon number violation consistent with electric charge conservation .    in this paper",
    "we present a simplified model where both monopole and skyrmion are smooth solutions of the classical field equations , the baryon number non - conservation is explicitly built in and is due to the classical analogue @xcite of the triangle anomaly , and there is no necessity to consider leptons .",
    "the price to pay is that the skyrme field in the presence of the monopole does not carry net electric charge , so our model mimicks the monopole catalysed decay of a neutron , rather than a proton .",
    "we shall concentrate on two aspects of our model .",
    "first , we study whether or not the baryon number non - conservation proceeds without suppression at the classical level . for this we shall have to consider a region near the monopole core .",
    "of course , it is not realistic to use the non - linear sigma model for describing physics near the core , but this step is inevitable in the classical calculation of monopole catalysis . by carrying out numerical analysis ,",
    "we show that there are no states with non - zero baryon number on top of the t  hooft  polyakov monopole , irrespectively of the size of the monopole core , i.e. , monopole catalysis of nucleon decay indeed takes place .",
    "second , we find that the regime of `` point - like '' monopole sets in when the two scales , responsible for the sizes and masses of the monopole and skyrmion , respectively , are not yet widely different : our results are stable when the ratio of monopole and skyrmion sizes is below 0.03 , and the mass ratio is below 1 .",
    "this is a good sign for future numerical analysis of the skyrmion decay in skyrmion - monopole collisions .",
    "hence , our model may be a reasonable starting point for a semi - realistic calculation of the monopole catalysis cross section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our model in section 2 . to set the stage , we recapitulate the properties of the monopole and the skyrmion in section 3 . section 4 contains our main results , both analytical and numerical .",
    "we present concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "to motivate our model , we recall first that the simplest theory incorporating skyrmions has @xmath0 global symmetry and contains the sigma field @xmath1 taking values in @xmath2 .",
    "we wish to introduce baryon number non - conservation through the classical anomaly in the baryonic current",
    ". the baryon number will be anomalous if @xmath3 or @xmath4 or both are gauged .",
    "the model should also possess magnetic monopoles ; if we do not extend the symmetry group , the monopoles are to be associated with the gauged ( part of ) @xmath0 .",
    "gauging @xmath3 alone is not sufficient : in that case the skyrme field would break the gauge group completely , no electromagnetic @xmath5 would be left unbroken , and there would be no magnetic monopoles .",
    "so , we come to fully gauged @xmath0 with gauge potentials @xmath6 @xmath7 realistic monopoles have very small sizes , so we have to break the non - abelian symmetry down to an abelian subgroup at a high energy scale .",
    "thus , we introduce two higgs triplets @xmath8 and @xmath9 in @xmath10 and @xmath11 representations , respectively",
    ". these break @xmath0 down to @xmath12 .",
    "the electromagnetic group is the vectorial subgroup of this @xmath12 , so we have to break axial @xmath5 at some point . for simplicity , we consider the minimal option , i.e. , we do not introduce extra higgs fields",
    ". then the axial @xmath5 is broken by the skyrme field itself .",
    "the existence of a relatively long - ranged axial gauge field is an unrealistic feature of our model ; however , in this paper we study the dynamics near the monopole core , so it will not be important whether or not the axial @xmath5 is truly long ranged .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our model by introducing yet another higgs field which would break the axial @xmath5 , but not the electromagnetic subgroup .",
    "to summarise , our model has @xmath0 gauge symmetry , with the skyrme field and two higgs fields in the following representations @xmath13 to simplify the calculations , we take the gauge couplings , higgs self - couplings and vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields the same in the left and right sectors , @xmath14 the action for this model is @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\    & - & \\int~d^4x~\\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\mbox{tr}(d_{\\mu}\\phi_a)^2 +   \\frac{1}{2 } \\mbox{tr}(d_{\\mu}\\phi_b)^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - &   \\int~d^4x~\\left [ \\frac{\\lambda}{8 }   \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } \\mbox{tr}(\\phi_a^2 ) + v^2\\right)^2 +   \\frac{{\\lambda}}{8 }   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{tr}(\\phi_b^2 ) + v^2\\right)^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\int~d^4x~\\left [    - \\frac{f_{\\pi}^2}{16 } \\mbox{tr}(u^{\\dagger } d_{\\mu } u)^2   +   \\frac{1}{32e^2}\\mbox{tr}([u^{\\dagger}d_{\\mu}u , u^{\\dagger}d_{\\nu}u]^2 ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\gamma_{wzw } \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the field strengths of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath20 matrices from the algebras of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ d_{\\mu } \\phi_b & = &        \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_b + [ b_{\\mu } , \\phi_b]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the pion decay constant and the skyrme constant , respectively . the last term in eq .",

    "one may doubt that the system can actualy travel along this path in configuration space : in the gauge @xmath48 , the kinetic energy contains a term @xmath169 which diverges if @xmath94 changes in time .",
    "also , the baryonic current ( [ 8 ] ) has spatial components whose asymptotics at large @xmath138 ( again in the gauge @xmath170 ) are @xmath171 for @xmath172 , there is the baryonic flux at @xmath173 , @xmath174 this may seem to indicate that the bayon number leaks to spatial infinity .",
    "certainly , an evolution with infinite kinetic energy is impossible , so in the gauge @xmath48 the asymptotic value @xmath94 can not change in time . to see how , in this gauge",
    ", the system can travel along the path with varying baryon number ( say , leading from @xmath143 to @xmath175 ) , one has first to transform each constrained solution of our family to a gauge in which @xmath141 rapidly tends to zero as @xmath173 .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ restgauge ] ) , ( [ a * * ] ) , each configuration of the new family will have non - vanishing @xmath83 , so that at large @xmath58 @xmath176 because of gauge invariance , the baryon numbers and energies of old and new configurations will be the same .",
    "travelling along the new path in the configuration space does not cost infinite kinetic energy .",
    "indeed , in the gauge @xmath177 , the electric field at large @xmath138 behaves as @xmath178 and the integral of @xmath179 converges .",
    "also , the baryonic current ( [ q * ] ) vanishes as @xmath173 , so the baryon number does not leak to spatial infinity .",
    "it merely disappears .",
