    "the potential for an atom in a magnetic field is given by :    @xmath35    with @xmath36 the magnetic quantum number , @xmath37 the land factor and @xmath38 the bohr magneton .",
    "if we make a harmonic approximation around the potential minimum we find that the trap frequencies are given by :    @xmath39    with @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the eigenvalues of @xmath31 and @xmath42 the mass of the atom . here",

    "having established that stationary points , including ip traps , can only be found on the manifold @xmath1 , we now address the question whether a ip trap can be created in any arbitrary point on the manifold @xmath1 . for convenience",
    "we choose a coordinate frame that diagonalizes @xmath14 , such that the zero eigenvector lies along coordinate direction @xmath45 .",
    "the gradient tensor then takes a very simple form , with @xmath46 as the only nonzero components .",
    "since @xmath28 must be chosen along the zero eigenvector , we write @xmath47 .",

    "thus @xmath31 depends on a single parameter @xmath48 that is a multiplier of the symmetric and traceless tensor @xmath49 .",
    "we can easily see the qualitative behavior of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath48 . obviously , for @xmath50 the eigenvalues are @xmath51 . for small values of @xmath48 we can use perturbation theory to obtain the lowest eigenvalue to first order , yielding t_3 u_3 c_333 .",
    "this shows that @xmath52 can be made either positive or negative by choosing the sign of @xmath48 . for small values of @xmath48 the other two eigenvalues will remain positive",
    "this means that for small @xmath48 the stationary point will be either a ip trap or a saddle point with morse index of 1 , morse index being the number of negative eigenvalues .",
    "note that we can only make a ip trap if @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , for the case that @xmath54 a counterexample is easily found .    for large enough positive or negative values of @xmath48 the term @xmath49 will become the dominant term . since @xmath49 is traceless",
    ", it has signature @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "therefore for large values of @xmath48 we will always have a saddle point .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 will determine whether the morse index is 1 or 2 .",
    "since for small @xmath48 the eigenvalues of @xmath31 are given by @xmath57 , we can tune the two non axial trap frequencies with @xmath48 but the axial frequency is fixed by @xmath58 [ eq .",
    "( [ eqtrapfreqs ] ) ] .",
    "we now investigate how stationary points can be moved over the manifold by changing the uniform field @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the situation that the spatial dependence of the magnetic field is defined , e.g. , by a configuration of permanent magnets .",
    "we can influence the magnetic field pattern by applying a uniform external field . in terms of the above quantities , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "are fixed , @xmath28 is our control parameter .",
    "the movement of ip traps , which must clearly be constrained to the manifold , is important in applications that require trapped atoms to move , such as beam splitters and conveyor belts @xcite .",
    "we now calculate a displacement tensor @xmath59 in a stationary point @xmath60 on the manifold .",
    "this tensor describes how the position of a stationary point moves when the uniform field is changed . to calculate it",
    ", we use the condition for a stationary point , @xmath61 , with @xmath7 as in eq .",
    "( [ uexpand ] ) , @xmath62 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath63 and setting @xmath60 , we solve for @xmath64 and find :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 denotes the inverse tensor of @xmath67 .",
    "in the basis where @xmath68 is diagonal we see that @xmath69 , i.e. , a small field in the axial direction of a ip trap will not displace it .",
    "since this means that the eigenvalue @xmath70 is zero , @xmath64 is singular .",
    "therefore @xmath64 is a mapping of a three - dimensional vector @xmath63 onto a two - dimensional space , namely the tangential plane to the manifold .",
    "it is spanned by the two eigenvectors @xmath71,@xmath72 corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "the vector @xmath73 is normal to the manifold and is found to be proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "note that during the movement the radial trap frequencies can be controlled using a bias field in the axial direction of the ip trap [ eq .  ( [ eqtrapfreqs ] ) ] .",
    "the manifold @xmath1 is not only a powerful concept in the description of stationary points , it also has significance in the occurrence and movement of field zeroes .",
    "such points of zero field are also minima of @xmath0 and can thus serve as atom traps .",
    "however , these so - called quadrupole traps ( qt ) suffer from higher trap loss rates due to majorana spin flips near the region of zero field .",
    "the movement of qts is important in loading procedures , i.e. to transport atoms into the final ip trap . in this section",
    "we investigate how field zeroes can be moved and what happens when they approach the manifold .",
    "the manifold is the boundary between two regions of space @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "since @xmath14 is traceless , and @xmath79 is the product of the eigenvalues , @xmath14 must have two negative and one positive eigenvalues in @xmath75 . similarly",
    ", in @xmath76 it has one negative and two positive eigenvalues .",
    "it is impossible to move between the two regions @xmath75 , @xmath76 without one of the eigenvalues going through zero .",
    "this means that the manifold imposes restrictions on the movement of field minima that have a field zero .      since a quadrupole trap is a zero of the magnetic field , it is straightforward to give a prescription for how to move it by applying an external field .",
    "we call the stationary field @xmath80 and the desired trajectory @xmath81 . in order to move the field zero along the trajectory ,",
    "all we need to do is to use the external field @xmath82 to cancel the local magnetic field , _ ( t)=-_((t ) ) .    like for the movement of stationary points",
    ", we can also express the movement of zeroes in terms of a displacement tensor @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ moveip ] ) . for field zeroes",
    "this tensor takes a very simple form , @xmath84 thus , generally speaking , field zeroes do not disappear when the uniform field @xmath85 is changed , they simply move through 3d space .",
    "the situation is different when a field zero approaches the manifold between the regions @xmath75 , @xmath76 . on the manifold",
    "@xmath86 so that @xmath64 does not exist .",
    "in fact , since one of the eigenvalues of @xmath14 vanishes , the magnetic confinement along one direction of the magnetic qt vanishes .",
    "having established how field zeroes ( qts ) and ip traps move , the natural question arises what happens when a field zero approaches the manifold .",
    "we have just noted that field zeroes can be broadly categorized in two types , according to whether the signature of the gradient is @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that the approach of the manifold by a field zero is accompanied by the approach by another field zero , of the opposite type , from the other side of the manifold .",
    "if a zero is sufficiently close to @xmath1 , we first assume that we can choose a point @xmath24 on @xmath1 such that the position of the zero @xmath87 is in the direction @xmath88 of the local quadrupole axis .",
    "thus we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore @xmath91 on @xmath1 so that the requirement of zero field in @xmath92 simplifies to @xmath93 this shows immediately that the replacement @xmath94 yields another zero .",
    "the two zeroes are symmetrically placed around the point on @xmath1 , in the direction of the @xmath88 axis .",
    "the zeroes must be of opposite type , since they are on opposite sides of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we note that the solution for @xmath95 of the above eq .",
    "( [ zeropairs ] ) , namely @xmath96 implies that the local field direction @xmath28 must be proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "this is just the normal vector to the manifold as mentioned above , so the local field @xmath28 is normal to the manifold @xmath1 .    the choice of a point @xmath24 on @xmath1 such that @xmath98 is possible unless @xmath88 is parallel to the manifold . in this special case , where @xmath54 , a zero arriving on the manifold can transform into a line of zero field , which lies entirely on the manifold .",
    "such lines of zero require a treatment that goes beyond the second order field expansion .",
    "evidence from numerical examples and some highly symmetric analytical examples suggests that such lines are closed loops on the manifold .",
    "small perturbing fields can split this loop into a number of zero pairs , which can be macroscopically separated .",
    "finally we can also address the question whether the merging of field zeroes must necessarily take place on @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that two field zeroes are sufficiently close so that it is sufficient to expand the field upto second order .",
    "we define local coordinates @xmath11 around the first zero and @xmath99 around the other . for the field expansion we can then write @xmath100 note that both @xmath28 and @xmath101 are zero because we have two field zeros .",
    "we introduce the separation vector @xmath92 and substitute @xmath102 . equating terms of equal powers in @xmath99",
    "we then obtain @xmath103 and thus @xmath104 .",
    "thus , in the second order field expansion , the midway point between the two zeroes @xmath105 and @xmath106 lies on the manifold .",
