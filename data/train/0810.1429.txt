    "the existence of ultra high - speed stars in the halo of the milky way was recognized by hills ( 1998 ) as an inevitable consequence of the presence of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in a region of high stellar density such as the galactic center .",
    "hills estimated that the disruption of tightly bound binaries in the vicinity of the black hole may propel stars to speeds exceeding @xmath6 km / s , well beyond the escape velocity from the milky way .",
    "the discovery of a population of `` hypervelocity '' stars ( hvs , for short , brown et al . 2005 ) in radial velocity surveys of faint b - type stars in the galactic halo ( brown et al .",
    "2006 , 2007a , b ) gave strong support to hills proposal and led to substantial theoretical interest in the topic .",
    "the latest compilation by brown , geller & kenyon ( 2008 ) lists 16 hvs , all receding at speeds exceeding @xmath7 km / s and reaching up to @xmath8 km / s in the galactic rest frame .",
    "hvs are widely thought to owe their extreme velocities to hills mechanism , since many of the stars appear to be short - lived , massive main sequence stars such as those often found near the galactic center .",
    "other mechanisms also capable of accelerating stars to high speeds , such as binary disruption in stellar clusters , have usually been disfavored on the grounds that the maximum ejection velocity is unlikely to exceed the escape velocity at the surface of a star , and thus would only be able to accelerate stars up to no more than a few hundred km / s .",
    "the mediation of the much deeper potential well of a supermassive black hole thus appears needed to explain the extreme velocities observed for the hvs population .",
    "although some hvs have very likely been ejected by the galactic smbh , there are a number of issues that remain unresolved in this scenario .",
    "for example , the velocity distribution of hvs and , in particular , the lack of _ very _ high - velocity stars ( i.e. , with speeds exceeding @xmath6 km / s ) , is not easily understood ( see , e.g. , sesana , haardt & madau 2007 ) . nor is the existence of at least one hvs moving at a speed greater than @xmath9 km / s in the galactic rest frame ( hd 271791 ; heber et al 2008 ) whose proper motion apparently rules out a galactic center origin .",
    "although small number statistics may explain away these concerns , we examine in this letter further peculiarities in the spatial distribution and kinematics of hvs and argue that these suggest , at least for some hvs , an origin different from the smbh - ejection mechanism .",
    "we begin by examining the distribution of travel times and the angular clustering of hvs compiled from the literature , and use numerical simulations to explore an alternative mechanism able to populate the galactic halo with high - speed stars .",
    "we end by considering several observational tests that may , in the future , be used to discriminate between these competing scenarios .",
    "we use primarily data from the brown et al ( 2006 , 2007a , b , hereafter bgkk , for short ) mmt and whipple surveys of b - type halo stars selected from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "our analysis uses galactic rest - frame radial velocities , positions in the sky , and distances , as given by the authors .",
    "we note that distance estimates are only listed for stars with velocities exceeding @xmath10 km / s .",
    "these estimates typically assume that the stars are in the main sequence , although it is difficult to rule out that some ( or many ) are evolved stars in the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) .",
    "this is one of the main systematic uncertainties in our analysis , but it is a shortcoming shared with all other attempts to study the kinematics of hvs stars with current datasets .      the left panel in figure  [ figs : vr_r ] shows the galactic rest frame radial velocity distribution of all stars in the bgkk survey , whereas the right panel shows the radial velocity of all stars with published distance estimates .",
    "these are all high - speed stars ( @xmath11 km / s ) out in the tail of the radial velocity distribution ( filled symbols ) .",
    "open symbols correspond to the @xmath12 new stars recently reported by brown , geller & kenyon ( 2008 , hereafter bgk08 ) and are added here only for completeness , since data for the underlying survey from which these stars have been identified are not yet publicly available .",
    "( `` dotted '' symbols identify stars in the circle shown in fig .",
    "[ figs : brown3 ] , as discussed below . ) for illustration , we have added in figure  [ figs : vr_r ] the position in the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane of several milky way satellite companions , as labeled .",
    "for each star with published distance estimate and radial velocity we compute a travel time from the galactic center , assuming purely radial orbits in the simple galactic potential model of bromley et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "this is given by a spherically symmetric density profile , @xmath15 , where @xmath16pc@xmath17 and @xmath18 pc ( kenyon et al 2008 ) .",
    "the thick solid curves in fig .",
    "[ figs : vr_r ] represent the loci of stars with constant travel time ( labeled in myr ) , whereas the dotted lines show the escape velocity from the milky way , assuming it is embedded within a cold dark matter halo with virial velocity ) and define the virial velocity as the circular velocity within a radius , @xmath19 , enclosing a mean overdensity of @xmath1 times the critical value for closure .",
    "the virial velocity defines implicitly the halo mass : for @xmath20 km / s , the mass within @xmath21 kpc / h , is @xmath22/h .",
    "we assume h@xmath23 throughout the paper . ]",
    "@xmath20 km / s and @xmath24 km / s , respectively . the hvs data in figure  [ figs : vr_r ] is colored according to travel time , binned in equally spaced logarithmic intervals ( see also the histogram in the inset of fig .  [ figs : brown3 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figs : vr_r ] illustrates a few interesting points .",
    "one is that very few stars are actually unbound if the virial velocity of the milky way is of the order of @xmath25 km / s , the circular speed at the solar circle .",
    "this is actually what is required by recent models of galaxy formation in order to match simultaneously the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation and the normalization of the galaxy luminosity function ( see , e.g. , croton et al 2006 for a full discussion ) . in other words , for @xmath20 km / s , the hvs speeds are unusually high , but not necessarily extreme , and only one hvs would be clearly unbound .",
    "this is important , since it suggests that more prosaic dynamical effects that do not rely on smbh ejection may be responsible for the unusual speeds of the hvs population .",
    "the second point to note is that the distribution of hvs travel times is not uniform .",
    "this is illustrated in the histogram shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figs : brown3 ] : 19 of the 30 hvs in the northern hemisphere seem to share a common travel time ( see bin centered at @xmath26 km / s ) .",
    "the peak in the histogram is higher than expected from a model where ejections occur uniformly in time .",
    "the model prediction is shown by the solid curve in the inset histogram , after taking into account the volume surveyed , the finite lifetime of late b - main sequence stars , and assuming the distribution of smbh - ejection velocities computed by bromley et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "the significance of the peak seems high : selecting at random 30 stars from such model yields a peak with 19 ( or more ) stars in fewer than 1 in 1000 trials .",
    "the small number of objects involved precludes a more conclusive assessment of this possibility , but we note that this is not necessarily inconsistent with smbh ejection . in this scenario , a `` preferred travel time '' may just reflect a burst of star formation that boosted the population of binaries in the galactic center region a few hundred myr ago .",
    "we discuss a different interpretation below .",
    "[ figs : brown3 ] shows an aitoff projection in galactic coordinates of all stars in the bgkk survey .",
    "high - speed stars ( including those reported recently by bgk08 ) are shown in color , coded according to their travel times , as shown in the bottom - left inset .",
    "the main point to note in this figure is that the hvs population is not uniformly distributed in the sky , and that its angular distribution appears inconsistent with a random sample of stars in the survey .",
    "one way of quantifying this is to focus on the region around the constellation of leo , which seems to contain the majority of hvs .",
    "we choose for this a 26@xmath27-radius circle centered at the position of leo i , itself a high - speed ( possibly unbound ) distant satellite companion of the milky way ( e.g. sales et al .",
    "2007a , and mateo , olszewski & walker 2008 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath28 stars in the bgkk survey fall within the circle , or @xmath29 of the total of @xmath30 halo stars in the northern section of the bgkk survey .",
    "by contrast , @xmath31 of all stars with @xmath32 km / s fall within the vicinity of leo i , a proportion that rises to @xmath33 for stars with @xmath34 km / s .    we may estimate the significance of this result by repeating the same calculation after randomly reassigning the measured radial velocities amongst the stars in the survey .",
    "a proportion at least as high as @xmath31 of @xmath32 km / s stars falls within the circle in fewer than @xmath35 in @xmath36 such random trials in @xmath37 for @xmath32 km / s stars , and decreases even further if the center of the circle is moved from leo i in the direction of leo iv .",
    "these estimates assume that the stars in the bgk08 and bgkk parent surveys have similar distributions in the sky . ] .",
    "for @xmath34 km / s stars , the corresponding number is fewer than @xmath35 in @xmath38 trials .",
    "also , since the majority of hvs are at galactic longitude @xmath39 ( see fig .  [ figs : brown3 ] ) it is unlikely that the hvs anisotropy is the result of the slightly larger effective volume surveyed in the direction of the anti - galactic center .",
    "this supports the idea that the enhanced clustering of hvs in the direction of leo is real .",
    "the observed angular clustering is not easily explained in the smbh - ejection scenario , which predicts an hvs population distributed approximately isotropically across the sky .",
    "the anisotropic distribution and the preferred travel time discussed in the preceding subsections suggest that at least part of the hvs population may have a different origin from the smbh - ejection mechanism .",
    "we explore here an alternative scenario where these two peculiarities are reproduced naturally .",
    "our proposal envisions high - velocity stars in the halo as a result of the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy in the galactic potential .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figs : vallstr ] , where we show the position of `` star '' particles in a cosmological simulation of the formation of a galaxy in the @xmath40cdm cosmogony .",
    "the simulation is one in the series presented by steinmetz and navarro ( 2002 ) and analyzed in detail in abadi , navarro & steinmetz ( 2006 ) , where we refer the interested reader to for further technical details .",
    "[ figs : vallstr ] shows the position of all stars in the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane , after rescaling the system to a virial velocity of @xmath20 km / s .",
    "this scaling allows us to compare the results directly with observations of the milky way . as in fig .",
    "[ figs : vr_r ] , the dotted lines indicate the escape velocity of the system , and the solid curves indicate loci of constant travel time .    the data in fig .",
    "[ figs : vallstr ] are shown at a snapshot chosen a couple of hundred myr after the final merger / disruption of a dwarf satellite in the potential of the main galaxy .",
    "the stars of the disrupted satellite are shown in red in order to distinguish them from the rest of the stars in the simulated galaxy , shown in black .",
    "note that a long stream of stars formerly belonging to the satellite follow closely a line of constant travel time .",
    "these are stars that were stripped from the dwarf during its last pericentric passage , just before its main body merged with the central galaxy . the travel - time coherence in the stream ( or `` tidal tail '' ) results from the fact that all those stars were stripped from the dwarf at the same time .",
    "stars along the stream have different energies , but it is clear that the disruption event has been able to push some stars into very high - velocity orbits , some even exceeding the local escape speed from the system .",
    "> from the perspective of an observer near the center of the galaxy ( such as an observer at the sun in the milky way ) the stream would be seen projected onto a well - defined direction in the sky .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figs : aitoff ] , which shows a projection on the sky of all stars in the halo of the simulated galaxy ( i.e. , excluding stars with distances less than @xmath41 kpc from the center ) . the points in color correspond to the tidal debris from the disrupting dwarf . in particular ,",
    "blue dots highlight those with radial velocity exceeding @xmath42 km / s .",
    "note that , from the sun s perspective , the `` tidal tail '' of high velocity stars stripped from the dwarf falls within a well - defined region spanning a few tens of degrees in the sky .",
    "[ figs : vallstr ] and  [ figs : aitoff ] thus illustrate that tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy is able to push stars to speeds high enough to escape the galaxy , and provides a mechanism to populate the halo with high - velocity stars with kinematic and angular clustering peculiarities resembling those of the hvs population discussed above .",
    "this suggests that at least some stars of the hvs population may have originated in the recent disruption of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "how can this rather unorthodox proposal be validated / ruled out ?",
    "fortunately , the most natural predictions of this scenario differ significantly from those motivated by the smbh - ejection mechanism .",
    "in particular , a broader search for high - speed stars should confirm the enhancement of hvs in the constellation of leo .",
    "high - speed stars should also exist amongst all spectral types , and should contain a significant number of evolved stars and stars of low metallicity , which should make up the bulk of the stellar content of the dwarf . with enough statistics , a radial - velocity angular gradient amongst high - speed stars might also be observed , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ figs : aitoff ] .",
    "the tail should also contain returning stars with negative velocity that are relatively nearby ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ figs : vallstr ] ) so it would be worth checking existing surveys of nearby stars for unusual velocity patterns in the same general direction in the sky .",
    "we note that our argumentation rests on the assumption that the halo of the milky way is relatively massive ( i.e. , @xmath43 km / s ) .",
    "this is suggested by semianalytic galaxy formation models and is consistent with timing argument mass estimates for the milky way ( li & white 2007 ) .",
    "there is evidence , however , that the virial velocity of the galactic halo might be considerably smaller ( @xmath44 km / s ) , as indicated , for example , by recent analysis of milky way satellite data ( sales et al 2007b ) , of rave data for solar neighborhood stars ( smith et al 2007 ) , and of segue data on halo stars ( xue et al 2008 ) .",
    "this issue remains unresolved , but should a low mass for the milky way halo be confirmed , it would mean that a large fraction of hvs would be truly unbound and would argue against the tidal debris interpretation proposed here .",
    "although examining further a tidal debris origin for hvs appears worthwhile , it should be recognized that this proposal is not without shortcomings .",
    "one of the main difficulties is to explain why a tidal stream emanating from a dwarf should contain short - lived , massive main - sequence stars , unless the accreting dwarf was gas - rich and underwent a burst of star formation , perhaps triggered by pericentric passages prior to its final disruption .",
    "gas - rich dwarfs tend to be rather massive , and careful modeling is needed in order to examine whether the timescales really work out and to explain why the remains of the putative dwarf have escaped detection so far .",
    "systematic radial - velocity surveys of large numbers of faint stars across vast regions of the sky , such as those being planned by the gaia satellite , will undoubtedly be able to settle these questions in the foreseeable future .",
