    "the theory of accretion disks , motivated in a large degree by their occurrence in some binary systems , particularly cataclysmic variables , has been most fully developed for the thin keplerian disks @xcite . based on their geometric shapes ,",
    "accretion disks are generally divided into two distinct classes , thin disks and thick disks .",
    "the theory of thin accretion disks ( shakura & sanyev 1973 ) is well understood whereas there is no universally accepted model for thick accretion disks .",
    "the current interest in this theory is due to the possibility that thick disks may be relevant to the understanding of central power sources in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "observational evidence suggests that in the center of many galaxies , matter is somehow ejected to large distances and gives off high energy radiation as it interacts with the external medium .",
    "there are other theoretical reasons for pursuing the study of thick disks . in the theory of thin disks ,",
    "radial pressure gradients are neglected and vertical pressure balance is solved separately.it was shown that this approximation is valid as long as the disk is geometrically thin . this condition may be violated in the innermost region of accretion disks around stellar black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the study of thick disks provides a better theoretical understanding of thin disks as a limiting case and enables us to deal with intermediate situations @xcite    when considering the formation process of astrophysical objects , such as galaxies and stars , the most crucial factor is self - gravity . in the standard thin accretion disk model ,",
    "the effect of self - gravity is neglected , and only pressure supports the vertical structure .",
    "by contrast , the theory of self - gravitating accretion disks , is less developed .",
    "early numerical work of self gravitating accretion disks began with n - body modelling ( cassen & moosman 1991 ; tomley , cassen & steinman - cameron 1991 ) . the time evolution of non - self - gravitating viscose disk has long been studied , and now we have a good theory describing its steady structure and its basic time - dependent behavior @xcite ; @xcite . but with the added assumption of self - gravity in the disk ,",
    "it is not easy to follow its dynamical evolution , mainly because the basic equations for the disks are highly nonlinear @xcite ; @xcite . to solve the nonlinear equations of self - gravitating disks ,",
    "the technique of self - similar analysis is sometimes useful .",
    "several classes of self - similar solutions were known previously , but all of them considered a disk in a fixed , external potential .",
    "self - similar behavior provides an important class of solutions to the self - gravitating fluid equations . on the one hand , many physical problems often attained self - similar limits for a wide range of initial conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - similar properties allows us to investigate properties of solutions in arbitrary details , without any of the associated difficulties of numerical hydrodynamics .    pen ( 1994 )",
    "presented a general classification of self - similar self - gravitating fluids .",
    "fukue & sakamoto ( 1992 ) also analyzed the vertical structure of self - gravitating disks , but it is impossible to compare their models with realistic disks , because they computed the vertical structure using the thin - disk approximations for polytropes .",
    "finally , using the numerically method proposed by hachisu ( 1986 ) and hachisu et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , woodward et al .",
    "( 1992 ) developed a code to investigate the interaction between a disk and its central object .",
    "however , they only considered polytropic disks .",
    "hashimoto , eriguchi & muller ( 1995 ) presented a two - dimensional equilibrium model for self - gravitating keplerian disks .",
    "they showed that the shape of the disk ( or disk thickness ) in flounced by the rotational law and the ratio of the disk mass to the mass of the central star .",
    "bodo & curir ( 1992)computed the equilibrium structure of a self - gravitating thick accretion disk by an iterative procedure which produced a final density distribution in equilibrium with the potential coming from it .",
    "they showed that the geometrical size and shape the disks influenced by self - gravity of the disk .",
    "accretion disks , containing magnetic fields , have been the subject of intense study in recent years .",
    "the role of the magnetic field in the equilibrium of accretion disks has been investigated by some authors @xcite ; @xcite for the thin disk models , an ideal magneto hydrodynamics ( mhd ) equilibrium with azimuthal velocity and poloidal magnetic field has been analyzed @xcite ; @xcite . using numerical methods",
    ", these authors found that the magnetic field may change the shape and angular momentum distribution in the disk .",
    "thick disk configurations with a poloidal magnetic field has been studied by @xcite , in the mhd framework @xcite .",
    "they investigated the equilibrium structure of thick disks and their stability in the presence of a dipolar magnetic field due to a non - rotating central object .",
    "their solution shows that the pressure and the density equilibrium profiles are strongly modified by a toroidal magnetic field , resulting from the interaction between the permanent dipolar magnetic field and the inertia of the gas disk . in a magnetized disk , the inertia of the gas",
    "is expected to bend the magnetic field lines backwards , creating a toroidal component , which in turn may collimate a hydrodynamic outflow over long distances , forming jets .",
    "they assumed that the disk is non - accreting , stationary , axisymmetric , non - viscous , magnetized and that it is in equilibrium around a compact object , with only an azimuthal motion @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the role of self - gravity in thick disk equilibrium in the presence of the dipolar magnetic field of a central star .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : the general formalism of the problem is discussed in section 2 , a self - similar solution of the equilibrium of non - self - gravitating accretion disks in the presence of a dipolar magnetic field is constructed in section 3 , a self - similar solution of self - gravitating magnetized accretion disks is constructed in section 4 and a summary of the main ideas is given in section5 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we are interested in analyzing the role of self - gravity in a thick disk equilibrium in the presence of the dipolar magnetic field of a central star . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the influence of energy dissipation .",
    "we consider the disk as a non - accreting mhd flow around a magnetized , non rotating , central compact object .",
    "the disk is assumed to be stationary and axi - symmetric .",
    "we use a spherical polar , inertial , coordinate system , @xmath5 , with origin fixed on the central object .",
    "the basic equations are two components of the euler equation in @xmath6 direction and poison s equation : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the gas density , pressure , toroidal velocity component , toroidal magnetic field , and gravitational potential respectively .",
    "also g and m are the gravitational constant and the mass of central star .",
    "solution of equations ( 1 - 3 ) , in general , is a difficult task .",
    "therefore , to simplify the problem , we impose two constraints . we adopt for @xmath14 and @xmath15 the same form as that given in ( banerjee , bhatt & das ; 1995 ) .",
    "they assume that the magnetic field of the central star is dipolar : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the magnetic field strength on the surface of the central star near the pole and @xmath19 is its radius .",
    "they showed that the dipolar field with the azimuthal motion of the gas disk , could make a toroidal component of the magnetic field , that is : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a magnetic field strength , and @xmath22 is a real constant .",
    "the general solution for @xmath15 is : @xmath23 where @xmath19 denotes the radius of the star .",
    "@xmath24 is a constant with the dimension of a velocity and n is a real constant .",
    "now , we try to solve our equations with these constraints . at first",
    "we introduce @xmath25 according to : @xmath26 where @xmath19 and @xmath27 are the star and the disk radiuses respectively .",
    "now we rewrite the eqs.(6)-(7 ) as : @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath21,@xmath24 are the strength of the toroidal component of the magnetic field and the rotational velocity on the surface of the star respectively .",
    "we can see clearly that the structure of the magnetic field of the central star can be modified by a rotational velocity of the gas disk .      in this subsection",
    "we want to study the magnetic field of central stars in the presence of a rotating gas disk . in a magnetized disk , magnetic field lines",
    "are deformed by the rotating gas . in this case , the gas is expected to be tied to the magnetic field lines and its inertia causes them to be bent backward and create a toroidal component .    to study the magnetic field configuration within the disk we will look at the magnetic field lines , which satisfy the following equation : @xmath30    in order to visualize the field line configurations , we now choose @xmath31 in eq.6 .",
    "it is useful to express the results in a cartesian frame through the usual relations ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if we apply these transformations to the force equation we can obtain the corresponding parametric equations that generate the magnetic field configurations : @xmath33\\sin^3\\theta,\\ ] ] @xmath34\\sin^3\\theta,\\ ] ] @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant of integration ( because we consider axi - symmetry solutions , we can set it to zero without any loss of generality ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the disk inner radius . from the above equations we can see that the azimuthal component of the magnetic field can affect magnetic field line configurations in the disk . in fig(1 )",
    "we plot several 2-d field line configurations .",
    "we can see that when the toroidal component of the magnetic field is larger , the deformation of the magnetic field line is more obvious . in fig.2",
    "we plot several 3-d magnetic field configurations with the same parameters .",
    "= 3.5 in = 3.3 in    = 3.5 in = 3.3 in    and now we come back to eqs.(1 - 3 ) and introduce other dimensionless variables for the gravitational potential , the density and the pressure of the disk s material : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are defined as : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45    by inserting these dimensionless parameters into eqs.(1 - 2 ) , and by performing some simplifications , we obtain : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 are constants defined by : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    by introducing three dimensionless parameters indicating the relative importance of the energy of the toroidal component of the magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , the centrifugal energy ( @xmath1 ) , the thermal energy ( @xmath2 ) with respect to the gravitational potential energy of the central object , we can study them separately . if this simplification is used for poisson s equation , eq.3 , we find that : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of the disk out to @xmath27 : @xmath56 we may introduce another dimensionless variable @xmath3 that gives the importance of self - gravity .",
    "@xmath3 is the ratio of the disk mass to the central object mass : @xmath57    we would like to investigate self - similar solutions that describe the equilibrium structure of the thick disk .",
    "thus we introduce self - similar solutions for the density and pressure of the gas disk : @xmath58 @xmath59    since we do not consider energy transport mechanisms , no specific form for the equation of state is assumed . as a result of our model",
    "we find that the density and pressure clearly show no polytropic , isothermal or other simple relation .",
    "we show that the indices in the non - self - gravitating and self - gravitating cases are completely different and that the mass distribution of the disk changes due to this fact . solving eqs.(19 - 20 ) and",
    "eqs.(27 - 28 ) gives @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in this section we try to derive a self - similar solution of non - self - gravitating disks . in this regime",
    "we put @xmath62 equal to zero .",
    "if we put eqs.(27 - 28 ) into eqs.(19 - 20 ) we obtain : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66    in order to obtain the indices of the self - similar solution , we require that in each equation the exponent of @xmath25 be the same for all the terms . here",
    "we get : @xmath67 and we have : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    these equations state that for getting a physical solution , @xmath71 must be less than unity . then by putting the self - similar indices in the equations and by doing some simplifications ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath72 @xmath73    we have two equations with two unknowns .",
    "the first equation can be used to express @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75 : @xmath76\\ ] ]    = 3.5 in = 3.3 in    with our definitions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "the maximum density is at @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",

    "this value depends on our dimensionless parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath0 represents the effect of the toroidal component of the magnetic field and @xmath1 the effect of the rotation velocity .",
    "fig(3 ) shows typical examples of the self - similar solution in equations ( 37 ) and ( 49 ) . in fig(3 ) , the density profiles , the iso - density contours and the variations of pressure along the meridional axes are represented .",
    "the density profiles for different values of @xmath1 ( rotational velocity ) and @xmath71 are displayed . as can be seen",
    ", the parameter @xmath1 determines the overall shape of the matter distribution . by increasing the effect of the rotational velocity ( @xmath1 ) , the shape of the disk changes to a thinner one , which is due to centrifugal force . in fig(3 ) , we also present the iso - density contours for the same value of @xmath1 .",
    "as can be seen , the shape of the disk is strongly modified for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we can see that in this case , the density does not vanish at @xmath95 ( in the rotational axes ) .",
    "our solution agrees with @xcite solutions for such systems .    we should mention that the solution we have found is a mathematical one . as a result",
    ", the solution has a physical meaning only for parts of the parameter space . in this self - similar solution",
    "we have a singularity in @xmath96 that arises from @xmath97 in the integral of equation ( 46 ) ; thus we can not study the effect of the magnetic field in the equilibrium structure of the gas disk .",
    "that is the nature of the solution .",
    "after we have found the analytical solution for non - self - gravitating disks , we will try to investigate the effect of self - gravity in such disks .",
    "in order to gain a better understanding of the physical situation of the disk , we include self - gravity in the above equations .",
    "the self - similar technique is utilized once again .",
    "if we introduce eq.(27 - 28 ) in to eq .",
    "( 19 - 20 ) we obtain : @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101    for finding the self - similar solution we must set equal the terms that have the same power .",
    "we obtain : @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104    now we can identify the radial dependence of the density and pressure of the gas disk ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) as functions of @xmath71 .",
    "we can insert eqs.(50 - 51 ) into eq.(24 ) with use eq.(27 ) we can find : @xmath105 @xmath106 where we used a @xmath71 as a free parameter and : @xmath107 @xmath108,\\ ] ] @xmath109 @xmath110,\\ ] ]    now if we introduce eqs.(55 - 56 ) into eq .",
    "( 24 ) and do some simplifications , we obtain an ordinary differential equation with two unknown functions ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) : @xmath113=\\frac{3m_d}{m}d(\\theta)\\ ] ]    in order to solve this equation , we need another relation between @xmath111 and @xmath112 . by looking at the definitions of @xmath114",
    ", we can find : @xmath115    = 2.8 in = 3.3 in    = 2.8 in = 3.3 in    now by solving eqs .",
    "( 59 - 60 ) we can find the angular dependence of the density and pressure of the gas disk ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "we linearize these equations , introduce another dimensionless constant defined as the ratio of the disk mass to the mass of the central object ( @xmath3 ) , and we use @xmath117 instead of @xmath75 in order to simplify the equations .",

    "fig(4 ) shows the variations of the density for different values of @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 in meridional direction .",
    "concerning the geometrical shape of the disk we can see the tendency of the disk to become thinner when self - gravity plays an important role ( @xmath3 is large ) .",
    "and then we can see that a strong magnetic field coming from the central star can produce a large toroidal component , which can change the thickness of the disk near the pole .",
    "fig(4 ) shows the iso - density contours of the disk for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 . in fig(6 )",
    "we present the iso - density profile of the disk for different values of @xmath1 and the iso - pressure profile of the disk for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we can see in the iso - pressure profile that near the pole there is a singularity ; maybe this big pressure gradient could produce a jet from the pole ! in order to test this effect",
    "we should investigate the time evolution of such systems .",
    "this could be the subject of future works .    concerning the ratio of the mass of the disk to the mass of the central star , eriguchi & muller ( 1993 ) extended their code to include a central object for a thick disk and calculated the equilibrium structure of the disk which rotates according to the @xmath131-const law , where @xmath131 is the specific angular momentum .",
    "comparing this with the toroidal star of hashimito et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , where the central object is not included , the relative thickness of the disk is smaller , which is caused by effects due to gravity of the central star ( see figures in eriguchi & muller 1993 ) . as for the rotation law , hashimito et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and eriguchi & muller ( 1993 ) obtained rather thick disks , while hashimito et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found a flat disk shape where the gravitational force of the central object becomes relatively week compared with the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "our results agree with the latter one .",
    "we can see in fig(4 - 6 ) that the shape of the disk ( or disk thickness ) is influenced by the rotational law and the ratio of the disk mass to the mass of the central star .",
    "= 3.3 in = 3.3 in",
    "in this paper , we find a global equilibrium of a self - gravitating disk around a magnetized compact object .",
    "we ignore the effects of energy dissipation and radial flow .",
    "we have investigated a stationary model for a self - gravitating disk influenced by a strong magnetic field coming from the central object .",
    "we ignore the effects of the local magnetic field of the disk .",
    "we consider that the radial flow is negligible with respect to the azimuthal motion of the gas in the disk .",
    "we find two types of self - similar solutions for such disks .",
    "the first one is the non - self - gravitating self - similar solution that shows that the shape of the disk changes when the physical parameters are modified .",
    "the second one is the self - gravitating self - similar solution . in this class of solutions we can study the effect of self - gravity on the shape and thickness of the disk .    in the non - self - gravitating solution",
    "we find an analytical solution for some parts of the parameter space .",
    "this solution is found with a self - similarity method , and it gives a picture of the equilibrium structure of the gas material around a magnetized compact object .",
    "the solution shows that the rotational velocity of the gas disk can change the equilibrium picture .",
    "the important result that can be inferred from this solution is the non - vanishing value of the density on the rotation axis .",
    "this value depends on the dimensionless parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath0 represents the effect of the magnetic field and @xmath1 the effect of the rotational velocity .    in the self - gravitating solution",
    ", we find the vertical ( meridional ) dependence of the gas density in the disk fig(4 ) .",
    "the external dipole field can change the thickness of the disk near the pole , and the existence of a sharp density gradient in the @xmath125-direction indicates a rapid decrease of the matter density away from the equatorial plane .",
    "but when self - gravity plays an important role in the disk equilibrium ( by increasing @xmath3 ) we can see that the thickness of the disk decreases .    in fig(5 - 6 )",
    "we show some iso - density and iso - pressure contours of the equilibrium configuration of the disk for different values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath71 . in the iso - pressure profile",
    "we can see a large pressure gradient near the poles , which may lead to outflows in those regions !",
    "this idea would require further study , such as a dynamical investigation .",
    "we see that the presence of self - gravity in a thick disk , can change the geometrical shape of the disk and plays an important role in equilibrium structure of the disk .",
    "we also see that the strength of the magnetic field can change the structure of the disk near the poles .",
    "finally , we must admit that our model does not deserve the name ",
    "accretion  disk , since we did not include the accretion ( mass ) flow .",
    "this study , one of the first of its kind , is a search for an equilibrium structure of a thick disk in the presence of an external stellar dipole along with a self - consistently generated toroidal magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "the meridional structure of the disk is mainly due to the balance of plasma pressure gradient , magnetic force due to @xmath12 , and centrifugal force .",
    "the existence of an equilibrium structure , in fact , encourages one to look for generalizations of the analysis to the case when the radial velocity @xmath132 , representing accretions . on the other hand , yet another important aspect to be considered is the generalization of the newtonian analysis to general relativistic formalism wherein space - time curvature produced by the strong gravitational field of the central object would modify the magnetic fields and introduce new features .",
    "our disk model might also apply to systems where the central object is a black hole , a neutron star or an active galactic nucleus .",
    "however , in this paper we modelled the disk under the assumption of a newtonian potential . for a system where the central object is a black hole",
    ", the pseudo - newtonian potential will play an essential role near the central object .",
    "the modification arising from a pseudo - newtonian potential to the disk will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "consequently , we can not calculate the accretion luminosity .",
    "thus , to compare our results with other models or observations , it will be necessary to include mass flow in our model .",
