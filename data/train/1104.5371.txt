    "experimental data at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and now also at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have shown compelling evidence of strongly interacting qcd - medium production in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the measured transverse energies , transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) spectra and , in particular , the significant azimuthal anisotropy ( elliptic flow ) of final - state hadrons suggest together that partonic qcd matter , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is formed in these collisions .    in the collision of two nuclei ,",
    "the azimuthally anisotropic overlap region sets preferred directions for the transverse flow . in hydrodynamical models ,",
    "pressure gradients turn the spatial anisotropy of the produced hot matter into a flow anisotropy , which is transmitted into the momentum distributions of measurable final - state hadrons at the decoupling of the system . however , the hadronic measurement reflects the flow ( and temperature ) conditions only in the freeze - out region where the hadronic interactions cease .    in comparison with partons",
    ", photons interact only very weakly with the qcd matter and thus a photon emitted from the medium most likely escapes from the system without interacting .",
    "this is seen also in the measurements where photons do not show a similar suppression as hadrons when we move from proton+proton ( p+p ) to nucleus+nucleus ( @xmath4 ) collisions @xcite .",
    "since photons can escape from the medium without interacting , they carry information about the system at the time of their production .    ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions are particularly interesting in regard with direct photon production , since relative to p+p collisions there are different types of nuclear effects at work as well as a number of important further sources for photons . in p+p ( and also in p+@xmath5 ) collisions the direct photons are prompt photons originating from the primary hard interactions of partons , and fragmentation photons emitted by the primarily produced high-@xmath3 partons @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions",
    "( and also in p+@xmath5 ) , both the prompt and fragmentation photons at high-@xmath3 are subjected to nuclear effects in the parton distribution functions of the colliding nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite for the quantification of these effects and their uncertainties ) .",
    "the fragmentation photon component is , however , expected to be suppressed due to the quenching of partonic jets in qcd matter in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "in addition to this , in @xmath4 collisions the jet(parton)-matter interactions , i.e. the jet - photon conversion @xcite and collision - induced photon emission from high - energy partons can produce photons which are important in the mid-@xmath3 region @xcite .",
    "finally , the hot medium itself emits thermal photons , which are expected to be important in the few - gev region and below , as discussed in the hydrodynamical studies of refs .",
    "@xcite .    in heavy - ion collisions , it is very difficult to distinguish between the different direct photon sources .",
    "in addition , there is a huge decay - photon background to deal with .",
    "the elliptic flow of direct photons could , however , shed more light on the interplay of the various photon production sources which differ from each other as follows : at high-@xmath3 ( above @xmath6  gev at rhic ) , where prompt photons dominate @xcite , and where the fragmentation photons are more suppressed in the out - of - plane direction ( perpendicular to the impact parameter ) , the photonic @xmath2 should be positive but very small @xcite .",
    "the jet - medium interactions in turn increase the photon production most strongly in the in - plane direction ( parallel to the impact parameter ) , thus causing a negative @xmath2 contribution at mid-@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the thermal photon production is affected by the hydrodynamical transverse flow itself , so that photons in the in - plane direction get a stronger boost . as shown earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite , this results in a positive elliptic flow for the thermal photons .",
    "since the net contribution from other sources to photon @xmath2 is expected to be very small or even negative @xcite , a large ( hadron - like ) photon @xmath2 measured in the few-@xmath3 region and below , should thus serve as a signature of thermal photon dominance . since qcd matter is emitting photons throughout its entire evolution",
    ", measuring thermal photon @xmath3 spectra and @xmath2 would thus give important further constraints for the dynamics and properties of qcd matter .",
    "in this work we focus on computing the thermal photon @xmath3 spectra and elliptic flow in @xmath0 au+au collisions at rhic and in @xmath1  tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc , using an ideal - hydrodynamical framework which is constrained by the measured hadron spectra at rhic and lhc .",

    "[ fig : charged mult ] we show , from ref .",
    "@xcite , the measured charged - particle multiplicity ( divided by the number of participant pairs ) as a function of the number of participants calculated from the optical glauber model . choosing the initial transverse density according to the binary - collision - scaled energy or entropy density ( ebc , sbc ) , or wounded - nucleon - scaled energy or entropy density ( ewn , swn ) as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we compute the charged - particle multiplicity in the centrality classes obtained above . the initial entropy at @xmath22 in these four cases is kept fixed .",
    "we see that the swn profile fits the measured centrality dependence quite well .",
    "we will therefore choose the swn profile at rhic and , for simplicity , use the same profile also for the lhc pb+pb collisions .",

    "the data are from the star collaboration @xcite.,height=340 ]      to describe the spacetime evolution of the produced qcd matter , we solve the ideal - hydrodynamic equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath25 is the fluid four - velocity , @xmath26 is the energy density and @xmath27 is the pressure . as we are interested in particle and photon production at midrapidity , we may assume that net - baryon density is negligible .",
    "since the particle spectra are approximately flat at midrapidity , we can simplify our hydrodynamical equations by assuming longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "we use the shasta algorithm @xcite to solve this ( 2 + 1)-dimensional numerical problem .    to close the hydrodynamic equations we need an equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we study the sensitivity of thermal photon production to the eos , by focusing on two different cases .",
    "the first case , called here `` eosq '' , corresponds to the bag model eos with a first order phase transition @xcite . in eosq ,",
    "the high - temperature phase with the bag constant is an ideal gas of three flavors of massless quarks and gluons , while the low - temperature phase is an ideal gas of all hadronic states with @xmath29 gev .",
    "these two phases are connected with a mixed phase , and the bag constant is chosen so that the critical temperature is @xmath30 .",
    "the second eos case , which we call `` eosl '' , is adopted from ref .",
    "this eos is quite similar to the recently constructed lattice eos `` s95-p '' @xcite , and as discussed in @xcite , the hadron spectra and elliptic flow are in practice insensitive to the differences between eosl and s95-p . since the lattice data suggests that the phase transition from the qgp to hadron gas ( hg ) is not of first order , one may consider the eosq case somewhat unrealistic .",
    "however , the computation of thermal photon production in the phase - transition region requires well - defined qgp and hadron - gas fractions , which are available only in the eosq case . with eosl , in the absence of such phase fractions , there are additional uncertainties in the thermal photon calculation related to the qgp and hg emission rates .    thermal transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) spectra of hadrons",
    "are obtained using the cooper - frye method @xcite where particle emission from a freeze - out hypersurface @xmath31 is calculated with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the momentum distribution function of a specific hadron type .",
    "we assume the system to decouple at a single constant temperature @xmath34 , which is fixed so that we get a good agreement with the measured @xmath3 spectra of pions at rhic .",
    "with eosq , we have @xmath35  mev , and 160 mev with eosl .    after the thermal emission of particles from the freeze - out surface is calculated , we take into account the strong and electromagnetic 2- and 3-body decays .",
    "this treatment is essential since most of the stable particles in our case come from the decays of heavy resonances .",

    "these rates were used in the previously published lhc predictions @xcite . _",
    "( ii ) _ the more recent ones from ref .  @xcite which account also for the finite size of hadrons through form factors .",
    "we call these rates `` trg '' .    with eosl , which smoothly goes from the qgp to the hg phase without specifying their volume fractions , one needs to choose how to switch from the qgp to hg photon emission rates . for simplicity , we choose to do this at a constant temperature @xmath48 but we vary @xmath48 between 170 and 200 mev .",
    "we label these two cases as `` eosl170 '' and `` eosl200 '' .    to illustrate the differences between the r92 and trg emission rates which will be important for the photonic @xmath2 results presented in sec .",
    "iii ahead , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate comparison ] the ratio of the photon emission rates in the hg and qgp at two different fixed temperatures .",
    "we see that ( since both hg rates have been divided by the same qgp rate ) the difference between r92 and trg is about a factor six at large energies .",
    "furthermore , the trg rates are always well below the qgp rates , while this is not the case for the r92 rates .",
    "elliptic flow for the thermal photons is calculated as in eq .  .",
    "since the thermal photons can not be distinguished from other direct photons , the elliptic flow from thermal photons alone can not be measured . in what follows , we assume that the net contribution to the photonic @xmath2 from the other direct photon sources remains small , especially since the fragmentation photons with a positive @xmath2 should partially cancel the negative @xmath2 of the photons arising from parton - medium interactions @xcite .",
    "if other components are emitted isotropically we can roughly estimate how much they `` wash away '' the elliptic flow coming from thermal photons .",

    "[ fig : rhic v2 int ] together with the data obtained by the star collaboration @xcite using the 4-particle cumulant and lyz methods which should best reflect the elliptic flow relative to the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter .",
    "we have a fairly good description of the data also here , although the centrality dependence of the computed @xmath2 is not fully reproduced .",
    "we expect , however , that fine - tuning the initial density profile , invoking the monte carlo glauber model and possibly also event - by - event hydrodynamics ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as including viscous effects ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) will improve the agreement .",

    "we do this by fitting the measured photon @xmath3 spectrum . to study the uncertainties due to the chosen fit functions , we use two different forms .",

    "constraining our hydrodynamical modeling with the measured charged - hadron spectrum in @xmath1  tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc , we have predicted the thermal photon @xmath3 spectra and @xmath2 . according to our results , elliptic flow of thermal photons at the lhc and rhic",
    "are very similar in the few-@xmath3 region . for the determination of a possible thermal photon window , and consequently thermal photon @xmath2",
    ", it will be extremely interesting to see the direct photon data at the lhc .",
    "next , one should consider the effects of event - by - event density fluctuations @xcite on thermal photon elliptic flow . on the theoretical side",
    ", one would need a better understanding of how the degrees of freedom in the qgp would be best accounted for when computing thermal photon production , as well as a better control over the photon emission in the phase transition region .",
    "also the dissipative hydrodynamical effects to thermal photon production should be studied further , so far only the very first steps into this direction have been taken , see ref .",
