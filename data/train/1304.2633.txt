    "x - ray pulsars are neutron stars in binary systems accreting matter usually from a massive companion .",
    "these neutron stars have a sufficiently strong magnetic field , which channels accreting gas towards magnetic poles .",
    "strong magnetic field modifies the observed x - ray spectrum often manifesting as the line - like absorption features , the so - called cyclotron lines . such cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsf ) , sometimes also with harmonics",
    ", are observed in the spectra of several x - ray pulsars @xcite .    in some cases ,",
    "the luminosity related changes of the line energy are observed , suggesting that configuration of the line - forming region depends on the accretion rate .",
    "the line energy has been reported to be positively ( in relatively low - luminosity sources ; see @xcite ) and negatively - correlated with luminosity ( in high - luminosity sources ; see @xcite ) , as well as uncorrelated with it @xcite .",
    "this diversity is yet to be explained , and in this work we will focus only on the high - luminosity case .",
    "the negative correlation of the crsf energy with luminosity here is usually explained with the onset and growth of the accretion column at high luminosities @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the height of the column , and , therefore , the average displacement of the emission and the line - forming regions from the neutron star surface increase with luminosity .",
    "the magnetic field weakens rapidly with distance from the neutron star and , therefore , the crsf should shift to lower energies .",
    "the problem is , however , that the predicted shift is much larger than the observed one .",
    "the column height depends on luminosity almost linearly @xcite and the magnetic field weakens with distance as @xmath0 , and yet brightening by more than an order of magnitude yields at most 25% decrease in the crsf energy @xcite .",
    "moreover , large gradient of the magnetic field and of the accretion velocity are expected to smear out the line - like features making it difficult to explain why we observe crsfs at all .",
    "several authors @xcite considered variation of the magnetic field along the neutron star surface as a possibility to explain the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy with the pulse phase , which has similar magnitude as those associated with the luminosity changes .",
    "interaction of accreting plasma with the magnetosphere of the neutron star defines the geometry of the emission region , so one could imagine that a change in the accretion rate could also offset the location of the polar cap , leading to a change in the observed crsf energy .",
    "however , the observed variations would imply an unrealistically large shift of the hotspot location ( by 5060 degrees ) from the magnetic pole .",
    "furthermore , the observed change in the crsf energy in this case would imply a dramatic change in the pulse profile shape , which is not observed .",
    "on the other hand , a significant part of the column radiation should be intercepted by the stellar surface because of the relativistic beaming @xcite .",
    "small variations of the @xmath1-field strength over the surface ( only by a factor of two in the case of the dipole field ) would imply that the variations of the typical cyclotron energy are small .",
    "thus , it is more natural to assume that the line is formed in the atmosphere of the neutron star due to reflection of the intercepted radiation .",
    "increase in the mass accretion rate results in a larger luminosity , a higher column height and a larger illuminated part of the stellar surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath1-field decreases away from the magnetic poles , the cyclotron line energy should then decrease with the luminosity and a negative correlation between the luminosity and the cyclotron line energy is reproduced . here",
    "we discuss this scenario quantitatively and compare the model predictions with the data taking during a bright outburst of the transient x - ray pulsar v  0332 + 53 .",
    "let us start from the physical picture of the accretion on the magnetized neutron star following earlier papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is possible to distinguish the two regimes of accretion onto magnetized neutron stars depending on the mass accretion rates . at low accretion rate ,",
    "free - falling protons heat part of the neutron star surface near its magnetic poles , and these bright spots radiate energy in the x - ray range . at high accretion rate ,",
    "radiation pressure becomes significant and stops the infalling material above the neutron star surface in the radiation - dominated shock .",
    "below the shock , the matter slowly sinks down as the excess emission supporting the column escapes through the side walls .",
    "the column is expected to arise as soon as the luminosity exceeds a critical value @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron scattering opacity along the magnetic field , @xmath4 is the thomson opacity , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and the radius of the star .",
    "the footprint of the accretion column at the stellar surface is normally a thin ring or an arc , and @xmath7 is either circumference or the length of this arc .",
    "it is worth noticing that the optical depth across the column is of the order @xmath8 and @xmath9 is much smaller than the eddington luminosity for the whole star , but much larger than the eddington luminosity scaled to the area of the footprint of the accretion column .",
    "it depends on the accretion flow geometry and the magnetic field strength .",
    "the column height depends on the accretion rate @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xmath13 is the thickness of the accretion arc , and @xmath14 is a ratio of the x - ray pulsar luminosity to the limiting luminosity for the magnetized neutron star @xmath15 which corresponds to the column height of @xmath16 .",
    "the height , where matter stops , varies inside the accretion channel and depends on the distance from its borders because the radiation energy density drops off sharply towards the edge of the column @xcite .",
    "the height has its maximum value near the middle of the channel and decreases towards the borders .",
    "therefore , the radiation from the already stopped matter should pass through an outer layer of plasma falling at nearly the free - fall velocity @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 is the schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "these layers of the column are not supported by the radiation pressure , but are decelerated by radiative friction as discussed by @xcite .",
    "our assumption of the free - fall velocity of the outer layers probably overestimates their actual mean velocity , but the general properties of the model are not affected .",
    "the optical thickness of these layers is high enough to change significantly the angular distribution of the emergent radiation . as a result",
    ", the radiation is directed mainly towards the stellar surface due to the relativistic beaming . for the electron - scattering dominated column ,",
    "the angular distribution of the column luminosity in the laboratory frame is given by ( see appendix [ app : ls88 ] and @xcite ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the photon momentum and the velocity vector , @xmath21 is the lorentz factor , @xmath22 $ ] is the doppler factor , and @xmath23 is the normalization constant . the emission pattern becomes more isotropic at large @xmath24 , because of the radial dependence of the free - fall velocity .",
    "the energy release and the distribution of the emerging radiation flux along the accretion column depends on the details of radiation  matter interaction and is a complicated radiation - hydrodynamical problem .",
    "previous attempts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) considered one - dimensional models and/or did not account for the influence of the free - falling plasma .",
    "the actual problem is essentially 2d @xcite and has not been solved yet . for simplicity , we approximate the geometry of the accretion column by a thin stick on the magnetic pole .",
    "this approximation is reasonably accurate for high @xmath1-field pulsars up to @xmath25 .",
    "here we also assume that most energy is emitted in a region of characteristic scale @xmath26 situated above the neutron star surface at height @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , so @xmath28 for a homogeneously emitting column , or @xmath29 if all the energy is emitted within a thin shock at the top of the column .",
    "results weakly depend on the compactness of the star , which we fix here at @xmath30 ( corresponding to the radius of 13 km for a @xmath31 neutron star , consistent with the recent measurements from x - ray bursters , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "at a high accretion rate , the accretion column radiates the released gravitational energy of the falling matter through its sides .",
    "part of the radiation leaves the system directly and part of it is captured by the stellar surface .",
    "the fraction of the captured radiation @xmath32 depends on the height of the column , brightness distribution over the column , radiation beam pattern and the compactness of the star . in schwarzschild",
    "metric , for an isotropic , point - like source at radius @xmath24 , it is given by a simple formula ( see appendix [ app : bend ] ) : @xmath33 with @xmath34 in case of flat space - time , we can substitute @xmath35 .",
    "the captured fraction is slightly higher when light bending is accounted for .",
    "it drops from the maximal value of 0.5 to 0.1 when the source rises to @xmath16 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : part ] ) .    for the emission pattern given by equation ( [ eq : lsd ] ) and used in the following calculations , the captured fraction increases",
    "even further , because of the strong beaming towards the star ( see top curve in fig .  [ fig : part ] ) . for a higher source position , @xmath32 drops below the isotropic case at @xmath36 , because of a rather small beaming resulting from a smaller free - fall velocity and a factor @xmath37 , which reduces the radiation directed along the column .",
    "variations in the emission height lead also to a dramatic change in the distribution of the captured flux @xmath38 over the stellar surface .",
    "we illustrate this effect here by considering a homogeneously emitting column ( i.e. @xmath39 in equation  [ eq : lsd ] ) of various heights and @xmath40 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hcol ] ) .",
    "the details of the calculations can be found in appendix  [ app : bend ] . for a low column ,",
    "most of the emission hits the surface in the direct vicinity of the column at a co - latitude @xmath41 and the flux drops rapidly with distance from the column . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the flux @xmath38 diverges as @xmath42 , which is a consequence of our assumption of an infinitely thin column .",
    "when @xmath43 , the star is irradiated almost up to the equator and for even higher column , most of the stellar surface receives some flux . in a realistic pulsar ,",
    "the captured flux is a sum of the contribution from the two antipodal columns .",
    "radiation from the accretion column heats the neutron star surface layers to the compton temperature of radiation of a few kev . under the conditions of the neutron star atmosphere , the density is too small to produce any true absorption of the hard x - ray photons either in the continuum or at the cyclotron line energy .",
    "therefore the impinging radiation is mostly reflected . , where @xmath44 is the electron scattering opacity and @xmath45 is a true absorption opacity ( mainly free - free at temperatures of a few kev ) . a pure hydrogen neutron star atmosphere with temperature @xmath46 kev thermalizes about 4% of an external blackbody flux with the color temperature of 5 kev",
    ". at @xmath47 kev ,",
    "the absorption fraction is about 1% @xcite . ]",
    "the most important process affecting the spectrum of the reflected radiation is compton scattering .",
    "the cross - section for compton scattering in strong magnetic field is energy - dependent and has strong resonances at @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath1-field strength in units of the critical field strength @xmath50 g , @xmath51 is the angle between the field and photon momentum , and @xmath52 is the electron mass . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the resonance energies are @xmath54 .",
    "photons at the resonance energies can not penetrate deep into the atmosphere , they interact in the surface layers and scatter back . in the cyclotron line wings ,",
    "photons penetrate deeper into the atmosphere and scatter there with some energy shift .",
    "if they scatter into the resonance energy , they can not leave the atmosphere because of the larger optical depth there and escape instead in the line wings .",
    "thus , the lack of the photons near the resonance is not filled in .",
    "the absorption feature at the resonance energy and the emission features in the wings appear in the spectrum of the reflected radiation .",
    "the energy separation between the emission peaks can reach many doppler widths ( see @xcite , @xcite , sect .",
    "6.4 of @xcite and @xcite ) . because the emission lines are broad , they merge with the continuum and can not be easily separated . for resonant compton scattering in magnetic field ,",
    "the line is not symmetric and the red wing of the emission line is stronger , because of the recoil @xcite , which gives the relative photon energy shift of about @xmath55 .",
    "the absorption features at the harmonic energies can be even stronger , because the absorbed photons are mostly reemitted at the energy of the fundamental .",
    "the typical x - ray pulsar spectrum cuts off at @xmath563050 kev and therefore the contribution of the harmonics will be negligible in high - field pulsars ( as is the case of v  0332 + 53 ) .    neglecting the asymmetry in the line shape ,",
    "the centroid of the crsf in the reflected spectrum averaged over the surface and all angles is determined by the @xmath1-field strength weighted with the distribution of flux , @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hcol ] ) , and the line equivalent width , @xmath57 , over the neutron star surface : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the gravitational redshift .",
    "assuming that the line ew in the reflected radiation is constant over the surface , we can relate the cyclotron line centroid to the mean field as @xmath60 where @xmath61 variations of the magnetic field over the surface lead to the smearing of the line and its minimum width is then related to the magnetic field standard deviation : @xmath62 ^ 2   f(\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\ d\\theta } { \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\pi}f(\\theta)\\sin\\theta\\ d \\theta}.\\ ] ] if @xmath63 is smaller or comparable to the separation between the emission peaks , the crsf will remain strong in the total spectrum of the reflected radiation .    ) , ( b ) the magnetic field standard deviation given by equation ( [ eq : sigmab ] ) , and ( c ) the fraction of the captured luminosity on the @xmath64 ratio for @xmath65 .",

    "a more realistic lower limit on the line energy can be obtained assuming a uniformly illuminated surface , i.e. @xmath70 . in that case @xmath71 therefore , the line should not change its energy significantly and the model predicts the range for the line centroids of @xmath72 $ ] in agreement with observations @xcite .    in fig .",

    "the fitting procedure seems to indicate that the best description of the data is achieved for a column with most of the emission coming from its top .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the lower part is not emitting , but rather that this emission does not hit the neutron star surface .",
    "it is actually expected , because in the lower part of the column the optical depth of the falling plasma above the shock becomes smaller and the photons from the shock freely escape to the observer . furthermore , our results are based on the assumption of the constant with latitude equivalent width . in reality , the scattering opacity is a strong function of the angle between the photon momentum and the magnetic field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which necessarily will result in some latitude dependence and possibly will increase the line ew of the spectrum reflected from the equatorial region . in that case",

    "this is close to the luminosity , where large deviations of the model from the data are visible .",

    "this reduces the average `` observed '' @xmath1-field . in our model ,",

    ", the lower parts of the accretion column can also contribute . here",
    "the gradient of the magnetic field is not very large so that the line might not be smeared much and the radiation from the settling matter can penetrate through the free - falling gas , which is there already optically thin .",
    "thus , we expect a complex interplay between the lines formed in the column and the surface , that can affect the resulting line centroid . because no realistic 2d accretion column models have been published up to date , the answer is highly uncertain and outside of the scope of the present paper .",

    "strong beaming of the column radiation towards the surface by the outer layers of free - falling plasma guaranties that a significant fraction of the column emission is reflected from the surface .",
    "we argued that the reflected spectrum should have a strong crsf at the energy depending on the local magnetic field strength .",
    "small variations of the magnetic field along the surface imply that the line centroid energy can vary by at most 30% , from the value corresponding to the field at the pole to the whole surface - averaged field .",
    "changes in the pulsar luminosity are expected to correlate with the illuminated fraction of the stellar surface , and anti - correlate with the average magnetic field and , therefore , with the line centroid energy , exactly as observed during the outburst of the x - ray pulsar v  0332 + 53 .",
