    "the galactic centre ( gc ) hosts at least one clockwise rotating disc of o and wolf - rayet stars , most likely a result of the gravitational fragmentation of a gaseous accretion disc @xcite .",
    "these stars are located at projected distances of @xmath0 pc , and have an average age of @xmath1 myr @xcite .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations suggest that young stars forming in such discs can retain similar initial orbital eccentricities , which are often non - zero ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamics of stars in such eccentric discs can be very different from circular structures .",
    "in particular there exists an instability @xcite that occurs in coherently eccentric discs which are embedded in nuclear stellar clusters such as the one in our gc ( see review by schdel in this volume ) .",
    "this instability can propel stars to very high , or low , orbital eccentricities within @xmath2 myr , overcoming the long relaxational time scales associated with galactic nuclei .",
    "the background stellar cluster ( or cusp ) is an integral part of the instability . in this paper",
    "we identify the reasons for this , vary the density profile of the cluster to see the effect it has on the instability , and address the possible implications of the observed flattened density profile of the cusp of late - type stars in the gc @xcite .",
    "to describe the physics of the instability we work with a simplified template of a galactic nucleus .",
    "we consider a disc of stars with mass @xmath3 orbiting a mbh of mass @xmath4 .",
    "both are embedded in a power - law stellar cusp of mass @xmath5 .",
    "we make the assumptions that ( 1 ) @xmath6 , such that the apisidal precession of stellar orbits within the disc is driven by the cusp , and ( 2 ) initially each stellar eccentricity vector ( which points to periapse ) is aligned and similar in magnitude to those of the other stars in the disc . the stellar orbits precess with retrograde motion due to the presence of the cusp , i.e. , in the direction opposite to the orbital rotation of the stars .",
    "the precession time scales as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the period of a star with semi - major axis @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number of stars in the cusp within @xmath9 , @xmath11 is the individual mass of the stars , and @xmath12 is the power - law index for the space - density profile of the cusp @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    "let us assume a power - law index @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 is constant for all values of @xmath9 .",
    "the key element of the instability is that @xmath16 in equation ( [ eqn : t_prec ] ) is an increasing function of eccentricity , @xmath17 .",
    "the instability works as follows : a star that has a slightly more eccentric orbit than the average star in the disc consequently has a larger @xmath15 and lags behind in precession ; see figure ( [ f : torque_diagram ] ) .",
    "such a star feels a strong , coherent torque from the other stars in the disc , in the _ opposite _ direction of its angular momentum vector , @xmath18 . as a result ,",
    "its angular momentum decreases in magnitude , which is equivalent to saying that its eccentricity increases . in this way",
    ", very high eccentricities can be achieved .",
    "conversely , if a stellar orbit is slightly less eccentric than the average , it has a smaller @xmath15 and moves ahead in precession , thus experiencing a torque which decreases its eccentricity further below the average .",
    "the stellar orbits at the innermost radii of the disc ( i.e , with the smallest @xmath9 ) undergo the greatest fractional change in @xmath19 and hence are most likely to be pushed to extreme eccentricities .",
    "consequently , the precession rates of these orbits are important . recalling that @xmath20",
    ", we perform @xmath21-body simulations of an eccentric stellar disc to examine the effect of varying the index of the power - law slope of the cusp , @xmath12 , on the instability ; see figure ( [ f : gamma ] ) for examples where @xmath22 ( shallow cusp ) and @xmath23 ( steep cusp ) .",
    "the disc has a surface density profile @xmath24 , @xmath25 , a semi major axis distribution of @xmath26 pc and a smooth stellar cusp with @xmath27 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) . for @xmath28 ,",
    "due to the shallowness of the cusp , the innermost orbits lag behind in precession and are predisposed to being torqued to high @xmath29 orbits ; the instability is not as effective at generating low @xmath29 orbits .",
    "conversely , an increase in @xmath12 @xmath30 results in the innermost orbits precessing faster than the bulk of the stars and hence suppresses the generation of the highest @xmath29 orbits .",
    "a ( so far unknown ) percentage of stars in a disc should be formed in binary systems .",
    "these binaries can be propelled to high eccentricities by the eccentric disc instability , pass within the tidal radius of the mbh and be disrupted @xcite . in the gc , this mechanism may be responsible for producing both hypervelocity stars ( hvs ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and the s - stars @xcite .",
    "there are three lines of evidence to support this idea .",
    "( 1 ) the cusp of late - type stars in the gc is observed to have a flat surface density profile @xcite which , if it traces the underlying mass distribution , is maximally effective in producing high eccentricity orbits with the instability .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite find that the observed hvs are consistent with two planar structures , one alined with the inner edge of the clockwise disc . the hvs travel time from the gc to their current positions is too large ( 100 - 200 myr ) for them to have originated in the observed young disc but an older disc could potentially explain this feature .",
    "( 3 ) @xcite find a bimodal distribution of eccentricities in the young disc .",
    "the eccentric disc instability naturally produces a double - peaked eccentricity profile as the stars are pushed away from the average value .",
    "however , we must emphasize that a direct comparison to the observations is not possible at this time as the most eccentric stars in our simulations are the most highly inclined and would not be observed along the plane of the disc .",
