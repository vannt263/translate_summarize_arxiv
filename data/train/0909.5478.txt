    "for large particle systems , a principal tool of investigation is computer - based simulation . in a variety of problems",
    "the interaction of the particles is determined by a potential that is undefined at collisions .",
    "a common technique in dealing with the vector field singularities is to replace the potential with a smooth , or at least continuous , function .",
    "this procedure is called smoothing , or , in physics terminology , softening .",
    "smoothing was introduced in 1963 by s.j aarseth cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , in the context of numerical simulations of galaxies .",
    "since then , smoothing has became a commonly used technique in numerical modeling of large particle systems ( see for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the modifications induced by smoothing in large particle systems still remains a challenging task .",
    "a first step is to look at systems formed by two particles , but even in this simplified context , one is faced with difficulties ; see , for instance , the analysis presented in @xcite , where several conjectures concerning the convergence of the approximation methods are stated .    closely related to smoothing",
    "is the concept of regularization : they both target singularities in the flow as induced by the singularities in the vector field , but the resolution is different .",
    "smoothing modifies the vector field .",
    "regularization relies on a qualitative analysis of the phenomena near singularity and is achieved in two distinct steps .",
    "first , new parametrizations are applied , both time - dependent and -independent , leading to a _ regularized vector field _ , that is a vector field free of singularities . the phase space in the new coordinates",
    "is extended to include the singularity set , now blown - up into a physically fictitious and invariant manifold , usually called _ the collision manifold_. second , analysis of the flow on the extended phase space",
    "is performed in order to decide whether solutions asymptotically reaching the collision manifold can be matched to solutions asymptotically leaving the collision manifold , while preserving good behavior with respect to initial data .",
    "if such a matching is possible , then the flow may be extended ( at least continuously ) to include orbits ending / starting in collision .",
    "when this extension is performed , then the problem is said to be regularized .",
    "( for more on regularization , see @xcite or , from a more physical point of view , see @xcite . )",
    "we also mention the paper of bellenttini et al .",
    "@xcite , where regularization is seen from the different perspective of approximating collision solutions by solutions of the smoothed flow .",
    "while analyzing a system where the interaction is given by homogeneous potentials of the form @xmath9 @xmath1 the authors convey that their procedure leads to a larger set of regularizable problems than in the standard treatment . moreover , the smoothing chosen is _ irrelevant _ , as long as it provides a flow free of singularities .    in this paper",
    "we question the appropriateness of smoothing when motion both near and _ far _ from collision is under scrutiny .",
    "our analysis is performed within the class of homogeneous potentials to which a standard potential smoothing @xmath10 is applied . within negative energy levels , we focus on the topological equivalence of the non - smoothed and the smoothed flows outside the collision set .",
    "we show that for @xmath11 the two flows are _ not _ topologically equivalent and thus smoothing of the form ( [ smoothing - intro ] ) generates orbits that do not correspond to orbits of the real non - smoothed motion .",
    "for this case , we introduce the idea of smoothing the amended potential and show that , with such a modification , the two flows are topologically equivalent .    employing a technique similar to that of mcgehee @xcite",
    ", we choose to describe the dynamics in a parametrization where the non - smoothed flow is nonsingular and where the phase space is extended to include the collision set , now blown - up into a one - dimensional manifold ( this is the first step of regularization as described above ) .",
    "the orbits lie on compact three dimensional manifolds which are level sets of the energy integral for negative energy values .",
    "since the regularized vector field preserves the @xmath12 equivariance of the original problem , dynamics can be studied in a reduced three dimensional space . here",
    "orbits can be easily visualized as curves determined by the intersection of the two surface integrals , the energy and the angular momentum .",
    "this allows us to compare the orbital pictures of the non - smoothed versus the smoothed problem .",
    "while the non - smoothed reparametrized flow includes the orbits on the collision manifold , our analysis refers only to orbits outside of it and concerns only orbit topology .",
    "we do not refer to regularization of solutions ( the second step of regularization , as outlined above ) and we do not focus on issues related to approximating the non - smoothed solutions by smoothed ones .    the paper is organized as follows : we begin by briefly reviewing known facts about dynamics of two particle systems .",
    "next , we reparametrize the vector fields of the non - smoothed and smoothed problems such that the collision set of the non - smoothed problem is blown - up into the aforementioned collision manifold . using the @xmath12 symmetry to reduce the phase space to three dimensions",
    ", we study relative equilibria and examine symmetries of the reduced flow .",
    "further , we analyse and compare of the orbits of the non - smoothed and smoothed flows , drawing the conclusion that for @xmath13 the two flows are not topologically equivalent . in the last section",
    "we argue that for @xmath14 smoothing should be applied to both the potential and the rotational non - inertial term , leading to the idea of a smoothed amended potential .",
    "moreover , we show that when such a smoothing is applied , the topological equivalence of the non - smoothed and smoothed flows outside the collision set is achieved .",
    "consider the two degree of freedom hamiltonian system given by the system of first order ordinary differential equations : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath18 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath19 is a  smoothed \" potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a parameter and @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "the potential @xmath24 reduces to the classical homogeneous potential , in which case the vector field defined by ( [ eqmotion ] ) has a singularity at @xmath25 .",
    "since the system is hamiltonian , it is well known that the total energy is conserved .",
    "consequently , the level sets of @xmath26 are invariant under the flow of ( [ eqmotion ] ) @xmath27 due to radial symmetry , the angular momentum is conserved as well and we have : @xmath28 therefore the system has two independent first integrals in involution and it is integrable by the liouville - arnold theorem .",
    "since @xmath29 is real analytic , standard results of differential equation theory guarantee , for any initial data @xmath30 , the existence and uniqueness of an analytic solution defined on a maximal interval @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 , the solution is said to experience a singularity .",
    "for @xmath34 the singularity in the vector field induces singularities in the solution .",
    "singularities specific to particle systems are given by _",
    "collisions _ , which occur when @xmath35 as @xmath36 . in @xcite",
    ", mcgehee showed that collisions are the only possible singularities of ( [ eqmotion ] ) .",
    "he also proved that if @xmath37 then @xmath38 leads to a collision if and only if the angular momentum is zero ( that is @xmath39 ) and that if @xmath5 then the set of initial conditions leading to a collision is rather large , including for @xmath40 zones where the energy integral is negative .    the standard methodology in dealing with collisions in n - particle simulations is @xmath41 the potential by setting @xmath42 then the vector field ( [ eqmotion ] ) is real analytic for all initial data @xmath43 and the associated system of differential equations admits a unique global analytic solution .",
    "from now on , unless otherwise stated , the energy @xmath44 is assumed to take negative values .    using a technique similar to mcgehee",
    "@xcite we consider the following transformations @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 this transformation is a diffeomorphism from @xmath47 to itself ( where @xmath48 is the unit circle ) .",
    "further , we rescale the time parametrization by @xmath49 it is useful to keep in mind @xmath50 and @xmath51 are re - parametrised linear and angular momenta , respectively .",

    "first , the dynamics given by ( [ eqmcgehee ] ) has no singularity at @xmath57 ; in fact in the new coordinates the system extends analytically to all of @xmath58 and hence the equations of motion are regularized .",

    "note that , since each energy surface has the same boundary @xmath3 the set @xmath60 is independent of @xmath61 topologically , it is a two - dimensional manifold embedded in @xmath62 and it is diffeomorphic to a torus .",

    "further , orbits which previously passed close to collision now spend a long time near @xmath60 . by continuity with respect to initial data , the flow on collision manifold , although lacking physical meaning , provides useful information about collision and near - collision solutions .    for @xmath64 , using the energy relation ( [ energy - relation ] )",
    ", we deduce that on each @xmath65 the radial coordinate is bounded by : [ r - max ] 0rr^max_=. in physical space this means that the maximal distance in between points is bounded by the value @xmath66 .",
    "inequality ( [ r - max ] ) is meaningful provided @xmath67 is small enough , that is , if @xmath68 henceforth we will assume this condition is always satisfied .",

    "it is convenient to exploit the fact that @xmath90 does not appear explicitly in the equations .",
    "this allows us to reduce the four - dimensional phase space by factoring out the flow by @xmath91 the three dimensional reduced phase space is described by @xmath92 and a vector field given by : \\ {    l r=rv + v=u^2+v^2- + u=()uv .",

    "a direct verification shows that they are centres .",
