    "voltage noise has long been considered a problem .",
    "engineers have been concerned with bringing down noise in electric circuits for more than a century . the seminal work by johnson@xcite and nyquist@xcite on noise caused by thermal agitation of electric charge carriers ( nowadays called johnson - nyquist noise )",
    "was largely inspired by the problem caused by noise in telephone wires .",
    "the experimental work by johnson tested the earlier observations by engineers that noise increases with increasing resistance in the circuit and increasing temperature .",
    "he was able to show that there would always be a minimal amount of noise , beyond which reduction of the noise is not possible , thus providing a very practical tool for people working in the field . at the same time , the theoretical support for these predictions was given by nyquist .",
    "it is probably not a coincidence that , at the time of his research , nyquist worked for the american telephone and telegraph company .    as long",
    "as noise is frequency - independent , i.e. , white like johnson - nyquist noise , it is indeed often little more than a nuisance ( a notable exception to this is shot noise@xcite at large bias voltage ) .",
    "however , frequency - dependent , i.e. , colored noise can contain interesting information on the system at hand .",
    "for example , in a recent paper xiao _",
    "et al._@xcite show that , via the mechanism of spin pumping@xcite , a thermally agitated spin valve emits noisy currents with a colored power spectrum .",
    "they show that the peaks in the spectrum coincide with the precession frequency of the free ferromagnet of the spin valve .",
    "this opens up the possibility of an alternative measurement of the ferromagnetic resonance frequencies and damping , where one does not need to excite the system , but only needs to measure the voltage noise power spectrum . here",
    ", we see that properties of the noise contain information on the system .",
    "clearly , this proposal only works if the johnson - nyquist noise is not too large compared to the colored noise .",
    "not only precessing magnets in layered structures induce currents : recent theoretical work has increased interest in the inverse effect of current - driven domain - wall motion , whereby a moving domain wall induces an electric current@xcite .",
    "experimentally , this effect has been seen recently with field - driven domain walls in permalloy wires@xcite .",
    "these so - called spin motive forces ultimately arise from the same mechanism as spin pumping induced by the precessing magnet in a spin valve , i.e. , both involve dynamic magnetization that induces spin currents that are subsequently converted into a charge current .    in this paper , we study the currents induced by domain walls at nonzero temperature . in particular , we determine the ( colored ) power spectrum of the emitted currents due to a fluctuating domain wall , both in the case of an unpinned domain wall ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : unpinned ] ) , and in the case of a domain wall that is extrinsically pinned ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : pinned ] ) .",
    "we also compute the average current induced by a field - driven domain wall at nonzero temperature .",
    "we end in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] with a short discussion and , in particular , compare the magnitude of the colored noise obtained by us with the magnitude of the johnson - nyquist noise .",
    "in this section , we compute the power spectrum of current fluctuations due to spin motive forces that arise when a domain wall is thermally fluctuating .",
    "we consider separately the case of intrinsic and extrinsic pinning .",
    "the equations of motion for the position @xmath1 and the chirality @xmath2 of a rigid domain wall at nonzero temperature are given by@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is gilbert damping , @xmath5 is the hard - axis anisotropy , and @xmath6 is the domain - wall width , with @xmath7 the spin stiffness and @xmath8 the easy - axis anisotropy . we introduce a pinning force , denoted by @xmath9 , to account for irregularities in the material .",
    "we have assumed that the pinning potential only depends on the position of the domain wall .",
    "pinning sites turn out to be well - described by a potential that is quadratic in @xmath1 , such that we can take @xmath10@xcite .",
    "the gaussian stochastic forces @xmath11 describe thermal fluctuations and are determined by @xmath12 they obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite @xmath13 note that in this expression , the temperature @xmath14 is effectively reduced by the number of magnetic moments in the domain wall @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the cross - sectional area of the sample , and @xmath17 the lattice spacing . up to linear order in the coordinate @xmath2 , valid when @xmath18 , we can write the equations of motion in eqs .",

    "the normalization of the axes @xmath69 is the walker - breakdown field which is given by @xmath70 .",
    ", width=340 ]    the black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagecurrent ] is computed at zero temperature .",
    "it increases linearly with the field up to the walker - breakdown field @xmath71 , where it reaches a maximum current of @xmath72 .",

    "this curve is consistent with the curves obtained by one of us@xcite .",
    "there , an open circuit is treated where there is no current but a voltage .",
    "the voltage is related to the current as @xmath73 , such that indeed @xmath74 , where the normalization is defined as @xmath75 and the polarization is given by @xmath76 .",
    "increasing temperatures smoothen the peak around the walker - breakdown field , and for high temperatures , the peak vanishes altogether .",
    "therefore , for fields smaller than the walker - breakdown field and for small temperatures , the thermal fluctuations tend to decrease the average induced current",
    ". however , for higher temperatures , the current reverses and increases again . for fields sufficiently larger than the walker - breakdown field",
    ", we always find a slight increase of the current as a function of temperature .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : powerspectrum ] we computed power spectra for domain walls , both with and without extrinsic pinning . in ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "the spin transfer torque parameter has values @xmath54 , for which we see that for large pinning @xmath77 the power spectra only weakly depend on the spin transfer torque parameter @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , determination of @xmath0 is only possible for very small pinning potentials . in an ideally clean sample without extrinsic pinning the height and sign of the peak in the power spectrum",
    "can give a clear indication whether @xmath0 is smaller , ( approximately ) equal or larger than @xmath4 .    in order to perform these experiments ,",
    "the contributions due to the domain wall should not be completely overwhelmed by johnson - nyquist noise .",
    "the ratio of the peaks in our power spectrum and the johnson - nyquist noise determine the resolution of the experiment , and we want it to be at least of the order of a percent .",
    "we use that the resistance of the domain wall is small , and the johnson - nyquist noise is governed by the resistance of the wire . for a wire of length @xmath37 and cross - section @xmath16 , the power spectrum due to johnson - nyquist noise is given by @xmath78 . from section ( [ subsec :",
    "unpinned ] ) we can estimate the ratio of the height of the peak and the johnson - nyquist noise as @xmath79\\alpha a\\hbar ( \\sigma_\\uparrow+\\sigma_\\downarrow)/(4ln_{\\rm dw}{\\mathcal p}^2e^2)$ ] . to make a rough estimate of this ratio , we use @xmath80 such that @xmath81 for @xmath82 , a polarization @xmath83 and a conductivity @xmath84 .",
    "we then find @xmath85 , which shows that the wire length must satisfy @xmath86 in order to have a resolution of 1% .",
    "we therefore conclude that this effect at zero pinning is impossible to see in experiment , where wires are typically at least of the order of @xmath87 , i.e. , five orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we can try to increase the signal by turning on a pinning potential .",
    "insertion of the eigenfrequencies @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenfrequencies ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerspectrum ] ) shows us that we can maximally gain a factor @xmath88 for @xmath89 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : maximalpower ] .     and two values for @xmath0 .",
    "we checked that the curves do not differ significantly for different values for @xmath4 and therefore , the maximal value of the peaks in the power spectrum is @xmath90 .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath0 is negligible for large pinning .",
    "this curve was obtained by inserting the eigenfrequencies @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenfrequencies ] ) in the expression for the power spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerspectrum]).,width=321 ]    we can also still gain some resolution by considering a domain wall in a nanoconstriction , where the width can be as small as @xmath91nm@xcite .",
    "all this adds up to a resolution of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , with all parameter values set to ideal values it appears to be possible to observe our predictions in ferromagnetic metals , although the experimental challenges are big .    in a magnetic semiconductor like",
    "gamnas the number of magnetic moments in the domain wall is two orders of magnitude smaller than in a ferromagnetic conductor .",
    "this increases the ratio @xmath93 with a factor @xmath94 .",
    "however , the conductivity is also considerably smaller than that in a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "the conductivity of gamnas depends on many parameters , but a reasonable estimate is that it is at least about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of a metal , although usually even smaller .",
    "therefore , the advantage of a small number of magnetic moments is cancelled .",
    "another property , however , of gamnas is that the parameter @xmath0 can assume considerably higher values@xcite , up to @xmath95 .",
    "this does not influence the maximal value of the power spectrum , but it does dramatically increase the value for small pinning .",
    "note that there are contributions to the noise that we did not discuss in this article .",
    "for example , the time - dependent magnetic field caused by a moving domain wall will induce electric currents that contribute to the colored power spectrum . distinguishing such contributions from the spin motive forces was essential for the experimental results by yang _",
    "@xcite , and would also be important here .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : inducedcurrent ] , we calculated the current induced by a field - driven domain wall under the influence of temperature .",
    "we estimate that in ferromagnetic metals at room temperature that @xmath96 , which is indistinguishable from the zero - temperature curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagecurrent ] .",
    "however , for magnetic semiconductors , like gamnas , we find @xmath97 at @xmath98 , which corresponds to the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagecurrent ] .",
    "we therefore expect finite - temperature effects to be important in magnetic semiconductors like gamnas .",
