    "in this work we consider yet unknown properties of blackbody radiation , which are derived here from the bose - einstein ( be ) statistics . it is proven that a part of blackbody radiation energy is carried by coalescent photons .",
    "coalescent photons were first discovered by hong , ou and mandel in their seminal experiment  @xcite . since then , physics of coalescent photons",
    "has attracted growing attention fostered by the possibility of using coalescent photons in quantum information science and in the tests of fundamental concepts of quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "the properties of coalescent photons are usually analyzed theoretically on the basis of wave functions  @xcite .",
    "a  new approach to this problem proposed in this work is based on quantum statistics and provides new information on the physics of coalescent photons in blackbody radiation .    in this paper , @xmath1 coalescent photons",
    "are referred to as a @xmath1-photon cluster or a photon cluster of rank  @xmath1 .",
    "such terminology is justified because two coalescent photons were found to interact with a beamsplitter as if they were a single quantum object  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "this single quantum object , or a two - photon cluster , is either transmitted through the beam splitter , or reflected from it as a whole .",
    "it is shown in sections  [ sec : basic ideas]-[sec : cluster radiation spectra ] that the be statistics predicts the existence of photon clusters in thermal radiation and determines both the cluster statistics and radiation spectra for clusters of various ranks in a blackbody cavity .",
    "the existence of photon clusters in thermal radiation is a formal consequence of the fact that the be statistics is a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) , which is known to be a special case of _ compound poisson distribution _  @xcite .",
    "that means that the be statistics describes random events of two different types : elementary events and compound events , each compound event consisting of random number of elementary events .",

    "appendix  1 , a formal proof is given that photon clusters are inherent to the be statistics .",
    "section [ sec : composition of distributions ] shows that the be statistics is the result of superposition of two random processes , first , a random number of photon clusters entering a given phase - space volume ; second , a random number of photons contained in each cluster .",
    "such superposition of two random processes is known as a superposition of distributions .",
    "radiation spectra of photon clusters of various ranks in the blackbody cavity are found in section [ sec : cluster radiation spectra ] .",
    "it is shown that the sum of cluster radiation spectra taken over all cluster ranks ( from unity to infinity ) yields the planck s radiation law for blackbody radiation spectrum as a function of frequency ( @xmath9-spectrum ) .",
    "thus , it is shown that clusterization of photons does not affect the @xmath9-spectrum of blackbody radiation .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath9-spectrum , the @xmath10-spectrum of blackbody radiation is found to be sensitive to the process of photon clusterization , which shall inevitably result in some modification of the planck s radiation law for the @xmath10-spectrum of blackbody radiation .",
    "however , the actual degree of clusterization , as shown in section [ sec : cl_spectra_vs_lambda ] , leads to a minor modification of the planck s radiation law not exceeding 7.5% in its maximum for reasonable temperatures of blackbody radiation .",
    "main results of this work are discussed in conclusions ( section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "in this section we consider classical and quantum probabilities that @xmath11 particles are in some volume  @xmath12 .",
    "all phase - space volumes are assumed to be measured in the units of @xmath13 while three - dimensional volumes are measured in coherence volumes .",
    "therefore , all volumes in this article are dimensionless .      in the classical case , the probability that @xmath11 non - interacting particles are in volume @xmath12 is determined by the poisson statistics : @xmath14 where @xmath15 - is the average number of particles per unit volume .",
    "according to , the probability that no particles are in volume @xmath12 is @xmath16 therefore , can be written as @xmath17    in some theoretical considerations it is convenient to deal with relative probabilities defined as @xmath18 which for poisson statistics yields",
    "@xmath19 in this case @xmath20 will be proportional to  @xmath21 for any volume  @xmath12 .",
    "for example , relative probability that one particle is in an arbitrary volume  @xmath12 @xmath22 while the probability that two particles are in the same volume @xmath23 which is natural because classical particles enter the volume independently of each other .",
    "now let us consider a gas of classical particles that may stick together with some nonzero probability . in this case , two particles stuck together will form a new object that may be termed a two - particle `` molecule '' or a two - particle `` cluster '' . such molecules , like separate particles ,",
    "will enter the selected volume independently of each other .",
    "therefore , the probability that @xmath11 molecules are in volume @xmath12 must obey poisson statistics but with a different value of molecule density  @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , relative probability that one molecule is in volume @xmath12 should be proportional to @xmath12 by analogy with  .",
    "for this reason , if two _",
    "particles are in the selected volume then relative probability of such event is proportional to @xmath12 , while the same probability will be proportional to  @xmath25 if the two particles are separate",
    ". therefore , relative probability @xmath26 that two particles are in volume @xmath12 in the general case should be @xmath27 where the first term describes the probability that a two - particle molecule is in volume @xmath12 while the second term is responsible for the probability that two separate particles are in the said volume .",
    "if two particles are stuck together then they are not independent .",
    "therefore , formula signifies a departure from the classical poisson statistics , which is applicable to independent particles only .",
    "the polynomial character of relative probability as a function of volume indicates that some particles are stuck together and exist in the form of clusters , or molecules , while other particles remain separate .",
    "it is easy to show that quantum statistics yields for relative probability @xmath26 a non - classical dependence against volume similar to eq .  .",
    "indeed , the be statistics is usually considered for a single cell of phase space @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability that @xmath11 photons are in one coherence volume , @xmath24 is the average number of photons per coherence volume .",
    "designating quantum and classical probabilities by the same symbol @xmath30 may cause no confusion .    for arbitrary volume @xmath12 , the be statistics has the form : @xmath31 where    @xmath32    formula was derived by leonard mandel for an integer number of cells  @xcite .",
    "it was later shown in @xcite that the mandel s formula is valid for an arbitrary volume  @xmath12 including nonintegral number of coherence volumes .",
    "it is clear that the last expression in makes sense for any positive volume  @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 then becomes the usual expression for the be statistics in a single cell .    from",
    "we obtain the probability that no particles are in volume  @xmath12 @xmath35 here we have taken into account that if @xmath36 then @xmath37 for any  @xmath12 .    given and , relative probability that @xmath11 quantum particles are in volume  @xmath12 , by analogy with  ,",

    ".   for quantum particles is of the same form as eq .  .",
    "therefore , the volume dependence of relative probability in the be statistics suggests that some particles may stick together while other particles remain separate .",
    "the simplified analysis presented above is based on an intuitive understanding that if some particles are stuck together then this fact must influence relative probability as a function of volume . in the following section , a formal solution to this problem",
    "is discussed based on the properties of compound poisson distribution as presented in  @xcite .",
    "coalescence of particles in be statistics is a consequence of the fact that the be statistics coincides with a negative binomial distribution , which has the form @xmath42 where coefficients @xmath43 are defined in , parameters @xmath44 and @xmath12 must satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath33 , respectively . if parameter @xmath46 then coincides with the be statistics  .    according to @xcite",
    ", probability distribution is a special case of _ compound poisson distribution _ , so that describes random composite events ( like those shown in figure  [ fig : cpd ] ) .",
    "it was established in @xcite that these composite events obey poisson statistics @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average number of composite events per unit volume @xmath49 while probability @xmath50 , that a composite event consists of @xmath51 elementary events , is given by the logarithmic distribution @xmath52 in our notations , due to , equations - take the form @xmath53",
    "@xmath54    the above results , that were obtained in @xcite from the general theory of compound poisson distribution with respect to  , are derived in _",

    "such a new derivation provides an independent confirmation of these results .    in the case of quantum statistics , gives the average number of photon clusters per coherence volume ( if no distinction is made between clusters of different ranks ) , while is the probability that a photon cluster consists of @xmath51 photons , @xmath55  .",
    "the be statistics is thus the result of superposition of two random processes , first , a random number of photon clusters entering given phase - space volume , second , a random number of photons contained in each cluster .",
    "the first random process is described by the poisson statistics   while the second process is described by the logarithmic distribution  .",
    "such a superposition of two random processes is termed a _ composition of distributions _ and entails certain relation between the generating functions of the respective statistics .",
    "let us denote by @xmath56 the generating function of the be statistics  . by definition of generating function ,",
    "@xmath57 the generating function @xmath58 of poisson statistics is @xmath59 for generating function @xmath60 of logarithmic distribution we obtain : @xmath61 where a notation is introduced @xmath62    the be statistics is the result of composition of distributions and , so the generating functions of the statistics involved should satisfy  @xcite @xmath63.\\label{eq : p=00003dg(f)}\\ ] ]    substituting , and in we can verify that the latter equation becomes an identity @xmath64.\\label{eq : identity}\\ ] ] indeed , given and the right side of can be presented as @xmath65=\\exp\\left[\\ln\\left(1+w - wz\\right)^{-\\tau}\\right],\\ ] ] which is identical to the left side of  .",
    "this result for generating functions is another confirmation of correctness of equations , and in the be statistics .",
    "the result of measuring thermal radiation energy in a narrow frequency range will depend on what is actually measured ",
    "the number of photons ( i.e. the total radiation energy ) , or the number of clusters .",
    "total radiation energy can be measured , for example , by a bolometer , while the number of clusters can be measured by a photomultiplier tube since a single cluster should produce a single click in the photomultiplier .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to distinguish between the radiation spectrum measured by the bolometer and the spectrum measured by photomultiplier . in this section",
    ", we will focus on the energy spectrum of thermal radiation measured by a bolometer that , by assumption , absorbs the total radiation energy within the selected narrow frequency interval .",
    "thermal radiation in a blackbody cavity is usually presented as a sum of standing waves , or modes .",
    "each radiation mode of certain frequency , polarization and direction of propagation corresponds to a single phase - space cell .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle allows one to associate volume of @xmath66 with a single cell , or mode , in six - dimensional phase - space .",
    "this volume projects on the coherence volume in three dimensional space .",
    "let us find the mode - average number of photons @xmath67 belonging to the @xmath68-th rank clusters . using the average number of clusters @xmath48 per mode and probability @xmath69 that an arbitrary cluster consists of @xmath68 photons , we obtain for the average number of @xmath68-th rank clusters in a mode @xmath70 with and taken into account , eq .",
    "yields : @xmath71 this expression is always less than unity @xmath72 since @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , most often , for any integer @xmath74 there are no @xmath68-th rank clusters in a mode and only rarely there is one or several such clusters .",
    "now for the mode - average number of photons @xmath67 that belong to the @xmath68-th rank clusters we obtain @xmath75 which is also always less than unity . using the known expression for the degeneracy parameter @xmath24 in the be statistics ( see derivation of   in appendix  1 ) @xmath76 we obtain for @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy of single photon , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the energy of @xmath68-th rank cluster .    multiplying the mode - average number of photons belonging to the @xmath68-th rank clusters by the energy @xmath78 of a single photon we obtain @xmath81 which is the mode - average energy carried by @xmath68-th rank clusters .",
    "the mode - average energy of @xmath68-th rank cluster radiation times mode density yields energy density contained in @xmath68-th rank cluster radiation . before proceeding with this calculation",
    ", we have to realize what is the mode density in case of photon cluster radiation .",
    "we do not discuss here the mechanism of photon clusterization in blackbody radiation .",
    "in hom - type experiments ( for example , in  @xcite ) , indistinguishable photons stick together when they are scattered into two different modes by a beamsplitter . in the blackbody cavity ,",
    "indistinguishable photons stick together , most probably , due to multiple scattering on the cavity walls .",
    "however , the final result of clusterization process , irrespective of its mechanism , is clearly derived from the be statistics . with",
    "that it is important to note that when photons stick together their energy does not change , and hence their frequency remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , a photon cluster belongs to the same frequency range @xmath82 that contained photons before sticking . for this reason ,",
    "when photons stick together , their coherence length @xmath83 also remains unchanged .",
    "hence , a photon cluster coherence volume is the same as that of constituent photons .",
    "likewise , the same is the cluster mode density because it is simply the number of coherence volumes per unit volume .",
    "therefore , when calculating the mode density of photon cluster radiation , we can use the standard expression for mode density in a cavity @xmath84 which refers to the energy interval @xmath85 with two polarizations taken into account .",
    "now multiplying by we obtain the energy density attributable to the @xmath68-th rank photon cluster radiation at frequency  @xmath9 : @xmath86    this formula , written for a unit frequency interval @xmath87 , solves the problem of finding emission spectra of photon clusters of various ranks in the blackbody cavity .",
    "note that a photon cluster may have only two polarizations just like a single photon , which is taken into account in equation  .",
    "this is due to the fact that only indistinguishable photons , which have the same momentum ( in magnitude and direction ) and the same polarization , may stick together @xcite .",
    "all photons contained in a cluster must have the same polarization .",
    "summing up the energy density of photon cluster radiation as a geometric series over all possible ranks @xmath88 yields total radiation energy density @xmath89    equation is the standard planck s formula for radiation energy density in the blackbody cavity .",
    "hence , considerations presented above actually constitute a new method to derive the planck s radiation law based on the concept of cluster nature of blackbody radiation .",

    "the maximum photon cluster radiation energy shifts to a lower frequency .",

    "summing over all ranks @xmath68 , we obtain the usual stefan - boltzmann constant : @xmath94 where we took into account the known series sum @xmath95    it follows from that the areas under the curves @xmath96 in figure  [ fig : nu - spectra ] are related as @xmath97 .",
    "let us find the portion @xmath98 of total radiation energy that is carried by single photons . using and",
    ", we obtain @xmath99 in other words , about 92.4% of the total energy of blackbody radiation is carried by single photons .",
    "two - photon clusters , according to , account for 16 times less energy , or about 5.77% of the total energy of thermal radiation .",
    "let us define the degree of clusterization of blackbody radiation as @xmath100 which means that all multiphoton clusters ( starting with two - photon clusters ) transfer about 7.6% of thermal radiation energy .",
    "the clusterization degree of thermal radiation is a universal constant that does not depend on the blackbody temperature , nor does it depend on physical constants , such as the planck s constant or the speed of light .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - spectra ] , the energy of all photon clusters with ranks @xmath101 corresponds to the area enclosed between curve _",
    "@xmath93 _ and the planck s spectrum , which is shown by the solid black curve .",
    "it is noteworthy that the energy density of cluster radiation of arbitrary rank , according to , tends to a constant @xmath102 at any fixed frequency as the temperature increases to infinity @xmath103 .",
    "this constant is independent of cluster rank .",
    "therefore , at high temperature @xmath104 , cluster radiation of any rank less than @xmath105 has , by the order of magnitude , the same energy density .",
    "the total energy density of thermal radiation tends to infinity as @xmath103 only because the number of ranks of clusters effectively emitted at the selected frequency is increasing .      dividing the energy density of @xmath68-photon cluster radiation by @xmath106 yields the density of photons involved in the creation of @xmath68-photon clusters per unit frequency interval : @xmath107 integrating over frequency yields the total number of photons per unit volume that belong to @xmath68-photon clusters : @xmath108 which is the stefan - boltzmann law prototype for the total number of photons in @xmath68-photon clusters .",
    "wherefrom , by analogy with , one may calculate the portion of photons involved in photon clusters of ranks  @xmath101 : @xmath109 where @xmath0 is the total number of photons per unit volume in the blackbody cavity .",
    "it can be evaluated using with the zeta - function appearing in the result : @xmath110 it follows from that almost 17% of all photons in the universe are coalescent , i.e. belong to photon clusters of ranks  @xmath101 .",
    "the existence of photon clusters in blackbody radiation results in somewhat unexpected conclusions regarding the spectrum of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength  the spectrum turns out to be sensitive to photon clusterization .",
    "indeed , in order to switch from the frequency to the wavelength in the planck s formula , one typically makes use of the relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation : @xmath111 substituting in gives the standard planck s law for the energy density in blackbody cavity as a function of wavelength ( @xmath10-spectrum ) : @xmath112    however , is valid only for single photons , and invalid for coalescent photons .",
    "this is because the wavelength @xmath10 of a quantum particle is inversely proportional to its momentum @xmath44 in accordance with the de  broglie formula @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the wavelength @xmath114 of @xmath68-photon cluster is related to the wavelength @xmath10 of a constituent photon  as @xmath115 where @xmath44 is the momentum of single photon , @xmath116 is the momentum of @xmath68-photon cluster that consists of @xmath68 indistinguishable photons with the same momentum .",
    "hence , if @xmath68 photons stick together forming an @xmath68-photon cluster then , according to  , their wavelength becomes @xmath68  times smaller .",
    "this conclusion is of fundamental importance for the results discussed below .",
    "equation has been repeatedly confirmed in experiments with clusters of various ranks @xcite , so it can be considered as reliably established .",
    "it follows from that if photons stick together to make a photon cluster , it will appear in a mode with different wavelength .",
    "that will inevitably give rise to some modification of the planck s formula .",
    "no modification of planck s radiation law is required because , in contrast to photon wavelength , photon frequency is clusterization - insensitive .",

    "all functions for various cluster ranks have the same shape with the only difference being in amplitude , which is inversely proportional to the fourth power of cluster rank .",

    "for example , if there are three photons in the selected volume then @xmath138 is the probability that all three photons are stuck together into one three - photon cluster , @xmath139 is the probability that there are two clusters in volume  @xmath12 ( a two - photon cluster and a separate photon ) , and @xmath140 is the probability that three particles ( i.e. three separate photons ) are in volume  @xmath12 .",
    "it follows from the above that the sum of all elements of @xmath51-th column in gives the relative probability that @xmath51 arbitrary clusters are in volume  @xmath12 .",
    "we denote this quantity by  @xmath141 : @xmath142 obviously , @xmath143 because if there are no photons in volume @xmath12 then there are no photon clusters in this volume ( and vice versa ) .",
    "the summation in may start from zero since matrix @xmath144 is triangular ( the first @xmath51 elements in each column are zeros ) .    given the sum in",
    "can be reduced to the known generating function for the stirling numbers of the first kind  @xcite : @xmath145 which due to may be written as @xmath146 now , from and we obtain for the statistics of photon clusters @xmath147 where @xmath127 is the probability that @xmath51 arbitrary photon clusters ( regardless of their rank ) are in volume  @xmath12 .    note that in view of and statistics can be presented as @xmath148 which is a poisson statistics with parameter @xmath149 so we obtained results and , which have long been known in the theory of compound poisson distribution  @xcite .",
    "it follows from that @xmath48 is the average number of clusters ( of any rank ) in a coherence volume .",
    "parameter @xmath48 is always less than the mode - average number of photons @xmath24 because some photons are stuck together to form a photon cluster .",
    "hence , for the average number of photons per cluster we obtain @xmath150    this quantity is always greater than unity . in the high - frequency part of the spectrum ,",
    "the degeneracy parameter is small @xmath151 . in this limit ,",
    "as it follows from , there is about one photon per cluster .",
    "this means that in the uv limit , thermal radiation contains a vanishingly small number of multiphoton clusters .",
    "however , in the low - frequency limit , where @xmath152 , one cluster may contain a large number of photons .",
    "for example , if @xmath153 then , according to , one cluster contains on the average over 12 photons .",
    "thus , in the low - frequency part of the spectrum , thermal radiation consists mostly of multiphoton clusters .",
    "this situation is typical only for thermal radiation , as well as for the states of radiation field close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "there is every reason to believe that if the radiation source is far from thermodynamic equilibrium then the portion of multiphoton clusters in its radiation is small , while in the emission of strongly non - equilibrium light sources , such as lasers , multiphoton clusters are absent and all the clusters contain just a single photon .",
    "note that when indistinguishable photons stick together their energy does not change because there is no interaction between photons .",
    "therefore , the clusterization process can not affect the partition function @xmath154 of photon gas : @xmath155 where @xmath156 , and @xmath106 is the energy of one - photon excitation of radiation mode at frequency  @xmath9 .",
    "if the partition function is not sensitive to photon clusterization then the results obtained from the partition function are valid regardless of clusterization process .",
    "in particular , for the mean energy of mode excitation , taking into account , we obtain @xmath157 from where the average number of photons per mode is @xmath158    equations and yield @xmath159,\\label{eq : eta(nu , t)}\\ ] ] which is the mean number of photon clusters per mode as a function of the radiation frequency and blackbody temperature . comparing with we",
    "may conclude that the mode - average number of clusters @xmath160 is simply the logarithm of the partition function of the photon gas .",

    "if @xmath48 is the mode - average number of clusters then @xmath161 is the mode - average quantity of @xmath68-photon clusters . then @xmath162 is the mode - average number of photons contained in the @xmath68-photon clusters .",
    "therefore , the sum of @xmath162 over all ranks @xmath68 should give the mode - average number of photons : @xmath163 an infinite number of unknown quantities @xmath69 can be found from equation because the right - hand side of this equation is the known expandable function .",
    "indeed , eq . gives @xmath164 comparing this expression with we obtain @xmath165 this implies that @xmath166 for any frequency and temperature .",
    "therefore , can be expanded as @xmath167 in equation we change variables according  to @xmath168 which means that instead of the unknown quantities @xmath69 we will seek for  @xmath169 .    substituting and in   yields @xmath170 this equation , as well as , should hold identically for any  @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , equating the coefficients at equal powers of @xmath171 in the right and left sides of , we obtain the unknown coefficients : @xmath172 using , , and we obtain from  : @xmath173 this result coincides with , i.e. the problem of finding probabilities @xmath69 is solved .",
    "equation  , due to  , gives distribution of photon clusters by the number of constituent photons as a function of radiation frequency and blackbody temperature .",
    "the main results of appendix  1 may be summarized as follows : statistics of photon clusters and distribution of clusters by the number of constituent photons obtained in appendix  1 are fully consistent with the results obtained in @xcite for the negative binomial distribution as a special case of compound poisson distribution .",
