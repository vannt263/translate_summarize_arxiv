    "the mixing among fermions is one of the most mysterious aspects in particle physics . unlike the mixing matrix for quarks , the mixing among leptons displays an obvious regularity which is manifested in the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "it is well known that the mixing among fermions originates from the fact that the weak eigenstates of fermions ( quarks and leptons ) are not that of the mass hamiltonian , and the rotation from the weak basis to the mass basis results in the mixing matrix@xcite . as observed , the structures of the quark and lepton mixing matrices are so different , and it implies the mechanisms which determine their mass eigenstates would be different .",
    "lam suggests that a higher horizontal symmetry @xmath0 is broken into the tetrahedral @xmath1 and nematic @xmath2 sectors which correspond to the lepton and quark mixing respectively @xcite . definitely , it is only one of the possible structures which were discussed in literature .",
    "it is believed that there must be a higher symmetry at high energy scales and later it is broken during the evolution from high energy to the weak energy scale .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the lam s mechanism which determines an @xmath1 symmetry for the lepton mixing demands @xmath3 in the mixing matrix to be zero . and",
    "most of the proposed symmetries would result in the same zero-@xmath3 .",
    "however , the recent experiments of t2k@xcite , double - chooz @xcite , the daya - bay @xcite and reno@xcite collaborations all confirm that @xmath3 is not zero , but sizable as near @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that even though the lepton mixing matrix displays an approximate symmetric form , its original symmetry must be broken .",
    "the most plausible way to break the symmetry is to perturb the matrix to realize a practical lepton mixing matrix which is obtained by fitting the data while the unitarity of the matrix must be retained .",
    "the form of the perturbation may hint us the breaking mechanism which is important for understanding the nature .",
    "moreover , in the process of perturbing the matrix and comparing with data , we notice that several textures of the matrix are disfavored or marginally favored , even though a perturbative rotation would make them to be in marginal agreement with data ( see the text ) . that is the breaking mechanism .",
    "a careful analysis of the breaking ( indeed the perturbation ) indicates that one may have an opportunity to realize what original symmetric texture(s ) is more realistic , so would be able to trace back to high energy scale physics where the mixing originates",
    ". in particular , such a study about the patterns of perturbation may be useful for the future model builders .",
    "as well known , non - zero neutrino masses ; neutrino or lepton mixing and relatively small splitting among neutrino masses are the three conditions leading to the quantum mechanical phenomena : observable neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the mixing matrix in the lepton sector @xmath5 are named as the pontecorvo @xcite - maki - nakawaga - sakata @xcite ( pmns ) matrix @xmath6 which is a @xmath7 unitary matrix and can be parameterized via mixing angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath3 and one cp phase @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 . if neutrinos are majorana particles , there could be one additional matrix diag(@xmath14 ) , and since it is not revelent to neutrino oscillations at all , we ignore it in this work .",
