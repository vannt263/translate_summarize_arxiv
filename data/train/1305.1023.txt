    "there is growing observational evidence supporting that significant amount of material is blown away from accretion flow ( or disk ) onto black holes in forms of outflows and jets . in most cases ,",
    "the outflows are observed through blue - shifted absorption line features ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for galactic sources and @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for active galactic nuclei : agns ) .",
    "the estimated mass outflow rate sometimes exceeds the mass accretion rate to the central black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dense outflows can also produce compton upscattering soft photons from the underlying accretion flow , thereby making the emergent spectra harder ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the accretion flow is also affected by the presence of outflows ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the outflows are expected to produce deep impacts on their environments , since the outflows from black hole accretion flow , especially those from the innermost part of the flow , do carry large amount of mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "such powerful outflows may cause dynamical feedback which may trigger ( or quench ) star formation in surrounding interstellar and galactic medium , thus promoting metal enrichment ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "larger impacts are expected by higher luminosity objects with larger mass accretion rates .    at luminosities close to the eddington luminosity ,",
    "radiation energy density overcomes matter energy density so that radiation field can also be dynamically important ; radiation - driven outflow thus naturally arises .",
    "matter emits , absorbs , and scatters radiation , while radiation gives ( or removes ) energy and momentum to matter . in this way , matter and radiation",
    "are strongly coupled to each other . to study the outflow from luminous systems , we thus need to properly simulate strong coupling between matter and radiation .",
    "there are two basic lines of simulation study of outflow from luminous black hole accretion flow : hydrodynamic simulations of line - driven outflow by proga and collaborators ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of continuum - driven outflow by our group ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by performing the hydrodynamic simulations incorporating radiation force due to spectral lines ( line force ) into the equation of motion , @xcite have studied the dynamics of the line - driven outflow .",
    "they investigated the outflow properties above the disk by setting an optically thick and geometrically thin disk on the equatorial plane as a boundary condition .",
    "the radiation energy equation is not solved and the reprocessed photons are neglected .",
    "in contrast , our simulations self - consistently solve the accretion disks and the outflows , although our studies are restricted to the continuum - driven outflows . by solving radiation energy equation , we consider diffusive photons which suffer numerous thomson scattering .",
    "the continuum radiation force via diffusive photons drives outflows .    in traditional hydrodynamic ( or radiation - hydrodynamic ) models of accretion flows ,",
    "the disk viscosity , most important physical process in the disk theory , is described by the phenomenological @xmath8-viscosity model , although it should , in principle , be determined in accordance with magnetic field amplifications and dissipation within the flow . in other words ,",
    "global multi - dimensional radiaion - magnetohydrodynamic ( radiation - mhd ) simulations are necessary for understanding luminous black hole inflow - outflow system . under such considerations ,",
    "we have recently started global two - dimensional radiation - mhd simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter papers i and ii , respectively ) .",
    "the most important findings in those simulations are ubiquitous outflow in every mode of accretion flow and a new type of jet emerging at high luminosities ; magnetically collimated , radiation - pressure driven jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present study is to examine large - scale behaviour of continuum - driven outflow from supercritical ( or super - eddington ) accretion flows . for this purpose ,",
    "we run new simulation with a significantly increased simulation box size of @xmath9 , where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius ( note that it was only @xmath10 in papers ii ) . with this treatment",
    "we could find clumpy outflow structure in distant regions from the central black hole .",

    ", we overview the basic equations of our radiation - mhd simulations .",
    "we present the simulation results of clumpy outflow from supercritical accretion flows in section 3",
    ". the formation mechanisms of clumpy structure and the observational implications will be also discussed in section 4 .",

    "we adopt free boundary conditions at the upper and the outer boundaries , where we allow mass , momentum , and energy to free go out but nothing can enter the calculation box . at the inner boundary at @xmath68 around the black hole",
    "we remove all the mass , momentum , and energy which enter the inner zone inside this radius .",

    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 are the radiation heating rate and the radiation cooling rate , respectively . in the ambient media , in contrast , decoupling of matter and radiation occurs ( @xmath108 ) because of low matter density .",

    "in fact , the clumpy structure is not stationary but changes its shape in time .",
    "the gas particles that compose a clump are not the same .",
    "as we will see later the gas particles move faster than clumps and sometimes go through a clump .",
    "the two - dimensional contour plots shown in the previous section are useful to understand the clumpy patterns of the outflow , but it is not always easy to derive a typical size of the clumps and a mean separation between the clumps . for deriving such statistical quantities ,",
    "auto - correlation function ( acf ) is quite useful ( see appendix for the actual calculation method ) .",
    "( 85mm,55mm)figure2.eps    we show acfs of the matter density as a function of the typical height at the elapsed time of @xmath77 s in figure  [ fig : auto ] .",
    "the integration range of the acfs are @xmath109 for @xmath110 , @xmath111 for @xmath112@xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the acfs show several noteworthy features .",
    "first , no strong correlation is found at low altitudes , @xmath116 , meaning that no clumps there are .",
    "second , we see a sharp peak in the acfs for the data above @xmath95 , indicating that clumps are being formed at @xmath5",
    ". the typical clump size @xmath117 can be measured by the width of the central peak and is @xmath6 .",
    "third , the shape of acfs at higher @xmath118 do not change appreciable .",
    "this means , the clumps retain their shapes in the statistical sense even after moving upwards .",
    "the clump size is 25 times the grid spacing ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "we can thus conclude that each clump is well resolved in our simulations .",
    "to understand what the typical size of @xmath6 means physically , we estimate the optical depth of clumps for this length scale inserting typical clump density , @xmath102 g @xmath63 , finding @xmath120 that is , the clump size is on the order of one optical depth .",
    "this is a very important property of the clumps to consider their formation mechanism . here",
    ", we note that the electron scattering opacity dominates over the absorption ( free - free and bound - free ) opacities because of high gas temperature in the present simulation ; that is , @xmath121 .",
    "this relation quite generally holds in radiation - dominated accretion disks or flows .",
    "we here integrated acfs in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "note that clumps constitute an elongate shape along the outflow direction , which is obvious in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : rho_contour ] .",
    "this feature is also important to understand their physical formation mechanism .      to understand the physical cause of the clump formation ,",
    "we need to know the relationship between different physical quantities .",
    "the fact that the typical clump size corresponds to one optical depth indicates the relevant physical mechanism underlying the clump formation to be somehow related to radiation processes .",
    "let us check the magnitude and the direction of the radiation force per unit mass , @xmath122 , in the contour plot of the matter density , which is shown in figure  [ fig : rho - frad ] .",
    "anti - correlation between the matter density and the absolute magnitudes of the radiation force is clear in the clumpy outflow region ; i.e. , we see longer arrows ( representing stronger radiation force ) in the low - density regions ( with dark colors ) .",
    "it looks as if the radiative flux avoids dense ( clumpy ) regions and instead selectively pass through low - density channels between the clumps .",
    "the direction of the radiative flux seems to be responsible for the elongate shape of clumps .    to see this anti - correlation nature more explicitly , we plot in figure  [ fig : diag ] the values of matter density and radiation force in each grid point in the clumpy outflow region .",
    "again , the anti - correlation is clear .",
    "moreover , the relationships between theses two quantities are roughly expressed by a power - law , @xmath123 where a power - law index is found to be @xmath124 at @xmath125 g @xmath63 while @xmath126 at @xmath127 g @xmath63 .",
    "the break of the power - law index is understood in terms of the optical depth . in the optically thick media ,",
    "where the radiative diffusion approximation holds , the radiation flux is inversely proportional to the optical depth ( and , hence , the matter density ) ; i.e. , @xmath128 in the optically thin media where the streaming limit applies , on the other hand , the absolute value of the radiation force is given by @xmath129 we thus conclude that the break point of the power - law index indicates the boundary between optically thick and thin limit .",
    "as long as the radiation energy density @xmath33 is more or less homogeneous , which is actually the case , the radiation force is weaker in the optically thick medium , roughly inversely proportional to the optical depth , @xmath130 . in the perturbed radiation - supported atmosphere , the radiative flux tends to avoid high - density regions .",
    "( 85mm,55mm)figure3.eps    ( 85mm,55mm)figure4.eps    let us illustrate the anti - correlation in a somewhat different way .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross ] shows the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) between the matter density and the absolute magnitudes of radiation force per unit mass .",
    "the integration range is the same as figure  [ fig : auto ] .",
    "anti - correlation is expressed by the negative value at zero separation .",
    "we also notice that these anti - correlations actually evolve as the flow moves upward ( towards higher @xmath14 ) .      [",

    "we find that most gas elements go through the low gas density and the high gas temperature region before forming the clump .",
    "initially ( at @xmath142 s ) , this gas element was within the dense accretion flow , in which matter and radiation is strongly coupled ; i.e. , @xmath143 . at @xmath144@xmath145",
    "s , the decoupling occurs as the matter density decreases . finally , the hot gas element merges with pre - existed cold clump and cools down ( @xmath146 g @xmath63 ; @xmath147 k ) .",
    "( 85mm,55mm)figure5.eps    the gas temperature in the hot region ( inter - clump space ) is much larger than the radiation temperature due probably to compressional heating caused by weak shock .",
    "we have confirmed that kinematic energy density is comparable or slightly exceeds the thermal energy of gas .",
    "the coupling between the radiation and matter is so weak there that the radiative cooling can not be effective .",
    "( this contrasts with the case of clump region , in which tight coupling between the radiation and matter leads to the equal temperatures . )",
    "further , joule heating can assist the energy gain but can not be a main heating source , since we will show in section 4.2 that similar high temperatures are obtained by radiation - mhd simulations with no magnetic fields .",
    "the gas entropy is much higher in the hot region than that within the clumps .",
    "therefore , the hot region is buoyant .",
    "cautions should be taken here , however , since inverse - compton scattering is not considered in the present simulations .",
    "we expect somewhat lower temperature in the inter - blob space ( @xcite ) .    to see what force is responsible for the acceleration of the clumpy outflow , we compare the time - averaged forces over @xmath148@xmath149 s by using the data in figure  [ fig : traj ] ( see table  [ table : value ] ) . here , @xmath150 is the centrifugal force , @xmath151 is the lorenz force ( the magnetic - pressure force plus the tension force ) , @xmath152 is the gas - pressure force , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the radial and vertical components of the acceleration of the gas particle , respectively .",
    "we understand that the continuum radiation force is the driving force of the clumpy outflow .",

    "we thus further examine radiation - related instabilities . from equation ( [ thick ] ) and ( [ thin ] ) , radiation force could work as the positive feedback to grow the initial perturbation of the matter density , leading to a formation of inhomogeneous density pattern .",

    "the matter density decreases with an increase of the black hole mass , @xmath173 , for a fixed mass accretion rate .",
    "hence , the radiation force on the thomson scattering ( @xmath174 ) is dominant over the bound - free and free - free absorptions ( @xmath175 ) even in the case of massive holes .",
    "we actually performed the same radiation - mhd simulations for the case with a supermassive black hole ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the resultant density contours shown in figure  [ fig : agn ] clearly demonstrate the emergence of similar clumpy outflow patterns . by calculating acfs",
    ", we also confirmed that the typical clump size is @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath177 ( since @xmath178 while @xmath179 ) .",

    "they conclude that the underlying accretion flow should be supercritical and the associated outflow has clumpy structure with the variability on time - scales of several tens of seconds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite detected blueshifted fe k absorption lines from several agns whose the bolometric luminosities are estimated to be close to the eddington one , and suggested the presence of outflows from the central regions with mildly relativistic velocities , in the range @xmath180@xmath181 : so called ultra - fast outflows ( ufos ) .",
    "the ionization of the absorbers is in the range @xmath182@xmath183 erg cm s@xmath37 , and the column density is in the interval @xmath184@xmath185 @xmath186 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed spectral variability on time - scales of @xmath187 days ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) suggests that the outflows have clumpy structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us compare our results with these observational facts .",
    "it is important to note that once a clump passes across our line of sight , it will produce significant absorption , since the clump optical depth is about unity . to see how frequently such obscuration occurs",
    ", we calculate the spatial covering factor of the clumps , @xmath188 , by integrating the fraction of sky covered by each clump element .",
    "the factor can be derived by @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number density of the clump , @xmath191 is the location of the photosphere , and @xmath192 is the opening angle of clumpy outflow , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath193 , @xmath13 , @xmath194 ) are used . note that the clump size @xmath117 is not radius but diameter .",
    "the number density is given by @xmath195 where we use the following relation : the mass outflow rate @xmath196 ; the matter density of the outflow @xmath197 ; the unit mass of the clump @xmath198 ; the solid angle of the outflow @xmath199 .",
    "using equation ( [ tau_cl ] ) , the covering factor is estimated to be @xmath200 note that the covering factor does not depend on the black hole mass nor the size of the clump , as long as the clump size is expressed in terms of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we thus expect occasional obscuration of the light from the center by clumpy outflow , being thus in agreement with the observations .",
    "next , we estimate the photoionization parameter of clumps .",
    "the photoionization parameter , @xmath201 , is first proposed by @xcite and is expressed by @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the luminosity in the x - ray band . using the relation , @xmath204 , the photoionization parameter is estimated to be @xmath205 equation ( [ equ : photo ] ) indicates that clumpy outflows are mildly ionized ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the parameter does not explicitly depend on the black hole mass , strictly speaking , the luminosity in the x - ray band @xmath203 depends on the black hole mass ; @xmath206 for galactic sources and @xmath207 for agns . here",
    ", @xmath208 is the bolometric luminosity of the source .",
    "we assume @xmath209 in equation ( [ equ : photo ] ) .",
    "we thus expect line absorption features to be observed , in agreement with the observations",
    ".    finally , let us estimate the variability timescale of the clumpy outflow @xmath210 , which is given by @xmath211 we here assume that the angular momentum , which was @xmath212 at the photosphere ( at @xmath213 ) , is conserved even when it travels to the radius , @xmath193 .",
    "we thus estimate @xmath214 in good agreement with the observations of agn .",
    "this estimation can not explain the long variation timescales of the ulxs , on the order of several tens of seconds , unless the black hole is large ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the same mechanism applies to ulxs , they should contain supermassive black holes .",
    "the simulation results can account for the basic properties of the ufos of agn observed with x - ray .",
    "we should note , however , that we adopt gray approximation in the present simulations , meaning that we can not properly discuss the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "more detailed comparison with the observations , in terms of absorption spectra , is left for future issue .",
    "the broad - line region ( blr ) is a standard agn ingredient ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) : it is located inside the obscuring torus , above and below the accretion flow , and at a distance of parsec scale from the supermassive black hole .",
    "can we explain blr clouds by clumpy outflow ?",
    "from simulation data , the electron number density and the gas temperature of the clumps are estimated @xmath215 @xmath63 and @xmath216 k for @xmath176 , since the gas temperature is proportional to @xmath217 for radiation - dominated atomosphere .",
    "the volume filling factor is expressed by @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the number of clumps , and @xmath220 is the size of the blr . by using some typical values",
    ", we got the filling factor @xmath221 this value is consistent with the observational values of the blr clouds ( @xcite ) . in this estimation , we assumed that each clump keeps its form up to the distance of @xmath222 .",
    "we check if clumps survive by comparing various timescales .",
    "the gas temperature of the clumps hardly change due to the matter - radiation coupling occur in them , whereas that of the ambient media would remain to be hot since the radiative cooling can not be effective .",
    "the thermal conduction time scale , which is expressed by @xmath223 , is also much lager than the dynamical time scale , where @xmath224 is the spitzer conductivity coefficient .",
    "thus the clumps are expected to remain to large domain . to examine the stability of the clumps , the study with more larger simulation box is needed .",
    "the estimated typical values from the super - eddington outflow with the mass outflow rate of @xmath225 is in agreement with the observational facts .",
    "importantly , the photon luminosity of the underlying accretion flow is @xmath226 in spite of the large mass accretion and outflow rate , since the a large amount of photons inside the accretion flow is trapped and swallowd to the central black hole ( so - called the photon - tapping effect ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite attempts to explain the observations of type  i and ii agns based on the assumption that clumpy outflow gas originating from the accretion flow is distributed around luminous agn .",
    "his model can nicely explain the observed blr disappearance at low luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "although we only consider the continuum radiation force in the present study , line force may also work in luminous black hole inflow - outflow system .",
    "the line - driven force has been suggested to the one of the most promising mechanisms of agn outflow , since this can explain both acceleration and ionization states of the outflow materials ( @xcite ) .",
    "when matter absorbs uv photons , it gets momentum from them , and is accelerated towards the direction opposite to that the photons come from .",
    "the ionized x - ray photon distribution determines the outflow structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the sed of the underlying accretion flow strongly depends on the dynamics of line - driven outflows , it is unclear whether the line - driven mechanism does really work or not in the present study ( note that we assume the gray approximation for radiation transfer ) .",
    "@xcite performed the three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of line - driven wind , reporting the clumpy outflow structure due to the rotation shear .",
    "their finding is , however , independent of our work , in which radiation - hydronamical effects seem to play a critical role .",
    "the performance of the global radiation - mhd simulation of the line - driven outflow is future work .",
    "in this paper , we performed the two - dimensional global radiation - mhd simulations of supercritical accretion flows onto black holes in the larger computational box than our previous one and examined the properties of the outflow from the accretion flow in details . here",
    "are our new findings :    * the outflows associated with supercritical ( or super - eddington ) accretion flows have a clumpy structure above heights of @xmath5 .",
    "the typical clump size is @xmath6 , which corresponding to about one optical depth , and their shapes are slightly elongated along the outflow direction . in the clumpy outflow region , a clear anti - correlation is seen between matter density and the absolute value of radiation force per unit mass .",
    "* rayleigh - taylor instability is the most plausible cause of the clump formation , since the clumpy structure appears in the layer where upward radiation force overcomes downward gravity force .",
    "in addition , a radiation - hydrodynamic instability , which arises when radiation funnels through radiation - pressure supported atmosphere , may also help forming clumps of one optical depth .",
    "magnetic filed is not essential for this clumpy structure formation . * the spatial covering factor of the clumps",
    "are estimated @xmath7 for typical parameters of supercritical accretion flow , regardless of the black hole mass nor the size of the clump .",
    "this mean that presence of the occasional obscuration of the light from the center by clumpy outflow .",
    "for the clumpy outflows from supermassive black hole with @xmath176 , the photoionization parameter and the variability timescale of the clump are estimated @xmath227 erg cm s@xmath37 and @xmath228 day , in good agreement with the observational results . *",
    "if the clumps remain to parsec scale , the volume filling factor is estimated @xmath229 , and the clumpy outflow are consistent with the observational values of blr clouds .",
