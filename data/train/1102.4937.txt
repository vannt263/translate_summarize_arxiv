    "since the groundbreaking works of bachelier  @xcite , einstein  @xcite , and smoluchowski  @xcite , the theory of the brownian movement had been established as a central , recurrent theme in mathematics and physics . in the sequel",
    "the brownian phenomenon stimulated the development of many important ideas and theories .",
    "a complete description of the history is beyond the scope of this introduction , but in keywords we want to mention the following : the construction of wiener space  @xcite and wiener s approach of statistical mechanics and chaos  @xcite , it s theory of stochastic integration  @xcite and stochastic differential equations  @xcite , lvy s analysis of the fine structure of brownian motion and his theory of the brownian local time  @xcite , feynman s path integral  @xcite with its new view towards quantum mechanics , kac work on path integrals  @xcite . towards the middle of the last century there were the works by feller  @xcite and it ",
    "mckean  @xcite on brownian motions on intervals ( see also below ) , gross abstract wiener spaces  @xcite , nelson s work on functional integration and on the relation between quantum and stochastic dynamics  @xcite , giving new momentum to euclidean and to constructive quantum field theory , e.g.  @xcite and nonrelativistic quantum physics , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "further we want to mention the asymptotics of wiener integrals and large deviation theory  @xcite , the theory of dirichlet forms  @xcite , the development of the malliavin  @xcite and hida calculi  @xcite , and bismuth s approach to the atiyah ",
    "singer index theorem  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there were important developments in other fields , such as engineering , biology or mathematical finance , which were triggered by the theory of brownian motion .",
    "the present article is directly linked to the above quoted works by feller and it  mckean .",
    "so we want to sketch these in little more detail . in his pioneering articles",
    "@xcite , feller raised the problem of characterizing and constructing all brownian motions on a finite or on a semi - infinite interval . in the sequel this problem stimulated very important research in the field of stochastic processes , and the problem of constructing",
    "all such brownian motions found a complete solution in the work of it and mckean  @xcite via the combination of the theory of the local time of brownian motion  @xcite , and the theory of ( strong ) markov processes  @xcite .",
    "the central result of these investigations is that the most general brownian motion on the half line @xmath0 is determined by a generator which is ( one half times ) the laplace operator on @xmath0 with _ wentzell boundary conditions _ at the origin , i.e. , linear combinations of the function value with the values of the first and second derivative at the origin ( with coefficients satisfying certain restrictions , see below ) .",
    "it and mckean showed in  @xcite  partly based on the ideas of feller  @xcite  how to construct the paths of such motions : the boundary conditions are implemented by a combination of reflection at the origin with a slow down and killing , both on the scale of the local time at zero .",
    "the ideas contained this article became one of the roots of their highly influential book  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has been a growing interest in _ metric graphs _ , that is , piecewise linear spaces with singularities formed by the vertices of the graph .",
    "metric graphs arise naturally as models in many domains , such as physics , chemistry , computer science and engineering to mention just a few  we refer the interested reader to  @xcite for a review of such models and for further references",
    ". therefore it is natural to extend feller s problem to metric graphs .",
    "stochastic processes , in particular brownian motions and diffusions , on locally one - dimensional structures , notably on graphs and networks , have already been studied in a number of articles of which we want to mention  @xcite in this context .",
    "in previous articles  @xcite , two of the current authors studied the self - adjointness of laplace operators on metric graphs and discussed their spectra .",
    "this allowed a discussion of the associated quantum scattering matrices .",
    "further properties of the semigroups generated by laplace operators on metric graphs , including a selberg  type trace formula and the problem whether these semigroups are positivity preserving or contractive , have been studied in @xcite .",
    "this is one of the motivations of our present study since semigroups with these properties typically show up in markov processes .",
    "below we will return to this point , see remark  [ rem_sa_bc ] . the wave equation on metric graphs and",
    "its finite propagation speed has been discussed in  @xcite . for suitable laplacians free quantum fields on metric graphs satisfying the klein - gordon equation and einstein causality",
    "were constructed in  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    "the authors have constructed the paths of all possible brownian motions ( in the sense defined below ) on single vertex graphs using the well - known walsh process @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as the starting point .",
    "furthermore , the relation to the quantum mechanical scattering is discussed in detail there .",
    "the latter article provides an essential input for the construction of all possible brownian motions on a general metric graph in the sense of definition  [ def1i ] ( see below ) which we carry out here .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section  [ sect_mr ]",
    "we set up our framework and prove our main results : theorem  [ thm1i ] characterizes all possible brownian motions ( in the sense of definition  [ def1i ] ) on a metric graph  @xmath1 in terms of wentzell boundary conditions at the vertices .",
    "conversely , theorem  [ thm1ii ] states that for every choice of a set of wentzell boundary conditions at the vertices as described in theorem  [ thm1i ] , one can construct a brownian motion on  @xmath1 implementing these conditions .",
    "theorem  [ thm1i ] is proved in section  [ sect2 ] . as a preparation of the proof of theorem  [ thm1ii ] we consider in section  [ sect3 ]",
    "the situation where one is given two metric graphs @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath3 with brownian motions @xmath4 , @xmath4 in the sense of definition  [ def1i ] thereon . if one joins some of the external edges of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to form a new metric graph @xmath1 , it is shown how to construct the paths of a brownian motion @xmath5 on @xmath1 by appropriately gluing the paths of @xmath6 and @xmath4 together . theorem  [ thm1ii ] is proved in section  [ sect4 ] via the procedure of section  [ sect3 ] and the results in  @xcite , where the paths of brownian motions on star graphs are constructed with methods similar to those of feller  @xcite and it ",
    "mckean  @xcite .",
    "the article is concluded in section  [ sect5 ] by a discussion of the inclusion of tadpoles .",
    "furthermore , there two appendices : one with a technical result on the crossover times which is used in section  [ sect3 ] , the other about feller semigroups and resolvents .    given these results",
    ", it would be interesting to see whether known results for special cases of brownian motion or diffusions on metric graphs can be extended to all feller processes .",
    "for example , an arcsine law has been proved in  @xcite for the case of a walsh process on a single vertex graph , for the case of a general metric graph we refer to  @xcite ( for a discussion of local time distributions see also  @xcite ) . in a similar vein : what about occupation times on edges for the case of general ( local ) boundary conditions of the type   at the vertices ?",
    "can one say something about large deviations as done for example for brownian motions without killing and more generally for conservative diffusion processes in  @xcite ?",
    "what form does the it formula take in the case of a diffusion process on a metric graph with a generator subject to the boundary conditions  ?",

    "the metric @xmath8 is then defined in the canonical way as the length of a shortest path between two points along the _ edges _ ( formed by the intervals ) , and the length along each edge is measured with the usual metric on the real line .     with @xmath9 vertices , @xmath10 external and @xmath11 internal edges . ]    for a formal definition of metric graphs within the context of graph theory we refer the interested reader , e.g. , to  @xcite . within that context",

    "the first crucial problem is then to characterize the behavior of the stochastic process when it reaches one of the vertices of the graph @xmath1 , or in other words , the characterization of the boundary conditions at the vertices of the laplace operator which generates the stochastic process . we want to mention in passing that in an @xmath33-setting all boundary conditions for laplace operators on @xmath1 which make them self - adjoint have been characterized in  @xcite .",

    "that is , @xmath52 is simultaneously the initial and final vertex of @xmath751 : @xmath752 . figure  [ tad_i ] shows a metric graph with a tadpole attached to the vertex @xmath52 .     attached to @xmath52.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    let @xmath753 be the length of @xmath751 .",
    "assume furthermore , that we are given data @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath71 as in equations  , .",
    "we want to construct a brownian motion @xmath5 on @xmath1 the implementing boundary conditions corresponding to these data .",
    "let @xmath2 be the metric graph obtained from @xmath1 by replacing the tadpole by two external edges @xmath754 , @xmath755 , incident with @xmath52 .",
    "construct a brownian motion @xmath6 on @xmath2 corresponding to the data @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath71 as above .",
    "consider the real line @xmath756 as a single vertex graph @xmath3 with the origin as the vertex @xmath757 , and edges @xmath758 , @xmath759 which are isomorphic to @xmath760 , @xmath761 $ ] . take a walsh process @xmath4 on this graph which with probability @xmath749 chooses either edge for the next excursion when at the origin .",
    "then @xmath4 is just a `` skew '' brownian motion as in  @xcite which actually is not skew .",
    "that is , it is equivalent to a standard brownian motion on the real line",
    ".    now join @xmath2 and @xmath3 by connecting the pairs @xmath303 , @xmath304 via two new internal edges of length @xmath762 .",
    "denote the resulting metric graph by @xmath763 .",
    "figure  [ tad_ii ] shows this construction .     constructed from @xmath2 and @xmath3.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "+    construct a brownian motion @xmath764 on @xmath765 from @xmath6 and @xmath4 as in section  [ sect2 ] . by construction , @xmath764 is equivalent to a standard brownian motion in every neighborhood of @xmath757 which is small enough such that it does not include the vertex @xmath52 .",
    "therefore the additional vertex @xmath757 of @xmath1 does not yield any non - trivial boundary condition .",
    "thus , if we identify the open tadpole edge @xmath766 with the subset of @xmath3 isomorphic to @xmath767 , then we obtain a brownian motion @xmath5 on @xmath1 implementing the desired boundary conditions .",
    "obviously , any ( finite ) number of tadpoles can be handled in the same way .",
    "we recall from section  [ sect2 ] that in terms of the process @xmath394 the crossover times @xmath454 , @xmath430 , can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath394 start in @xmath387 .",

    "the paths of @xmath394 are continuous on @xmath31 , we get @xmath769 for all paths of @xmath394 .",
    "therefore @xmath770 holds .    in this appendix",
    "we prove the following    [ lema ] for every @xmath430 , @xmath454 is a stopping time relative to @xmath477 .",

    "then @xmath463 is finite , and therefore the set @xmath776 is non - empty .",
    "thus there exists a sequence @xmath777 in this set which decreases to @xmath463 .",
    "since @xmath460 is continuous on @xmath778 , it follows that @xmath779 . by assumption , @xmath780 , and therefore the continuity of @xmath460 on @xmath778 and @xmath781",

    "thus we find that @xmath790 , and therefore @xmath460 hits @xmath791 in the interval @xmath792 $ ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath793 , and hence @xmath775 , concluding the proof of the claim .",
    "next we prove by induction that for every @xmath430 , @xmath454 is an @xmath477stopping time .",
    "let @xmath794 . by   for every @xmath795 , @xmath796 clearly , @xmath797 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath798 is a deterministic set , @xmath799 is measurable from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , and therefore @xmath800 .",
    "hence @xmath801 .",
    "let @xmath140 , and write @xmath802 therefore @xmath803 , and hence @xmath471 is a stopping time relative to @xmath477",
    ".    now suppose that @xmath430 , @xmath533 , and that @xmath476 is an @xmath477stopping time . we show that for all @xmath772 , @xmath804 .",
    "first we remark that since @xmath1 is a separable metric space , the metric @xmath8 on @xmath1 is a measurable mapping from @xmath805 to @xmath806 .",
    "for example , this follows from theorem  i.1.10 in  @xcite , and the continuity of @xmath807 when @xmath808 is equipped with the product topology .",
    "consider @xmath809 .",
    "since @xmath394 has right continuous paths it is progressively measurable relative to @xmath477 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  i.4.8 ) ) .",
    "thus by proposition  i.4.9 in  @xcite it follows that @xmath810 is @xmath811measurable .",
    "consequently on @xmath812 , @xmath810 is @xmath813measurable .",
    "equation   reads @xmath814 it follows that @xmath804 , as claimed . but then @xmath815 for all @xmath445 is proved with the same argument as at the end of the discussion of the case @xmath794 .",
    "in this appendix we give an account of the feller property of semigroups and resolvents .",
    "the material here seems to be quite well - known , and our presentation of it owes very much to  @xcite , most notably the inversion formula for the laplace transform , equation   in connection with lemma  [ lem_b_6 ] . on the other hand , we were not able to locate a reference where the results are collected and stated in the form in which we employ them in the present paper .",
    "this applies in particular to the `` mixed '' forms of the statements ( iii)(vi ) in theorem  [ thm_b_3 ] , which we find especially convenient to use in this article .",
    "therefore we also provide proofs for some of the statements .",
    "assume that @xmath816 is a locally compact separable metric space with borel @xmath506algebra denoted by @xmath817 .",
    "@xmath818 denotes the space of bounded measurable real valued functions on @xmath819 , @xmath820 the subspace of continuous functions vanishing at infinity . @xmath818 and",
    "@xmath820 are equipped with the sup - norm @xmath821 .                        in the sequel",
    "we shall focus our attention on semigroups @xmath122 and resolvents @xmath220 associated with an @xmath819valued markov process , and which are _ a priori _ defined on @xmath818 .",
    "( in our notation , we shall not distinguish between @xmath122 and @xmath220 as defined on @xmath818 and their restrictions to @xmath820 . )",

    "@xmath836 denotes the expectation with respect to @xmath837 .",
    "we assume throughout that for every @xmath838 the mapping @xmath839 is measurable from @xmath840 into @xmath756 .",
    "the semigroup @xmath122 and resolvent @xmath220 associated with @xmath5 act on @xmath818 as follows . for @xmath838 , @xmath841 , @xmath140 , and @xmath233 set @xmath842 property  ( i ) of definitions  [ def_b_1 ] and [ def_b_2 ] is obviously satisfied .",
    "the semigroup property , ( ii ) in definition  [ def_b_1 ] , follows from the markov property of @xmath5 , and this in turn implies the resolvent equation , ( ii ) of definition  [ def_b_2 ] .",
    "moreover , it follows also from the markov property of @xmath5 that the semigroup and the resolvent commute . on the other hand , in general neither the property that @xmath122 or @xmath220 map @xmath820 into itself , nor the strong continuity property ( iii ) in definitions  [ def_b_1 ] , [ def_b_2 ] hold true on @xmath818 or on @xmath820 .",
    "if @xmath672 is a subspace of @xmath818 the resolvent equation shows that the image of @xmath672 under @xmath234 is independent of the choice of @xmath233 , and in the sequel we shall denote the image by @xmath843 .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity we shall write @xmath844 , if @xmath845 for all @xmath140 , @xmath832 .",
    "if strong continuity at @xmath855 has been shown , strong continuity at @xmath148 follows from the semigroup property of @xmath122 , and the fact that @xmath122 and @xmath220 commute .",
    "therefore it is enough to show strong continuity at @xmath855 .",
    "let @xmath838 , @xmath233 , @xmath148 , and consider for @xmath841 the following computation @xmath856 where we used fubini s theorem and the markov property of @xmath5 .",
    "thus we get the following estimation @xmath857 which converges to zero as @xmath188 decreases to zero .",
    "assume that @xmath863 for all @xmath140 , let @xmath832 , @xmath841 , and suppose that @xmath866 is a sequence converging in @xmath816 to @xmath113 .",
    "then a straightforward application of the dominated convergence theorem shows that for every @xmath233 , @xmath867 converges to @xmath868 .",
    "hence @xmath869 .",
    "now assume that that @xmath864 , for some and therefore for all @xmath233 , and that @xmath865 is dense in @xmath820 .",
    "consider @xmath870 , @xmath148 , and for @xmath233 define @xmath861 as in equation  . because @xmath871 and the series in formula   converges uniformly in @xmath841 ,",
    "we get @xmath872 . by lemma  [ lem_b_6 ]",
    ", we find that @xmath873 converges uniformly to @xmath862 as @xmath853 .",
    "hence @xmath845 . since @xmath874 is dense in @xmath820",

    "thus we obtain the following          `` ( i)@xmath882(ii ) '' assume that @xmath122 is feller . from lemma  [ lem_b_7 ]",
