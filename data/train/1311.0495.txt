    "thus , the equation can be named as `` the short wave model for the degasperisprocesi equation '' .",
    "interestingly , equation arises also in the theory of propagation of surface waves in _ deep _ water , see @xcite , as an asymptotic model for small - aspect - ratio waves .    for @xmath10 , reduces to the derivative burgers equation @xmath11 whereas for @xmath12 , reduces to the ( differentiated ) vakhnenko equation @xcite @xmath13 alternatively , with @xmath14 reduces to after the change of variables @xmath15 .",

    "therefore , it is more correct to name the `` ostrovsky  vakhnenko ( ov ) equation '' , as it is proposed in @xcite .",
    "equation is also known as the `` rotation - modified kdv equation '' ( rmkdv ) ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the literature cited there .",
    "the term @xmath19 reflects a small - scale dispersion whereas the term @xmath20 ( kept in the reduced form of the equation ) is responsible for a large - scale dispersion due to the influence of earth rotation ( the coriolis dispersion ) .",
    "in @xcite , hunter noted that equation in the form @xmath21 ( which corresponds to @xmath22 in ) arises as a short - wave limit of the rmkdv equation and , more generally , it is the canonical asymptotic equation for genuinely nonlinear waves that are non - dispersive as their wavelength tends to zero .",
