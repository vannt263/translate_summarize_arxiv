    "a quantum clock is an observable capable of measuring the time duration of a physical process in a quantum system@xcite .",
    "one of the major applications discussed in this context is the measurement of the traversal time of a quantum particle through a specific region in space@xcite : it can be performed by applying a field in this region , thereby inducing the evolution of the particle s internal states at a rate which is a known function of the field strength .",
    "if the field is weak enough , then its effect on the translational degrees of freedom of the particle is assumed to be negligible and the traversal time can then be deduced from the final internal state of the particle outside the region where the field takes effect .",
    "the first quantum clock to be discussed was based on the larmor spin precession of an electron in a magnetic field@xcite . by analogy",
    ", it was later proposed to use the faraday polarization rotation of an electromagnetic wave in a birefringent crystal@xcite or in a magneto - refractive medium@xcite as a clock for photon traversal times in dielectric structures . for both larmor precession and faraday polarization rotation ,",
    "the theoretical analysis led to the definition of a complex time variable@xcite . in the case of the larmor clock for electrons ,",
    "its real and imaginary parts measure the spin rotation perpendicular and parallel to the field , respectively . in the case of the faraday clock for photons , its real part",
    "measures the rotation of the main axis of polarization while its imaginary part measures the ellipticity of the resulting polarization .",
    "the works surveyed above have left certain open questions of fundamental importance : ( i ) how do the measured values of traversal times depend on the clock precision ?",
    "( ii ) what is the origin of the differences between traversal times measured by quantum clocks through different measuring schemes and how can they become superluminal@xcite ? ( iii ) whereas field quantization is _ not _ required for analyzing the evanescent - wave traversal ( tunneling ) of electromagnetic wavepackets through dielectrics or the corresponding traversal times , are there _ nonclassical _ properties of evanescent photons , which are affected by the precision of their internal quantum clock ?",
    "our purpose here is to elucidate the above questions for the faraday rotation clock .",
    "in section  [ sec : interf ] we use our previously introduced explanation that evanescent - wave transmission or tunneling results from _ destructive interference of internal traversal paths_@xcite , to show that _ the mere possibility of a time - measurement by an internal clock tends to affect this interference and thus increase the transmission_. we demonstrate this fundamental result for the transmission of photons through a layered dielectric medium with faraday rotation . in section",
    "[ sec : ttime ] we discuss different measuring schemes and their relevance to the traversal time problem .",
    "we show how superluminal traversal times measured by the clock are caused by strong destructive interference of traversal paths in the evanescent - wave ( tunneling ) regime . in section  [ sec : epr ] we discuss the effect of the faraday clock in a dielectric structure on _ two - photon correlations _ and show that _ correlations are not lost by the introduction of a faraday clock _",
    ", unless the filtering effect of the clock on circular polarizations is significant .",
    "the faraday effect of polarization rotation in a magneto - refractive medium is caused by the fact that the left - hand ( @xmath0 ) and right - hand ( @xmath1 ) circular polarization components with respect to an applied magnetic field have different refractive indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the medium .",
    "the linear polarizations @xmath4 are superpositions of the two circular polarizations with equal amplitudes .",
    "while propagating a distance @xmath5 through the medium , the two circular polarization states @xmath6 of light at frequency @xmath7 acquire different phases @xmath8 .",
    "if the transmission amplitudes of the two circular polarization states are equal , then a linearly polarized photon entering the medium will exit with another linear polarization rotated by an angle @xmath9 with respect to the initial one .",
    "however , if the transmission amplitudes are different for the two circular polarizations , then the transmitted photon is elliptically polarized . in the extreme case where only one circular - polarization component is transmitted , the medium acts as a perfect filter for circular polarizations .",
    "the use of the faraday effect as a quantum clock is based on the fact that the phase difference between the two circular - polarization states @xmath10 is proportional to the optical length @xmath11 in the medium , where @xmath12 is the mean refractive index .",
    "if the transmission probabilities of the two circular - polarization states are equal , then the polarization rotation of an initially linearly polarized photon is proportional to the time it spent in the medium , namely @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean velocity in the medium .    here",
    "we discuss the transmission of a photon through a magneto - refractive periodic dielectric structure ( `` a photonic band - gap structure '' ) .",
    "the structure is made of @xmath15 alternating dielectric layers @xmath16 and @xmath17 with dielectric constants @xmath18 and widths @xmath19 , so that the total width of the structure is @xmath20 . in the presence of a magnetic field each layer acquires different refractive indices for left- and right - circular polarizations .",
    "the faraday effect can measure the traversal time through the structure if the ratio @xmath21 is kept constant for the two layers .",
    "the transmitted wave at @xmath22 is a superposition of many partial waves corresponding to different patterns of internal reflections between the layers .",
    "each such pattern can be described as a path @xmath23 , traversing @xmath24 times the type 1 layers and @xmath25 times the type 2 layers , with a certain number of internal reflections between the layers , each having an amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "we can assume that in a weak magnetic field this inter - layer reflection amplitude is approximately the same for the two circular polarizations , and therefore the total amplitude of transmission along a certain path @xmath23 is equal for the two polarization states .",
    "it follows from the discussion above , that the polarization state of an initially linearly polarized photon traversing a certain path @xmath23 in the dielectric structure remains linear and is rotated by an angle @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illus ] .",
    "the state of the transmitted photon @xmath31 at @xmath32 is given by the superposition latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{tr}(x , t)\\rangle = e^{i\\omega(x - l)/c}\\sum_j c_j e^{i\\omega\\tau_j }    sum over amplitudes for transmission through paths @xmath23 , which traverse the two different dielectric layers @xmath24 and @xmath25 times and @xmath34 .",
    "the state @xmath35 with @xmath36 , is the linear polarization state @xmath37    a simpler form of the photon states is obtained by using the circular polarization basis . if the incident photon is in the state @xmath38 , then the transmitted photon state is @xmath39 \\label{psixt}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the spectral transmission function for a monochromatic wave with frequency @xmath7 .    since the two parts of the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ psixt ] ) are distinguishable by a circular polarizer , there is no interference between them and the total probability of the photon to be transmitted can be written as an _ average _ of the transmission probabilities of photons incident on a non - gyrotropic barrier at frequencies @xmath41 @xmath42   \\label{ptrw}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "this loss of interference leads to the enhancement of transmission probability in frequency bands where the transmission is low . in order to demonstrate this point ,",
    "notice that if @xmath44 is small compared to the scale of variation of @xmath45 , then we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ ptrw ] ) @xmath46 in frequency bands where the transmission is low , especially in the tunneling ( evanescent ) regime , the curvature @xmath47 is positive .",
    "we therefore find that the presence of the clock raises the transmission probability ( as compared to the same probability in the absence of a clock ) , because the destructive interference of traversal paths is progressively washed out as @xmath44 increases .",
    "what kind of measurement has to be performed in order to obtain a meaningful traversal time through the dielectric structure in fig .  [",
    "fig : illus ] ? if we were able to single out only transmitted photons that leave the structure in the exact state @xmath48 , then we could know what group of paths those photons went through and determine the exact traversal time through the dielectric structure .",
    "however , since the space of polarization states is spanned by only two orthogonal basis states , we are limited to the analysis of their detection probabilities rather than the determination of their state . in what follows we consider several alternative measuring schemes and discuss their relevance to the traversal time problem :    a. the first alternative is to measure the number of transmitted photons @xmath49 with linear polarization orthogonal to the initial polarization direction and compare it to the total number @xmath50 of transmitted photons .",
    "the traversal time @xmath51 can be defined by assuming that the polarization state of the photon after a time @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath53 we then find @xmath54 \\label{torth}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath55 this becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the phase of the transmission function @xmath58 .",
    "the variable @xmath51 is well known in the context of electron tunneling through potential barriers as `` the bttiker - landauer time''@xcite .",
    "b. the second alternative is to make a direct measurement of the phase difference between the two circular polarization components of the transmitted photons .",
    "this can be done by using a circular polarizer to separate the two components of the transmitted photons and then join them again by a beam - splitter as shown in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "if the optical length of one arm of this interferometer with respect to the other is adjustable , then the detection rate at one port of the beam - splitter as a function of the length difference between the arms satisfy the proportionality relation @xmath59}\\right|^2\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is an additional phase difference introduced by the optical components . the phase difference between the two polarization components",
    "is then given by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the value of @xmath63 which maximizes @xmath64 .",
    "the traversal time in the dielectric structure can then be extracted as @xmath65 which is the well - known value obtained in wavepacket measurements .    c. the third alternative is to scan the rotation angles of polarization from @xmath66 to @xmath67 by a linear polarizer , and define the peak rotation angle as the polarizer angle where the maximal number of counts is obtained . the counting probability for a polarizer at angle @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the maximal value of this function is obtained at @xmath71 , which corresponds to the same phase - time @xmath72 as given in eq .",
    "( [ tph ] ) . in a periodically - layered dielectric structure ,",
    "the evanescent - wave transmission probability @xmath73 is nearly symmetric with respect to the center of the forbidden band gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figuur](a ) ) and so are the traversal times ( [ torth1 ] ) and ( [ tph ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figuur](b ) ) . hence , @xmath74 if @xmath7 is at the band - gap center .    in ref .",
    "[ we ] we have shown that low transmission of a wavepacket together with abnormally short wavepacket peak traversal time is a consequence of _ destructive interference _ between consecutive partial transmitted wavepackets . in order to demonstrate the effects of interference on the clock read - out , we analyze the polarization state formed by a superposition of two linear polarization states that appear in eq .",
    "( [ psixt ] ) .",
    "consider the polarization state @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the amplitude of the @xmath23th transmitted wave .",

    "the main axis of the elliptic polarization state of the transmitted photons is given by the maximum overlap with a linear polarization state @xmath90 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ psitr : exp ] ) , we can express the probability function in eq .",
    "( [ ptheta1 ] ) as @xmath91 in order to obtain the value of @xmath92 we find the maximum of @xmath93 by equating its derivative to zero .",
    "we then obtain the following angle of the main axis of polarization @xmath94 if @xmath44 is very small , then @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the clock time then reads exactly the same as the mean wavepacket traversal time@xcite .",
    "hence , _ destructive interference _ between different terms @xmath97 gives rise to predominantly negative contributions @xmath98 , which _ cause the effect of abnormally short or even superluminal clock read - out times_.",
    "here we consider measurements that have never been discussed before , which pertain to non - local ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) correlations between entangled photons .",
    "suppose that we repeat the aspect experiment@xcite using a correlated pair of photons , but insert a faraday - rotating reflective structure ( of the kind depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : illus ] ) ) in the way of one of the photons ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "if the correlations between the transmitted photon and its twin are reduced , then the violation of bell s inequality is expected to be weakened . to what extent",
    "does the faraday clock affect the violation of the inequality ?",
    "let us take the initial state of the field to be @xmath99 where the first entry in the ket - vector refers to the state of the photon transmitted through the faraday - rotating structure and travelling to detector 1 and the second entry refers to the state of the photon travelling to detector 2 .    bell s inequality in the formulation of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) makes use of the correlation function@xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the measured intensity , the superscripts refer to intensity measured at detectors 1 and 2 and the signs @xmath102 refer to measurements with polarizer set at angles @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "since detector 1 measures only the fraction of photons transmitted through the faraday - rotating structure , the state of the photons near the detectors is given by @xmath105 .",
    "we then find @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and similarly for the other correlations .",
    "the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ chsh ] ) becomes @xmath108    the chsh inequality for measurements at polarizer angles @xmath109 is @xmath110    without a faraday rotating reflective structure we would have had @xmath111 but with a barrier the cosine term is shifted by a certain phase and multiplied by a factor which is _ always smaller or equal to unity _",
    "( fig .  [ demons ] ) .",
    "this factor is maximal when @xmath112 , namely , when the right- and the left - circular polarizations are not separated .",
    "this happens if @xmath44 is either very small ( weak clock ) or when @xmath7 _ lies at a symmetry point _",
    "( extremum ) of the @xmath73 curve , e.g. , if @xmath7 lies in _ the center of the band gap _ of the structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figuur](a ) ) .",
    "by contrast , if the two polarizations are not equivalent , @xmath113 is reduced and _ the violation of the inequality is diminished _ , indicating partial loss of the two - photon correlations .",
    "this loss of correlation is explained by the fact that the faraday - rotating structure acts as a filter for certain polarizations and thus the transmitted photons measured at detector 1 are a sub - ensemble of the original photons , which does not represent the polarization state of the initial photon population . when @xmath44 is small , it is easy to show from eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) that the maximal value of @xmath113 becomes @xmath114 where @xmath115 the variable @xmath116 measures the effectiveness of the faraday - rotating structure as a circular polarizer .",

    "although having units of time , it is difficult to refer to @xmath116 any meaning connected with time duration . however , it is possible to treat @xmath117 as a typical frequency scale over which the transmissivity of the dielectric barrier is significantly changed .",
    "we have analysed in this paper the transmission of photons through a layered dielectrtic medium with faraday rotation and have sketched measurements of their traversal times in order to elucidate possible quantum clock mechanisms in the evanescent - wave ( tunneling ) regime .",
    "for the first time , both single - photon and two - photon ( quantum electrodynamical ) properties have been considered in this context .",
    "destructive interference between different traversal paths has been shown to be the origin of the effect of abnormally short or even superluminal clock read - out times .",
    "several possible schemes have been proposed for traversal - time measurements based on the faraday - clock phase shifts .    in frequency bands where the transmission is low , especially in the tunneling ( evanescent - wave ) regime ,",
    "we have shown that the presence of the clock tends to wash out the destructive interference and thereby raise the transmission probability as compared to its counterpart in the absence of a clock .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing subject considered here are measurements of non - local correlations between two entangled photons with a faraday - rotation structure in the way of one of the photons .",
    "the two - photon correlation function @xmath113 , which is used to calculate the violation of bell s inequality , is shifted by a phase and multiplied by a factor which is always smaller or equal to unity ( figure  [ demons ] ) , as a result of the faraday rotation .",
