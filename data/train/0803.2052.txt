    "is that @xmath1 has a rational point over every extension of @xmath2 . in particular , for any place @xmath4 of @xmath2 , the curve @xmath1 should have a rational point over the completion @xmath5 of @xmath2 at @xmath4 .    for curves of genus",
    "@xmath6 , this is sufficient as well : if a genus @xmath6 curve @xmath1 has a rational point over every completion @xmath5 of @xmath2 , then @xmath3 is non - empty .",
    "a @xmath5-point of @xmath1 is referred to as a _ local _ point of @xmath1 at @xmath4 and a @xmath2-point of @xmath1 is called a _",
    "global _ point . for a genus @xmath6 curve @xmath1 ,",
    "having a local point everywhere ( at all places of @xmath2 ) implies having a global point .",
    "genus @xmath6 curves are said to obey the _ local - to - global _",
    "principle for points .",
    "the local - to - global principle is important from a computational point of view .",
    "one can decide in finite time whether a curve has points everywhere locally : for any curve @xmath1 over a number field @xmath2 , the set @xmath7 is nonempty for all places @xmath4 outside an explicitly determinable finite set @xmath8 . for the remaining places",
    "@xmath9 , one can decide in finite time if @xmath7 is non - empty as well .",
    "see @xcite for some algorithms , in particular a quite efficient algorithm for hyperelliptic curves .",
    "thus , whether a curve has points everywhere locally can actually be decided in finite time .",
    "it is well known that curves of genus greater than @xmath6 do not always obey the local - to - global principle .",
    "most proofs of this phenomenon are based on the fact that curves of positive genus can have unramified galois - covers .",
    "in fact , if a curve  @xmath1 of positive genus has a rational point  @xmath10 , then the abel - jacobi map allows us to consider @xmath1 as a non - singular subvariety of its jacobian variety  @xmath11 .",
    "since the map @xmath12 is unramified , the pull - back @xmath13 yields an unramified cover of @xmath1 that has a rational point mapping to  @xmath10 .",
    "more generally , an _ @xmath14-cover _ of  @xmath1 is a cover that is isomorphic to one of this form over an algebraic closure @xmath15 of  @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if one can show that an algebraic curve @xmath1 does not have @xmath14-covers that have a rational point , then it follows that @xmath1 has no rational points .",
    "even though @xmath1 may have points everywhere locally , it is possible that on every cover , rational points can be ruled out by local conditions .",
    "the major content of this paper is inspired by the following well - known observation .",
    "let @xmath16 be an unramified cover of a curve @xmath1 over a number field @xmath2 that is galois over an algebraic closure @xmath15 of  @xmath2 .",
    "it is a standard fact , going back to chevalley and weil @xcite that there is a finite collection of twists @xmath17 of the given cover @xmath18 such that any rational point on @xmath1 has a rational pre - image on one of the covers @xmath19 .",
    "we call such a set of covers a _ covering collection_. furthermore , at least in principle , such a finite collection of covers is explicitly computable given a cover @xmath16 .",
    "thus , one approach for testing solvability of a curve @xmath1 that has points everywhere locally is :    1 .   fix @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   construct an @xmath14-cover @xmath21 of @xmath1 . if no such covers exist , then @xmath3 is empty .",
    "3 .   determine a covering collection associated to @xmath22 .",
    "test each member of the covering collection for local solvability .",
    "if none of the members has points everywhere locally then no curve in the covering collection has any rational points , and @xmath1 has no rational points either .",
    "each of the covers might have a local obstruction to having rational points , while the underlying curve @xmath1 has none .",
    "thus the procedure sketched above can actually prove that a curve does not obey the local - to - global principle for points .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion , including the theoretical background and some links to the brauer - manin obstruction against rational points .    in the present article",
    "we discuss a relatively efficient way of carrying out the procedure sketched above for hyperelliptic curves .",
    "we consider unramified covers @xmath23 over  @xmath2 such that for an algebraic closure @xmath15 of @xmath2 we have that @xmath24({\\overline{k}})$ ] as @xmath25-modules .",
    "these are exactly the _ two - covers _ of @xmath1 over @xmath2 .",
    "we write @xmath26 for the set of isomorphism classes of two - covers of @xmath1 over @xmath2 .",
    "our claim to efficiency stems from the fact that we avoid explicitly constructing a covering collection .",
    "in fact , the method can be described without any reference to unramified covers , see section  [ sec : definition ] .",
    "instead , we determine an abstract object that ( almost ) classifies the isomorphism classes of two - covers .",
    "see section  [ sec : geom ] for how to construct the covers explicitly from the information provided by the algorithm .",
    "we observe that for any field extension @xmath27 there is a well - defined map @xmath28 by sending a point to the two - cover that has an @xmath29-rational point above it . for completions @xmath30 ,",
    "we show that this map is locally constant : if two points @xmath31 lie sufficiently close , then they lift to the same two - cover .",
    "this allows us to explicitly compute the @xmath5-isomorphism classes of two - covers that have points locally at @xmath4 .",
    "we can then piece together this information to obtain the global isomorphism classes of two - covers that have points everywhere locally .",
    "we define @xmath32 to be the set of everywhere",
    "locally solvable two - covers of @xmath1 .",
    "the algorithm computes a related object , that we denote by @xmath33 , which is a quotient of @xmath34 .",
    "it classifies everywhere locally solvable two - covers , up to an easily understood equivalence .",
    "since any curve @xmath1 with a rational point admits a globally and hence everywhere locally solvable two - cover , @xmath35 implies that @xmath3 is empty .    a priori ,",
    "the elements of @xmath33 represent two - covers that have a model of a certain form ( described in section  [ sec : geom ] ) , but we will prove that every two - cover that has points everywhere locally does have such a model , see theorem  [ thm : twocovers ] below .    in section  [ sec :",
    "noratpoints ] we illustrate how the algorithm presented in sections  [ sec : localmu ] , [ sec : real ] , and [ sec : selfake ] can be used to show that a hyperelliptic curve has no rational points .",
    "this method was also used in a large scale project @xcite to determine the solvability of all genus @xmath36 curves with a model of the form @xmath37 in section  [ sec : statistics ] we describe some statistics that illustrate how frequently one would expect that @xmath35 for curves of genus @xmath36 .",
    "section  [ sec : ratpoints ] shows how information obtained on @xmath33 can be used for determining the rational points on curves if @xmath3 is non - empty .",

    "we find ( unsurprisingly ) that we recover well - known algorithms for performing @xmath36-descents and second @xmath36-descents on elliptic curves @xcite .",
    "a practical benefit of this observation is that to our knowledge , nobody has bothered to implement second two - descent over arbitrary number fields , whereas our implementation in magma @xcite ( which is available for download at @xcite ) can immediately be used .",

    "this means that it is possible that @xmath519 for all relevant @xmath110 and thus that chabauty s method can be applied to each @xmath19 .",
    "the curve @xmath19 is usually of too high genus to do computations with directly .",
    "however , over @xmath15 , the curve @xmath19 covers many hyperelliptic curves besides @xmath1 . these arise from factorisations",
    "@xmath520 , where at least one of @xmath521 has even degree .",

    "we write @xmath523 it is straightforward to see that , for every @xmath110 , there is a value of @xmath524 such that , over @xmath29 , we have the diagram @xmath525\\ar[dd]\\ar[ddr]\\\\ \\\\ e_\\gamma\\ar[dr]_x&c\\ar[d]^x&e'_\\gamma\\ar[dl]^x\\\\ & { \\mathbb{p}}^1 } \\ ] ] note that @xmath234 maps to @xmath3 and from there to @xmath526 .",
    "therefore , @xmath234 maps to @xmath527 and in order to find which of those points correspond to points in @xmath3 we only have to find which points in @xmath528 lift to @xmath3 .",
    "there is ample literature on how to perform this last step @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of finding the relevant values for @xmath529 has largely been glanced over .",
    "this is mainly because in any particular situation , it is quite easy to write down a finite collection of candidates for @xmath529 and then test , for every place @xmath163 of @xmath2 and any extension @xmath151 of @xmath163 to @xmath29 , for each value if @xmath530 is non - empty . in fact , this is quite doable for the fibre product @xmath531 too ( see @xcite*appendix  a ) .",
    "however , the smallest set of values for @xmath529 we can hope to arrive at through local means , is @xmath532 also , note that the degree of @xmath29 over @xmath2 will usually be larger than the degree of @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath514 where @xmath65 is a sextic with galois group @xmath533 over @xmath2 , the the field @xmath29 over which @xmath123 factors as a quadratic times a quartic is of degree @xmath534 , while @xmath46 is of degree @xmath535 .",
    "hence , from a computational point of view it is interesting to avoid as much computation as possible in @xmath29 .",
    "the map @xmath536 is in fact straightforward to compute , given representatives @xmath537/(f(x))$ ] .",
    "let @xmath538=l[x]/(g(x))$ ] .",
    "then there is a natural @xmath2-algebra homomorphism @xmath539 $ ] given by @xmath540 . using these definitions we have @xmath541/l}(j(\\delta)).\\ ] ]",
    "while the degree of @xmath538 $ ] is probably quite high , we only need to compute a norm with respect to it .",
    "this is not such an expensive operation .",
    "the following example illustrates how the computation of the fake @xmath36-selmer set fits in with the standard methods for determining the rational points on hyperelliptic curves .",
    "let @xmath542 then @xmath543 .",
    "first we observe that @xmath1 covers two elliptic curves , @xmath544 and @xmath545 , but each of these curves has infinitely many rational points .",
    "when we apply to this curve , we find that @xmath490 is represented by @xmath546 , so it is equal to @xmath547 .",
    "putting @xmath548 , where @xmath549 , we obtain the factorization : @xmath550 we choose @xmath551 and @xmath552 .",
    "we find that @xmath553 and write @xmath554 .",
    "any point @xmath555 must correspond to a point @xmath556 with @xmath557 .",
    "the curve @xmath558 is isomorphic over @xmath29 to the elliptic curve @xmath559 which has @xmath560 .",
    "this makes methods as described in @xcite applicable and a @xmath163-adic argument at @xmath561 proves that @xmath562 .",
    "in this section we illustrate how the computation of @xmath33 yields interesting results even when @xmath1 is a genus @xmath0 double cover of @xmath99 . we recover well - known algorithms for doing @xmath36-descents and second @xmath36-descents on elliptic curves . to our knowledge",
    ", nobody took the effort yet of implementing second descent on elliptic curves over number fields , whereas our implementation @xcite in magma for computing @xmath33 does work if @xmath2 is a general number field .",
    "we illustrate the use by giving an example of an elliptic curve over @xmath38 with non - trivial tate - shafarevich group .",
    "if we have a genus @xmath0 curve of the form @xmath563 then @xmath564 is equal to the usual @xmath36-selmer group of @xmath558 . in this case , the algorithm presented in section  [ sec : selfake ] could be improved by using the fact that the sets computed in are groups of known size .",
    "one recovers an algorithm to compute the @xmath36-selmer group of an elliptic curve very similar to @xcite .    following section  [ sec : geom ] , for every @xmath565 , we can write down an everywhere locally solvable cover @xmath19 .",
    "the model we obtain is the intersection of two quadrics in @xmath566 .",
    "the pencil of quadrics cutting out @xmath19 contains a singular quadric @xmath567 over @xmath2 , however . since @xmath568 is non - empty for every @xmath163 , the hasse principle for conics mandates that @xmath567 contains a line over @xmath2 and thus that the lines on @xmath567 form a @xmath99 over @xmath2 . by sending a point on @xmath19 to the line on @xmath567 that goes through that point ,",
    "we realise @xmath19 as a double cover of a @xmath99 and we obtain a model of the form @xmath569 where we know that @xmath570 is everywhere locally solvable .    note that @xmath570 itself is again a curve of genus @xmath0 .",
    "we can compute @xmath571 in this case as well .",
    "the data obtained is the same as that obtained by doing a second @xmath36-descent , along the lines of @xcite . in this case too , the algorithm could be optimised a bit by observing that @xmath572 maps surjectively to the fiber over @xmath110 with respect to @xmath573 ; the fibers of the map @xmath574 are isomorphic to @xmath575/2e(k)[4]$ ] ( see section  6.1.3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath572 is either empty or has a known cardinality .",
    "similarly , in , the fact that the set @xmath141 carries a @xmath576-action and is of known cardinality can speed up the computation immensely .",
    "let @xmath577 and consider @xmath578 then @xmath579 is non - trivial .",
    "we find that @xmath580 is in @xmath581 .",
    "the corresponding cover of @xmath558 can be given by the model @xmath582 it turns out that @xmath33 is empty .",
    "hence , it follows that @xmath565 is not in the image of @xmath583 and therefore represents a non - trivial member of @xmath584 $ ] .",
    "in fact , we have shown that @xmath110 represents an element of @xmath579 that is not divisible by @xmath36 .",
    "it is natural to ask how often we should expect that @xmath33 is empty if @xmath3 is .",
    "this is equivalent to determining what proportion of curves @xmath1 over @xmath2 have an everywhere locally solvable two - cover ( see theorem  [ thm : twocovers ] ) . to quantify this question ,",
    "let us limit ourselves to curves @xmath1 of genus @xmath36 and @xmath585 .",
    "we define a nave concept of height on the set of genus @xmath36 curves over @xmath488 so that we can define the proportion we are interested in as a limit",
    ".        it would be perhaps more natural to order the curves by @xmath591 rather than maximal absolute value of the coefficients .",
    "our motivation for partitioning the set of genus @xmath36 curves by @xmath586 is that one can easily sample uniformly from @xmath586 , whereas this is much more complicated otherwise .",
    "a related question has a definite answer . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that there is a well - defined proportion of genus @xmath36 curves over @xmath488 that have points everywhere locally .",
    "in fact , if one actually computes the local densities involved , one arrives at @xmath592 on the other hand , one would expect that the proportion of curves that actually have a rational point vanishes as @xmath21 grows : @xmath593 heuristic considerations suggest that the quantity under the limit should be of order @xmath594 .",
    "we are interested in the question whether the following limit exists and what might be its value : @xmath595 to this end , we tested if @xmath482 for a fairly large number of curves , sampled from @xmath586 for various @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath596 we considered all of @xmath586 ( see @xcite ) and our results are unconditional for all but 42 of the roughly 200000 isomorphism classes of curves involved . in the table below , these curves are counted according to isomorphism class .",
    "* whether the curve has a small rational point ( whose @xmath45-coordinate is a rational number with numerator and denominator bounded by @xmath599 in absolute value ) , * whether the curve is everywhere locally solvable , * whether @xmath482 , where for reasons of efficiency , the class group information needed to compute @xmath450 was only verified subject to the generalized riemann hypothesis .",
    "see table  [ tbl : data ] for the statistics and figure  [ fig : graph ] for a graph of the data . it should be noted that the samples for the various  @xmath21 are not completely independent : any curve sampled from @xmath586 that happened to have all its coefficients bounded by @xmath601 was also included as sample from @xmath602 .      1",
    ".   the proportion of curves with a local obstruction against rational points tends to a value near @xmath534% remarkably quickly .",
    "2 .   as @xmath21 increases , the proportion of curves in @xmath586 with a small rational point decreases in the expected way .",
    "the jumps that can be observed at @xmath603 come from additional possibilities for points at infinity or with @xmath245 that occur when the leading or trailing coefficient is a square .",
    "the proportion of curves with @xmath490 non - empty decreases more slowly .",
    "figure  [ fig : graph ] clearly shows that , at least for @xmath604 , testing if @xmath482 is a very useful criterion to decide if @xmath471 is empty , with less than 15% of undecided curves .",
    "the data is inconclusive on a possible limit value for the proportion of curves @xmath605 with @xmath482 as @xmath606 , but it suggests that it might be somewhere between 65% and  85% .",
    "it would be very interesting to find out if this limit exists and what its approximate value might be .",
    "what makes this likely to be hard is the subtle interplay between local and global information that determines the size of  @xmath490 ."
