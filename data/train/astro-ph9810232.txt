    "the resonance doublet of li  i at @xmath06708 is an important diagnostic of age in late - type stars since it is easy destroyed by thermonuclear reactions in the stellar interiors . however , li  i observations of several types of chromospherically active stars , such as pre - main sequence stars , late - type dwarfs in open clusters , as well as post - main sequence objects , show a significant range of abundances .",
    "it is well - known that a large number of chromospherically active binaries ( cab hereafter ) show li  i abundances higher than the normal values characteristic of stars of the same mass and evolutionary stage ( pallavicini et al .",

    "this line is very temperature sensitive because of its low ionization potential of 5.37  ev .",
    "thus the equivalent width ( ew ) should be enhanced in dark spots but reduced in the bright facular regions as demonstrated by solar observations ( giampapa 1984 ) . a number of researchers ( fekel 1996 ; barrado 1996 ; hussain et al .",
    "1997 ; fernndez & miranda 1998 ; neuhuser et al .",
    "1998 ) have investigated starspots as the possible cause of the observed li  i abundances spreads .",
    "however , li can also be produced by low energy spallation reactions in stellar flares ( fowler et al .",
    "1955 ; canal 1974 ; canal et al .",
    "some evidence of li production by spallation have been found in the sun ( livshits 1997 ; livingston et al .",
    "1997 ) , but no detection has been reported in other stars .",
    "spallation has only been discussed as a possibility to explain the high li abundances observed in some stars ( pallavicini et al . 1992 ; mathioudakis et al . 1995 ; favata et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this letter",
    "we describe the li  i @xmath06708 line enhancement detected during the observations of an unusual long - duration optical flare in the recently discovered , x - ray / euv selected cab 2re  j0743 + 224 , and discuss the possible causes .",
    "high resolution ( 0.16   ) observations of this star were obtained during a 10 night run 1998 january 12 - 21 using the 2.1 m telescope at mcdonald observatory and the sandiford cassegrain echelle spectrograph ( mccarthy et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the spectra in the li  i line region are plotted in fig .  [ fig : rej0743_li ] .",
    "these observations are analyzed in detail in a separate paper ( montes & ramsey 1998b ) where stellar properties , orbital parameters , and chromospheric behavior are discussed .",
    "we found that this star , previously classified as single - lined spectroscopic binary ( jeffries et al .",
    "1995 ) , is a double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) with a k1  iii primary and an orbital period of 10 days .",
    "a dramatic increase in the chromospheric emissions ( h@xmath3 and ca  ii irt lines ) is detected during the observations ( see the temporal evolution of the h@xmath3 ew in the upper left panel of fig.[fig : li_ews ] ) .",
    "the increase of the emission start the 3th night ( 1998 january 15 ) reach a maximum on the 5th night and at the end of the observations ( 1998 january 22 ) the chromospheric lines had not yet recovered the quiescent value .",
    "the total duration of the event was evidently larger than 8 days .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as an unusual long - duration flare based on a ) the temporal evolution of the event , b ) the broad component observed in the h@xmath3 line profile , c ) the detection of the he  i d@xmath4 line in emission and d ) a filled - in of the he  i @xmath06678    line .",
    "a detailed description of the flare is given in montes & ramsey ( 1998a , b ) .",
    "here we analyze the spectra in the li  i @xmath06708     line region .",
    "the li  i absorption feature is clearly observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rej0743_li ] ) and appears centered at the wavelength corresponding to the primary component with no evidence for a contribution from the secondary . the mean ew is 130  m  which is a little bit above the normal value for this kind of star , typically @xmath5 100  m , ( randich et al .",
    "1994 ; barrado et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , a small absorption feature corresponding to the li  i @xmath06104     is marginally detected in the spectrum taken the 4th night .",
    "a careful analysis of the li  i @xmath06708",
    "  line indicates that the line profile , ew , and intensity , i , are changing during the observations .",
    "the measured ew and i are given in table  [ tab : li ] and the ew is plotted in fig  [ fig : li_ews ] , where we can see that the increase of li  i line follows the temporal evolution of the flare .",
    "the maximum li  i enhancement ( 50% in ew ) occurs just after the maximum chromospheric emission observed in the flare ( 5th night ) .",
    "however , any real variations of the li  i ew ( in excess of the uncertainties ) are clearly indicated on nights 1 and 7 only .    in order to test",
    "if these variations are real we have also measured the ew of other photospheric lines .",
    "we have selected several isolated lines in the same spectral order as the li  i line ; fe  i @xmath06710.3     and fe  i @xmath06703.6     which are close and similar in strength to the li  i line .",
    "in addition we study the more intense lines fe  i @xmath06663.4    and ca  i @xmath06717.7   .",
    "other intense lines included in different spectral orders were also measured .",
    "all are neutral lines and , as the li  i line , the ew should be enhanced in a different way depending of their excitational potential when the the temperature decrease .",
    "these lines are listed in table  [ tab : linesp ] together with their excitational potential ( @xmath6 ) and the mean ew ( @xmath7 ) , the standard deviation ( @xmath8 ) , and the peak to peak variation ( ew@xmath9 - ew@xmath10 ) . the measured ew for each night is plotted in fig  [ fig : li_ews ] , the errors bars have been calculated taking into account the error in placing of the continuum and the @xmath8 obtained from repeated measures in each line .",
    "as can be seen the variations in these lines are very small and , contrary to the li  i line no correlation with the temporal evolution of the flare is evident .",
    "the peak to peak variation in the li  i line is a factor 3 larger than in the other lines and the @xmath8 of similar strength lines is 3 times smaller .",
    "furthermore , no clear systematic behavior is observed with different excitation potentials .",
    "one source of variability of the li  i @xmath06708    line could due to blending with tio bands at 6707.29 , 6707.92 , and 6708.16   and cn bands at 6707.64 as these molecular bands also become stronger at the lower temperatures of the starspots . however , the calculations of the li  i abundance in sunspots that take into account these bands ( engvold et al . 1970 ; ritzenhoff et al .",
    "1997 ) concluded that the molecular blend is of lower importance .",
    "thus it seems reasonable assume that this effect in the stellar spectra is also negligible . at this spectral resolution",
    "the li  i line is blended with the nearby fe  i @xmath06707.41    line , which is clearly seen in the spectra of the inactive and li free star hr 5340 ( k1  iii ) . the mean ew measured in these spectra is 20  m , which is much smaller than the observed li  i ew .",
    "furthermore , as the other photospheric lines we measured did not show significant variations , we conclude that this line does not produce the variation in the measured li  i ew . due to the sb2 nature of this binary in some orbital phases the lines of the primary component",
    "could be blended with the lines from the secondary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rej0743_li ] ) .",
    "this is clearly seen in the spectrum from the 5th night ( which is very close the conjunction ) .",
    "the ew of the strongest lines measured during this night are noticeably larger than in the rest of the nights due to the contribution ( @xmath11  15% ) to the ew from the secondary .",
    "we have corrected the ew for this effect by subtracting the ew of the lines in the secondary measured at other orbital phases where the lines are not blended .",
    "these corrected values are what we have plotted in fig  [ fig : li_ews ] .",
    "however , for weak lines with ew similar to the li  i line the contribution of the secondary seems to be negligible and this effect is not observed . in conclusion the observed li  i line variations do not seem to be due to any kind of line blends .",
    "the li  i line variations could be caused by possible cold spots and faculae on the stellar surface ( see review by fekel 1996 ) . since",
    "this line is very temperature sensitive , the ew should be enhanced in dark spots but reduced in the bright facular regions as shown by solar observations ( grevesse 1968 ; traub & roesler 1971 ; giampapa 1984 ) .",
    "while giampapa ( 1984 ) suggests this can substantially alter the ew in stellar spectra , other authors find this is not the case .",
    "no detection of li  i ew variations in six active dwarfs have been reported by boesgaard ( 1991 ) .",
    "the calculations of soderblom et al .",
    "( 1993 ) indicate that the effect is only significant when the fraction of the surface covered by spots is very high ( see also stuik et al .",
    "pallavicini et al .",
    "( 1993 ) show by means of spectral synthesis simulations that the effects may be less pronounced than suggested by giampapa ( 1984 ) and found no evidence that changes in the ew is correlated with the photometric variability due to starspots in four active stars .",
    "the simulations done by barrado ( 1996 ) also indicated smaller changes in the ew and even , in certain cases , the presence of faculae can cancel these changes , leaving the ew unaltered . by application of the doppler imaging technique , hussain et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that the li  i behaves in much the same way that conventional doppler imaging ca  i and fe  i lines do .",
    "until now significant variations in the li  i ew have been found only in some stars with very high li  i abundances such as pre - main sequence stars ( patterer et al .",
    "1993 ; fernndez & miranda 1998 ; neuhuser et al . 1998 ) and other young and very active stars ( robinson et al . 1986 ; jeffries et al . 1994 ; soderblom et al . 1996 ) .",
    "large li  i ew variation has been observed at larger v band amplitude in v410 tau . here",
    "a peak to peak variability the li  i ew of 0.12     has been found by fernndez & miranda ( 1998 ) when the amplitude in v was 0.6  mag , while little or no variation have been reported by previous work on this star at lower v amplitudes ( basri et al .",
    "1991 ; patterer et al .",
    "1993 ; martn 1993 ; welty & ramsey 1995 ) .",
    "this result is confirmed on the young star par  1724 by neuhuser et al .",
    "however , in cab little or no variations have been previously reported ( pallavicini et al . 1993 ) .",
    "recent observations ( berdyugina et al . 1998 ) of the extremely cab ii peg , which exhibits high v band variations and spot filling factors , show very small li  i ew variations ( 10  m ) , poorly correlated with quasi - simultaneous photometric observations .",
    "the li  i ew variations that we observe are clearly larger than those reported in other cab with similar activity levels and li  i abundance .",
    "indeed , in other stars that exhibit large li  i ew variations other photospheric lines exhibit similar ew variations ( fernndez & miranda 1998 ) , contrary to the behavior we report here .",
    "taking into account all these facts , the starspots that we infer on the surface of 2re  j0743 + 224 from the analysis of the tio 7055    band ( montes & ramsey 1998b ) , do not seem to be the primary cause of the observed li  i line variation .",

    "gf_-value , pure @xmath2li would produce a cog wavelength of 6707.8117   while pure @xmath1li would be 6707.9713   . for weak lines , intermediate mixtures would yield a wavelength , @xmath13 , between the two isotopes that would be weighted by the @xmath1li/@xmath2li ratio as @xmath1li/@xmath2li = ( @xmath13 - 6707.8117 ) / ( 6707.9713 - @xmath13 ) . to determine the value of @xmath13 we have measured the difference between the li  i and ca  i features ( @xmath12 = ca  i - li  i ) where we adopt a wavelength of 6717.681    for the ca  i line .",
    "we give these values and the corresponding @xmath1li/@xmath2li ratio obtained in table  [ tab : li ] .",
    "the largest difference in the inferred li  i ) wavelengths amounts to only 0.046  , or 30% of one resolution element , and the effects of the blended fe  i , cn , and tio lines on these inferred , apparent wavelengths of the li  i line are uncertain . in order to estimate the possible errors we have also measured this difference , @xmath12 , for other photospheric lines included in the same spectral order than the li  i feature .",

    "this significant change in @xmath12 and thus in the @xmath1li/@xmath2li ratio is consistent with increasing @xmath1li during the flare as is predicted for the production of li  i by spallation reactions .",
    "the li  i ew variations that we observe are clearly correlated with the temporal evolution of the flare , and large changes are observed in the core of the li  i line , as predict the models of li production in flares ( livshits 1997 ) .",
    "thus taking into account that the other possible causes of variability have been minimized above we suggest that this li  i is produced by spallation reactions in the flare .",
