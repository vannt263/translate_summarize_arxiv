    "microtubules are filamentous protein aggregates that appear in all eukaryotic cells .",
    "they have an inherent polarity that results in different dynamics at their two ends .",
    "the so - called plus end is highly dynamic , alternating between prolonged periods of polymerization ( growth ) and depolymerization ( shrinkage ) @xcite . on the other end of the filament ,",
    "the minus end often remains connected to the locus of nucleation @xcite or is found to exhibit relatively steady depolymerization @xcite .",
    "the combination of slow depolymerization at the minus end and prolonged growth at the plus end leads to a phenomenon known as treadmilling , whereby the individual tubulin dimers appear to move from the plus to the minus end @xcite . as the stiffest of the cytoskeletal filaments , microtubules",
    "are widely used in intracellular transport and for structural support .",
    "therefore , the dynamic properties of the microtubules are tightly regulated by the cell , often through the use of microtubule - associated proteins ( maps ) @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate one particular type of map that causes the severing of microtubules .",
    "it was noted by vale @xcite that otherwise stable microtubules could be severed in mitotic extracts of xenopus eggs .",
    "this activity was traced back to a protein that is able to use atp hydrolysis to sever microtubules .",
    "the protein was identified only later and given the name katanin after the katana , the japanese samurai sword @xcite .",
    "katanin is a heterodimer , consisting of the p60 and p80 subunits : the p80 subunit is thought to be responsible for the targeting of the protein , whereas p60 is involved in the actual severing as part of a hexameric ring @xcite .",
    "the hexameric form of katanin appears to remove individual dimers from the microtubule lattice , thereby compromising the structural integrity of the microtubule .",
    "it is not currently clear whether katanin acts uniformly along the microtubule , or whether it is attracted by pre - existing lattice defects @xcite .",
    "katanin homologs have since been discovered across the animal and plant kingdoms @xcite . another severing protein by the name of spastin has also been identified . like katanin",
    ", it also assembles in a hexameric ring , suggesting a severing mechanism similar to that of katanin @xcite .",
    "both katanin and spastin are capable of severing microtubules at seemingly random locations , and are used by the cell for the regulation of the cytoskeleton @xcite , for example in the mitotic and meiotic spindles @xcite or the formation of the transverse cortical array in plant cells @xcite .",
    "generally , the activity of severing proteins leads to a decrease in the average microtubule length , but an increase in their number @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this increase in number can sometimes more than offset the loss of microtubule length due to the average length decrease @xcite .",
    "in this work , we investigate theoretically how the occurrence of microtubule severing at random positions affects the length distribution of microtubules .",
    "previous studies have assessed the effect of severing on actin filaments @xcite . however , whereas actin has a single growth mode that is described well by constant polymerization and depolymerization rates , microtubules show richer dynamics because the plus end switches between growing ( polymerizing ) and shrinking ( depolymerizing ) states .",
    "we base our model on the basic dynamic instability model that was introduced by dogterom and leibler @xcite . in this model , microtubules exist in either the growing or the shrinking state , and switch between these states with a ` catastrophe ' rate @xmath0 ( growth @xmath1 shrinkage ) and a ` rescue ' rate @xmath2 ( shrinkage @xmath1 growth ) . in the growing state , the microtubule extends with an effective speed @xmath3 , and in the shrinking state it retreats with an effective speed @xmath4 .",
    "new microtubules are nucleated with a steady nucleation rate @xmath5 .",
    "this set of constraints gives rise to a steady state distribution of microtubule lengths , provided that @xmath6 .",
    "we model microtubule severing by a constant severing rate per unit length .",
    "this is a valid approximation if we assume that microtubule severing process occurs on a time scale that is much shorter than the time in which a microtubule grows significantly . by taking a constant severing rate",
    ", we also implicitly assume that severing is limited by the availability of microtubules , i.e. the severing protein is available in abundance .",
    "however , because we focus on steady - state results , where the total amount of microtubules is constant , the possible invalidity of this assumption will not qualitatively affect the results .",
    "following the approach in @xcite , we construct a set of evolution equations for the length distributions of growing and shrinking microtubules . denoting the growing and shrinking microtubule length distributions by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively",
    ", the equations can be written as    [ eq : seveqnall ] @xmath9    where the derivatives with respect to @xmath10 reflect the translation of the distributions due to growth and shrinkage of microtubules . the severing contribution @xmath11",
    "will be constructed below .",
    "these equations are supplemented by the boundary condition @xmath12 specifying the nucleation of new microtubules with rate @xmath5 , and by the physically motivated constraint that both distributions tend to zero for large lengths ( there are no infinitely long microtubules ) .",

    "the inclusion of severing events leads to two types of contributions to the evolution of the length distributions : the _ disappearance _ flux @xmath22 of microtubules of a certain length @xmath10 and the _ appearance _ fluxes @xmath23 and @xmath24 of two new microtubules with a total length @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the newly created microtubules can be created from microtubules that were initially growing ( + ) or shrinking ( - ) .",
    "symbolically , we write @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for the removal of microtubules in state @xmath28 , and @xmath29 represents the appearance of new microtubules of length @xmath10 in state @xmath30 as a result of the severing of microtubules in state @xmath31 . the contributions will be discussed individually below .",
    "the process of severing is controlled by the severing rate @xmath32 that is given as a rate per unit of length .",
    "thus we find that the fluxes of disappearing microtubules @xmath33 ( growing ) and @xmath34 ( shrinking ) are given by @xmath35    in order to specify the influx terms @xmath36 it is necessary to specify the process of severing in more detail .",
    "we will assume that the action of the severing protein is local , thus having no effect on the remote plus and minus ends of the microtubule it severs .",
    "this implies that the plus end fragment of a severed microtubule remains in the same state .",
    "however , we must make an explicit assumption regarding the state of the newly created plus end . in line with biological observations @xcite",
    ", we assume that this plus end always starts out in the shrinking state . a severing event thus shortens an existing microtubule without affecting its growth state and creates an additional microtubule that is in the shrinking state . if necessary",
    ", the model can easily be extended to handle ( a fraction of ) severing - created plus ends that start out in the growing state .",

    "note that we do not need to keep track of the correlations between the lengths of the _ individual _ microtubules that are created from a single cutting event , because we are looking only at ensemble - averaged length distributions .",
    "the contributions derived above are similar in form to those introduced by edelstein - keshet and ermentrout @xcite as the continuous limit of a discrete monomer addition and severing model for actin filaments .",
    "however , we use distinct asymmetric terms for growing and shrinking microtubules .",
    "the model as described does not explicitly take into account the often observed depolymerization of microtubules at their minus ends that leads to treadmilling .",
    "however , this case is easily addressed through a renormalization of the growth and shrinkage speeds . denoting the shrinkage speed at the minus end by @xmath47 ,",
    "this is achieved by the substitutions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , leaving the results qualitatively unchanged by the incorporation of treadmilling .",

    "we have analyzed the steady state solutions and their properties : notably the number of microtubules and their average length .",
    "for the special cases of no rescue events ( @xmath71 ) and small severing rates ( see appendix [ sec : smallsev ] ) , we have presented analytical solutions .",
    "the general case has been addressed by transforming the coupled integro - differential equations into a single fourth order differential equation that is solved numerically .",
    "the resulting microtubule length distributions show a number of interesting properties .",
    "as expected , an increase in the severing rate always leads to a decrease in the average length of the microtubules .",
    "in addition , because the rate of severing is proportional to the microtubule length , the number of very long microtubules is strongly reduced , leading to a distribution that is more compact ( see appendix [ sec : smallsev ] for an explicit expression ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the dynamic instability model without severing , the length distributions are no longer guaranteed to decrease monotonically with increasing length .",
    "for some parameters , a ` bump ' is observed in the length distribution , caused by the continuous creation of short ( but not vanishingly small ) microtubules through the severing process .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the total number of microtubules does not depend on the severing rate , even though the average length of each microtubule decreases . to understand this counterintuitive result",
    ", we consider a system without severing , in which the following steady - state relation holds : [ population size ] @xmath125 [ nucleation rate ] @xmath126 [ average lifetime ] .",
    "suppose that a single microtubule is severed ( consistent with an infinitesimally small severing rate ) .",
    "the expected lifetime of the created segments is obviously shorter than that of the original segment .",
    "however , the fact that the total number of microtubules is unaffected by the presence of severing implies that this decrease in lifetime is compensated _ exactly _ by the fact that every severing event ` nucleates ' an extra microtubule . for this cancellation to occur",
    ", the sum of the lifetimes of the two fragments of a severed microtubule should equal the expected lifetime of the microtubule if severing had not occurred .",
    "that this is indeed the case can be shown using a simple argument , based on the lifetime of a microtubule in the absence of severing . in this case",
    "the dynamics of the microtubule tip are independent of its length .",
    "this implies that the average time it takes for a growing microtubule of length @xmath10 to later return ( in a shrinking state ) to the _ same _ length is independent of the value of @xmath10 , and therefore equal to the average microtubule lifetime @xmath127 ( obtained by starting from @xmath128 ) . the remaining contribution to the lifetime",
    "is given by the time it takes for the shrinking microtubule of length @xmath10 to disappear . in the absence of rescue events , this would take a time @xmath129 . however , each rescue event switches the microtubule back to the growing state , extending the microtubule s expected lifetime by @xmath127 before it returns to the same position in the shrinking state .",
    "the expected number of such rescue events is equal to @xmath130 .",
    "this argument is illustrated in figure [ fig : shrinkdynamics ] .",
    "collecting the terms described above , we obtain the following expression for the expected microtubule lifetime @xmath131 of a microtubule of length @xmath10 and growth state @xmath28 : @xmath132 the same relation , including an expression for @xmath127 , has been derived analytically by and bicout @xcite and an equivalent expression for microtubules that grow in discrete units was produced by rubin @xcite .    each severing event conserves the total length @xmath10 of the severed microtubule and the state @xmath30 of the existing plus end , and the newly created plus end immediately undergoes a catastrophe ( @xmath133 ) . in terms of life times",
    "we find that @xmath134 , so that a single severing event indeed preserves the total lifetime . by induction",
    "it follows that _ any _ number of severing events will leave the expected number of microtubules in the system intact .    .",
    "the return times @xmath135 have an expectation value @xmath127 . ]",
    "we stress that this argument holds regardless of the frequency and location of severing events .",
    "this implies that any distribution of severing events  provided they lead to a catastrophe of the trailing end ",
    "conserves the total number of microtubules in steady state .",
    "specifically , this also applies to severing at positions where microtubules of different orientations cross @xcite , a process that may be relevant to the formation of the cortical array in plant cells .",
    "the conservation of microtubule number in the presence of severing is in apparent contradiction with the experimentally reported increase in microtubule numbers @xcite .",
    "however , this can be readily explained by the fact that our results are based on the assumption of constant parameter values . in a living cell ,",
    "the decrease in average microtubule length that is the result of severing will lead to an increased availability of free tubulin dimers . in turn , this is likely to increase the polymerization rate ( growth speed ) and nucleation rate , which would indeed cause an increase in the number of microtubules .",
