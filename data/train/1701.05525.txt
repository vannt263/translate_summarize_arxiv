    "a graph @xmath0 is a _ partial cube _ if it is ( isomorphic to ) an isometric subgraph of a hypercube graph @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 for all @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the distance function of the respective graphs .",
    "partial cubes were introduced by graham and pollak  @xcite in the study of interconnection networks .",
    "they form an important graph class in media theory  @xcite , frequently appear in chemical graph theory  @xcite , and quoting  @xcite present one of the central and most studied classes in metric graph theory .",
    "important subclasses of partial cubes include median graphs , bipartite cellular graphs , hypercellular graphs , pasch graphs , and netlike partial cubes .",
    "partial cubes also capture several important graph classes not directly coming from metric graph theory , such as region graphs of hyperplane arrangements , diagrams of distributive lattices , linear extension graphs of posets , tope graphs of oriented matroids ( oms ) , tope graphs of affine oriented matroids ( aoms ) , and lopsided systems ( lops ) .",
    "a recently introduced unifying generalization of these classes are complexes of oriented matroids ( coms ) , whose tope graphs are partial cubes as well  @xcite .",
    "partial cubes admit a natural minor - relation ( pc - minors for short ) and several of the above classes including tope graphs of coms are pc - minor closed .",
    "complete ( finite ) lists of excluded pc - minors are known for median graphs , bipartite cellular graphs , hypercellular graphs and pasch graphs , see  @xcite .",
    "another well - known construction of a smaller graph from a partial cube is the zone graph  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on coms and their tope graphs .",
    "we present two characterizations of the tope graphs and thus two graph theoretical characterizations of coms .",
    "the first characterization is in terms of its complete ( infinite ) list of excluded pc - minors . as corollaries",
    "we obtain excluded pc - minor characterizations for tope graphs of oms , aoms , and lops .",
    "moreover , in the case of bounded rank the list of excluded pc - minors is finite .",
    "we devise a polynomial time algorithm for checking if a given partial cube has another one as pc - minor , leading to polynomial time recognition algorithms for the classes with a finite list of excluded pc - minors .",
    "another consequence is a characterization of tope graphs of coms in terms of iterated zone graphs , which generalizes a result of handa  @xcite about tope sets of oms .",
    "the second characterization of tope graphs of coms is in terms of the metric behavior of certain subgraphs .",
    "more precisely , we prove that a partial cube is the tope graph of a com if and only if all of its antipodal ( also known as symmetric - even  @xcite ) subgraphs are gated . as corollaries , this theorem specializes to tope graphs of oms , aoms , and lops .",
    "in particular , we obtain a new unified proof for characterization theorems of tope sets of lops and oms due to lawrence  @xcite and da silva  @xcite , respectively .",
    "moreover , this characterization allows to prove that pasch graphs are coms , confirming a conjecture of chepoi , knauer , and marc  @xcite . finally , our characterization is verifiable in polynomial time , hence gives polynomial time recognition algorithms for tope graphs of coms , oms , aoms , and lops , even without bounding the rank .    in particular , we answer two related open questions on oms , i.e. , the question for a graph theoretical characterization and for polynomial time recognition , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "* structure of the paper : *    in section  [ sec : pcminors ] we introduce partial cubes with some more care , as well as metric subgraphs such as convex , gated , antipodal , and affine subgraphs and we discuss their behavior with respect to pc - minors and expansions .",
    "moreover , we discuss zone graphs of partial cubes , which plays a role in part of our proof .",
    "also , we devise a polynomial time algorithm for checking if a given partial cube has another one as a pc - minor ( proposition  [ prop : polyminor ] ) .",
    "we give an expansion procedure of how to construct all antipodal partial cubes from a single vertex ( lemma  [ lem : antipodalexpansion ] ) and provide an intrinsic characterization of affine partial cubes ( proposition  [ prop : affinepc ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : signvectors ] is dedicated to the introduction of the systems of sign - vectors relevant to this paper , i.e.  coms , oms , aoms , and lops , and their behavior under the usual minor - relations .    in section  [ sec : alltogethernow ] we bring the content of the first two sections together and explain how systems of sign - vectors lead to partial cubes and vice versa .",
    "we show how metric properties of subgraphs and pc - minors correspond to axiomatic properties and minor relations of systems of sign - vectors .",
    "in particular we prove that in tope graphs of coms all antipodal subgraphs are gated ( theorem  [ thm : dictionaryomc ] ) , and characterize tope graphs of oms , aoms , and lops as special tope graphs of coms .",
    "theorem  [ thm : dictionaryomc ] gives the first implication for our characterization theorem .    in section",
    "[ sec : forbidden ] we introduce the ( infinite ) class of excluded pc - minors of tope graphs of coms and provide some of its crucial properties , that will be used throughout the proofs in the following sections .",
    "in particular , we show that every member of the class has an antipodal subgraph that is not gated ( lemma  [ lem : minfamily ] ) .",
    "we conclude section  [ sec : forbidden ] with the the proof that partial cubes excluding all pc - minors from the class are tope graphs of coms ( theorem  [ thm : topegraphs ] ) .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ thm : topegraphs ] gives the second implication of our characterization .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : antipodalminorclosed ] we show that the class of partial cubes in which all antipodal subgraphs are gated is closed under pc - minors ( theorem  [ thm : agminors ] ) . since the members of our class of excluded pc - minors have non - gated antipodal subgraphs , this yields the third and last implication of our characterization .",
    "section  [ sec : corollaries ] is dedicated to the corollaries of our theorem , that are announced above .",
    "in , particular we prove the generalization of handa s theorem ( corollary  [ cor : handa ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper with several further questions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us give an alternative way of characterizing partial cubes .",
    "any isometric embedding of a partial cube into a hypercube leads to the same partition of edges into so - called @xmath5-classes , where two edges are equivalent , if they correspond to a change in the same coordinate of the hypercube .",
    "this can be shown using the djokovi - winkler - relation @xmath5 which is defined in the graph without reference to an embedding , see  @xcite .",
    "we will describe next , how the relation @xmath5 can be defined independently of an embedding .",
    "a subgraph @xmath6 of @xmath7 is _ convex _ if for all pairs of vertices in @xmath6 all their shortest paths in @xmath7 indeed stay in @xmath6 . for an edge @xmath8 of @xmath7 ,",
    "define the sets @xmath9 and @xmath10 . by a theorem of djokovi  @xcite ,",
    "a graph @xmath7 is a partial cube if and only if @xmath7 is bipartite and for any edge @xmath8 the sets @xmath11 and @xmath12 are convex . in this case , setting @xmath13 for @xmath8 and @xmath14 if @xmath15 and @xmath16 yields @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the set of equivalence classes of @xmath5 .",
    "for an equivalence class @xmath18 and an arbitrary edge @xmath19 , let @xmath20 and @xmath21 the pair of complementary convex halfspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "now , identifying any vertex @xmath22 of @xmath7 with @xmath23 which for any class of @xmath5 associates the sign of the halfspace containing @xmath22 gives an isometric embedding of @xmath7 into @xmath24 .",
    "given @xmath25 , an _",
    "( elementary ) restriction _ consists in taking one of the subgraphs @xmath26 or @xmath27 induced by the complementary halfspaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which we will denote by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these graphs are isometric subgraphs of the hypercube @xmath32 . now applying two elementary restriction with respect to different coordinates @xmath33 , independently of the order of @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we will obtain one of the four ( possibly empty ) subgraphs induced by @xmath36 and @xmath37 . since the intersection of convex subsets is convex , each of these four sets is convex in @xmath7 and",
    "consequently induces an isometric subgraph of the hypercube @xmath38 .",
    "more generally , a _ restriction _ is a subgraph of @xmath7 induced by the intersection of a set of ( non - complementary ) halfspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "we denote a restriction by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a signed set of halfspaces of @xmath7 . for subset @xmath41 of the vertices of @xmath7 and @xmath25 ,",
    "we denote @xmath42 .",
    "the smallest convex subgraph of @xmath7 containing @xmath43 is called the _ convex hull _ of @xmath43 and denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "the following is well - known :    [ lem : restriction ] the set of restrictions of a partial cube @xmath7 coincides with its set of convex subgraphs .",
    "indeed , for any subset of vertices @xmath43 we have that @xmath44 is the intersection of all halfspaces containing @xmath43 . in particular ,",
    "the class of partial cubes is closed under taking restrictions .    for @xmath25",
    ", we say that the graph @xmath45 obtained from @xmath7 by contracting the edges of the equivalence class @xmath46 is an _",
    "( elementary ) contraction _ of @xmath7 . for a vertex @xmath22 of @xmath7",
    ", we will denote by @xmath47 the image of @xmath22 under the contraction in @xmath45 , i.e.  if @xmath48 is an edge of @xmath46 , then @xmath49 , otherwise @xmath50 .",
    "we will apply @xmath51 to subsets @xmath52 , by setting @xmath53 .",
    "in particular we denote the _ contraction _ of @xmath7 by @xmath54 .",
    "it is well - known and in particular follows from the proof of the first part of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) that @xmath54 is an isometric subgraph of @xmath32 .",
    "since edge contractions in graphs commute , i.e.  the resulting graph does not depend on the order in which a set of edges is contracted , we have :    [ lem : commut_contraction ] the class of partial cubes is closed under contractions . moreover , contractions commute in partial cubes , i.e.  if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , for a set @xmath58 , we denote by @xmath59 the isometric subgraph of @xmath60 obtained from @xmath7 by contracting the classes @xmath58 in @xmath7 .",
    "the following can easily be derived from the definitions , see e.g.  @xcite :    [ lem : commut_rest_contaction ] contractions and restrictions commute in partial cubes , i.e.  if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then @xmath61 .",
    "the previous lemmas show that any set of restrictions and any set of contractions of a partial cube @xmath7 provide the same result , independently of the order in which we perform the restrictions and contractions .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath6 is also a partial cube , and @xmath6 is called a",
    "_ pc - minor _ of @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we will study classes of partial cubes that are closed under taking pc - minors .",
    "clearly , any such class has a ( possibly infinite ) set @xmath62 of minimal excluded pc - minors .",
    "we denote by @xmath63 the pc - minor closed class of partial cubes excluding @xmath64 .",
    "[ prop : polyminor ] let @xmath64 be a finite set of partial cubes .",
    "it is decidable in polynomial time if a partial cube @xmath7 is in @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath65 be partial cubes .",
    "denote by @xmath66 and @xmath67 the number of vertices of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the number of @xmath5-classes in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that testing if @xmath6 is a pc - minor of @xmath7 can be done in polynomial time with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "this clearly implies the result .    for every subset @xmath43 of at most @xmath66 vertices of @xmath7 do the following :",
    "first compute @xmath44 and count the number of @xmath5-classes of @xmath7 crossing it , say it equals to @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71 , and if @xmath72 discard the subgraph . on the other hand , if @xmath73 , then for every subset @xmath41 of size @xmath74 of the @xmath5-classes crossing @xmath44 , contract in @xmath44 all the @xmath5-classes of @xmath41 .",
    "finally , check if the resulting graph is isomorphic to @xmath6 .    using lemma  [ lem : commut_rest_contaction ] , we know that @xmath6 is a pc - minor if and only if it can be obtained by first restricting and then contracting , and by lemma  [ lem : restriction ] , taking restrictions coincides with taking convex hulls .",
    "this gives the correctness of the algorithm .",
    "for the running time , we have a loop of length @xmath75 . in each execution",
    "we compute @xmath44 which via lemma  [ lem : restriction ] can be easily done by intersecting all the halfspaces containing @xmath43 .",
    "then we have @xmath76 choices for the contractions of the @xmath5-classes , each of which can clearly be done in polynomial time , too .",
    "note that @xmath77 . finally , we check if the obtained graph is isomorphic to @xmath78 , which only depends on @xmath66 .    later on we will also consider the inverse operation of contraction : a partial cube @xmath7 is an _ expansion _ of a partial cube @xmath6 if @xmath79 for some @xmath5-class @xmath34 of @xmath7 .",
    "indeed expansions can be detected within the smaller graph .",
    "let @xmath6 be a partial cube containing two isometric subgraphs @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , there are no edges from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , and denote @xmath85 .",

    "using proposition  [ prop : affinepc ] it is easy to see , that the affine partial cubes in @xmath465 are exactly the graphs of the form @xmath803 .",

    "moreover , the antipodal subgraphs obtained as in the proof of proposition  [ prop : affinepc ] from the affine graphs @xmath803 give a family of excluded contraction minors for @xmath423 .",

    "however , also this family is incomplete , since the graph @xmath800 constructed above has no halfspace in @xmath465 .",
    "several characterizations of planar partial cubes are known  @xcite , where the latter corrects a characterization from  @xcite .",
    "a particular consequence of corollary  [ cor : boundedrank ] is that tope graphs of oms of rank at most three are characterized by the finite list of excluded pc - minors @xmath806 . by a result of fukuda and handa  @xcite this graph class coincides with the class of antipodal planar partial cubes .",
    "since planar partial cubes are closed under pc - minors , we wonder about an extension of this result to general planar partial cubes :      it is easy to see , that any answer here will be an infinite list , since a ( strict ) subfamily is given by the set @xmath807 , where @xmath808 denotes the _ gear graph _ ( also known as _ cogwheel _ ) on @xmath809 vertices .",
    "this in particular shows , that if a pc - minor closed class is contained in an ( ordinary ) minor closed graph class it can still have an infinite list of excluded minors .",
    "a tempting probably quite hard problem is the following :        we wish to thank emanuele delucchi and yida zhu for discussions on aoms , ilda da silva for insights on oms , hans - jrgen bandelt and victor chepoi for several discussions on coms , and matja kove for being part of the first sessions on tope graphs ."
