    "currently , the origin of the nuclear radio emission from radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , which consists of 90@xmath1 of the optically detected quasars @xcite , is not understood .",
    "the luminosity of the nuclear radio emission and its compactness is similar to the nuclear radio luminosity , brightness temperature and compactness of radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "likewise the variability @xcite is similar between both classes . for radio - loud quasar",
    "the nuclear radio emission is explained by the superposition of different jet - components @xcite . however , radio - quiet quasars lack radio emission on large scales which are indicative of expanding lobes fed by jets .",
    "a possibility is that radio - quiet quasars do have much weaker jets , which do not escape the inner 1  kpc of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "however most rqqs studied with vbli show unresolved radio emission , even at mas scales , indicating an emission volume of a few pc@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the suggestion that the radio emission from nuclei in rqq is due to a superposition of jet knots , seems unrealistic for those rqq where there is no evidence for a jet .",
    "recently , two alternative models explaining the radio emission in rqqs have been proposed .",
    "@xcite proposed that radio emission in radio - quiet quasars originates in a optically thin plasma with a temperature of order 10@xmath3  k , such that the plasma is completely ionised .",
    "this plasma has a density high enough that free - free processes dominate .",
    "such a plasma can explain the observed brightness temperature of the nuclei of rqqs , if the optical depth is close to unity .",
    "this model explains the flat radio spectra observed in quasars .",
    "the authors assume that the wind is launched from the accretion disc at a radius @xmath4 pc , and becomes optically thin at a photospheric radius of 0.1@xmath51  pc . in this model",
    "the mass - loss rates in these winds are significant , and these winds could have an effect on the feedback processes operating in the host galaxy .",
    "an alternative model was proposed by @xcite , who model the radio and x - ray emission as due to coronal emission , similar to coronal emission observed in stars .",
    "they base this model on the observation that there is a rather tight correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosity : @xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath8@xmath9 , similar to the gdel - benz relation for coronally active stars . for",
    "coronally active stars it has been shown that this relation is due to magnetic heating of the corona . @xcite therefore propose that the radio and x - ray emission from the nuclei of rqqs is due to magnetic heating of the corona , presumed to be located above the accretion disc . as with the optically thin wind model , the predicted spectrum at a few ghz is flat .",
    "in this paper we test the optically thin wind model as proposed by @xcite . for",
    "an optically thin wind one can predict the x - ray luminosity for a given radio luminosity .",
    "one can then compare the predicted x - ray luminosity to the measured x - ray luminosity .",
    "the wind model overpredicts the soft x - ray luminosity @xcite , unless intervening absorbing material is present in the outflow .",
    "the absorption could arise from a radiatively cooled part of the wind further from the accretion disc .",
    "the x - ray continuum is generally well fit by a power - law and a ( modified ) black body at soft energies .",
    "the black body fits the soft excess emission probably from the accretion disc or due to ionised reflection .",
    "the power - law component is generally assumed to be comptonised emission from the corona located somewhere close to the accretion disc .",
    "alternatively , a good fit can be obtained with a broken power - law with a break energy at @xmath71.5  kev .",
    "x - ray absorbing outflows ( see @xcite for a review ) , are especially well studied in seyfert 1 galaxies , due to their x - ray brightness , which allows for high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "generally the absorption consists of 2 or more ionisation components , spanning a range in ionisation parameter of 3 or more orders of magnitude , and have outflow velocities similar to those measured at uv wavelengths of @xmath10@xmath7 100 @xmath5 1000  km  s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this outflowing gas absorbs the continuum and produces line and edge absorption , allowing for their kinematics to be studied .",
    "warm absorbers have been detected in more than @xmath12% of seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "a similar fraction of rqqs might have a warm absorber ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the exact location of the absorbing gas , even in the well studied seyfert  1 galaxies , as well as its origin , are still not well constrained @xcite , and two origins have been proposed .",
    "the absorbing outflows are thought to originate either from the accretion disc ( e.g. @xcite ) , or from the molecular torus ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the ionisation structure of the absorber is still poorly constrained , and can currently be well fit with several discrete ionisation components , modelling photoionised clumps ( e.g. @xcite ) or a continuous ionisation structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the total x - ray observed hydrogen column density in seyfert  1 galaxies spans at least 2 orders of magnitude , from 4.9@xmath1310@xmath14 m@xmath15 in mrk  279 @xcite to 3.8@xmath1310@xmath16 m@xmath15 in ngc  3783 @xcite .",

    "the expected x - ray luminosity is thus : @xmath30 where the factor @xmath31 is the ratio of the gaunt factors at these energies , and we ignore the exponential factor at the radio frequency , as it is negligible .",
    "we will use this formula to predict the x - ray luminosity at 0.5 , 2 and 5  kev .      considering",
    "that the x - ray luminosity is over - predicted in this model @xcite , we here describe a model of how the hot optically thin wind can cool to produce an absorber and derive that the required density is within a reasonable range .",
    "outflowing diffuse gas can radiatively cool to produce the absorber observed in seyfert  1 galaxies and rqqs provided that the radiative cooling timescale @xmath32 is much less than the dynamical cooling timescale @xmath33 : @xmath34 the bremsstrahlung cooling time can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the frequency - averaged gaunt factor , and @xmath37 k is the temperature of the emitting plasma near the wind photosphere . for canonical parameters , we use the values @xmath38 km s@xmath11 , @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 pc @xcite .",

    "we list the hydrogen column density a neutral ( ionised ) absorber needs to have to equate the predicted and measured 2 and 5  kev luminosity .",
    "we chose to model the neutral hydrogen column density , as the ionisation parameter of the possible absorber is unknown , and because neutral gas is more efficient in absorbing x - ray radiation , thus this gives the minimum absorbing column density needed .",
    "for the ionised absorber we chose an ionisation parameter of 1.5 ( log , 10@xmath54 wm ) , which is a rough average of the ionisation parameters observed in the well studied seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "the units for these modelled hydrogen column densities are in 10@xmath18 m@xmath15 , where a column density higher than 1.5@xmath1310@xmath18 m@xmath15 indicates a compton - thick absorber @xcite . in modelling the source we used the 2@xmath55  kev luminosity and power - law slope as given by @xcite or used the detailed models available for the 4 sources discussed earlier .",

    "a recent study of nearby seyfert  1 galaxies suggests that an absorber produced by a large scale , continuous radial flow from an accretion disc may have a density profile @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xcite . in particular , for the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 @xcite find that the observed x - ray spectrum can be described by a model with a continuous nonuniform distribution of density and ionisation parameter , suggesting that the warm absorber is not made up of clouds of ionised material in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding wind .",
    "thus our absorption model assuming just a neutral or 1 ionisation parameter is overly simplified . in seyfert  1",
    "galaxies most of the gas is highly ionised @xcite , which is less efficient in absorbing the continuum . therefore , even for the ionised absorber modelled here , the hydrogen column densities derived are lower limits , if the overall ionisation structure of the absorber in rqqs is similar to that in seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "[ fig : abs ]",
    "if the radio spectrum of radio - quiet quasars is produced in a free - free disc wind , the resultant bremsstrahlung x - ray emission must be absorbed because the observed x - ray spectrum is typically a power law , and not an exponential , and because the predicted x - ray luminosities for 0.5 , 2 and 5  kev are much larger than those measured for all the pg  quasars in our sample .    studying table  [ tab : tab2 ] , we find that the hydrogen column density needed to absorb the 2 and 5  kev luminosity are rather different . for the neutral ( ionised ) absorber",
    "the hydrogen column density is @xmath78 ( 4 ) times larger for the 5  kev luminosity than for the 2  kev luminosity , although the difference between predicted and measured luminosity is smaller at 5  kev .",
    "this difference could be explained if a more complicated absorber is present with most of the gas highly ( i.e. @xmath593 but @xmath604 in log , 10@xmath54 wm ) ionised .",
    "however , for such a high ionisation parameter , the required hydrogen column density required is further increased and becomes of order 2@xmath1310@xmath18 m@xmath15 .",
    "we find that most of the pg  quasars would need to have an absorber that is nearly compton - thick to explain the difference in luminosity between the predicted and measured 5  kev luminosity .",
    "furthermore , to be able to fit the 2 and 5  kev luminosity a highly ionised absorber with very large column density is required .",
    "if the absorbers in rqqs have similar properties to those in the well studied seyfert  1 galaxies , which one would expect to be the case considering their very similar x - ray properties such as the power - law slope and the temperature of the soft excess ( see for instance @xcite ) , is very unlikely .",
    "instead , from the derived hydrogen column densities we predict that pg  quasar spectra should be very similar to seyfert  2 galaxies , which show in high - resolution x - ray spectra an emission line spectrum in the soft x - ray band .",
    "furthermore , they have a much flatter hard x - ray power - law photon index if the absorption is not fit or severely underestimated . from a statistical point of view",
    "it is unlikely that the pg  quasar sample would be entirely consisting of those quasars with an obscuring torus along the line of sight , even - though the used sample is unlikely free from biases .",
    "is there other evidence that this is not the case ? for pg  0050 + 124 , where @xcite present a high - resolution x - ray spectrum , it can be ruled out that the source is similar to a seyfert  2 galaxy , instead it shows a spectrum that is very similar to a weakly absorbed seyfert  1 galaxy .",

    "the predicted 2  kev luminosity of this pg  quasar is 250 times the measured luminosity , which is unlikely explained by luminosity variability .",
    "therefore , for pg  0050 + 124 we are certain that the radio emission can not be due to optically thin emission from a disc wind .    for the other quasars in our sample",
    ", we have to use a less direct method , and that is to compare the measured photon index and equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line to those measured in seyfert  1 galaxies and those in seyfert  2 and compton - thick agn .",
    "the photon index for all but 2 of the studied pg  quasars is not flat as would be expected if they had a near compton - thick absorber , but varies around the photon indices measured in seyfert 1 galaxies , i.e. @xmath61 = 1.9 ( @xmath62 = 2.1 for the fitted quasars minus pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 see table  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 line stated by @xcite is rather poorly determined and dependent on the assumed width of the line , but is generally , with the exception of pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 , consistent with being too small for a compton - thick absorption model . finally , we can use the uv measured equivalent width of the c  iv 1549    absorption line . in our sample",
    "only 4 quasars show an c  iv equivalent width that is larger than 1   , although a measurement was made in all but one of the 22 quasars . as there is generally a good correlation between uv and x - ray measured absorption",
    ", this would indicate that only 4 quasars in our sample have significant x - ray absorption . from the combination of the above arguments we conclude that for all but 2 of the studied pg  quasars ( pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 ) an absorber with a very large hydrogen column density can be ruled out as an explanation for the difference between predicted and measured x - ray luminosity .",
    "could pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 , the 2 pg  quasars with a flat hard x - ray power - law as measured by @xcite have a nearly compton - thick absorber ?",
    "signatures in medium - resolution spectra of compton - thick spectra are a large equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 line and a flat hard energy spectrum , which in our case is the 2@xmath55 kev spectrum .",
    "indeed for these 2 pg  quasars @xcite finds a flat hard energy photon index : 0.14@xmath630.4 and 0.35@xmath630.1 , respectively . for the broken power - law model fitted between 0.3@xmath510  kev , the high energy photon indices for these 2 rqqs is 0.74 and 0.34 , and thus still flat .",
    "consistent with an origin of the flat photon indices due to absorption @xcite and @xcite do not derive such a flat power - law indices in their best fit model with absorber , instead they derive a photon index very similar to the canonical 1.9 measured in seyfert  1 galaxies : 1.97 and 1.9 for pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 , respectively .",
    "a second signature is the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line , which ranges between @xmath602 and @xmath60 10@xmath64 and @xmath60428 and @xmath60706 ev @xcite , and thus could be large , but is too poorly determined to be a constraint .",
    "@xcite note that the spectrum of pg  1001 + 054 has a low signal - to - noise , and that the fitted model is a poor fit ( @xmath65 = 15.6 ) to the data , but that a more complicated model is not warranted considering that only 12 energy bins remain after data binning .",
    "therefore , no fe  k@xmath0 line was fitted .",
    "@xcite does fit a narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission line and find that the emission is neutral , but does not mention the measured equivalent width of this line .",
    "however , as for pg  1001 + 054 , this is a rather low signal - to - noise spectrum , and @xcite claims that even fitting an ionised absorber is not warranted by the data quality .",

    "we have also ignored that likely at least part of the hard x - ray emission is due to comptionised accretion disc photons .",

    "we have further assumed that there is no redistribution of the x - ray luminosities , as caused by reflection .",
    "however , reflection is generally assumed to add an insignificant luminosity at 2 and 5  kev , and should therefore not greatly alter the column densities derived in this paper .",
    "an added uncertainty in comparing radio and x - ray data taken years apart is the luminosity variability observed in the x - ray part of the spectrum .",

    "these are upper limits , because any 1.4  ghz emission from the uv part of the wind , the base of the jet , the accretion disc or the host galaxy is ignored .",
    "the upper limits derived range between 10@xmath69 and 0.5 , indicating that at least is some agn the volume filling factor of the absorber is small . for at least 1 agn , ngc  3783 , the radio emission can not be explained by the observed absorber components .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that the radio and x - ray emission solely come from the same wind , whether optically thin or thick , as detected in the uv and x - ray through absorption .",
    "we have tested the theory that bremsstrahlung emission from an optically thin disc wind can explain the radio emission in radio - quiet quasars , by comparing the predicted x - ray emission at 0.5 , 2 and 5  kev to the measured x - ray luminosities at these energies .",
    "we have modelled the difference in luminosity as due to a neutral or ionised absorber , likely formed in the same disc wind , but further out .",
    "we find that all the disc winds in the pg  quasars studied would need to have an absorbing hydrogen column density that is nearly compton - thick . for 20 of the 22 pg  quasars we studied we can exclude such a large hydrogen column density from the existing medium - resolution x - ray spectra and the small c  iv equivalent width measured in those rqqs . for one rqq ,",
    "pg  0050 + 124 , there is a high - resolution spectrum , which is clearly inconsistent with the required extra absorption . for the remaining 2 rqqs : pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 we conclude that the spectra are consistent with the necessary absorption to explain the difference between predicted and measured x - ray luminosity , and that thus in these 2 quasars emission from a disc wind could explain the radio emission from the nucleus .",

    "<S> it has been proposed that the radio spectra of radio - quiet quasars is produced by free - free emission in the optically thin part of an accretion disc wind . </S>",
    "<S> an important observational constraint on this model is the observed x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this constraint using a sample of pg radio - quiet quasars for which xmm-_newton _ epic spectra are available . comparing the predicted and measured luminosities for 0.5 , 2 and 5  kev , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that all of the studied pg  quasars require a large hydrogen column density absorber , requiring these quasars to be close to or compton - thick . </S>",
    "<S> such a large column density can be directly excluded for pg  0050 + 124 , for which a high - resolution rgs spectrum exists . </S>",
    "<S> further constraint on the column density for a further 19 out of the 21 studied pg  quasars comes from the epic spectrum characteristics such as hard x - ray power - law photon index and the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0 line ; and the small equivalent width of the c  iv absorber present in uv spectra . for 2 sources : pg  1001 + 054 and pg  1411 + 442 we can not exclude that they are indeed compton - thick , and the radio and x - ray luminosity are due to a wind originating close to the super - massive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for 20 out of 22 pg  quasars studied free - free emission from a wind emanating from the accretion disc can not mutually explain the observed radio and x - ray luminosity .    </S>",
