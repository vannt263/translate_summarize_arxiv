    "the susceptibility describing the material response to an applied electromagnetic field contains both temporal and spatial dispersion@xcite . as a result of the latter ,",
    "the induced polarization at any point in the medium depends on the applied field in the region surrounding that point .",
    "this behavior can be due to a range of excitations within the material , such as phonons or excitons , each with their own associated resonance in the susceptibility . while this nonlocal response is often negligible in comparison to the frequency dependence",
    "there are cases where it can play a significant role , such as metallic nanostructures@xcite , radiative heat transfer@xcite , spontaneous emission@xcite , spectral energy density@xcite and casimir self - forces@xcite .",
    "spatial dispersion is also important in semiconductors , where the complex electronic band structure can lead to many excitations@xcite , each with their own nonlocal response . in this paper",
    ", we continue our previous work on nonlocal response@xcite by extending results on reflection and transmission at planar boundaries to the case where the medium has multiple spatially - dispersive resonances .",
    "the susceptibility is typically expressed as a sum of resonances .",
    "nonlocal response is included as a @xmath0 dependence in the model parameters , but is usually limited to a @xmath0-dependent resonant frequency .",
    "hopfield and thomas@xcite proposed the following model , based on the properties of semiconductors , but it can also be derived from a simple classical model@xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the resonant frequency , @xmath3 quantifies the absorption and @xmath4 is the oscillator strength .",
    "the term @xmath5 collects contributions from other resonances and acts as a background susceptibility . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the parabolic dispersion @xmath6 was used@xcite to describe the exciton bands in the medium , where @xmath7 is the exciton mass and @xmath8    the difficulties involved in the calculation of electromagnetic reflection and transmission coefficients for nonlocal media are well known .",
    "while there is only one transmitted wave for a local medium , the nonlocal medium has several transmitted waves due to the @xmath0 dependence in ( [ eq : susc])@xcite .",
    "the maxwell boundary conditions are no longer sufficient to solve for the unknown amplitudes of the multiple transmitted waves .",
    "historically , this need for extra information was resolved with the introduction of additional boundary conditions ( abcs ) on the polarization @xmath9 associated with the resonances in ( [ eq : susc ] ) .",
    "various authors@xcite have proposed different abcs under certain assumptions that suit different types of material .",
    "the pekar abc , where @xmath9 vanishes at the boundary , is the simplest and most commonly used .",
    "the majority of work on the subject has focused on susceptibilities with a single , isolated resonance . in this case ,",
    "halevi and fuchs@xcite have derived reflection coefficients for a generalized abc model , containing all the previously suggested abcs . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "we have adapted this model to the tensor case with different transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities .    in general ,",
    "the susceptibility of real materials is far more complex than simple isolated resonances@xcite . in exciton bands ,",
    "for example , there can be multiple closely spaced bands , degenerate bands@xcite and more complex @xmath0 dependence@xcite .",
    "while some authors@xcite have considered multi - resonance systems , they are typically limited to a maximum of two resonances and a specific abc .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to extend the halevi and fuchs@xcite generalized abc model to a multi - resonance susceptibility and derive expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "this derivation is first applied to a system with simple parabolic exciton bands and then to bands that are degenerate at @xmath10 , where we find improved parameters for the single band approximation .",
    "the second aim is to modify the derivation further to include alternate wave vector dependences , specifically the case where the dispersion in ( [ eq : parabolic ] ) contains a @xmath11 term .",
    "this behavior is known as linear splitting and is typically found in uniaxial crystals such as wurtzite .",
    "this case has been previously calculated@xcite , but only for a specific abc and orientation of the crystal axis .",
    "we will show that linear @xmath0 splitting can easily be incorporated into the multi - resonance model and that the orientation of the crystal axis has significant effects on the result .",
    "finally , we will use the derived electromagnetic reflection coefficients to calculate the spectral energy density of thermal and zero - point radiation outside the spatially dispersive medium .",
    "the results for various multi - resonance systems are calculated and compared to those in our previous paper on the isolated resonance@xcite .",
    "the assumptions made in the following derivation are discussed in greater detail in our previous paper@xcite . in summary",
    ", we consider a smooth boundary that does not contain any features such as slits or other nontrivial structures and is sufficiently far from any other boundaries such that multiple reflections can be ignored .",
    "in addition we do not include any quantum mechanical effects not directly encoded in the macroscopic susceptibility    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we assume that each resonance in the half - infinite medium can be expressed in terms of the bulk susceptibility in the same manner as halevi and fuchs@xcite : @xmath50 and the overall susceptibility is given by : @xmath51 the first term in ( [ eq : susc_u ] ) is the position - independent nonlocal bulk response .",

    "the @xmath64 result for @xmath56 is identical to that of the previous section as there is no splitting in @xmath65 for this orientation .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath67 cases have splitting in only one component of @xmath68 for @xmath12 polarized light , resulting in an @xmath57 that is closer to the @xmath69 result but also displays new features just below @xmath60 at a smaller scale .",
    "the @xmath67 results for @xmath57 and @xmath64 are the closest to the @xmath69 case as the linear term in table [ tab : chi_xz ] only contains @xmath49 . as @xmath70 ( and @xmath49 ) is decreased , the peak at @xmath60 becomes smaller , returning to the @xmath69 result for normal incidence . as in the previous section , the new peak is unaffected by @xmath71 and is larger for @xmath62 .",

    "the overall effect of the abc choice remains the same as in previous sections .    from this and the previous sections ,",
    "it is clear that if multiple spatially - dispersive resonances are present in a medium then they can not be considered separately .",
    "each of these results displays behavior not present in the single - resonance case , such as the suppression of peaks in @xmath93 associated with the @xmath12-polarization in closely - spaced parabolic bands , the difference between the heavy / light exciton model to the single band approximations and finally the additional @xmath93 peak from linear splitting in exciton bands .",

    "finally we have used the calculated reflection coefficients to find the zero - point and thermal spectral energy density @xmath112 outside the dielectric .",
    "many features are the same as the single - resonance model , such as the effect of the abc choice and the saturation of @xmath93 as @xmath113 . however , there is new behavior that is only present when the multiple - resonances are considered together .",
    "we have found that close resonances can lead to significant suppression in the peaks of @xmath96 and that single band approximations fail to capture the correct behavior of the heavy / light exciton band model .",
    "the linear splitting term led to significant changes for @xmath93 in the uniaxial crystal by splitting the peak at the resonant frequency to give an overall three - peak structure .    while the model presented here",
    "incorporates many more of the features found in real materials than halevi and fuchs , it could be extended further to include differences between the transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities@xcite or higher - order nonlocal terms .",
    "this could also be applied to other problems , such as identifying which abc is most appropriate for a medium with a complex exciton band structure , or in the calculation of casimir self - forces@xcite .",
