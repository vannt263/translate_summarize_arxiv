    "( 15 - 18 ) and ( 19 ) , we know that the device geometry , i.e. the radius @xmath56  of the arc and the angle  @xmath1 , will affect the electron transmission . by using specific fabrication method , the scale of @xmath56  is chosen over a wide range : @xmath117 nm . while @xmath118 to avoid intersection .",

    "we investigate the relationship of reflection and transmission probabilities on the radius @xmath56 shown in fig .",
    "2 . panel ( a - c ) are for different values of soi strength @xmath0 and fixed @xmath124 @xmath125 , while panel ( d - f ) are for different @xmath1 at a fixed @xmath0 . from these figures ,",
    "one can see that the electron is reflected completely at @xmath126 .",

    "we find that the reflection probabilities @xmath130 decrease to zero quickly and the transmission probabilities @xmath131 and @xmath132 . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the profiles of curves are slightly affected by the so coupling and mainly determined by the angle @xmath1 in panels ( a ) and ( d ) . from eqs .",
    "( 15 - 18 ) , one can see that the so strength @xmath0 shows its effect through the two parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "considering the ranges of all of the physical quantities , the term consisted @xmath135 is found to be smaller than other terms by three orders of magnitude at least . while for @xmath136 and @xmath137 , another parameter @xmath110 need to be considered .",
    "so both the angle @xmath1 and the soi can affect the profiles of the curves obviously , as seen in panels ( b - c ) and ( e - f ) .",

    "then the hamiltonians @xmath142 and @xmath143 in eq . ( 7 ) take the same form , the electron state should have no change through the process of transmission .    in fig .",
    "3 , the reflection and transmission probabilities are shown to be periodic functions . from equations ( 15 - 18 ) ,",
    "the periods of the reflection and transmission probabilities are derived as@xmath144the amplitudes can also be calculated .",
    "for example , the amplitude of @xmath130 is ( @xmath145 .",
    "due to the same reason as fig .",
    "2 , the profiles of @xmath130 vs. @xmath1 , including the periods and the amplitudes , are mainly determined by @xmath56 .",
    "we plot the dependences of the probabilities on the soi @xmath0 for different @xmath1 and @xmath56 in figure 4 .",
    "those oscillation vs. @xmath0 , influenced by the device geometry , remain for all of the curves . as increasing the so strength ,",
    "the soi is enhanced and can weaken the geometric potential .",
    "so one can find that the reflection probabilities @xmath146 tend to zero and the transmission probabilities @xmath131 and @xmath132 with the increscent @xmath0 .",

    "now we turn to the electron conductance . figs .",
    "5(a)-(b ) show the conductance vs. @xmath56 for different set of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . as increasing @xmath56 , the conductance increases rapidly and goes to @xmath147 oscillatorily .",
    "the changes are mainly effected by the angle @xmath148 . while the relationships of the conductance to the angle @xmath1 , plotted in figs .",
    "5(c ) and 5(d ) .",
    "obviously , one can see that the conductance is periodical and symmetrical .",
    "finally the dependences of the conductance on @xmath0 are shown in figs .",
    "5(e ) and 5(f ) .",
    "the conductance shows oscillation and goes to @xmath147 along with the increasing soi strength . as a whole",

    ", we can see that the effects of the device geometry and the soi are very small and the conductance shows a periodic variation in the @xmath151 .",
    "so these effects on the conductance may be difficult to be observed .",
    "furthermore , we consider the electron energy in a wide range , not only localized on  the fermi level .",
    "6 shows the relationship of the conductance versus the electron energy @xmath152 in units of @xmath87 for different values of the soi strength @xmath0 , the angle @xmath1 and the radius @xmath56 .",
    "one can see that the conductance also has the behavior of oscillation and goes to @xmath147 with the increase of @xmath152 . especially , there are resonant transmissions at certain energy , similar to the scattering problem of typical square well potential .    finally , we turn to the incoming electron with the mixed state . from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , one can easily see that the conductance is independent of the parameter @xmath95 . in order to study the influence on the transmission for different incoming electron state",
    ", we calculate the polarization ratio @xmath153 for the outgoing electron .",

    "it is obvious that the profiles of all curves are periodical on @xmath95 .",
    "the period of the polarization ratio @xmath154  can be found to be @xmath156 through eq .",
    "the outgoing electron state can be spin polarized when we choose the appropriate parameters . especially for the spin polarized incident electron , such as @xmath122",
    ",  we investigate the relationship of the polarization ratio @xmath154  on the device geometry and the soi shown in fig . 8 .",
    "we find that the spin state of the outgoing electron can also be polarized and just rotated around the @xmath16 direction with the angle @xmath1 as the condition of @xmath157=1 $ ] is satisfied .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived the 1d effective hamiltonian for a planar curvilinear quantum wire in the presence of rashba soi .",
    "the 1d form of the rashba soi is obtained analytically .",
    "then we consider the electron transport in a quantum wire consisting of two straight lines conjugated with an arc of a circumference .",
    "for the electron transportation of spin polarized incidence , we calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities and find that the electron transmission is influenced by three parameters : the device geometry ( @xmath1 and @xmath56 ) and the soi strength @xmath0 .",

    "the relationship of the conductance vs. the electron energy is also investigated .",
    "the electron resonant transmissions occur at some certain energy . finally , we study the influence of the incoming electron state on the electron transmission , especially the spin polarization ratio for the outgoing electron .",
    "we can achieve the rotated spin polarized electron output under certain conditions .",
    "there is one point that should be noted here . in our system ,",

    "this also makes the soi controllable  through the electron field easily . on the side ,",
    "the system without the soi on the two straight lines is also investigated and will be published later .",
    "even so , the study does give us one way to modulate the electron transmission through the correlative parameters , especially the device geometry .",
    "as an example , the device is placed on an elastomeric substrate , then the quantum wire can deform in company with the substrate .",
    "thereby the wire geometry changes when the substratum deforms ; accordingly the electron transmission changes .",
    "we may determine the deformation if we can detect the changes of the electron transmission .",
    "furthermore , this study also suggests that we may construct the custom - built device through the geometry method .",
