    "coarsening occurs when a system is rapidly quenched below a transition point into a phase with broken symmetries .",
    "the spatio - temporal evolution following a quench is relatively well known when the broken symmetry phase is characterized by a local order parameter that is spatially uniform ( _ e.g. _ the local magnetization of a ferromagnetic phase ) @xcite .",
    "the growth of spatial correlations , driven by domain growth or the annihilation of topological defects , usually obeys a dynamical scaling relation and the correlation length , or domain size \" @xmath2 , grows as a power law of time with a well defined exponent .",
    "classification schemes have been established for the main different cases @xcite .",
    "the situation is much less understood for phases characterized by a local order parameter that is spatially modulated .",
    "systems forming periodic patterns ( stripes , hexagons ) with a well defined periodicity can be observed in numerous physical systems , such as rayleigh - bnard convection , diblock - copolymer melts , magnetic materials , or turing reaction - diffusion systems @xcite . after a quench into a stripe phase ,",
    "two dimensional configurations are composed of many domains differently oriented , including grain boundaries , dislocations and disclinations .",
    "numerical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite studies have established that it is difficult , if not impossible , to reduce the ordering dynamics of stripes to one of the class known for uniform phases .",
    "there is still some debate regarding the growth mechanisms , the value of the growth exponent , whether dynamical scaling holds or not , or whether the system may involve various characteristic length scales growing with different exponents .",
    "in contrast with uniform phases , the coarsening rates depend significantly on the quench depth . far away from the bifurcation threshold of stripe formation ( large quenches ) , numerical solutions of the swift - hohenberg equation show that coarsening stops at large time , _",
    "i.e. _ the system remain frozen in macroscopically disordered configurations @xcite .",
    "based on an analysis of the law of motion of a grain boundary through curved stripes , it was recently proposed that a single growth exponent could be introduced , but for vanishingly small quenches only @xcite . from dimensional arguments",
    ", a @xmath3 growth law was derived in that regime , in good agreement with numerical results at small quenches @xcite .",
    "the freezing observed at finite quenches was attributed to the presence of a periodic pinning potential ( generated by the pattern itself ) acting on grain boundaries .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a closely related problem where similar questions remain open , and that has not been investigated numerically so far : the coarsening of _ anisotropic _ stripe patterns .",
    "oblique rolls making only two possible angles ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 , fixed ) with respect to a particular axis can be observed in electroconvection of nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "studying the ordering dynamics on this system is motivated by various reasons .",
    "first , one can intend a comparison with available experimental data , since coarsening experiments have been recently conducted in electroconvection @xcite .",
    "second , the polycrystalline structures of oblique stripes have a relatively simpler geometry than those of isotropic stripes : the constraint of the fixed angle prevents the formation of disclinations .",
    "therefore , the topological defects are essentially dislocations and ( chevron ) grain boundaries separating domains differently oriented . this situation can be seen as a smectic analogue of the structures formed by grains in polycrystalline solids , where disclinations are also absent @xcite .",
    "we consider in the following an extension of the swift - hohenberg equation for oblique stripes in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this model , proposed by pesch and kramer for describing electroconvection @xcite , is recalled in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ lowq ]",
    ", we investigate _ small _ quenches : the numerical results show that coarsening is driven by surface tension and a growth law @xmath0 is observed for various characteristic length scales , like in model a @xcite .",
    "the results qualitatively change at larger quenches ( section [ sec : pinning ] ) : the characteristic length scales associated with dislocations and chevron boundaries start to evolve differently , and the associated effective growth exponents progressively decrease as the quench depth increases",
    ". however , the effective exponent of the dislocation density remains fairly constant for a relatively wide range of quench depths .",
    "this feature can be explained by the fact that dislocations have a much lower pinning potential than chevron boundaries .",
    "we qualitatively justify this feature from weakly nonlinear analysis arguments .",
    "the dislocation exponent is close to the value of @xmath6 in that intermediate range , in agreement with the value measured in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "some conclusions are presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals is a paradigm of anisotropic pattern formation @xcite .",
    "if a nematics is placed between two glass plates properly treated , its director can be aligned along a preferential direction , say the @xmath7-axis . when an external a.c .",
    "electric field is applied in the direction normal to the plane , periodic rolls appear above a threshold . as the voltage is increased ( the frequency being fixed in some proper range ) , bifurcations to various phases",
    "can be observed : normal `` rolls , with a wave vector directed along the @xmath7-axis , usually appear first .",
    "this phase can be followed by a transition to oblique '' rolls , of interest here , characterized by a wavevector with two possible orientations with respect to the @xmath7-axis , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    although the theoretical understanding of electroconvection patterns based on constitutive equations is still incomplete , some nonlinear models that rely on equations for a local order parameter and on symmetry arguments have been proposed .",
    "some time ago , pesch and kramer introduced an anisotropic model @xcite that exhibits a transition from normal to oblique rolls : @xmath8 with @xmath9 . in equation ( [ pk ] ) , @xmath10 is a local dimensionless order parameter , interpreted as a small lateral elastic displacement ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are dimensionless constants modeling the loading forces and anisotropic bending constants ; @xmath13 is the wavenumber of the base periodic pattern , and @xmath14 a coherence `` length that will be set to @xmath15 for simplicity here .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath16 is chosen as the main control parameter .",
    "for @xmath17 the above equation reduces to the well known swift - hohenberg model of rayleigh - bnard convection ( @xmath16 is the reduced rayleigh number in that case ) .",
    "the model ( [ pk ] ) derives from a liapunov free - energy '' functional .",
    "it can be recast as @xmath18 with @xmath19.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functional @xmath20 monotonically decreases with time , @xmath21 .",
    "linear stability analysis of eq.([pk ] ) around the state @xmath22 shows that two modes of finite wavenumber @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 are unitary vectors ) become marginally unstable when the control parameter @xmath16 increases and crosses some threshold values @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 in the above relations , we have considered the case @xmath29 , the condition for which the instability at @xmath30 is to normal rolls ( @xmath31 ) . in the oblique phase , rolls make an angle @xmath32 $ ] with the @xmath33-axis . as obvious from eq.([oblique ] ) , oblique rolls can only be observed for @xmath34 .",
    "hence , when @xmath12 is tuned from negative to positive values , a transition form normal to oblique rolls can occur . in order to study the coarsening of oblique rolls , we will chose @xmath29 and @xmath34 in the following .",
    "oblique rolls have the lowest threshold value ( @xmath35 ) and we re - note @xmath36 for simplicity . as already noted by pesch and kramer , the structures that are likely to be observed for @xmath16 in the range @xmath37 $ ] may not be oblique rolls , but more complicated , nonlinear structures ( undulated \" rolls ) that are not of interest here .",
    "when numerically solving eq.([pk ] ) with random initial conditions and @xmath38 , we actually observed that oblique rolls never appeared . on the other hand ,",
    "configurations of oblique rolls very similar to those observed experimentally @xcite are always observed when setting @xmath39 instead .",
    "normal rolls were never observed in the runs presented in the following sections .",
    "this is consistent with the weakly nonlinear analysis of eq.([pk ] ) that predicts that oblique rolls have a lower free - energy @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we define the quench depth as @xmath40 with @xmath41 given by eq.([oblique ] ) .",
    "we always chose @xmath42 larger than @xmath43 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we numerically solve eq.([pk ] ) by using a pseudo - spectral method and a time integration procedure whose descriptions can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the space is discretized on a square lattice of @xmath45 nodes with a lattice size @xmath46 set to unity .",
    "the base period @xmath47 of the pattern is fixed to @xmath48 .",
    "the time integration scheme is stable for relatively large value of the time step , which is fixed to @xmath49 in dimensionless time units .",
    "the initial condition for @xmath50 is a random field with gaussian distribution , of zero mean and variance @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ t1200 ] displays in gray scale the order parameter @xmath50 at time @xmath52 time units , for a run with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the angle of the rolls with the vertical axis is @xmath55 ) .",
    "the quench depth is _ small _ , and has been set to @xmath56 .",
    "the configuration is that of a smectic polycrystal : most of the defects present are grain boundaries separating zig and zag rolls , and few isolated dislocations can be observed . due to the asymmetry of the problem ,",
    "two kind of boundaries can be roughly distinguished : horizontal `` chevron boundaries where the roll orientation changes rather smoothly from one grain to the other , and vertical '' ( or inclined ) boundaries , that are made of dense arrays of dislocations .",
    "this distinction is not very sharp , as one go continuously from one situation to the other , corresponding to boundaries of low `` and high '' dislocation density , respectively . the defect field shown in figure [ t1200def ]",
    "is obtained from fig.[t1200 ] by using a fourier filtering procedure .",
    "the dark areas correspond to defected regions .",
    "dislocations tend to be distributed along string - like structures , like in crystals .    at very large times , grain boundaries are weakly curved and isolated dislocations lying inside a grain are relatively rare .",
    "these observations agree with recent electroconvection experiments @xcite , where a mechanism for the formation of isolated dislocations was identified : a shrinking bubble can be roughly pictured as delimited by two vertical and two horizontal grain boundaries . in some cases ,",
    "the two vertical boundaries are not composed by the same number of dislocations , therefore , some dislocations can not annihilate with others of opposite burgers vector when the bubble shrinks .",
    "however , this situation occurs rarely .",
    "we study the time evolution of the defect density @xmath57 , defined as the fraction of area occupied by the black regions in fig .",
    "[ t1200def ] .",
    "we perform three series of runs at small quenches , each satisfying @xmath58 for different choices of the parameters @xmath59 ( @xmath60 respectively ) .",
    "figure [ gb ] shows a summary of the data obtained . in each cases , the results are consistent with the law @xmath61 which corresponds to a defect characteristic length scale growing as @xmath0 .",
    "this result seems to be fairly independent of the angle @xmath4 .",
    "we next investigate the time evolution of the liapunov functional @xmath20 given by eq.([liap ] ) .",
    "if @xmath62 denotes the value of @xmath20 for a perfectly ordered system , then the quantity @xmath63 represents the excess energy due to defects .",
    "the system free energy @xmath20 decreases like the total length of grain boundaries . from ( [ density ] )",
    ", one should expect @xmath64 the numerical data plotted in figure [ ener ] for small values of @xmath42 are consistent with this scaling relation as well .",
    "the time evolution of many coarsening systems is self - similar : the large scale structure of successive configurations is statistically time invariant , provided that spatial variables are rescaled by a proper length .",
    "we thereby analyze the structure factor , defined as the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function , @xmath65 , the braces representing average over initial conditions .",
    "@xmath66 is maximum for any of the ( four ) wavevectors @xmath67 characterizing zig and zag rolls . at",
    "any given time , we numerically observe that @xmath68 is maximal for @xmath69 , given by eq.([oblique ] ) . therefore , the selected stripe periodicity and orientation in the polycrystalline structure are that of the marginal wavevectors @xmath70 determined from linear stability analysis .",
    "a similar situation is encountered for the isotropic swift - hohenberg model , and is thought to be more generally a property of potential systems @xcite .",

    "@xmath87 is larger than @xmath88 by a factor varying between 5 ( at short times ) and 2 ( at large times ) .",
    "this could be due to some phase correlations of longer range than those associated with domain walls ; these features were not investigated .",
    "the above results are consistent with a coarsening process driven by grain boundary surface tension and involving a single characteristic length scale , like for the dynamics of model a for a non - conserved order parameter @xcite .",
    "the law @xmath89 is also expected to describe the kinetics of grain growth in solid polycrystals @xcite .",
    "this situation differs markedly from isotropic stripes ( where @xmath3 @xcite ) .",
    "note that the available experimental studies on anisotropic stripes have reported much slower coarsening laws than eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) , namely @xmath90 or @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "in solid crystals , for an isolated dislocation to glide from one raw of atoms to the next one , there is a finite energy cost corresponding to the raws that have to be compressed or dilated during the move .",
    "the resulting elastic force , the peierls stress , tends to prevent the glide of dislocations @xcite .",
    "therefore , dislocations tend to be pinned in positions ( periodically spaced ) of minimum energy , and motion takes place only if an external stress larger than the critical peierls stress is applied .",
    "remarkably , the defects present in systems that form periodic patterns are also subjected to similar pinning forces .",
    "their origin is nonlinear in that case , and is due to the apparition of non - adiabatic \" terms in weakly nonlinear expansions .",
    "studies on the swift - hohenberg model have shown that the laws of motion of grain boundaries ( or dislocation arrays ) involve short range , spatially periodic pinning forces @xcite . either in crystals or in patterns",
    ", the law of motion of a defect takes the general form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the defect velocity , @xmath7 its position ( for a grain boundary , the coordinate normal to the interface ) , @xmath94 a mobility , @xmath95 an external force per unit length ( _ e.g _ , the driving force for coarsening ) , and @xmath96 the magnitude of the pinning force , that oscillates with a periodicity @xmath97 proportional to the crystal ( or base pattern ) periodicity @xmath98 .",
    "peierls - like pinning forces are usually much smaller than the other characteristic elastic forces ( like the critical threshold shear stress @xmath99 ) , and have the same general approximate expression , valid both for solids @xcite and nonlinear patterns @xcite : @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the width of the defect ( see further fig .",
    "[ deepqlong ] ) , and @xmath102 a constant of order unity . for instance , grain boundaries separating domains of stripes have a width @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "therefore , close to the onset of the supercritical bifurcation ( @xmath104 ) , @xmath101 becomes very large and the pinning potential ( [ pgen ] ) can be neglected . on the other hand , as the quench depth @xmath42 increases , @xmath101 decreases and pinning forces can become large enough to affect qualitatively defect dynamics .    during a coarsening processes driven by surface tension , the average force @xmath95 in eq.([motionlaw ] ) is time dependent : @xmath105 , with @xmath106 and @xmath107 the typical interface surface tension and curvature , respectively . at short times , domains have small sizes @xmath2 , and @xmath95 is large compared with @xmath96 in eq .",

    "the driving force @xmath95 decreases with time . at some point",

    "this situation is easy to observe numerically for large quenches ( @xmath96 large ) , where asymptotic patterns remain only partially ordered ( glassy \" ) , with many immobile defects @xcite . on the other hand , in the regime @xmath110 ,",
    "defect pinning is negligible during the numerical time scales studied , and coarsening dynamics is more likely to be self - similar and characterized by well defined exponents .    for intermediate quenches ,",
    "well before all grain boundaries of a system become pinned , the peierls - like barriers are believed to slow down the ordering kinetics . at intermediate times ,",
    "one may still be able to fit in some cases the numerical results with power laws , @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 now represents an _ effective _ growth exponent , and @xmath113 .      to check whether the arguments presented above apply to anisotropic patterns as well ,",
    "we have performed calculations for deeper quenches than in sec.[lowq ] .",

    "the two classes of defects previously mentioned , the horizontal chevron grain boundaries and the dislocations , can now be clearly distinguished .",

    "the chevron boundaries are fairly straight .",
    "they remain practically immobile during the whole coarsening process , that is driven by dislocation motion only .",

    "a detail of a large time configuration ( @xmath117 ) is shown in figure [ deepqlong ] .",
    "like for shallow quenches , dislocations tend to organize along string - like structures that are generally curved .",
    "we interpret the immobility of the chevron boundary as caused by strong pinning forces . given two domains of zig and zag rolls , the stable positions of a chevron boundary are imposed by the phase of the local order parameter , which does not change across the boundary when one follows a given roll . on the other hand , dislocations are much more mobile , suggesting that their pinning potential @xmath96 is very low , and therefore strongly anisotropic with respect to the grain boundary orientation .    in the following ,",
    "we define the effective exponents associated to dislocations , free - energy and structure factor , respectively : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the dislocation density , and is determined the same way as @xmath57 in section [ lowq ] ( the fraction of black area of fig.[deepq]b ) @xcite .",

    "all exponents @xmath127 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 increase with @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ zeff ] , displays the variations of the different effective exponents as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "the dislocation exponent @xmath127 differs noticeably from @xmath128 ( and @xmath126 ) : @xmath129 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath125 is characterized by two regimes : at moderate quenches , @xmath125 gradually departs from @xmath130 and slowly increases with @xmath42 up to a value close to @xmath131 . for @xmath132 , @xmath125 then increases more sharply , the signature of a sudden increase of pinning effects . a similar behavior ( although less pronounced ) is observed for @xmath126 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath127 with the quench depth is more abrupt .",
    "the variations of @xmath127 are quite important for small and large values of @xmath42 .",
    "the most striking feature is the presence of a fairly long plateau at intermediate quenches ( @xmath133 ) where @xmath127 remains practically constant , @xmath134 .",
    "this result agrees with the experimental results of @xcite , where a law @xmath1 was reported for the dislocation density .",
    "we sketch a possible interpretation of part of the above observations , based on the fact that pinning effects are strongly anisotropic .",

    "as time goes , defected regions tend to be more composed of dislocations than chevron boundaries ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this finding disagrees with the experimental results on electroconvection , where the opposite behavior was found : a very slow growth law for @xmath149 ( @xmath156 ) , as well as a similar law for a correlation length , was reported in @xcite .",
    "hence , the experimental grains are elongated along the @xmath7 direction at late stages @xcite .",
    "we have presented evidence that the coarsening of smectic patterns , as given by a potential anisotropic swift - hohenberg equation , is characterized by a @xmath0 law close to onset .",
    "this law has not been observed experimentally so far in electroconvection of nematic liquid crystals , and may correspond to a regime difficult to reach . for larger quench depths ,",
    "the phase ordering kinetics is affected by pinning effects that strongly depend on grain boundary orientations .",
    "a particular regime is observed numerically for a fairly wide interval of moderate quenches : chevron boundaries get pinned , and grain growth still takes place via mobile arrays of dislocations .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in experiments @xcite . in this regime",
