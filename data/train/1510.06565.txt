    "our memory protocol  @xcite is inspired by related work on optical quantum memories  @xcite , adapted to the requirements of a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) setup ( see also  @xcite ) , which implies in particular working at millikelvin temperatures and microwave frequencies . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridsqmprinciple ] , the qubit and spin ensemble are embedded inside the quantum bus microwave resonator . from numerous experiments in circuit qed",
    "( see for instance  @xcite ) , it is well known that the state of a qubit can be transferred with high fidelity into the photonic state of the resonator ; we will therefore exclusively focus on the issue of quantum state transfer between the resonator and the spin ensemble .",
    "we thus assume that the resonator receives a well - defined state @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 the n - photon fock state ) from the quantum processor ( qup ) , and our goal is to store this state into the long - lived spin ensemble . for simplicity , we will focus here on the case of a single - photon fock state as input state @xmath6 - since the protocol is phase - preserving , a successful storage of @xmath7 implies the same for arbitrary states .",
    "we will use the possibility offered in circuit qed to design and operate resonators whose frequency  @xcite and quality factor  @xcite can be dynamically tuned by inserting squids in the resonator or in the coupling circuit to the measurement line .",
    "it is useful here to introduce a few elements of modelling for the coupling of an ensemble of @xmath3 emitters ( the spins in our case ) , of frequency @xmath8 , to a single resonator mode , of frequency @xmath9 , with a coupling constant @xmath10 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the resonator annihilation operator , and @xmath13 the pauli operators associated to spin @xmath14 .",
    "as long as the number of excitations is small compared to @xmath3 , it is possible to replace the spin operators @xmath15 by bosonic operators @xmath16 . introducing the _ bright _ mode operator @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath19 .",
    "denoting @xmath20 the collective ground state of the ensemble , and @xmath21 the first excited state of the bright mode , one sees that the state @xmath22 ( @xmath23 photon in the resonator ) is coupled to the state @xmath24 with a strength @xmath25 collectively enhanced by a factor @xmath26 compared to the coupling of a single spin . in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening , characterized by the width @xmath27 of the distribution of resonance frequencies",
    "@xmath28 , the state @xmath24 is not an energy eigenstate and hence is not stationary .",
    "instead it decays towards the other @xmath29 single - excitation states of the spin - ensemble manifold ( called _ dark _ modes because they are de - coupled from the radiation field ) in a characteristic time called the free - induction decay ( fid ) time @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the quantum memory protocol proceeds in two distinct steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : protocolfig]a ) . in the first step ( _",
    "write _ ) , the spin ensemble and resonator are tuned into resonance . if the collective coupling strength satisfies the strong coupling condition @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the resonator energy decay rate and @xmath33 its quality factor , the microwave photon in the cavity is coherently absorbed by the spin ensemble as an elementary excitation of the bright mode @xmath34 . after a time of the order of a few @xmath35 ,",
    "the bright mode excitation is redistributed over the dark modes , a new incoming quantum state can be written into the bright state mode . in this way",
    ", a large number of quantum states can be sequentially written into the orthogonal modes of the ensemble .",
    "the second step ( _ read _ ) consists in recovering on - demand one desired state out of the ensemble ( without perturbing the storage of all the others ) .",
    "this is achieved using a refocusing sequence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : protocolfig]b ) , based on the principle of the hahn echo  @xcite : the fid of a transverse magnetization created at time @xmath36 by a microwave pulse , due to the spread in resonance frequency of the spins , can be reversed by applying a @xmath37 pulse to the spins at a later time @xmath38 that effectively acts as a time reversal and causes the spins to return in phase at time @xmath39 , leading to the emission of an echo with a well - defined phase and amplitude relation with the initial pulse .",
    "this sole idea is however not sufficient for retrieving a single photon with high fidelity .",
    "indeed an echo generated in this way can not reproduce faithfully the quantum statistics of the initial microwave field state because the @xmath37 pulse inverts the spin excitation , and an inverted spin ensemble is an amplifying medium which unavoidably will add extra noise to the emitted photon  @xcite .    in order to reach the quantum regime , one possibility is to use a sequence of two @xmath37 pulses , in which case the initial quantum states can indeed be recovered with high - fidelity within the second echo since the spin ensemble is then no longer inverted . however this requires actively suppressing the leakage of the stored quantum information during the first echo . in optical quantum memories ,",
    "such an echo silencing can be performed by applying reversible electric field gradients  @xcite , or using propagation effects  @xcite . in cqed",
    ", one can instead detune the resonator frequency @xmath9 from the spin frequency @xmath40 during the first echo to avoid emission , and re - tune it in resonance with the spins only at the time at which the second echo is expected  @xcite .",
    "note that this idea is straightforwardly extended to the case where several quantum states are stored sequentially in the ensemble ; tuning @xmath9 to @xmath40 only at the time of the echo @xmath41 allows then an on - demand retrieval of state @xmath42 while keeping the other states unperturbed in the memory .",
    "silencing the first echo is actually not entirely sufficient to solve the issues linked to the inversion of the spin ensemble by the first @xmath37-pulse .",
    "another threat arises from the fact that an inverted spin ensemble can desexcite itself much faster than the spontaneous emission rate of an individual spin , a phenomenon known as superradiance .",
    "superradiance occurs only if the strong coupling criterion is satisfied  @xcite ; therefore , during all the time that the spin ensemble is inverted the system should be in the weak coupling regime in order to stabilize the ensemble  . in our protocol",
    "we propose to achieve this by increasing dynamically the cavity damping rate @xmath43 ; this makes it possible to switch between the strong and weak coupling regimes in the course of the experiment , as required for high - fidelity _ write _ and _ read _ steps .     and @xmath43 .",
    "quantum states @xmath2 delivered by the superconducting qubits are stored in the spin ensemble ( write step ) .",
    "a refocusing sequence acts as time - reversal for the spins and triggers the retrieval of the stored states as an echo ( read step ) . on - demand retrieval",
    "is obtained by dynamically detuning the cavity to retrieve a state @xmath2 .",
    "( b ) refocusing sequence .",
    "the refocusing sequence involves two refocusing pulse bringing back the spin ensemble in the original first excited state of the bright mode ( with most of the spins in their ground state ) . the first echo is `` silenced '' to preserve the information for the second echo .",
    "the stabilization of the inverted spin ensemble is ensured by setting @xmath44 during and immediately after the refocusing pulses .",
    "( c ) results of numerical simulations , showing the cavity field versus time in a multi - mode storage example with three input fields separated by @xmath45@xmath46s and memory time @xmath47@xmath46s.,width=604 ]    the storage time of such a quantum memory is ultimately limited by the time @xmath48 at which the spin coherence is lost .",
    "since the write step duration for a given quantum state is @xmath49 , one sees that approximately @xmath50 quantum states can be separately stored in the memory .",
    "this number can reach @xmath51 in many systems .",
    "the fidelity of this protocol was calculated numerically in  @xcite , and was shown to reach up to @xmath52 using realistic values for the physical parameters ( see fig .",

    "nv centers have very interesting electronic properties arising from their peculiar energy level scheme  @xcite .",

    "the complete nv ground state spin hamiltonian needs to be presented in some detail , since this is the degree of freedom that is used for storing the quantum information in our experiments .",
    "physically , four terms contribute to this hamiltonian : ( i ) the zero - field splitting , ( ii ) the zeeman energy shift in an external magnetic field @xmath58 , ( iii ) the interaction of the nv spin with local electric field or strain in the diamond due to the spin - orbit coupling , which causes the states @xmath59 to hybridize around zero magnetic field , and ( iv ) the hyperfine ( hf ) interaction of the nv electronic spin with the nuclear spin of the nitrogen atom , which is also a spin triplet @xmath60 for the most common isotope @xmath61 used in our experiments . in total , the spin hamiltonian  @xcite writes    @xmath62,\\ ] ]    with @xmath63 ( resp .",

    "( c ) transition frequency from the spin ground state @xmath79 to the excited states @xmath80 , in the case of a nv center having an axis along the @xmath81 crystalline direction , and with @xmath75 parallel to @xmath82 .",
    "( d ) optically - detected electron spin resonance ( esr ) hyperfine spectrum of an ensemble of nv centers in a diamond crystal used for the experiment reported in paragraph  [ sec : nvqubit ] and in  @xcite.,width=453 ]    another aspect is the optical properties of nv centers : when excited with green light , they fluoresce in the red .",
    "this is due to their excited electronic state ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hybridsnv]b ) , which is also a spin - triplet .",
    "ground - state to excited state transitions conserve the electronic spin ; however the nv relaxation from its excited state is spin - dependent : the @xmath59 state has a large probability of relaxing via a singlet metastable state ( not shown in the energy diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridsnv]b ) , which then relaxes to @xmath78 in the ground state . after a few optical cycles , the nv center spin state is therefore repumped in @xmath78 with a @xmath83 efficiency  @xcite .",
    "since the metastable state is long - lived , the fluorescence intensity is reduced if the nv spin is initially in @xmath59 compared to @xmath78 .",
    "these remarkable properties enable the optical detection of the spin state of indivual nv centers ( so - called optical detection of magnetic resonance odmr ) at room - temperature , using a straightforward confocal microscope setup .",
    "for instance the spectroscopy of an ensemble of nv centers , measured at room - temperature by odmr on one of our diamond samples , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridsnv]d .",
    "it displays the typical hyperfine structure of the @xmath84nv center transitions with a triplet of lines separated by @xmath85mhz .",
    "the interest of using nv centers for storing quantum information stems from the fact that long coherence times have been observed on the ground state spin transition in ultra - pure crystals .",
    "the coherence properties of nv centers are thus of utter importance .",
    "they are characterized by the free - induction decay time @xmath35 ( measured by ramsey fringes ) , the hahn - echo decay time @xmath48 ( measured by a spin - echo sequence ) , and the coherence time under dynamical decoupling sequences such as carr - purcell - meiboom - gil @xmath86 .",
    "it is well - established that the values found for all these times depend crucially on the local magnetic environment of each nv center  @xcite . in diamond ,",
    "the main magnetic impurities surrounding the nvs are either neutral nitrogen atoms ( so - called @xmath87 centers ) which are paramagnetic with an electron spin @xmath88 , or spin 1/2 carbon @xmath89 nuclei present to @xmath90 abundance in natural carbon .",
    "the longest coherence times were therefore measured in ultra - pure samples grown by chemical - vapor deposition ( cvd ) with very low nitrogen concentration as well as an isotopically enriched carbon source . in such samples , @xmath91  @xcite and @xmath92ms",
    "@xcite have been reported at room - temperature ; at lower temperatures ( @xmath93k ) , @xmath94s was reached  @xcite .",
    "we need relatively large concentrations of nv centers of order @xmath95ppm to efficiently absorb the microwave radiation .",
    "these concentrations are not easily reached with samples grown by cvd , and our crystals are grown by another method called high - pressure - high - temperature ( hpht ) .",
    "hpht diamonds usually have a large nitrogen concentration of @xmath96ppm . to create nv centers",
    "the crystals are irradiated ( either with protons or electrons ) to create vacancies in the lattice ; they are then annealed at @xmath97 for few hours so that the vacancies migrate and form nv centers when they meet a nitrogen atom .",
    "this method unavoidably leaves a significant residual concentration of p1 centers ( @xmath98ppm ) , which limits the spin coherence time ( both @xmath35 and @xmath48 ) to lower values than reported above . in most experiments reviewed here ( except in the last results of section  [ sec : storageretrieval ] ) ,",
    "these residual p1 centers are the main cause of decoherence of the nv centers .",
    "as explained in the description of the quantum memory protocol , the _ write _ step requires to reach the strong coupling regime between the spin ensemble and the resonator ,",
    "i.e. @xmath99 . the hamiltonian of a single nv center coupled to the electromagnetic field in a resonator is @xmath100 and @xmath101 , @xmath102 being the rms vacuum fluctuations of the magnetic field in the resonator mode at the spin position @xmath103 . restricting this hamiltonian to one of the nv transitions ( for instance the @xmath104 transition )",
    ", it can be rewritten in a jaynes - cummings form :    @xmath105    with @xmath106 .",
    "if @xmath107 is the angle between the nv axis and the local microwave field , choosing @xmath108 as the nv axis and @xmath109 as the orthogonal direction in the @xmath110 plane , one finds @xmath111 , yielding    @xmath112    since @xmath113 .",
    "the coupling constant is thus governed by the amplitude of the vacuum field fluctuations at the spin location @xmath114 . for a conventional cpw resonator as frequently used in cqed ( with transverse dimensions of order @xmath115 and a @xmath116 characteristic impedance ) , one finds @xmath117nt , yielding a coupling constant @xmath118hz for @xmath119 .",

    "this regime is manifested by the appearance of an avoided level crossing in the resonator spectrum , indicating the hybridization between the resonator and the spin ensemble .",
    "such a phenomenon was observed in @xmath130 with an ensemble of nv centers coupled to a half - wavelength coplanar - waveguide resonator whose frequency @xmath131 was made tunable using a squid - array  @xcite .    in the experiment ,",

[",

    "the 2pe consists in storing weak pulses @xmath220 containing only a few microwave photons into the spin ensemble at times @xmath228 , and applying a @xmath37 pulse at time @xmath38 which triggers the refocusing of the spins at times @xmath229 ( that is , in reverse order ) and thus the emission of echoes @xmath219 in the detection waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the storage of successive high - power microwave pulses into a spin ensemble has already been demonstrated@xcite ; one experimental difficulty to reach the few - photon regime is that the spin memory now needs to be actively reset between consecutive sequences . indeed , whereas in the experiment described in paragraph  [ sec : nvqubit ] at most one energy quantum is transferred to the spin ensemble in each sequence , which is negligible compared to the average thermal excitation of the spins ( approximately @xmath230 at @xmath231mk ) , pulses in a hahn echo sequences excite all of the @xmath232 spins , which need to come back to thermal equilibrium before the next experiment can be performed . at low temperatures , spin relaxation processes",
    "are strongly suppressed  @xcite , leading to prohibitively low repetition rates unless an active reset is implemented .",

    "the result is in good agreement with the data as shown in fig .",

    "we have presented a memory protocol able to store and retrieve on - demand the state of a large number of qubits in a spin ensemble and we demonstrated building blocks of its implementation with nv centers in diamond .",
    "the protocol requires a challenging combination of the most advanced techniques of superconducting quantum circuits and pulsed electron spin resonance .",
    "the first step , the coherent storage of a qubit state into the spin ensemble , was achieved in a first experiment with @xmath252 efficiency .",
    "the second step , the retrieval using refocusing techniques of microwave pulses stored in the spin ensemble , was demonstrated with a coherent state input at the single - photon level with @xmath253 efficiency after @xmath93@xmath46s memory time .",
    "the reset of the spin memory by optical repumping was adapted in a dilution refrigerator .",
    "finally the multi - mode character of the nv spin ensemble memory was evidenced in a multiple microwave pulses storage and retrieval experiment",
    ".      one clear drawback of the experiments discussed in paragraph  [ sec : storageretrieval ] is the spread of rabi frequencies over the whole spin ensemble , which forbids to perform well - defined rabi rotations , due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the microwave field generated by the planar resonator .",
    "this may be solved by implanting the spins at well - defined locations of a substrate , on top of which the resonator can be subsequently patterned in such a way that the oscillating magnetic field is homogeneous over the whole spin ensemble location . in a related recent experiment with donors in silicon",
    "@xcite coupled to a superconducting planar micro - resonator , mechanical strain exerted by the resonator thin - film has been shown to effectively select the frequency of spins located just below the superconducting inductance , which allowed to perform well - defined rabi rotations .",
    "although @xmath254 is already sufficient for first demonstrations , the echo efficiency would also be improved if the spin coherence time was longer .",
    "interestingly however , an important contribution to decoherence is the unavoidable dipole - dipole interaction between nv centers  @xcite .",
    "a reduced spin concentration would therefore increase further @xmath48 , but would also necessitate a larger resonator quality factor to reach strong coupling .",
    "another interesting option could be to incorporate in the memory protocol pulse sequences designed to refocus dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "a last promising direction is to rely on so - called clock transitions , where the spin frequency is stationary respectively to the applied magnetic field , which suppresses the dephasing due to dipole - dipole interactions and leads to orders of magnitude gains in coherence time even for large spin concentration .",
    "such clock transitions are found in bismuth donors in silicon  @xcite , rare - earth ions in yso crystals@xcite , but also in nv centers in diamond  @xcite .",
    "another aspect that was not discussed here is the need to use a resonator with dynamically tunable frequency and quality factor , in particular to silence the first echo .",
    "the tunable resonator design used in the experiments reported in paragraphs @xmath167 and @xmath243 is not directly compatible with the high - power microwave pulses used in our spin - echo experiments , since the microwave currents would then overcome the critical currents of the josephson junctions used as tuning elements .",
    "nevertheless , a combination of coupled linear and tunable resonators may be employed , as discussed in more details in  @xcite .    finally , it would be of high interest to measure not only the average amplitude of the microwave signals emitted by the spins , but also to perform their complete quantum tomography , in order to see if the spins add extra noise to the input signal .",
    "this could be achieved by introducing a josephson parametric amplifier in the output line , which is known to operate close to the quantum limit thus enabling to directly measure the quantum statistics of the spin - echo signal and to measure the fidelity of our quantum memory  @xcite .",
    "combining these improvements with the results reported in this article makes us confident that the realization of an operational quantum memory able to store hundreds of qubit states over seconds is within reach .",
