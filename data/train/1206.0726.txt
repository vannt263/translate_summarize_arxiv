    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) represents a milestone in the evolution of our universe , during which hydrogen gas in most of its volume changed from fully neutral to fully ionized .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one key to new insights in this area are observations of high redshift galaxies , as they will allow for the construction of a complete physical picture of the reionization process",
    ".    observations of distant lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and lyman @xmath0 emitters ( laes ) in the redshift range @xmath14 have provided the most prominent windows on the star formation history at these early epochs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "lbgs are galaxies that have been selected using broad - band surveys , which are sensitive to the ` lyman break ' in the spectra of star forming galaxies .",
    "this break is a consequence of typical effective temperatures of o & b stars , and of interstellar and intergalactic absorption of flux blueward of the ly@xmath0 wavelength @xcite .",
    "surveys for lbgs ( or ` drop - out ' galaxies ) are most sensitive to uv rest - frame continuum emission of galaxies .",
    "laes are galaxies that have been selected from narrow - band surveys which are sensitive to high - redshift galaxies that have strong ly@xmath0 line emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ly@xmath0 line originates in hii regions that surrounded o & b stars . as a result , the ly@xmath0 line flux ( and strength ) in laes are more directly connected to the ionizing photon budget .",
    "the ` strength ' of the lyman @xmath0 emission line is quantified by its rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) , which corresponds to the ratio between the line intensity and the continuum .",
    "the ly@xmath0 ew is an important physical quantity associated with galaxies during the eor for ( at least ) three reasons : ( _ i _ ) narrowband surveys for laes are typically sensitive to galaxies for which the ly@xmath0 ew exceeds some threshold value ( which can range between ew@xmath15  , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ly@xmath0 ew is clearly an important physical quantity that links the lbg and lae populations ; ( _ ii _ ) the ` first ' galaxies that formed from pristine gas are expected to be characterised by unusually large ew ( well in excess of ew@xmath16  ) , which may be one of their most prominent observational signatures ; ( _ iii _ ) recent observations of laes & lbgs in the redshift range @xmath17 have revealed an apparent non - monotonic evolution in the ew distribution , with significantly less ly@xmath0 being observed from galaxies beyond redshift @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the redshift evolution in the ew distribution at @xmath18 is likely to be connected with the reionization process rather than with secular evolution process in the galaxies ( * ? ? ?",

    "although current observations do not allow for robust conclusions , analyzing ew distributions provides a powerful technique to probe the population of star forming galaxies  as well as the ionization state of the igm  during and after reionization has been completed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that at low levels of star formation ( sfr @xmath19 yr@xmath3 ) , the effects of the statistical description of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and the cluster mass function ( cmf ) emerge . among the expected effects ",
    "gathered under the name of ` stochasticity '  the most relevant for our discussion is that the flux ratio between ionizing and far uv photons fluctuates around the mean expected value .",
    "@xcite show how the clustering of star formation together with the sampling of the initial mass function ( imf ) cause the ratio of the h@xmath0 flux and fuv flux density to fluctuate around the mean significantly for local dwarf galaxies .",
    "this effect should be also noticeable in the ratio of ly@xmath0 flux to fuv flux density i.e. the ew .",
    "in other words , stochasticity may affect the _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath0 ew - pdfs of faint lbgs ( @xmath20 ) . because ly@xmath0 ew plays an important role in understanding high  redshift galaxy populations and constraining the reionization process",
    ", it is important to understand quantitatively the impact of stochasticity .",
    "furthermore , observational constraints on the ` escape fraction ' of ionizing photons from star forming galaxies are derived from the observed ratio of lyc flux density to fuv flux density , which is subject to the clustering of star formation and stochastic sampling of the imf , especially at sfr@xmath21 yr@xmath3 .",
    "it has long been realized that such galaxies can provide the bulk of the ionizing photons needed to reionize the igm and to maintain it ionized ( at a fixed escape fraction , see e.g. fig  31 of * ? ? ?",
    "a more recent analysis by @xcite echoes these findings .",
    "@xcite show that in plausible scenarios for reionization , star forming galaxies with very faint magnitudes @xmath22 ( corresponding to sfr @xmath23yr@xmath3 ) contribute significantly to the overall budget of ionizing photons .",
    "while high  redshift galaxies with such low star formation rates remain too faint to be detected even by future facilities , the observation of galaxies with sfrs@xmath24 yr@xmath3 at lower redshifts @xmath25 can help us to understand the physics of such systems .",
    "for instance , the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies with sfr within the upper end of that range have already been constrained by observations at @xmath26 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who constrained the escape fraction down to sfr@xmath27 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "the possible dependence of these estimates on stochasticity provides an additional motivation to study the consequences of the stochastic sampling of the imf .    in this paper we set out to quantify the effects of stochasticity in the ew distribution of dwarf ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "we implement highly simplified models for dwarf galaxies at high redshift to isolate the stochastic effect .",
    "the sfh is constant , single metallicity , without any extinction effects .",
    "we stress that our objective is not to explain or interpret current observations of laes and lbgs , but instead simply to isolate and highlight the impact of stochasticity on predicted values for the ly@xmath0 ew .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : ew ] we summarize the expected effects on the equivalent width stochasticity and present the numerical experiments we perform to quantify this effect . in  [ sec : results ] we present the raw results that help us in  [ sec : discussion ] to asses the impact of stochasticity in different aspects of the interpretation of observations of laes and lbgs at high redshift .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ]    throughout this paper we will study the ` lyman continuum ' ( @xmath28 ) , ionizing continuum ( @xmath29 ) , and far uv ( fuv ) continuum ( @xmath30 ) , where all wavelengths are rest frame .",
    "whenever we refer to uv we imply fuv . also , the ly@xmath0 equivalent widths are measured in the galaxies restframe .",
    "to be consistent with observations , we define the ly@xmath0 rest - frame equivalent ew as the ratio between the intensity of the ly@xmath0 line to the flux density redwards of the line resonance , i.e. at @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "the flux density at this wavelength is @xmath33 times larger than at @xmath34  , where @xmath35 @xcite denotes the observed slope of the uv continuum at the redshift and uv - magnitudes of interest .",

    "the description of star formation is probabilistic . at its core",
    "we find the concept of the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath57 , which describes the relative abundance of stars of a given mass to be formed .",
    "the imf can be mostly determined by two pieces of information .",
    "the first one is the mass interval , @xmath58 that the newly formed stars can have .",
    "the second is the change of relative abundance for different stellar masses , which is usually parametrized as @xmath59 , if @xmath60 less massive stars are more probable to form that high mass stars .    for large masses of",
    "newly formed stars it is possible to guarantee a good sampling of the imf . for a low rate of star formation",
    "the poor sampling of the imf makes possible that the rarer most massive stars near @xmath61 do nt appear in a burst of star formation .",
    "star formation is also thought to proceed in clusters .",
    "this provides another important astrophysical element in the statistical description of star formation that can be impacted by stochasticity effects . in analogy to the stellar mass function , one can also parametrize the abundance of stellar clusters by the cluster mass function ( cmf ) .",
    "low values of the star formation rate can also affect the sampling of the cmf .",
    "furthermore , stars of different mass have different evolutionary tracks .",
    "the inhomogeneous imf sampling will produce fluctuating stellar populations with different luminosity histories , this can impact the ratio of ionizing to far uv photons produced as a function of time .    the effect of stochasticity has been explored before in the production of h@xmath0 in dwarf galaxies in the local universe , but not on the effect on the ew of lyman@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "our aim is to quantify this impact and estimate how current and future observational campaigns can be affected by these effects .",
    "we used slug ( ` stochastically light up galaxies ' ) a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the code samples the cmf and imf of a star forming galaxy by forming individual star clusters and following their spectral evolution . at low values of a time",
    "averaged continuous sfr the series of bursts associated with the cluster formation start to be visible .",
    "furthermore , low sfr values imply a low number of stars to sample the imf , lowering the probability of finding massive stars .",
    "all the effects of finite sampling in mass and time have an impact on the instantaneous strength of the lyman@xmath0 emission line .",
    "slug assumes that a fraction @xmath62 of the total stellar population is formed in clusters . in that case",
    ", the clusters also sample a cluster mass function(cmf ) @xmath63 .",
    "the stars in the cluster are then populated according to the selected imf .    in this stochastic framework ,",
    "a galaxy with a time averaged constant sfr does not level to a constant sed , but instead it continuously fluctuates in time .",
    "for a sample of independent galaxies with the same average sfr one could thus associate a distribution of line and continuum intensities .",
    "all models used in this paper are based on a salpeter imf in the mass intervals @xmath64@xmath65 .",

    "table 1 lists the exact values for the sfr and metallicity that were used .",
    "each model runs for a period of 200 myr with outputs every 1 myr .",
    "running for a period longer than 100 myr ensures a stable base level for the mean fuv and ionizing fluxes .",
    "we use the last 10 outputs per galaxy to slightly increase the statistical sample .",
    "being pessimistic , one can assume that each simulated system contributes only 1 independent datum instead of 10 , from that point of view , one can be sure that all the results for the pdf and derived quantities are accurate within @xmath73 .",
    "in other words , one might be concerned that the 10 outputs of the same galaxy may not be independent and might bias the pdf . to quantify this",

    "this shows how stochasticity can induce selection bias in laes observations .",
    "not surprisingly , the impact of stochasticity is highly sfr dependent .",
    "the strong dependence of the shape of the @xmath75pdf on sfr causes a larger fraction of systems to be found below a fixed @xmath75 threshold for detection as the sfr decreases . in figure",

    "these fractions are calculated directly from the slug models , providing an uncertainty on the order of @xmath124 in the reported fraction of detected galaxies , the discrepancy of calculating the same fractions from the fitting function is in all cases smaller than @xmath76 .",

    "however , observation targeting lyc in lbgs at @xmath171 using deep hubble space telescope imaging do not find any excess @xcite .",
    "the sources present an excess of a factor of @xmath172 times larger than the expected intrinsic stellar ratio for @xmath173 .",

    "the star formation rates for the objects with lyc excess are on the order of @xmath178 yr@xmath3 ( @xmath179 , see fig  5 of siana et al . 2010 and where we ignore dust in the conversion from @xmath129 to sfr ) . in this range",
    "@xmath180 of the galaxies will show an excess @xmath181 times the expected stellar @xmath177 ratio only due to stochasticity ( figure 1 ) , this is consistent with the fraction of galaxies observed with those characteristics .",
    "the stochasticity might also explain why the lyc excess is not observed in the recent @xmath171 hubble imaging by @xcite .",
    "the lbgs observed at that redshift have systematically restframe magnitudes @xmath182 , while the lyc excess sources are fainter than this limit .",
    "this transition roughly corresponds to a sfr @xmath183 yr@xmath3 assuming a standard conversion factor , while the fainter systems reported with an excess have @xmath184 and sfr @xmath185 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the dependence of the stochasticity effects on the sfr make it more likely to detect the lyc excess in the fainter sample .",
    "probably the stronger effect is of statistic origin , given that the observations at @xmath171 target 15 lbgs , while at @xmath186 a set of 198 galaxies were observed , this provides one order of magnitude less objects to sample the @xmath101 distribution and find galaxies with a lyc excess .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the quantitative impact of stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) on the ly@xmath0 , and ionizing photon emissivity of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have used the slug code to simulate the spectral energy distribution for restframe wavelengths @xmath187 of galaxies with time - averaged star formation rates in the range @xmath188 yr@xmath3 .    from our predicted far uv continuum flux density ( at @xmath189  ) and the ionizing flux density ( at @xmath190  ) we construct probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the variable @xmath87 that represents the ratio of the measured restframe equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath0 line to the expected constant value in the absence of stochasticity ( ew@xmath191 ) , i.e. @xmath192ew / ew@xmath191 .",
    "we find that the @xmath75pdf can be represented by a double power law in @xmath87 , whose parameters are highly dependent on the sfr .",
    "we emphasize that the results derived from these experiments are sensitive to the degree of the clustering properties of the stars . in the case of @xmath70 where the star formation is completely unclustered ,",
    "the dispersion around the mean is reduced by a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "the results are also sensitive to the star formation history assumed : in the case of a bursty star formation history , one could expect the scatter around the mean for @xmath75 to be higher than what we derive here .",
    "our results show that it is possible for galaxies to have both extremely low and high @xmath87 values  especially at increasingly low sfr  and investigate implications of this result .",
    "in particular , we show how the existence of galaxies with low @xmath87 values can induce an observational bias if galaxies are selected by cuts in the equivalent width ( as in narrowband surveys for laes ) .",
    "this bias may cause dwarfs with lower sfrs @xmath193 yr@xmath3 more likely to be missed in narrowband surveys . on the other hand",
    ", the existence of galaxies with high @xmath87 implies that a high ew can not unambiguously be interpreted as a defining characteristic of primordial population iii galaxies .",
    "finally , we use the framework presented in dijkstra & wyithe 2012 to quantify the impact of stochasticity on the predicted luminosity function and ew - pdf of a sample of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes , i.e. narrowband selected galaxies ) at a fixed redshift .",
    "we find that while stochasticity does not appreciably affect the lae abundance modeling , it may help to explain the large ew ( ew@xmath9  ) observed for a fraction of laes .",
    "finally , we have also shown that stochasticity can affect inferred constraints on the escape fraction of ionizing radiation , most strongly in galaxies that form stars at rates sfr@xmath194 yr@xmath3 .",
    "given that such galaxies are thought to dominate the reionization process at @xmath18 , it is important to consider the effects of stochasticity when using ` local ' observations to put constraints on their ionizing luminosities and escape fractions .",
    "in particular , the observed anomalies in the ratio of lyc to non - ionizing uv radiation in so - called ` lyman - bump ' galaxies at @xmath10 reported by @xcite can be explained naturally in the context of the stochastic sampling of the imf , without resorting to unusual stellar populations .",
    "moreover , the absence of such objects in a sample of @xmath195 lbgs at @xmath171 @xcite is also expected as these galaxies are forming stars at rates at which the stochastic sampling of the imf becomes negligible .",
