    "recent advances in algebraic quantum field theory have led to purely algebraic constructions of quantum field models on minkowski space , both classical and noncommutative @xcite , many of which can not be constructed by the standard methods of constructive quantum field theory .",
    "some of these models are local and free , some are local and have nontrivial s - matrices , and yet others manifest only certain remnants of locality , though these remnants suffice to enable the computation of nontrivial two  particle s - matrix elements .    in a recent paper @xcite , grosse and lechner have presented an infinite family of quantum fields which , taken as a whole , are wedge  local and poincar covariant and which have nontrivial scattering .",
    "they produce this family by deforming the free quantum field in a certain manner , motivated by the desire to understand the field as being defined on noncommutative minkowski space .",
    "however , as they point out , one can forget the original motivation and view the resulting deformed fields as being defined on classical minkowski space .",
    "it is , however , essential to the arguments of @xcite that the _ free _ field is deformed .",
    "in this paper we present a generalization of their deformation which can be applied to any minkowski space quantum field theory in any number of dimensions .",
    "this deformation results in a one parameter family of distinct field algebras which are wedge  local and covariant under the representation of the poincar group associated with the initial , undeformed theory .",
    "it turns out that also the @xmath0matrix changes under this deformation , and the deformed @xmath0matrix breaks the lorentz symmetry , in spite of the lorentz covariance of the deformed theory .",
    "when taking the free quantum field as the initial model , our deformation coincides with that of grosse and lechner .",
    "the deformation in question involves an apparently novel operator ",
    "valued integral , whose mathematical definition requires some care .",
    "apart from the operators which are to be integrated , it involves a unitary representation of the additive group @xmath1 , @xmath2 , satisfying certain properties which arise naturally when considering relativistic quantum field theories on two ( or higher ) spacetime dimensional minkowski space .",
    "we outline in sec .  2 the intriguing properties of this integral ; proofs will be given elsewhere . in sec .",
    "3 we apply these results to quantum field theories to obtain the results mentioned above . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we indicate some paths of further investigation suggested by these results .",
    "in order to draw attention to what may be regarded as the mathematical core of the deformation studied in this paper , we consider a quite general setting which covers both the case of wightman quantum field theory considered in @xcite and the case of algebraic quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "we shall assume the existence of a strongly continuous unitary representation @xmath3 of the additive group @xmath1 , @xmath2 , on some separable hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "the joint spectrum of the generators @xmath5 of @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath6 and will be further specified in the following section .",
    "let @xmath7 be the dense subspace of vectors in @xmath4 which transform smoothly under the action of @xmath3 , _ cf .  _",
    "we consider the set @xmath8 of all operators @xmath9 which have @xmath7 in their domain of definition and are smooth under the adjoint action @xmath10 of @xmath3 in the following sense : for each @xmath11 there is some @xmath12 such that the operator valued function @xmath13 is arbitrarily often differentiable in norm , where @xmath14 denotes the sum of the squares of the generators of @xmath3 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath8 is a unital * algebra .",
    "within this framework one can establish a deformation procedure for the elements of @xmath8 .",
    "the basic ingredient in this construction is the spectral resolution @xmath15 of the unitary group @xmath3 , @xmath16 where the inner product on @xmath1 is arbitrary here and will be fixed later . given any skew ",
    "symmetric @xmath17matrix @xmath18 , _",
    "@xmath19 for @xmath20 , one can give meaning to the operator valued integrals for any @xmath11 @xmath21 these left and right integrals are defined on the domain @xmath7 in the sense of distributions .",
    "moreover , the resulting operators are smooth with regard to the adjoint action of @xmath3 in the sense explained above ; hence @xmath22 .",
    "we omit the proof and only note that the above integrals may be viewed as warped ( by the matrix @xmath18 ) convolutions of @xmath9 with the spectral measure @xmath23 .",
    "the above integrals have a number of remarkable properties , which are crucial for their application to quantum field theory .",
    "we begin by noting the at first sight surprising fact that the left and right integrals coincide .",
    "[ leftright ] let @xmath11",
    ". then @xmath24 .",
    "the proof of this lemma requires the proper treatment of expressions such as @xmath25 ( which are not product measures ) as well as the discussion of subtle domain problems .",
    "we therefore forego here a rigorous argument . yet , in order to display the significance of the skew symmetry of the matrix @xmath18 for the result , we indicate the various steps in the proof . making use several times of the relation @xmath26 , which holds for any continuous function @xmath27 , we get the following chain of equalities , which are justified below .",
    "@xmath28 in the second equality we made use of @xmath29 , in the third one we relied on the fact that the preceding expression can be rewritten as a double integral , and in the fourth one we used the skew symmetry of @xmath18 , implying @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the fifth equality then follows , since @xmath32 is a c  number , and the sixth one is a consequence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the last step we made use once again of @xmath35 .",
    "it can be inferred from the defining relations ( [ intdef ] ) that @xmath36 .",
    "thus , as an immediate consequence of the preceding lemma , one finds that the operation of taking adjoints commutes with the warped convolution in the following sense .",
    "[ adjoint ] let @xmath11 . then @xmath37 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that @xmath38 , for any @xmath11 and skew symmetric matrices @xmath39 . in the next lemma we exhibit commutation properties of certain specific elements of @xmath8 , which are preserved by the deformation procedure .",
    "the shape of the spectrum @xmath6 of the unitary group @xmath3 , which coincides with the support of the spectral measure @xmath23 , enters in the formulation of this result .",
    "[ commutation ] let @xmath40 be such that @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "then , @xmath43    again , the rigorous proof of this result is plagued by technicalities and will not be given here .",
    "but the following formal steps , which are explained below , display the basic facts underlying the argument .",
    "@xmath44    in the second equality use was made of lemma [ leftright ] , the third equality relies on the fact that the preceding product of operators can be presented as a double integral , and in the fourth equality the commutation properties of the operators @xmath45 were exploited .",
    "the adjoint action of @xmath3 is written out explicitly in the fifth equality , and in the sixth equality the group law for @xmath3 as well as the relations @xmath46 and @xmath47 were used .",
    "the step to the seventh equality is accomplished by noting that the phase factors in the preceding expression cancel in view of the skew symmetry of @xmath18 , which also implies @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in the eighth equality",
    "the various unitaries are recombined into the form of adjoint actions , and in the subsequent equality the double integral is reexpressed as a product of simple integrals ; lemma [ leftright ] is then used once again .",
    "we conclude this discussion of the warped convolution with a remark on its covariance properties .",
    "let @xmath50 be a matrix group acting isometrically ( with regard to the chosen inner product ) on @xmath1 and let @xmath51 be the semidirect product of the two groups .",
    "we assume that the unitary representation @xmath3 of @xmath1 can be extended to a representation of @xmath52 , denoted by the same symbol .",
    "denoting the elements of @xmath52 by @xmath53 , one then has @xmath54 and consequently @xmath55 .",
    "it follows from standard arguments that @xmath8 is stable under the action of @xmath52 given by @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 note that the matrix @xmath58 is again skew symmetric with regard to the chosen inner product .",
    "we state the above result in the form of a lemma for later reference .",
    "[ covariance ] let @xmath11 , let @xmath18 be any skew symmetric matrix and let @xmath53 be any element of @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath59    with these results we have laid the foundation for the application of warped convolutions to quantum field theory .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of local quantum field theories in minkowski space and their deformations . identifying @xmath60dimensional minkowski space with the manifold @xmath1",
    ", the lorentz inner product is given in proper coordinates by @xmath61 .",
    "any given quantum field theory on @xmath1 may then be described as follows : there is a continuous unitary representation @xmath3 of the poincar group @xmath51 on a separable hilbert space @xmath4 , where @xmath50 is the identity component of the group of lorentz transformations and @xmath1 the group of spacetime translations .",
    "the joint spectrum of the generators @xmath5 of the abelian subgroup @xmath62 is contained in the closed forward lightcone @xmath63 and there is a , up to a phase unique , unit vector @xmath64 , representing the vacuum , which is invariant under the action of @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the underlying local field operators and observables generate a unital * algebra @xmath65 , where @xmath8 is the algebra of smooth operators with respect to the translations @xmath62 introduced in the preceding section . in the wightman setting of quantum field theory",
    "this assumption obtains if the underlying fields satisfy polynomial energy bounds @xcite . in the framework of local quantum physics ,",
    "where one deals with von neumann algebras of bounded operators , one has to proceed to weakly dense subalgebras of elements smooth with respect to the action of the translation subgroup .",
    "so in both settings this assumption does not impose any significant restriction of generality and covers all models of interest .",
    "the detailed structure of the theory is of no relevance here . what matters , however , is the assumption that one can identify all fields and observables which are localized in certain specific wedge  shaped regions , called wedges , for short .",
    "we fix a standard wedge ( see figure 1 ) @xmath66 and note that in @xmath67 dimensions all other wedges @xmath68 can be obtained from @xmath69 by suitable poincar transformations , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in @xmath72 dimensions this statement only holds true if one also includes the spacetime reflections in @xmath52 .    denoting by @xmath73 the set of all wedges in @xmath1 , we consider for any given @xmath74 the * algebra @xmath75 generated by all fields and observables localized in @xmath68 .",
    "we call the algebras @xmath76 wedge  algebras .",
    "it is apparent from the definition that @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 , _ i.e.  _ isotony holds .",
    "the covariance , locality and reeh  schlieder property of the underlying theory can then be expressed in terms of the wedge algebras as follows :    1 .",
    "_ covariance : _",
    "@xmath79 for all @xmath74 and @xmath71 .",
    "locality : _",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 denotes the closure of the causal complement of @xmath68 and @xmath83 the relative commutant of @xmath84 in @xmath8 .",

    "@xmath85 is cyclic for any @xmath84 , @xmath74 .",
    "we mention as an aside that these assumptions also cover quantum field theories on non  commutative minkowski space ( moyal space ) , as considered for example in @xcite .",
    "these spaces are described by non ",
    "commuting coordinates @xmath86 satisfying the commutation relations @xmath87 = i \\ , \\theta_{\\mu \\nu } 1 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath88 are real constants .",
    "if the dimension of the spacetime satisfies @xmath67 , there exist lightlike coordinates @xmath89 with @xmath90 = 0 $ ] which can thus be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "hence fields and observables on such spaces can be localized in wedges @xmath68 , yet they are dislocalized along the directions of the edges of these wedges .",
    "the wedge algebras are in general sufficient to reconstruct the algebras corresponding to arbitrary causally closed regions @xmath91 .",
    "these are given by @xmath92 and inherit from the wedge algebras both locality and covariance properties . yet in theories on non  commutative minkowski space , where fields and observables can not be localized in bounded regions , the corresponding algebras are trivial and consequently do not manifest the reeh ",
    "schlieder property .    given a theory as described above",
    ", we can now apply the deformation procedure established in the preceding section . to this end",
    ", we fix the standard wedge @xmath69 and pick a corresponding @xmath17matrix @xmath93 , which with respect to the chosen proper coordinates has the form @xmath94 for some fixed @xmath95 .",
    "note that this matrix is skew symmetric with respect to the lorentz inner product .",
    "the following basic facts pointed out in @xcite are crucial for the subsequent construction .    1 .",

    "indeed , @xmath107 maps @xmath69 onto itself , hence @xmath108 .",
    "after these preparations we can now proceed from the given family of wedge algebras to a new `` deformed '' family with the help of the warped convolutions introduced in the preceding section .",

    "[ def ] let @xmath74 and let @xmath110 be such that @xmath70 .",
    "the associated algebra @xmath109 is the polynomial algebra generated by all warped operators @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",

    "we will show that the algebras @xmath109 have all desired properties of wedge algebras in a quantum field theory .",
    "the isotony of the algebras @xmath109 is a consequence of the fact that if @xmath78 , these wedges can be mapped onto each other by a pure translation .",
    "hence there are poincar transformations @xmath114 , @xmath115 , with the same @xmath116 mapping @xmath69 onto @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively . as @xmath119 , @xmath120",
    "are generated by the operators @xmath111 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively , the isotony of the original wedge algebras implies @xmath123 whenever @xmath78 .",

    "so we obtain the inclusion @xmath156 . by the poincar covariance of the deformed algebras , established in the preceding step ,",
    "it is then clear that @xmath157 for all @xmath74 .    it remains to establish the reeh ",
    "schlieder property of the deformed algebras .",
    "according to lemma [ leftright ] , one has @xmath158 for any skew symmetric matrix @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath159 , since @xmath85 is invariant under spacetime translations .",
    "thus @xmath160 for any @xmath74 , so the reeh  schlieder property of the deformed wedge algebras is inherited from the original algebras .",
    "we summarize these findings in a theorem .",
    "let @xmath161 , @xmath74 , be a family of wedge algebras having the reeh  schlieder property and satisfying the conditions of isotony , covariance , and locality .",
    "then the family of deformed algebras @xmath162 , @xmath74 , introduced in definition  [ def ] also has these properties .",
    "this theorem establishes that the deformation procedure outlined above can be applied to any quantum field theory .",
    "if one starts with the wedge algebras in a free field theory , one arrives at the deformed theories considered in @xcite , as can be seen by explicit computations .",
    "but one may equally well take as a starting point any rigorously constructed model , such as the self ",
    "interacting @xmath163theories in @xmath72 dimensions or the @xmath164theory in @xmath165 dimensions @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "the warped convolution produces a true deformation of the underlying theory , in the sense that the scattering matrix changes .    to exhibit this fact ,",
    "let us assume that the underlying theory describes a single scalar massive particle .",
    "then the spectrum of @xmath166 has the form @xmath167 with @xmath168 . in the present general setting of wedge  local operators one",
    "can then define two  particle scattering states as in haag ",
    "hepp scattering theory @xcite . to see this ,",
    "we fix the standard wedge @xmath69 and pick operators @xmath128 and @xmath169 which interpolate between the vacuum vector @xmath85 and single particle states of mass @xmath170 .",
    "we then proceed to the deformed operators @xmath171 , @xmath172 and note that these operators have the same interpolation properties as the original ones , recalling that @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "next , we pick test functions @xmath175 whose fourier transforms @xmath176 have compact supports in small neighborhoods of points on the isolated mass shell in @xmath177 which do not intersect with the rest of the spectrum . with the help of these functions and the above operators we define @xmath178 where the functions @xmath179 , @xmath180 , are given by @xmath181 with @xmath182 .",
    "similarly , one defines the operators @xmath183 .",
    "bearing in mind the support properties of @xmath184 and the preceding remark about the action of the deformed operators on the vacuum vector , it follows that @xmath185 and @xmath186 are single particle states which do not depend on @xmath187 .",
    "the operators @xmath188 , @xmath183 can be used to construct incoming , respectively outgoing , two  particle scattering states . yet in the present case of wedge  localized operators this construction requires a proper adjustment of the support properties of the fourier transforms of @xmath189 . introducing the notation @xmath190 for the velocity support of a test function @xmath191 and writing @xmath192 whenever the set @xmath193 is contained in the interior of the wedge @xmath69 , one relies on the following facts . according to a result of hepp @xcite , the essential supports of the functions @xmath194 , @xmath195 are , for asymptotic @xmath187 , contained in @xmath196 , @xmath197 , respectively . moreover , the regions @xmath198 and @xmath199 are spacelike separated for @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) if @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ) , respectively .",
    "because of the covariance and locality properties of the deformed wedge  algebras , one can then establish by standard arguments",
    "@xcite the existence of the strong limits @xmath204 the limit vectors have all properties of a symmetric tensor product of the single particle states @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "in particular , they do not depend on the specific choice of operators @xmath207 and test functions @xmath189 within the above limitations .",
    "because of the reeh  schlieder property of the wedge algebras , it is also clear that these vectors form a basis in the respective asymptotic two  particle spaces .    in order to exhibit the dependence of the tensor products on the deformation parameter @xmath208 , we note that for @xmath202 @xmath209 where the third equality follows from the fact that the limit can be pulled under the integral and the symbol @xmath210 denotes the tensor product in the original theory .",
    "similarly , one obtains for @xmath203 @xmath211 these relations between the scattering states in the original and in the deformed theory become more transparent if one proceeds to improper single particle states of sharp momentum @xmath212 , @xmath213 .",
    "there one has @xmath214 the scattering states in the deformed theory depend on the matrix @xmath93 through the choice of the wedge @xmath69 and thus break the lorentz symmetry in @xmath215 dimensions .",
    "this can be understood if one interprets the wedge  local operators as members of a theory on non  commutative minkowski space , where the lorentz symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "the kernels of the elastic scattering matrices in the deformed and undeformed theory are related by @xmath216 thus they differ from each other , showing that the deformed and undeformed theories are not isomorphic . yet",
    "since the difference is only a phase factor , the collision cross sections do not change under these deformations .",
    "hence the effects of the deformation , such as the asymptotic breakdown of lorentz invariance , could only be seen in certain specific arrangements such as time delay experiments .",
    "in the present article we have presented a generalization of the deformation procedure of free quantum field theories , established by grosse and lechner @xcite , to the general setting of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "even though the new theories which emerge in this way may not be of direct physical relevance , the results are of methodical interest . for they reveal yet again the significance of the wedge algebra in the algebraic approach to the construction of models .    from the algebraic point of view",
    "the problem of constructing a quantum field theory presents itself as follows .",
    "given the stable particle content in the situation to be described , one first constructs a corresponding fock space and representation @xmath3 of the poincar group @xmath52 . a theory with this particle content",
    "is then obtained by fixing a wedge @xmath69 , say , and exhibiting a * algebra @xmath217 which can be interpreted as the algebra generated by fields and observables localized in @xmath69 .",
    "it thus has to satisfy the conditions      any algebra @xmath223 satisfying these conditions is the germ of a quantum field theory in the following sense : setting @xmath224 , where @xmath71 is such that @xmath70 for given @xmath74 , it is an immediate consequence of the assumed properties of @xmath225 that the definition of the wedge algebras @xmath84 is consistent and satisfies the conditions of isotony , covariance and locality . as explained above , the algebras corresponding to arbitrary causally closed regions",
    "can then consistently be defined by taking intersections of wedge algebras .",
    "conversely , any asymptotically complete quantum field theory with the given particle content fixes an algebra @xmath223 with the above properties .",
    "thus any quantum field theory can in principle be presented in this way . however , at present a dynamical principle by which the algebras @xmath223 can be selected is missing .    nevertheless , this algebraic approach has already proven to be useful in the construction of interesting examples of quantum field theories .",
    "for instance , the existence of an infinity of models in @xmath72 spacetime dimensions with non  trivial scattering matrix was established in this setting in @xcite , thereby solving a longstanding problem in the so  called form factor program of quantum field theory , _ cf .  _",
    "@xcite and references quoted there .",
    "wedge algebras associated with a nonlocal field in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions were used in @xcite to construct local observables manifesting non  trivial scattering .",
    "wedge algebras were also used in @xcite for the construction of quantum field theories describing massless particles with infinite spin , _ cf .  _",
    "also @xcite for a construction of operators in these theories with somewhat better localization properties .",
    "the idea of deforming given wedge algebras in order to arrive at new theories is a quite recent development in the algebraic approach and sheds new light on the constructive problems in quantum field theory .",
    "one may expect that the particular deformation procedure considered here is only an example of a richer family of similar constructions .",
    "moreover , these methods can also be transferred to quantum field theories on curved spacetimes with a sufficiently big isometry group .",
    "it is an intriguing question in this context to find manageable criteria which allow one to decide whether the intersections of wedge algebras are non  trivial . in @xcite",
    "such a criterion based on the modular structure was put forward .",
    "unfortunately , it is only meaningful in @xmath72 spacetime dimensions . in the examples of deformed theories in @xmath67 spacetime dimensions discussed here",
    ", it can be shown that the algebras corresponding to bounded spacetime regions are trivial .",
    "but , viewing the deformed theory as living on non  commutative minkowski space @xcite , one may expect that the algebras corresponding to the intersection of two opposite wedges are non  trivial .",
