    "<S> this suggest the existence of incompatible quantum measurements which are bell local , similarly to certain entangled states which admit a local hidden variable model .    the correlations resulting from local measurements on an entangled quantum state can not be explained by a local theory . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect of entanglement , termed quantum nonlocality , is captured by two inequivalent notions , namely bell nonlocality @xcite and epr steering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest form of this phenomenon is bell nonlocality , witnessed via the violation of bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> steering represents a strictly weaker form of quantum nonlocality @xcite , witnessed via violation of steering inequalities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both aspects have been extensively investigated in recent years , as they play a central role in the foundations of quantum theory and in quantum information processing .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly quantum nonlocality is based on two central features of quantum theory , namely entanglement and incompatible measurements . specifically , performing ( i ) arbitrary local measurements on a separable state , or ( ii ) compatible measurements on an ( arbitrary ) quantum state </S>",
    "<S> can never lead to any form of quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> hence the observation of quantum nonlocality implies the presence of both entanglement and incompatible measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to explore the converse problem . </S>",
    "<S> two types of questions can be asked here ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) : ( a ) do all entangled states lead to quantum nonlocality ? </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) do all sets of incompatible measurements lead to quantum nonlocality ?    </S>",
    "<S> an intense research effort has been devoted to question ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , it was shown that all pure entangled states violate a bell inequality @xcite , hence also demonstrating epr steering . </S>",
    "<S> for mixed states , the situation is much more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> there exist entangled states which are local , in the sense that no form of quantum nonlocality can be demonstrated with such states when using non - sequential measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these issues become even more subtle when more sophisticated measurement scenarios are considered @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> question ( b ) has received much less attention so far . in the case of projective measurements </S>",
    "<S> , it was shown that incompatible measurements can always lead to bell nonlocality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this case , compatibility is uniquely captured by the notion of commutativity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for general measurements , _ i.e._positive - operator - valued - measures ( povms ) , no general result is known . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there are several inequivalent notions of compatibility . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the notion of joint measurability , see e.g.@xcite , as this represents a natural choice in the context of quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> several works discussed question ( b ) for povms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest result is due to wolf et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who showed that any set of two incompatible povms with binary outcomes can always lead to violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> however , this result may not be extended to the general case ( of an arbitrary number of povms with arbitrarily many outcomes ) , since pairwise joint measurability does not imply full joint measurability in general @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the relation between compatibility of general quantum measurements and quantum nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> we start by demonstrating a direct link between joint measurability and epr steering . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that for any set of povms that is incompatible ( _ i.e._not jointly measurable ) , one can find an entangled state , such that the resulting statistics violates a steering inequality . </S>",
    "<S> hence the use of incompatible is a necessary and sufficient ingredient for demonstrating epr steering .    </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of how joint measurability relates to bell nonlocality . specifically , the question is whether , for any set of incompatible povms ( for alice ) , one can find an entangled state and a set of local measurements ( for bob ) , such that the resulting statistics violates a bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> here we give evidence that the answer is negative . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we exhibit sets of incompatible measurements which can provably not violate a large class of bell inequalities ( including all full correlation bell inequalities , also known as xor games , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conjecture that non joint measurability and bell nonlocality are inequivalent . hence , similarly to local entangled states </S>",
    "<S> , there may exist incompatible quantum measurements which are bell local .    _ steering vs joint measurability . </S>",
    "<S> _ we start by defining the relevant scenario and notations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two separated observers , alice and bob , performing local measurements on a shared quantum state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> alice s measurements are represented by operators @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the choice of measurement and @xmath4 its outcome . upon performing measurement @xmath3 , and obtaining outcome @xmath4 , the ( unnormalized ) state held by bob </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath5 the set of unnormalised states @xmath6 , referred to as an _ assemblage _ , completely characterizes the experiment , since @xmath7 is the probability of alice getting the output @xmath4 ( for measurement @xmath3 ) and given that information and bob s state is described by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , one has that @xmath9 for all measurements @xmath10 and @xmath11 , ensuring that alice can not signal to bob .    in a steering test @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> alice want to convince bob that the state @xmath0 is entangled , and that she can steer his state . </S>",
    "<S> bob does not trust alice , and thus wants to verify alice s claim . asking alice to perform a given measurement @xmath3 , and to announce the outcome @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , bob can determine the assemblage @xmath12 via local quantum tomography . to ensure that steering did indeed occur , </S>",
    "<S> bob should verify that the assemblage does not admit a decomposition of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 . clearly , </S>",
    "<S> if a decomposition of the above form exists , then alice could have cheated by sending the ( unentangled ) state @xmath15 to bob and announce outcome @xmath4 to bob according to the distribution @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> note that here @xmath17 represents a local variable of alice , representing her choice of strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> assemblages of the form are termed unsteerable and form a convex set @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence any steerable assemblage can be detected via a set of linear witnesses called steering inequalities @xcite . by observing violation of a steering inequality </S>",
    "<S> , bob will therefore be convinced that alice can steer his state .    for a demonstration of steering , it is necessary for the state @xmath0 to be entangled . </S>",
    "<S> however , not all entangled states can be used to demonstrate steering @xcite ; at least not when non - sequential measurements are performed on a single copy of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , steering also requires that the measurements performed by alice are incompatible . to capture the compatibility of a set of quantum measurements we use here the notion of joint measurability , see e.g. @xcite </S>",
    "<S> a set of @xmath18 povms @xmath1 is called jointly measurable if there exists a measurement @xmath19 with outcome @xmath20 $ ] where @xmath21 gives the outcome of measurement @xmath3 , that is @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the elements of @xmath24 except for @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , all povm elements @xmath1 are recovered as marginals of the _ mother observable _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the joint measurability of a set of povms does not imply that they commute @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence joint measurability is a strictly weaker notion of compatibility for povms . moreover , joint measurability is not transitive . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , </S>",
    "<S> pairwise joint measurability does not imply full joint measurability in general @xcite ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is to establish a direct link between joint measurability and steering . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that a set of povms can be used to demonstrate steering if and only if it is not jointly measurable . </S>",
    "<S> more formally we prove the following result .    </S>",
    "<S> the assemblage @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , is unsteerable for any state @xmath0 acting in @xmath28 if and only if the set of povms @xmath29 acting on @xmath30 is jointly measurable .    </S>",
    "<S> the if part is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to show that @xmath26 admits a decomposition of the form when @xmath29 is jointly measurable , for any state @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> consider @xmath19 , the mother observable for @xmath29 , and define alice s local variable to be @xmath31 , distributed according to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> next alice sends the local state @xmath34 . when asked by bob to perform measurement @xmath3 , alice announces an outcome @xmath4 according to @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now move to the only if part . </S>",
    "<S> consider an arbitrary pure state @xmath36 with schmidt number @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that we can always write @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an ( unormalized ) maximally entangled state in @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is diagonal matrix that contains only strictly positive numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the assemblage resulting from a set of povms @xmath29 on @xmath0 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the transpose of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is now to show that if @xmath45 is unsteerable then @xmath29 is jointly measurable . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath45 is unsteerable , we have that @xmath46 which allows us to define the positive definite operator @xmath47 form which we can recover the assemblage @xmath48 as marginals , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e._@xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> since the diagonal matrix @xmath41 is invertible , we can define @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to check that @xmath19 is a mother observable for @xmath51 : ( i ) it is positive , ( ii ) sums to identity , and ( iii ) has povm elements @xmath44 as marginals . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath51 is jointly measurable , which concludes the proof . </S>",
    "<S> note finally an interesting point that follows from the above . considering a set of incompatible measurements acting on @xmath30 , any pure entangled state of the schmidt number @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> can be used to demonstrate epr steering .    </S>",
    "<S> _ bell nonlocality vs joint measurability . </S>",
    "<S> _ it is natural to ask whether the above connection , between joint measurability and steering , can be extended to bell nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in a bell test , both observers alice and bob are on the same footing , and test the strength of the shared correlations . specifically </S>",
    "<S> , alice chooses a measurement @xmath3 ( bob chooses @xmath52 ) and gets outcome @xmath4 ( bob gets @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation is thus described by a joint probability distribution @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be reproduced by a pre - determined classical strategy if it admits a decomposition of the form @xmath55 where @xmath17 represents the shared local ( hidden ) variable , and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> any distribution that does not admit a decomposition of the above form is said to be bell nonlocal . </S>",
    "<S> the set of local distributions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e._of the form is convex , and can thus be characterized by a set of linear inequalities called bell inequalities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence violation of a bell inequality implies bell nonlocality .    in quantum theory , bell </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal distributions can be obtained by performing suitably chosen local measurements , @xmath1 and @xmath57 , on an entangled state @xmath0 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting distribution @xmath58 does not admit a decomposition of the form . </S>",
    "<S> bell nonlocality is however not a generic feature of entangled quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there exist mixed entangled states which are local , in the sense that the statistics resulting from arbitrary non - sequential local measurements can be reproduced by a local model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given the above , we investigate now how joint measurability relates to bell nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> first the above theorem implies that , if the set of povms @xmath59 used by alice is jointly measurable , then the statistics @xmath54 can always be reproduced by a local model , for any state @xmath0 and measurements of bob @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the converse problem is much more interesting . </S>",
    "<S> the question is whether for any set of povms @xmath59 that is not jointly measurable , there exists a state @xmath0 and a set of measurements @xmath60 such that the resulting statistics @xmath54 violates a bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this was shown to hold true for the case of sets of two povms with binary outcomes @xcite . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> joint measurability is equivalent to violation of the chsh bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> here we give evidence that this connection does not hold in general . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we exhibit a set of povms which is not jointly measurable but nevertheless can not violate a large class of bell inequalities .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the set of three dichotomic povms ( acting on @xmath61 ) given by the following positive operators @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one has that @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this set of povms should be understood as noisy pauli measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the set is jointly measurable if and only if @xmath67 , although any pair of povms is jointly measurable for @xmath68 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence in the range @xmath69 , the set @xmath70 forms a _ hollow triangle _ : it is pairwise jointly measurable but not fully jointly measurable .    </S>",
    "<S> we now investigate whether the above hollow triangle can lead to bell inequality violation . </S>",
    "<S> the most general class of bell inequalities to be considered here are of the form  : @xmath71 where @xmath72 all ( tight ) bell inequalities of the above form for @xmath73 are known ( see appendix ) . using a numerical method based on semi - definite - programming ( sdp ) @xcite ( see appendix ) </S>",
    "<S> we could find the smallest value of the parameter @xmath74 for which a given inequality can be violated using the set of povms . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized in table i. notably , we could not find a violation in the range @xmath69 where the set @xmath70 is a hollow triangle . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , no violation was found for @xmath75 , whereas pairwise joint measurability is achieved for @xmath76 , thus leaving a large gap . </S>",
    "<S> note also that pairwise joint measurability implies violation of the chsh inequality here , since we have povms with binary outcomes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conjecture that there is a threshold value @xmath77 , such that all hollow triangles with @xmath78 do not violate any bell inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> [ table ]    . </S>",
    "<S> bell inequality violation with incompatible povms . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider the sets given in equations and . </S>",
    "<S> for each set , we determine the smallest value of the parameter @xmath74 , such that the set becomes jointly measurable ( jm ) , and achieve bell inequality violation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider tight bell inequalities with up to @xmath79 measurements for bob ( see appendix ) . </S>",
