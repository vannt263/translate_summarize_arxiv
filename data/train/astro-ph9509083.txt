    "the ap calculations were made for he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si and s. the total radiative recombination coefficient was considered as a sum of recombination coefficients to the ground level and to all the excited levels . the ground level recombination coefficients were evaluated by use of the milne relation ( see , e.g. , bates & dalgarno 1962 ) from the photoionization cross sections known in early seventies ; for many species , extrapolations of the cross sections along isoelectronic sequences were necessary due to lack of data .",
    "for all the excited levels , the hydrogenic approximation was assumed .",
    "the calculated radiative recombination coefficients were fitted by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is temperature , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fitting parameters .",

    "gould ( 1978 ) introduced corrections to the hydrogenic formula for the radiative recombination coefficients to the excited levels of nonhydrogenic species .",
    "he provided more accurate total radiative recombination coefficients for the first four ionization states of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar at @xmath10  k , and for the neutral species of these elements at @xmath11  k. pequignot , petitjean , & boisson ( 1991 ) used updated photoionization cross sections from the ground and first excited ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) states of all ions of he , c , n , o , and ne for calculation of the radiative recombination coefficients . all levels @xmath14 were assumed to be hydrogenic .",

    ". however , the hds method may give significant errors near the thresholds of the outer shells , especially for neutral and low - ionized species .",
    "use of the fits to the hds photoionization cross sections for evaluation of the radiative recombination rates may lead to large errors in the low - temperature rates for neutral and low - ionized species .",
    "the recent opacity project ( op ) calculations ( seaton et al . 1992 ) give more accurate low - energy photoionization cross sections obtained by the r - matrix method ( burke et al .",

    "unfortunately the op calculations do not include high - energy photoionization cross sections ; these are required for high - temperature radiative recombination rates .",
    "moreover , the op database topbase ( cunto et al . 1993 ) contains only total photoionization cross sections which are not appropriate for use with the milne relation .    for the most ionic species ,",
    "the total recombination rates are dominated by dielectronic recombination ( burgess 1964 ; nussbaumer & storey 1984 , 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "the exceptions are h - like ions which are not subject to dielectronic recombination at all , and he - like , li - like and na - like species which do not have low - lying autoionization states and therefore are not subject to low - temperature dielectronic recombination ( the process discussed in the papers by nussbamer & storey ) .",
    "thus , the rates of radiative recombination towards he - like , li - like and na - like ions described here should be the total recombination rate at nebular temperatures , and only need to be supplemented by high - temperature dielectronic recombination .",
    "in this paper , we present the calculations and analytic fits to the rates of radiative recombination towards h - like , he - like , li - like and na - like ions of all elements from h through zn ( @xmath0 ) . for calculation of the ground level recombination rate coefficients for he - like , li - like and na - like ions , we used the updated version of the analytic fits to the photoionization cross sections ( verner et al .",

    "we used the hydrogenic approximation for levels with @xmath41 ( the species listed above ) and for levels with @xmath42 ( five and more times ionized species ) .    to estimate uncertainty of the gould method ,",
    "we have made more detailed calculations of the radiative recombination rates for .",
    "this is motivated by the importance of this process in measurements of the primordial helium abundance ( reeves 1992 ) .",
    "we used the op partial photoionization cross sections ( fernley , taylor , & seaton 1987 ) of 40 low - lying excited levels with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 levels ) to obtain recombination rates to these levels .",
    "all levels with @xmath51 were assumed hydrogenic .",
    "then we compared the obtained total radiative recombination rates with those calculated by the gould method . at @xmath52",
    "k , the discrepancies between these two methods are less than 1% , since the main contribution to the total rate at these temperatures comes from the recombination to highly excited hydrogenic levels . at @xmath53",
    "k , the discrepancies begin to increase with increasing temperature , and reach a maximum of 10% at @xmath54  k. at higher @xmath7 , the discrepancies decrease again , since the main contribution to the total rate at high temperature comes from the ground state recombination .",
    "thus , we can estimate that the accuracy of the gould method is not worse than 10% .",
    "the comparison of experimental and fitted photoionization cross sections of neutrals ( he , li , na ) reveal that the accuracy of the fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections is better than 10% also . therefore , the absolute accuracy of the calculated total radiative recombination rates presented here is not worse than 10% for neutrals , and must be better for ions .",
    "careful integration of the milne relation and use of the photoionization cross sections which are accurate as near the thresholds as at high energies ensure the high accuracy of the total recombination rate coefficients in a wide range of temperature .",
    "we calculated all the rates from 3  k to @xmath55  k using non - relativistic photoionization cross sections .",
    "however , at temperatures above @xmath56  k , relativistic corrections may be important for high-@xmath31 ions .",
    "as we have mentioned , the largest contribution to the total recombination at @xmath57  k comes from the recombination to the ground level .",
    "our fits for the ground level photoionization cross sections of h and he agree within 2% with the experimental cross sections ( veigele 1973 ) at energies up to 1  mev .",
    "thus , the given recombination rates coefficients are accurate at temperatures up to @xmath58  k for low-@xmath31 ions . for high-@xmath31 ions ,",
    "@xmath59  k is more secure upper limit .",
    "we fitted all the total rate coefficients obtained in the temperature range from 3  k to @xmath55  k using the formula @xmath60^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the fitting parameters .",
    "formula ( 4 ) ensures correct asymptotic behavior of the rate coefficients ( ferland et al .",
    "1992 ) as at low as at high temperatures : @xmath63 at @xmath64 , and @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the average accuracy of fitting is better than 2% ( maximum error is less than 3% ) for he - like ions and better than 4% ( maximum error is less than 6% ) for all li - like and na - like species .",
    "the errors of fitting are smaller for highly - ionized species .",
    "note that although all the fits are accurate in comparison with the calculated data up to @xmath55  k , the upper limits of validity ( @xmath67  k for high-@xmath31 ions , and @xmath58  k for low-@xmath31 ions ) are determined by non - relativistic character of the calculations .    because of its importance for cosmological problems , we present two fits for the rates which are calculated by more detailed method ( see above ) .",
    "the first fit is valid at @xmath68  k ( the rms average error is 2.5% , maximum error 5% ) .",
    "note that the high - temperature dielectronic recombination rate at @xmath69  k is two orders of magnitude larger than the radiative recombination rate at this temperature .",
    "the second fit is valid for all temperatures from @xmath70  k up to @xmath71  k ( the rms average error is 5% , maximum error 10% )",
    ". the errors of fitting for all species under study are not higher than the estimated absolute errors .",
    "therefore , our fitting does not lead to any loss of accuracy in comparison with the calculated data .",
    "we also fitted the recombination rate coefficients for all the h - like ions .",
    "generally , the rate coefficients for all hydrogenic species can be obtained from the rate coefficient by use of the relation @xmath72 however , for user s convenience we provide the separate fits to all the hydrogenic species which ensure the uniform accuracy of the fitting for all ions in the same temperature range 3  k@xmath55  k. the rms relative errors of the fits for all hydrogenic species are less than 0.5% , the maximum errors are less than 1% .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in table 1 .",

    "the corresponding fit parameters are available from the authors upon request .",
    "the accuracy of fitting of the partial rate coefficients is generally slightly lower than that of the total radiative recombination rates coefficients .",
