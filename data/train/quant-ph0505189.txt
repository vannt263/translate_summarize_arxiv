    "in a previous paper @xcite we proposed simple models for an `` atom diode '' , a laser device that lets the neutral atom in its ground state pass in one direction ( conventionally from left to right ) but not in the opposite direction for a range of incident velocities .",
    "a diode is a very basic control element in a circuit , so many applications may be envisioned to trap or cool atoms , or to build logic gates for quantum information processing in atom chips or other setups .",
    "similar ideas have been developed independently by raizen and coworkers @xcite .",
    "while their work has emphasized phase space compression , we looked for the laser interactions leading to the most effective diode .",
    "this lead us to consider first stirap @xcite ( stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) transitions and three level atoms , although we also proposed schemes for two - level atoms . in this paper",
    "we continue the investigation on the atom diode , concentrating on its two - level version , by examining its stability with respect to parameter changes , and also several variants , including in particular the ones discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the behaviour of the diode , its properties , and its working parameter domain can be understood and quantified with the aid of an adiabatic basis ( equivalently , partially dressed states ) obtained by diagonalizing the effective interaction potential .",
    "we restrict the atomic motion , similarly to @xcite , to one dimension .",
    "this occurs when the atom travels in waveguides formed by optical fields @xcite , or by electric or magnetic interactions due to charged or current - carrying structures @xcite",
    ". it can be also a good approximation in free space for atomic packets which are broad in the laser direction , perpendicular to the incident atomic direction @xcite .",
    "three dimensional effects should not imply a dramatic disturbance , in any case , as we shall analyze elsewhere .",

    "[ fig1 ] , and consists of three , partially overlapping laser fields : two of them are state - selective mirror lasers blocking the excited ( @xmath0 ) and ground ( @xmath1 ) states on the left and right , respectively of a central pumping laser on resonance with the atomic transition .",
    "they are all assumed to be traveling waves perpendicular to the atomic motion direction .",
    "the corresponding effective , time - independent , interaction - picture hamiltonian for the two - level atom may be written , using @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the rabi frequency for the resonant transition and the effective reflecting potentials are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the momentum operator and @xmath9 is the mass ( corresponding to neon in all numerical examples ) .",
    "spontaneous decay is neglected here for simplicity , but it could be incorporated following @xcite .",
    "it implies both perturbing and beneficial effects for unidirectional transmission .",
    "notice that in the ideal diode operation the ground state atom must be excited during its left - to - right crossing of the device . in principle , excited atoms could cross the diode `` backwards '' , i.e. , from right to left , but an irreversible decay from the excited state to the ground state would block any backward motion @xcite .    the behaviour of this device is quantified by the scattering transmission and reflection amplitudes for left ( l ) and right ( r ) incidence . using @xmath10 and @xmath11 to denote the channels , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) the scattering amplitudes for incidence with modulus of velocity @xmath16 from the left ( right ) in channel @xmath10 , and reflection in channel @xmath11 .",
    "similarly we denote by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) the scattering amplitude for incidence in channel @xmath10 from the left ( right ) and transmission in channel @xmath11 .    for some figures ,",
    "it will be preferable to use an alternative notation in which the information of the superscript ( @xmath19 ) is contained instead in the sign of the velocity argument @xmath20 , positive for left incidence and negative otherwise , r_(w):= \\ {    ll r^l_(| w | ) , & if w>0 + r^r_(| w | ) , & if w<0    . + t_(w):= \\",

    "this was achieved in @xcite with a particular choice of the potential in which @xmath5 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 were related to two partially overlapping functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 . however , other forms are also possible , so we shall deal here with the more general structure of eq .",

    "they are explained in section [ s4 ] with the aid of an adiabatic basis and approximation .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and an appendix on the adiabaticity criterion .",

    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "note in passing that the device works as a diode for incidence in the excited state too , but in the opposite direction , namely , @xmath34 , whereas all other probabilities for incidence in the excited state are approximately zero .",
    "now let us examine the stability of the diode with respect to changes in the separation between laser field centers @xmath35 .",
    "we define @xmath36 and @xmath37 as the upper and lower limits where diodic behaviour holds , by imposing that all scattering probabilities from the ground state be small except the ones in eq .",
    "( [ di1 ] ) ( i.e. , the transmission probability from @xmath38 to @xmath39 for left incidence and the reflection probability from @xmath38 to @xmath38 for right incidence ) .",

    "unfilled boxes indicate reflection failure for right incidence and filled circles indicate transmission failure for left incidence . in the @xmath37 surface ,",
    "the failure is always due to transmission failure for left incidence .",
    "we see that the valid @xmath35 range for `` diodic '' behaviour can be increased by increasing the rabi frequency @xmath43 , compare e.g. ( a ) and ( b ) , or ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "moreover , higher mirror intensities increase @xmath36 at the plateau but also make it narrower , compare e.g. ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "this narrowing can be simply compensated by increasing @xmath43 too , compare e.g. ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "finally , we have also examined the stability with respect to a shift @xmath46 of the central position of the pumping laser , see fig .",
    "it turns out that there is a range , which depends on @xmath35 , where the limits @xmath37 and @xmath36 practically do not change .",
    "is the mirror potential @xmath47 really necessary ?",
    "if we want ground state atoms to pass from left to right but not from right to left , it is not intuitively obvious why we should add a reflection potential for the excited state on the left of the pumping potential @xmath48 , see again fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in other words , it could appear that the pumping potential and a reflecting potential @xmath49 on its right would be enough to make a perfect diode . this simpler two - laser scheme , however , only works partially . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the scattering probabilities for the case @xmath50 , @xmath51 are represented . while there is still full reflection",
    "if the atom comes from the right , the transmission probability is only @xmath52 when the atom comes from the left ; accordingly there is a @xmath52 reflection probability from the left , which is equally distributed between the ground and excited state channels .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath53 , @xmath54 case of fig [ fig2 ] .",
    "we may thus conclude that the counterintuitive state - selective mirror @xmath47 is really important to attain a perfect diode .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the case @xmath55 , @xmath56 is also plotted . for incidence from the right in the ground state",
    "there is no full reflection so this case is not useful as a diode .",
    "but for incidence from the left there is equal transmission in ground and excited states so that this device might be useful to build an interferometer . a very remarkable and useful property in this case , and in fact in all cases depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] , is the constant value of the transmission and reflection probabilities in a broad velocity range .",
    "this is calling for an explanation .",
    "moreover , why do they take the values @xmath38 , @xmath52 , or @xmath57 ?",
    "none of these facts is very intuitive , neither within the representations and concepts we have put forward so far , nor according to the following arguments : let us consider again the simple two - laser configuration with @xmath58 and @xmath53 . from a classical perspective , the atom incident from the left finds first the pumping laser and then the state - selective mirror potential for the ground state . according to this `` sequential '' model",
    ", one would expect an important effect of the velocity in the pumping efficiency .",
    "a different velocity implies a different traversal time and thus a different final phase for the rabi oscillation which should lead to a smooth , continuum variation of the final atomic state with the velocity . in particular , the probability of the excited state after the pumping would oscillate with the velocity and therefore the final transmission after the right mirror should oscillate too , if the sequential model picture were valid .",
    "indeed , these oscillations are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] when @xmath59 ( above a low velocity threshold in which the rabi oscillations are suppressed and all channels are equally populated , for a related effect see @xcite , see also the explanation of this low velocity regime in section [ s4 ] ) .",
    "clearly , however , the oscillations are absent when @xmath53 , so the sequential , classical - like picture can not be right . in summary",
    ", the mirror potentials added to the pumping laser imply a noteworthy stabilization of the probabilities and velocity independence .",
    "the failure of the sequential scattering picture must be due to some sort of quantum interference phenomenon .",
    "interference effects are well known in scattering off composite potentials , but in comparison with , e.g. , resonance peaks in a double barrier , the present results are of a different nature .",
    "there is indeed a clean explanation to all the mysteries we have dropped along the way as the reader will find out in the next section .",
    "depending on the mirror potentials included in the device , let us label the four possible cases discussed in the previous section as follows : case `` 0 '' : @xmath59 ; case `` 1 '' : @xmath53 , @xmath58 ; case `` 2 '' : @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; case `` 12 '' : @xmath53 , @xmath56 .",

    "similarly , the cases @xmath39 and @xmath71 share the same left edge potential @xmath47 and thus a common form of @xmath66 , @xmath72 the corresponding analysis for @xmath73 gives the asymptotic forms @xmath74    the eigenvalues @xmath75 for the same parameters of fig .

    "we see that @xmath76 has at least one high barrier whereas @xmath77 .    if @xmath78 is a two - component solution of the stationary schrdinger equation , eq .",

    "because @xmath93 , an approximate solution for @xmath94 is a full transmitted wave and because @xmath95 consists of at least one `` high '' barrier -at any rate the present argument is only applicable for energies below the barrier top- , an approximate solution for @xmath94 is a wave which is fully reflected by a wall .",
