    "an hadamard matrix is a square matrix @xmath5 having its rows pairwise orthogonal .",
    "the hadamard conjecture ( hc ) , which is over a century old , states that such matrices exist , at any @xmath6 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the circulant hadamard conjecture ( chc ) , which is half a century old @xcite , states that a circulant hadamard matrix can exist only at @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , only the following matrix @xmath8 and its various `` conjugates '' can be at the same time circulant and hadamard , regardless of the size @xmath9 : @xmath10    an interesting generalization of the hadamard matrices are the complex hadamard matrices , namely the matrices @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unit circle , having their rows pairwise orthogonal .",
    "these matrices appear in several contexts , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main example is the rescaled fourier matrix ( @xmath13 ) : @xmath14    this example prevents the existence of a complex analogue of the hc .",
    "however , when trying to build complex hadamard matrices with roots of unity of a given order , a subtle generalization of the hc problematics appears @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in relation",
    "now with the chc , there has been some interesting work here on the circulant case @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , much work has gone into various geometric aspects , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "yet another generalization comes from @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the original observation from @xcite is that for an orthogonal matrix @xmath15 we have @xmath16 , with equality if and only if @xmath17 is hadamard .",
    "this follows indeed from the cauchy - schwarz inequality : @xmath18    this simple fact suggests that a natural and useful generalization of the hadamard matrices are the matrices of type @xmath17 , with @xmath15 being a maximizer of the 1-norm .",
    "however , since such matrices are quite difficult to approach , most efficient is to study first the matrices of type @xmath17 , with @xmath15 being just a local maximizer of the 1-norm .",
    "such matrices are called `` almost hadamard '' .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one key feature of the almost hadamard matrices is that at the level of examples we have a number of infinite series , uniformly depending on @xmath9 .",
    "the basic example is : @xmath19    observe that @xmath20 is circulant , and that @xmath8 is hadamard .",
    "thus we are quickly led into the circulant hadamard matrix problematics , and we have the following questions :    * problem . * _ what are the circulant hadamard matrices ? the circulant complex hadamard matrices ? the circulant almost hadamard matrices ? _",
    "more precisely , the chc states that there are exactly 8 circulant hadamard matrices , namely @xmath8 and its conjugates .",
    "regarding the second question , haagerup has shown in @xcite that for @xmath21 prime , the number of circulant complex hadamard matrices , counted with certain multiplicities , is exactly @xmath22 , and the problem is to see what happens when @xmath23 is not prime . as for the third question",
    ", this appears from our previous work @xcite .        regarding this latter question , it was shown in @xcite that we have a number of interesting examples coming from block designs @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the simplest one , coming from the adjacency matrix of the fano plane ( see the figure ) , is as follows , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 : @xmath26    now back to the above 3 questions , the point is that , from the point of view of fourier analysis , these are all related .",
    "indeed , with @xmath27 , the circulant unitary matrices are precisely those of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 belonging to the torus @xmath30 formed by the diagonal matrices over @xmath12 .",
    "so , in view of the above - mentioned remark about the 1-norm , all the above questions concern the understanding of the following potential : @xmath31 @xmath32    with this approach , the first thought goes to the computation of the moments of @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , the global maximum , or more specialized quantities such as the exact number of maxima , can be recovered via variations of the following well - known formula : @xmath34    of course , in respect to the above problems , one has to restrict sometimes attention to the torus @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , coming from the orthogonal matrices .",
    "the origins of this approach go back to @xcite , where the potential @xmath37 was investigated over the group @xmath2 , in connection with the hc .",
    "of course , the computation of moments over @xmath2 is a quite complicated question @xcite , @xcite . in the circulant case , however , the parameter space being just @xmath30",
    ", the integration problem is much simpler .",
    "but it still remains very complicated , and we have no concrete results here so far .",
    "so , instead of trying to understand the potential @xmath38 directly via its moments and analysis , we should rather try to first develop a few geometric techniques .",
    "the point is that @xmath33 has a number of symmetries , and when investigating these symmetries , the lattice @xmath39 coming from the self - adjoint matrices seems to play a key role .",
    "more precisely , we will study here the circulant and symmetric orthogonal matrices , which correspond via fourier transform to the sequences @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 .",
    "our result here , motivated by the `` almost hadamard '' problematics , is as follows :    * proposition . * _ any circulant and symmetric matrix @xmath42 is a critical point of all @xmath3-norms on @xmath2 .",
    "the local maximizers of the @xmath43-norm can be counted up to @xmath44 . _    in this statement , @xmath45 is the set of orthogonal matrices having nonzero entries . for more comments on this result",
    ", we refer to the body of the paper .    back to the general case now , one observation from @xcite is that one can replace the 1-norm by the @xmath3-norm , for any @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath47 the hlder inequality gives : @xmath48    thus for @xmath15 we have @xmath49 , with equality if and only if the rescaled matrix @xmath17 is hadamard . in the @xmath50 case a similar result holds , with the hlder inequality applying in the reverse sense , and giving the estimate @xmath51 .",
    "so , we are led to the following notion , generalizing those in @xcite , @xcite :    * definition . * _ a square matrix @xmath52 is called `` @xmath3-almost hadamard '' if the rescaled matrix @xmath1 is orthogonal , and is a local extremum of the @xmath3-norm on @xmath2 . _    here by `` local extremum '' we mean a local maximum at @xmath47 , and a local minimum at @xmath50 .",
    "also , we will call @xmath53 `` optimal '' if @xmath54 is a global maximum / minimum .",
    "one interest in this generalization comes from the exponent @xmath55 , believed to be of interest in relation with quantum physics questions .",
    "indeed , for @xmath15 we have :",
    "@xmath56    this computation shows that an orthostochastic matrix @xmath57 is `` almost flat '' , in the sense that it minimizes the hilbert - schmidt distance to the flat matrix @xmath58 , if and only if @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being a global minimizer of the @xmath61-norm on @xmath2 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .    we will prove here that the @xmath3-almost hadamard matrices can be detected by using linear algebra .",
    "we conjecture that the basic matrix @xmath20 always has this property .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in 1 - 2 we review the material in @xcite , and we discuss some new questions in the circulant case , and in 3 - 4 we perform some differential geometry computations , and we present a list of questions , that we do nt know how to solve .    *",

    "the work of i.n . was supported by the anr grant bs01 008 01 .",
    "we consider in this paper various square matrices @xmath62 .",
    "the indices of our matrices will vary in @xmath63 , and will be sometimes taken modulo @xmath23 .    as explained in the introduction",
    ", a direct application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality shows that for @xmath2 we have @xmath16 , with equality if and only @xmath17 is hadamard . in @xcite",
    "we have introduced the notion of almost hadamard matrix :    an `` almost hadamard '' matrix is a square matrix @xmath0 such that @xmath1 is orthogonal , and is a local maximum of the @xmath43-norm on @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath64 , and the matrix @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , must be positive definite",
    ".    in this statement the equivalence between the two conditions comes from a number of differential geometry computations , for which we refer to @xcite , or @xcite .    as a first remark ,",
    "any hadamard matrix is almost hadamard . in particular ,",
    "given a number @xmath67 where the hadamard conjecture holds , the hadamard matrices of order @xmath23 are precisely the almost hadamard matrices @xmath0 which are `` optimal '' , in the sense that @xmath1 is a global maximum of the 1-norm on @xmath2 .",
    "the above definition provides a useful , flexible generalization of the quite rigid class formed by the hadamard matrices .",
    "for instance at any @xmath68 we have a number of concrete examples , which can be used for various purposes .",
    "the basic example is : @xmath19    this matrix has several remarkable properties , for instance it is at the same time circulant and symmetric . also , it has at most 2 entries , which are both nonzero .",
    "so , let us look now more in detail at the matrices having similar properties .",
    "we recall from @xcite that an @xmath69 pattern is a matrix @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , such that any two rows of our matrix look as follows , up to a permutation of the columns : @xmath72    observe that the above matrix @xmath20 comes from a @xmath73 pattern .",
    "there are many other examples , the main result here being that the adjacency matrix of any @xmath74 symmetric balanced incomplete block design is an @xmath69 pattern .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the following result was proved in @xcite :    let @xmath75 be orthogonal , coming from an @xmath69 pattern .    1 .",
    "@xmath60 is a critical point of the @xmath43-norm on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath17 is almost hadamard iff @xmath76 .",
    "since any row of @xmath60 consists of @xmath77 copies of @xmath78 and @xmath79 copies of @xmath80 , we get : @xmath81    thus @xmath65 is symmetric , and by @xcite our matrix @xmath60 is a critical point of the 1-norm .",
    "regarding now the second assertion , observe first that we can write @xmath65 as follows : @xmath82    now since @xmath83 are orthogonal projections , we have @xmath84 if and only if the coefficients of these matrices are both positive , and this gives the result .",
    "let us go back now to our observation that @xmath20 is at the same time circulant and symmetric , and look in detail at the matrices having these two properties .",
    "we fix @xmath9 , and we denote by @xmath85 the fourier matrix , @xmath86 with @xmath13 . also , given a vector @xmath87 , we associate to it the diagonal matrix @xmath88 .    for a matrix @xmath89 ,",
    "the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath53 is circulant , i.e. @xmath90 , for a certain vector @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath53 is fourier - diagonal , i.e. @xmath92 , with @xmath93 diagonal .",
    "in addition , if so is the case , then with @xmath94 we have @xmath95 .",
    "this result is well - known , and the proof goes as follows :    ( 1)@xmath96(2 ) the matrix @xmath97 is indeed diagonal , given by : @xmath98    ( 2)@xmath96(1 ) the matrix @xmath92 is indeed circulant , given by : @xmath99    finally , the last assertion is clear from the above formula of @xmath100 .",
    "the following result is as well from @xcite :    a circulant matrix @xmath101 , written @xmath90 , is almost hadamard if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "the vector @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 .",
    "2 .   with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ", we have @xmath107 .    by lemma 1.3",
    "the orthogonality of @xmath60 is equivalent to the condition ( 1 ) .",
    "regarding now the condition @xmath84 , this is equivalent to @xmath108 .",
    "but : @xmath109    thus @xmath110 is circulant , with @xmath111 as first row . from lemma 1.3 again",
    "we get @xmath112 with @xmath113 and @xmath106 , so @xmath108 iff @xmath107 , and we are done . see @xcite .",
    "now , let us investigate the circulant and symmetric orthogonal matrices :    for a matrix @xmath114 , the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath60 is orthogonal , circulant and symmetric .",

    "the symmetry condition reads @xmath118 which translates into the following system of equations , with @xmath119 : @xmath120    this system admits the unique solution @xmath121 , and the result follows .    as an example",
    ", the vector @xmath122 , having length @xmath123 , produces the following @xmath124 matrix , from @xcite : @xmath125    let us reformulate now the above result in a more convenient form , and gather as well some examples . recall that the integer part of a real number @xmath126",
    "is denoted @xmath127 .",
    "there are @xmath128 circulant symmetric orthogonal @xmath124 matrices , indexed via @xmath28 by sign vectors @xmath129 , where @xmath36 .",

    "2 .   the matrix @xmath132 , coming from @xmath133 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath23 even , the matrix @xmath134 , coming from @xmath135 .",
    "4 .   for @xmath23 odd , the above matrix @xmath136 , coming from @xmath137 .    the first assertion follows from lemma 1.5 , and from the fact that the condition @xmath116 is redundant for @xmath138 for all @xmath23 , and for @xmath139 when @xmath23 is even .",
    "the vector @xmath140 generating the orthogonal matrix is then given by @xmath141 .",
    "regarding now the assertions ( 1 - 4 ) , we just have to prove here that the @xmath140-vectors in the statement produce indeed the matrices in the statement .",
    "but this is clear for ( 1 - 3 ) , and ( 4 ) follows as well , via an elementary computation performed in @xcite .    the number of orthogonal circulant symmetric matrices ( ocs ) , orthogonal circulant symmetric matrices with nonzero entries ( ocsn ) and circulant symmetric almost hadamard matrices ( ahm ) is as follows :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this follows from a computer implementation of the algorithm in proposition 1.4 , by using as input the vector @xmath129 , with @xmath36 , from proposition 1.6 .",
    "observe the arithmetic dependence of the above numbers with @xmath23 .",
    "however , this dependence is not exact , so in order to formulate an exact conjecture here , we would probably have to take into account certain algebraic geometric multiplicities , as in haagerup s paper @xcite .",
    "the only observation we can make at this point is that , for prime @xmath23 , there are only two ocs matrices with zero entries , @xmath142 .",

    "in this section we characterize the critical points of the @xmath3-norm on @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath233 are local minimizers of the @xmath3-norm , so @xmath241 for @xmath213 small , so @xmath242 for @xmath213 small . but : @xmath243    here @xmath244 is a sum of quantities of the following type , one for each pair of adjacent entries of @xmath245 , and one for each pair of adjacent entries of @xmath246 : @xmath247    the problem comes from the fact that these quantities , and hence their sum @xmath244 as well , can be positive , so that we can not conclude that we have @xmath237 .",
    "the case @xmath248 is also very problematic , because when the maximum @xmath249 appears at many places in our matrix , the rotation trick obviously can not work .",
    "in fact , there are many problems here , and the rotation trick at @xmath248 seems to require precise information about the positions of the @xmath162 and @xmath238 entries in our matrix .    of course , the fact that the rotation trick might fail at @xmath250 $ ] is not an indication that the conclusion @xmath42 should fail itself , but just of the fact that the good rotation @xmath251 might come from more complicated antisymmetric matrices @xmath252 .",
    "here is an example of such a result , excluding a few matrices having zero entries :    an antisymmetric matrix @xmath253 can not be a local extremum of the @xmath3-norm on @xmath2 , for any @xmath254 .",
    "since @xmath57 is orthogonal and antisymmetric , we have @xmath255 , and so : @xmath256    we analyze , to the first order in @xmath257 , the following function : @xmath258    at @xmath47 this function behaves like @xmath259 , so @xmath57 can not be a local maximum for the @xmath3-norm , since it is a local minimum in the direction @xmath57 . similarly , at @xmath50 the norm difference behaves like @xmath260 , so @xmath57 can not be a local minimum for the @xmath3-norm .",
    "in this section we find an algebraic criterion for detecting the @xmath3-almost hadamard matrices . for this purpose ,",
    "let us first go back to theorem 2.5 above , and introduce :      according to theorem 2.5 above , in the case where @xmath60 is a critical point of all the @xmath3-norms on @xmath2 , the matrices @xmath263 are all symmetric , and the matrices @xmath264 follow to be symmetric too .",
    "observe also that we have the following formula : @xmath265      let @xmath42 , let @xmath266 , and for @xmath252 antisymmetric , set : @xmath267 then @xmath60 is a local maximizer / minimizer of the @xmath3-norm iff @xmath268 , and the quantity @xmath269 is positive / negative , for any @xmath252 antisymmetric .",
    "since the lie algebra of @xmath270 consists of the antisymmetric matrices @xmath252 , in the neighborhood of @xmath15 we have matrices of type @xmath271 , with @xmath57 antisymmetric , and with @xmath272 close to @xmath238 .",
    "so , let us fix @xmath252 antisymmetric , and set : @xmath273                a matrix @xmath42 is a local maximizer / minimizer of the @xmath3-norm on @xmath2 , with @xmath266 , if and only if the matrix @xmath284 is symmetric , and with @xmath285 the quadratic form @xmath286 is positive / negative .",
    "let us look at the two conditions found in lemma 4.2 .",
    "the first condition , namely that we have @xmath268 for any @xmath252 antisymmetric , is equivalent to the first condition in the statement , namely that the matrix @xmath284 is symmetric .",
    "we have as well a series of questions concerning some possible extensions of this conjecture .",
    "we know from corollary 2.6 and from corollary 2.7 that both classes of matrices `` coming from designs '' and `` circulant and symmetric '' are critical points of all @xmath3-norms .",
    "we believe that the good framework is the `` circulant design '' one , and we have :        in relation with question ( 1 ) , one remark is that the fano plane matrix is indeed circulant , so the answer to the problem is certainly not trivial .",
    "question ( 2 ) looks easy but is probably not entirely trivial , because we have to exclude here for instance the identity matrix @xmath130 . as for ( 3 ) , this is definitely not trivial , among others because an answer here would probably require a serious combinatorial input , coming from ( 1 ) .",
