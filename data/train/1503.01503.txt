    "the chemical composition of stars and the interstellar medium ( ism ) reflect the evolutionary history of a galaxy from its formation to the present stage . while the physical processes leading to chemical evolution and enrichment with heavy elements such as star formation , nucleosynthesis , stellar winds , supernova explosions , galactic winds and accretion are complicated and coupled in a complex way , an intriguingly simple relationship between galactic stellar mass and the gas - phase oxygen abundance of the ism or the metallicity of the young stellar population of star forming galaxies has been observed , the mass - metallicity relationship ( mzr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that there might be a straightforward simplified way to describe the key aspects of chemical evolution .",
    "for instance , @xcite already argued that a simple closed - box chemical evolution model , where galaxies are not affected by mass accretion or mass loss and which relates metallicity to the ratio of stellar to ism gas mass , could explain the mzr of their sample of irregular galaxies well .",
    "since then it has become clear that in a @xmath2cdm dominated universe processes of galaxy merging and accretion from the intergalactic medium of the cosmic web and galactic winds may play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "consequently , the situation is far more complex than in a simple closed - box model ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , comprehensive spectroscopic surveys from low to high redshifts ( see @xcite and references therein ) clearly indicate that there is an empirical upper limit in galaxy metallicity for the most massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction to the classical closed - box model , for which the metallicity increases logarithmically with increasing ratio of stellar mass to gas mass . on the other hand ,",
    "as has been shown recently by @xcite , when allowing for galactic winds and accretion the observed mzr can still be explained by a model where the observed metallicity is a simple analytical function of the stellar to gas mass ratio .",
    "@xcite find a very similar result .",
    "they develop a new approach , in which even a closed box model would eventually reach a maximum metallicity , equal to the oxygen abundance of the supernova ejecta .",
    "they also point out that their approach should apply to spatially resolved observations .",
    "the study of global galaxy metallicity as a function of global stellar and gas mass is only a first step to constrain galaxy evolution .",
    "an important extension of these investigations , as already noted by @xcite , is to use the information of the observed resolved spatial distribution of metallicity in the disks of star forming galaxies . as is known since a long time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , disk galaxies show negative abundance gradients with increased metallicity towards the centres and lower metallicity in the outskirts . since then a considerable effort has been made to model the spatially resolved chemical evolution of galactic disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is the starting point for the study presented here . with the indication that the global metallicity of galaxies can be related to the global ratio of stellar to gas mass by relatively simple chemical evolution models @xcite",
    ", we investigate whether the spatially resolved radial distribution of metals in disk galaxies can be explained in a similar way .",
    "we use the radial distributions of stellar mass and ism hi and h@xmath3 gas mass column densities together with the observed metallicities and metallicity gradients of 20 well observed disk galaxies to find out whether the analytical chemical evolution models introduced below can explain the observed radial metallicity distribution , and whether the influence of galactic winds and accretion can be constrained in this way .",
    "this work has been triggered by the work by @xcite who investigated ifu observations of 49 local field star - forming galaxies and found a narrow gaussian distribution of metallicity gradients characterised by a mean @xmath4 standard deviation of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the _",
    "b_-band iso - photal radius ) .",
    "@xcite compared this observed distribution of metallicity gradients with that predicted by chemical evolution models from a set of stellar and gas mass profiles of 13 nearby galaxies .",
    "the latter were taken as benchmark galaxies representing local galaxies .",
    "they concluded from the comparison of the two statistical distributions that the effects of galactic winds and accretion must be very small .",
    "@xcite used a statistical approach to compare the observed distribution of metallicity gradients of their sample of ifu - studied galaxies with a model - generated sample based on the observed mass profiles of a second set of galaxies .",
    "we will apply a different approach and will investigate one single sample of galaxies with a homogeneous set of metallicity and stellar and gas mass observations .",
    "in addition , we will not only use the metallicity gradients but also the absolute level of metallicity to constrain the effects of winds and infall for each galaxy in detail .",
    "we describe the sample of local star - forming galaxies and their observations in section  [ sec : galaxy - sample - and - observations ] .",
    "the chemical evolution model is introduced in section  [ sec : the - chemical evolution - model ] and then applied in a first step in section  [ sec : the - radial - metallicity - distribution - of - the - milky - way ] to the milky way disk , where we use a fit of metallicity and metallicity gradient observed with cepheids and b - stars to empirically constrain the metallicity yield .",
    "the next step is then to apply our models for a fit of the observed gas - phase ism oxygen abundances of our star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec : analysis - of - the - observed - metallicity - distribution ] and the results are discussed and summarised in section  [ sec : discussion - and - summary ] .",
    "the sample investigated in this work consists of 19 nearby spiral galaxies selected from the study by @xcite and @xcite , who published carefully measured radial profiles of hi and h@xmath3 gas mass column densities .",
    "we combine these observations with measurements of oxygen abundances and abundance gradients published in the comprehensive study by @xcite .",
    "the study by @xcite contains 33 spirals , however , of those only 21 overlap with @xcite .",
    "of those 21 , ngc2841 and ngc4725 were not included into our final sample , because the oxygen abundance observations covered only a small radial range of the galaxies and were also very uncertain .",
    "the basic properties of our sample are summarised in table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "we note that while the majority of our sample consists of isolated field galaxies , ngc5194 ( m51 ) is a merger and ngc4625 is a pair with ngc4618 ( the latter is not included in our sample ) . for further information see @xcite and @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the term `` sl - sample '' for this sample of 19 spiral galaxies .",
    "we include the milky way as the 20th galaxy in our investigation .",
    "we will use the milky way as test galaxy for the chemical evolution models and for the empirical calibration of our yields .",

    "the method is based on the application of an analytical chemical evolution model , which assumes constant ratios of galactic mass - loss and mass - gain to the star formation rate and which then predicts radial metallicity profiles as a function of the ratio of stellar mass to ism gas mass .",
    "generally , this relatively simple model reproduces the observed metallicies and their radial gradients very well . in some cases",
    ", however , the model fails at outer galactocentric distances mostly for galaxies with extended disks of high hi gas column densities , but it still remains useful in the inner parts .",
    "we have applied the model to the observations of the milky way disk and empirically determined the metallicity yield @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath52 is the fraction of stellar mass returned to the ism and has been adopted as r = 0.4 in our model calculation ( other values of @xmath52 were also tested but the influence of varying @xmath52 was found to be small ) . using a b - star mass fraction of oxygen to total metallicy @xmath53 , we determined an oxygen yield of @xmath54 = 0.00313 . with a galactic wind mass - loading factor @xmath55 and a very low accretion gain @xmath56 , the model reproduces the observed metallicity gradient very accurately .",
    "we conclude that based on our model fit the milky way disk is characterised by a low accretion rate and a moderate galactic wind mass loading factor .",
    "we note , however , that this result is in disagreement with the estimate of the milky way infall rate from ultraviolet absorption line studies of halo high velocity clouds in the sightline of halo stars from which @xcite estimate an infall rate of 0.8 to 1.4  @xmath13  yr@xmath57 . with a milky way star formation rate of @xmath58  @xmath13  yr@xmath57 @xcite ,",
    "this would lead to a value of @xmath2 between 0.35 to 0.93 much larger than our very good fit indicates .",
    "however , we also note that @xcite do not rule out star formation rates a factor of two higher for alternative choices of the initial mass function and that the determination of the infall rate depends on a variety of parameters which are not well constrained as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we also tested the alternative chemical evolution models developed recently by @xcite to reproduce the observed global metallicities of galaxies by the use of the global galaxy gas and stellar mass .",
    "while this model has been successfully applied to explain the observed global mass - metallicity relationship of galaxies , it fails in the spatially resolved case of the milky way to reproduce the observed metallicity gradient .    about @xmath59 of our sample of galaxies studied showed similarly low values of accretion rates @xmath2 as the milky way disk with simultaneously a range of mass loading factors between @xmath60 .",

    "our results do not confirm the observational finding by @xcite based on an investigation of global metallicities , masses and star formation rates that galaxies evolve along the `` equilibrium relationship '' @xmath2 = @xmath40 + ( 1-r ) by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that @xcite applied the same chemical evolution model as this study ; however , an important difference is that in our investigation the spatially resolved information about metallicity , gas and stellar masses is used and the gas mass profiles are obtained directly from radio observations , whereas in @xcite the information about gas masses is obtained indirectly from the kennicutt - schmidt law and h@xmath69 observations . in addition , @xcite do not disentangle the effects of galactic bulges by a bulge decomposition of the stellar mass profiles .",

    "<S> the radially averaged metallicity distribution of the ism and the young stellar population of a sample of 20 disk galaxies is investigated by means of an analytical chemical evolution model which assumes constant ratios of galactic wind mass loss and accretion mass gain to star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> based on this model the observed metallicities and their gradients can be described surprisingly well by the radially averaged distribution of the ratio of stellar mass to ism gas mass . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between observed and model predicted metallicity is used to constrain the rate of mass loss through galactic wind and accretion gain in units of the star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> three groups of galaxies are found : galaxies with either mostly winds and only weak accretion , or mostly accretion and only weak winds , and galaxies where winds are roughly balanced by accretion . </S>",
    "<S> the three groups are distinct in the properties of their gas disks . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with approximately equal rates of mass - loss and accretion gain have low metallicity , atomic hydrogen dominated gas disks with a flat spatial profile . </S>",
    "<S> the other two groups have gas disks dominated by molecular hydrogen out to 0.5 to 0.7 isophotal radii and show a radial exponential decline , which is on average steeper for the galaxies with small accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of accretion ( @xmath0 ) and outflow ( @xmath1 ) are relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> the latter depend on the calibration of the zero point of the metallicity determination from the use of hii region strong emission lines .    </S>",
