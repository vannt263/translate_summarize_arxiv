    "the idea of combining mathematics with physics in order to describe the enclosing world comes from the ancient greeks with the pioneering works of archimedes , which can be found in his recently discovered palimpsest . since then , from the first simple models by ptolemy and copernicus , the laws of the universe have been successfully described by more and more complicated mathematical structures .",
    "the crowning achievement of these efforts are the theories of general relativity and the ( quantum ) standard model of particle physics .",
    "the first one describes the behaviour of the universe at large scales and is based on the differential geometry developed by riemann .",
    "the second one describes the fundamental particles of the universe and their interactions at short scales , using the algebraic techniques of gauge theories .",
    "an ultimate model , which is still out of sight , would combine aspects of both large and short scales , describing at the same time gravitation and the other interactions . in order to reach this goal ,",
    "mathematicians and physicists need to associate with each other and propose novel physical models based on sophisticated mathematical structures .",
    "the theory of noncommutative geometry , initially introduced by connes @xcite , is one of the new theories that provides an interesting mathematical background suitable for physical models , especially concerning the problem of unifying fundamental interactions . in this framework one",
    "uses a strong relation ( equivalence of suitable categories ) between geometry and algebra in order to translate the usual riemannian geometry to the formalism of commutative @xmath0-algebras .",
    "next , the geometric concepts are extended to general noncommutative @xmath0-algebras , hence the name of _ noncommutative geometry_. in this formalism one can formulate the _ noncommutative standard model _  the classical standard model of particles coupled to euclidean gravity @xcite .    while the noncommutative standard model already yields several interesting predictions in particle physics , the gravitational part of this model  the part of noncommutative geometry which corresponds to the usual riemannian geometry  has mainly been developed using euclidean signature , with no distinction between the time and spatial coordinates . as a consequence ,",
    "the typical lorentzian aspects of space - time coming from the differences between timelike and spacelike directions are lost in the current model .",
    "the development of _ lorentzian noncommutative geometry _ ",
    "a lorentzian counterpart of connes theory incorporating the specificities of lorentzian signature  is very recent and far from being complete .",
    "we shall present in this expository article the basic ingredients of lorentzian noncommutative geometry along with our latest results .",
    "in particular , we will focus on how to define the causal structure of a , possibly noncommutative , space - time .",
    "we will show that in the almost commutative setting , causality plays an important role in the coupling between the classical space - time and the internal noncommutative space .",
    "geometry is probably the most useful mathematical concept in the construction of physical models .",
    "typically , one uses at first a topological space ( hausdorff space , manifold ) , chooses an additional structure on it ( differential structure , metric tensor , symplectic form ,  ) and then tries to set some principles describing the dynamics ( equations of motion , lagrangian , hamiltonian ,  ) .",
    "the construction of noncommutative geometry follows the same three steps , whose respective names could be :    * gelfand - naimark duality ; * spectral triples ; * spectral action .",
    "the powerfulness of noncommutative geometry consists in the fact that in the first step one enlarges the set of topological spaces to some ` noncommutative spaces ' , which allow only a global , algebraic description .",
    "the next two steps are just an attempt to extend the usual structures and dynamical principles from classical geometric spaces to the new constructs . as a result ,",

    "if the manifold is acausal ( as for example a compact lorentzian manifold without boundary ) , such a condition can not be fulfilled .",

    "a proposal for such a structure suitable for the construction of a noncommutative lorentzian distance formula is presented in @xcite .",
    "as an illustration of the previous section we shall present a toy model of an almost commutative manifold on which the notion of causality can easily be explored .",

    "the latter can be understood as a global rotation of the space of states and thus does not affect the causal structure .",
    "the almost commutative spectral triple is constructed using the product with the fundamental symmetry given by @xmath223 .",

    "at first we need to describe the space @xmath184 .",
    "since the algebra @xmath226 is commutative , all of the pure states are _ separable _ and we have @xmath229 .",
    "moreover , it is known @xcite that @xmath230 , so the space of pure states ( with the topology ) is homeomorphic to the cartesian product @xmath231 .",
    "let us stress however that the @xmath232 component is a only topological sphere and its metric aspect is governed by the noncommutative geometry described by the spectral triple @xmath63 .",

    "we note that if two pure states @xmath246 and @xmath247 have the same latitude , they can always be written as @xmath248 and @xmath249 with @xmath250 , so @xmath251 and @xmath252 represent the position of the vectors on the parallel of latitude .    by applying definition [ defncauscone ] to the almost commutative space - time described above",
    "we obtain the following result :    [ thmcausal ] two pure states @xmath253 are causally related with @xmath254 if and only if the following conditions are respected :    * @xmath255 in @xmath211 ; * @xmath246 and @xmath247 have the same latitude ; * @xmath256 , where @xmath257 represents the length of a  causal curve @xmath37 going from @xmath203 to @xmath204 on  @xmath211 .",
    "this theorem has various interesting implications concerning the causal relations in the almost commutative space - time :    * first of all , the usual causal relations in the space - time are preserved .",
    "this implies that the coupling with the internal space does not involve any causality violation . *",
    "secondly , the motion within the internal space is only possible on a parallel of latitude , i.e.  no information can be transmitted from one parallel of latitude to another . as a consequence ,",
    "no movement in the internal space is possible at the poles ( note that the position of the poles and the parallels of latitude are actually determined by a unitary transformation diagonalising the finite dirac operator ) . even if such a restriction seems rather surprising",
    ", it is in fact completely coherent with a result in @xcite where it is shown , using the riemannian distance formula , that different parallels of latitude of @xmath258 are separated by an infinite distance . *",
    "the last condition of theorem [ thmcausal ] implies the existence of a strong relation between the space - time and the internal space .",
    "indeed , the possible motion along a parallel of latitude are correlated with the length @xmath259 , which physically represents the proper time of a signal moving along the curve @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath260 , the constraint can also be understood as : @xmath261 this means that there exists an upper bound on the speed within the internal space which only depends on the values of the finite dirac operator @xmath262 .",
    "such a constraint implies that the ratio between the distance travelled along the parallel of latitude and the time spent on the space - time can not go beyond a fixed limit .",
    "let us take a closer look at the geometry of the almost commutative space - time considered above .",
    "we stressed at the beginning of this section that the correspondence @xmath263 is purely topological and does not take into account the metric aspect .",
    "in fact , as connes formula may take an infinite value ( it is a pseudo - distance rather than a distance ) , it may affect also the topology .",
    "therefore , we should rather write @xmath264 } s^1 $ ] .",
    "let us now fix a parallel of latitude on @xmath232 and consider the following product manifold @xmath265 endowed with the metric @xmath266 .",
    "if we consider a curve @xmath267 where @xmath37 is a curve on @xmath211 going from @xmath203 to @xmath204 and @xmath268 is a curve on @xmath269 going from @xmath251 to @xmath252 , then @xmath270 is causal if and only if @xmath37 is causal on @xmath211 and @xmath271 , which gives the same condition as in theorem [ thmcausal ] .",
    "the geometric picture that emerges is the following : for a finite spectral triple @xmath272 , the space of pure states @xmath258 equipped with connes pseudo - distance can be written as a disjoint sum of metric spaces .",
    "let us stress that the final object depends on the exact form of @xmath262 .",
    "for instance , if one would take @xmath262 with @xmath273 in the above model , one would discover that all of the points in @xmath232 would be separated by an infinite distance ( see @xcite for details ) . in the almost commutative product",
    "the resulting physical space of states is just a cartesian product of a manifold and @xmath258 with a simple coupling of the metrics .",
    "our results show that if the manifold is chosen to be a globally hyperbolic one , this picture remains true .",
    "we have demonstrated it on a toy model , but we conjecture that the described situation is general .",
    "in this paper we have presented mathematically rigorous results on the extension of the causal structure to noncommutative geometry .",
    "surprisingly enough , even for a simple , almost commutative toy model , the causal relations turned out to be more robust then the classical ones .",
    "however , one might ask whether the obtained mathematical structure indeed describes an aspect of the universe ?",
    "one should be aware of conceptual problems lurking in every unification theory such as noncommutative geometry . from the mathematically sophisticated theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics",
    "we have learned that one should be ready to abandon one s intuitions and prejudices about such notions as time or observable .",
    "indeed , we have seen that when spaces become noncommutative , the notion of a point ",
    "fundamental from the point of view of physical idealisations",
    " becomes much harder to grasp .",
    "therefore , one should ask : what does causality really mean when geometry becomes noncommutative ?",
    "our understanding is that it puts constraints on the evolution of a physical system described via its states . by extending the basic einstein s postulate that no physical signal can exceed the speed of light",
    ", we claim that no physical process can lead to an evolution in the space of states that violates the conditions imposed by the generalised causal structure .",
    "this interpretation may lead to strong physical predictions as it indicates which processes are excluded and which are allowed .",
    "these on the other hand can be explicitly tested in a suitable real - world experiment .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the almost commutative geometry is utilised to model fundamental interactions at a classical ( not quantum ) level and this is the domain in which one should seek potential physical consequences of generalised causal relations . if one chooses the algebra @xmath67 one obtains @xmath274 .",
    "although the model at hand is classical it is legitimate to regard @xmath275 as the space of the corresponding quantum system @xcite . in this spirit",
    ", @xmath275 can be given the following interpretation :    * the points @xmath276 and @xmath277 correspond to electroweak singlets ",
    "right - handed electron and right - handed neutrino respectively . *",
    "the @xmath232 component encompasses the electroweak doublet consisting of left - handed electron and a left - handed neutrino . *",
    "@xmath278 part encodes the strong quark triplet .",
    "note that indeed the strong interactions do not distinguish between right- and left - handed particles .",
    "let us also mention that the second @xmath279 summand in @xmath280 allows for massive neutrinos , which implies the existence of a right - handed neutrino @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact the @xmath281 adds a new single point to @xmath275 .    by sticking to the particle - physics interpretation of the considered toy model we could give a free rein to our imagination and try to venture some possible physical consequences .",
    "the first feature that appears to be general is that if one moves in the space - time with the speed of light then no change at all is allowed in the internal space .",
    "this is because the proper time along the lightlike curve is constant and equal to 0 at each moment of the evolution .",
    "one might thus speculate that any particle which is able to interact with others via a non - gravitational force must have a non - zero mass , so that it travels at a speed smaller than the speed of light .",
    "in particular , it would imply that neutrinos in _ all _ generations are massive , since the space of states description does not distinguish between the generations .",
    "let us stress that current experiments on neutrino oscillations imply that at least two of the neutrinos should have non - zero masses .",
    "the same reasoning might be applied to some ncg - based dark matter models ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "secondly , it is natural to suspect that whenever that riemannian distance between two states of the system is infinite , no causal relation between them can take place .",
    "this might potentially have deep physical consequences concerning the evolution of one state into another .",
    "however , to understand this aspect one would need to introduce gauge bosons , which are described by the fluctuations of the dirac operator ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.5 ) . it might change the picture as for instance the introduction of the higgs field renders finite the distance between the two copies of space - time in the two - sheeted model @xcite .    to draw concrete physical conclusions",
    ", one should enrich several aspects of the described toy model :    1 .",
    "the base manifold should be a 4-dimensional , possibly curved , globally hyperbolic space - time . in our opinion",
    "this is only a technical issue and should not induce essentially new physical effects . 2 .",
    "the finite algebra should be extended to the full standard model algebra @xmath282 .",
    "this step should be performed with care , as working directly with @xmath282 seems to be too involved at the present stage . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we will describe the causal structure of a two - sheeted model based on a finite algebra @xmath283 with a non - diagonal dirac operator @xmath262 .",
    "3 .   the impact of the fluctuations of the dirac operator on the causal structure needs to be studied .",
    "as mentioned , this operation may change the causal relations between the states rather drastically .",
    "we are of course aware that the above interpretations are highly speculative and a lot of hard mathematical work needs to be done before one would be entitled to draw any conclusions about the structure of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the almost commutative models seem to be interesting from the point of view of physics as they might lead to testable predictions .",
    "we should also note , that there is another approach to causality in the noncommutative regime which leads to rather different , though no less intriguing , effects @xcite .",
    "finally , let us make a disclaimer about our choice of considering states as a generalisation of space - time events .",
    "our attitude is based on the conviction that the notion of a point in noncommutative geometry simply does not make sense .",
    "the fact that the use of states or maximal ideals or irreducible representation does not necessarily lead to the same structure just means that the noncommutative geometry is more robust than the commutative one and therefore it carries more information .    to conclude this essay ,",
    "let us make an outlook towards other possible directions of development of the lorentzian noncommutative geometry .",
    "first of all one should agree on the actual definition of a lorentzian spectral triple . to this end , one would need to establish a reconstruction theorem allowing to identify the exact class of lorentzian spectral triples corresponding to lorentzian manifolds , or at least to globally hyperbolic space - times .",
    "an extension of connes reconstruction theorem to pseudo - riemannian or lorentzian manifolds , which is deep in the shadows at this moment , is a hope for the future .",
    "the second significant drawback of lorentzian noncommutative geometry is that only two out of three steps needed in order to set a physical model ( the topology and the differential structure ) are partially fulfilled .",
    "the question of the dynamics is still completely open .",
    "the usual tools to compute the spectral action in the riemannian setting are not valid , because of the vicious properties of the lorentzian dirac operator .",
    "it is not even known whether the problem only requires new techniques or whether one should modify the very paradigm of the spectral action principle .",
    "this is probably the biggest challenge for the future of lorentzian noncommutative geometry .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the john templeton foundation .",
