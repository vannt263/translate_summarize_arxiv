    "the generally accepted scenario of neutron star ( ns ) glitches , proposed by @xcite , assumes that sudden unpinning of a group of vortices from their pinning centers results in an abrupt increase of the observed ns rotation frequency  a glitch . here",
    "we present a toy model which demonstrates that , under certain conditions ( in particular , for not too high neutron critical temperature in the outer core , see sections [ sec : phys ] and [ sec : results ] for details ) , an opposite effect  anti - glitch  can take place due to avalanche - like unpinning of vortices .",
    "our model takes into account that superfluid density depends on the relative velocities between the normal and superfluid ns components ( hereafter the @xmath0-effect ; see section [ sec : deltav ] ) . when a group of vortices leaves the superfluid region , the velocity lag between the normal component and pinned superfluid component decreases and , due to the @xmath0-effect , the mass of the superfluid fraction increases .",
    "such a redistribution of mass between the normal and superfluid liquid components , which has been ignored so far , can naturally lead to an anti - glitch for certain model parameters .",
    "although there are a number of models describing anti - glitches ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the proposed effect allows one to explain the ` sudden ' spin down of the magnetar 1e2259 + 586 ( @xcite ) within the generally accepted scenario of ns glitches .",
    "here we introduce the notion of superfluid density @xmath1 and discuss how it can be affected by the relative motion of superfluid and normal currents induced in the system ( see below for the definition of superfuid and normal currents ) . below we set @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider a non - relativistic degenerate fermi - liquid composed of identical particles .",
    "assume that at a temperature @xmath3 less than some critical temperature @xmath4 they start to form cooper pairs ( become superfluid ) .",
    "in what follows , we , for simplicity , assume that the particles pair in the spin - singlet @xmath5s@xmath6 state and ignore the fermi - liquid effects ( in particular , we assume that the particle effective mass coincides with its bare mass @xmath7 ) .    generally , at @xmath8 it is instructive to think of the superfluid liquid as consisting of two components , the superfluid and normal ones .",
    "the superfluid component , which has a density @xmath9 , is associated with the cooper - pair condensate , while the normal component with the density @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the total liquid density ) is associated with the thermal ( bogoliubov ) excitations ( unpaired particles ) .",
    "a notable property of any superfluid system is that these components can flow , without friction , with two distinct velocities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a consequence , the total mass - current density @xmath12 ( or the momentum density @xmath13 ) of the liquid can be presented as a sum of two terms , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the velocities of the superfluid and normal components , respectively .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath15 is related to the momentum @xmath17 of a cooper pair by the expression @xmath18 . in the reference frame",
    "in which @xmath19 , we have ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath20 where the summation goes over the fermi momenta @xmath21 and spin states @xmath22 of the bogoliubov thermal excitations ; @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the fermi - dirac distribution function for thermal excitations ; @xmath25 is their energy in the reference frame in which @xmath19 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the particle s fermi momentum and fermi velocity , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath28 is the superfluid energy gap , which generally depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that sufficiently large @xmath0 can affect the gap was emphasized by @xcite ( see also @xcite , where this effect was discussed in application to nss ) . in the absence of currents ( @xmath31 ) gap can be approximated as ( @xcite ) @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and decreases from the value @xmath34 at @xmath35 to 0 at @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath0 at @xmath35 is similar : it decreases from @xmath37 at @xmath38 to 0 at @xmath39 ( see @xcite for details ) . in an arbitrary frame equation ( [ pj ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath40 equations ( [ j ] ) and ( [ pj2 ] ) allow us to find expression for the normal density @xmath41 and hence for the superfluid density @xmath42 , @xmath43 as follows from this formula , @xmath41 and @xmath1 not only depend on @xmath3 but also on @xmath0 ( this is the @xmath0-effect announced in the beginning of the section ) ; the latter dependence is especially pronounced at @xmath44 .",
    "usually , however , one considers a situation in which @xmath45 .",
    "then two simplifications can be made .",
    "first , one can neglect the dependence of the gap on @xmath0 , @xmath46 ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , one can expand the function @xmath47 in equation ( [ rhoq ] ) in taylor series , retaining only the term linear in @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath41 reduces then to the standard one ( e.g. , @xcite ) and is independent of @xmath0 , @xmath49 as it will be clear from the subsequent consideration , the condition @xmath50 is not necessarily satisfied in nss .",
    "hence in what follows we will make use of the more general formula ( [ rhoq ] ) rather than the standard equation ( [ rhoq2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : frac ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath0 for seven stellar temperatures : @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . at @xmath53 , when @xmath0 is small , all particles are paired and @xmath54 .",
    "as the velocity lag @xmath0 becomes larger , the superfluid fraction decreases and eventually disappears ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath56 .     in units of the total density @xmath11 as a function of the velocity lag @xmath0 normalized to @xmath57 for seven stellar temperatures . ]",
    "the standard glitch scenario teaches us that when the crust slows down , pinned superfluid stays rotating with a higher frequency @xmath58 , because vortices , which determine @xmath58 , can not freely escape from the pinning region .",
    "( note that by the ` crust ' we understand not only the solid crust itself but also all the ns components rigidly coupled to it .",
    "they include non - superfluid and charged particles , neutron thermal bogoliubov excitations , as well as unpinned superfluid neutron component . ) at some moment a group of vortices unpins ( the actual unpinning mechanism is unknown but is not important for us here ) and transfers angular momentum to the crust . in the standard scenario this event leads to decrease of @xmath58 and , due to angular momentum conservation , to increase of @xmath59 .",
    "however , the standard consideration ignores the @xmath0-effect . how will @xmath59 change if we account for it ?",
    "the answer follows from the angular momentum conservation , @xmath60 where the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath62 refer to the corresponding quantities before and after the glitch , respectively . in equation ( [ 0 ] )",
    "@xmath63 is the moment of inertia of the pinned superfluid component ; @xmath64 is the moment of inertia of the remaining components ; @xmath65 is the total stellar moment of inertia . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath63",
    "is given by the integral over the pinning region , @xmath66 and depends on the rotation lag @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the neutron superfluid density ; @xmath68 is the radial coordinate , @xmath69 is the polar angle , and @xmath70 is the volume element .    taking into account that the variation @xmath71 of the rotations lag in the glitch event is much smaller than @xmath72 , one can expand @xmath73 and @xmath74 in taylor series near the point @xmath75 and rewrite equation ( [ 0 ] ) in the form @xmath76 ( \\omega_{c0}+\\delta \\omega_{c})+\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ i_{s0}+i_{s } ' ( \\delta \\omega_{s}-\\delta \\omega_{c } ) ] ( \\omega_{s0}+\\delta \\omega_{s } ) , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 ; @xmath78 and @xmath79 . equation ( [ 1 ] ) yields @xmath80 this formula reduces to the standard result , @xmath81 , if one sets @xmath82 .",
    "because @xmath83 ( superfluid density @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath67 ) , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , it follows from equation ( [ main ] ) that we shall observe an abrupt pulsar spin down ( an anti - glitch ; @xmath86 ) if @xmath87 or , equivalently , @xmath88 thus , when anti - glitch occurs both the pinned superfluid and the rest of the star decelerate ( @xmath89 ) , while the moment of inertia redistributes ( via formation of additional cooper pairs ) to satisfy the angular momentum conservation .",
    "as follows from equation ( [ cond ] ) , for anti - glitch to occur it is necessary to have a relatively large @xmath90 .",
    "in other words , the superfluid neutron density @xmath91 in the pinning region should be quite sensitive to a variation of @xmath67 [ see equation ( [ is ] ) ] . as discussed in section 2 , for",
    "that it is necessary to have @xmath44 or @xmath92 [ here and below the quantities @xmath26 , @xmath93 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 etc .",
    "refer to neutrons ] . from this estimate one",
    "obtains a typical value @xmath94 of the rotation lag @xmath67 , at which one can expect to have an anti - glitch , @xmath95   \\left ( \\frac{n_0}{n } \\right)^{1/3 }   \\left ( \\frac{10 ^ 6 \\ , { \\rm cm}}{r } \\right ) \\,\\,\\ , { \\rm rad } \\,\\ , { \\rm s}^{-1 } , \\label{typ}\\ ] ] where @xmath96  @xmath97 is the nucleon number density in atomic nuclei ; @xmath98 is the neutron number density .",
    "generally , @xmath94 increases with @xmath99 ( see equation [ gap0 ] )",
    ".    the condition ( [ typ ] ) can hardly be satisfied in the crust , because @xmath4 there is larger than @xmath100  k everywhere except for the narrow regions at the slopes of the neutron critical temperature profile @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath94 are much higher than possible frequency lags sustained by the vortex pinning ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but this condition is very likely to be met in the core .",
    "recently @xcite has demonstrated that entrainment in the crust can be strong . if correct , this result indicates that the crust is probably not enough to explain pulsar glitches so that the core superfluid may be responsible for glitches as well ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally accepted ( e.g. , @xcite ) that protons in the core form type ii superconductor which harbors magnetic field confined to flux tubes ( for a discussion of other possibilities see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "neutron vortices pin to magnetic flux tubes in the same way as they pin to nuclei in the crust .",
    "purely poloidal configuration of the magnetic field can not immobilize vortices so that they freely escape from the core as ns slows down . on the opposite",
    ", toroidal component efficiently prevents vortices from moving outwards ( @xcite ) .",
    "a number of numerical simulations in non - superfluid nss ( @xcite ) and in superconducting nss ( @xcite ) show that toroidal component of the magnetic field , localized in outer layers of the ns core , is necessary for stability of the magnetic field configuration .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that toroidal field , which can be noticeably higher than the surface magnetic field , is confined within the equatorial belt of the width @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is the stellar radius ) at a distance @xmath104 from the center ( @xcite ) . for definiteness , in our numerical calculations",
    "we assume that the pinning region , which coincides with the localization region of the toroidal field , has the form of a torus with coordinates @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 $ ] , @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the moment of inertia pinned to such a region is about @xmath109 for @xmath110 and @xmath35 ( see figure [ fig : is ] and a similar estimate of @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation lag @xmath72 , at which glitch / anti - glitch occurs , is uncertain .",
    "clearly , it can not exceed the maximum value of the critical lag @xmath111 in the pinning region , required to unpin vortices from flux tubes by the magnus force .",
    "a typical energy of vortex pinning to flux tubes is of the order of @xmath112 [ see @xcite and formula ( a13 ) of @xcite ] .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath113 ( a more refined estimate can be found in @xcite ) . in case of magnetars",
    "we obtain @xmath114 for the magnetic field in the core @xmath115  g. below @xmath72 will be treated as a free parameter of our toy model .",
    "( in units of @xmath65 ) versus rotation lag , @xmath72 , for four values of the stellar temperature .",
    "for each temperature filled circle indicates a minimum value of @xmath72 required to transform a glitch to an anti - glitch . at smaller @xmath72 ( thin lines )",
    "we observe glitches , at higher @xmath72 ( thick lines )  anti - glitches . ]",
    "0.15 cm    the value of @xmath116 in the core is also uncertain and varies from @xmath117  k ( @xcite ) to @xmath118  k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that , to calculate the gap the latter authors used bare neutron - neutron interactions and ignored medium polarization effects , which can substantially overestimate @xmath116 ( @xcite ) . for illustration , in our calculations",
    "we choose @xmath119 in the pinning region ( @xmath99 in the inner core can be larger ) .",
    "this value does not contradict the results of microscopic calculations and , e.g. , is close to @xmath116 reported by @xcite .",
    "it also agrees with the predictions of minimal cooling scenario ( see , e.g. , model a2 in figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "using input parameters from section 4 , we analyzed whether anti - glitches are possible if we allow for the @xmath0-effect .",
    "our results are shown in figures [ fig : is ] and [ fig : domega ] . to plot the figures we employed apr equation of state ( @xcite ) and considered a ns with the mass @xmath120 .",
    "figure [ fig : is ] presents the normalized moment of inertia of the pinned superfluid @xmath121 , calculated with equation ( [ is ] ) , as a function of the rotation lag , @xmath122 . the function @xmath123 is plotted for four typical ( @xcite ) values of magnetar temperature , @xmath124 ( black lines online ) , @xmath125 ( red lines online ) , @xmath126 ( blue lines online ) , and @xmath127 ( magenta lines online ) . at",
    "small rotation lags @xmath128 is too small to meet the condition ( [ cond ] ) ( see thin lines in the figure ) , but it increases with @xmath72 .",
    "then , at some value of @xmath72 ( marked with filled circles ) @xmath129 and @xmath121 become equal to one another and at higher @xmath72 the inequality ( [ cond ] ) is always hold ( then a vortex avalanche leads to an anti - glitch ; thick lines in the figure ) .    figure [ fig : domega ] presents the ratio @xmath130 [ see equation ( [ main ] ) ] versus @xmath72 .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath131 is the observed rotation frequency jump , while @xmath132 is the frequency jump of the pinned superfluid component . in the standard glitch scenario",
    "@xmath133 is negative and depends on the number of unpinned vortices and on the place in the star where they repin .",
    "it is thus a poorly constrained parameter .    .",
    "dashed lines are calculated ignoring the @xmath0-effect .",
    "an anti - glitch corresponds to @xmath134 ( unshaded region ) .",
    "other notations are the same as in figure [ fig : is ] . ]",
    "0.2 cm    the curves are plotted for the same set of temperatures as in figure [ fig : is ] .",
    "when @xmath72 is small the @xmath0-effect is negligible and solid lines almost coincide with the corresponding dashed lines , which are calculated ignoring this effect . as @xmath72 increases",
    ", @xmath130 also increases and eventually reaches 0 ( this moment is shown by filled circles in the figure ) . at larger rotation lags",
    "@xmath131 becomes negative ( @xmath130 is positive ) ; then vortex avalanche leads to an anti - glitch , which generally has a similar size @xmath135 as glitches at the same @xmath132 .",
    "note that , for higher temperatures @xmath93 is smaller and a lower rotation lag is required to produce an anti - glitch [ see estimate ( [ typ ] ) ] .",
    "further increase of @xmath72 leads to a gradual shrinking of the pinning region ( due to transformation of the superfluid matter to normal matter with growing @xmath72 ) .",
    "this leads to a rapid decrease of @xmath128 ( see figure [ fig : is ] ) and hence to a sharp decrease of @xmath130 .",
    "finally , when the superfluidity is completely destroyed in the whole pinning region , neither glitches nor anti - glitches are possible ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "as follows from figure [ fig : domega ] , anti - glitches can be produced for @xmath137  rad  s@xmath138 , in agreement with the estimate ( [ typ ] ) .",
    "such values of @xmath72 are comparable to the critical rotation lag @xmath111 , estimated in section 4 ( recall that @xmath72 can not exceed @xmath111 ) .",
    "thus , the standard glitch scenario can account for anti - glitches .",
    "note , however , that this conclusion is sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath99 in the pinning region .",
    "for example , for @xmath139  k ( e.g. , @xcite ) one has @xmath140  rad s@xmath138 ; for such @xmath99 anti - glitches will hardly occur in our model unless @xmath111 is substantially larger for some reason .",
    "here we propose a toy model that allows us to describe an anti - glitch within the standard scenario of pulsar glitches formulated by @xcite .",
    "the main feature of our model is account for the so - called @xmath0-effect  the dependence of the superfluid density on the relative velocity of normal and superfluid components ( see section [ sec : deltav ] ) .",
    "we predict that magnetars are the most promising anti - glitching objects .",
    "high magnetic field of magnetars provides strong pinning of vortices to flux tubes in the outer core , which leads to a large rotation lag between the normal and superfluid components .",
    "as we showed , such a rotation lag may be sufficient to transform a glitch to an anti - glitch .",
    "could similar mechanism produce anti - glitches in the _ crust _ of a magnetar or an ordinary pulsar ?",
    "most probably not , because the critical rotation lag @xmath111 ( see section 4 ) seems to be noticeably smaller ( @xcite ) than the typical rotation lag @xmath94 [ see equation ( [ typ ] ) ] , which is needed to affect @xmath1 .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , the pinning force per unit length is weaker for pinning to crust nuclei than for pinning to flux tubes in the core of a magnetar .",
    "second , the rotation lag ( @xmath141 ) , that can lead to an anti - glitch in the crust , is severalfold larger than in the core , because the neutron critical temperature @xmath4 in the crust is higher . due to these two factors",
    "it seems implausible that vortex avalanches in the crust can lead to a substantial redistribution of the stellar moment of inertia and thus to an anti - glitch .",
    "however , if , due to some reason , vortex unpinning occurs exclusively in the narrow region where @xmath4 is substantially lower ( i.e. , on the slopes of the critical temperature profile ) , then anti - glitches could , in principle , be produced .",
    "we summarize by concluding that : ( @xmath142 ) the same magnetar can exhibit both glitches ( due to vortex unpinning in the crust ) and , under certain conditions , anti - glitches ( due to vortex unpinning in the core ) and ( @xmath143 ) it is not very likely that ordinary pulsars can demonstrate any anti - glitching activity .",
    "this is an extended version of the contribution presented at the conference `` physics of neutron stars  2014 '' ( july 28  august 1 , 2014 , st .- petersburg , russia ) .",
