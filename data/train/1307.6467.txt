    "rotational motion is well defined in classical physics where an inert structure is rotating as a rigid body around its center of mass .",
    "the two integrals of motion , energy and angular momentum , are continuous quantities in classical physics . in quantum physics",
    "the angular momentum is always quantized by integer or half integer quantum numbers , and the energy assumes discrete and continuous values for bound and unbound states , respectively . furthermore , to exhibit rotational motion quantum systems must have an intrinsic state deviating from total spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "the signature of rotating quantum systems is a sequence of excited states with energies following the @xmath7-rule where @xmath8 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "however , this necessary condition is not sufficient as the underlying wave functions for different @xmath8 simultaneously must describe the same rotating structure .",
    "the ratio of electromagnetic transition probabilities from one of these states to another are observables given by simple geometric factors depending only on the angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "thus a rotational band is defined as the sequence of states arising from quantization of the rotational motion of an ( almost ) frozen deformed structure @xcite .",
    "the concept of quantum mechanical rotational motion then relies on discrete quantum states each described by a wave function .",
    "rotational states are abundant in molecules and nuclei . in molecules",
    "numerous rotational states are present @xcite",
    ". they extent to both high angular momenta and relatively high excitation energies .",
    "the highly excited molecular resonant states in e.g. the @xmath9 mg nucleus represent interesting combinations of molecular structures found in nuclei @xcite .",
    "these quasimolecular structures were already observed in the early 60 s in @xmath10c+@xmath10c elastic scattering reactions @xcite .",
    "they are in general very well defined even in the continuum where they can decay through non - electromagnetic channels , i.e. either by a non - adiabatic molecular process or by electron emission through a tunneling process .",
    "the coupling to vibrational states is usually responsible for photon emission @xcite , as e.g. the @xmath11 transitions discussed in the present paper . in nuclear physics it has been customary to treat excited states as bound states even when it is well known that they are embedded in a continuum of states @xcite .",
    "this includes the many cases where spontaneous decays are measured @xcite , and a width thereby attached to these resonances @xcite .",
    "such approximations are usually very well justified , first of all in experimental investigations where pronounced and narrow peaks are detected .",
    "a measured width is a mixture of intrinsic lifetime , reaction or decay times and detector resolution , but often the nuclear states are sufficiently stable to allow population and extraction of the lifetime .    in theoretical treatments",
    "the bound state approximation is very convenient , since the continuum is much harder to describe .",
    "most calculations employ a restrictive basis where the continuum does not enter , either because it is absent from the start or because it has been discretized . in spite of the many successes it is clear that resonance states do not have a well defined energy , and in principle they can not be described by a single wave function .",
    "the difficulties are increasing with decreasing lifetimes ( increasing widths ) of these continuum structures . at some point",
    "the widths are so large that the state has disappeared into the continuum background . however , much smaller widths already require clarification of the concept , and in particular how rotational states can be meaningfully understood .",
    "this basic theme of continuum properties is unavoidable in modern nuclear physics where far off beta stability and excited states are in focus @xcite .",
    "a few years ago a @xmath12-transition ( @xmath13 ) was measured in @xmath14be @xcite and found to be consistent with previous calculations of both @xmath15-@xmath15 bremsstrahlung cross sections @xcite and greens function monte carlo @xmath12-results @xcite . however ,",
    "both measurement and theories were very far from the rotational prediction and from comparable classical microscopic cluster model results , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is in spite of the agreement in the rotational energy sequence .",
    "furthermore , all models agree on the pronounced deformed @xmath15-@xmath15 cluster structure of the @xmath14be - nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus , even the simplest possible two - body nuclear structure already presents the problem , which has to be related to the behavior of continuum structures when the resonances are unmistakenly present but the widths are not negligibly small .",
    "the problem may lie either in the neglected polarization of the intrinsic @xmath15-structure for cluster models , in precise definitions of @xmath16-values for continuum models , in a spatially too confining basis in shell models , or in genuinely unexpected structure of the resonance wave functions .",
    "this paper is based on numerical results for two interacting alpha - particles . since",
    "an @xmath15-particle is a composite structure and we repeatedly use the word clusters and various types of related models , we shall specify our corresponding definitions .",
    "a cluster is an entity of particles , which can be anything from one genuine point - like particle to a group of many correlated particles , which preferentially effectively act collectively as one particle . in the present context",
    "the cluster is a group of bound particles with properties that essentially can be described as one particle but perhaps with an intrinsic structure .",
    "specifically we are here only concerned with the @xmath15-particle which conceptually in the first intrinsic layer consists of two neutrons and two protons .",
    "the deeper - lying layers involve virtual mesons , and further on the quark - gluon intrinsic structures of the nucleons .",
    "cluster models can then describe structures of ( and perhaps reactions between ) clusters where few - body properties are dominating .",
    "these properties may be derived from any of the deeper layers of intrinsic structures .",
    "we shall in this paper stay with point - like @xmath15-clusters , perhaps with finite radius , and each with at most an underlying layer of four nucleons .",
    "the pauli principle is accounted for by an effective @xmath17 interaction .",
    "a classical cluster model is then naturally defined as a model for point - like interacting particles without any intrinsic degrees of freedom , and with an effective phenomenological interaction . in microscopic cluster models",
    "the effective interaction is in principle derived from an approximation to the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the pauli principle .",
    "a classical microscopic cluster model is a microscopic version with an old relatively simple nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the concepts of rotational states in the continuum . taking the case of @xmath14be as an example , we shall pin - point the problems ,",
    "clarify the definitions , show how to avoid pit - falls , and give the minimum requirements for future model computations of continuum properties .",
    "we first in section ii briefly describe the basic ingredients , the pertinent formalism , notation and definitions .",
    "then in section iii we discuss the calculated numerical results in connection with the rotational model , that is energies and transition probabilities . in section",
    "iv we discuss various features of the transition matrix elements , validity conditions for appearance of collective rotations , and rotational states in heavier nuclei . in section v we finally give a summary and the conclusions .",
    "the rotational energy sequence is defined by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angular momentum and @xmath20 is the moment of inertia around the rotation axis .",
    "@xmath21 is the energy of the lowest state , @xmath22 , in the rotational band .",
    "we shall aim at computing the decay probability , which is simply related to the transition strength @xmath23 .",
    "we shall now only consider @xmath24 with the intended application on a system of two @xmath15-particles described in the relative coordinate system .",
    "the @xmath24 electric multipole transition is the lowest transition possible and the contribution from @xmath25 is orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "generalization of the formalism to @xmath26-values different from @xmath27 is straightforward , see @xcite .",
    "the immediate theoretical problem is that @xmath16 for continuum transitions is not uniquely defined .",
    "it is necessary to start with quantum mechanical observables , and from these define meaningful quantities to describe the desired decay probabilities .",
    "one unavoidable requirement is that relations between observables and derived quantities must be identical to the established expressions in the limit of bound states and very narrow resonances .",
    "we begin with the differential cross section for emission of a photon of energy @xmath28 , from an initial two - body continuum state of energy @xmath29 , arriving at a final continuum state of energy @xmath30 .",
    "the differential cross section for this process is given by @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 for two @xmath15-particles , @xmath33  mev  fm , @xmath34 is the energy of the emitted photon , @xmath19 and @xmath35 are the relative angular momenta between the two particles in the initial and final state , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the reduced mass of the two - body system ) .    the radial wave functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe two - body continuum structures , and they are solutions of the radial two - body schrdinger equation for the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "they obey the large - distance boundary condition @xmath40 , \\label{asymp}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the regular and irregular coulomb functions , @xmath43 is the nuclear phase shift , and the normalization constant is determined by the orthogonality condition : @xmath44    a delicate point in the calculation of the cross section refers to the procedure employed to obtain the integral in eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "the continuum wave functions do not drop off at infinity , and the radial integrals oscillate with larger and larger amplitudes as @xmath45 increases .",
    "this presents a severe numerical challenge . to overcome this problem we shall in this work",
    "employ the zeldovich prescription @xcite , which introduces the regularization factor , @xmath46 , in the radial integrand .",
    "this eliminates the many large amplitude oscillations at large distances which in any case mathematically can be shown to cancel out .",
    "the correct result is then obtained in the limit of zero value for the zeldovich parameter @xmath47 .",
    "fortunately , this method removes the unwanted large - distance oscillations and the remaining physical results are uniquely defined , since they are stable for sufficiently small values of @xmath47 .",
    "a formal discussion of this kind of integrals can be found in @xcite .",
    "the total cross section for emitting a photon of any energy , possibly confined to a pre - decided final energy interval @xmath48 , is obtained by integration @xmath49 where we implicitly assume that @xmath50 .",
    "the confining interval can be decided in a practical experimental measurement , for example as a window around a resonance energy in the final state .",
    "this selects then approximately resonance properties without continuum admixtures , although this in practice easily becomes ambiguous at the desired level of accuracy .    in the case of a transition into a bound state",
    "( @xmath51 describing a bound state with a well defined final energy ) , eq.([eq3 ] ) is still valid , with the only difference that the r.h.s . of the equation",
    "already gives the total cross section @xmath52 instead of the differential one ( note that the different dimension of a bound state wave function compared to the one of a continuum wave function , which can be seen for instance from eq.([asymp ] ) , makes the change dimensionally consistent ) .",
    "for this particular case of transition into a bound state the total cross section and the strength function are related by the well known expression @xmath53 which can be easily generalized to the case of transitions between continuum states as : @xmath54    from eqs.([eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) we can easily identify : @xmath55 which agrees with the standard definition : @xmath56 where now @xmath57 is the full initial two - body wave function ( and similarly for the final state wave function @xmath58 ) .    in practical continuum calculations",
    "it is rather frequent to employ some kind of discretization procedure . in this way the continuum is described by a set of states with discrete energies @xmath59 ,",
    "whose corresponding radial wave functions @xmath60 usually are normalized following the standard bound - state rule : @xmath61    making use of the relation between the dirac and kronecker deltas ( @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the energy separation between the two states ) and the continuum normalization rule , eq.([ener ] ) , it is possible to relate the continuum ( @xmath38 ) and the discretized continuum ( @xmath64 ) wave functions by : @xmath65 from which we have @xmath66    finally , the expression above and the closure relation @xmath67 lead to : @xmath68 which implies that after discretization of the continuum , the differential cross section eq.([eq3 ] ) should be computed with the replacement indicated in eq.([eq12 ] ) , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 run over the discrete initial and final states , respectively .",
    "thanks to the delta functions , the integral eq.([eq4a ] ) can be trivially calculated , and we get for the integrated cross section : @xmath71 in the same way that the integration eq.([eq4a ] ) can be restricted to final energies within some chosen final energy window , in eq.([eq14 ] ) the summation over @xmath70 can also be restricted to those discrete final states whose energy @xmath72 is contained in the chosen energy window . however , in order to reach a sufficient accuracy in the calculation , it is necessary to have a significant amount of discrete final energies within that window .    from eqs.([eq12 ] ) and ( [ dbde ] ) it is also evident that after discretization of the continuum the differential transition strength takes the form : @xmath73 from which we can in principle integrate over @xmath29 and obtain the total transition strength : @xmath74 where again the summation over @xmath70 could be restricted to the chosen final energy window .    for a given transition the total transition strength and the decay probability , @xmath75 , are related through @xmath76      in direct calculations @xmath16-values could in principle be obtained by use of expressions like eq.([eq10 ] ) or ( [ eq13a ] ) .",
    "however , an indiscriminate sum over initial and final states makes the result rather meaningless .",
    "the information about resonance properties is completely washed out and , even worse , weighted at the wrong energies .",
    "furthermore , due to the undesired divergence produced by the soft - photon contribution ( @xmath77 or @xmath78 ) @xcite , the calculation itself is pretty complicated .    instead",
    ", it is necessary to return to the observable cross sections , and then extract the transition strength from expressions like eqs.([eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "we have especially investigated two rather different methods to obtain @xmath16 values ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the first assumes a breit - wigner shape of the cross section ( [ eq4a ] ) or ( [ eq14 ] ) around the energy of the resonance in the initial channel .",
    "the resonance width is energy dependent , but at the resonance energy it has to be equal to the bare width of the resonance .",
    "the matching to the computed cross section provides the decay probability , @xmath75 , which through eq.([eq2 ] ) immediately gives @xmath16 .",
    "this method fundamentally assumes a breit - wigner shape of the cross section .",
    "this is only correct in a rather narrow range of energies around the resonance .",
    "this apparent restriction is perhaps physically reasonable since it corresponds to transitions between resonance peaks .",
    "the possibly undesired background continuum contributions are then eliminated ( compare to the discussion in section iv.a ) .",
    "the second method employs eq.([eq7 ] ) by integrating over the initial and final energies , @xmath29 and @xmath79 , which run over the chosen initial and final energy windows .",
    "if the photon energy , @xmath28 , were constant , this would immediately provide a @xmath16-value .",
    "however , since this assumption is incorrect , we must use an average value of @xmath80 in order to extract @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we define @xmath81 where @xmath28 is chosen as the difference between the energy of the cross section peak position and the energy of the resonance in the final state . again , this assumes information about resonance positions but as with the first method ( some of ) the continuum background contributions are eliminated .",
    "unavoidably the sensitivity is noticeable to rather small variations around a chosen @xmath28 due to the power of @xmath82 for @xmath16 transitions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these quantities are easily defined and measured for reactions where bound states are involved , and model calculations are numerous @xcite .",
    "this bound state limit is perfectly correct and well defined .",
    "however , difficulties begin to pile up when members of the rotational band reach into the continuum and acquire a width for decay through channels that lead to states outside the band .",
    "the energies may be relatively simply measured , and analyzed as peaks with widths populated in reactions or perhaps in decays from other channels @xcite .",
    "theoretical techniques to deal with these problems are discussed in details in ref.@xcite .",
    "calculations of energies and gamma - widths are ambiguous in the continuum , especially when the total width is large .",
    "an efficient method that permits to extract the energy and width of resonances is the complex scaling method @xcite , which after rotation of the radial coordinates into the complex plane makes the resonances appear formally as bound states with complex energy .",
    "the resonances obtained in this way correspond to the poles of the @xmath6-matrix , and the real and imaginary parts of the complex energy describe respectively , the resonance position and half the width .",
    "the corresponding complex rotated resonance wave function is also obtained by this method .    it may then be illuminating to compare the @xmath16-value with those obtained by the precise resonance definition in the complex scaling method . here",
    "the resonance wave functions are well defined and their ( complex ) energy difference as well .",
    "this provides uniquely a resonance - to - resonance , complex scaled @xmath16-value . in principle , the full transition strength eq.([eq13a ] ) can also be computed within the complex scaling framework @xcite . however , although this method allows a clean and precise extraction of the resonances , the contact with the observable quantities is sometimes less direct .",
    "in particular , when transitions involve continuum states , all the difficulties arising from the description of the continuum states themselves would mix with the interpretation of the complex scaled transition strength , which furthermore is a complex quantity .",
    "we have chosen to illustrate our understanding of continuum structures with @xmath14be , which is the simplest non - trivial two - body cluster nucleus .",
    "the effective interaction between the two @xmath15-particles is very well known from scattering experiments and the subsequent analysis in terms of partial wave phase shifts . a number of potentials reproducing the low - energy elastic scattering cross sections are available .",
    "we shall employ the buck - potential @xcite and version _ d _ of the ali - bodmer potentials given in @xcite .",
    "the buck potential has two spurious deep - lying @xmath17 bound states for @xmath83-waves , and one more for @xmath84-waves .",
    "when necessary , the spurious states can be removed by the construction of a phase equivalent potential @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the transition probability on the potential is of basic interest , since the contributing parts of the wave functions are expected to be at short distances .",
    "identical phase shifts reflect identical large - distance properties but with different nodes at short distances .",
    "thus , interaction dependent transition probabilities may arise . in other words",
    "the @xmath16-values could be able to distinguish between potentials of different short - distance properties , that is , in particular , between buck and ali - bodmer potentials .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the @xmath16 transition strength shows very minor changes when switching from one of the interactions to the other .",
    "the bosonic nature of the @xmath15-particle constrains the possible excited states to have even angular momenta and positive parity . in fig.[fig1 ] we show the phase shifts as a function of the @xmath17 relative energy for the @xmath85 partial waves .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to the results obtained with the buck potential and the ali - bodmer potential , respectively .",
    "the inset in panel ( a ) gives the extremely rapidly varying @xmath83-wave phase shifts in the vicinity of the @xmath86 resonance energy in @xmath14be .",
    "the computed phase shifts are remarkably similar for both potentials , even for large relative angular momenta .",
    "the computed @xmath14be spectrum is then expected not to change very much from one potential to the other .",
    "as already mentioned , the complex scaling method permits an easy evaluation of the resonance energies and widths .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath14be are given in table  [ tab1 ] along with the experimentally known resonance energies and widths @xcite .",
    "the buck and ali - bodmer potentials both , as expected from the phase shifts , provide very similar spectra .",
    "together with the @xmath86 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 states whose energies and widths reproduce rather well the experimental values , both potentials predict a @xmath4 and an @xmath5 state at about 34 mev and 52 mev , respectively .",
    "no experimental evidence of these states is known . in any case , the computed widths for these two last resonances are comparable to their energies and therefore they can not be considered as well defined resonances . a similar proportion between width and energy as for the 2@xmath87 and @xmath3 states would for the same energies give widths of about 2.5 times smaller values , that is 13 mev and 21 mev for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states , respectively .",
    "an important point to take into account is the fact that the energy of the @xmath86 resonance is very sensitive to the @xmath88-value ( with @xmath89 being the mass of the alpha - particle ) used in the calculation .",
    "the experimentally known value is @xmath90 mev@xmath91@xmath92 .",
    "this is used for all the calculations with the ali - bodmer potential . however",
    ", when the same value is used with the buck potential @xcite the @xmath86 resonance appears at 0.18 mev , almost a factor of 2 higher than the experimental value .",
    "the potential parameters given in @xcite are therefore probably obtained with @xmath93 mev@xmath91@xmath92 , which places the @xmath86 resonance at the correct value .",
    "the effects on the @xmath86 resonance and the @xmath83-wave phase shifts are given in table  [ tab1 ] and the solid line in the inset of fig.[fig1]a .",
    "the other resonances ( with @xmath94 ) are much less sensitive to this change in @xmath88 .",
    "this original value is maintained when the buck - potential is used in this paper .",
    "the two - body potentials giving rise to all these resonances are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "together with the nuclear interaction ( that for the figure has been chosen to be the buck potential ) the potentials shown in the figure contain as well the coulomb repulsion and the centrifugal barrier . for @xmath22",
    "the potential barrier is hardly noticeable but the resonance energy is still smaller and the state experiences an extremely thick barrier leading to almost bound state properties . for @xmath95",
    "the barrier is much higher and thinner but the energy is not far from the top and the resulting widths are rather large .",
    "the details of the different potential barriers are shown in the inset . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the potentials are repulsive .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the @xmath6-matrix poles apparently are well defined and independent of the interactions , determined solely from the phase shifts of the partial waves of smaller @xmath19-values .",
    "for this reason we include the results for @xmath96 , although a resonance description is a stretch of this concept .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an additional , and in a sense decisive , test of the rotational character of the states in @xmath14be is provided by the total transition strength given in eq.([eq13a ] ) . for rotational bands with an inert intrinsic structure ,",
    "the total strength for two inert @xmath15-particles at @xmath97 is @xcite @xmath98 the spatial extension of the spherical @xmath15-particle distribution does not enter this expression in contrast to the moment of inertia in eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "the different transition strengths are then related by the expression : @xmath99 the approximation in eq.([eq5 ] ) is valid for rigorous rotational bands , and therefore in particular also for two rotating @xmath15-particles where eq.([eq15 ] ) applies . comparing to eq.([eq13a ] ) this is seen to imply that the integrals should be independent of the transition , which reflects that the radial wave functions and then the intrinsic structure is the same for all the states .    in the schematic rotational model of eq.([eq15 ] ) we get all the transition strengths for a given @xmath100 .",
    "they are useful for comparison and interpretation .",
    "we first choose a constant @xmath101  fm , which was the value chosen to obtain the sequence of states denoted by @xmath102 in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the strength values given by eq.([eq15 ] ) are shown in the 6@xmath103 column of table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "they are clearly different to the @xmath16-values obtained in @xcite , no matter the size of the window used and the procedure used to extract it .",
    "it is quite clear that the transition strengths do not follow the rule dictated by the strict rotational model .",
    "the same conclusion is reached when examining the transition strength ratios .",
    "the value of @xmath104 is 0.2 , 0.29 , 0.31 , and 0.33 for the @xmath105 , @xmath13 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 transitions , respectively . when taking the @xmath108 transition as a reference , the ratios given by the rotational model , eq.([eq5 ] ) , are shown by the numbers within parenthesis in the 6@xmath103 column of the table .",
    "the last three transitions should then have a rather similar strength , which in turn should be larger than the strength corresponding to the @xmath105 .",
    "nothing of this happens with the @xmath17 potentials .",
    "the ratios obtained with the transition strengths in ref.@xcite ( given by the corresponding numbers within parenthesis in each of the columns in table  [ tab2 ] ) are clearly smaller , and the maximum transition strength is actually obtained for the @xmath105 transition .",
    "the behavior predicted by the rotational model coincides with the one found with the microscopic cluster model @xcite ( 10@xmath103 column in the table ) , although the absolute values are about a factor of 3 different .",
    "this corresponds to a larger value of @xmath109  fm consistent with the spatial extension found in @xcite .",
    "this resemblance of the rotational model and the classical microscopic cluster model results is perhaps not very surprising , since the @xmath17 structure after all is imposed in both cases .",
    "however , the cluster model in @xcite is based on a generator coordinate description where angular momentum projection before and after variation both start out with the same @xmath17 cluster structure .",
    "the different angular momentum states are then related through a similar intrinsic structure , which can be somewhat differently deformed depending on angular momentum , but still the basic rotational model assumptions are approached and almost fulfilled . in contrast , the potential models with effective @xmath17-interactions provide independent solutions for each of the angular momenta .",
    "the solutions are only related through the same central potential .",
    "it is then clear that the radial integrals in eq.([eq13a ] ) change with angular momentum and produce unexpected transition strengths .",
    "the different spatial structure of the resonances was already seen when analyzing the @xmath110-values , which for instance for the @xmath86 case is about twice the value in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 cases .",
    "in fact , in the previous section we saw that when using different values for @xmath111 for each resonance , the energy sequence in @xmath14be was nicely reproduced .",
    "it is then very tempting to check if the same good agreement is recovered when using @xmath111 for each resonance in eq.([eq15 ] ) .",
    "more precisely we have chosen for each transition the @xmath100 value corresponding to the final state resonance .",
    "the results obtained are given in the 7@xmath103 column of table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "as we can see , now the agreement with the results in @xcite is definitely much better , especially with the @xmath112-values when using the @xmath113 final energy window . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding ratios ( numbers within parenthesis ) also agree much better now .",
    "this result seems to confirm the conclusion reached in the previous section , namely , the @xmath14be spectrum has a rotational character provided that the @xmath17 distance is angular momentum dependent . still the principal @xmath15-cluster structure is maintained .",
    "to discuss quantitatively we should preferentially apply the method to specific systems as we did in the previous sections .",
    "we shall here first discuss the radial dependence of wave functions in the continuum .",
    "this is numerically simple by use of the complex scaling method .",
    "however , the properties of the corresponding complex rotated wave function then only represent a part of the cross section .",
    "other parts related to continuum contributions are necessary to obtain the full observable cross sections .",
    "complex scaling mixes these contributions in a complicated manner , but we expect the resonance structures to be strongly indicative for the overall behavior .    to supplement we discuss instead the properties of the wave functions and the resulting transitions for real energies , where the interesting physics is hiding behind diverging integrals .",
    "we continue to discuss basic conditions for appearance of rotational motion in two - body systems .",
    "we then turn high - spin states created in heavy - ion collisions often claimed to be of rotational structure .",
    "the definition of transition probabilities is in practice not well defined since the states are not well defined either in the continuum .",
    "it is then interesting to know the results for transitions between the rigorously defined resonance states found by complex rotation .",
    "however , the probabilities are then `` rotated '' into the complex values given in the last row of table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the results in the present work do not depend significantly on the potential , and we therefore only give the results for the buck potential .",
    "they are independent of rotation angle as required by well defined resonances , but obviously they can not represent observable quantities .",
    "first , the results are complex numbers .",
    "second , they are only part of the full observables , which include both resonance - to - resonance and continuum background contributions @xcite",
    ".    the ratios of these partial transition probabilities ( in brackets in the last column in table  [ tab2 ] ) now show the same behavior of the factor of @xmath114 decrease from the @xmath105 to the @xmath115 transition as for the full calculation using only real energies . the imaginary part is 10 times smaller than the real part .",
    "however , the real parts of the next two ratios involving the rather artificial @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances increases almost in line with the schematic rotational model . the imaginary parts of these complex numbers are still a factor of 3 smaller than the real parts of these ratios .    therefore , the observable relative transition probabilities for the first 3 resonances ( not the last ) in the first columns of table  [ tab2 ] are almost recovered in the complex resonance - to - resonance relative transitions .",
    "these can in turn be understood by their decreasing @xmath116-values of the resonances as given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the very large deviations from the rotational model arise from a decreasing spatial extension of the @xmath86 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances .    however , an understanding of the properties obtained entirely by calculations for real energies is much more complicated",
    ". nevertheless , we shall in the following attempt a detailed explanation .",
    "the radial wave functions for the lowest three resonances are shown in fig.[fig3a ] both non - regularized and multiplied by an appropriate zeldovich factor . in principle , for a given value of the zeldovich parameter , the radial wave functions should be accordingly renormalized , such that eqs.([ener ] ) or ( [ ort ] ) are restored",
    ". however , the wave functions are already initially normalized , and when taking the limit of zero @xmath47-value the correct normalization condition is recovered faster than the converged value of the radial integral . therefore , in practice the renormalization is not needed .",
    "as seen in the figure , the @xmath117 state behaves as a bound state , although tiny oscillations are visible at large distances before the zeldovich cut - off becomes efficient ( inset in fig.[fig3a]a ) .",
    "the two nodes at small distances are due to the deep potential with two spurious strongly bound states .    for both the @xmath118 and @xmath119 resonances the oscillations are very pronounced up to about @xmath120  fm , where the zeldovich regularized wave function essentially has vanished .",
    "the resonance structures are only visible at very small distances , where the first oscillation of each state inside the attractive region of the potential , has twice the amplitude of the second .",
    "note that in fig.4 only the radial wave functions @xmath121 are shown , while the total radial wave function is actually given by @xmath122 .",
    "when dividing by @xmath45 we can see that the @xmath86 resonance behaves as a bound state , and both , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , reveal resonance character only at distances smaller than about @xmath82  fm .",
    "the period in the oscillations in fig.[fig3a ] depends only on the resonance energies through the wave number , @xmath123 , which gives wave lengths @xmath124  fm , 12  fm , and 6  fm , respectively .",
    "the coulomb barriers for these states extend correspondingly to about 60  fm , 10  fm , and 5  fm , that is the regular oscillations all occur outside the barriers for positive kinetic energies .",
    "the transitions are determined as integrals over radial wave functions , see eq.([eq13a ] ) .",
    "we show in fig.[fig3b ] the integrands of the matrix elements for the lowest transitions for energies corresponding to resonance peaks .",
    "the oscillations appearing now are the results of combining the two oscillating wave functions .",
    "their different periods produce the different ( from the wave functions ) but regular oscillation extending to about 200  fm . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the revival after destructive interference is seen before the zeldovich cut - off reduce the amplitude to be insignificant . for @xmath126 , the amplitude increases to about 100  fm / mev up to 100  fm and is in fact only a few fm / mev at small distances .",
    "it is now highly significant that the integrals themselves are only a few @xmath92/mev .",
    "this means that the oscillations of the integrands cancel to a very large extent , where it may be necessary to emphasize that a substantial range of zeldovich parameters , @xmath127 @xmath128 , produces precisely the same matrix element .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.6 , where the solid and dashed curves show the integrals of the functions in figs.[fig3b]a and [ fig3b]b , but as a function of the zeldovich parameter @xmath47 .",
    "as we can see , for sufficiently small values of @xmath47 , the computed integrals become constant .",
    "the wave functions and the matrix elements in figs.[fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] are shown for @xmath129  @xmath128 , which reveal the large amplitude oscillations at rather large distances .",
    "a variation of @xmath47 from very small to large values , @xmath130  @xmath128 , would move the damping of the wave functions in fig.[fig3a ] and the oscillating structures in fig.[fig3b ] down to smaller distances , bit still leaving untouched the small distance part of the wave functions , where the resonance structure is contained .",
    "it is then remarkable that the transition probabilities between states of given energies are numerically well defined to values much smaller than corresponding to the large amplitudes at large distances .",
    "however , to extract the decisive short - distance properties of the resonance wave functions is much more difficult .",
    "the cancellation at large distances implies that these oscillations only play a minor role in the determination of the transition probability .",
    "in fact , only distances of less than about @xmath82  fm contribute corresponding to the spatial extension of the regions where resonance character is seen in fig.[fig3a ] . to be on the safe side where the matrix elements still can be reliably obtained numerically , we choose the value of @xmath129  @xmath131 in all cases investigated in the present work . more detail will be presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "if we use the complex scaling method , the oscillations in figs.[fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] disappear altogether in the complex scaled resonance wave functions , and radii and transition matrix elements are well defined .",
    "this does not prevent larger distances from giving significant contributions .",
    "the smaller radii for larger angular momenta seen in table  [ tab1 ] are the opposite of the ordinary centrifugal stretching .",
    "this is related to properties of real energy calculations where the increasing widths of the resonances arise as they approach the top of the barriers .",
    "the states then approach free waves in most space .",
    "the free wave oscillations are quickly approached in figs.[fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] before the zeldovich factor is applied .",
    "only deviations from the free wave can contribute to resonance properties , and in turn to results for transition probabilities like @xmath12-values .",
    "therefore , the smaller the radii of the space exhibiting deviations from free waves , the smaller are the radial moments , and in turn the radial transition matrix elements also decrease .    to understand this a little better we turn to the asymptotic behavior of the continuum wave functions in eq.([asymp ] ) .",
    "let us first define the asymptotically vanishing function @xmath132    the remaining function , @xmath133 , now contains the resonance structure revealed at short distances , and traces of the oscillating continuum structures are removed .",
    "the precise asymptotic behavior from eq.([asymp ] ) is only correct for point - like charge distributions , or at distances where the charges do not overlap . at smaller distances the function in eq.([asymp ] ) is incorrect and even diverging for distances approaching zero . to get physically meaningful results we have to account for the finite extension of the charges",
    "this is easily done by a regularization procedure or by extending the coulomb wave functions down to zero by combinations of sine and cosine functions as in the case of no coulomb interaction or from the corresponding asymptotic limit of the coulomb functions .",
    "we choose first the true asymptotics from eq.([asymp ] ) and show in fig.[fignew ] the three resonance wave functions , @xmath134 ( dashed curves ) , and its asymptotic behavior ( solid curves ) , as function of @xmath45 . at distances larger than @xmath82  fm the full and the asymptotic wave functions are indistinguishable .",
    "this is in full agreement with the resonance radii in table  [ tab1 ] , fig.[fig3a ] , as well as the discussion in connection with the transition matrix elements in fig.[fig3b ] .",
    "the division into short and asymptotic parts in eqs.([smooth ] ) and ( [ smooth1 ] ) is now directly applicable in a separation of contributions from the different parts .",
    "this is highly desirable in analyses of experimental data using the @xmath135-matrix formulation where any continuum contribution appears as spurious resonances strongly depending on the channel radius .",
    "we can calculate the radial transition matrix element , @xmath136 , which naturally is divided into four types of terms involving short - distance and asymptotic parts in different combinations , i.e. @xmath137 where the notation of the contributions to @xmath138 refers to short - distance and asymptotic combinations .",
    "a tempting interpretation is the correspondence of contributions from respectively resonance to resonance @xmath139 , resonance to continuum @xmath140 , continuum to resonance @xmath141 , and continuum to continuum @xmath142 .    at very large distances the wave functions",
    "@xmath38 are governed by a combination of sine and cosine functions of @xmath143 , as it can be seen from eq.([asymp ] ) .",
    "the terms of the type @xmath144 contain then in the integrand products of either two sine functions , or two cosine functions , or one sine and one cosine functions .",
    "these integrals are therefore not well defined unless the zeldovich regularization is applied . when done , we obtain vanishing results both when two @xmath145-type and two @xmath146-type functions are combined , whereas finite results emerge when products of @xmath145 and @xmath147 functions appear ( or the other way around ) .",
    "these conclusions assume that @xmath148 .",
    "all other terms in @xmath138 have the @xmath149-functions as factors , and the corresponding integrals are convergent and well defined .",
    "one immediate consequence is that @xmath144 is zero when initial and final state wave functions both correspond precisely with resonance states , where the phase shifts are @xmath150 .",
    "the products of the asymptotic parts are equal to zero since @xmath151 , and only terms of the type @xmath146 survive in the asymptotic part of the wave function .",
    "therefore , only terms where the @xmath149 wave functions enter give non - vanishing contributions to @xmath152 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figp]a , where we plot @xmath153 as a function of the final energy @xmath79 and for an initial energy of @xmath154 mev , which corresponds to a @xmath3 phase - shift equal to @xmath150 .",
    "the total value is shown by the solid curve . the @xmath155-contribution is given by the short - dashed curve , which is very small for all the final energies shown , and it is particularly close to zero in the vicinity of @xmath156 mev , which is the value at which the 2@xmath87 phase shift is @xmath150 .    this is consistent with our classical intuition where resonances are located in the continuum with large amplitudes at short distances and comparably small and non - contributing amplitudes at large distance .",
    "still , even here the terms @xmath157 and @xmath158 are non - vanishing , although only relatively short distances can contribute due to the @xmath149-functions .",
    "these terms may represent unavoidable continuum background contributions as it can be seen in fig.[figp]a , where especially the @xmath140 contribution ( dot - dashed curve ) is very significant .",
    "the interference between the different contributions is very substantial .",
    "however , the contributions must arise from radii where the @xmath149 functions are finite , that is the large amplitude oscillation seen in fig.[fig3b ] necessarily cancels completely .",
    "when the initial and final state energies differ from the resonance energies the @xmath144-contribution is then not identically equal to zero , although well defined after the zeldovich regularization .",
    "this is shown in fig.[figp]b , where the initial energy ( @xmath159 mev ) does not correspond to any @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the interference contribution is again substantial . in this case",
    "the @xmath142 contribution ( short - dashed curve ) is clearly relevant , although the major contribution from the asymptotic part is again the @xmath140 one , given by the dot - dashed curve .",
    "we are now equipped to summarize the validity of the ordinarily used long wavelength approximation where the contributing radii should be smaller than the inverse of the wave number .",
    "the total resonance wave function in fig.[fig3a ] reveals a larger amplitude at small distances than for the asymptotic oscillations .",
    "this is much clearer seen in fig.[fignew ] , where the deviation between full and asymptotic wave functions are shown .",
    "the radial extension is in agreement with the root - mean - square values of the resonances given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the contribution to the matrix elements arise from rather small distances as seen by comparing amplitudes of the integrand in fig.[fig3b ] with the very much smaller integrated result .",
    "the large large - distance oscillations must therefore essentially cancel .",
    "the non - vanishing values of @xmath149 necessary to get contributions are confined to radii less than 5 fm as seen in fig.[fignew ] .",
    "this is much smaller than the smallest contributing wavelength of @xmath160  fm arising from the largest contributing photon energy of @xmath161  mev .",
    "the estimate of the contributing photon energy interval can be seen in fig.[fig2a ] , where we show the distribution of strength for the transition cross sections from given initial to final state energies .",
    "the bulk contribution are concentrated in peaks corresponding to a photon energy of substantially less than @xmath162  mev in the worst case of the tail of the @xmath13 transition .",
    "thus , the long wavelength approximation is rather accurate .",
    "the classical rotation of an isolated inert system is characterized by its kinetic energy , which can be expressed as either the square of the angular momentum divided by twice the moment of inertia around the rotation axis , or half of the square of the rotation frequency times the same moment of inertia .",
    "the convenient quantum mechanical version is in terms of the conserved and quantized angular momentum .",
    "an ideal analogue is then a two - body cluster structure with a strongly attractive one - dimensional delta - shell potential like @xmath163 .",
    "the ground state wave function of zero angular momentum is localized at the relative distance @xmath164 .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic wave function localized in one point , @xmath165 , and averaged with equal weights over all spatial directions . for finite angular momentum , @xmath19 ,",
    "the energy is increased by @xmath166 , where @xmath167 . the relative distance for a bound state",
    "would still be @xmath100 , and the use of relative coordinate requires the use of the reduced mass @xmath37 .",
    "the rotational spectrum is then recovered .    for an attractive potential of finite range like a square well or a gaussian potential",
    ", the rotational structures do not automatically appear .",
    "a repulsion at short distance and a confining barrier at larger distances would lead to a potential of @xmath168-shell character . if it is deep enough the rotational spectrum would then again arise .",
    "these repulsive potentials could in principle be provided by a coulomb interaction between point - like particles .",
    "both short and long - range repulsions would appear .",
    "however , these barriers are very easily either small or not present at all .",
    "conditions for a rotational spectrum with only an attractive finite range potential can be seen by use of simple potentials . the harmonic oscillator potential gives energies linear in @xmath19 while the energies for a spherical square well potential are more promising . for a deep - lying bound state",
    "the boundary condition is approximately , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath19 , @xmath135 is the radius and @xmath171 the wave number .",
    "the nodes of these bessel functions approach @xmath172 for large @xmath19 , and the corresponding energies found from the square of @xmath171 are then approaching @xmath173 which is the semiclassical analog of @xmath174 . thus in this limit",
    "the rotational spectrum also emerges , and three levels of the rotational sequence can approximately be reproduced with one free parameter like the radius or the moment of inertia .",
    "then , we conclude that if a flat potential is sufficiently deep then the rotational energy sequence arises .",
    "this reflects the classical knowledge that the kinetic energy is responsible for the rotational character of a system described by a rotational invariant hamiltonian .",
    "the other limit , where the potential is unable to support bound states of non - zero or moderate angular momenta , is for the same reason not necessarily of rotational character .",
    "it is then somewhat surprising that the @xmath14be states to some extent reveal this character even as resonances .    for states deeply bound in a short - range attractive potential",
    "the centrifugal barrier term is comparatively small and the radial wave functions are expected to be roughly independent of @xmath19 . then the rotational sequence of transition probabilities",
    "would be approximately obeyed .",
    "however , these states must be strongly bound , and certainly not simply unbound resonance structures in the continuum .",
    "we can then conjecture that the rotational model for a two - body inert structure is valid for very strong short - range attractions , and viceversa invalid when the attraction becomes comparable to the centrifugal barrier term .",
    "it is still not excluded that resonance structures approximately could obey the necessary independence of the radial integrals in order to validate the rotational transition sequences .",
    "the regularization of the continuum wave functions influences the corresponding radial integrals but it is not obvious that the higher - lying energy and angular momentum states are less spatially extended .",
    "the explanation is that the oscillating behavior appears at shorter distances when the state is closest to the barrier .",
    "the regularization removes the corresponding contribution by subtraction of the diverging large - distance part of the wave function .",
    "the result is decreasing radial integral and increasing deviation from the rotational model .",
    "this could be an artifact of the present procedure but the measured datum confirms this interpretation .",
    "it is therefore highly interesting to obtain more experimental data for verification or possibly falsification of the present interpretation .",
    "we should finally emphasize that the presence of other types of excitation also may destroy the validity of the pure rotational model .",
    "such bound states or resonances are abundantly arising from intrinsic degrees of freedom or other collective motion like vibrations .",
    "effective decoupling of rotational states from other excited states would be achieved when the excitation energies of the rotations are much lower than all other excitations . however",
    ", this can not continue indefinitely to high excitations where other degrees of freedom may be excited as well . for comparable energies",
    "the coupling producing mixed states can be very moderate and the pure pictures are no longer valid .",
    "it is still possible to have rotational states at relatively high energy provided that other degrees of freedom either produce excited states far away and of much larger energy separation than the rotations , or in practice decoupled due to e.g. disparate structures of all other excited states of comparable excitation energies .",
    "the fact that a large number of nuclear spectra exhibit rotational structure @xcite demands an explanation .",
    "the heavy - ion populated high - spin states reach more than 50 units of @xmath175 .",
    "many different high - spin bands apparently appear in the same nucleus , a typical example can be found in @xcite .",
    "transitions are measured between intra , as well as inter , band members .",
    "still , the interpretation is in terms of rotational bands .",
    "as discussed above , the validity of the rotational model seems to rely on an effectively strong binding which allows the exited states to be strongly bound as well .",
    "this is achieved for nuclear states where lifetimes or widths are determined or dominated by photon emission processes . any other decays like fission , nucleon and cluster emission are then strongly hindered .",
    "a barrier must then effectively be present in all other decay channels than photon emission .",
    "the result is that the nucleus then must behave as a strongly bound system .",
    "this apparent strong binding can be directly due to a huge barrier against decay as for example fission of intermediate mass nuclei",
    ". a barrier may also be effectively present if restructuring is required to arrive at the final decay product as for example for @xmath15-emission of nuclei without traces of @xmath15-clustering .",
    "the pronounced rotational structures are also first of all found for relatively small energies .",
    "the numerous high - spin states and the abundantly experimentally obtained rotational spectra are not necessarily contradicting this interpretation .",
    "the transition probabilities for the high - spin states are also often not following the rotational model that well .",
    "there is always the centrifugal stretching , higher order corrections even to the rotational energy spectra , deformation and pairing variations , etc . @xcite",
    "furthermore , if the preferred decay channel is fission , particle or cluster emission , the large width of the states prohibit accurate direct measurement of the transition probabilities .",
    "such states may possibly be members of a rotational sequence of energies , but their photon emission probabilities are not observables .",
    "a full population and decay history in terms of cross sections are required to get a meaningful description as in the case of @xmath14be discussed in this paper .",
    "we investigate the simplest structure able to exhibit quantum mechanical rotational motion : two spin - zero inert @xmath15-particles .",
    "we first sketch the formalism which is precisely valid for bound states , but present increasing problems as the continuum properties becomes more pronounced .",
    "we first explain that it is absolutely necessary to use observables for continuum calculations .",
    "the structure information via the @xmath16-values can not be obtained directly without very severe restrictions to energies around the resonances between which the transition occurs .    staying with observables",
    "has the positive implication that direct comparison with measurements is possible .",
    "however , the structure information is then hidden in pieces of the observables .",
    "one conclusion is therefore that structure and reaction can not be disentangled and we have to live with this lack of information about the continuum structures .",
    "we show that it is possible to derive structure information , although the results are inherently uncertain due to the unavoidable use of non - observable quantities .",
    "we describe two procedures to derive the non - observable @xmath16-values which contain information about the structure of the resonances .",
    "we show that the rotational energy sequence and corresponding radii are followed by the resonances .",
    "however , in contrast the transition probabilities deviate substantially from the rotational model predictions .",
    "first , this is not due to the uncertainties arising from the extraction of these non - observable continuum properties .",
    "it is also not due to neglect of intrinsic @xmath15-structure , @xmath15-polarization or effective charges , or centrifugal stretching effects .",
    "the deviations are traced to an unexpected radial dependence of the relative resonance wave functions .",
    "they contract as the barrier is approached , and the only experimental point confirms this result .",
    "however , it is worth emphasizing that the corresponding continuum wave functions are a priory non - normalizable .",
    "a suitable regularization procedure is necessary to extract observable quantities , which in turn can be related to the mentioned radial contraction .    in classical cluster models",
    "the rotational predictions are followed much more accurately , as these models resemble rigid rotors .",
    "modern variational or shell model calculations are often treating the resonances as bound states .",
    "these calculations therefore altogether unphysically avoid the problems connected to continuum properties .",
    "the results are an uncontrolled average comparable to those of proper continuum models but the tendencies do not point in one direction .",
    "our results are independent of the potentials employed as long as the low - energy @xmath17 phase shifts reproduce the measured values .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as the transition operator seems to be sensitive to the contributing short - distance properties of the wave functions .",
    "the potentials are only marginally able to hold resonances , and for example @xmath176 is even higher than the barrier but still clearly revealing a pole in the @xmath6-matrix .",
    "this is , strangely enough , also the case for @xmath96 where the widths are huge and normally would be contradicting a description as resonance states .",
    "a better interpretation is in terms of a broad background contribution at these energies .",
    "the many known low - energy rotational states in intermediate and heavy nuclei presumably require no new interpretation .",
    "they effectively behave as bound states since they are below separation thresholds or an enormous restructuring is required to decay through other channels than photon emission .",
    "we expect this can not also hold for the high - lying high - spin states so abundantly observed and described as rotations .",
    "their energies may form rotational sequences , perhaps somewhat modified , but corresponding transition probabilities do not necessarily also follow the predictions of the rotational model .",
    "this is briefly discussed in the present investigation .",
    "closer inspection of the transition probabilities between the expected rotational states in heavier nuclei could reveal a similar behavior as for @xmath0be .",
    "such projects should be formulated and carried out , although we anticipate this would be very difficult for these many - body systems .",
    "a short - term direct perspective of the present investigation is to apply the understanding to more complicated cluster structures like three @xmath15-particles .",
    "this is straightforward with the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method , although numerically much more elaborate .",
    "more generally , the lessons about transitions between continuum states must be incorporated in analyses and interpretations of the corresponding ( few- and many - body ) experimentally and theoretically obtained structures .",
    "another short - term application is related to the extracted structure information obtained from transition matrix elements .",
    "we have formulated a simple procedure to divide the contributions into four pieces , that is the wave function is a sum of short - distance and regularized asymptotic parts .",
    "the tempting interpretation is corresponding to resonance - resonance , continuum - resonance , resonance - continuum , and continuum - continuum contributions .",
    "substantial contributions are found for the resonance - to - continuum matrix element even when both initial and final state energies are chosen to be precisely at the resonances .",
    "the interference between the various terms constitute a major contribution to the total transition probability .",
    "however , the interpretation of this division can not be taken too far for two reasons .",
    "first , because far away from resonance energies the short - distance contributions may still dominate , and hence not qualify as a resonance contribution .",
    "second , the transition probability is obtained by squaring the matrix element which necessarily further entangles the division between resonance and continuum contributions .",
    "we believe that appropriately defined energy windows combined with the suggested division will be helpful in future analyses of experimental data where continuum background contributions should be separated from that of the pure resonance structure .",
    "this perspective deserves much more attention in future investigations .    in conclusion ,",
    "rotational bands embedded in the continuum may still be a meaningful concept but unexpected tendencies and significant deviations from schematic model predictions can be present .",
    "this warning is so far only based on the decay and structure of the @xmath0be two - body system .",
    "the traditional rotational structure investigations of the @xmath0be excited states has to be quantitatively substantially modified .",
    "the scarce experimental evidence supports the present theoretical interpretation . in general",
    ", the continuum background plays an important role , and should be separated out in analyses where only resonance properties enter . on the other hand , corresponding contributions can probably not be avoided , and has therefore to be included .",
