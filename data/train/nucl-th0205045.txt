    "direct radiative capture cross sections of charged particles a(p,@xmath1)b drop so sharply for the low energy region of stellar environment that it is often impossible to measure these rates at the appropriate energies in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "then , typically , the direct capture cross sections are measured at higher energies followed by an extrapolation down to zero energy . therefore , the knowledge of the energy behavior of the cross section as @xmath11 is of crucial importance .    when an incident charged particle approaches a target it should penetrate through the coulomb and centrifugal barriers in the initial state .",
    "the capture to a loosely bound state is the transition from the initial scattering state to the tail of the bound state wave function in the final state .",
    "this tail is affected by the coulomb and centrifugal barriers in the final state .",
    "thus , the radiative capture process is affected by four barriers , two coulomb and two centrifugal barriers , implicitly present through the four parameters @xmath12 .",
    "all barriers have a similar effect on the radiative cross section : they decrease the probability of the reaction at sub - barrier energies .",
    "the cross section is usually factorized into the gamow penetration factor , and the astrophysical s - factor : @xmath13 the gamow penetration factor is no more than the probability for an @xmath14-wave proton to penetrate through the pure coulomb barrier ( i.e. the coulomb potential is extended down to the origin @xmath15 assuming a pointlike target ) .",
    "naturally , this factor defines only the gross energy behavior .",
    "in fact , as the capture to loosely bound states occurs under the coulomb barrier , at a large distance from the target , the effective penetration factor is larger than the gamow penetration factor in eq .",
    "( [ radcp1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we call _ remnant coulomb barrier _ the remaining energy dependence of the astrophysical factor s(e ) due to the initial coulomb barrier , after removing the gamow factor",
    ". this remnant effect behaves in an opposite way to the normal barrier behavior , namely , it reduces the s - factor as the energy increases , to compensate the overestimation by the gamow factor .",
    "it turns out that , depending on the system , s - factors can feature completely opposite behaviors as one approaches zero energy . despite the long history of s - factor calculations and the numerous papers published on this subject , no satisfactory physical explanation for the different behaviors has been presented . in recent papers @xcite some aspects of the low energy behavior of the direct capture",
    "s - factors were investigated . in @xcite ,",
    "the low energy rise of the s - factor was attributed to the pole in the energy plane , located at @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 being the binding energy of the final nucleus @xmath18 relative to proton threshold ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the integral form for the first three terms of the taylor expansion were derived , using a potential model . in either work ,",
    "the physical reasons for specific patterns in the s - factor energy behavior were not considered .",
    "if the rise of @xmath2 were in fact caused by the pole how could one understand the decreasing @xmath2 for @xmath19(gr .",
    "st . ) , a case where the pole is extremely close to the threshold ? why should the s - factor for @xmath20 have a steeper slope near the threshold than the s - factor for @xmath21 ?",
    "what are the crucial parameters defining the behavior of the s - factor for the direct captures to loosely bound states ?",
    "is it possible to define general thumb rules ?",
    "it is clear that accurate numerical values for direct capture s - factors are trivially calculated with present day technology . for that reason analytical works",
    "have not been highly appreciated .",
    "regardless , this work is a search for the understanding of the general physical features , based on analytical considerations .",
    "the vast majority of the direct proton radiative capture reactions with interest to astrophysics , are dominated by @xmath0 transitions .",
    "we will thus concentrate on the @xmath0 transition for the @xmath22 process .",
    "we also confine ourselves to loosely bound final states .",
    "the interest on the behavior of the s - factors for the direct captures reactions goes beyond @xmath23-shell nuclei .",
    "the heavier , @xmath24-shell nuclei @xcite , when near the proton drip line and/or near shell closure , have very small @xmath25-values for the radiative capture .",
    "thus the s - factor is dominated by single resonant and direct captures .",
    "consequently , the findings of this work have implications for a great number of today s interesting astrophysical cases .    in this paper",
    "we use an analytical / integral representation of the transition matrix element for the e1 process and impose the asymptotic approximation .",
    "following , we identify the physical ingredients that affect the low - energy behavior of capture reactions to loosely bound states . in section [ sect_1 ]",
    "the effect of the pole of @xmath26 at negative energy is specifically addressed .",
    "the threshold behavior is studied in section [ thresh ] .",
    "the competition between the remnant initial coulomb barrier , the final coulomb , the initial and final centrifugal barriers , as well as the trace of the singularity at @xmath16 are detailed and discussed .",
    "the s - factor dependence on the target charge is also studied .",
    "section [ application ] consists of an application to some important astrophysical capture processes . finally , in section [ summary ] , a summary of the results is presented .",
    "for e1 captures to loosely bound states , the reactions under consideration become purely peripheral and a simple solid sphere model is adequate . such an approach is also used when calculating the non - resonant capture in the r - matrix method @xcite .",
    "the s - factor for the capture from an initial state of @xmath27 with orbital angular momentum @xmath28 , to a final state @xmath29 of @xmath18 , with the angular orbital momentum @xmath30 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a factor depending on spin - angular characteristics , masses , charges and constants : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the tail of the projection of the bound state wave function of the final nucleus @xmath35 onto the two - body channel @xmath36p . the sommerfeld parameters for initial and final states , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are defined in terms of the initial relative momentum of @xmath27 , @xmath39 , and the bound state momentum , @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "this corresponds to neglecting the term containing the irregular coulomb function , @xmath57 .",
    "one should keep in mind that whenever precise values for @xmath58 are needed , phase shifts should be taken into account .",
