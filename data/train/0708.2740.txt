    "observations of co emission at large galactocentric distances have detected a number of molecular clouds , among which is edge cloud 2 ( hereafter ec2 ) , with an estimated kinematic galactocentric distance of @xmath4kpc @xcite .",
    "although this kinematic distance for the far - outer galaxy should be treated with caution , ec2 appeared to be up to 6kpc further away than edge cloud 1 ( ec1 ) , the next most distant molecular cloud detected by @xcite , and much further than the extent of the optical disk of the milky way , @xmath5  1519kpc @xcite .",
    "this is almost as far as the most distant hi , detected at @xmath5  30kpc @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite have traced the spiral structure in the southern half of the galaxy out to at least 25kpc , implying a minimum radius for the gas disk .",
    "ec2 has an effective radius of @xmath520 pc and is situated @xmath5350 pc below the distant warped galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the co luminosity of ec2 is at least a factor of 2 larger than those of the other 10 clouds detected at large distances , and is comparable to that of the taurus giant molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "ec2 is also the only edge cloud detected in the high - density tracer cs @xcite .",
    "the co maps of ec2 show that it has sub - structure .",
    "it is in a region of extremely low gas pressure and very small spiral arm perturbation .",
    "ec2 was also found to have an associated hii region excited by an early b star ( mr1 ) @xcite that appears to have triggered star formation .",
    "studies of metallicity as a function of galactocentric distance have shown that there is a galactic metallicity gradient .",
    "spectra of mr1 @xcite indicate significant metal depletion  with elemental abundances reduced on average by some 0.5 dex  and that its galactocentric distance is more likely to be in the range 15 - 19kpc ( placing it at the limit of the optical disk ) .",
    "subsequently , @xcite have calculated metal depletions of about five for c ,  n , and o. @xcite used nir observations to argue that mr1 has triggered the formation of young stellar objects in ec2 .",
    "@xcite argue that it is the most distant cloud in the milky way , with evidence for massive star formation , although this distinction is claimed for wb89 - 789 by @xcite .",
    "more recently , two embedded young star clusters have been associated with ec2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified 52 members in one of the clusters , suggesting that the cluster is a t tauri association .",
    "@xcite associate ec2 with the approaching side of the hi shell from supernova remnant ( snr ) gsh 1380194 , thereby setting the galactocentric distance @xmath6kpc for ec2 .",
    "because of the uncertainty of @xmath7 for ec2 , we have used two heliocentric distances , 14 and 20kpc ( @xmath8 and 28kpc ) for any distance sensitive calculations in this work .",
    "current models of galacto - chemical evolution include time and spatial variations in the halo gas infall and star formation rate whereby the galactic halo , bulge , and thick disk formed first , separately from the thin disk , in two infall episodes .",
    "chemical abundances of the interstellar medium and their radial variation across galactic disks provide a fundamental set of constraints for theories of disk formation and evolution . the most accepted mechanism to explain the existence of abundance gradients in disk galaxies is the so - called ` biased - infall ' @xcite , where infall of gas occurs at a faster rate in the innermost regions than in the outermost ones ( ` inside - out ' disk formation ) .",
    "growing observational evidence for slow formation of disks in spiral galaxies associated with continuing infall of primordial ( or low metallicity ) gas over the lifetime of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seems to give support to the above scenario .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that continuous infall of low - metallicity gas is occurring in the galactic center .",
    "of particular relevance to test these models are the abundances in the very outer galactic disks .",
    "chemical evolution models for abundance gradients and the formation of the milky way @xcite show that the steepness of the outer gradients are particularly sensitive to thresholds in star formation , to the halo - thick disk enrichment history , and to the radial variation of the disk formation timescales .",
    "they concluded that some abundance ratios increase substantially toward the outermost disk regions but that ` more observations at large galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions ' .",
    "the fact that n is almost constant with the galactocentric distance up to 18kpc @xcite reflects the high n production in agb stars .",
    "the primary n contribution from agb stars is however very uncertain . at such large galactocentric distances a n production threshold",
    "may be operating due to the paucity of late - type stars .",
    "galactic chemical evolution also predicts that the abundances of c , n , o , @xmath9c , and @xmath10n will be lower in clouds at the edge of the galaxy than in any other cloud of the galactic disk @xcite",
    ". the composition of these edge clouds should be similar to that of the early galactic disk modified by infall from the halo .",
    "thus the metallicity in clouds such as ec2 is expected to be similar to dwarf irregular galaxies , giving us an unique opportunity to study gas from the early stages of the formation of the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we have , therefore , searched for emission from a number of molecules towards ec2 , concentrating on the northern co peak ( which is coincident with the t tauri cluster identified by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to constrain its physical conditions and chemical composition .",
    "such molecular evolution in low metallicity galactic clouds also provides a local laboratory in understanding molecular gas in extragalactic sources such as high-@xmath11 quasars .",
    "in particular , since deuterated molecules are sensitive tracers of physical conditions and chemical pathways , we have also searched for a number of deuterium ( d ) bearing molecules , noting that @xcite have detected di towards the galactic anticenter .",
    "we also examine the role of snr gsh 1380194 in providing the energy input for both the chemistry and star formation observed in ec2 .",
    "we have completed over 210 hours of observations toward this object using the 12 m arizona radio observatory ( aro ) telescope ( formerly part of the national radio astronomy observatory ) , the 100 m max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ( mpifr ) effelsberg telescope , the 15 m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , and the 30 m institut de radio astronomie millimtrique ( iram ) telescope .",

    "our subsequent co maps centered on position e , ( @xmath18 , @xmath21 ) , covering the northern peak in emission , are also presented .",

    "<S> we calculate a gas temperature of 20k and a density of @xmath0@xmath1 . based on our co maps , we estimate the mass of ec2 at around @xmath2 and continuum observations suggest a dust - to - gas mass ratio as low as 0.001 . </S>",
    "<S> chemical models have been developed to reproduce the abundances in ec2 and they indicate that : heavy element abundances may be reduced by a factor of five relative to the solar neighbourhood ( similar to dwarf irregular galaxies and damped lyman alpha systems ) ; very low extinction ( @xmath3mag ) due to a very low dust - to - gas ratio ; an enhanced cosmic ray ionisation rate ; and a higher uv field compared to local interstellar values . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced abundances may be attributed to the low level of star formation in this region and are probably also related to the continuing infall of primordial ( or low metallicity ) halo gas since the milky way formed . </S>",
