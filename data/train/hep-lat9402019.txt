    "many years after its experimental observation , the proton spin crisis remains a puzzle @xcite for qcd to address .",
    "the problem may be stated as follows : consider the singlet axial current @xmath2 its on - shell nucleon matrix element has the form @xmath3 u(\\vec{p}\\,',e ' ) \\label{jmatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 label the helicity states and @xmath5 is the momentum transfer . in a naive wave function picture @xmath6",
    "can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quarks .",
    "experimental determinations lead to an unexpectedly small value of @xmath6 , calling for a theoretical explanation in the context of qcd .    in the chiral limit , @xmath7 is not conserved ; its anomalous divergence is proportional to the topological charge density , @xmath8 one has @xmath9 where @xmath10 and , therefore , @xmath11 .",
    "finding @xmath6 thus reduces to a calculation of the proton matrix elements of @xmath12 .    for a determination of this nonperturbative matrix element",
    ", we turn to the lattice .",
    "to proceed , we need a ( lattice-)regularized version of @xmath12 , for example @xcite : @xmath13 \\label{q^l}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the product of link variables around a plaquette . as with any regularized operator , the correct approach to the continuum requires a proper renormalization .",
    "a consideration of the quantum numbers of @xmath15 leads to the following simple form @xcite : @xmath16 a precise determination of @xmath17 is a prerequisite for the calculation of the hadronic matrix element .    using the numerical ( heating ) method described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we evaluate @xmath18 without any recourse to perturbation theory .",
    "subsequently , an estimate of @xmath6 is obtained by measuring the matrix element @xmath19 on the lattice , using wilson fermions in the quenched approximation .",
    "we should also mention two earlier investigations of this issue : ref .",
    "@xcite estimates @xmath6 in a quenched calculation ; the result quoted there must be corrected by renormalization effects of the lattice topological charge density . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simulation of unquenched staggered fermions is performed , using the `` geometrical '' topological charge density .",
    "we determine @xmath17 nonperturbatively by a method described in refs .",
    "@xcite . the method relies on the fact that @xmath18 is produced by short ranged quantum fluctuations , and therefore should not suffer from critical slowing down , unlike `` global '' quantities , such as the topological charge .",
    "we start from a configuration @xmath20 which is an approximate minimum of the lattice action and carries a definite topological charge @xmath21 ( typically @xmath22 ) .",
    "we construct ensembles @xmath23 made out of independent configurations obtained by heating ( i.e. updating by a local algorithm ) the starting configuration @xmath20 , at a given @xmath24 , for the same number @xmath25 of updating steps , and average the topological charge over @xmath23 at fixed @xmath25 .",
    "plotting @xmath26 averaged over @xmath23 as a function of @xmath25 , we should see first a decrease of the signal , originated by the onset of @xmath18 during thermalization of the short - ranged modes , followed by a plateau .",
    "the average of @xmath27 over plateau configurations should be equal to @xmath28 .    on a @xmath29 lattice we constructed an approximate instanton configuration",
    "whose charge is @xmath30 .",
    "heating was performed using a 10-hit metropolis algorithm ( tuned to 50% acceptance ) at @xmath31 , and collecting about 4500 heating trajectories . in fig .",
    "[ zeta - plot ] we plot @xmath32 .",
    "we see clearly a plateau starting from @xmath33 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 at the plateau gives an estimate of @xmath18 : @xmath35 in order to check the stability of the background topological structure of the initial configuration , after the heating procedure we cool the configurations , by locally minimizing the action ; we find @xmath36 after a few cooling steps .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath6 we performed monte carlo simulations in the quenched approximation using wilson fermions . in terms of the proton annihilation operator @xmath37u^a_\\alpha$ ] and its fourier transform @xmath38 , we should have @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the helicity projection operator and its eigenvalue .",
    "given that , with the wilson fermion discretization , the state of opposite parity propagates backward in time , we must keep @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the temporal size of the lattice , in order to isolate the proton state .",
    "then @xmath46 can be obtained extrapolating to @xmath47 the following relationship @xmath48 when @xmath49 . in practice ,",
    "since in a finite lattice we can not reach @xmath47 , the smallest available nonzero momentum @xmath50 can be used to estimate @xmath51 .",
    "our measurements were performed on a sample of about 100 configurations generated on a @xmath52 lattice at @xmath31 .",
    "we computed the wilson fermion propagator using the smearing technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite : we fixed the coulomb gauge and used a delta function localized on a @xmath53 cube in the dirac equation .",
    "we considered the following values of the hopping parameter : @xmath54 .",
    "while the above bound is not stringent enough for a comparison with experimental data , the situation is actually quite promising : a higher statistics calculation is called for , and we are currently undertaking it on an ape / quadrics dedicated machine . also , an improved lattice topological charge density operator ( less noisy or with @xmath17 closer to one ) would be welcome .",
    "finally , an obvious further question to address is the effect of unquenched fermions",
    ". we will be reporting on these issues in future publications ."
