    "nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) encode the modifications to free nucleon parton distributions due to the complex , many - body environment in the nucleus .",
    "they are essential in the application of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) to the description of many relevant observables in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "most of the currently available npdfs @xcite have been obtained from global fits to diverse experimental data .",
    "these npdfs from global fits are homogeneous ( independent of impact parameter ) , and are thus functions of the bjorken variable @xmath0 and squared momentum transferred @xmath2 .",
    "an exception is @xcite which is based on the gribov theory @xcite and available in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous forms .",
    "experimental data on nucleus - nucleus collisions are often presented in terms of centrality classes .",
    "these classes can be mapped into corresponding intervals in impact parameter space using the glauber formalism . in order to adequately describe these data , inhomogeneous ( impact - parameter - dependent )",
    "parton distributions are required . due to the inherent constraints in the determination of npdfs , especially in the gluon sector , it is pragmatic not to be limited in the choice of npdf sets .",
    "thus in order to take advantage of the different sets available , there is need for phenomenologically robust and realistic prescriptions for generating inhomogeneous npdfs .",
    "this is usually carried out by convolution of impact parameter distributions with homogeneous npdfs .",
    "one such prescription is given in @xcite where two variants of impact parameter distributions are considered .",
    "the first variant assumes the distribution is proportional to the local nuclear density ( generally taken as a wood - saxon nuclear density ) .",
    "the second takes the distribution as proportional to the nuclear path length ( glauber thickness function ) .",
    "a simpler distribution is used in @xcite where a hard sphere dependence is assumed .",
    "our objective in this study is to model impact parameter distributions which can be used with the homogeneous npdfs in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to determine the impact parameter distributions which give a good description of the nuclear shadowing ratio in the region of small bjorken @xmath0 .",
    "these distributions are then applied in conjunction with a homogeneous npdf set to calculate the centrality dependence of some observables in deuteron - gold collisions .",
    "a major simplification underlying the application is the assumption that the distributions derived from small-@xmath0 shadowing are applicable to modifications at all values of @xmath0 . as in @xcite",
    "we employ a generalized form of the gribov theory , incorporating the real part of the diffractive scattering amplitude .",
    "experimental data for nuclear shadowing at small @xmath0 are available from the nmc@xcite and e665@xcite experiments .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "in nuclei , for small values of the bjorken variable @xmath0 ( @xmath7 ) , the nuclear structure functions @xmath8 are significantly reduced compared to the product of the mass number @xmath9 and the free nucleon structure function @xmath10 .",
    "since the virtual photon - nucleus cross section is proportional to @xmath11 , then equivalently the virtual photon - nucleus cross section is less than @xmath9 times the one for free nucleons , @xmath12 .",
    "this phenomenon is generally known as nuclear shadowing in the strict sense .",
    "similar behavior is observed for real photons at sufficiently high energies ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus the nuclear shadowing ratio , defined as @xmath14 or alternatively as @xmath15 , is less than unity .",
    "the ( virtual ) photon - nucleus cross section is separable into a part which accounts for the incoherent scattering from individual nucleons , and a correction ( shadowing correction ) from the coherent interaction with several nucleons : @xmath16 the single scattering part is the incoherent sum of photon - nucleon cross sections , where @xmath17 is the nuclear charge number , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the photon - proton and photon - neutron cross sections , respectively .",
    "the multiple scattering correction is expressible as an expansion in the number of nucleons in the target involved in the coherent scattering ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the dominant contribution to nuclear shadowing comes from double scattering , since the probability that the propagating hadronic excitation coherently interacts with several nucleons decreases with the number of nucleons .",
    "we define the shadowing ratio as ^s_a = we neglect the small difference between the photon - proton cross section @xmath21 and the photon - neutron cross section @xmath22 in this study , and thus denote by @xmath23 the generic photon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the shadowing ratio can thus be written as [ eq : sr ] r^s_a = 1 + thus , the evaluation of the shadowing correction , @xmath24 , is central to the calculation of the shadowing ratio . in the next section",
    "we utilize the gribov theory in a generalized form to determine @xmath24 .",
    "the original formulation of gribov is generalized by including the real part of the diffractive scattering amplitude .",

    "the hadronic excitation is assumed to propagate at fixed impact parameter @xmath32 and to interact with a second nucleon at @xmath33 .",

    "( [ eq : ds_a ] ) implies that only diffractively excited hadrons with a longitudinal propagation length larger than the average nucleon - nucleon distance in the target , @xmath37 , can contribute significantly to double scattering .",
    "the limits of integration define the kinematically permitted range of diffractive excitations , with their invariant mass @xmath38 above the two - pion production threshold and limited by the center - of - mass energy @xmath39 of the scattering process .",
    "we approximate the two - body density @xmath34 by a product of one - body densities @xmath40 since short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations are relevant in nuclei only when @xmath41 is comparable to the range of the short - range repulsive part of the nucleon - nucleon force , i.e. for distances @xmath42 .",
    "however , shadowing is negligible in this case and therefore short - range correlations are not important in the shadowing domain .    with increasing photon energies or decreasing @xmath0 down to @xmath43 , the longitudinal propagation length of diffractively excited hadrons rises and eventually reaches nuclear dimensions .",

    "relevant model parameters are taken from experiments and earlier studies .",
    "the calculated result for the shadowing ratio agrees nicely with small @xmath0 shadowing data from the e665 experiment and also reproduces quite well the trend of shadowing with mass number @xmath9 .",
    "we compare the resultant impact parameter profiles for four representative nuclei with the glauber thickness function dependence which has been previously applied in the literature .",
    "we also present the profiles as a function of both mass number a and impact parameter b for @xmath183 and @xmath185 fm .",
    "we illustrate the utility of the impact parameter distributions by applying them to calculate the centrality dependence of three different observables in deuteron - gold collisions : the @xmath128 nuclear modification factor @xmath129 , pseudorapidity asymmetry @xmath130 for pions and protons , and the hadron - to - pion ratio , @xmath181 . except for the overshoot at the most central class",
    ", our calculation gives an adequate description of the centrality behavior of both @xmath129 and @xmath181 as measured by the phenix collaboration .",
    "the agreement with the star data for the centrality dependence of pseudorapidity asymmetry is also good for both pions and protons .",
    "this is encouraging considering the fact that the distributions have been derived from the small-@xmath0 shadowing ratio , and thus in a strict sense reflects the behavior in the shadowing region , i.e @xmath186 .",
