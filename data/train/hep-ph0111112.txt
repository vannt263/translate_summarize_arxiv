    "i reviewed a recent comparison of the predicted spectrum from z - bursts  resulting from the resonant annihilation of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos with relic neutrinos  with the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the heaviest relic neutrino turned out to be @xmath131 ev for halo- and @xmath132  ev for extragalactic - scenarios for the background protons .",
    "the second mass , with a lower bound of @xmath111 ev on the 95% cl , is compatible with a hierarchical neutrino mass scenario with the largest mass suggested by the atmospheric neutrino oscillation .",
    "the above neutrino masses are in the range which can be explored by future laboratory experiments like the @xmath133 decay endpoint spectrum and the neutrinoless @xmath134 decay  @xcite or by simultaneous observations of the bursts of neutrinos and gravitational waves emitted during a stellar collapse  @xcite .",
    "they compare also favourably with the upper limit @xmath135 ev found recently from a global cosmological analysis involving also the recent cmbr measurements  @xcite , with a future sensitivity down to @xmath136 ev  @xcite .",
    "we analysed a possible two - mass scenario and gave the corresponding confidence level region .",
    "the necessary uhec@xmath4 flux was found to be consistent with present upper limits and detectable in the near future .",
    "astrophysical sources of these ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos should be hidden even in @xmath117 rays .",
