    "the main goal of the mission is to characterize extra - solar planets , particularly planets of roughly earth - size in the habitable zone .",
    "this is done through photometric detection of transits of a planet in front of the host star .",

    "further details on the spacecraft and mission were provided by @xcite .",
    "the mission was launched in march 2009 and has been spectacularly successful",
    ". amongst the remarkable results have been the statistics of a large number of exo - planet candidates @xcite , the detection of the first confirmed rocky exo - planet @xcite and the detection of a system with 6 planets , with masses determined from the planet - planet interactions @xcite .",
    "the photometric requirements of the detection of the transit of an earth - size planet in front of a star like the sun , with a reduction in intensity of around @xmath2 , make the mission ideally suited for asteroseismology .",

    "as a background for the discussion of individual types of stars below , it is probably useful to provide a brief overview of the properties of stellar oscillations .",
    "more detailed expositions have been provided , for example , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider only small - amplitude adiabatic oscillations of spherically symmetric stars .",
    "the dependence of a mode of oscillation on co - latitude @xmath3 and longitude @xmath4 can be written as a spherical harmonic @xmath5 , where the degree @xmath6 provides a measure of the total number of nodal lines on the stellar surface and the azimuthal order @xmath7 measures the number of nodal lines crossing the equator . in the absence of rotation and other departures from spherical symmetry the frequencies are independent of @xmath7 . from a physical point of view",
    "there are two dominant restoring forces at work : pressure perturbations and gravity working on density perturbations .",
    "the former case dominates in acoustic waves and leads to modes of oscillation characterized as p modes , while the latter corresponds to internal gravity waves and leads to modes characterized as g modes .",
    "a very good understanding of the properties of the modes can be obtained from simple asymptotic analysis which in fact turns out to have surprisingly broad applicability in the study of asteroseismically interesting stars . by generalizing an analysis by @xcite",
    ", @xcite showed that the oscillations approximately satisfy @xmath8 here @xmath9 is distance to the centre and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the displacement vector , @xmath12 is the adiabatic sound speed and @xmath13 is density .",
    "also @xmath14 \\ ; , \\label{eq : kasymp}\\ ] ] @xmath15 being the frequency of oscillation , is determined by three characteristic frequencies of the star : the _ lamb frequency _ @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the _ buoyancy frequency _ ( or _ brunt - visl frequency _ ) @xmath18 , to convective instability : in convectively unstable regions @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the local gravitational acceleration , and the _ acoustic cut - off frequency _ @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the density scale height .",
    "the properties of a mode are largely determined by the regions in the star where the eigenfunction oscillates as a function of @xmath9 , i.e. , where @xmath25 . in regions where @xmath26 the eigenfunction locally increases or decreases exponentially with @xmath9",
    ". there may be several oscillatory regions , but typically the amplitude is substantially larger in one of these than in the rest , defining the region where the mode is said to be trapped .",
    "the acoustic cut - off frequency is generally large near the stellar surface and small in the interior . for the low - degree modes relevant here the term in @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kasymp ] ) is small near the surface , and the properties of the oscillations are determined by the magnitude of @xmath15 relative to the atmospheric value of @xmath22 : when @xmath15 is less than @xmath22 the eigenfunction decreases exponentially in the atmosphere , and the mode is trapped in the stellar interior ; otherwise , the mode is strongly damped by the loss of energy through running waves in the atmosphere .",
    "the properties of the oscillations in the stellar interior are controlled by the behaviour of @xmath16 and @xmath18 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : charfreq ] ) . in unevolved stars",
    "@xmath18 is typically small compared with the characteristic frequencies of p modes . for these , therefore , @xmath28 ( neglecting @xmath22 ) , and the modes are trapped in the region where @xmath29 in the outer parts of the star , with a lower turning point , @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 at low degree the cyclic frequencies of p modes approximately satisfy @xmath32 @xcite ; here @xmath33 is the radial order of the mode , @xmath34 is the inverse sound travel time across a stellar diameter , @xmath35 being the surface radius , @xmath36 is a frequency - dependent phase that reflects the behaviour of @xmath22 near the stellar surface and @xmath37 is a small correction that in main - sequence stars predominantly depends on the sound - speed gradient in the stellar core . on the other hand , g modes have frequencies below @xmath18 and typically such that @xmath38 in the relevant part of the star ; in this case the modes are trapped in a region defined by @xmath39 . here",
    "the oscillation _ periods _ satisfy a simple asymptotic relation : @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath41 is a phase and @xmath42 the integral being over the region where the modes are trapped .    as discussed in section  [ sec : redgiant ] ( see also bedding , these proceedings ) the situation is considerably more complicated in evolved stars with a compact core ; this leads to a high value of @xmath21 and hence @xmath18 in the interior of the star , such that modes may have a g - mode character in the deep interior , and a p - mode character in the outer , parts of the star .",
    "mixed modes _ have a very substantial diagnostic potential .",
    "the solar oscillations are most likely intrinsically damped @xcite and excited stochastically by the turbulent near - surface convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus such oscillations can be expected in all stars with significant outer convection zones @xcite .",
    "an interesting example is the very recent detection , based on _ kepler _ data , of solar - like oscillations in a @xmath43 scuti star @xcite .",
    "the combination of damping and excitation leads to a well - defined , bell - shaped envelope of power with a maximum at a cyclic frequency @xmath44 which approximately scales as the acoustic cut - off frequency @xmath22 in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "assuming adiabatic oscillations in an isothermal atmosphere , this yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass , and @xmath47 the effective temperature , of the star .",
    "this scaling has substantial observational support ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it is still not fully understood from a theoretical point of view ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for stars on or near the main sequence",
    "the frequencies approximately satisfy the asymptotic relation ( [ eq : pasymp ] ) . here",
    "the large frequency separation roughly scales , in accordance with homology scaling , as the square root of the mean stellar density , i.e. , @xmath48 although with some departures from strict homology that largely depend on @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the observational properties of solar - like oscillations was provided by @xcite .    in the early phases of the _ kepler _ project a survey of potential asteroseismic targets",
    "was carried out , each typically observed for one month .",
    "this led to the detection of a huge number of main - sequence and subgiant stars showing solar - like oscillations , increasing the number of the known cases by more than a factor of 20 , relative to earlier ground - based observations and the observations with the corot mission .",
    "as discussed by @xcite this provides information about basic stellar properties , through the application of the scaling laws for @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( eqs  [ eq : numax ] and [ eq : dnuscale ] ) , yielding a very interesting overview of the distribution , in mass and radius , of stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these extensive data also allow a calibration of scaling relations that can be used to predict the detectability of solar - like oscillations for a given star @xcite ; this is important for the scheduling of further _ kepler _ observations and will , suitably generalized , be very valuable for the definition of other observing campaigns .    a selected set of these stars are now being observed for much longer , to improve the precision and level of detail of the observed frequencies and hence allow detailed characterization of the stellar properties and internal structure , through fits to the individual observed frequencies .",
    "interesting examples of such analyses were carried out by @xcite and @xcite ( see also di mauro et al . , these proceedings ) , in both cases for stars evolved somewhat beyond the main sequence where modes of mixed p- and g - mode character provided more sensitive information about the stellar properties ( see also bedding , these proceedings ) . a very interesting analysis of the diagnostic potentials of mixed modes , based on corot observations , was presented by @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the asteroseismology of solar - like stars is the application to stars found by _",
    "kepler _ to be planet hosts . here",
    "the analysis allows the precise determination of the stellar mass and radius , essential for characterizing the properties of the planets detected through the transit technique and follow - up radial velocity measurements , and determination of the stellar age through model fits to the observed frequencies provides a measure of the age of the planetary system .",
    "an early example of such analyses , for the previously known planet host hat - p-7 , was provided by @xcite , and asteroseismic results were important for the characterization of the first rocky planet detected outside the solar system , kepler-10b @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most striking aspect of _ kepler _ asteroseismology has been the study of solar - like oscillations in red - giants stars .",
    "these have evolved beyond the phase of central hydrogen burning , developing a helium core surrounded by a thin region , the hydrogen - burning shell , providing the energy output of the star .",
    "the core contracts while the outer layers expand greatly , accompanied by a reduction of the effective temperature , until the star reaches and evolves up the hayashi track , at nearly constant @xmath47 . at the tip of the red - giant branch the temperature in the core reaches around 100mk , enough to start efficient helium burning .",
    "helium ignition is followed by a readjustment of the internal structure , leading to some reduction in the surface radius , and maintaining the hydrogen - burning shell as a substantial contributor to the total energy output of the star .",
    "this central helium - burning phase is rather long - lived , with the stars changing relatively little ; in stellar clusters this leads to an accumulation of stars in this phase , which is therefore known as the ` clump phase ' .     for @xmath51 ( dashed line ) and buoyancy frequency @xmath18 ( solid line ) , against fractional radius , in a @xmath52 red - giant model with heavy - element abundance @xmath53 , radius @xmath54 and luminosity @xmath55 .",

    "[ fig : charfreq ] for a typical red - giant model .",
    "as is clear from the behaviour of the buoyancy frequency @xmath18 , the outer convective envelope extends over more than 90 % of the stellar radius .",
    "the border of the helium core , with a mass of @xmath59 , is marked by the small local maximum in @xmath18 near @xmath60 ; the large mass within a small region leads to a very large local gravitational acceleration , causing the huge buoyancy frequency ( cf .",

    ", the mode behaves as a p mode in the region outside @xmath61 , marking the bottom of the outer acoustic cavity , and as a g mode inside @xmath62 .",
    "this causes a mixed character of the modes ( see also bedding , these proceedings ) .",
    "early predictions of solar - like oscillations in red giants were made by @xcite .",
    "this was followed by detections in ground - based observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( [ eq : fulldisps ] ) as @xmath140 where ( assuming again @xmath123 ) @xmath141 and @xmath142 satisfies @xmath143 it is obvious that the eigenfrequencies satisfy @xmath144 for integer @xmath33 .",

    "[ fig : asperspac1]a ; except near acoustic resonances , where @xmath145 for integer @xmath113 , @xmath139 is almost constant and the period spacing is determined by the first term in @xmath146 , essentially corresponding to the pure g - mode case defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pureg ] ) . near the acoustic resonances",
    "@xmath139 changes rapidly , causing a strong variation in the period spacing .",
    "this behaviour can be made more precise by noting that the frequency spacing between adjacent modes approximately satisfies @xmath147 and hence the period spacing is , approximately , given by @xmath148 here the numerator is the period spacing for pure g modes , and the denominator causes a reduction in @xmath69 near an acoustic resonance .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "( [ eq : asperspac ] ) .    at the centre of an acoustic resonance @xmath149 and @xmath150 , up to an irrelevant multiple of @xmath151 . in the vicinity of this point",
    "we can expand @xmath139 as @xmath152 in terms of @xmath153 , to obtain @xmath154 and hence the period spacing @xmath155 this approximation is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asperspac1]b .",
    "in particular , we obtain the minimum period spacing @xmath156 it is interesting that the maximum reduction in the period spacing increases with decreasing @xmath130 and hence weaker coupling . on the other hand",
    ", the width of the decrease in @xmath69 also decreases and so therefore do the chances of finding a g mode in the vicinity of the minimum .",
    "although the present analysis is highly simplified ( and consequently quite simple ) , it does appear to capture many of the aspects of the numerical solutions for stellar models .",
    "it would probably not be difficult to generalize it to take the behaviour near the turning points properly into account , making reasonable a more detailed comparison with the numerical results . a comparison with the behaviour of the mode inertia ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inertia ] ) would similarly have been interesting .",
    "such efforts are beyond the scope of the present paper , however .",
    "i also note that there is clearly some symmetry between the treatment of the g- and p - dominated modes in how the frequency - dependent phase function @xmath139 is introduced . in the present case , with a dense spectrum of g modes undergoing avoided crossings with a smaller number of p modes",
    ", it was natural to regard the effect of the latter as a modification , in terms of @xmath139 , to the dispersion relation for the former . for subgiants , on the other hand , with a comparatively dense spectrum of p modes and few g modes ,",
    "a similar phase could be introduced in the p - mode dispersion relation .",
    "this might be interesting in connection with the analysis presented by bedding ( these proceedings ) .",
    "it is obvious that _ kepler _ has already been an overwhelming success , resulting in observations that will be analysed for years to come .",
    "even so , it is crucial to ensure that the mission continues beyond the nominal end in late 2012 . for the exo - planet research",
    "this is required to reach the planned sensitivity to earth - like planets , given a stellar background noise that has been found to be somewhat higher than expected . for asteroseismology",
    "the gains will be numerous .",
    "a longer mission will allow further searches for rare types of oscillating stars , exemplified by the recent detection in the _ kepler _ field of an oscillating white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the possibilities for detecting frequency variations associated with stellar cycles in solar - like stars @xcite will be much improved .",
    "also , longer timeseries will allow reaching further peaks , for modes with longer lifetimes , in the dipolar forests in red giants and hence greatly strengthen the possibilities for investigating the properties of their cores .",
    "however , there is clearly a need to consider observational facilities beyond _",
    "the proposed esa plato mission @xcite for transit search for exo - planets would allow asteroseismic characterization of a large fraction of the stars where planet systems are detected ; in addition , it would cover a much larger area on the sky than _ kepler _ , and hence provide a greater variety of asteroseismic targets . also , ground - based observations of stellar oscillations in radial velocity still present great advantages over the photometric observations by _",
    "kepler_. this is particularly important for solar - like stars , where the ` noise ' from other processes in the stellar atmosphere provides a background that is much higher , relative to the oscillations , in intensity than in doppler velocity @xcite .",
    "this is the background for establishing the song network @xcite of one meter telescopes , with a distribution to ensure almost continuous observations anywhere in the sky .",
    "the first node in the network , built largely with danish funding , will start operations in 2012 , a chinese node is under construction , and partners are being sought to establish additional nodes .",
    "i wish to express my deep sympathy with the japanese people for the losses sustained in the disaster immediately preceding this conference .",
