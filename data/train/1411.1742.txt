    "the theory of singular fibrations of @xmath2-manifolds for @xmath3 has seen its share of applications in low - dimensional topology .",
    "for instance morse functions , open books and lefschetz fibrations all lead to depictions of 3- and 4-manifolds using surfaces ( which are regular fibers ) decorated with circles , and such discrete information has been a rich playground . though its definitions go at least as far back as catastrophe theory , the morse 2-function as a fibration structure is a promising invention of @xcite that has seen some recent nontrivial development @xcite .",
    "an _ indefinite morse 2-function _ is a smooth map @xmath4 from an @xmath2-manifold @xmath0 to a 2-manifold @xmath1 such that each critical point has the local model of an index @xmath5 _ indefinite fold _ or an index @xmath5 _ indefinite cusp _ , given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the local models for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( the _ definite _ fold and cusp ) are omitted , though theorem  [ isotthm ] could be easily adapted to handle those critical points as well .",
    "the reason for this is the definite locus can be eliminated from smooth maps when @xmath10 by homotopy ( see for example the earliest proof of this fact in @xcite ) , and there are general existence results for indefinite one - parameter families of maps when @xmath11 @xcite .    to help understand folds and cusps , figure  [ crit ] shows two disks in @xmath1 , schematically depicting the fibration structure near a fold and a cusp for @xmath10 .",
    "bold arcs represent the image of the critical locus and a surface is pictured in the region of regular values that have that surface as their preimage .",
    "tracing point preimages above a horizontal arc from left to right gives the foliation of @xmath12 by hyperboloids , with a double cone above the fold point .",
    "the circle ( drawn on the cylinder to the left ) that shrinks to the cone point is called the _ vanishing cycle _ for that critical arc .",
    "each cusp point is a common endpoint of two open arcs of fold points for which the two vanishing cycles must transversely intersect at a unique point in the fiber .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed background on these maps .",
    "the main point of this paper is the complete characterization of when a proposed movement in the critical image of a wrinkled fibration , similar to a sequence of reidemeister moves for knot projections , can be achieved by a deformation .",

    "the problem is to determine when there is a deformation @xmath18 such that the image of each point @xmath19 in this fold arc follows the path @xmath20 while the rest of the critical image remains fixed .",
    "theorem  [ isotthm ] gives a necessary and sufficient criterion for this to occur , and the following propositions present a few standard cases in which a proposed 2-parameter crossing always exists .",
    "many of those propositions may generalize to @xmath21 ; the restriction to @xmath10 is due to the nonzero number of applications anticipated by the author .",

    "then there exists an @xmath61 deformation as suggested by the figure .    the typical approach for",
    "a statement like assertion  ( ) will be to show that there is a choice of horizontal distribution such that @xmath64 .",
    "first , note that @xmath37 must either lie on the lower - genus side of at least one fold arc which we will call @xmath65 ( case ( a ) ) , or on the higher - genus side of both ( case ( b ) ) . in either case , the deformation exists if and only if there is a vertical arc @xmath66 connecting the two fold arcs that is disjoint from @xmath67 , because in that case one could shrink @xmath17 so that its interior is a tubular neighborhood of @xmath68 whose preimage satisfies the disjointness condition .    for case ( ) , @xmath58 is 1-dimensional if @xmath37 lies on the lower - genus side of exactly one of the fold arcs , and by remark  [ vertarcs ] it maps to a disjoint union of vertical arcs in @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath37 lies on the lower - genus side of both of the fold arcs then @xmath58 is @xmath69-dimensional , the intersection of two surfaces in @xmath70 .",
    "however , remark  [ vertarcs ] implies the dimension of @xmath58 is at least 1 , for any @xmath33 . for this reason",
    ", @xmath58 must be empty in this case .",
    "[ digr]if the previous paragraph sounds strange , here is a digression , giving another way to explain its conclusion : any arc in @xmath58 is simultaneously the cocore of a three - dimensional 2-handle and the core of a 3-dimensional 1-handle , which is not only non - generic in the space of morse functions because it is not morse - smale , but is also non - generic in the space of one - parameter families of morse functions ( parameterized by the horizontal direction @xmath71 in figure  [ finger ] ) : over any horizontal line @xmath72 , the pairs of points that run into the top and bottom fold arcs trace paths in the 3-manifold @xmath73fiber@xmath74 , and an arc in @xmath58 is an arc of intersections between these paths .",
    "given such an arc @xmath75 , one merely perturbs @xmath33 so that the @xmath71-value at which one pair of paths crosses @xmath76 is different than the @xmath71-value for the other , and this can be achieved all along @xmath76 by performing essentially the same perturbation crossed with @xmath76 .",
    "this concludes the digression .    in either case , the dimension of @xmath58 is no greater than 1 , so there is at least one vertical arc in @xmath17 whose preimage in @xmath26 is disjoint from @xmath27 , and so this arc has a neighborhood whose preimage in @xmath26 is disjoint from @xmath27 , and we perform the finger move in this neighborhood .    for case ( ) , the assumption is that @xmath64 in the fiber above @xmath37 . in the language handlebodies",
    ", we have a three - dimensional 1-handle attachment followed by a 2-handle attached along a circle that can up to isotopy is disjoint from the belt circle of the 1-handle .",
    "in this case , it is also known that the order of handle attachment can be switched by a homotopy of the corresponding morse function , then un - switched , which similarly gives the suggested @xmath61 deformation .    for the ( @xmath77 ) part of assertion  ( ) , assume the fiber above @xmath37 is connected , since the result obviously holds if the vanishing cycles of the two fold arcs , as measured from @xmath63 , lie in different fiber components .",
    "denote by @xmath78 the generic fiber over @xmath63 and @xmath79 the fiber over @xmath37 .",
    "also , denote by @xmath80 the pair of points in @xmath79 corresponding to the fold arc not containing @xmath31 , again assumed to be stationary .",
    "because of the matching vanishing cycles , it makes sense to talk about a single vanishing cycle @xmath68 of the fold arc containing @xmath31 that lives in @xmath78 , measured near either end of @xmath81 ( and also in @xmath79 for those points actually in @xmath81 ) .",
    "choosing small @xmath82 , the representatives of @xmath68 as measured at @xmath83 are isotopic in @xmath84 because they are isotopic in @xmath78 .",
    "the surface @xmath85 has free fundamental group , in which elements whose representatives differ by crossing @xmath80 are distinct .",
    "this implies that each crossing of @xmath68 over @xmath86 or @xmath87 ( that is , each point in @xmath58 , which is generically a 1-submanifold of @xmath0 ) is accompanied by a canceling crossing ( paired , say , by letting the endpoints of reference paths travel along horizontal lines across the central lune to get one - parameter families of points and vanishing cycles in @xmath79 ) .",
    "this allows the disjointness condition to be satisfied by a homotopy of @xmath33 that cancels the crossings by identifying vertical arcs in @xmath17 in pairs .",
    "the ( @xmath88 ) part of assertion  ( ) is clear ; see example  [ r2prop(3)nonex ] for a few examples .    for assertion ( ) , after moving all cusps into the higher - genus sides of the two folds , the proof of the analogous case of assertion ( ) ( the last two sentences above remark  [ digr ] ) goes through word - for - word .",
    "now for assertion ( ) . if @xmath26 and @xmath27 have no intersections above the lune @xmath89 bounded by the fold arcs , then it is possible to choose @xmath17 small enough to make @xmath64 .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath26 and @xmath27 intersect transversely , and let @xmath90 . since all fibers are connected , the two vanishing cycles as measured at @xmath37 using the reference paths @xmath91 are homologically distinct and disjoint for all @xmath37 sufficiently close to the fold crossings . in this situation , any point of intersection between @xmath26 and @xmath27 is reflected by an intersection between the vanishing cycles in the fiber using vertical reference paths , and this point is one of a pair that forms the corners of a family of lunes , one in in each fiber , each of whose boundary is a pair of arcs , one in each of the two vanishing cycles . by a homotopy of @xmath33 ,",
    "these lunes can be simultaneously contracted , eliminating the intersections of @xmath26 and @xmath27 from @xmath92 .",
    "now the proposition follows from theorem  [ isotthm ] .",
    "the proof of this result is just the same as that of proposition  [ r2prop ] ( ) , except that @xmath26 , instead of being a pair of embedded disks given by the fiberwise feet of a 3-dimensional 1-handle , is an immersed pair of disks whose immersion locus is an arc of double points limiting to the cusp , and the argument applies after perturbing @xmath33 to eliminate intersections between @xmath26 and @xmath27 along this arc similarly to remark  [ digr ] .",
    "[ r2prop(3)nonex]here are a few examples illustrating subtleties surrounding proposition  [ r2prop ] .",
    "suppose that above @xmath93 there is an arc of intersection between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the vanishing cycle of @xmath31 crosses once over one of the points that runs into the other fold arc , traveling along the reference path @xmath94 .",
    "then up to isotopy the two vanishing cycles mentioned in proposition  [ r2prop ] differ by sliding over a disk bounded by the other fold arc s vanishing cycle , so that the @xmath61 deformation would result in the particular impossibility that validates the ( @xmath88 ) part of the statement : @xmath31 would be free of intersection points with other folds and have vanishing cycles at either end that are not isotopic in the fiber above @xmath63 .",
    "another more subtle problem occurs when the regular fiber over the lune is a torus or a sphere . in this case",
    ", there can be many vertical arcs in @xmath95 in which the vanishing cycle crosses one of the points with the same orientation ( think of a meridian of a torus traveling around and around the torus , repeatedly crossing some marked point ) . unlike the previous example",
    ", the vanishing cycles of @xmath31 at @xmath62 can match , and the base diagram one might expect from such a move might not have obvious inconsistencies , but the proposed movement of fold arcs in the base is still not valid by theorem  [ isotthm ] .    in all these cases , @xmath58 is generically 1-dimensional : over every vertical arc ( oriented downward ) in @xmath17 the morse function corresponds to a pair of consecutive 3-dimensional 2-handle attachments , and every point of @xmath58 is an intersection between the cocore of the first 2-handle ( 1-dimensional in each arc , sweeping out a 2-dimensional subset of @xmath96 ) and the core of the second ( 2-dimensional in each arc , sweeping out a 3-dimensional subset of @xmath96 ) .",
    "certainly there is no way to switch the order of handle attachments while keeping the intersection between core and cocore inside the lune , and ( as the first example shows ) there is no general way to move a vertical arc of intersections out of @xmath17 by a homotopy .",
    "figure  [ triangle ] depicts the closure @xmath17 of a neighborhood of a triangle of fold arcs .",
    "foliate @xmath17 by a family of vertical paths , each of which can be considered the target of a member of a one - parameter family of morse functions .",
    "there are four cases , according to the number @xmath2 of fold arcs that have the central triangle on their lower - genus sides . in all cases ,",
    "the restriction of the map to the preimage of each leaf is a morse function with three critical points and two or three critical values .",
    "the depicted @xmath97 deformation can be thought of as affecting the vertical order of the critical values of these morse functions in various ways .",
    "for any @xmath97 deformation , we let the disk @xmath17 be the closure of a regular neighborhood of the triangle formed by the three fold arcs , with @xmath98 coinciding with @xmath65 . since the fiber is connected with genus at least 2 over every regular value , the vanishing cycles of any one of the three folds as measured by different reference paths from the some arbitrarily chosen point can be assumed to be equal by appropriate choice of horizontal distribution , not just isotopic .",
    "example  [ r3ex ] shows why this is a necessary assumption .",
    "the case @xmath99 can be satisfied as in proposition  [ r2prop ] ( ) : though they would be intersections between two surfaces in a 4-manifold , intersections between the ascending manifold of @xmath65 and the descending manifold of @xmath1 or @xmath100 are not generic .",
    "for @xmath101 , without loss of generality suppose the triangle is on the higher - genus side of @xmath1 and the lower genus sides of @xmath65 and @xmath100 .",
    "as in the paragraph above proposition  [ r3prop ] , generically the intersection between the ascending manifold of @xmath65 and the descending manifold of @xmath1 maps to a collection of vertical line segments that are not clearly removable . however , it is possible to move such a line segment to the left across @xmath100 , out of the triangle , to lie in the higher - genus side of @xmath100 .",
    "intersections coming from @xmath65 and @xmath100 are ruled out as in the case @xmath99 .    for @xmath102 , without loss of generality",
    "suppose the triangle is on the higher - genus sides of @xmath1 and @xmath100 and the on the lower genus side of @xmath65 .",
    "as in the case @xmath101 , @xmath58 is a finite number of line segments connecting @xmath65 to @xmath1 ( or @xmath65 to @xmath100 ) . since @xmath1 and @xmath100 intersect , their vanishing cycles @xmath103 ( as measured from any reference point @xmath37 in their higher - genus sides ) are isotopic to disjoint circles .",
    "for this reason , for every @xmath37 , every transverse intersection @xmath104 is one of a pair of corners of a lune in @xmath105 , with one side lying in @xmath106 and the other side lying in @xmath107 . by smoothness of the fibration map",
    ", these lunes can be chosen to vary smoothly with @xmath37 .",
    "for all @xmath37 on the higher genus side of both @xmath1 and @xmath100 , simultaneously collapse the lunes by an isotopy sending the @xmath106 side to the @xmath107 side of each . what results in each fiber is a collection of arcs ( perhaps even all of @xmath1 and @xmath100 if they are isotopic ) on which the intersections of the fiber with @xmath1 and @xmath100 coincide .",
    "these arcs vary smoothly with @xmath37 and it is possible to perturb @xmath106 smoothly over all @xmath37 to replace each arc with two parallel arcs , one for @xmath106 and one for @xmath107 . now points in @xmath58 coming from @xmath65 and @xmath1 are necessarily disjoint from @xmath107 for all @xmath37 in the triangle , so they can be pushed out of the triangle across @xmath100 , and those points in @xmath58 coming from @xmath65 and @xmath100 can be pushed out across @xmath1 .    the @xmath108 case , which is not used in this paper because it is strictly genus - decreasing , is included for completeness . here",
    ", @xmath58 is generically a surface in @xmath0 mapping to a codimension 0 subset of @xmath17 , naturally interpreted as a collection of intersection points between vanishing cycles .",
