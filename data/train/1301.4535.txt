    "stereo - images are projected onto the surfaces .",

    "the original cave system had a cubic geometry with a side length of 3 m. a straightforward extension to enlarge the vr space of a cave is to use a rectangular parallelepiped shape .",
    "more sophisticated configurations have been proposed for advanced cave systems , such as starcave  @xcite , but we used the rectangular parallelepiped approach for @xmath0-cave to maximize the vr volume in the space allowed in the irc building .",
    "the side lengths of @xmath0-cave were 3 m @xmath1 3 m @xmath1 7.8 m. as far as we know , this is the largest cave system in japan .",
