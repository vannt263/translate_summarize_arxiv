    "we describe a new quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm to compute the ground - state ( @xmath3k ) properties of systems of interacting fermions . our method",
    ", which is approximate , removes the _ exponential _ scaling of computation time with system size that is characteristic of the infamous fermion `` sign problem''@xcite in qmc simulations @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the general concepts of the algorithm and then describe details for its implementation using the hubbard model as an example .",
    "the test results we present will show that the algorithm makes it possible to compute accurately , in computation times scaling _ algebraically _ with system size , general ground - state properties , such as superconducting pairing correlation functions .",
    "a brief description of the basic cpmc algorithm and some of the results on the hubbard model were published earlier@xcite .",
    "the algorithm , as it will be detailed here , can also be directly applied to study many other lattice models of electron correlations , such as the extended hubbard model , the anderson lattice model , etc . , where computer simulations with existing qmc algorithms are often difficult and sometimes impossible .",
    "application of the method to more general problem classes , such as atoms , molecules , and nuclei , is currently under study .",
    "the new algorithm , called the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) method , has two main ingredients : the _ first _ is casting the projection of the ground state from an arbitrary initial state as importance - sampled branching random walks in a space of slater determinants .",
    "second _ ingredient , used only to deal with the sign problem , is constraining the paths of the random walks so that any slater determinant generated maintains a positive overlap with a known trial wave function @xmath1 .",
    "the first of the two ingredients is an exact procedure .",
    "as we will illustrate , it combines important advantages of two existing methods , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) @xcite and the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) @xcite methods .",
    "for example , our method shares with the latter the ease of computing expectation values of certain correlation functions , which are crucial to probe physical properties but which are often hard to compute accurately by the standard gfmc methods . on the other hand , it shares the gfmc concept of importance sampling with a trial wave function @xmath1 , which greatly improves its efficiency over the afqmc method .",
    "in addition , the realization of the projection by open - ended random walks along the imaginary - time direction , in contrast to the standard afqmc formulation , makes it practical and easy to implement the second ingredient , the constrained path approximation , and hence to eliminate the exponential scaling due to the sign problem .",
    "the constrained path approximation ensures that the monte carlo representation of the projected ground - state has _ no _ asymptotic signal - to - noise ratio decay in imaginary time .",
    "the resulting method is variational , with the computed ground - state energy being an upper bound , and becomes exact if @xmath1 is exact .",
    "the constrained - path approximation builds upon the positive projection technique of fahy and hamann @xcite , but can also be viewed as a generalization of the fixed - node@xcite approximation in the gfmc method . because of the different bases in which the approximations are applied , the effect of the constrained path approximation is expected to be _ different _ from that of the fixed - node approximation .    in section ii , we will summarize the green s function monte carlo and the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo methods for ground - state calculations . here , we will establish the necessary concepts and formalisms from these existing approaches that are integral parts of our new method . in section iii",
    ", we describe the cpmc method in general terms , focusing on the concept of the importance - sampled random walks in slater - determinant space , the nature and consequences of the constrained - path approximation , and the computation of expectation values .",
    "implementations issues are discussed in section iv in the context of the one - band hubbard model . in section",
    "v , we report results for this model that illustrate the accuracy and performance characteristics of the new method .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize and discuss several simple extensions of the cpmc method .",
    "in this section , we summarize the afqmc method and also sketch a particular gfmc method , namely the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method@xcite , that is most analogous to our new method . in discussing the dmc method ,",
    "the approach we use is not standard , but rather it is one designed to provide the necessary groundwork for the description of cpmc .",
    "both the afqmc and the gfmc methods contain elements important to the cpmc method .",
    "for example , the basic techniques of the afqmc method , such as hubbard - stratonovich transformation , imaginary - time propagation of slater determinants , and matrix multiplication stabilization @xcite , are shared by the cpmc method , on the other hand the random walk realization of the propagation@xcite , importance sampling in the random walks by use of a known trial function@xcite , and the fixed - node approximation@xcite are all gfmc concepts of much relevance .",
    "most ground - state quantum monte carlo methods are based on @xmath4 that is , the ground state @xmath5 can be projected from any known trial state @xmath1 that satisfies @xmath6 . in a numerical method ,",
    "the limit can be obtained iteratively by @xmath7 where @xmath8 . with a small @xmath9",
    ", the first - order trotter approximation can be used : @xmath10 typically , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the kinetic and potential energy operators . more generally , they are the one- and two - body interaction operators .      in the afqmc method , the operators and wave function are in a second quantized representation , defined in terms of fermion creation and destruction operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the basis is one of slater determinants : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 are the elements of a matrix @xmath18 of dimension @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the size of the basis and @xmath21 is the number of fermions with spin @xmath22 .",
    "each column of the matrix @xmath18 represents a single - particle orbital that is completely specified by a vector of dimension @xmath20 .",
    "one example of such a slater determinant is the hartree - fock ( hf ) solution @xmath23 , where each @xmath24 is defined by a matrix @xmath25 whose columns are the @xmath21 lowest hf eigenstates .",
    "for any two real non - orthogonal slater determinants , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it can be shown that their overlap integral @xmath28 and single - particle green s function @xmath29_{ij}. \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ]    now we consider the projection ( [ eq : process ] ) in this slater - determinant basis .",
    "the trial wave function @xmath1 can be a linear combination of determinants , but without loss of generality , we assume it is a single determinant .",
    "a key point is that the projection of any slater determinant by any operator of the form @xmath30 simply leads to another slater determinant , i.e. , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 part of ( [ eq : trotter ] ) has the single - particle form of ( [ eq : spo ] ) .",
    "the @xmath35 part , however , represents two - body interactions with @xmath36 . following hubbard ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath12 as a quadratic form : @xmath37 where the parameters @xmath38 and the matrix @xmath39 are defined by the elements @xmath40 and the number of @xmath41 is at most @xmath42 but is often much smaller . with this quadratic form , a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation of the two - body part of ( [ eq : trotter ] ) yields : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an auxiliary - field variable . denoting the collection of such variables by @xmath45 and defining @xmath46 \\prod_\\alpha { \\rm exp}[x_\\alpha \\sqrt{-\\delta\\tau\\lambda_\\alpha }   \\sum c_i^\\dagger r^\\alpha_{ij}c_j]$ ] ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a probability density function and @xmath49 has the desired single - particle form of ( [ eq : spo ] ) .",
    "the essence of the hs transformation is the conversion of an interacting system into many _ non - interacting _ ones living in fluctuating external auxiliary - fields , and the summation over all such auxiliary - field configurations recovers the correct many - body interactions .",
    "we note that different forms of this transformation exist and that they can affect the algorithm performance , possibly to a large degree .",
    "these issues are , however , not of concern here , as we will only be describing the general algorithm .    with ( [ eq : process ] ) and ( [ eq : hs ] ) , the ground - state expectation @xmath50 of some observable @xmath51 can be computed by @xmath52 .",
    "the denominator is @xmath53|\\psi_t\\rangle\\\\     & = & \\int \\bigl[\\prod_l d\\vec x^{(l ) } p(\\vec x^{(l)})\\bigr ]           \\det\\bigl(\\psi_t^{\\rm t } \\prod_l{\\bf b}(\\vec x^{(l)})\\psi_t\\bigr ) \\label{eq : afqmc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the @xmath55 matrix associated with the single - particle operator @xmath49 and equations ( [ eq : ovlp ] ) , ( [ eq : expo ] ) , and ( [ eq : hs ] ) have been applied . in the afqmc method@xcite",
    ", @xmath56 is fixed and the many - dimensional integral in ( [ eq : afqmc ] ) is evaluated by a monte carlo ( mc ) method like the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the mc process samples configurations @xmath57 of the auxiliary - fields distributed according to the absolute value of the integrand .    in the afqmc method ,",
    "the sign problem occurs because in general the determinant in ( [ eq : afqmc ] ) is not always positive .",
    "in fact , its average sign approaches zero exponentially as @xmath56 ( or @xmath20 ) is increased@xcite .",
    "the integral then becomes vanishingly small .",
    "thus an _ exponential _ growth in computation time is required in its evaluation , since the mc samples , drawn from the _ absolute value _ of the integrand , become dominated by noise .",
    "this problem has remained largely uncontrolled , preventing general simulations at low temperatures or large system sizes .",
    "one attempt to control the sign problem was the positive projection approximation proposed by fahy and hamann @xcite .",
    "they used a known wave function @xmath58 and imposed @xmath59 conditions @xmath60 in sampling the auxiliary fields .",
    "the approximation is similar in spirit to that of the fixed - node approximation in the gfmc method .",
    "however , the constraint is _ non - local _ in imaginary time , as any change in @xmath61 affects the constraint conditions at _ all _ times between @xmath62 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus all auxiliary fields had to be updated simultaneously and only paths satisfying all constraint equations were accepted .",
    "the approach is hence computationally very intensive . in our cpmc method",
    ", we adopt the fahy - hamann concept of a constraining state but implement the constraint in the context of a random walk in the space of slater determinants , which makes the procedure practical and straightforward .",
    "the dmc method@xcite executes the iteration in ( [ eq : process ] ) as random walks in configuration space .",
    "when the fixed - point condition is reached , the random walks sample positions in configuration space from a distribution that represents the unknown _ amplitude _ of the ground - state wave function .",
    "we denote the configuration basis by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the electron coordinates in the continuous three - dimensional space . in this basis ,",
    "the potential energy propagator @xmath35 in ( [ eq : trotter ] ) is diagonal , but the kinetic energy propagator @xmath34 , where @xmath65 , is not . in order to write the latter in a more suitable form for a monte carlo treatment ,",
    "we invoke a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation : @xmath66 since @xmath67 displaces @xmath68 in @xmath63 by @xmath69 , the effect of @xmath34 on any @xmath63 can be viewed stochastically as `` diffusing '' it to @xmath70 , where each component @xmath71 of the auxiliary field @xmath45 is drawn from the normal distribution function @xmath72 .    the wave function @xmath73 can be expressed in terms of the amplitudes @xmath74 . in the random walk realization of the iteration , @xmath75",
    "is represented by a finite ensemble of configurations @xmath76 . at each stage",
    ", the monte carlo method provides the stochastic sampling of @xmath77 and consequently the movement @xmath78 for each configuration in the ensemble .",
    "the factor @xmath79 translates into a weight ( branching factor ) for the configuration .",
    "as the iteration approaches the fixed - point condition , the weighted distribution of configurations represents @xmath80 .",
    "the sign problem in the dmc method has a somewhat different character than the sign problem in the afqmc method .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle requires that the fermion wave function @xmath81 change sign if the positions of two electrons with the same spin are interchanged . unlike the afqmc method ,",
    "the dmc method does not impose the anti - symmetric property in the projection process . without additional mechanisms ,",
    "the dmc method naturally produces points distributed according to the lowest eigenstate of the diffusion equation .",
    "this state is symmetric and bosonic - like .",
    "there has only been limited success in attempts to construct exact algorithms that yield asymptotically ( in @xmath56 ) a non - vanishing , anti - symmetric monte carlo signal@xcite .    the fixed - node method @xcite is an approximate scheme to prevent the convergence to the bosonic - like ground state .",
    "antisymmetry in @xmath81 implies that there are equivalent regions in configuration space that are separated by a nodal surface on which @xmath82 .",
    "the exact nodal surface is in general unknown . in the fixed - node approximation ,",
    "a trial nodal surface is assumed , based on a known trial wave function @xmath1 . a solution which is everywhere positive",
    "is then sought in the region @xmath83 by imposing the boundary condition that @xmath75 vanishes at @xmath84 . unless @xmath84 happens to be the correct node , the resulting dmc solution for the ground state is approximate .",
    "the ground - state energy obtained is an upper bound@xcite .",
    "an important feature of the dmc method is importance sampling .",
    "this technique is necessary to reduce the variance of the computed results to acceptable levels . for brevity we will not discuss this technique here",
    "instead , we will postpone such a discussion until it is needed to complete our description of the cpmc algorithm .",
    "we now describe the cpmc algorithm .",
    "it uses the hubbard - stratonovich - based formalism of the afqmc method , but a monte carlo sampling procedure similar to that of the dmc method . the iterative process ( [ eq : process ] ) becomes an open - ended random walk in",
    "_ slater determinant space_. within the framework of this random walk , we introduce importance sampling and the constrained path approximation .",
    "we remark that any antisymmetric wave function can be written as a linear combination of slater determinants , i.e. , @xmath85 where the sum is over each member of the slater determinant basis .",
    "as introduced in section ii , we will always use @xmath86 to denote antisymmetric wave functions and @xmath87 to denote a single slater determinant .",
    "contrary to the configuration space used in the dmc method , the slater - determinant basis space of @xmath87 is _ non - orthogonal _ and _ over - complete_.      using ( [ eq : hs ] ) , we write the iterative equation ( [ eq : process ] ) as @xmath88 in the monte carlo realization of this iteration , we represent the wave function at each stage by a finite ensemble of slater determinants , i.e. , @xmath89 here @xmath90 labels the slater determinants and an overall normalization factor of the wave function has been omitted .",
    "the slater determinants are referred to as _ random walkers _ as they are generated by the random walk . at any stage of the iteration , the sum will be over only part of the basis as the determinants in this sum are statistical samples whose distribution represents the linear coefficient @xmath91 in ( [ eq : grdwf ] ) .",
    "the statistical accuracy of this representation increases algebraically as the number of independent samples is increased . in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : wf ] ) will serve as the definition of the monte carlo representation of a wave function in the cpmc method .",
    "we will start from an initial ensemble where @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "one step of the iteration involves the propagation of each walker according to ( [ eq : cpmc ] ) . since the non - interacting operator @xmath49 operating on any slater determinant leads to another slater determinant , an analytical realization of this propagation for each walker would yield a linear combination of many slater determinants . in our random",
    "walk , this propagation is achieved stochastically by monte carlo ( mc ) sampling of @xmath45 : @xmath93 that is , for each random walker we choose an auxiliary - field configuration @xmath45 from the probability density function @xmath94 and propagate the walker to a new one via @xmath95 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for _ all _ walkers in the population .",
    "these operations accomplish one step of the random walk .",
    "the new population represents @xmath96 in the sense of ( [ eq : wf ] ) .",
    "these steps are iterated indefinitely . after an equilibration phase ,",
    "all walkers thereon are mc samples of the ground - state wave function @xmath5 and ground - state properties can be computed .    in order to improve the efficiency of ( [ eq : cpmc ] ) and make it a practical algorithm , an importance sampling scheme is required . in the procedure just described , no information is contained in the sampling of @xmath45 on the importance of the resulting determinant in representing @xmath5 , yet such information is clearly important .",
    "for example , the ground - state energy is given by @xmath97 .",
    "hence , estimating @xmath98 requires estimating the denominator by @xmath99 , in which @xmath87 denotes random walkers after equilibration .",
    "since these walkers are sampled with no knowledge of @xmath100 , terms in the summation over @xmath101 can have large fluctuations that lead to large statistical errors in the mc estimate of the denominator , thereby in that of @xmath98 .",
    "to introduce importance sampling , we iterate a modified equation with a modified wave function , without changing the underlying eigenvalue problem of ( [ eq : cpmc ] ) .",
    "specifically , for each slater determinant @xmath87 , we define an importance function @xmath102 which estimates its overlap with the ground - state wave function .",
    "we can then rewrite equation ( [ eq : cpmc ] ) as @xmath103 where the modified wave function is @xmath104 and the modified `` probability density function '' is @xmath105 we note that @xmath106 is a function of both the future @xmath107 and the current @xmath108 positions in slater - determinant space .",
    "it is trivially verified that equations ( [ eq : cpmc ] ) and ( [ eq : impcpmc ] ) are identical .",
    "in the random walk , the ensemble of walkers @xmath109 now represents the modified wave function @xmath110 , which is to say that their distribution represents the function @xmath111 . the iterative relation for each walker",
    "is again given by ( [ eq : cpmcsampling ] ) , but with @xmath94 replaced by @xmath112 .",
    "the latter is in general not a normalized probability density function , and we denote the normalization constant for walker @xmath90 by @xmath113 and rewrite ( [ eq : cpmcsampling ] ) as @xmath114 this iteration now forms the basis of the cpmc algorithm .",
    "it is convenient to associate a weight @xmath115 with each walker , which can be initialized to unity .",
    "one step of the random walk is then as follows : for each walker @xmath116 , * ( _ i _ ) * sample a @xmath45 from the probability density function @xmath117 , * ( _ ii _ ) * propagate the walker by @xmath49 to generate a new walker , and * ( _ iii _ ) * compute a weight @xmath118 for the new walker .",
    "steps * ( _ i _ ) * and * ( _ iii _ ) * are sometimes difficult to implement . to ease their implementation",
    ", we apply the hs transformation of ( [ eq : impcpmc ] ) and ( [ eq : impcpmc_p ] ) to _ each _ component of @xmath45 .",
    "this application is simple since both @xmath94 and @xmath49 can be decomposed into a product of independent factors corresponding to individual components @xmath44 .",
    "every step of the random walk then consists of successive sub - steps in which the @xmath44 are sampled one by one , each according to * ( _ i _ ) * thru * ( _ iii_)*. as we discuss in section iv , such a decomposition is adequate to make the hubbard - model application straightforward , since the hs transformation we use allows only two discrete values ( @xmath119 ) for each @xmath44 , and thus the easy tabulation of @xmath120 . for more general cases ,",
    "however , it is often necessary to further approximate @xmath121 .",
    "the following procedure can be adopted : under the assumption of small @xmath122 , the ratio of the overlap integrals is manipulated into the form of an exponential whose exponent is linear in @xmath44 ; @xmath120 is then written as a shifted gaussian times a normalization constant . the basic idea of this procedure is similar to that used in the dmc method .    to better see the effect of importance sampling",
    ", we observe that if @xmath123 , the normalization @xmath124 is a constant .",
    "therefore the weights of walkers remain a constant and the random walk has no fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , we refer again to the estimator for @xmath98 . with importance sampling ,",
    "the denominator becomes the sum of weights @xmath125 , while the numerator is @xmath126 , where again @xmath87 denotes walkers after equilibration .",
    "as @xmath1 approaches @xmath5 , all walkers contribute equally to the estimator and the variance approaches zero .",
    "we emphasize that different choices of importance functions only affect the efficiency of the calculation .      despite the advantages over the standard afqmc method in terms of sampling efficiency , the random walk formulation still suffers from the sign problem . here",
    "we will illustrate the origin of the sign problem in this framework and then introduce the constrained path approximation to eliminate the exponential decay of the average sign .",
    "we will see that while such a fixed - node - like approximation has proved difficult to implement effectively in standard afqmc method @xcite , it is extremely simple to impose under our random walk formulation .    the sign problem occurs because of the fundamental symmetry existing between the fermion ground - state @xmath5 and its negative @xmath127@xcite . for any ensemble of slater determinants @xmath128",
    "which gives a monte carlo representation of the ground - state wave function , this symmetry implies that there exists another ensemble @xmath129 which is also a correct representation . in other words",
    ", the slater determinant space can be divided into two degenerate halves ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) whose bounding surface @xmath132 is defined by @xmath133 and is in general _",
    "unknown_.    in some special cases , such as the particle - hole symmetric , half - filled one - band hubbard model , symmetry prohibits any crossing of @xmath132 in the random walk .",
    "the calculation is then free of the sign problem@xcite . in more general cases , walkers",
    "_ can _ cross @xmath132 in their propagation by @xmath134 .",
    "the sign problem then invariably occurs .",
    "once a random walker reaches @xmath135 , it will make no further contribution to the representation of the ground state : @xmath136 paths that result from such a walker have equal probability of being in either half of the slater determinant space .",
    "computed analytically , they would cancel , but without any knowledge of @xmath132 , they continue to be sampled in the random walk and become monte carlo noise . at sufficiently large @xmath56 ,",
    "the monte carlo representation of the ground - state wave function consists of an _ equal _ mixture of the @xmath130 and @xmath131 ensembles , regardless of where the random walks originated .",
    "the monte carlo signal is therefore lost .",
    "the decay of the signal - to - noise ratio , i.e. the decay of the average sign of @xmath137 , occurs at an exponential rate with imaginary time .    in this regard , the fermion sign problem appears very similar in either the dmc , afqmc , or cpmc algorithms .",
    "the difference between the algorithms is that in the dmc algorithm minus signs appear when particles interchange positions in configuration space while in the cpmc and afqmc algorithms the orbitals must interchange .",
    "the orbitals are an extended quantity and hence , at least for systems near a mean - field solution , the fermion sign problem is reduced .    to eliminate the decay of the signal - to - noise ratio , we impose the constrained - path approximation .",
    "it requires that each random walker at each step have a positive overlap with the trial wave function @xmath1 : @xmath138 this yields an approximate solution to the ground - state wave function , @xmath139 , in which all slater determinants @xmath87 satisfy ( [ eq : constraint ] ) . from ( [ eq : node ] ) , it follows that this approximation becomes _ exact _ for an exact trial wave function @xmath123 .    as a consequence of the constrained - path approximation ,",
    "the ground - state energy @xmath140 , computed by the estimator discussed in section iii a , is an upper bound to the true value @xmath98 . to see this",
    ", we introduce an anti - symmetrization operator @xmath141 in the slater - determinant space that extends any wave function defined in half the space by @xmath142 into the whole space by @xmath143 . since @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is @xmath146 at @xmath132 and @xmath147 elsewhere , we have @xmath148 . both @xmath149 and @xmath150",
    "reside in the same slater - determinant space and both are antisymmetric functions . thus @xmath151 . on the other hand , we recall that @xmath152 and @xmath153 .    to implement the constrained - path approximation in the random walk , we redefine the importance function by ( [ eq : o_t ] ) :",
    "@xmath154 this prevents walkers from crossing the trial nodal surface @xmath132 and entering the `` @xmath131 '' half - space as defined by @xmath1 . in the limit",
    "@xmath155 , ( [ eq : imp_cp ] ) ensures that the walker distribution vanishes smoothly at @xmath132 and the constrained - path approximation is properly imposed . with a finite @xmath122",
    ", however , @xmath106 has a discontinuity at @xmath135 and the distribution does not vanish .",
    "we have found this effect to be very small for reasonably small imaginary - time steps @xmath9 .",
    "nonetheless , we correct for it by modifying @xmath106 near @xmath132 so that it approaches zero smoothly at @xmath132 . as we discuss in section iv ,",
    "the procedure is analogous to the mirror - correction@xcite used in the dmc method .",
    "after the random walk has equilibrated , the distribution of random walkers represents the ground - state wave function @xmath156 under the constrained - path approximation .",
    "various expectation values can then be computed from a population of these walkers and their weights .",
    "for example , the ground - state energy is @xmath157 where terms in the numerator @xmath158 are given by combinations of elements of the green s function as defined in ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "an estimator similar to ( [ eq : mixed ] ) , namely @xmath159 , is easily obtained for any other operator @xmath51 . in the gfmc method , this type of estimator is referred to as the _ mixed _ estimator .",
    "we recall that the true expectation value of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath156 is @xmath160 for the energy , the mixed estimator is equivalent to the true estimator ( [ eq : trueo ] ) , but this is not true for any @xmath51 that does not commute with @xmath161 . in this case",
    ", it is sometimes possible to improve the mixed estimator by the following linear extrapolation@xcite : @xmath162 where the variational estimate @xmath163 .    even a good trial wave function @xmath1 with a good variational energy can sometimes fail to give a reasonable estimate for certain correlation functions .",
    "in such cases , ( [ eq : extrap ] ) will not be effective .",
    "it is then imperative to compute ( [ eq : trueo ] ) .",
    "to do this , we devised a scheme called _ back - propagation _",
    "( bp ) , the essence of which comes from the forward walking ( fw ) technique@xcite in the gfmc method : @xmath164 a subtle distinction , however , exists between back - propagation and forward walking . in back - propagation , @xmath165 is restricted to `` constrained '' paths , i.e. , those paths that do not violate the constraint in the _ original forward direction _ @xmath166 . the standard ground - state dmc method has no sense of `` time , '' because movements in configuration space are exactly reversible . the cpmc method , however , has a time direction : a set of determinants which does not violate the constraint at any time when going from right to left may indeed violate it any even number of times when evaluated from left to right .    because of this sense of direction , expression ( [ eq : bpest ] ) may not yield ( [ eq : trueo ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath167 is itself approximate , this issue is not crucial .",
    "what is crucial is that @xmath168 remains exact for an exact trial wave function . to demonstrate that it does",
    ", we will use perturbation theory and start by considering a hamiltonian @xmath169 where @xmath51 is the operator whose expectation value we seek .",
    "we then apply the cpmc method to the new hamiltonian @xmath170 with a new constraint governed by @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 is orthogonal to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath174 , which is the standard boundary condition of perturbation theory . in the limit of small @xmath175 ,",
    "the constraint becomes identical to that of the original hamiltonian @xmath161 .",
    "to first order in @xmath175 , we thus simply regain the previous expression ( [ eq : bpest ] ) for @xmath168 .",

    "we also ignored back - propagation .",
    "to implement it , an additional procedure is required in each random walk step in the measurement phase . as discussed at the end of section iii c",
    ", this procedure takes _ one _ of the following three possibilities : ( _ i _ ) storing all walkers ( step 6 ) , ( _ ii _ ) storing ancestry links ( step 3 ) and auxiliary fields ( step 3.b.iii ) for each walker , and copying them if necessary ( step 8) , or ( _ iii _ ) back - propagating from @xmath241 , computing @xmath168 , and accumulating results ( step 6 ) .",
    "the length @xmath180 of the back - propagation is pre - set as are the number of iterations in each measurement block , the frequency of measurements , etc .    additionally , we introduced several previously undiscussed steps and procedures .",

    "an inaccurate input of @xmath240 is only a minor concern , since the value of @xmath240 simply changes the total weight systematically by a constant factor .",
    "a statistical estimate of this factor is easily obtained from the random walk by observing the total weights through a number of iterations@xcite . on the average",
    "these totals scale as @xmath244 $ ] and hence provide an estimate of @xmath140 .",
    "this procedure for estimating the ground - state energy is often referred to as the _ growth estimator_.    in the random walk , one walker will eventually dominate all others and the random walk will spend most of its time sampling walkers which contribute little . to avoid such a loss of efficiency , a population control procedure@xcite is needed ( step 8) .",
    "first , a branching ( or birth / death ) scheme is applied , in which walkers with large weights are replicated and ones with small weights are eliminated by some probability . there exist various ways to do this@xcite , with the guideline being that the process should not affect the distribution statistically .",
    "branching allows the total number of walkers to fluctuate and possibly become too large or too small .",
    "thus as a second step , the population size is adjusted , if necessary , by rescaling the weights with an overall factor .",
    "re - adjusting the population size introduces a bias and should only be done infrequently .",
    "if this is not possible due to a poor @xmath1 or poor importance sampling , several calculations must be done with different ( average ) population sizes in order to extrapolate to the infinite population limit .",
    "the overall structure of cpmc resembles a typical gfmc calculation@xcite .",
    "after equilibration , we introduce an intermediate phase in which the growth estimator is computed .",

    "the new value of @xmath240 is then used in the next phase , which is divided into independent blocks .",

    "we have presented a rather detailed discussion of the constrained path monte carlo method to make the cpmc algorithm as transparent as possible . in this section",
    "we present a variety of results from simulations of the hubbard model that are chosen primarily for their importance in illustrating algorithmic issues .",
    "these results are for two - chain and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "first , we give results for the ground - state energy as a function of system size @xmath20 , filling fraction @xmath254 , and trial wave function .",
    "later , we examine results for other physical quantities such as pairing correlation functions .      in figure 1",
    "we demonstrate the convergence and stability of the cpmc method .",
    "the energy ( top ) and overlap integral ( bottom ) are plotted as a function of imaginary time @xmath255 . on the left , we demonstrate the initial convergence from the trial wave function to the ground state , and on the right , the asymptotic stability of the algorithm .",
    "this figure is constructed for an @xmath256 lattice with @xmath257 , and @xmath258 .",
    "this parameterization generates a fairly difficult system for the afqmc method because of the sign problem .",
    "@xmath259 was an unrestricted hartree - fock wave function obtained with @xmath260 ( _ not _",
    "@xmath261 ) and yielded a variational energy of @xmath262 .",
    "the average number of walkers was @xmath263 .",
    "the behavior shown is quite typical of cpmc calculations .    in the relaxation phase ( @xmath264 ) , a trial energy of @xmath265 was used .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the true ground - state energy , so the overlap integral @xmath266 , and consequently the population size , grows quite rapidly . during this phase",
    ", population control is applied frequently ( every @xmath267 steps ) .",
    "the rapid fluctuations in value of the overlap integral shown in the bottom left are due to re - adjustments of the total population size in each of these applications . for @xmath268 (",
    "not shown ) , we used the same @xmath240 and applied population control with the same frequency , but computed the ground - state energy with the growth estimator .",
    "this value was then used for the trial energy @xmath240 during the measurement phase ( @xmath269 ) . in this phase , even though population control was applied every @xmath270 steps and branching occurs , the total population size remained within the pre - set lower and upper bounds of @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "indeed , all vertical displacements in the overlap integral in the lower right of the figure correspond to the beginning of a block where we reset the population size to within @xmath273 of the expected average of 600 .",
    "clearly , the values of both the overlap integral and the energy are completely stable as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , the standard afqmc method has a bad sign problem .",
    "indeed , for a @xmath274 lattice at the same filling fraction and the same @xmath275 , the average sign decays exponentially by roughly @xmath267 _ orders of magnitude _ as the imaginary time increases from @xmath147 to @xmath276 @xcite .",
    "the ground - state energy @xmath277 .",
    "( extrapolation to @xmath278 will slightly reduce the average value . )",
    "the best afqmc result available for this system is @xmath279@xcite , which is slightly higher than our upper bound .",
    "the @xmath280-dependence of the energy after convergence is shown in the upper right of the figure .",
    "the inset demonstrates the short - term fluctuations in the mixed estimate of the energy ; these fluctuations are also shown as the solid line in the main figure .",
    "constructing local `` binned '' averages of the energy from blocks of length @xmath281 yields the energy estimates shown as dotted lines in the inset .",
    "these binned averages are nearly statistically independent , and their root mean squared deviations divided by the square - root of the number of bins yielded the quoted statistical error .    the computational requirements of the cpmc method are fairly modest when compared , for example , with the afqmc method .",
    "efficiency , however , can be dramatically affected by implementation issues .",
    "two important issues are the accuracy of the trial wave function and of the imaginary - time propagator . to obtain the maximum efficiency , it is essential to use a propagator accurate to second order in the break - up between kinetic and potential terms .",
    "for example , figure 2 shows the energies obtained for first - order and second - order trotter approximations for the propagators for a @xmath274 lattice with @xmath282 spins and @xmath283 .",
    "the first - order propagator introduces significant systematic effects even for quite small time steps , however , the second order propagator permits significantly larger values of @xmath284 to be used .",
    "we note that we also included a mirror correction to the propagation to make certain that there are no corrections of order less than @xmath285 . in this case , however , the differences between using second - order propagators with and without this correction are comparable to the error bars in the figure .    of course , while stability and efficiency are necessary for a useful simulation , accuracy is the principal concern . in tables",
    "i and ii , we compare our results for the hubbard model to exact results for small systems and to other methods for large systems . since the cpmc method depends upon approximate knowledge of the ground state of the system , we also included results for different trial wave functions . to date , we have used only free - electron and unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) trial wave functions .    in table",
    "i , we see that the accuracy of the cpmc ground - state energy is always better than 5% , often much better , even when the trial wave function is very poor .",
    "the worst case is @xmath286 with @xmath261 @xmath202 and @xmath261 @xmath203 spins , which is an open - shell case that corresponds to a very difficult filling fraction for the afqmc method , and has a large @xmath275 of @xmath287 , which makes single - determinant trial wave functions rather poor approximations .",
    "the hartree - fock wave function used as @xmath1 had a very poor energy , @xmath288 , compared to the exact energy of @xmath289 .",
    "the cpmc method however was still able to obtain an energy of @xmath290 .",
    "clearly a more accurate approximation to the ground state wave function would yield an even better result .    in table",
    "ii we compare our results with available data from other numerical approaches , including stochastic diagonalization ( sd ) @xcite , afqmc , and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite methods .",
    "the sd method uses monte carlo methods to attempt the construction of an efficient basis for approximating the ground state wave function of the system .",
    "since an explicit basis is used , no sign problem occurs ; however , an exponential growth in computing time occurs reflecting the increased effort in selecting members of the basis as system size increases .",
    "in contrast , the afqmc method is in principle exact , but suffers from exponential growth in computing time as system size increases because of the sign problem . finally , the dmrg method is a variational method that is very effective for one - dimensional and quasi - one - dimensional models .    in table ii we focus filling fractions @xmath291 around or greater than @xmath292 as they are more interesting and also more difficult for qmc calculations . for the closed - shell @xmath274 system ,",
    "the results from the cpmc , sd , and afqmc methods agree well .",
    "as we increase the lattice size , the sd results are comparatively poorer , presumably because of an insufficient number of states . the results from the afqmc and cpmc methods continue to agree well up to fairly large lattice sizes .",
    "the worst case is an @xmath293 lattice with @xmath294 @xmath202 and @xmath294 @xmath203 spins , where the cpmc result lies approximately 0.4% @xmath295 0.2% above the afqmc result . for still larger lattice sizes ,",
    "the sign problem limits the use of the afqmc method to only closed - shell systems , for which the sign problem is much reduced . even in these cases , we see that the error estimates in afqmc are much larger than the corresponding statistical errors from the cpmc method . in the @xmath296 case ,",
    "the difference is roughly a factor of @xmath297 , i.e. , about a factor of @xmath298 more in cpu time .",
    "( our calculations typically took tens of hours on an ibm rs6000 590 . ) furthermore , the cpmc result is actually lower in energy in this case than the afqmc results , but size of the error bars in afqmc are similar to the difference between the two results .",
    "the cpmc result on a @xmath2 lattice , a size far beyond the reach of the afqmc method due to the sign problem , was obtained from a simulation comparable to that for the @xmath296 system in terms of the numbers of iterations and walkers .",
    "for the two - chain system , we obtained excellent agreement with the dmrg results of noack _",
    "et al_. here the energy agreed to within less than 0.1% .      to effectively study ground - state properties , we need to accurately calculate pairing correlation functions , momentum distributions , and other ground - state expectation values . in previous sections , we discussed various ways of estimating a ground - state expectation value , in particular the back - propagation scheme .",
    "here we will mostly benchmark results and further discuss related algorithmic behavior .",
    "we remark that for any simulation method correlation functions are in general much more difficult to compute than the energy .",
    "thus there is limited data available from other methods with which we can benchmark our correlation functions .",

    "we see that the two trial wave functions yield very different variational estimates , but their cpmc results are consistent and in reasonable agreement with exact results .",
    "for example , in the free - electron - like @xmath323 , the momentum distribution is a step function , and the @xmath326 state is completely occupied ( @xmath327 ) , but with this trial wave function the cpmc method still gives the correct occupation of @xmath328 .    in figure 3",

    "the expectation values obtained directly from these two different trial wave functions are shown in thick lines , and the corresponding back - propagation estimates @xmath184 are shown with thin lines . while the two cpmc estimates do not agree exactly , they do demonstrate a much closer correspondence with each other than those obtained with the original wave functions .",
    "the case shown is comparatively easy because of the small size of the lattice and the relatively low value of electron filling .",
    "however , the overall trend is rather general .",
    "we described in detail the background , formalism , and implementation of the new constrained path monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the cpmc method is a general quantum monte carlo algorithm for computing fermion ground - state properties .",
    "it introduces several new concepts , including importance - sampled random walks in a slater - determinant space and the constrained path approximation within this framework .",
    "the algorithm combines advantages of the existing green s function monte carlo and auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo methods , is free of any signal - to - noise ratio decay , and scales algebraically with system size . together with data in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that the method produces very accurate results for the hubbard model , even with very simple choices of the trial wave function @xmath1 .",
    "compared to the gfmc method , the current algorithm allows the random walk to take place in a basis other than that of configurations or occupation numbers . in this sense , the cpmc algorithm is a generalization of the gfmc algorithm .",
    "the cpmc method expresses the ground - state wave function ( stochastically ) in the form of ( [ eq : wf ] ) , rather than @xmath332 as in the gfmc method .",
    "this is advantageous as it makes feasible the use of various techniques developed for one - electron calculations for atoms and solids .",
    "in addition , it makes our back - propagation scheme efficient and effective .",
    "thus expectation values can be computed via ( [ eq : g ] ) , while in the gfmc method the analogous forward walking technique has often been difficult and computations of some correlation functions have almost been impossible .",

    "the systematic error in the cpmc method arises because the solution it yields , in the form of ( [ eq : grdwf ] ) , has the artificial constraint @xmath336 .    in the cpmc method",
    ", each slater determinant @xmath87 analytically defines a continuous function @xmath335 in contrast to walkers in the gfmc method which are delta - functions .",
    "it is thus easier to impose symmetries .",
    "one example is the trivial case of a non - interacting system : the cpmc method naturally yields the correct result , while standard gfmc still requires knowledge of the node .",
    "another is the one - band hubbard model at half - filling , where the cpmc method retains the exact nature of the afqmc method , while the gfmc method retains the sign problem@xcite .",
    "recently , ten haaf and van leeuwen@xcite presented data on the hubbard model from standard gfmc simulations with the fixed - node approximation , which they and collaborators had earlier generalized@xcite to treat lattice fermion systems . for the @xmath274 system in table",
    "ii ( @xmath299 @xmath283 ) , the cpmc result for the energy per site is @xmath337 ( exact value @xcite : @xmath338 ) . with an _ identical _ trial wave function ,",
    "the fixed - node calculations of ten haaf and van leeuwen yielded @xmath339 . incorporating a gutzwiller factor only slightly improved their fn result to @xmath340 .",
    "unfortunately , the rest of their results are all fn energies computed for half - filled systems , for which the cpmc energies would be _ exact_. further comparisons away from half - filling would allow a more systematic understanding of the relative strengths of the cpmc method .",
    "it is worth noting that the cpmc algorithm provides a stochastic method closely linked with more traditional quantum chemistry approaches such the configuration interaction ( ci ) method .",
    "similar to the ci method , the cpmc method produces a collection of determinants whose sum represents the ground - state wave function .",
    "the determinants , however , do not have to be orthogonal to each other .",
    "furthermore , they are generated efficiently and _ systematically _ by a monte carlo process that is _ guided _ by importance sampling .",
    "the drawback of the cpmc method is of course its variational nature due to the cp approximation .",
    "we are currently investigating several schemes for further improving the algorithm .",
    "these include a method analogous to released - node technique @xcite in the gfmc method . for the energy",
    ", this seems straightforward . for other expectation values , it involves evaluating @xmath341 defined as : @xmath342 \\exp [ -\\tau_1 h ] | { \\cal o}| \\exp [ -\\tau_1 h ] | \\psi_0 \\rangle.\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath161 is the original hamiltonian without the constraint , and @xmath343 indicates the hamiltonian in the presence of the constraint .",
    "hence , for a period of twice @xmath344 , we evolve the system without constraint and for another @xmath345 we include the constraint . in the limit of zero @xmath344",
    "we obtain the approximation used to date , while finite @xmath344 improves the estimate , i.e. , makes it exact , at the cost of increasing statistical error .",
    "the bookkeeping in such a calculation could be arranged to calculate directly the difference between the current @xmath346 and the transient estimation , and hence to provide a stringent test on the accuracy of a given calculation .",
    "other possibilities for improving estimates of expectation values include optimization techniques for improving the trial wave function .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the algorithm as described can be used with a multi - determinant @xmath1 , with the computational cost increasing only linearly with the number of determinants .",
    "thus it is desirable to have good trial wave functions in the form of linear combinations of slater determinants .",
    "in addition , wave functions in this form that can be tuned systematically to yield different properties would be highly useful , since self - consistency checks with the cpmc method can then be carried out simply by changing parameters in @xmath1 . yet",
    "other algorithmic topics include the development of interacting - walker @xcite and mirror potential @xcite analogs .",

    "we will use the phrase `` green s function monte carlo '' in a very general sense to indicate methods that project the ground state from a trial initial state by an importance - sampled random walk , where wave functions are expressed in a configuration basis and represented by a monte carlo sample .",
    "the difference in the methods will be attributed to differences in the choice of the projection operator .",
    "we will use the phrase `` auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo '' to refer to the class of fermion methods briefly summarized in section ii a. we note that the adoption of this name is relatively recent , even though the methods have been used for a number of years , often with the generic name quantum monte carlo , both at finite- and zero - temperatures . here",
    "we use afqmc in order to distinguish from other qmc methods .                      if @xmath1 is a linear combination of slater determinants , we can initialize walkers by sampling the individual slater determinants according to their overlap with @xmath1 .",
    "ones with negative overlaps are either avoided or manipulated so that the form used in the initial population gives a positive overlap .",
    "one can attempt to improve the calculation of @xmath347 by creating a better importance sampling for the left - hand random walk that both imposes the constraint with @xmath348 and attempts to incorporate the necessary correlations between the left - hand random walker and its matching right - hand walker .",
    "for example , we can take an importance function @xmath349 , where @xmath41 is a parameter and @xmath350 is the walker with which @xmath351 will be matched in the regular population representing the right - hand wave function .",
    "while this offers a significant improvement over the naive calculation of @xmath352 , we found it still prone to significant fluctuations .",
    "we are investigating other schemes to provide more accurate calculations of the direct expectation value .",
    "care must be taken in constructing the importance function in the half - filled case . the definition in ( [ eq : o_t ] )",
