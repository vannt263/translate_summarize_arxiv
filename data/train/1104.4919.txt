    "block copolymers have been recently the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies , as such systems are highly involved in industrial applications  @xcite .",
    "block copolymer melts is the most studied system with this respect  @xcite .",
    "we also note here that various copolymer systems have been studied in many other occasions concerning different geometries , i.e. , in a selective nanoslit  @xcite , on nanopatterned surfaces  @xcite , in nanopores  @xcite , in the case of nanoparticle aggregation  @xcite , etc .",
    "lots of theoretical , experimental , and simulation studies are dealing with these systems .",
    "in particular , theory predicts that melts of block copolymer chains for the most symmetrical case ( equal block length and composition ) form lamellar structure , given that the scaling parameter that controls the phase behaviour ( @xmath6 ) is high enough to lead to phase separation between the a and b blocks  @xcite .",
    "simulations have confirmed that this parameter controls the phase behaviour of such systems  @xcite .",
    "it has also been discussed that the geometry of the microphase separated regions is controlled by the number of blocks @xmath1 , as well as other parameters , i.e. , relative size and arrangement of blocks  @xcite .",
    "then , theoretical studies were extended covering the case of melts of multiblock copolymer chains ( two types of monomers are composing each chain composed of more than two blocks ) .",
    "it was shown that this case has similar behaviour to a melt of diblock copolymer chains  @xcite .",
    "that is , a lamellar structure for the most symmetric case .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of infinitely dilute solutions , it is sufficient to study isolated multiblock copolymer chains , where interactions ( which can be of short range ) only within the chain and the effect of the solvent are relevant  @xcite .",
    "the phase behaviour of such systems has been studied by means of computer simulations for chain lengths and temperature ranges accessible to simulations  @xcite .",
    "also , the dynamic properties of such macromolecules have been the subject of recent simulation studies  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such systems are also closely related to various toy models ( i.e. , the hp model  @xcite ) , which try to mimic the behaviour of various biomacromolecules , which are formed by periodically repeated structural units ( `` monomers '' ) along their chain , in order to understand complicated biological processes , i.e. , protein folding  @xcite , helical structures  @xcite etc .    under theta conditions ( @xmath7 ) or temperatures close to the @xmath7 temperature",
    ", it is expected that a single linear symmetric multiblock copolymer chain would form a coil structure , where blocks of different type ( a , b ) hardly come across  @xcite .",
    "in fact , an expansion in the chain dimensions of the chain is taking place due to the repulsive interactions between neighboring blocks a and b along the chain . also , the spherical symmetry of the macromolecule should give its place to an ellipsoidal overall formation  @xcite .",
    "the chain flexibility could also be restricted as a result of the neighboring unfavorable interactions of different monomer types along the chain .",
    "however , the most interesting behaviour is observed under poor solvent conditions . in this case , chain collapses adopting a globular overall formation and different aspects of phase behaviour have been discussed depending on the block length @xmath0 , the number of blocks @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath2 , which can be used to tune the quality of the solvent  @xcite .",
    "it has been discussed that three different regimes can be unambiguously distinguished ; a regime where only two domains of monomers of different type are formed . in this case",
    "all blocks of a monomers form a single cluster , while all the blocks of b - type monomers belong to another cluster without occurrence of any variation in the number of clusters .",
    "this means that the clusters are always separated by an a - b interface and never one cluster of a or b monomers splits in two distinct clusters .",
    "another scenario suggests that full phase separation , as defined above , takes place with a certain probability , which can be very high or very small according to the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , while the third scenario corresponds to the case that full phase separation as discussed above ( formation of only two clusters with different type of monomers ) can not take place and a symmetric variation in the number of clusters @xmath8 around an average value @xmath9 is observed  @xcite .",
    "guided by theory  @xcite , one would rather expect in the long chain limit that a ground - state type structure would be a single lamellar domain , where an interface between all a- and b - type blocks is formed , similarly to what is known for multiblock copolymer melts .",
    "such a structure would have much less ( unfavorable ) a - b contacts compared to a multidomain structure of a and b clusters , which is kinetically favored in simulations .",
    "the phase behaviour of multiblock copolymer chains has been already rather extensively discussed  @xcite .",
    "the overall properties of single multiblock copolymer chains have also been the subject of various studies  @xcite . in the following we focus our discussion on the static properties of the formed clusters of a single multiblock copolymer chain for a variety of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 accessible to our simulations . in this way",
    ", we provide a complete picture of the cluster formations in a single multiblock copolymer chain under poor solvent conditions .",
    "our results are discussed within the framework of recent results on the phase behaviour of such macromolecules  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe our simulation model and methods to analyze our results . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present our results on the analysis of the size of the formed clusters , and in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we have considered symmetric linear multiblock copolymers , i.e. , the length of all blocks , irrespective of their type , is @xmath0 , the number of a - type blocks is equal to the number of b - type blocks with @xmath1 being an even number denoting the total number of blocks . in our model the blocks of type a and b alternate along the chain .",
    "the above parameters are presented schematically in figure  [ fig1 ] , where the different colours correspond to the different types of blocks .",
    "a single multiblock chain of four blocks is shown ; two blocks of a - type monomers and two blocks of b - type monomers compose the multiblock chain in this figure .",
    "our chains are modelled by the standard bead - spring model  @xcite , where the beads interact via a cut and shifted lennard - jones ( lj ) potential given by the following formula @xmath10 + c , \\quad r \\leq r_c \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote the different type of monomers , and the constant @xmath13 is defined such that the potential is continuous at the cut - off ( @xmath14 ) . for simplicity , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , but @xmath17 , in order to create an unmixing tendency between monomers a and b belonging to different blocks as done in previous studies , and as is used for a standard system ( lj fluid )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 was kept the same throughout our simulations and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) was varied by tuning the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the connectivity along the chain is maintained by the `` finitely extensible non - linear elastic '' ( fene ) potential @xmath21 , \\quad 0 < r \\leq r_0.\\ ] ] @xmath22 , and the standard choices @xmath23 and @xmath24 were used .    for this model",
    "we know rather roughly the @xmath7 temperature  @xcite , namely @xmath25 .",
    "we also know that for the lj fluid , which is a standard system , phase separation occurs at a temperature close to @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , the phase separation is favored by the increasing degree of polymerization , and we expect to be able to observe phase separation at temperatures down to @xmath27 , making also use of our previous experience with this model  @xcite . indeed , phase separation is encountered for the systems under consideration ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . for many of the studied cases phase separation is already observed at temperatures close to @xmath28 , which is the temperature that the system enters to the regime where the chains collapse , i.e. , effects due to solvent are progressively becoming important .",
    "it is also clear that the use of symmetric structural and potential parameters facilitates our study .",
    "moreover comparison with theoretical arguments could rather be more relevant .",
    "we use standard molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations where the temperature is controlled by a langevin thermostat , as is done in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "thus , the equation of motion @xmath29 is numerically integrated using the gromacs package . in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , @xmath30 denotes time , @xmath31 is the total potential the @xmath32th bead experiences , @xmath33 is the mass which is taken as unity , @xmath34 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath35 the random force . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related by the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath36 as in previous work  @xcite , the friction coefficient was chosen as @xmath37 . for the integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) the leap - frog algorithm  @xcite is used with a time step of @xmath38 , where the natural time unit is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "we simulated our systems at a temperature close to the @xmath7 temperature ( @xmath40 ) with an integration time step @xmath41 .",
    "for longer chains , we used higher temperatures for long equilibration runs , which were typically @xmath42 .",
    "after equilibration , we collected a number of independent samples ( typically @xmath43 ) , which we used as initial configurations for slow cooling runs .",
    "we remind the reader , that in our simulations , the effect of the solvent is taken into account only implicitly , i.e. , the solvent quality is tuned by variation of the temperature as is common practice . for our slow cooling runs ,",
    "the temperature was lowered from a high temperature ( @xmath44 ) to a lower one ( @xmath27 ) in temperature steps @xmath45 , for running the system at each temperature for a time range of @xmath46 md steps . for temperatures below @xmath47 the intrinsic relaxation time of the chains",
    "starts to exceed the simulation time .",
    "therefore , taking this big number of statistically independent `` cooling histories '' is indispensable , in order to obtain meaningful statistical results .",
    "we also point out that , the temperature @xmath27 is low enough in order to access the most interesting regime where the chains collapse to form cluster formations . of course , simulating lower temperatures could be also interesting in order to try to compare our results with relevant theoretical arguments given our rather short chain lengths , but then it would be impossible to simulate such a system with our method .",
    "we also note , that the size @xmath48 of the simulation box was chosen such that the multiblock copolymer chain never interacts with its periodic images .",
    "for instance , for a chain of total length @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for smaller or longer chains we used correspondingly smaller or bigger simulation boxes satisfying always the above criterion for the size @xmath48 of the simulation box .",
    "further details on the simulated model have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    at temperatures close to @xmath7 ,",
    "coil structures are formed and it seems visually ( figure  [ fig2](a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) ) that small differences exist for multiblock chains of different structural parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 , as for example in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "of course , even at this high temperature differences in the overall formation of the coil structure occur , but , here , we mainly focus on the static properties of the clusters .",
    "the most interesting effect would be that the overall formation of the chains deviates from a spherical shape . at such temperatures , blocks of the same type of beads",
    "can only form occasionally clusters due to the highly present thermal fluctuations . at temperatures below",
    "@xmath51 the chains collapse and blocks of the same type of monomers form clusters with other monomers belonging to different blocks , due to the unfavorable interactions between a and b beads .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows also this case of phase separation , where in case ( b ) all blocks of the same type are not able to join together to a single cluster . in this case",
    ", we have a symmetric variation in the number of clusters , as it has been discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "then in case ( d ) , the formation of two only clusters of dissimilar blocks is taking place with a certain probability , which might be high or small according to the choice of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in case",
    "( f ) the blocks of different type are always phase separated and they form two different clusters , with an a - b interface formed between clusters . here , the thermal fluctuations can not overcome the incompatibility between dissimilar beads , and the clusters are always phase separated .",
    "one would need to identify the beads belonging to each cluster in order to describe the overall size of these cluster formations .",
    "we used the stillinger criterion and the standard choice @xmath52  @xcite , as is done in previous work  @xcite .",
    "we also used smaller values of @xmath53 and similar results were obtained , while higher @xmath53 values are hardly significant , due to the rapid fall - off of the lj potential .",
    "properties , @xmath54 , depending on the fluctuating number of clusters , should be averaged with the probability @xmath55 that a number of clusters per block occurs ( @xmath56 ) , i.e. , @xmath57 due to the symmetry of our model , the statistical analysis for a and b clusters should end up in the same results .",
    "this is confirmed in our analysis , validating also our simulation protocol .",
    "therefore , results on the clusters properties will refer either to clusters with monomers of type a or clusters of monomers b only , and nowhere clusters of a and b monomers in a single cluster are considered , although this is possible given our criterion @xmath58 due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "in figure  [ fig3 ] we present results for the density profiles of multiblock chains with the same total length @xmath49 , but different combination of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , mathematically expressed by the following formula @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the dirac delta function , @xmath61 the position of the center of mass of the whole chain and @xmath62 the positions of all monomers irrespective of their type ( a or b ) .",
    "the angle brackets denote an average over all configurations as usual . at low temperatures ( e.g. , in figure  [ fig3](a ) @xmath63 )",
    "the differences are more pronounced than they appear at higher temperatures , i.e. , @xmath44 ( figure  [ fig3](b ) ) . however , the differences between a homopolymer chain of the same length ( @xmath64 ) and multiblock chains ( @xmath49 ) at both temperatures are rather high even at temperatures close to @xmath7 showing that the case of multiblock copolymers strongly deviates from the case of a homopolymer chain .",
    "multiblock copolymer chains are rather overally swollen in the radial directions due to the unfavorable interactions between neighboring a and b blocks at `` high '' temperature and all different blocks at lower temperatures . at @xmath63 and for small @xmath1 ( or equivalently high @xmath0 ,",
    "since @xmath65 is fixed in this case ) the multiblock copolymers have pronounced differences in their densities close to the center of the macromolecule .",
    "this region of @xmath1 @xmath66 for this total chain length corresponds to the case ( f ) of figure  [ fig2 ] , where full phase separation of the blocks of different type has taken place .",
    "even though the chains exhibit the same phase behaviour , rather pronounced differences are observed in density profiles , showing that the interface between a and b monomers is not the same in all cases .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , one would expect that the contacts between a and b monomers at the interface should also increase in the collapse state ( @xmath27 ) , and the cross - section should rather change from a double - cylinder - like to a dumbbell - like shape  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is relevant that we count the contacts between a and b beads , which is expressed by the following formula  @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the absolute value of the distance between two sites of monomers @xmath69 in the multiblock copolymer chain , and @xmath70 the corresponding radial distribution function .",
    ".  [ eq92 ] means that a pair of monomers @xmath71 is defined to have a pairwise contact if their distance is less than @xmath58 .",
    "similar quantities have been also used to characterize the incompatibility between linear and star chains in polymer melts and blends  @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen from figure  [ fig4 ] , the number of contacts a - b averaged over all conformations increases as the number of blocks @xmath1 increases . also , we could see from figure  [ fig4](b ) that the average number of blocks has a linear dependence on the number of blocks @xmath1 , although we have always the formation of only two phase separated clusters , and the number of contacts per monomer remains less than @xmath72 .",
    "one would expect that @xmath73 could be an indication for full phase separation .",
    "lower values of unfavorable contacts is an indication for the occurrence of only two phase separated clusters of a and b blocks ( full phase separation ) , present at this low temperature . for high values of @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig3](a ) ) there are rather small differences in the density profiles . in this regime",
    "a variation in the number of clusters has been observed . at @xmath44",
    "( figure  [ fig3](b ) ) the differences , which were present for small @xmath1 at low temperatures , have almost disappeared . already at @xmath28",
    "the behaviour shown in figure  [ fig3](b ) preempts that of figure  [ fig3](a ) , and is an indication that the chain leaves the collapsed state .",
    "for @xmath74 differences should also result from the deviation of the overall formation from a completely spherically formation .",
    "we postpone such detailed discussion on these phenomena to a later communication .",
    "+    we turn now to the properties characterizing the size of the clusters . assuming that there should not be any preferential orientation , it is natural to characterize the size of our clusters by calculating the gyration radii of the formed clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows results for @xmath75 and the temperature dependence of their size . for these results",
    "the total length of the multiblock copolymer chains is @xmath49 .",
    "at first , we can clearly see ( figure  [ fig5](a ) ) the effect of the temperature on the homopolymer chain .",
    "a major change in the slope of the cluster size with the temperature occurs at temperatures close to @xmath28 and it is completed at temperatures close to @xmath76 . a smooth crossover from coil - like structures to collapsed - chain structures takes place for this range of temperatures .",
    "this crossover becomes smoother in the multiblock copolymer cases .",
    "also , it seems to be slightly shifted to lower temperatures , i.e. , close to @xmath77 . for the multiblock copolymer chains",
    ", we can distinguish two different behaviours . for small @xmath1",
    "( these cases correspond to phase behaviour like the one shown in figure  [ fig2](f ) ) , the size of the clusters shows a monotonic behaviour with the temperature variation , i.e. , the size of the cluster increases monotonically with the increase of the temperature .",
    "as @xmath1 increases the variation with the temperature is smaller .",
    "of course at high temperatures , where rather individual blocks compose each cluster , the size of these clusters has a straightforward dependence on the size of the individual blocks .",
    "moreover , the length is rather high ( @xmath1 low , since @xmath78 in this case ) and the probability of two clusters to join is `` high '' , due to the high length of the blocks and the high flexibility of the chain , which has a lower number of unfavorable a - b contacts .",
    "then , we can distinguish a second behaviour , where the size of the clusters at higher temperatures are smaller than the clusters at low temperatures . in this case and at temperatures close to @xmath7 , the clusters ,",
    "which are composed of rather individual blocks , have smaller dimensions compared to their size at low temperatures , where blocks join together leading to the formation of clusters of monomers of the same type .",
    "overall , as the number of blocks @xmath1 increases , the behaviour of multiblock copolymers deviates further from the homopolymer case .",
    "moreover , the decrease of the block length @xmath0 results in clusters of smaller dimensions in all cases and at all temperatures . only at low temperatures and in the regime where full phase separation occurs ( small values of @xmath1 , in the range of @xmath0 and @xmath2 presented here ) we can see that the clusters have the same size .",
    "this is the case that the multiblock copolymer chain has only two clusters with monomers of different type , but each cluster contains the same number of monomers a or b for different @xmath1 .",
    "this is the proof that the interface between a and b clusters is mainly held responsible for the differences arising in the density profiles for small @xmath1 at low temperatures .",
    "it is natural that the size of the single cluster of the homopolymer case should be the highest at `` high '' temperatures ( the block is the longest , @xmath64 in this case ) .",
    "however , plotting our data in a different way figure  [ fig5](b ) , we can see that the dimensions of the clusters are on average ( normalized by @xmath0 ) higher as the dimension of the individual blocks at higher temperatures .",
    "in such a plot one could still distinguish between the different regimes discussed above .    in figure  [ fig6 ] we present results for the dependence of the average size of the cluster formations on the number of blocks @xmath79 of a - type monomers",
    "of course , as it has been already discussed the results are the same for b - type monomers due to the symmetry of our model . therefore ,",
    "keeping constant the block length @xmath0 , we altered the number of blocks @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig6](a ) presents such results at @xmath27 . when @xmath0 is small ( e.g. , @xmath80 ) , a rather small variation with the number @xmath79 of a or b blocks is seen .",
    "as the block length increases the slope of the curves also increases , showing that the variation with the number of blocks @xmath1 is high .",
    "it should be conceivable that also for high @xmath0 ( @xmath81 ) a plateau - like regime could be reached as in the case of @xmath80 , such that the system departs from the full phase separation regime . yet",
    ", we are not able to access this regime with our simulations . by increasing the temperature , for instance @xmath47 ( not shown here )",
    ", the cases of small @xmath0 do not show any dependence with the variation of the number of blocks , whereas for high @xmath0 the linear dependence regime becomes smaller .",
    "we know that phase separation is favored from higher block lengths .",
    "therefore , blocks of small @xmath0 start to behave independently ( leave a cluster ) already at a lower temperature . at temperatures close to the @xmath7 temperature ( above @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath82 , figure  [ fig6](b ) ) cluster formations containing two or more blocks of the same type of monomers are hardly formed .",
    "therefore , one should hardly observe any dependence on the number of blocks @xmath1 and the size of the clusters should rather reflect the size of individual blocks however , we remind the reader that , even at these high temperatures , blocks with monomers of the same type do occasionally form clusters , and therefore the size of these clusters should not be considered absolutely as the size of the individual blocks",
    ".    it would be desirable to plot our results in such a way that the regime of rather individual clusters could be distinguished from the regime of collapsed chain .",
    "such plots are shown in figure  [ fig7 ] . at low temperatures ( i.e. , @xmath27 , figure  [ fig7](a ) ) and for block lengths @xmath0 below @xmath83 ( for these systems a variation in the number of clusters is observed and occasionally two only separated clusters of different monomers are observed  @xcite ) the curves do not show any systematic behaviour .",
    "it is only for higher block length @xmath0 , where the block length high enough to lead to phase separation between different blocks , that we can clearly see the different behaviour .",
    "a `` plateau regime '' is accessed faster for higher @xmath0 . as the temperature increases ( above @xmath51 )",
    ", we reach a temperature where the curves collapse onto a single curve for the different block lengths @xmath0 showing the same behaviour with the number of a or b blocks @xmath79 .",
    "our claim for a universal temperature boundary around @xmath28 ( figure  [ fig7](b ) ) seems to be correct .",
    "the effect of the solvent quality is proven to play an important role below this temperature , for all the multiblock chains .",
    "further increase of the temperature increases the overall size of the chains .",
    "thus , at @xmath44 ( not shown here ) the curves are still on top of each other as in figure  [ fig7](b ) , but only a small change in the slope of the curves with the number of blocks @xmath79 can be observed .",
    "this shows that the increase of the temperature has the effect of weakening further the dependence on the number of blocks @xmath1 . also ,",
    "increase of the temperature shifts the curvatures slightly to higher values of @xmath84 , as it is expected .",
    "we can present correspondingly the dependence of the cluster sizes on the block length for different multiblock copolymer chains composed of different number of blocks ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "such plots are presented in figure  [ fig8 ] for two different temperatures , i.e. , a low temperature where the chain is fully collapsed , and a temperature close to the @xmath7 temperature .",
    "we have seen that full phase separation between blocks can not take place when the block length is lower than @xmath85 in the range of temperatures which are studied here . in the regime of full phase separation as it has been discussed in this study ( at rather low temperatures ) the size of the clusters does not depend on the block length @xmath0 for different number of blocks , when the normalization of figure  [ fig8 ] is chosen .",
    "below @xmath85 , full phase separation can not take place , a variation in the number of clusters is observed , and higher dependence is seen on the block length @xmath0 for higher number of clusters , until a plateau is reached for @xmath86 .",
    "this behaviour is rather universal for multiblock chains of different number of blocks .",
    "then , at @xmath44 our data show the same behaviour exhibiting an almost linear dependence on @xmath0 for all the cases of different @xmath1 .",
    "however , for small number of blocks length ( @xmath87 ) the curve is shifted . for higher values of blocks @xmath1 this shift is smaller as this number of blocks increases .",
    "this behaviour is compatible with the picture obtained from overall properties , as it is , for example , the density profiles of figure  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "it is interesting to augment our discussion by dividing our data by the number of blocks ( @xmath5 , figure  [ fig9 ] ) . at lower temperatures ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) a universal boundary between two linear regimes",
    "is seen ; when @xmath0 is small i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "then a different regime is reached , where a linear dependence with a different slope from the first linear regime is seen . as the temperature increases close to @xmath7 , where the clusters are mainly composed by individual blocks",
    ", we can clearly see a single linear behaviour extending over all the considered block lengths @xmath0 . when the number of blocks @xmath1 is small , the slope describing the dependence on the block length @xmath0 is higher . in this",
    "case blocks of monomers of the same type have higher probability to cluster occasionally .",
    "as the number of blocks @xmath1 increases , this probability of occasional clustering globally decreases as the number of unfavorable interactions decrease .",
    "such a linear behaviour shows that that the blocks individually behave `` locally '' like homopolymer chains , and it is only the a - b contacts between connected blocks that control such behaviour .",
    "plots like figure  [ fig9 ] provide an indication of the proximity of the @xmath7 temperature for the chains .",
    "in this study , we have investigated the static properties of a single multiblock copolymer chain under poor solvent conditions .",
    "the interactions were chosen symmetrically , as well as the structural parameters of the chains , i.e. , the length of the blocks with monomers of type a or b were equal , and the number of blocks a was equal to the number of blocks b , while the blocks of different type alternated along the chain .",
    "we used standard molecular dynamics simulations of a bead - spring model for our simulations , and we focused our discussion on the dependence of the size of the cluster formations occurring at low temperatures on the varied parameters , i.e. , the block length @xmath0 , the number of blocks @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath2 which was used to tune the quality of the solvent .",
    "our analysis was presented in the context of recent results on the phase behaviour of such macromolecules .",
    "we showed that the number of contacts at the interface between a and b monomers , in the case where the multiblock copolymer chain at a low temperature ( e.g. , @xmath27 ) is always split in two microphase separated clusters composed of blocks of the same type of monomers , varies linearly with the number of blocks and it is lower than @xmath72 ( @xmath65 was kept constant ) .",
    "accordingly , we studied the dependence of the clusters size on the temperature discussing our results in the context of recent results on the phase behaviour of such macromolecules",
    ". we could clearly distinguish the different regimes relating to the different phase behaviours .",
    "the dimensions of the clusters as a function of the number of blocks @xmath1 and the block length @xmath0 were independently studied .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the dependence of the clusters size on the @xmath1 was given , discussing also the effect of the temperature .",
    "furthermore , we showed ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) that our data collapse onto a single curve when the chains leave the collapsed state and gradually adopt coil - like conformations .",
    "thus , we could use such plots to identify this boundary .",
    "this occurs at temperature @xmath51 .",
    "then , the dependence of the size of the formed clusters on the block length @xmath0 was presented .",
    "we showed that at lower temperature the collapsed state results in two different linear regimes with a smooth crossover between them . at temperatures close to @xmath7 temperature a linear dependence on the block length @xmath0",
    "is seen for all block lengths with a different slope , i.e. , as the number of blocks increases , there is a smaller dependence on the block length @xmath0 , when the data for gyration radius are normalized with the number of blocks .",
    "our results , in combination with recent results on the phase behaviour of symmetric linear multiblock copolymers , provide a complete picture of the behaviour of the cluster formations in such macromolecules for the range of parameters accessible to simulations ."

    "<S> we study the dependence of the size of the formed clusters on @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss our results with respect to recent simulation data on the phase behaviour of such macromolecules , providing a complete picture for the cluster formations in single multiblock copolymer chains under poor solvent conditions . </S>"
