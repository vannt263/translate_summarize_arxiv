    "the study of the three - dimensional or the intrinsic transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( 3dpdfs or tmds ) has received much attention in recent years  @xcite .",
    "such new quantities of the nucleon provide us a significant perspective on understanding the three - dimensional structure of hadrons and the non - perturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "azimuthal asymmetries of unpolarized and single polarized drell ",
    "yan processes are among the most challenging issues of qcd spin physics  @xcite .",
    "the first measurement of the angular distribution of drell  yan process , performed by na10 collaboration for @xmath13 , indicates a sizable @xmath3 azimuthal asymmetry  @xcite which can not be described by leading and next - to - leading order perturbative qcd  @xcite .",

    "the drell  yan process is an ideal ground for testing the perturbative qcd and for probing the 3dpdfs or tmds , as it contains only the distribution functions with no fragmentation functions , and its differential cross section is well described by next - to - leading order qcd calculations  @xcite . in this paper , we calculate azimuthal asymmetries of @xmath0 and @xmath1 dilepton production processes in drell  yan continuum region and around the @xmath4-pole through a fixed - target experiment using the lhc proton beams with the proton or deuteron target unpolarized and transversally or longitudinally polarized . the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 and 3",
    ", we respectively calculate the azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarized and single polarized @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes . in sect .  4 , we present the numerical results of these asymmetries .",
    "then , a brief discussion and conclusion is contained in sect .",
    "the drell  yan process is an ideal ground to investigate the hadron structure , because it only probes the parton distributions without fragmentation functions .",
    "it was naively speculated that the polarization of at least one incoming hadron is necessary to investigate the spin - related structure and properties of hadrons .",
    "however , it is not the case if we take the intrinsic transversal momentum of quarks inside the hadron into account . as mentioned before , the standard perturbative qcd to leading and next - to - leading order failed to describe the sizable @xmath3 azimuthal asymmetry and the lam ",

    "therefore , it was thought to be forbidden for a long time because of the time - reversal invariance property of qcd  @xcite .",
    "however the model calculations taken by brodsky , hwang and schmidt indicated that these non - vanished naively @xmath23-odd distribution functions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can arise from the final or initial state interaction between the struck quark and the target remnant in the sidis and drell  yan processes at leading - twist level  @xcite .",
    "in general , the path - order wilson line , which arises from the requirement of a full qcd gauge invarient definition of 3dpdfs or tmd distribution functions , provides non - trivial phases and leads to non - vanished @xmath23-odd distribution functions  @xcite . due to the present of the wilson line , opposite sign of boer  mulders function or sivers function in sidis and drell  yan processes is expected  @xcite @xmath24 this relation still awaits for experimental confirmation . for hadron productions in hadron ",

    "<S> a multi - purpose fixed - target experiment using the proton and lead - ion beams of the lhc was recently proposed by brodsky , fleuret , hadjidakis and lansberg , and here we concentrate our study on some issues related to the spin physics part of this project ( referred to as after ) . </S>",
    "<S> we study the nucleon spin structure through @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes with a fixed - target experiment using the lhc proton beams , for the kinematical region with 7  tev proton beams at the energy in center - of - mass frame of two nucleons @xmath2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate and estimate the @xmath3 azimuthal asymmetries of unpolarized @xmath0 and @xmath1 dilepton production processes in the drell  yan continuum region and at the @xmath4-pole . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 azimuthal asymmetries of @xmath0 and @xmath1 dilepton production processes with the target proton and deuteron longitudinally or transversally polarized in the drell  yan continuum region and around @xmath4 resonances region . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is feasible to measure these azimuthal asymmetries , consequently the three - dimensional or transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions ( 3dpdfs or tmds ) , at this new after facility . </S>"
