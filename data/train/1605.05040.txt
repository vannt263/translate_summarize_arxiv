    "this paper describes the development and application of a relativistic model for atomic structure .",
    "the basic strategy of the model is to partition the atom into valence and core electrons .",
    "the core electrons will be represented by orbitals obtained from dirac - fock calculations .",
    "the wave function for the valence electrons will be computed by expanding the wave function as a linear combination of laguerre function spinors ( l - spinors ) and slater function spinors ( s - spinors )  @xcite .",
    "the direct and exchange interactions between the core and valence electrons can be computed without approximation .",
    "core - valence correlations can be represented by simply introducing semi - empirical core polarization potentials which are tuned to ensure that the energies for the valence electrons agree with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this methodology is based on the success of similar methodologies in computing atomic properties of light atoms , namely non - relativistic configuration interaction with a semi - empirical core potential method ( cicp )  @xcite . as a recent example , the dipole polarizability of the si@xmath11 ion computed with a similar methodology is @xmath12  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of a resonant excitation stark ionization spectroscopy ( resis )  @xcite experiment give @xmath14  @xmath13  @xcite while a very sophisticated relativistic configuration interaction with many body perturbation theory calculation ( mbpt ) gave @xmath15  @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "numerous other examples of very good agreement of the semi - empirical method with the most advanced _ ab - initio _ theoretical models for oscillator strengths and polarizabilities can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are a number of reasons for the success of the relativistic semi - empirical approach .",
    "firstly , this approach is based on the _ ab - initio _ dirac - fock ( df ) calculation to define the core .",
    "secondly , tuning energies to experimental values leads to wave functions that have the correct asymptotic decay at long distances from the nucleus .",
    "the multipole matrix elements needed for oscillator strength and polarizability calculations tend to be dominated by the large-@xmath16 form of the wave function .",
    "finally , partitioning the wave function into frozen - core electrons and an active valence electron reduces the equation for the wave function and energies into one equation that admits a close to exact numerical solution , here using a large ( orthogonal ) laguerre basis .",
    "it should be noted that the df+core - polarization method adopted here has been extensively used by migdalek and co - workers to calculate the oscillator strengths of many atoms  @xcite .",
    "they solved the radial equations numerically  @xcite , and they typically restricted their transitions to between those of the low - lying states . here , we employ basis sets which enables the calculation of transition matrix elements between both the bound states and the continuum ( pseudostates ) .",
    "this enables us here to compute atomic polarizabilities  @xcite , where the continuum makes a significant contribution  @xcite .",
    "the present work gives a brief description of the strategy adopted to convert an existing non - relativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) program  @xcite into a relativistic df program .",
    "next , the technical details for performing calculations for one valence electron atoms and ions are discussed .",
    "these methods are then applied to the solution of hydrogen and hydrogenic atoms as a test for evaluation .",
    "the main results presented are the oscillator strengths , and static and dynamic polarizabilities for the low - lying states of sr@xmath4 ions .",
    "in addition some of the magic wavelengths for @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions are presented , at which the ac - stark shift of the transition energy is zero .",
    "the static polarizabilities of sr@xmath4 can be used to estimate frequency shifts of @xmath18 clock transitions due to background fields such as blackbody radiation shifts  @xcite .",
    "the magic wavelengths can be used , for example , for high - precision trapping measurements  @xcite",
    "the single - electron dirac equation can be written as , @xmath19 where the hamiltonian @xmath20 @xmath21 is the momentum operator , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24 matrices of the dirac operators  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 represents the valence electron - core electrons interaction , and is described shortly .",
    "we have two separate codes that we present the first results from here .",
    "the first is the df calculation , which generates the closed - shell orbitals using purely slater - type orbitals .",
    "the second code solves for a single valence electron orbiting the closed - shell using a mixture of the slater - type orbitals produced by the first code with additional laguerre - type orbitals to describe the valence electronic structure and continuum physics .",
    "the starting point of a calculation involving closed shells is the df calculation for the core state of the atoms .",
    "the df equations are closely related to the hf equations . the atomic schrdinger hamiltonian is replaced by the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian and the single particle orbitals are now 4-component spinors with a large and a small component .",
    "the strategy used to generate a df wave function is to adapt an existing hf program  @xcite which expands the orbitals as a linear combination of slater ( or gaussian ) type orbitals .",
    "the first stage of the modification is to generate the angular representation of the orbitals from @xmath26 representation .",
    "the next stage is to write each orbital in terms of @xmath27-spinors .",
    "each orbital wavefunction can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relativistic angular quantum number which is connected to the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath30 and the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath31 , @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the large and small components of radial wavefunction , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the angular components .    the radial wavefunctions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are expanded as @xmath37-terms in an s - spinor basis @xmath38 where the superscript @xmath39 and @xmath40 identify the ",
    "large \" and  small \" components of the dirac spinor in a conventional way .",
    "although it is common to formally sub - divide the basis functions into small and large type functions and explicitly recognize this when casting the df equations into operational form  @xcite , that approach is not adopted in the present paper .",
    "instead , each orbital has a label identifying it as being of a large or small component in the present code .",
    "these labels are taken into account when computing the matrix elements of the df hamiltonian .",
    "this approach is adopted since minimal modifications are needed for those parts of the program that construct and diagonalize the hamiltonian . in effect , information about the spinor construction is confined to those parts of the program that evaluate the matrix elements of the basis functions .",
    "s - spinors are generalizations of slater type orbitals ( sto ) adapted to relativistic systems .",
    "the first modification is the inclusion of a radial @xmath41 pre - factor with @xmath42 to ensure these functions have the correct asymptotic form at origin . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the atomic number and we adopt @xmath44 as the speed of light ( in atomic units ) .",
    "the second modification includes choosing the large and small component basis functions to approximately satisfy the kinetic balance condition  @xcite .",
    "the unnormalized radial components are written as , @xmath45 for orbitals with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for orbitals with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 for the large components and @xmath50 for the small components .      a df basis set is formed as a collection of s - spinors with positive real exponents @xmath51 and coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 . that undergo variational optimization .",
    "the s - spinor for the orbitals with @xmath55 has a very simple form .",
    "the radial prefactor did not allow for additional powers of @xmath16 as prefactors .",
    "this is distinct from the related sto basis sets used for non - relativistic calculations which usually have radial prefactors with a variety of powers of @xmath16  @xcite . in our calculations , the s - spinor basis sets used",
    "are based on non - relativistic basis sets .",
    "an sto basis with all functions restricted to @xmath56 was optimized for the non - relativistic calculation .",
    "once the optimization was complete , this was modified by the replacement @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 for s - spinors .",
    "this is based on the form of the exact wave functions for @xmath46 .",
    "no further minor optimizations is undertaken as the relativistic scf calculations are time comsuming to do .",
    "table  [ tab : dfenergies ] gives df energies computed using s - spinor basis and numerical df energies computed using grasp92  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the two sets of energies are in agreement with each other to at least six significant digits .",
    "note that grasp92 uses a finite difference method , so such differences are expected .",
    "see supplemental table  i , table  ii , and table  iii for lists of the basis exponents .",
