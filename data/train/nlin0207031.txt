    "an osfr is made of a film of a chemically resistant gel , of uniform thickness @xmath1 .",
    "one face is kept in contact with the homogeneous contents of a continuous stirred tank reactor ( cstr ) .",
    "the other face is pressed against an impermeable wall ( fig .",
    "[ osfr ] ) .",
    "the coupled dynamical equations for the concentrations in the cstr and in the gel are respectively @xcite : @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the concentrations of species @xmath7 respectively in the input flow , in the cstr , and inside the gel , @xmath8 is the corresponding diffusion coefficient , @xmath9 the residence time of the reactor ,",
    "@xmath10 the ratio of the volume of the gel to the volume of the cstr , and @xmath11 the distance to the cstr / gel interface .",
    "the @xmath12 s are the reaction rates . in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqcstr ] ) , the three terms represent the change of the concentrations per time unit .",
    "the first term gives the contribution of the reaction .",
    "the second one represents the input and output flows of the species .",
    "it contains all the expandable control parameters of the system , namely @xmath9 and the @xmath4 .",
    "the third term results from the diffusive flux of the species at the interface between the gel and the cstr and represents the feedback of the gel contents on the cstr dynamics .",
    "when the volume of the cstr is large in regard to the volume of the gel ( @xmath13 ) , this last term can generally be dropped so that the chemical state of the cstr is independent of the state of the gel and the concentrations in the cstr define a dirichlet boundary condition for eq .",
    "( [ eqgel ] ) at @xmath14 , whereas a no - flux boundary condition is applied at @xmath15 . to avoid ambiguities ,",
    "let us make more precise the terms we use .",
    "whereas in usual osfrs the thickness @xmath1 is small in regard to the two other dimensions , in this paper , we want to investigate the behavior of the system along the direction orthogonal to the faces in contact with the cstr and the impermeable wall .",
    "thus , we shall consider systems made of ` flat ' gels in which one of the dimensions parallel to these faces ( @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ osfr ] ) is still smaller and negligible .",
    "such systems can be considered as two - dimensional .",
    "nevertheless , the size @xmath1 , in the direction orthogonal to the faces , remains small in regard to the second direction parallel to these faces .",
    "size @xmath1 and the direction orthogonal to the faces will be further referred to as the ` depth ' or the ` width ' of the gel , the negligible dimension @xmath16 becoming the ` thickness ' .    a number of reactions which present autocatalytic steps are bistable in a cstr @xcite .",
    "these reactions normally exhibit ` clock ' behavior in batch conditions , i.e. a more or less long induction period followed by a fast switch to the equilibrium . in these reactions ,",
    "the transformation rate of the substrate(s ) tremendously increases during the switch which occurs when the level of the autocatalytic species is large enough . for residence times much shorter than the typical reaction time ,",
    "i.e. at high flow rates , the composition inside the cstr is close to the composition in the input flow .",
    "it is referred as the ` flow state ' or state f. for residence times much larger than the typical reaction time , i.e. at low flow rates , the reaction is almost completed in the cstr and the composition in the cstr is close to a thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this is referred as the ` thermodynamic state ' or state t. for intermediate flow rates , both states are stable for the same composition of the input flows .",
    "spatial bistability can be observed when such a reaction is operated in an osfr , the cstr of which is set in the flow state .",
    "although this phenomenon , which extends the concept of bistability to space , has been previously described in simple models @xcite and in real experiments @xcite , its importance has been recognized only recently and a detailed analysis was worked out in relation with the development of the osfrs @xcite .    to understand the basic principles of spatial bistability , let us consider the concentration profile of a substrate of concentration @xmath17 and diffusion coefficient @xmath18 consumed in the reaction and let us imagine that the depth @xmath1 of the gel can be changed in a continuous way .",
    "the time taken by fresh reactants fed by diffusion at the cstr boundary to reach the opposite boundary is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "we start from @xmath20 and increase @xmath1 adiabatically so that the system is always in its asymptotic stationary state .",
    "let @xmath21 be the induction time for the cstr composition ( in state f ) . while @xmath1 is small enough for @xmath22 to hold , the whole volume of the gel remains in state f. we shall still refer this state of the gel as a f state .",
    "when @xmath23 reaches a value of the order of @xmath21 , for a value @xmath24 , the fast reaction starts at the impermeable wall and a steep front connecting the f state to a t state forms .",
    "such a state will be referred as a ` mixed state ' or ft state .",
    "but , the amount of the autocatalytic species is now large at the impermeable wall of the gel ( @xmath15 ) and can diffuse backwards switching on the reaction , so that the front can recede to a value @xmath25 .",
    "actually , if one assumes that the reaction rate is extremely large inside the front , one can neglect the rate of the consumption of the substrate elsewhere and the concentration of the latter can be approximated by the solution of a diffusion equation between a fixed value at @xmath14 ( the cstr ) and @xmath26 ( the front ) .",
    "then , it can easily be shown that : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total amount of substrate converted by time unit in the gel and @xmath29 is the variation of concentration between the f and the t states @xcite .",
    "this value is practically independent of @xmath1 , so that one can now decrease @xmath1 down to a value @xmath30 before the system switches back from the ft to the f state .",
    "thus , for @xmath31 , both concentrations profiles f and ft are stable .",
    "this defines the spatial bistability .",
    "the extent of the bistability domain depends on the concentrations in the cstr  always close to those in the input flow  and the residence time , so that various nonequilibrium phase diagrams can be built @xcite . in spite of its apparent crudeness ,",
    "this theory gives accurate results .",
    "extensive studies have been performed experimentally and numerically on the chlorine dioxide - iodide ( cdi ) reaction . up to now , differences in diffusion coefficients did not seem to play any role .",
    "actually , whether the system is ruled by equal diffusion coefficients or by long range inhibition , it exhibits a standard spatial bistability .",
    "we shall see that the situation is fairly more complex when long range activation comes into play .",
    "the chlorite - tetrathionate ( c - t ) reaction has essentially been studied in closed systems for the determination of stoichiometric and kinetic aspects @xcite as well as a source for propagating cellular fronts @xcite . in excess of chlorite ,",
    "the reaction kinetics is well approximated by the following overall balance equation @xmath32 and the reaction rate by @xmath33}}{{\\rm d } t } } = k\\mbox{[clo$_2 ^ -$][s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$][h$^+$]$^2 $ } \\label{kinlaw}\\ ] ] since , during the reaction , large ph changes are observed , the fast dissociation equilibria of @xmath34 and @xmath35 have also to be accounted for .",
    "this rate law exhibits quadratic autocatalysis in [ @xmath36 .",
    "although the validity of this rate law has been determined for a limited range of ph ( 4.7 - 5.5 ) @xcite , it has been successfully used in much larger domains . nevertheless , the original value @xmath37  m@xmath38s@xmath39 had to be adjusted to fit with experiments . the value @xmath40  m@xmath38s@xmath39 has recently been proposed to fit the experimental data of the bistability domain of the reaction in a cstr @xcite and will be used in the following .    it is well known that , whereas most species have a diffusion coefficient close to 10@xmath41  @xmath42s@xmath39 , the autodiffusion coefficient of the proton h@xmath0 is almost ten times larger . nevertheless , accounting for the electroneutrality condition and the presence of the slowest ions , the effective diffusion of h@xmath0 is lower @xcite .",
    "solving reaction - diffusion equations that include all ionic effects is a formidable task which has been only performed on simple models @xcite . for practical reasons ,",
    "it is reasonable to use a constant and uniform effective value for each diffusion coefficient .",
    "we shall assume that all diffusion coefficients are equal to a unique effective value @xmath43 , except for h@xmath0 and oh@xmath44 which have both a higher autodiffusion coefficient and are closely related .",
    "let @xmath45 be a common value for these two species . with these assumptions , it was shown in ref @xcite that the experimental data can be correctly interpreted only if @xmath46 ranges slightly above 3 .",
    "thus it is necessary to take into account that the autocatalytic species h@xmath0 diffuses much faster than the inhibitory species , so that the reaction - diffusion system enters the class of long range activation .      in order to make extensive computations",
    ", we shall first define a simple model , the properties of which are close enough to the original system to draw significant conclusions .",
    "our main purpose is that , due to its formal simplicity , this model can be further used as a prototype for long range activation .",
    "the model relies on two strong assumptions : a ) the kinetics is completely described by eqs .",
    "( [ kin ] , [ kinlaw ] ) .",
    "b ) the concentrations at the cstr boundary are fixed to their values in the input flow , i.e. we assume a residence time @xmath47 ( infinite flow rate ) . in these conditions ,",
    "the reaction - diffusion system is : @xmath48[{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}][{\\mbox{\\rm h$^+$}}]^2 + d_1\\nabla^2[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$ } } ] \\nonumber \\\\ { \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}}{\\partial t } } & = & -2k[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}][{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}][{\\mbox{\\rm h$^+$}}]^2 + d_1\\nabla^2[{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$ } } ] \\label{model1}\\\\ { \\frac{\\partial { \\mbox{\\rm h$^+$}}}{\\partial t } } & = & 12k[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}][{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}][{\\mbox{\\rm h$^+$}}]^2 + d_2\\nabla^2[{\\mbox{\\rm h$^+$ } } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper , we do not consider short transients that follow a change of parameters and only consider the asymptotic regime . eliminating the reaction term between the two first equations , one is left with a diffusion equation with a fixed boundary condition at @xmath14 . in the long time limit , the solution is @xmath49 - 7[{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}]=2[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}]_0 - 7[{\\mbox{\\rm s$_4$o$_6^{2-}$}}]_0 $ ] , where index 0 holds for the concentrations fixed at the boundary .",
    "then [ ] can be expressed as a function of [ ] and can be eliminated from eqs .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) .",
    "one gets the two - variable reduced system : @xmath50 where we have introduced the new time and space scales @xmath51_0)^3t$ ] , @xmath52_0)^{3/2}r$ ] and the following normalized variables and parameters : @xmath53/[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}]_0 $ ] , @xmath54/[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}]_0 $ ] , @xmath46 and @xmath55_0/[{\\mbox{\\rm clo$_2 ^ -$}}]_0 $ ] .",
    "this system is formerly identical to the system used in previous studies in closed systems @xcite . according to the definition of @xmath56",
    ", one has @xmath57 at the cstr boundary .",
    "thus , the control parameters are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , where @xmath58 is the fixed value of @xmath61 at the cstr boundary .",
    "parameter @xmath60 represents the normalized excess of chlorite .",
    "provided it is not too large  this is the case in most experiments  it was found to play a minor role in the model and does not bring qualitative changes in the results .",
    "thus , it was fixed at @xmath62 which would correspond to exact stoichiometric proportions of chorite and tetrathionate .",
    "note that , if @xmath63 , the third equation could be eliminated in the same way and the system would be reduced to a unique variable @xmath56 .",
    "a similar reduction to the same one - variable equation could also be done for a homogeneous cstr .",
    "a one variable system can be bistable but never oscillating or excitable , since two dynamical time scales at least are necessary .",
    "this suggests that the c - t reaction can be neither oscillating or excitable in a cstr .",
    "more sophisticated models support this assertion , which is confirmed by experiments .",
    "this model suffers from serious limitations .",
    "first , at the cstr boundary , we use fixed concentrations equal to the concentrations in the input flow . since , in the flow state , the concentrations should be close to those in the input flows , this seems to be a reasonable approximation . nevertheless , at finite residence times , the values of @xmath58 could correspond to non existent or unstable states of the cstr .",
    "the approximation is strictly valid only in the practically unreachable limit of infinite flow rates ( @xmath47 ) . in the same way",
    ", one can fix @xmath58 to arbitrary high values for which the cstr would necessarily be in a t state .",
    "this can lead to ambiguities in the definition of the spatial states f and t and to experimentally unreachable regions in phase diagrams so that some care is necessary for their interpretations .",
    "finally , values of @xmath58 can also be taken arbitrary low , down to zero , an unrealistic situation since the dissociation equilibrium of water imposes that @xmath64 $ ] remains positive and finite .",
    "thus , this model must be only thought as a ` toy model ' , with the advantage that the kinetics remains closely related to that of a real system .",
    "this will allow us to evidence dynamical phenomena induced by long range activation .",
    "such models have also been recently used by benyaich et al . in studies of spatial bistability @xcite . to make direct comparison with experiments ,",
    "a more elaborated model has to be devised .      to avoid oddities due to the simple model oversimplifications",

    "accurate one - dimensional numerical solutions of the resulting reaction - diffusion system have been obtained by an implicit finite difference method for stiff systems with adaptative grid in time and space .",
    "unfortunately , due to the higher complexity and the extreme stiffness of the model , it was impossible to make systematic studies of this model in higher dimensions .",
    "two - dimensional computations were limited to a few points in parameter space . in order to avoid problems in the definition of the input concentrations and to make easier the comparisons with the experimental data and a previous work , we use , as the main control parameter , the quantity @xmath81 defined in the experimental section below .      in order to resolve the concentration profiles in the depth @xmath1 of the reactor and to minimize both technical difficulties and parasitic edge effects ,",
    "we have developed one - side - fed flat annular reactors , i.e. annular osfrs .",
    "complete descriptions and technical details on such reactors can be found in ref .",
    "these osfrs are made of a flat annular piece of 2% agarose gel , of thickness @xmath820.5 mm .",
    "they have a fixed outer radius @xmath83=12.5  mm and an inner radius @xmath84 such that the width @xmath85 ranges from 0.5 to 3  mm .",

    "the diffusion coefficients are close to those in pure water .",
    "the ratio @xmath86 is large enough for the curvature effects to be negligible .",
    "the inner rim of the annulus is tighten against the impermeable boundary while the outer rim is in contact with the contents of a cstr of 25  @xmath87 , fed through a single inlet port with appropriately premixed solutions of reagents stored in separated reservoirs .",

    "this is done by pumping different volume ratios of acid and base , keeping the overall flow rate constant . for experimental and graphic convenience",
    ", this relative distribution is characterized by a control parameter @xmath81 on which the acid and base flow concentrations depend linearly : one has [ hclo@xmath92]@xmath94 = @xmath97  m and [ naoh]@xmath94 = @xmath98  m. the ph of the feed mixture decreases from a basic to an acid state as @xmath81 increases from 0 to 1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 effectively controls the ph of the solution and is the only expandable control parameter in this series of experiments .",
    "the patterns are made visible by bromophenol blue ( 1% solution ) , a ph sensitive indicator that turns from dark purple in the basic state to pale yellow in the acid state .",
    "patterns are monitored by a ccd camera connected to a time lapse video recorder .",
    "the dynamics of the c - t reaction operated in the cstr exhibits bistability in the range @xmath99 between a f branch ( with ph values typically above 9 ) and a t branch ( with ph values typically below 3 ) .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to the value of @xmath81 where the input flow switches from a basic to an acid solution .",
    "the lower limit was used to adjust the rate constant @xmath100 to the value @xmath40",
    "m@xmath38s@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in the preliminary experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we had observed , in addition to spatial bistability , oscillations of the ft state front and excitability phenomena in the domain where the sole f state is stable .",
    "while the stability of concentration profiles can be determined with 1-d simulations , the latter needs 2-d computations .",
    "thus , the stability limits are determined in 1-d calculations by the same accurate implicit method as the full model and the existence of excitability domain is studied in two dimensional simulations , performed with two different numerical methods , namely an implicit finite difference hopscotch method with automatic step control and a finite element method .",
    "first , choosing a typical depth value @xmath101 ( expressed in reduced units precedently defined ) , we have built a stability diagram in the plane @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "[ diagdv ] ) .    at low values of @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ", there is a large region of spatial bistability that extends down to @xmath103 . when @xmath104 the ` acid ' state must obviously be obtained by a continuous decrease of @xmath58 from another ` acid ' state or by an acid perturbation of the system . in fig .",
    "[ proftoy ] ,    we have represented the two stable concentration profiles through the depth of the gel for a given set of control parameters .",
    "contrary to the standard case , in the ft state , these profiles are always monotonous and do not exhibit a steep front .",
    "the states are nevertheless well characterized by the low ( ` basic ' ) or high ( ` acid ' ) value of @xmath61 at @xmath15 , the impermeable boundary of the gel .",
    "when @xmath105 , the system exhibits temporal oscillations in place of bistability .",
    "since the system can not oscillate in homogeneous conditions , these oscillations clearly result from the different time scales introduced by the differential diffusion .",
    "although the problem is of spatial nature , the stability limits present the characteristic topology of the so - called ` cross - shaped diagram ' that connects bistability and oscillations of numerous reactions in homogeneous conditions @xcite .",
    "a second diagram in the plane @xmath106 has been extensively computed for @xmath59=5.5 , a value chosen for the richness of the dynamical situations exhibited at this diffusion ratio ( fig .",
    "[ diagvl ] ) . for small depths , the system is always in the flow ( or ` basic ' ) state , as expected . at intermediate values of depth , there is a large domain of oscillations .",
    "it vanishes at large @xmath58 values for which one continuously changes from the ` basic ' to the ` acid ' state when @xmath1 is increased . for large depths ,",
    "the ft ( or ` acid ' ) state is again present down to @xmath103 , which defines a domain of spatial bistability at small @xmath58 values .",
    "the most interesting part of this diagram is the region labeled ` bist.2 ' in fig .",
    "[ diagvl](b ) . in this narrow region ,",
    "the system still exhibits spatial bistability , but the ` acid ' state becomes oscillating .",
    "thus , the bistability domain is divided in two regions , one of standard bistability between two stationary concentration profiles ( ` bist.1 ' ) , and a second one between a stationary profile and an oscillating one ( ` bist.2 ' ) . moreover ,",
    "when one decreases @xmath1 and crosses the stability limit of the oscillatory ` acid ' state , the unique stable state , namely the f ( ` basic ' ) state , exhibits particular properties .",
    "if , in this stable state , an acid perturbation ( such as @xmath107 ) is applied close to the impermeable wall , the perturbation does not smoothly decay to the stable state but stimulates a further increase of @xmath108 ions concentration in its vicinity . a pair of pulses forms and propagates along the wall in opposite directions .",

    "when @xmath81 decreases from the onset of oscillations , the period of the oscillations slowly increases . on the contrary , the period strongly increases when the width @xmath1 increases . since the experimental conditions are never strictly uniform all along the outer rim of the gel and since the width @xmath1 can not be perfectly constant , the oscillations of the front lead to the formation of pacemakers that emit travelling waves with periods comparable to those found in the computations .    beyond the stability limit of the ft front ,",
    "dynamical phenomena persist in the form of excitability . in a large domain of parameters , an acid perturbation , made at a localized place of the gel annulus , propagates under the form of two opposite travelling pulses along the inner rim .",
    "after a short transient , each pulse takes a stationary shape and travels without deformation along the annulus ( fig .",
    "[ excit ] ) .",
    "= 0.3 mm , @xmath81=0.48.,width=302 ]    the length of the pulse tail decreases as @xmath81 decreases until the excitability is eventually lost .",
    "when the pulses meet , they anihilate each other , but by adding a basic perturbation at the right place and time , it is possible to kill one of the two pulses .",
    "then , the surviving pulse can rotate indefinitely along the annulus as previously done with the belousov - zhabotinski reaction , the paradigm of excitable reactions @xcite .",
    "this behavior is identical to that observed with the simple model and is also reproduced with the extended model for the two different sets of parameters that were checked for excitability .",
    "it is known that , in homogeneous bistable systems , the addition of a negative feedback that introduces a new time scale can induce oscillations . in the same way",
    ", excitability can arise from the coupling of a bistable subsystem that exhibits a s - shaped nulcline with the feedback dynamics of a recovery variable .",
    "our simple model has clearly shown that the additional time scales introduced by long range activation can play a similar role and are able to induce excitability and spatio - temporal oscillations in a system which can only be bistable in homogeneous conditions .",
    "when the diffusion of the activator is not significantly higher than the diffusion of the other species , the system can only exhibit spatial bistability .",
    "but , when the ratio @xmath59 becomes significantly larger than 1 , the system exhibits a domain of oscillations connected to the bistable region ; the diagram has a typical cross - shaped topology @xcite . in a narrow band within the bistability region ,",
    "the ` acid ' state can also become oscillatory .",
    "this is analog to the experimental observations and to the results produced by the extended model .",
    "moreover , an excitability region develops along the stability limit of the ft state . actually , there is no discontinuity between a stable ft state and an excitable pulse with an infinite recovery tail within the f state .",
    "one must be aware that the recovery is not controlled by a slow kinetic process imbedded in the reaction mechanism as for the belousov - zhabotinskii reaction , but by the diffusion process that rules the feed from the cstr boundary .",
    "thus , the excitability properties do not only depend on intrinsic quantities , i.e. the reaction rates and diffusion coefficients , but also on a geometrical characteristic of the reactor , namely the depth of the gel .",
    "nevertheless , although the simple model predicts that differential diffusion can induce oscillations of the ft state in the spatial bistability region and excitability of the f state , the global agreement with experimental data , as well as with the extended model , is not very good . except for some analogies in the left upper part of fig .",
    "[ diagvl ] , the shape of the diagrams is different .",
    "a first reason is that the regions located on the right side of the bistable and the ` basic ' domains , including the oscillation pocket , are not physically reachable .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath58 could not be maintained in the cstr with realistic residence times .",
    "the cstr would switch into a thermodynamic state . by the way , with this model",
    ", it is difficult to speak of a true ft state since the concentration profiles do not exhibit any front .",
    "this is why we prefer to use the terms ` basic ' or ` acid ' rather than f and ft when speaking of the simple model .",
    "the second major reason is that oh@xmath44 and the autocatalytic species @xmath108 are related by a strong constraint independent of the c - t reaction itself , namely the fast equilibrium of water dissociation .",
    "this leads to buffering processes and excludes that @xmath58 takes values close to zero , as permitted by the simple model .",
    "thus this toy model , which allows for extensive numerical calculations , is an excellent tool to demonstrate the mechanisms of long range activation phenomena , but it should not be used for a precise analysis of the properties of the real system . in particular , it would be illusive to try to connect quantitatively the model parameters with realistic quantities .    in the extended model , where the cstr dynamics is included , a direct comparison with experiments is possible .",
    "spatial bistability limits are in good agreement .",
    "there is nevertheless a point that deserves special attention .",
    "species @xmath111 and @xmath123 are the natural substrates , but since the system is fed with a basic solution , @xmath124 must be considered as another substrate in spite of its special relation with @xmath108 .",
    "since the diffusion coefficients of these substrates are not equal , there is an ambiguity in the choice of the species to be considered in the basic theory that leads to eq .",
    "( [ valdelta ] ) . fig .",
    "[ numprof ] clearly shows that the relevant species is @xmath124 .",
    "its concentration drops linearly down to very low values at the exact position of the front , whereas the other substrates do not exhibit a linear drop all the way down and their concentration is far from minimal at the position of the front .",
    "a natural explanation is that , although @xmath124 diffuses fast , @xmath108 reacts much faster with @xmath124 than with the other substrates .",
    "this defines the smallest @xmath122 value and controls the overall process .",
    "however , the tail of the concentration profiles of these other subtrates plays a role in the anticipation of the ft@xmath125f transition that is actually found in the computations .    like in the simple model , oscillations induced by the long range activation are observed .",
    "if one decreases @xmath81 within the bistability domain , the ft state becomes oscillatory when its stability limit is approached .",
    "the diagram is in good quantitative agreement with experimental observations .",
    "since oscillations are restricted to a narrow region of control parameters , the unavoidable small inhomogeneities along the annulus , make impossible to perform a fine analysis of this front dynamics . in the model , the complex oscillations and the period doubling sequence observed in the 1-d simulations",
    "can be understood using the following arguments .",
    "actually , coupled oscillators may present the same complex dynamical behavior .",
    "close to the onset of the oscillatory regime , the motion of the front exhibits simple periodicity .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations @xmath126 is small and the front remains located close to the cstr boundary .",
    "but when @xmath81 decreases , approaching the limits of existence of the ft state , this amplitude becomes larger and larger .",
    "when @xmath127 is of the order of @xmath1 , the impermeable wall acts as a reflector for the diffusive concentration fields .",
    "then , the front dynamics couples with itself , with delay and partial damping . this dynamics of coupled oscillators explains the observed dynamical complexity .    in spatial bistability , it is possible to prepare two regions of the reactors in the two different states f and ft side by side and to study the dynamics of the f / ft interface . in the standard case , the direction of propagation of this interface depends on the control parameters and changes within the bistability domain according to the relative stability of the two states f and ft as was experimentally shown with the cdi reaction @xcite . in the c - t reaction , this situation is radically different .",
    "because the fast diffusion of the autocatalytic species excites the medium ahead of the interface , the ft state propagates always into the f state , i.e. within the whole domain of spatial bistability .",
    "moreover , this behavior can persist beyond the stability limit of state ft .",
    "the f / ft interface still propagates into state f , but , since the ft state is now unstable , the system ultimately returns to the f state .",
    "this gives rise to a recovery tail that follows the interface .",
    "if the ratio of the diffusion of the activator to the diffusion of the main substrates is significantly larger than 1 ( here @xmath128 ) , the propagation of the ft state balances the return to the f state at the level of the interface . thus , the process goes on and a pulse can propagate without damping in time . if @xmath59 is smaller , or if the system is too far from the stability limit of the ft state , the return to the stable state dominates and the pulse dies .",
    "this explains the domain of excitability observed in the experiments and accounted for by the models .    despite the good agreement of the extended model results with experimental data",
    ", this model still presents some serious limitations .",
    "a major drawback of the extended model is the use of effective diffusion coefficients which neglects the ionic interactions .",
    "the main effect of such interactions is more likely to give different effective diffusion coefficients in the flow state and in the thermodynamic state . as a result",
    ", this should change the position of the front and the exact limits of the oscillatory and excitability domains , but we believe that our main conclusions should hold . from an experimental point on view , a severe limitation is the control of parameter uniformity along the annular gel / cstr boundary which makes the front oscillations to appear in the form of travelling waves .",
    "finally , it has been recently found experimentally that the kinetic mechanisms summarized by eq .",
    "( [ kin ] ) breaks down when the concentration of chlorite or tetrathionate are significantly increased @xcite .    beyond these first experimental observations",
    ", one can expect to control the front motion by a continuous change of the geometrical control parameter @xmath1 .",
    "experiments along these lines are presently in progress both numerically and experimentally ."
