    "a critical epoch in the evolution of the universe is the the post - recombination period during which the first stars form , affect their environment and help determine how the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ultimately becomes reionized .",
    "recent observations are beginning to constrain models of this epoch .",
    "the observation of quasars at redshifts as high as @xmath3 ( fan et  al .",
    "2000 ) with no accompanying gunn - peterson absorption trough in their spectra indicates that the onset of reionization occurs quite early ( @xmath4 ) and so the first generation of stars forms even earlier .",
    "observations of quasar spectra ( ellison et  al .  1999 ,",
    "ellison et  al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that metallicities possibly as high as @xmath5 may be present even in the low column density @xmath6 lyman alpha forest .",
    "this too may be indicative of an active period of pre enrichment of the igm by an early generation of stars ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "future multiwavelength observations may be sensitive probes of this star formation epoch and the subsequent onset of reionization .",
    "a partial list of proposed observations include direct imaging of quasars and star clusters at @xmath7 by the next generation space telescope ( haiman & loeb 1999 , barkana & loeb 2000 ) , absorption measurements in the 21 cm line using the square kilometer array to identify the first epoch of massive star formation ( tozzi et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and searches for secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background by the next generation of millimeter telescopes such as alma to constrain properties of the reionization epoch ( benson et  al .  2000 ) .",
    "thus it is important to understand what our best cosmological models predict for the evolution of these early star forming structures and what governs the amount of gas that can ultimately condense into stars .",
    "it has long been understood that a high redshift population of stars could form naturally in hierarchical models of structure formation . in these models",
    "small masses collapse first and later merge into larger structures .",
    "the ability of these objects to form stars depends on the ability of gas within these objects to cool radiatively , reduce pressure support , and condense .",
    "however , the first structures to become self - gravitating in these models would have temperatures @xmath8 , too cool for hi line cooling to be effective .",
    "the only other coolant available to gas with a primordial composition is molecular hydrogen .",
    "therefore it is the complex chemistry of h@xmath0  in these objects that controls whether the gas can condense to sufficiently high densities for star formation to take place .",
    "early analytical models of the collapse of the first small scale structures studied the effect of h@xmath0  cooling within highly idealized cloud geometries , typically a homogeneous gas cloud radiatively cooling while undergoing a uniform free fall collapse ( saslow & zipoy 1967 , peebles & dicke 1968 , hirasawa 1969 , matsudo et  al .",
    "1969 , hutchins 1976 , silk 1983 , palla et  al .",
    "1983 , lepp & shull 1984 , lahov 1986 ) .",
    "1-d simulations sought to improve upon these analytical estimates , but still had to impose the shape of the initial density profiles and mass of the virialized object as initial conditions within an assumed cloud geometry ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 , tegmark et  al .  1997 ,",
    "omukai & nishi 1998 , nishi et  al .  1998 , nakamura & umemura 1999 ) .",
    "haiman , thoul & loeb ( 1996 ) followed the dynamics of gas and cold dark matter and the h@xmath0  chemistry in a single , spherical density peak and showed the importance of shell crossing between the gas and dark matter in determining the fraction of mass within an object that could collapse and the minimum mass for collapse . in the same spirit tegmark et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) used top hat density profiles and a simplified collapse criterion , i.e. that the cooling time be less than the hubble time for the object right after virialization , to obtain rough estimates of the critical h@xmath0  mass fraction needed for cooling and the minimum mass ( as a function of virialization redshift ) that could produce it .",
    "however , the minimum mass to collapse determined in this way is strongly dependent on the h@xmath0  cooling function used .",
    "abel et  al .  ( 1998 ) and fuller & couchman ( 2000 ) recalculated this minimum mass for top hat density profiles using the tegmark et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) collapse criterion with updated h@xmath0   cooling functions ( lepp & shull 1983 and galli & palla 1998 , respectively ) and found that the minimum mass able to collapse ( at virialization redshifts @xmath9 ) was reduced by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "molecular hydrogen is fragile and easily photodissociated by photons whose energies lie below @xmath10 ( stecker & williams 1967 ) .",
    "thus even before reionization , radiation from the first stars could affect h@xmath0  abundances at large distances ( dekel & rees 1987 ) .",
    "haiman , rees , & loeb ( 1997 ) quantified this negative radiative feedback in more detail .",
    "they studied the collapse of homogeneous , spherical gas clouds in the presence of a soft uv photodissociating flux assuming both ionization and chemical equilibrium within the cloud to determine which masses could still collapse .",
    "haiman , abel & rees ( 1999 ) improved on that calculation by solving spherically symmetric radiative transfer coupled with the time dependent rate equations for the h@xmath0  chemistry across truncated isothermal spheres .",
    "they also modified the collapse criterion such that a structure was said to be able to collapse and form stars if at any time during the object s history the h@xmath0  cooling time in the core became less than the time elapsed since the core s formation .",
    "this allowed the fraction of h@xmath0  abundance required for cooling and collapse of the core to be lower in certain cases than previous estimates of the `` critical '' h@xmath0  fraction based on the tegmark et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) collapse criterion .",
    "analytical models that include a first population of ob - like stars have been used to probe the suppression of star formation elsewhere within the host cloud due to the destruction of h@xmath0  coolant by the direct radiation from the first stars ( omukai & nishi 1999 ; glover & brand 2000 ) .",
    "the major drawback affecting all of the above studies whether with or without radiative feedback is their one dimensional nature .",
    "hierarchical structure formation that predicts the growth of structure in and along filaments is inherently three dimensional . however , fully three dimensional simulations are computationally challenging due to the need for large dynamic range to model simultaneously the internal structure of the first star forming structures and the effects of gravitational tidal forces and merging on their growth .",
    "such 3-d simulations have only recently become computationally feasible .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) simulated the thermal history of the intergalactic medium and the population of first objects to collapse but had insufficient resolution to probe inside these first structures .",
    "abel et  al .  (",
    "1998 ) used a static nested grid approach and constrained realizations of @xmath11  @xmath12 primordial fluctuations in a cluster normalized scdm model to study when these structures were able to cool , but were also limited by spatial resolution ( @xmath13  kpc ) from probing deeply within the peaks .",
    "subsequent higher resolution 3-d simulations focused on the properties of a single collapsing cloud .",
    "bromm , coppi , & larson ( 1999 ) studied the fragmentation of a @xmath14 rotating disk under highly idealized initial conditions using a treesph code .",
    "fuller & couchman ( 2000 ) used an adaptive smoothing - kernal sph coupled to a p@xmath15 m gravity solver in a simulation box of comoving length @xmath16  kpc to investigate the properties of the first peak to collapse .",
    "however , because of the small box size they needed to impose an overdense cold dark matter cosmology to model the formation of the cloud within its host filament .",
    "the highest spatial and mass resolution self - consistent cosmological 3-d simulations to date of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds ( abel , bryan , & norman 1998 , 2000 ; norman , abel , & bryan 2000 ) use eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) techniques to achieve extremely large dynamic range ( currently @xmath17 ) .",
    "they start from cosmological initial conditions in a cluster normalized scdm model to study the detailed internal evolution of a single , collapsing cloud in interaction with its environment in a box with comoving length @xmath18  kpc .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of fully 3-d eulerian amr simulations of the formation and collapse of primordial pregalactic structure in a realistic @xmath1cdm  cosmology .",
    "this study expands upon previous work in several important ways .",
    "first , we use a larger simulation volume ( @xmath19  mpc@xmath15 comoving ) to model more accurately the gravitational tidal forces and effects of merging on the evolving structures .",
    "second , we introduce a simple model for radiative feedback .",
    "we analyze the collapse properties of individual peaks with and without the presence of this soft uv background and compare our results with previous 1-d studies .",
    "finally , we use the population of pregalactic objects evolving together in the most active structure forming region of our simulation to develop statistics on the fraction of gas that is able to cool due to the presence of h@xmath0  and the fraction of gas that is both cold and dense enough to be available for star formation as functions of cloud mass and the average soft uv radiation field it experiences .",
    "these statistics represent the key new result of this paper .",
    "the amount of gas available for star formation in pregalactic objects is a critical input parameter into recent semi - analytical attempts to model stellar feedback from the first stars on the intergalactic medium , subsequent structure formation , and the nature of reionization ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 , ciardi et  al .",
    "2000 , ferrara et  al .",
    "2000 , ciardi , ferrara , & abel 2000 ) .",
    "while we focus on the negative effect of radiation in this paper , it should be noted that positive feedback is possible if the first objects also emit high energy x - ray photons ( haiman , abel & rees 1999 ; oh 2000 ) .",
    "we will address this point in future work .",

    "[ sec : dataset ] we present the characteristics of the simulated data set of pregalactic objects identified in our simulations and used for further analysis . in section  [ sec : stats ] we use the data set as a whole to develop fitting formulaes for the fraction of gas that can cool , become dense and thus be available for star formation with and without the presence of a background h@xmath0  photodissociating flux . in section ",
    "[ sec : profile ] we use radial profiles to show the internal collapse characteristics of these structures .",
    "we consider both the time evolution of a single peak for a fixed background h@xmath0  photodissociating flux and also how the internal properties of a given cloud change at fixed redshift when the level of h@xmath0  photodissociating flux is varied .",
    "armed with these examples of the internal evolution and structure of the collapsing clouds , we discuss in section  [ sec : discussion ] the neglect of self - shielding and h@xmath20 photodetachment in our simulations and then use a simple analytical argument to illuminate the essential physics of the collapse .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "a self - consistent three dimensional cosmological simulation of the collapse of low mass ( @xmath21  @xmath22 ) protogalaxies at high redshift ( @xmath23 ) requires both large enough simulation volume to model the gravitational tidal forces at work during the formation epoch and high spatial ( and mass ) resolution to probe within the small collapsing clouds .",
    "one technique that has recently been able to achieve the large dynamic range necessary to shed light on the collapse and fragmentation of these first star producing structures is adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) .",
    "the three dimensional amr algorithm used in our simulations is described more fully elsewhere ( bryan 1999 ; bryan & norman 1997 , 1999 ; norman & bryan 1998 ) .",
    "briefly , the code uses an adaptive hierarchy of rectangular grid patches at various levels of resolution very similar to the algorithm described by berger & collela ( 1989 ) .",
    "each grid patch covers some region within its parent grid needing additional refinement and may itself become a parent grid to an even higher resolution child grid .",
    "we take the ratio of parent to child grid mesh spacing to be two .",
    "the dark matter is followed using methods similar to those presented by couchman ( 1991 ) and the gas hydrodynamics uses the artificial viscosity method of stone & norman ( 1992 ) .",
    "we use a flat , low matter density @xmath1cdm  model for our simulations with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the fraction of the critical energy density carried in nonrelativistic matter , baryons , and vacuum energy , respectively , @xmath33 is the dimensionless hubble parameter in units of @xmath34 kms@xmath35mpc@xmath35 , @xmath36 is the density fluctuation normalization in a sphere of radius @xmath37 mpc , and @xmath38 is the slope of the primordial density perturbation power spectrum .",
    "the parameters are chosen to provide good consistency with observation .",
    "the fluctuation normalization is consistent with the cmb quadrupole as measured by cobe ( bunn & white 1997 ) and also with observations of the number density of galaxy clusters ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath39 is consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis and the measured abundance of primordial deuterium ( copi , schramm , & turner 1995 ; burles & tytler 1998 ) , and @xmath32 is consistent with the upper limit ( @xmath40 ) of maoz & rix ( 1993 ) and the best fit parameters of ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) .",
    "the simulations are initialized at @xmath41 with density perturbations generated for the above @xmath1cdm  model using the eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) transfer functions in a comoving simulation volume of @xmath19  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "this simulation volume is large enough to ensure that the fundamental mode in the box remains linear at the lowest redshifts considered here .",
    "a low resolution run is used first to identify a region of active structure formation . in order to achieve high mass resolution in the region of interest the simulation",
    "is reinitialized with multiple static refinement levels surrounding the chosen region such that each successive static parent grid contains the lagrangian volume of its child grid .",
    "this results in a mass resolution in the initial conditions for the region of interest of @xmath42 for the gas ( dark matter ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , that region is allowed to dynamically refine so that the local jeans length is resolved at all times by at least four grid zones and no grid cell contains more than four times the initial gas mass element ( @xmath43 ) or ten times the initial dark matter element ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we limit the total refinement to @xmath45 levels within a @xmath46 top grid which results in a maximum dynamic range of @xmath47 .",
    "the comoving spatial resolution of @xmath48  pc at maximum refinement translates into a physical spatial resolution of @xmath49  pc ( @xmath50  pc ) at @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , respectively .",
    "we call a peak `` collapsed '' when it reaches maximal refinement .",
    "once this occurs , we still wish to follow the subsequent evolution of structure in the region , but are uninterested in the details of the collapsed peak . in order to prevent the peak from collapsing further ( which could cause numerical instabilities )",
    ", we introduce a form of artificial pressure support .",
    "this is done by defining , for each cell , an effective pressure which is the greater of the thermal pressure and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the baryon density in the cell , @xmath55 is the cell width on the finest level and @xmath56 is the usual mean mass per particle .",
    "the dimensionless constant @xmath57 is set to 100 , a value which spreads the mass over a spherical region with a radius of several cells .",
    "the form of this expression is chosen by matching the thermal energy and gravitational self - energy of the gas ; notice also that it results in a polytropic equation of state .",
    "we also smooth the gravitational potential by @xmath58 which helps to reduce the amplitude of the artificial pressure support required .",
    "although introducing artificial pressure support causes us to lose information about the detailed morphology of the inner @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath59 pc ( @xmath13 % of the virial radius ) of the peak after collapse , it should not affect the determination of cooled gas fractions in section  [ sec : stats ] since the cooling region lies outside of the collapsed h@xmath0  core .",
    "our data set consists of results from four simulations starting from identical cosmological initial conditions on the density fields .",
    "three of the simulations follow the nonequilibrium , time dependent evolution of nine chemical species ( h , h@xmath60 , he , he@xmath60 , he@xmath61 , e@xmath20 , h@xmath0  , h@xmath62 , h@xmath20 ) using the algorithm of anninos , et  al .",

    "( 1997 ) and galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "we use primarily the rate coefficients of abel et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) with the exception of rate coefficients for the processes @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 which are taken from shapiro & kang ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have also included the three - body process @xmath66 ( orel 1987 , palli et  al .  1983 ) , although its contribution is negligible at the densities considered in this work .",
    "the small post - recombination abundance of h@xmath0  in the intergalactic medium ( @xmath67 ) is too low for cooling to be effective .",
    "however , at the densities and temperatures in the interiors of collapsing proto - galactic clouds , h@xmath0  formation is catalyzed by h@xmath20 ions through the process @xmath68 @xmath69 and can reach abundances high enough to act as an efficient coolant allowing the first stars to form .",
    "once the first stars form , radiation above @xmath70  ev produced by these stars is quickly absorbed by the dense neutral hydrogen surrounding them .",
    "however , the intergalactic medium is optically thin to radiation below the hi ionization limit",
    ". this radiation escapes to form a soft ultraviolet background of radiation throughout neighboring regions with sufficient energy to photodissociate h@xmath0  by means of the solomon process @xmath71 thus inhibiting continued star formation ( haiman , abel & rees 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath72 is any of @xmath73 lyman - werner resonances in the energy range @xmath74  @xmath10 .",
    "we use a very simple model to investigate the negative feedback effects of this soft uv radiation .",
    "the radiation field is assumed to be constant throughout the simulation with mean photon energy of @xmath75 . in terms of the constant mean flux @xmath76 , the h@xmath0  photodissociation rate coefficient for the solomon process denoted in equation [ eq : solomon ] is ( abel , et  al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath77 we distinguish three of our simulations by different levels of this background flux , i.e. @xmath78 ( first structure formation ) , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ergs@xmath35@xmath81hz@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "these flux levels correspond to @xmath82 normalizations of the spectral intensity ( haiman , abel , & rees 1999 ) of @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ergs@xmath35@xmath81hz@xmath35sr@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we also include results from a fourth simulation that starts from the same cosmological initial conditions , but evolves only six species ( h , h@xmath60 , he , he@xmath60 , he@xmath61 , e@xmath20 ) representing the extreme case when destruction of molecular hydrogen is complete .",
    "we neglect the time dependent turn on and build - up of the soft radiative field .",
    "thus the uv radiation experienced by the collapsing structures may be interpreted as due either to `` direct '' , nearby sources or a more diffuse soft background .",
    "we also neglect the effect of self - shielding by the collapsing cores . as will be discussed more fully in section ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , this should have only a small affect on our results . in any case",
    "each of these neglected effects would tend to reduce the impact of the photodissociating flux on the collapsing clouds .",
    "thus our results for the simulations with @xmath86 and @xmath80 ergs@xmath35@xmath81hz@xmath35should be interpreted as representing the maximal suppression of structure formation at these flux levels .",
    "we also neglect the photo - detachment of h@xmath20 by the uv radiation field .",
    "one might argue that the presence of the radiative background might photo - detach h@xmath20 before it could catalyze h@xmath0  formation by the process given in equation [ eq : hminus2h2 ] .",
    "this could hinder the collapse of clouds by preventing the build - up of coolant in the protogalactic cores . while the photons clearly have sufficient energy ( @xmath87 ) to photo -",
    "detach h@xmath20 , we will show in section  [ sec : discussion ] that h@xmath20 photo - detachment is suppressed by at least two orders of magnitude relative to h@xmath0  formation at the temperatures , densities and uv background flux levels we consider .",
    "the locations of high density pregalactic clouds are identified in the simulations using the hop algorithm ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) acting on the dark matter density distribution .",
    "we find that the high density peaks form within and at the intersection of sheets and filaments as expected in any cold dark matter dominated cosmology ( abel , et  al .",
    "we choose the @xmath88 @xmath89 most massive peaks of the @xmath90 identified by hop at each redshift for further analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig : mvir_z ] we present the mass of these clouds as a function of redshift for the simulation without h@xmath0  . since we use identical initial conditions for each of the four simulations , this is essentially the same set of peaks used for analysis in the simulations with h@xmath0  present and varying levels of the radiative background flux .",
    "these peaks span a mass range from @xmath91 to @xmath92 and are modeled in our simulations by @xmath93 to @xmath94 dark matter particles , respectively .",
    "the absence of low mass peaks in the bottom portion of figure [ fig : mvir_z ] is an artifact of our selection criterion .",

    "see , for example , the merger of the two most massive peaks in figure [ fig : mvir_z ] into a single peak between redshifts @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "however since we do not follow all of the low mass clouds in the simulation , we do not construct complete merger trees for the sample .",
    "thus we caution the reader that all the peaks are not statistically independent of each other .",
    "this is particularly noticeable for the high mass peaks which are rare in our simulation volume and may result in a decrease in the scatter of measured properties for the higher mass clouds .",

    "the low flux case is similar in the outer parts of the cloud : the recombination time is long and the h@xmath0  fraction is governed by its equilibrium value .",
    "however , within @xmath89  pc recombination becomes faster than photodissociation .",
    "this reduces the amount of @xmath221 allowed to form and suppresses h@xmath0  formation below the photodissociation equilibrium value .",

    "now that we have detailed examples of the collapse properties of clouds in our simulations , we are better able to assess the importance of neglected processes in our simulations . in this section we discuss in more detail why the neglect of self - shielding and h@xmath20 photodetachment should not significantly change our results .",
    "we then use a simple analytical model , similar to that by tegmark et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , to illustrate the essential physics of the collapse .",
    "we first return to the issue of @xmath225 self - shielding .",
    "although this effect could , in principle , be important for our objects , we argue here that its actual impact is slight .",
    "the maximum column densities of h@xmath0  we encounter in our simulations are around @xmath226 @xmath81 , while a column density of @xmath227 @xmath81 is sufficient to start blocking the soft - uv flux .",
    "so , at first glance , it appears that self - shielding should be important ; however , this value has been derived for a static gas distribution .",
    "the lyman - werner bands consist of a large number of individual lines whose width is dominated ( in our case ) by doppler broadening .",
    "there are substantial velocity gradients within all of our simulated objects , even those which appear to be relaxed .",
    "these take the form not just of radial inflow , but also large - scale disordered velocity fields ( i.e. turbulence ) .",
    "rms _ line - of - sight velocities are around 3 - 4 km / s .",
    "these values are larger than the @xmath2282 km / s line widths due to thermal doppler broadening .",
    "this means that even if a given parcel of gas is behind a large column of molecular hydrogen , it may still be photo - dissociated if it has a velocity shift relative to the blanketing material .",
    "there is very little continuum opacity .",
    "it is a difficult radiative transfer calculation to determine the precise effect of these velocity shifts ; however we may consider two limiting cases .",
    "the first is the previously mentioned static case in which velocities are negligible compared to the thermal doppler widths ( @xmath229 ) and an @xmath225 column density of @xmath227 @xmath81 is sufficient to start affecting the photo - dissociation rate . in the other extreme , in which @xmath230 , the rate is not significantly reduced until a substantial fraction of the 11 - 13 ev range",
    "is blocked by the lyman - werner lines .",
    "since this does not occur until the damping wings of the lines become important , it requires a much larger molecular hydrogen column density , of order @xmath231 @xmath81 ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ; glover & brand 2000 ) . in the simulations",
    ", @xmath232 so we are likely to be closer to the second regime than the first . even if it were marginally important , there are three further reasons to think that self - shielding is unimportant . first , these large column densities occur at late times , once the core has already collapsed . for most of the evolution",
    "the objects are clearly in the optically thin regime .",
    "second , the maximum column density quoted above is to the center of the object , but the cooling front lies outside of the @xmath225 core , and so beyond most of the covering material . finally , once a sufficient amount of @xmath225 has formed to produce a substantial blanketing column , the cooling time has dropped below the photo - dissociation time , so that photo - dissociation is no longer important ( and thus even if the soft - uv flux is attenuated , the subsequent evolution of the gas would be unchanged ) .",
    "so while the results described earlier are properly lower limits to the cooled fraction because of our neglect of self - shielding , a full radiative transfer calculation should produce nearly identical results .",
    "let us also reexamine whether h@xmath20 photo - detachment ( which we neglect ) could significantly affect the results . in order to bracket the size of this effect we consider two spectral shapes for the radiation field , @xmath233 with @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "the softer spectrum , @xmath236 , is the spectral slope expected in this energy range from a typical ob star .",
    "the steeper slope , @xmath237 , is the type of spectral shape one might expect for a background radiation field built up from a number of sources .",

    "furthermore the processes proceed sufficiently rapidly compared to the h@xmath0  chemistry that @xmath251 is well approximated by its equilibrium value ( abel et  al .",
    "1997 ) such that ( including photo - detachment ) : @xmath252 we see that h@xmath20 photo - detachment can be neglected as long as @xmath253 .",

    "thus photo - detachment is unimportant provided that @xmath256 for the steeper @xmath237 spectrum or , a much weaker constraint , that @xmath257 for the softer @xmath247 spectrum .",
    "let us check these constraints against the hydrogen number densities found within the first peak to collapse at our highest flux level ( @xmath156  ergs@xmath35@xmath81hz@xmath35 ) shown in figure [ fig : p0evolve ] . at @xmath178 , before cooling commences , hydrogen number densities in the core region where h@xmath0  will form already exceed @xmath258 .",
    "this number density satisfies the constraint for the steepest spectrum ( @xmath259 ) by more than two orders of magnitude so that the neglect of h@xmath242 photo - detachment does not significantly affect our results .",
    "analytical arguments often provide qualitative insight into the key physical principles at work in a complex process . since we have seen that the h@xmath0  fraction is close to photodissociation equilibrium throughout our objects , we use these equilibrium abundances to develop analytical estimates of the critical h@xmath0  fraction and mass thresholds for collapse .",
    "we adopt the simplified collapse criterion , similar to that of tegmark et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , that an object will collapse if the cooling time @xmath161 , given by equation [ eq : tcool ] , is less than the hubble time @xmath260 , defined in equation [ eq : thub ] .",

    "this allows the derivation of an analytic estimate for the collapse threshold which comes close to matching the full simulation results .",
    "finally , there are a number of other results which deserve further investigation .",
    "one of these is that the collapse redshift does not seem to depend on the angular momentum of the halo ( see section   [ sec : dataset ] ) .",
    "another is that we do not appear to witness fragmentation in these objects .",
    "the few times in which we clearly see more than one collapsed core in a halo appears to be due to the merging of a number of halos , each of which already contained a core .",
    "we also examined a number of process which we omitted from the simulation , including h@xmath0  self - shielding and @xmath221 photo - detachment , none of which appears to be important for this calculation .",
    "these results were derived within the context of a currently popular @xmath1-dominated cosmological model . however , at these high redshifts , the effective @xmath290 should be close to one , so the most important parameter is the amplitude of the power spectrum on these scales .",
    "relatively small changes to the amplitude ( such as would arise from the current uncertainty in @xmath291 ) are unlikely to have a major impact on the results presented here , although it should always be kept in mind that we are extrapolating the power spectrum to scales significantly smaller than constrained by observations .    this work is supported in part by nsf grant ast-9803137 under the auspices of the grand challenge cosmology consortium .",
    "nasa also supported this work through hubble fellowship grant hf-0110401 - 98a from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "the computations used the sgi origin2000 at the national center for supercomputing applications .",
