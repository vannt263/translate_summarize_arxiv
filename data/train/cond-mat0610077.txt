    "many networks do not have a homogeneous topology , but are composed of interacting modules of nodes with a high density of edges within the modules .",
    "for example , in the world wide web , web sites covering similar topics group together into modules @xcite . in social networks , communities naturally form , where people having certain characteristics in common are more likely to be acquainted .",
    "examples include communities of scientists working on similar areas of research @xcite , jazz musicians grouped by race @xcite , departments in an organization @xcite and authors of home pages who have some common interests @xcite .",
    "many non - social networks also have underlying community structure .",
    "for example , biological networks often consist of functional modules @xcite .",
    "these modules can be determined purely from the topology of the network , removing human bias .",
    "knowledge of the modules can then lead to further understanding of a network .",
    "for example , nodes in the same community usually have some properties in common , facilitating classification of nodes .",
    "this can be used to find similar web pages @xcite , aiding search engines and content filtering . in biological networks",
    ", it can be used to find metabolites , proteins or genes performing similar functions , and to understand the role of different elements @xcite .",
    "processes occurring on a network are affected by its modularity , for example communication patterns @xcite or web searching @xcite .",
    "trends spread well within communities @xcite , but diffusion between different communities is slow @xcite .",
    "the amount of time an epidemic lasts on a network has been shown to be a function of the number of modules @xcite . furthermore , although many networks have short paths , including random networks , the short paths can be very difficult to find .",
    "communities in a social network assist in finding short paths @xcite .",
    "modularity can be also used to simplify the amount of data in large complex networks , for example , through coarse - graining @xcite or through characterization of networks by studying the occurrence of motifs @xcite .    for networks with strong community structure ,",
    "a key question is how significant or real is that community structure .",
    "most studies on community structure involve finding the ` best ' partition of nodes into communities @xcite , where best is usually defined in terms of a quantity called the modularity @xcite .",
    "occasionally comparison to random networks with the same degree distribution is made to try to assess the significance of any observed modularity @xcite .",
    "however , by studying just the one best partition , with each node assigned to one community , a lot of useful information is lost .",
    "recently it has become clear that many networks are not simply composed of distinct , weakly interacting modules @xcite .",
    "for example , the modules could be ` fuzzy ' , in the sense that some nodes belong to more than one community , as in social networks where people belong to many overlapping communities @xcite .",
    "the modules could also join together , forming larger modules in a hierarchical manner @xcite .",
    "a further consideration is the robustness or uniqueness of a given partition .",
    "robustness looks for not just the best community structure , but whether it is well defined . in some cases",
    ", there can be many partitions with similarly high modularity , but with a very different partitioning of nodes into communities .",
    "this indicates that the community structure is probably not particularly informative , an extreme example being lattices .",
    "the networks based on lattices are of course very uniform , with identical environments around each lattice point .",
    "however , applying a community detection algorithm to a lattice uncovers partitions with high modularity @xcite .",
    "if just judged in comparison to a randomized graph , it would have been concluded that this community structure is significant .",
    "however , any partition of a lattice is non - unique , since translation of the community boundaries by any lattice vector will generate a new partition with identical modularity .",
    "although the lack of uniqueness in the example of a lattice is transparent , it would be useful to have a general method to test for the lack of robustness in obtained community structures .",
    "in this work , we study equilibrium ensembles of communities at different temperatures .",
    "previous works have begun to look at ensembles of community structures @xcite .",
    "however , the ensembles have usually been generated in an _ ad hoc _ manner , for example by introducing a stochastic element into the algorithms or by comparing the partitions obtained at the end of a number of runs of the algorithm . here",
    ", the ensembles are sampled in a statistically rigorous way , with each partition in the ensemble having a well - defined weight .",
    "the use of temperature is also implicit to some methods for optimizing community structure , with better partitions found at lower temperatures @xcite . here , we rephrase the question of how unique is the obtained community structure as how different are the partitions obtained at a given temperature .",
    "these differences can be visualised using a matrix showing how many times each pair of nodes are classified as being in the same community @xcite .",
    "uniqueness , hierarchical and fuzzy community structures can be seen clearly .    in section [ sec : methods ] , we first introduce the methods used and the properties we measure . then in section [",
    "sec : test ] , we study computer - generated test networks with prescribed community structure , introduced by girvan and newman and often used to test algorithms @xcite . to illustrate the issue of uniqueness of community structure ,",
    "a hexagonal lattice is studied in section [ sec : lat ] .",
    "we then apply our approach to scale - free networks in order to determine the effect of the degree distribution . the apollonian network ( section [ sec : apollo ] )",
    "is an example of a spatial , scale - free network @xcite .",
    "it has some community structure @xcite , grouping together nodes that are close in space as for the hexagonal lattice , but with different length scales potentially leading to a hierarchical structure . in section [ sec : sf ] , we study scale - free test networks with introduced community structure similar to the original test networks , the difference being that the original test networks have an erds - renyi degree distribution .",

    "e.  coli _ @xcite .",
    "community structure has been uncovered in this network previously @xcite .",
    "however , biological networks often have complex , hierarchical community structure rather than isolated modules @xcite . as such",
    ", our approach is particularly appropriate .",
    "to find good partitions the modularity is often used @xcite , and is defined by @xmath1 this quantity gives a measure of how many more edges are within communities compared to that expected for a random network .",
    "@xmath2 is the total number of edges in the network , and @xmath3 is the degree of node @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 measures the number of edges lying within community @xmath6 , i.e.  the nodes at either end of these edges are both classified as belonging to community @xmath6 for this partition .",
    "@xmath7 is the fraction of all ends of edges that arrive at community @xmath6 .",
    "if an edge is chosen and followed at random , it gives the probability that the node at the end belongs to community @xmath6 .",
    "hence , @xmath8 gives the predicted fraction of edges within community @xmath6 .    to characterize the possible partitioning of the network into communities ,",
    "we generate a canonical ensemble of network partitions , with @xmath9 playing the role of energy .",
    "i.e.  at temperature @xmath10 , the statistical weight of a given partition in the ensemble is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "each partition is described by a vector assigning each node to a community , similar to the coordinate vector describing a configuration .",
    "the ensemble is simulated using metropolis monte carlo .",
    "each move involves changing the community assigned to a node . if the move leads to a better community structure , i.e.  an increase in @xmath0 , the move is accepted , otherwise it is accepted with a temperature - dependent probability @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the difference in @xmath0 between the new and old partitions .    for a network with @xmath14 nodes and @xmath15 communities ,",
    "a node is chosen with probability @xmath16 and assigned to either one of the existing communities or to a new community , each with probability @xmath17 . because the aim is to generate equilibrium ensembles of partitions ,",
    "detailed balance must be maintained , i.e.  the probability of attempting a move ( not necessarily accepting it ) must be equal to the probability of attempting the reverse move . if the selected node is in a community of size one , i.e.  by itself , a move will either leave the structure unchanged , or decrease the number of communities . therefore , a community must be chosen with probability @xmath18 , excluding the option of starting a new community , which in this case is equivalent to choosing the community to which the node already belongs .    to facilitate the generation of equilibrium ensembles even at low temperature , we use parallel tempering @xcite . in this method ,",
    "monte carlo simulations are simultaneously run at a set of different temperatures , but where additional exchange moves are attempted that involve swapping the partitions between two temperatures .",
    "such moves are always accepted if the higher temperature had a higher @xmath0 value , otherwise it is accepted with probability @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is now the difference in @xmath0 between the partitions at the two temperatures and @xmath21 is the difference in the inverse temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the initial state of each ensemble has each node in a separate community .",
    "a number of steps are then required to equilibrate the system . at the lowest temperature",
    ", @xmath0 tends to a single , maximum value , @xmath23 .",
    "we call the corresponding partition the global maximum .",
    "although without testing all of the possible partitions it is impossible to be certain there is not a partition with higher @xmath0 @xcite , the use of the parallel tempering method makes it likely that the true global maximum has been found for the network sizes used here .",
    "various properties can be calculated for these ensembles .",
    "we study the variation of @xmath0 with temperature , seeing an increase towards an optimal value at low temperatures . the heat capacity ,",
    "@xmath24 is used to characterize the nature of these changes with a peak in the heat capacity representing a transition .",
    "the more rapidly that @xmath0 changes , the sharper the peak will be .",
    "we define the transition temperature , @xmath25 , as the temperature at which this peak occurs .",
    "we also introduce an order parameter to measure the similarity of the sampled partitions at a given temperature , reflecting the uniqueness of the underlying community structure .",
    "we look at frequency matrices , measuring the relative number of times each pair of nodes is classified as belonging to the same community .",
    "if only one community structure is observed , as is generally the case at sufficiently low temperatures , the same pairs of nodes are assigned to the same community in each partition , giving a block diagonal matrix . at infinite temperatures ,",
    "each partition has equivalent weight and any pair of nodes is equally likely to be together , giving a homogeneous matrix . at intermediate temperatures",
    ", there may be some remnants of community structure , with some pairs of nodes being assigned to the same community relatively often , showing as darker areas in the frequency matrix .",
    "this uniqueness can be quantified using the fiedler eigenvalue @xmath26 , @xcite i.e.  the magnitude of the second smallest eigenvalue ( the smallest being zero ) of the laplacian . the elements of the laplacian matrix are the negative of the elements of the frequency matrix , except for the diagonals , which are sums over the corresponding row . for comparisons between different temperatures , the frequency matrix is first rescaled by the sum of all the elements , which is larger when there are fewer , larger communities at lower temperatures .",
    "@xmath26 gives a measure of how ` diagonal ' the matrix is , and takes values of zero for a block diagonal matrix and one for a homogeneous matrix .",
    "it therefore gives a measure of how different the partitions at each temperature are and can be used as an order parameter , since it is close to one at high temperatures and decreases at low temperatures .",
    "if the best community structure , seen at low temperatures , is degenerate , i.e.  there are competing partitions with equal values of @xmath0 , then @xmath26 will remain above zero as the temperature decreases to zero .",
    "even if @xmath26 does go to zero , it provides insight into the character of the transition .",
    "a sharp transition indicates that there are few competing structures with high @xmath0 , whereas a broader transition implies the opposite .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the fiedler eigenvalue gives the best order in which to place the nodes to make the frequency matrix look maximally ` blocky ' , and assists with assigning the nodes to communities .",
    "interestingly , the fiedler eigenvalue is also used in spectral partitioning to find communities @xcite , the difference being that spectral partitioning sorts the adjacency matrix into its most blocky form , whereas here we apply it to the frequency matrix .",
    "it has also been recently used to find communities by maximising @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the test networks used consist of 128 nodes , each designated as belonging to one of four communities of 32 nodes each @xcite .",
    "1024 edges are added . of these",
    ", @xmath27 connect nodes belonging to the same community and the remaining @xmath28 connect nodes in different communities .",
    "@xmath29 is varied between 0.25 and 1 .",
    "when @xmath30 , nodes are only connected to other nodes in the same community , giving four components corresponding to the four communities . when @xmath31 , one quarter of the edges leading from a node are expected to be connected to nodes in the same community .",
    "based on the sizes of the communities , this is exactly as would be expected if the nodes were connected at random .",
    "therefore , when @xmath31 the network is essentially random , i.e.  an erds - renyi graph .",
    "@xmath32 is an interesting case in that a node is as likely to be connected to nodes in its own community as it is to nodes in other communities . indeed",
    ", we do see some differences between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "assuming that all nodes have the average degree , it can then be shown that the modularity for the input community structure would be given by @xmath35 .",

    "however , for @xmath33 , we find a global maximum ( gm ) that is better ( has higher @xmath0 ) than the input community structure .",

    "this is because the community structure in these test networks is very homogeneous : all nodes have roughly the same degree , and the input communities all have the same size and strength .    by contrast , for @xmath33 , the gms consist of different sized communities , and because of these heterogeneities the transition is much broader , with some communities breaking up before others . as the gm , @xmath23 and",

    "the apollonian network has a very similar @xmath23 to the test network with @xmath48 . aside from the hierarchical aspects to the frequency matrices for the apollonian packing , the properties of the two networks are extremely similar , showing that the degree distribution is the dominant determinant of the behavior .",
    "even for @xmath29 close to one a bimodal distribution of @xmath0 values is not seen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfnij ] ) , unlike the corresponding test network in section [ sec : test ] .",
    "the distributions are much broader around @xmath25 when stronger community structure is present .",
    "@xmath0 is sensitive to small changes in temperature , leading to a sharp transition , but rather than switching between two distinct phases , this change is continuous .    ,",

    "we now apply this approach to a metabolic network describing pathways between metabolites that has been found to have a scale - free topology @xcite . in this network , nodes represent metabolites and edges connect those that are interconverted by a chemical reaction in _ e.  coli_. each chemical reaction can be classified as belonging to a particular metabolic pathway that performs a certain function , e.g.  carbohydrate metabolism .",
    "we first reduced the size of the network from 896 to 304 nodes , by recursively removing all @xmath49 nodes by assuming that they belong to the same community as the one node to which they are connected .",
    "the metabolic network has a very high @xmath23 , as noted previously @xcite , indicating that it is a highly modular network , where the different modules are responsible for different functions .",
    "similar to the other scale - free networks , the transition is fairly broad ( fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] ) .",
    "the breadth reflects the broader degree distribution , competing length scales , and heterogeneities in the community structure . at intermediate temperatures ,",
    "it is clear that some of the smaller communities break up and merge with other communities , while others remain intact ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fmat - met ] ) .",
    "the communities that break up only integrate with a limited number of other nodes , leading to the weak blockiness exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmat - met ] . in the networks",
    "studied so far , the communities have all been fairly similar , whereas in this example some communities are stronger than others , and as such more difficult to break up , thus contributing to the broadness of the transition .    even though some hierarchy can be seen in the frequency matrix , @xmath26 smoothly tends towards zero at low temperatures , meaning one partition dominates .",
    "this result implies that the uncovered community structure is unique and therefore significant .",
    "although a few of the low temperature communities involve metabolites associated with different pathways , most communities tend to correspond to a single pathway , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmat - met ] , the stronger communities are subgroups of those corresponding to nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism , and to a lesser extent amino acid metabolism .    , heat capacity @xmath41 , and @xmath26 with temperature for the metabolic network .",
    ", width=325 ]",
    "to assess the significance and nature of the community structure obtained by algorithms that optimize the modularity , we have studied how canonical ensembles of network partitions depend on temperature , where @xmath9 plays the role of energy .",
    "typically , there is a transition from low entropy , high @xmath0 partitions to high entropy , low @xmath0 essentially random partitions as the temperature is increased .",
    "the heat capacity provides a useful probe of this transition .",
    "if there is strong community structure , the transition is sharp .",
    "the peak is broader for networks with weaker community structure , as there are more reasonable alternative partitions with intermediate values of @xmath0 , and so the transition occurs over a broader range of temperature . if a network has a scale - free or broader degree distribution , the transition also tends to be broader , because the network is more heterogeneous and hubs are likely to make it difficult to separate a network into different modules .",
    "we have introduced an order parameter @xmath26 to quantify the uniqueness of the community structure , i.e.  whether there is just a single partition with high @xmath0 or a number of competing partitions .",
    "@xmath26 is therefore useful as a tool to detect false positives , i.e.  partitions whose have high values of @xmath0 do not reflect significant community structure . in the case of a lattice ,",
    "the partition with the highest @xmath0 value is highly degenerate and therefore not significant .",
    "consistent with this , @xmath26 at @xmath43 is non - zero . for the random networks ,",
    "@xmath26 is zero at the lowest temperatures because the gm is non - degenerate .",
    "however , below @xmath25 @xmath26 takes significant values ( around 0.20.3 ) , reflecting the many competing partitions that detract from the significance of the gm .",
    "frequency matrices , in particular their temperature dependence , provide the most information .",
    "for example , it is possible to determine whether the topology is based around a single community structure with small fluctuations , implying that the network is composed of weakly interacting modules , as in the test networks with high @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , more complex modularity features can also be visualised .",
    "for example , in the apollonian packing , the hierarchical nature is clear form the chequerboard pattern along the diagonal , and nodes with associations to more than one community are revealed , reflecting overlapping community structures .",
    "the temperature evolution of the frequency matrix for the metabolic network is particularly interesting , as heterogeneities in the community structure are apparent , with the stronger communities persisting to higher temperature .    in summary , the results in this paper highlight the importance of studying more than simply the ` best ' partition into communities , and the methods introduced in this paper",
    "provide a rigorous approach for doing so ."
