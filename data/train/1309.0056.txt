    "the study of abelian gauge theory on @xmath6 led string theorists to discover an interesting symmetry , the electric - magnetic duality , which inverts the coupling constant and extends to an action of @xmath7 .",

    "this modular invariance can be tested by studying the partition function of the theory , roughly speaking , measuring the euler characteristic of the instanton moduli space of that theory .",
    "one of interesting results by string theorists in @xcite was to show that the topological quantum field theories obtained by the so - called ( topologically ) twisted super yang - mills theories over the four manifold and their associated partition functions are equivalent to donaldson s theory of four manifolds and the associated partition function of donaldson s invariants .",

    "recently the study of the conjectural modular properties of the bps partition functions of the supersymmetric d4-d2-d0 black holes @xcite , @xcite motivated algebraic geometers to construct a mathematical framework for modeling the d4-d2-d0 bps states and prove the modularity properties of their associated partition functions , using purely algebraic - geometric techniques .",
    "the current article is the third in the sequel , after @xcite and @xcite , of the authors attempt to achieve this goal where here , the focus of the study is to specifically compute the d4-d2-d0 bps invariants via computing their mathematical counterpart given by the donaldson - thomas invariants of torsion sheaves in an ambient calabi - yau threefold .",
