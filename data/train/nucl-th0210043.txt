    "over the past fifteen years charmonium suppression has been considered as one of the best signatures of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation .",
    "recently this belief was questioned by some works .",
    "@xmath0 suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions is based on the following simple argument , presented in the original work by matsui and satz @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations show that the heavy quark - antiquark potential becomes screened at high enough temperatures . as a consequence ,",
    "when the range of the potential becomes smaller than the @xmath0 bohr radius the bound state can no longer be formed . on the other hand , detailed simulations @xcite of a population of @xmath2 pairs traversing",
    "the plasma suggested that , given the large number of such pairs , the recombination effect of the pairs into charmonium coulomb bound states is non - negligible and might even lead to an enhancement of @xmath0 production .",
    "this conclusion received support from the calculations of @xcite , where a two component model for @xmath0 production was proposed .",
    "taking the existing calculations seriously , it is no longer clear that an overall suppression of the number of @xmath0 s will be a signature of qgp .",
    "a more detailed analysis is required and a more complex pattern can emerge . in particular , we might have suppression in some regions of the phase space and enhancement in others . indeed , this is the result of the analysis presented in @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors study the fate of @xmath2 pairs produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions , comparing the case where they have to traverse qgp with the case where they have to traverse ordinary nuclear matter .",
    "one of the merits of that paper is to emphasize that very interesting information can be extracted from the scaled momentum ( @xmath3 ) distribution of the produced @xmath0 s .    motivated by these observations ,",
    "in this work we address the @xmath0 feynman momentum distributions . in some aspects we follow refs . @xcite and @xcite with one important difference : we include @xmath0 production _ within the plasma_. this",
    "is usually neglected because the number of @xmath4 pairs produced in the plasma is believed to be small . however , as it will be discussed in section iii , a closer look into the existing estimates shows discrepancies of two orders of magnitude . in @xcite , for example , it was estimated to be of the order of @xmath5 of the total number of charm quark pairs . in @xcite , with the inclusion of thermal parton masses",
    "this fraction was estimated to reach @xmath6 . finally , in @xcite this number could , in some cases , be equal to the number of directly produced pairs .",
    "no systematic effort was made to reconcile these different estimates mainly because the screening mechanism was believed to destroy all bound states .",
    "therefore in - plasma charm production has been an issue of open charm physics whereas the main focus has always been on hidden charm production and suppression .    although well established in several lattice calculations",
    "@xcite , the color screening mechanism may be not so effective in real collisions .",
    "the existing lattice results are valid for an infinite mass , static , charge - anticharge pair and we know that this is not very close to the real situation , where charges are not so heavy and are moving .",
    "recently , a calculation of the screening effect in moving charges @xcite showed that , in this case the screening is not so strong . with the improvements of lattice gauge determinations @xcite of the temperature - dependent quark - antiquark potential new calculations of the quarkonium spectrum in qgp were performed . in @xcite",
    "it was found that at up to temperatures of the order of @xmath7 the @xmath0 can survive as a bound state in the plasma . at higher temperatures the potential is too shallow to hold a bound charmonium state .",
    "we shall assume that screening is not so strong and , in a narrow temperature window just above the phase transition , will allow for charmonium ( coulomb ) bound states which `` survive '' from qgp .",
    "more precisely , we will allow up to one in hundred bound states to survive in the region where they should be screened and destroyed .",
    "as it will be seen , these `` survivors '' tend to escape with @xmath8 , thus giving us a new kind of qgp signal .",
    "moreover , this peak at low @xmath3 will fill the dip predicted in @xcite .",
    "we will consider @xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions by three different mechanisms : i ) direct ( primordial qcd parton fusion ) ii ) thermal ( statistical coalescence at hadronization ) and iii ) qgp ( in - plasma parton fusion ) .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite i ) and ii ) are just two extreme cases . in realistic simulations , for a fixed number of @xmath4 pairs and of @xmath0 s , these last are gradually destroyed , giving origin to the `` regenerated '' component ii ) . in the particular calculation presented in @xcite , for central collisions and for high enough energies a near to complete replacement of the initial by the final thermal @xmath0 s was found .",
    "component iii ) was considered long time ago @xcite , before the work of matsui and satz , and then it was left in oblivion . once produced the charmonium state will suffer interactions with the partons in the plasma , or with hadrons in hot and dense medium and in a later stage with comoving hadrons @xcite .    before performing detailed calculations",
    "one could try to guess the shape of the outcoming @xmath0 s @xmath3 distribution in the three mechanisms mentioned above .",
    "qcd production has been studied in the past and the naive extrapolation of the spectra measured in @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions would lead us to conclude that the @xmath0 s produced in i ) should follow a distribution of the type @xcite :    ( 1-x_f)^c [ qcd1 ]    where @xmath11 . as it will be discussed in the next section , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations within",
    "the framework of the color evaporation model ( cem ) confirmed this behavior in leading order and next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "no explicit calculation of this @xmath3 distribution was performed with the color octet model ( com ) , but a recent study of asymmetries in open charm production @xcite suggests that a similar smooth behavior at @xmath8 might be found for the @xmath0 differential cross section .",
    "of course , this has to be verified .",
    "thermal production follows a bose - einstein distribution @xcite , which integrated in @xmath12 gives :    exp [ bose ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath13 are the feynman momentum and the c.m.s . nucleon - nucleon invariant energy . comparing ( [ qcd1 ] ) with ( [ bose ] ) , we can see that the latter flattens out at low values of @xmath3 , because of the mass @xmath14 , forming a `` plateau '' . a spectrum from mechanism iii ) is a little more difficult to predict .",
    "it involves the convolution of two distributions of the type ( [ bose ] ) ( for the two colliding massless partons ) and therefore we expect it to be more steeply falling with @xmath3 .",
    "as it will be seen , within certain approximations , it is given by :    [ qgp1 ]    this behavior was found with the cem . it remains to be shown that it is not an artifact of the model and that it would also be found in the thermal version of the com .",
    "comparing ( [ qcd1 ] ) , ( [ bose ] ) and ( [ qgp1 ] ) we see that , if qgp is formed _ and _ if the multiplicity of `` in - plasma - formed '' @xmath0 s is large enough , we may expect to see an enhancement ( or even a peak ) at the origin of the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "this signal is interesting because it was not predicted by any other production mechanism .",
    "however it relies on a very accurate knowledge of the pqcd , thermal and qgp abundancies , which is very difficult , as it will be dicussed in detail later .    at this point",
    "one might argue that after being produced by the usual pqcd mechanism , the @xmath2 bound state suffers interactions either with the plasma or with comovers in a hadron gas .",
    "these interactions ( called here final state interactions ) will distort the initial @xmath3 distribution of the bound state . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that fsi ( either with a plasma or a hadron gas ) will suppress the charmonium yield at @xmath1 , giving origin to a dip in the central @xmath3 region .",
    "we are suggesting that a peak will arise at @xmath1 as a consequence of in - plasma production .",
    "this is a signal which will emerge from the background composed by initial pqcd production . if we ignore the final state interactions we will calculate a background which already contains an enhancement of @xmath0 production in the low @xmath3 region , making it harder to detect the signal . in other words , if we treat correctly the fsi this will lead to a background with a dip around @xmath1 instead of an enhancement",
    "therefore , at least for the sake of our argument , neglecting fsi is being conservative .",
    "this is the correct procedure in order to isolate the new effect , which we are looking for .",
    "nevertheless , at the end of this work we will include fsi quantitatively and investigate their effect on the @xmath0 momentum distribution .",
    "the text is organized in the following way : in section ii we describe direct production ; in sections iii and iv we address production in the plasma and final thermal production respectively ; in section v we discuss final state interactions ; in section vi we present numerical results and in the last section we make some concluding remarks .",
    "nowadays perturbative qcd calculations of @xmath2 production can be found in textbooks .",
    "nevertheless , we shall , in what follows , give some formulas to introduce the notation , to stress the role played by shadowing and to obtain expressions in terms of @xmath3 , the variable of interest .",
    "one popular approach to charm production is the color evaporation model @xcite .",
    "we are aware of the discrepancies between different implementations of perturbative qcd in charm production @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is another model , namely the color octet model @xcite , which gives a more sophisticated description of the hadronization process in terms of non - perturbative matrix elements .",
    "while the com seems to give a very good description of high @xmath15 data ( @xmath16 gev ) , especially those from the fermilab tevatron , it is not so reliable at smaller @xmath15 @xcite ( @xmath17 gev ) , where the bulk of charmonium production takes place and where we wish to make a comparison between qcd and plasma production . for our purpose of studying the @xmath3 distributions , as can be inferred from the calculations presented in @xcite , the com prediction is compatible with a smooth behavior of the cross section @xmath18 at the origin @xmath8 , much like the cem .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we shall use this latter model in what follows .",
    "our results will certainly depend on the choice of approach .",
    "inspite of the uncertainties , we will assume that , since we are interested in the low @xmath3 region , pqcd is enough and nonperturbative effects are small , in sharp contrast to what happens at large @xmath3 @xcite .    in the cem",
    ", charmonium is defined kinematically as a @xmath2 state with mass below the @xmath19 threshold . in leading order ( lo )",
    "the cross section is computed with the use of perturbative qcd for the diagrams of the elementary processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 convoluted with the parton densities in the projectile and in the target .",
    "calling @xmath3 the fractional momentum of the produced pair ( with respect to the momentum of a projectile nucleon in cm frame ) and @xmath13 the cm energy of a nucleon - nucleon collision , the cross section for production of a @xmath2 pair with mass @xmath22 is just given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the nucleon momentum fractions carried respectively by partons in the projetile and target . the function @xmath26 , which represents the convolution of the elementary cross sections and parton densities is given by : @xmath27 \\ , \\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}}(m^2 )   \\label{cem2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the parton densities @xmath28 in the nucleon computed at the scale @xmath29 .",
    "the lo elementary cross sections in terms of the pair invariant mass ( @xmath22 ) are given by @xcite : @xmath30-\\frac{1}{4 }   \\left(7+\\frac{31m_c^2}{m^2}\\right ) \\lambda \\right\\ } \\label{siggg}\\ ] ] @xmath31^{1/2 } \\label{sigqq}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the mass of the @xmath33 quark .",
    "the production cross section of the charmed state @xmath34 ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) @xmath37 , is then finally obtained by integrating the free pair cross section @xmath2 over the invariant mass @xmath22 starting from the production threshold @xmath38 up to open charm production threshold @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fraction of @xmath42 which contains the corresponding @xmath2 resonance .",
    "this model describes well the experimentally measured @xmath3 distribution of hidden charm both with lo and nlo cross sections , provided that @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 multiplied by a theoretical factor @xmath45 , which is equal to the ratio of the nlo and lo cross sections ( @xmath46 ) @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we shall use the cem to study perturbative @xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic .",
    "as it is well known , in nuclear collisions and in processes involving small values of @xmath47 , shadowing plays an important role ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this case expression ( [ cem2 ] ) is rewritten as : @xmath48 \\ ,   \\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}}(m^2)\\biggr\\ } \\label{cem4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where r_i^a(x , m^2)= [ ra ] with @xmath49 being the @xmath34 parton momentum distribution in a nucleon inside the nucleus @xmath50 .",
    "replacing @xmath51 by @xmath52 in ( [ cem1 ] ) we obtain the cross section for @xmath2 production in @xmath53 collisions : @xmath54 and the @xmath0 production cross section as : @xmath55    in a central @xmath56 collision the number of @xmath0 s produced directly is related to the cross section by @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the radius of nucleus @xmath50 .",
    "the expression above would give the final distribution if there were no absorption due to further interactions with partons in a qgp or hadrons in a comoving fireball .",
    "the effect of these final state interactions will be discussed later .",
    "since we are going to compare the total number of initially produced @xmath59 pairs and @xmath0 s with those produced in the plasma it is useful to introduce the compact notation @xmath60 for the number of @xmath59 pairs and @xmath61 for the number of @xmath0 s .",
    "expressions ( [ ccbarqcd ] ) and ( [ psiqcd ] ) are calculated with the nuclear parton distributions which take shadowing into account .",
    "while this makes calculations more realistic , it also introduces some model dependence in the results . in order to have a baseline for comparisons",
    "it is useful to introduce the equivalent definitions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 without shadowing . for central @xmath64 collisions",
    "these are : @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the usual nuclear overlap function . in table",
    "i we present some quantitative results for ( [ ccbarqcd ] ) , ( [ psiqcd ] ) , ( [ ccbarnoshad ] ) and ( [ psinoshad ] ) .",
    "as it can be seen , these numbers change with different choices for the charm quark mass and for the parton distribution .",
    "inclusion of shadowing reduces the number of charm quark pairs and @xmath0 s in about 10 % , choosing different parton densities may change these numbers in 40 % but what changes the most our results is the adopted value for the charm quark mass .",
    "this choice may alter the numbers by a factor 4 .",
    "our number of @xmath68 pairs is smaller but still compatible with other estimates presented , for example , in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the number of @xmath0 s can be estimated taking into account the recent phenix data @xcite on @xmath69 collisions .",
    "these estimates @xcite indicate that @xmath70 , which is close to the number of @xmath0 s in table i.",
    "as in the previous section we reproduce below ( to a great extent ) textbook material @xcite , with the purpose of defining our notation . the derivation presented here is also useful because , relaxing the screening hypothesis , we calculate the production of charm _ bound states _ in the plasma and we integrate the rate on all variables except @xmath3 .",
    "all this requires some straightforward but not very often shown manipulations .",
    "the computation of the in - plasma @xmath2 pair production rate goes back to the late eighties @xcite , was discussed in short papers ( for example @xcite ) , included in comprehensive review articles @xcite during the nineties and experienced improvements due to advances in thermal field theory @xcite .",
    "assuming that qgp is formed , we then have a gas of quarks and gluons with momenta obeying respectively fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions that can collide producing @xmath2 pairs .",
    "this is the same mechanism , which in the strange sector causes the strangeness enhancement . in the charm case",
    ", there will be always a `` charm enhancement '' but , because of screening , the charmed quarks will mostly form open charm . in the present calculation we will let part of the thermally produced charm coulomb bound states escape . since the temperature is high , there will be a significant number of parton - parton collisions at a cms energy high enough to produce charm quark pairs , which may form charmonium states .",
    "we will now estimate their production rate using the cem in a thermal environment .",
    "the charmonium production rate in the reaction @xmath71 , at temperature @xmath72 is given by @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gluon statistical factor ( number of colors @xmath75 number polarization states ) @xmath76 is the relative velocity between colliding gluons with energies @xmath77 and @xmath78 and three momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the elementary gluon - gluon cross section ( [ siggg ] ) and @xmath82 the usual thermal distribution function : @xmath83    we now introduce the charm pair four momentum @xmath84 with help of the delta function @xmath85 $ ] : @xmath86 \\label{dnd4pgg}\\ ] ]    in the expression above we have : @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the pair .",

    "we will also , for completeness , consider the case where the @xmath0 s produced in the early stage of the collision traverse the plasma being destroyed and then `` regenerated '' @xcite .",
    "we call them `` thermal '' .",
    "as has been discussed in the literature @xcite , regenerated @xmath0 s follow a thermal distribution with the temperature of the quark - hadron phase transition @xmath166 mev : & = & _ 0^s d p_t^2 exp + & = & const exp [ dnthermal ] where the constant in front of the integral will be fixed later through the normalization condition : @xmath167",
    "in sections ii , iii and iv we discussed @xmath0 production .",
    "after being produced these states will suffer interaction with the free partons of the plasma and later with the hadronic comovers . in @xcite ,",
    "the final state interactions ( fsi ) were incorporated ( to the rate analogous to our ( [ npsiqcd ] ) ) by the introduction of the multiplicative suppression factors @xmath168 and @xmath169 , for interactions with comovers and qgp partons respectively .",

    "in fact , in the case of the initial qcd production , since we are using the same formalism , for the sake of comparison we shall later borrow the final corrected expression from @xcite . in the case of ( [ psiqgp ] ) , the @xmath0 dissociation by partons within the plasma",
    "is already taken into account by the `` screening factor '' @xmath159 .",

    "since @xmath171 is a function of the rapidity , it will depend also on @xmath3 .",
    "however , restricting the analysis to central collisions and to a fixed ( @xmath13 ) energy , the suppression factor tends to be constant , as concluded in @xcite . for simplicity we shall take here the average of the values quoted in these works : @xmath175 final state interactions with comovers will be included in the thermal production differential rate ( [ dnthermal ] ) in the same way and with the use of ( [ smean ] ) .",

    "even if suppressed , it will leave a signal .",
    "moreover , this may happen at rhic and at sps as well .    in order to further investigate the differences between the three @xmath0 production mechanisms we will study the relation between the measured number of @xmath0 s and the naive expectation based on what we know from @xmath191 collisions .",
    "experimentally this ratio is easily constructed from the measured @xmath3 spectra in @xmath192 and @xmath193 collsions .",

    "@xmath200 shows essentially the effect of shadowing in the low @xmath47 region .",
    "we can see that if no effect is present , other than shadowing , @xmath0 spectrum produced in @xmath201 collisions is just a constant times the corresponding @xmath191 spectrum .",
    "as it can be seen this constant may change a lot with the pdf .",
    "this constancy in the region @xmath202 will be important for the subsequent discussion .",
    "this figure shows also that the value of the constant decreases when we go from sps to rhic collisions .",
    "this same behavior was found in @xcite .    in figure 3",
    "we present the @xmath3 distribution of the in - plasma produced @xmath0 s .",
    "the screening factor will be fixed to @xmath165 .",
    "the curves are obtained with expression ( [ npsiqgp ] ) normalized to the largest ( solid line ) and to the smallest ( dashed line ) number of @xmath0 s .",
    "these normalization constants correspond to the choices 2.7 and 0.16 , in the last line of table ii .",
    "fig . 3a and 3b correspond to rhic and sps collisions respectively .",
    "if we believe that all production is mainly direct plus some small plasma component , then ( [ r1 ] ) aquires the form : @xmath203 where , for the moment , we neglect the final state interactions discussed in the previous section . if the screening in the plasma is so strong that @xmath162 , then , @xmath204 . if , however , there is a small @xmath0 survival probability , for example @xmath165 , there will be a noticeable change in @xmath205 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , where we see a pronounced deviation from a flat behavior in the low @xmath3 region if there is a contribution from the plasma .",
    "this interesting feature is due to nature of plasma production , which is peaked at @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "4 the two upper lines correspond to the largest plasma @xmath0 production ( @xmath206 ) and the lower two lines to the smallest plasma contribution ( @xmath207 ) .",

    "2 .    figs .",
    "4a and 4b refer to @xmath183 at rhic and to @xmath208 at sps respectively .",
    "we can clearly see that deviations from unity happen more strongly for rhic collisions .",
    "the above situation has to be regarded as an extreme case , in which @xmath0 s are produced via parton fusion ( with shadowing taken into account ) in the initial state of the nucleus - nucleus collision and then just escape from the fireball , without further nuclear or comover suppression .",
    "we now consider the opposite extreme case , where all @xmath0 s are formed in the final state .",
    "final state here means that the original @xmath0 s are totally destroyed by plasma screening and recriated at the final stage of the fireball life ( at @xmath209 mev ) by coalescence and then just `` emerge ready '' during the fase transition , obeying the thermal distribution ( [ dnthermal ] ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the calculations performed in @xcite . assuming this production mechanism the ratio defined above is modified to : @xmath210 where @xmath211 . when discussing thermal production a crucial aspect is how to normalize the distribution ( [ dnthermal ] ) .",
    "the most straightforward procedure would be to normalize it in such a way that the total number of @xmath33 and @xmath212 quarks in the final state would match the number of charm quarks pairs produced initially and computed with the help of perturbative qcd .",
    "however , as we can see from table i and also from the recent and comprehensive analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , already at the @xmath213 level there is some uncertainty in the cross section coming from choices of the quark masses , renormalization scales and parton density parametrizations . a further source of uncertainty arises when we go from @xmath214 to @xmath201 collisions and introduce shadowing effects .",
    "moreover , in a very recent calculation of thermal charm production @xcite , already taking into account the first phenix data @xcite , it was shown that , to explain the overall magnitude of the data , one needs to increase the nlo qcd @xmath128 yield by a factor @xmath215 . in view of this lack of precise knowledge , in our study we will normalize the integral of eq .",
    "( [ dnthermal ] ) , @xmath216 in two different ways : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is given by eq .",
    "( [ psiqcd ] ) , which , in turn , will be evaluated with two different nuclear parton distributions    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the ratio @xmath219 .",
    "the two lower ( upper ) pannels refer to @xmath186 ( @xmath220 ) data measured at sps ( rhic ) . in",
    "the two left ( right ) pannels we use the eskola _",
    "@xcite ( hirai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) nuclear parton distributions . inside each of the pannels ,",
    "the two upper curves are obtained with i ) @xmath221 and the two lower curves with ii ) @xmath222 .",
    "finally , solid and dashed lines represent the maximal and the minimal contribution from the qgp component eq .",
    "( [ npsiqgp ] ) .",
    "although @xmath165 it is easy to see that choosing a smaller value for the screening factor would move the solid lines to the dashed ones , since they contain already a very small number of `` in - plasma '' born @xmath0 s .    in fig",
    "5 we see that there is already a rise of @xmath219 at decreasing values of @xmath3 , but this rise has the shape of a plateau ( as anticipated in the introduction ) , starting from @xmath223 . if the screening is less effective , @xmath165 , then we find a deviation from the plateau at rhic energies , as in figs . 5a and 5b , but do not observe any visible effect at sps energies , as in figs . 5c and 5d . from these last figures",
    "we conclude that in - plasma production can hardly be detected at sps since the @xmath3 distribution is always dominated by the thermal ( plateau - like ) contribution . on the other hand",
    ", it should be remarked that if a plateau is found experimentally , this is interesting in itself , being a strong evidence in favor of the statistical hadronization model , which implies plasma formation .",
    "now we come back to the prediction made in @xcite , namely that the initially produced @xmath0 s after the interaction either with hadronic comovers or with the plasma will disappear around @xmath8 giving place to a dip in this region .",
    "we can split eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) into two pieces , the first one containing initial production and the second containing the plasma contribution . in order to include the suppression resulting from the final state interactions predicted in @xcite , we replace the first piece by a parametrization of @xmath224 , eq .",

    "solid and dashed lines correspond to the nuclear parton densities of refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "6a and 6b correspond to rhic and sps collisions respectively .",
    "following the same convention employed in fig .",
    "4 , in each pannel the two upper curves represent the largest qgp contribution , whereas the two lower curves represent the smallest qgp contribution . comparing figs . 4 and 6",
    "we can see that the inclusion of fsi changes the results , decreasing the strength of the low @xmath3 enhancement .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of in - plasma production remains quite visible .",
    "notice that the lowest line crosses the origin of the horizontal axis ( @xmath8 ) at @xmath226 .",
    "this is still far above the point predicted in @xcite , of @xmath227 .",
    "we discuss now two more conservative scenarios , i.e. , with less qgp production .",
    "first , we consider the lower part of fig .",
    "6a , amplifying the scale and allowing for smaller values of the screening factor @xmath159 ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "this amplification is shown in fig .",
    "inspite of the uncertainties in the calculations , our results in this figure , being still larger than the one found in @xcite ( the dash - dotted line ) , suggest that an enhancement in @xmath229 in the low @xmath3 region might be seen if qgp would be formed . finally , we compute again the qgp production rate , using the same inputs except for the initial temperature of the plasma , which we take to be @xmath185 mev . at these smaller temperatures",
    "the screening factor must be larger and we choose it to be @xmath230 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "7b ) with the same conventions used in the previous figures . as it can be seen , our lowest line is still above the result of @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered @xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions by three different mechanisms : direct ( primordial parton fusion ) ii ) thermal ( statistical coalescence at hadronization ) and iii ) qgp ( in - plasma parton fusion ) .",
    "as already discussed in @xcite i ) and ii ) are just two extreme cases . in realistic simulations , for a fixed number of @xmath4 pairs and of @xmath0 s , these last are gradually destroyed , giving origin to the `` regenerated '' component ii ) .",
    "component iii ) is reconsidered here after being forgotten for long time .",
    "our main point was that , even being small , contribution iii ) is very strongly peaked around @xmath8 and can thus become visible if enough plasma is formed .    with this in mind we defined the ratio ( [ r1 ] ) and computed it assuming mechanism i ) plus a small component of iii ) ( ratio @xmath205 ) and assuming mechanism ii ) plus a small component of iii ) ( ratio @xmath219 ) . in the first case it is completely flat without plasma contribution .",
    "a qgp contribution creates a big bump at @xmath231 . in the second case , without plasma contribution",
    ", we observe a step structure , with a plateau at @xmath231 . switching on the plasma contribution",
    "creates a steeply falling curve .",
    "we believe that any of these features can be measured and will be very interesting for charm physics at rhic .    in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath3 distribution to be measued at rhic is flat and has a dip in the region @xmath8 .",
    "our calculations indicate that the inclusion of the `` in - plasma born '' @xmath0 s will fill this dip .",
    "of course , there are several improvements that one could do in the in - plasma production , as , for example , the use of a more sophisticated hydrodynamical expansion .",
    "moreover , final state interactions of this component should be considered .",
