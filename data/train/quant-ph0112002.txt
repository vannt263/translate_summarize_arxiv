    "in this section , we briefly describe the theory behind the various entanglement enhanced imaging and measurement protocols . by using results from parameter estimation theory",
    ", we may easily derive the quantum noise limits for uncorrelated measurements , where every sample is independent from every other , and for entanglement - enhanced experiments , where events are corellated . quantum lithography , though technically not an estimation protocol , can also be described with this theory .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to demonstrate the importance of @xmath8 states .",
    "we start with the standard shot - noise limit .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath2 two - level systems in the state @xmath14 , where @xmath3 and @xmath15 are arbitrary labels for the two levels .",
    "if @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 when we repeat this experiment @xmath2 times , we obtain @xmath18 furthermore , it follows from the definition of @xmath19 that @xmath20 on the relevant subspace , and the variance of @xmath19 given @xmath2 samples is readily computed to be @xmath21 . according to estimation theory @xcite , we have @xmath22 this is the standard variance in the parameter @xmath7 after @xmath2 trials . in other words ,",
    "the uncertainty in the phase is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of trials .",
    "this is the shot - noise limit .    with the help of quantum entanglement we can improve this parameter estimation by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "we will now employ the path - entangled input state @xmath24 , where @xmath1 is a product collective state of the @xmath2 qubits .",
    "the relative phase @xmath25 can be obtained by a unitary evolution of one of the modes of @xmath26 .",
    "when we measure an observable @xmath27 again , @xmath28 on the relevant subspace , and @xmath29 using eq .",
    "( [ est ] ) again , we obtain the so - called heisenberg limit to the minimal detectable phase : @xmath30 here , we see that the precision in @xmath7 is increased by a factor @xmath23 over the standard noise limit , when we exploit quantum entanglement . as shown in bollinger _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ bol ] ) is the optimal accuracy permitted by the heisenberg uncertainty principle . in quantum lithography ,",
    "one exploits the @xmath31 behaviour , exhibited by eq .",
    "( [ cosn ] ) , to print closely spaced lines on a suitable substrate @xcite .",
    "gyroscopy and entanglement - enhanced frequency measurements @xcite exploit the @xmath23 increased precision .",
    "the physical interpretations of @xmath32 and the phase @xmath7 might differ in the different protocols .",
    "in this section , we discuss the creation of large , photon - number path entanglement using only linear optics and photodetectors .",
    "we first identify the practical difficulties of conditioning on non - detection , and then , instead , we introduce a generalizable scheme to create photon number path entanglement based on actual detection .      previously , we have shown that it is possible to create up to @xmath33 states with linear optics and projective measurements @xcite . subsequently , it was shown by fiurek @xcite and zou _",
    "et al_.  @xcite that , in principle , one can create any two - mode , entangled , photon - number eigenstate with linear optics and good fock - state sources .",
    "the difficulty with the fiurek - zou protocols , however , is that they are based on _ non - detection_. there are two problems with this approach : firstly , it means that the protocols are very sensitive to detector losses ; secondly , there is a whole family of reasons why a detector will not register a photon ( not necessarily connected to detector efficiencies ) .",
    "for example , the lasers might have been switched off , or the beams might be misaligned . in these cases",
    "there will be no detector counts .",
    "in such situations the outgoing state is not the required state but the vacuum .",
    "more formally , let @xmath34 be the total state before any detection and @xmath35 the projection operator associated with a non - detection in mode @xmath36 ( in this notation , @xmath37 would be associated with the detection of @xmath38 photons ) .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath39 be the intended outgoing state based on no photons in mode @xmath36 .",
    "a perfect measurement of zero photons in mode @xmath36 corresponds to a projection @xmath35 , which yields a state @xmath40 .",
    "however , in practice the measurement will not be a simple projection operator , but a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this will lead to a different outgoing state : @xmath45 =    c_{0,0 } |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi| + ( 1-c_{0,0})\\ , \\hat{\\sigma}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the density operator due to the noise .",
    "the fidelity of the outgoing state is then given by @xmath47 = c_{0,0}$ ] .    in general",
    ", there are many reasons why a detector might not record a photon .",
    "many of these can be tested ( did i switch my equipment on ? ) , but never all of them .",
    "the crucial observation now is that all of the _ untested _ possibilities are going to contribute to @xmath46 , and @xmath48 may become quite small ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this same argument can be applied to the detection of a single photon ( i.e. , projecting mode @xmath36 onto @xmath49 ) .",
    "there will also be a noise contribution in the form of a density operator analogous to @xmath46 .",
    "the difference is that there are many more reasons a detector will not record the presence of a photon than there are for detecting the photon . as a consequence",
    ", the fidelity of the outgoing state based on detection will be much larger than the fidelity of the state based on non - detection .",
    "when we have a low - fidelity output state , we need to apply postselection .",
    "the output state therefore needs to be actually detected . as long as we do not have suitable quantum non - demolition measurement devices",
    ", the detection of the outgoing state generally precludes its further use in the intended application .",
    "we therefore need a production protocol that yields a high - fidelity output _ state _ ( a notable exception is quantum lithography , where states of different photon number will not contribute to the imaging process @xcite ) .",
    "the question now is , what protocol allows us to create large photon - number path entanglement conditioned upon photodetection ?",
    "this is the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "let us first briefly recall the case of a two - fold coincidence at a beam splitter @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when two indistinguishable photons enter a 50:50 beam splitter in both input modes , the phase relations will be such that the output modes will always be in the state @xmath50 .",
    "this is the operational mechanism of the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometer @xcite . labelling the input modes @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 , and the output modes @xmath51 and @xmath36 , the beam splitter can be characterized by the operator transformations @xmath52 and their hermitean conjugates .",
    "it is now easily verified that @xmath53 transforms into @xmath54 up to an overall phase .",
    "there are no cross terms , which is due to the reciprocal property of the symmetric beam splitter .",
    "however , this lack of cross terms will not generalize beyond @xmath55 , since there there are only a limited number of free parameters available to suppress high-@xmath2 cross terms @xcite .",
    "the critical property of the hom interferometer , which we will use in our protocol , is that two photons from different input modes of the beam splitter can not trigger a two - fold detection coincidence at the output modes .",
    "= 2.0 cm    in this section we first proceed with the general protocol for the creation of @xmath56 , where @xmath2 is even .",
    "the basic element of our protocol is depicted in fig .",
    "two beam splitters split off photons from the main beams @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the reflected modes are then recombined in a 50:50 beam splitter , and the process is post - selected on a two - fold detector coincidence in the outgoing modes @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is assumed initially that our detectors distinguish between one and more photons perfectly , but we consider the case of imperfect detectors below .    since a two - fold detector coincidence can not be due to a single photon in both input beams , this procedure thus takes two photons from either mode @xmath5 or @xmath6 : @xmath59 . to complete the element",
    "we apply a phase shift to mode @xmath6 , the value of which we will determine later .",
    "the protocol for making @xmath8 , with @xmath2 even now requires us to create the input state @xmath60 and stack @xmath61 of our basic elements .",
    "the output state , conditioned on an overall @xmath2-fold detector coincidence with suitable phase shifts , is then @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .    to prove this statement ,",
    "consider the two - photon detection of the basic element as @xmath62 .",
    "we have to repeat this procedure @xmath61 times , yielding @xmath63 in order to obtain the @xmath2-photon path - entangled state , the polynomial in eq .",
    "( [ detection ] ) should be @xmath64 .",
    "this means , from the fundamental theorem of algebra @xcite , that the phase factors @xmath65 are the roots of unity , that is , @xmath66    when @xmath2 is very large , the probability that only two photons are reflected from the main beams becomes very small .",
    "this can be compensated by the use of weighted beam splitters : to split off two photons from an @xmath2-photon state most optimally , one should use a beam splitter with a transmission coefficient @xmath67 .",
    "the probability of a successful state preparation event then scales asymptotically as @xmath68 ( see appendix for proof ) .",
    "so far , we have only considered the detection of an even number of photons . however , for the general case , we also want to generate odd @xmath8 states .",
    "the even case was straightforward , since it involved only two - photon detections , which are naturally implemented as the detection of the two outgoing modes of a beamsplitter .",
    "the odd case , however , requires single photon detectors .",
    "if we allow for non - detection , this is also a straightforward task we just condition on a single detection count in the two outgoing modes of the beam splitter .",
    "but non - detection is exactly what we want to avoid . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate single - photon conditioning in the presence of polarization .",
    "the protocol presented in the previous section generates only even-@xmath2 path - entangled states @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the photons are assumed to have the same polarization . in this section",
    ", we extend this scheme to odd @xmath2 by using the extra degree of freedom of polarization .",
    "the basic element for subtracting a photon from the main modes is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "just as with the even case , above , two beam splitters split off a portion of the main beams @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ". however , now they are recombined in a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the setup is chosen such that a photon originating from mode @xmath5 will be transmitted in the pbs . since the polarization of modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the same , a photon from mode @xmath6 incident on the pbs",
    "would also be transmitted .",
    "however , we really want this photon to be reflected , so that it too ends up in the detector . in this way we erase the which - path information .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is to apply a @xmath69 polarization rotation to this mode .",
    "this will force the photon towards the detector .",
    "the secondary outgoing mode will now be empty , and as a consequence we will ignore it completely .",
    "that is , we do not need to condition this scheme on non - detection .",
    "when we stack these elements @xmath2 times and use the input state @xmath60 , we create a general @xmath8 state .",
    "the phase factors @xmath65 are the @xmath2 roots of unity : @xmath70 note that , as in eq .",
    "( [ phaseover2 ] ) , the phases span the @xmath61 roots of unity .",
    "let us elaborate a bit more on this distinction between non - detection and losing modes to the environment . in any experiment",
    "we trace out the ( unwanted ) coupling to the environment , for the simple reason that we do not have control over all the interactions between our experimental setup and the rest of the universe .",
    "when this coupling is made small ( i.e. , the setup is isolated ) , this is a very good approximation . in the case of the secondary output mode @xmath57 of the pbs , the coupling to the environment is the loss of any photons in that mode .",
    "however , ideally there should not be any photons in that mode this therefore constitutes a weak coupling .",
    "the case of non - detection presupposes a sizeable portion of scattered photons in the outgoing beam , and aims to condition on the absence of these .",
    "we can not trace over this mode , because the coupling to the environment is not weak there are actually photons in that mode .",
    "this means that instead of tracing over the secondary mode , one needs to project it onto the vacuum @xmath71 , which is the source of the non - detection difficulties .",
    "the protocols presented so far are linear , in the sense that we constructed a basic element as a two - mode gate that was repeated a number of times .",
    "this means that the number of detected photons increases linearly with the number of elements , and the efficiency ( which is a product of the success rate of the different components ) therefore scales exponentially poorly .    for practical purposes",
    "it is important to find a scheme which scales logarithmically in the number of detectors , so that we only have polynomial efficiency deterioration .",
    "one protocol that looked promising exploited the unused input ports .",
    "we found that feeding both modes @xmath72 _ and _ modes @xmath73 in the basic element from fig.[fig2 ] with states @xmath8 yields the state @xmath74 based on a two - fold detection coincidence .",
    "however , due to the fact that _ two _ @xmath8 input states are required , the overall scaling was still exponentially poor .",
    "these scaling considerations are important for practical implementations of entanglement - enhanced precision measurements , because an increase in the required resources ( photons ) might outweigh the benefit of gaining a @xmath23 precision improvement .",
    "since the scaling of the resources depends critically on the details of the protocol employed , it is not clear from these general considerations what the overall behaviour of a given network will be .",
    "there are several sources of errors for a detector",
    ". it might fail to signal a photon was present , in which case we speak of a deteriorated efficiency .",
    "alternatively , it might signal the detection of a photon , even though no photon was actually present . this",
    "is called a dark count .",
    "since we only consider schemes that operate in short time windows , these dark counts can be neglected .",
    "finally , the detector might not be able to distinguish between one or more photons .",
    "such a detector does not have single - photon resolution @xcite .",
    "we can see immediately that imperfect detection efficiency is going to affect the scaling law .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic scaling will behave as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the ( asymptotic ) probability of creating the state based on @xmath2 detected photons and @xmath77 is the detector efficiency .",
    "that is , the protocol scales exponentially poorly with the detector efficiency , as expected .",
    "here we have taken identical detectors throughout the scheme .",
    "when we use detectors with a single - photon resolution but limited efficiency , two photons can easily be mistaken for a single photon .",
    "that is , one of them might not be detected .",
    "when the occurrence of a two - photon state is very unlikely , this is not so much of a problem , but when it is likely , the output state will be significantly degraded .",
    "unfortunately , in our protocol the beam splitter strips off two photons on average , which means that it is quite likely that more than two photons end up in the detector .",
    "this way , our scheme has become a protocol conditioned on the non - detection of two - photon states , which is exactly what we wanted to avoid .",
    "however , there is a way to mend this drawback : when we increase the transmittivity of the beam splitter , the probability of having more than two photons in the detectors will decrease .",
    "therefore , at the cost of a lower production rate ( i.e. , low efficiency ) , we can maintain high - quality @xmath8 states ( high fidelity ) .",
    "this adjustment is not possible in non - detection schemes .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated a general , detection - based protocol to create @xmath8 states for use in entanglement - enhanced parameter estimation .",
    "existing protocols are less practical because they either require @xmath9 nonlinearities near unity @xcite , or they condition on non - detection @xcite .",
    "currently , @xmath9 nonlinearities are very small @xcite , and we argued that non - detection schemes are problematic in their experimental implementation .    we have shown that one can indeed create arbitrary latexmath:[$|n,0\\rangle +    single - photon detections . for the case of odd @xmath2 we needed to invoke the extra freedom of polarization .",
    "the protocol presented here is the generalization of our previous work @xcite , which was succesful in creating path - entangled states up to @xmath79 .",
    "this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . in addition , p.k .  and h.l.acknowledge the united states national research council .",

    "support was received from the office of naval research , advanced research and development activity , national security agency and the defense advanced research projects agency .",
    "we will now prove the asymptotic scaling law for even @xmath80 states .",
    "let the transmission and reflection coefficient of the beam splitter be given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with @xmath83 .",
    "the probability of reflecting @xmath84 out of @xmath2 photons is then given by @xmath85 , from which it immediately follows that @xmath86 .",
    "the event where two photons are reflected from one beam splitter and none from the other then occurs with probability @xmath87 , where the factor of 2 takes into account the fact that we do not know from which mode the two photons originate .",
    "furthermore , we are post - selecting on two - fold coincidences , which means that we have an extra factor of @xmath88 that incorporates the reduced probability that the two photons branch off at the beam splitter . by maximizing the expression @xmath89 we found that the optimal transmission coefficient is given by @xmath90 .",
    "the total probability of finding a two - fold detector coincidence is then given by @xmath91 using sterling s formula @xmath92 , we find that for large @xmath2 the protocol scales as @xmath93 .",
