    "melzer followed schur s approach and conjectured finitizations similar to those in ( [ finiterr ] ) .",
    "however , melzer s polynomial identities were sufficiently complicated not to lead to a straightforward proof using recurrences .",
    "it was only after melzer proved the cases @xmath18 ( ising ) and @xmath19 ( tricritical ising )  @xcite that berkovich succeeded in proving recurrences for the polynomial identities for all @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a combinatorial proof for melzer s identities , based on yet another observation made by melzer . again",
    "the motivation for this has been the original rogers - ramanujan identities ( [ rr ] ) , whose finitization ( [ finiterr ] ) can be viewed as evaluations of the sum @xmath21 in two intrinsically different ways .",
    "similar to this , melzer has argued that the polynomial identities for the finitized @xmath17 characters arise from computing the sums @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will take this observation as the starting point for proving the polynomial and rogers  ramanujan identities for the ( finitized ) characters @xmath17 .",
    "that is , we give two different methods to compute ( [ confsums ] ) , one leading to a so called _ fermionic _ expression similar to the left - hand side of ( [ finiterr ] ) and one method leading to a so - called _ bosonic _ expression similar to the right - hand side of ( [ finiterr ] ) .",
    "in fact , it should be noted that @xmath25 defined above is exactly the _ one - dimensional configuration sum _ @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , as defined by andrews , baxter and forrester in their computation of the order parameters of the @xmath28-state abf model in regime iii @xcite . hence computing the sum ( [ confsums ] )",

    "the fact that ( finitized ) rogers  ramanujan identities arise from calculating order parameters of solvable lattice models is in fact not new , and indeed the sum ( [ hhm ] ) is exactly the one encountered by baxter in his solution of the hard hexagon model in regime  i  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe melzer s polynomial identities , their limiting rogers  ramanujan type form and some other virasoro character identities that follow from the proof of melzer s identities and the application of the andrews ",
    "bailey construction  @xcite .",
    "then , in section  3 , we compute the configuration sums @xmath29 using the technique developed in part i of this paper @xcite . this amounts to reinterpreting the sum ( [ confsums ] ) as the grand canonical partition function of a one - dimensional gas of charged particles obeying certain fermi - type exclusion rules . in section  4",
    "we describe the original approach of abf for computing ( [ confsums ] ) using recurrence relations .",
    "together with the result of section  3 this proves melzer s polynomial identities .",
    "we finally end with a discussion of our result and an outlook to related problems and generalizations .",
    "to end this introduction we make some further remarks on the problem described in this paper .",
    "first , as mentioned before , an altogether different kind of proof of melzer s identities has recently been given for the case of @xmath30 by berkovich @xcite .",
    "this method of proof , which in fact is applicable to all unitary minimal characters @xcite , is based on recursive instead of combinatorial arguments .",
    "second , in their solution of the abf model , andrews , baxter and forrester also considered the configuration sums @xmath26 , with @xmath31 . hence",
    "to completely compute all configuration sums of the abf model , more general sums than those defined in ( [ confsums ] ) have to be considered",
    ". however , from simple symmetry arguments @xcite ( see also section 3 ) one can easily deduce that computing ( [ confsums ] ) suffices to obtain expressions for all @xmath26 .    finally we remark that melzer  @xcite and kedem _ et al . _  @xcite conjecture ( in the general case ) four fermionic expressions for each ( finitized ) character .",
    "in this paper we give detailed proof of only two of the four . for the remaining two representations we did not succeed in finding a derivation in terms of a fermi lattice - gas .    in this section",
    "we give a summary of identities proven by the calculations carried out in the sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] .",
    "first we describe the polynomial identities conjectured by melzer  @xcite , and their limiting rogers  ramanujan type form as discovered by the stony brook group  @xcite .",
    "then we list two classes of character identities for non - unitary minimal models which , as recently pointed out by foda and quano @xcite , arise from melzer s identities and the andrews  bailey construction  @xcite .",
    "before we state the polynomial identities as conjectured by melzer , we need some notation .",
    "we denote the incidence matrix of the a@xmath32 dynkin diagram by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the cartan matrix of a@xmath32 is denoted as @xmath36 , and is related to @xmath33 by @xmath37 .",
    "we also define the @xmath38-dimensional ( column ) vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and set @xmath44 , @xmath45 . with this notation , using the gaussian polynomials as defined in ( [ qpoly ] ) , melzer s conjectures can be stated as the following identities for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath46 : to mean @xmath47 also , the sums @xmath48 and @xmath49 are shorthand notations for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . ] @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 we note that in our derivation of the left - hand side of ( [ mid ] ) in section  3 , this restriction naturally arises in the following form , @xmath55-equivalent to ( [ qrest ] ) : @xmath56    in ref .",
    "@xcite , yet another expression for the left - hand side of ( [ mid ] ) was conjectured as @xmath57 where @xmath58 with @xmath59 . clearly , for @xmath60 and for @xmath61 the fermionic expressions in ( [ mid ] ) and ( [ mid2 ] ) coincide .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we have no explanation of this alternative fermionic form in terms of a fermi - gas , and ( [ mid2 ] ) is listed only for completeness .    taking the finitization parameter @xmath62 to infinity , ( [ mid ] )",

    "hence we have two different fermionic representations for each character of the unitary minimal series .",
