    "a quantum dot ( qd ) in high magnetic fields ,  @xcite so - called quantum hall droplet ,  @xcite represents an exciting playground for correlation effects in interacting electron systems .",
    "some possible effects can be found in transport measurements that detect oscillations in magnetoconductance @xcite in the interval @xmath0 of filling factors .",
    "the associated minima of the current amplitude are most completely understood taking into account a tendency of the system to find itself in _ depolarized _ , highly correlated ground states at some fractions in between despite zeeman cost.@xcite in this paper we will introduce closely related depolarized states as meron topological excitations of the @xmath1 completely polarized droplet , therefore extending topological models to a finite system .",
    "they will represent relevant lowest lying - ground state configurations of the droplet when gyromagnetic ratio is small .",
    "whenever we think about quasiparticles in small systems we are skeptical about their existence or clear cut description that we can find in infinite systems .",
    "that is even more true if we deal with quasiparticles which quantization can be based on topological considerations like skyrmions in quantum hall ( qh ) ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , as we will argue here , topological objects like merons , a meron is a half of skyrmion ,  @xcite can exist as lowest lying states of a quantum hall droplet .",
    "therefore fractionalization and quantization , characteristic to qh systems , may persist even in small spin unpolarized systems bringing topological objects to their description .",
    "the spin characterization of qd states at realistic zeeman coupling is an open problem .",
    "@xcite a very thorough understanding of the completely polarized case exists that includes a description of the qd states by the way of a vortex quantization .",
    "@xcite the introduction of higher angular momentum states or the increase of magnetic field with respect to the most compact , maximum density configuration of a dot is followed by vortex appearance inside the dot . on the other hand",
    "there is a need to introduce a classification to various ( partially polarized ) states at arbitrary or realistic zeeman coupling .",
    "@xcite in the previous work , ref .  , by one of the present authors , the coulomb interaction problem of small quantum hall droplets ( dots ) with @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 is the number of electrons , in the limit of zero zeeman coupling , was studied by exact diagonalization , in the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "it was shown that the lowest lying states of these small quantum hall droplets can be described and classified as states of merons . in this work",
    "we address the question of the existence of meron ground states in large quantum hall droplets , @xmath5 , that exact diagonalizations can not reach . at the same time , by extrapolation , we will be able to estimate the size of the quantum hall droplet , @xmath6 , at which meron confinement takes place i.e. when we can not expect meron ground states",
    ". we will be able to do this by using a model wave function that describes a meron of arbitrary winding number positioned at the center of a droplet . in this sense",
    "our approach is variational , takes into account a mean field description of a meron , and compares it energetically first with the ground state - maximum density droplet ( mdd ) spin polarized configuration , but also with other meron configurations - of different winding number .",
    "at the heart of the theory of the quantum hall systems at effective small gyromagnetic ratio , and filling factor @xmath1 , i.e. quantum hall ferromagnets , is the commensuration of spin and charge deviations from the ground state values .",
    "@xcite exchange interaction prefers smooth tumbling of spins that follows changes in the charge distribution .",
    "topology plays an important role in the theory of infinite size quantum hall ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite after the spontaneous symmetry breaking the polarization of the ground state is in a definite direction and fixes the boundary condition at infinite radius . due to",
    "then possible mapping between real and internal ( spin ) spaces , the skyrmion excitations with nontrivial value of topological charge , and the same value of electric charge implied by the commensuration , can be identified .",
    "this classical ( nonlinear-@xmath7 model ) skyrmion solution finds a concrete quantum - mechanical realization in the following construction @xcite @xmath8 \\prod_{i < j } ( z_{i } - z_{j}).\\ ] ] we omitted gaussian factors and @xmath9 s are 2d coordinates of @xmath4 electrons in the lowest landau level ( lll ) in units of the magnetic length , @xmath10 . in this construction the coordinates ( in the orbital part ) participate in the spinor part . the complex number @xmath11 denotes the size of the skyrmion signifying the characteristic length when the spin , which is around the center pointing up , starts gradually pointing down as it does at infinity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is finite , determined by the ratio between the strength of the interaction and the zeeman coupling .",
    "now we specialize to the case of a droplet .",
    "we simplify the matters assuming that the gyromagnetic factor is zero .",
    "thus we are in a scale invariant situation where @xmath11 may be function only of the size ( @xmath4 ) of the system .",
    "we take @xmath13 ,  @xcite and consider constructions for merons of the following form @xmath14 \\prod_{i < j } ( z_{i } - z_{j}),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a positive integer .",
    "the mean angular momentum @xmath16 can be easily ( numerically ) calculated and with respect to the ground state value , @xmath17 , we find that @xmath18 approximate very well the calculated @xmath19 , the better , the larger @xmath4 is ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    therefore , for @xmath20 , the excitation , in the mean , is the excitation of one half of the flux quantum , @xmath21 being the excitation of ( laughlin s quasi ) hole of one flux quantum or a vortex .",
    "a skyrmion is a generalization of a laughlin quasihole in the case of quantum hall ferromagnets .",
    "we may then identify the construction with a classical one for a single meron being `` half of the skyrmion '' , and carrying flux of one half of one flux quantum ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "also its magnetization , from pointing up in the center , gradually transforms into one in the plane ( @xmath23 ) on the edges resembling the half of the skyrmion .",
    "@xcite in the case of a skyrmion the magnetization would proceed to transform into configuration that points down on the edges with equal magnitude but opposite direction with respect to the configuration at the center . for a detailed description of the single meron ( eq .",
    "( [ mnn ] ) with @xmath24 ) see below and fig .",
    "now we will show the results of the calculations of the total ( interaction plus confining ) energy with respect to a suitable hamiltonian of the states expressed by eq.([mnn ] ) .",
    "the interaction part of the hamiltonian we work with can be described as a truncated pseudopotential interaction @xcite with only pseudopotentials @xmath25 for @xmath26 nonzero and positive .",
    "here @xmath27 is the relative angular momentum of a pair of electrons in the lll .",
    "precisely , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the projector of a state in the lll of the pair @xmath30 to the definite relative angular momentum value @xmath27 .",
    "we consider @xmath31 much larger than @xmath32 , making the state in eq.([mnn ] ) with @xmath33 a unique ground state ( up to su(2 ) rotation ) of the system at filling factor one .",
    "in addition to @xmath34 we choose @xmath35 because we want to break energy degeneracy among topological constructions implied by the hard core ( only @xmath36 ) model .",
    "@xcite for an explanation how to implement the model interaction with pseudopotentials see appendix . that meron excitations ( described in mean field as central constructions by eq.([mnn ] ) ) are indeed lowest lying states of a small droplet was shown in ref .   by exact diagonalization in the case of the coulomb interaction",
    "the interaction energy of the ground state we calculated taking @xmath37 in @xmath38 and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "we see the dependence of the interaction energy per particle on the size - the number of particles in the system",
    ". the energy can be very accurately fitted with the analytical expression in the figure as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath39 .",
    "( @xmath39 is the measure of the radius of the system . )",
    "the same analytical expression can be found just considering the sizes up to @xmath40 .",
    "the expectation values ( interaction energies per particle ) of the meron states ( eq.([mnn ] ) with @xmath41 ) with respect to the ground state value are plotted in fig .",
    "3 along with analytical fits .",
    "again we take @xmath37 and there are no contributions from the first pseudopotential @xmath31 because the states in eq.([mnn ] ) are zero energy eigenstates with respect to that pseudopotential .",
    "the analytical fits are expansions in inverse powers of @xmath39 , which is the measure of the radius of the system .",
    "the expectation values come with overall negative sign with respect to the ground state value as each excitation represents an inflation of the volume of the system and therefore increase in the average distance and decrease in the interaction among particles .",
    "nevertheless , we can find extrapolating the fitted analytical expressions to larger number of particles and system sizes that the positive first term ( small but always present and approximately proportional to a constant times @xmath15 ) will overcome all other terms in the @xmath42 limit .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath43 and positive , the merons are not present in the excitation spectrum . like vortices in the xy model",
    "they are confined in pairs as skyrmion excitations .    in a strong magnetic field and realistic situation with a harmonic confining potential ,",
    "we can model the confining part of the hamiltonian as @xmath44 @xmath19 is the angular momentum measured with respect to the ground state value , eq.([mom ] ) , and @xmath45 is a positive constant .",
    "then we may expect ( due to the positive third terms in the expressions in fig .",
    "3 with nearly @xmath46 behavior ) that in the case of the hamiltonian , @xmath47 the system is prone to the instabilities ( spin reconstructions ) described by the meron excitations in eq.([mnn ] ) .",
    "thus we plotted the total energy of a droplet with @xmath48 , fig . 4 ,    for a few @xmath49 ( c - critical ) when the total energy of the excitation with fixed @xmath15 equals the energy of the one with @xmath50 .",
    "this is a situation when one ground state with fixed @xmath15 becomes less favorable with decreasing @xmath45 and substituted with another one with the meron number equal to @xmath50 .",
    "somehow , as an only exception , our mean field approach predicts that the @xmath51 state reconstruction precedes the one with @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "this is very likely an artifact of our choice of the interaction potential ( eq.([iham ] ) ) .",
    "the implied ground states are only possible when the size of the system is not large that the first and the second term in the expansions of the interaction energies become comparable in size .",
    "approximately this happens when @xmath53 as can be seen from the analytical fits in fig .",
    "3 .    with a view on the theory of the evolution of a quantum dot with magnetic field in ref .   in terms of completely polarized states incorporating ( quasi)hole excitations , and its reasonable agreement with experiment ,  @xcite the meron evolution that we advocate would occur at much smaller gyromagnetic ratio ( or stronger interaction strength ) .",
    "further merons of higher meron number ( @xmath15 = 2 or 3 ) , `` giant merons '' , are highly unlikely in larger droplets , @xmath54 , as described in ref .  .",
    "this will likely cause that implied @xmath55 periodicity would be slightly modified , as entering merons would accomodate also on orbitals away , off the center just in the case of vortex excitations in the completely polarized case .",
    "@xcite    to illustrate the bulk single meron configuration that the construction in eq.([mnn ] ) for @xmath24 represents we plotted in fig . 5 its spin density @xmath56 and charge density @xmath57 as functions of the 2d coordinate @xmath58 in the case of @xmath59 the analytic expressions ( which are plotted ) for spin density @xmath60 are @xmath61 and for charge density @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 therefore we have @xmath65 from fig . 5 and",
    "these expressions we can conclude that for @xmath66 we have a description of a single meron that is created in the bulk of the system .",
    "close to the boundary @xmath60 vector lies in the 2d plane and rotates for @xmath67 as expected for a meron .",
    "now , we must pose a question which quantum mechanical states - eigenstates of @xmath16 and @xmath68 , correspond to the `` mean - field '' or `` classical '' constructions expressed by eq.([mnn ] ) .",
    "we will take that each meron classical construction corresponds to the quantum mechanical state that we find by expanding the spinor part of eq.([mnn ] ) with eigenvalue of @xmath16 corresponding to the expectation value in eq.([mom ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the states that were proposed for spin ( global not only edge ) reconstructions in ref .",
    "are of the following form @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 denotes the filled with @xmath4 spin @xmath71 particles lll - a vandermonde determinant , and @xmath72 , an exciton operator with @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the electron creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath75 denoting single - particle angular momentum .",
    "@xmath76 , if @xmath4 is even , and after a little inspection we can find out that the state described by the formula coincides with our quantum mechanical eigenstate analog of the construction in eq.([mnn ] ) with @xmath15 equal to one . as we now show explicitly , in the case of the merons of eq.([mnn ] ) , these constructions carry very small @xmath68 . the states in eq.([mnn ] ) are eigenstates of @xmath77 with eigenvalues @xmath78 .",
    "@xcite therefore @xmath79 in these states is @xmath80 and @xmath81 for merons .    to find out whether even in small droplets the mean field ansatz has a distribution of participating eigenstates of @xmath16 ( and @xmath68 ) very much peaked around the quantum mechanical states with @xmath19 given in eq.([mom ] ) , we calculated these distributions ( fig .",
    "6 ) in the cases of a droplet with @xmath82 and @xmath40 .",
    "although our trial functions are not eigenstates of the angular momentum , the calculated participation ratios , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are indeed well peaked around expectation values , @xmath86",
    "the meron physics we described above should be in principle detectable in lateral quantum dots , in which interaction effects are strong , in their not yet explored regime beyond the mdd state ,  @xcite as well just below the mdd state where depolarized @xmath87 states were already discovered .",
    "@xcite    besides the study in ref .   of small systems , there are studies in refs .   without the lll approximation that find depolarized states that we can identify as meron ground states .",
    "they appear at angular momenta , multiplets of @xmath55 , for @xmath4 even .",
    "here we addressed the question of the existence of the meron ground states in larger quantum hall droplets .",
    "our conclusion is , as long as the zeeman term is small , the meron ground states are viable solutions of these droplets for @xmath88 smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "also we expect the appearance of merons in any small enough system of particles with the lowest landau level quantization and a degenerate , additional degree of freedom .",
    "that may happen in graphene structures in the presence of magnetic field ( with valley degree of freedom ) or rapidly rotating quantum gases ( with spin degree of freedom ) .",
    "a previous study , ref .  , of few - electron qnatum dots , without the zeeman term , was based on restricted ( conditional ) wave function ( rwf ) method .",
    "@xcite as the method underlines explicit fixing of the spin projection of each electron , the vortices observed are analogous to those of polarized systems . a more detailed and recent study in ref .",
    "is based on the same method and discusses the problem of two distinguishable species of bosons or fermions which rapidly rotate . as usual in these circumstances the lll approximation is applied and the fermion system is ( up to the difference caused by the distinguishability ) the same as in the case of the quantum hall droplet discussed in this paper .",
    "the first vortices that enter the mdd come at the increase of angular momentum of @xmath55 .",
    "due to being just vortices of one kind of fermions , a density of fermions of another kind at their core was detected . because of this phenomenon these vortices are called coreless vortices . for a larger droplet @xmath90",
    "it was demonstrated using dft ( density functional theory ) and the rwf method that a coreless vortex enters the droplet ( at an angular momentum slightly higher than that of mdd ) . based on these observations , i.e. that coreless vortices",
    "as merons show an increase of polarization at their core ( center ) , and our studies we can conclude that merons are the solutions of the quantum hall droplet in the fully spin rotationally invariant case , i.e. in an indistinguishable picture , and correspond to these coreless vortices in the distinguishable picture .",
    "this work was supported by grants no .",
    "141035 , 141017 , and 141014 of the serbian ministry of science .",
    "first we consider a fixed spin configuration - component of the total wave function which expectation value of the interaction energy we want to calculate : @xmath91 @xmath92 in general does not have any overall definite symmetry property ( i.e. it is not antisymmetric or symmetric in general ) .",
    "we first have to perform the calculation for each component @xmath92 separately and then add contributions .",
    "we do the calculation by performing the projection to angular momentum , @xmath93 , component of wave function @xmath92 for each pair of particles @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the component can be extracted by expanding @xmath92 in powers of @xmath96 and @xmath97 i.e. @xmath98 and taking only @xmath99 contribution - wave function in the expansion . because we take @xmath100 , the normalized , integrated over all coordinates square of the projection would be the contribution to the interaction energy from the given spin configuration @xmath92 and fixed pair of particles .",
