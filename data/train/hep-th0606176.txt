    "the nontrivial vacuum structure of @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory allows for the existence of regular non - perturbative finite mass solutions , such as spherically symmetric monopoles @xcite , axially symmetric multimonopoles @xcite and monopole - antimonopole pairs @xcite .",
    "recently , more general static equilibrium solutions have been constructed , representing either chains of @xmath1 alternating monopoles and antimonopoles , carrying charge @xmath3 , or vortex ring configurations @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric ",
    "t hooft  polyakov monopole of unit charge @xcite is a topologically stable solution of the field equations . in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit of vanishing higgs potential axially",
    "symmetric multimonopole configurations are known analytically @xcite . in these solutions",
    "the nodes of the higgs field are superimposed at a single point . in the bps limit",
    "repulsive and attractive forces between monopoles exactly compensate and bps monopoles experience no net interaction @xcite . indeed , calculating",
    "the number of zero modes of the configurations shows that they can be continuously deformed into systems of individual monopoles with unit topological charge @xcite .",
    "when the higgs field becomes massive , the fine balance of forces between the monopoles is broken since the corresponding attractive yukawa interaction becomes short - ranged , and consequently the non - bps monopoles experience repulsion @xcite .    as shown by taubes @xcite",
    ", each topological sector contains besides the ( multi)monopole solutions further regular , finite mass solutions , which do not satisfy the first order bogomolnyi equations , but only the set of second order field equations , even for vanishing higgs potential .",
    "such solutions , representing for instance static axially symmetric monopole - antimonopole chain and vortex ring configurations @xcite , form saddlepoints of the energy functional , and possess a mass above the bogomolnyi bound .",
    "they exist because the attractive short - range forces between the poles , that are mediated by the @xmath4 vector boson and the higgs boson , are balanced by the repulsion , which is mediated by the massive vector bosons @xmath5 . in the topologically trivial sector",
    "the simplest of these saddlepoint solutions represents a monopole - antimonopole pair , forming a magnetic dipole @xcite .",
    "when the charge @xmath3 of the monopole and antimonopole increases beyond @xmath6 , it becomes favourable for the monopole - antimonopole system to form a vortex ring , at least for small values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "likewise , larger monopole - antimonopole chains then form several vortex rings @xcite . for large values of the higgs boson mass also more complicated configurations can appear",
    ", which consist of monopole - antimonopole pairs or chains as well as vortex rings @xcite .",
    "the presence of an external interaction is also known to change the node structure of a configuration @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we investigate the dependence of such ymh solutions on the strength of the higgs selfcoupling @xmath2 , and thus the value of the higgs boson mass .",
    "we find that , for large values of the higgs selfcoupling , new branches of equilibrium configurations arise for monopole - antimonopole systems with @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , we report the existence of new types of solutions with winding number @xmath7 and @xmath8 and compare their properties to those of the known solutions @xcite .",

    "these @xmath7 solutions have been studied before @xcite .",
    "when @xmath53 , they consist of a single vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane . when @xmath55 , they consist of two opposite vortex rings located symmetrically above and below the @xmath54-plane together with a triple pole at the origin . when @xmath56 , they consist of two like vortex rings located symmetrically above and below the @xmath54-plane .    as @xmath2",
    "is increased from zero , each of these solutions gives rise to a branch of solutions , to which we refer as the respective fundamental branches .",
    "interestingly , at critical values of @xmath2 , pairs of new branches of solutions appear , whose node structure differs from the node structure of the solutions of the corresponding fundamental branches .      _",
    "@xmath53 _ :    let us start with the simplest case , the @xmath7 , @xmath53 solutions , which possess a single vortex ring along their fundamental branch .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the mass of the solutions increases along the fundamental branch . at the same time , the radius of the single dipole ring in the @xmath54-plane decreases slowly .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of the mass and the location of the vortex ring @xmath57 of the solutions along the fundamental branch are shown in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] .     [ f-1 ]    while the fundamental branch persists as @xmath2 increases , a new solution appears at a critical value @xmath58 .",
    "this solution has higher mass than the fundamental solution , and it has a different node structure : its higgs field possesses two isolated nodes on the symmetry axis , representing a monopole - antimonopole pair with charges @xmath59 .    as @xmath2 is increased now , two new branches of solutions arise from this critical solution , which differ in mass .",
    "the solutions on the lower ( mass ) branch retain the node structure of the critical solution .",
    "their two isolated nodes on the symmetry axis change only slightly in distance with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "their energy density exhibits two tori , whose position is associated with the nodes of the higgs field , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] .     [ f-2 ]",
    "the solutions on the upper ( mass ) branch , in contrast , do not retain the node structure of the critical solution for long .",
    "their isolated nodes on the symmetry axis approach each other rapidly , and merge at the origin at a second critical value @xmath60 .",
    "thus at @xmath61 we observe a transition from a monopole - antimonopole pair solution to a vortex ring solution . beyond @xmath61",
    "the radius of the ring first increases rapidly and then decreases slowly again .",
    "both new branches of solutions are also shown in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] .",
    "we illustrate the new solutions further in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ] , where we exhibit the modulus of the higgs field @xmath62 and the gauge function @xmath63 along the symmetry axis and in the @xmath54-plane for two values of coupling constant @xmath2 . for @xmath64 both solutions",
    "possess isolated nodes on the symmetry axis , but for the solution on the lower ( mass ) branch these are farther apart .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath65 the solution on the upper branch has a small ring in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "[ f-3 ]    although beyond @xmath61 the new upper branch solutions possess the same node structure as the solutions on the fundamental branch , the size of their vortex ring is much smaller and their mass remains considerably higher .",
    "however , since the mass of the new lower branch increases more slowly with @xmath2 than the mass of the fundamental branch , a further critical value of @xmath2 appears , @xmath66 , where the mass of the solution of the fundamental branch coincides with the mass of the solution of the lower branch .",
    "@xmath67 thus marks the transition , where it becomes energetically favourable for the field configuration to have two triple nodes on the symmetry axis instead of a single large vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane .    for larger values of the higgs selfcoupling the subtle interplay between repulsive and attractive forces",
    "thus allows for more than one non - trivial equilibrium configuration . analyzing the various contributions to the total mass of these configurations shows , that the kinetic energy of the higgs field is smallest for the solutions on the fundamental branch ( except for a small range of @xmath2 close to the first critical point ) .",
    "but the potential energy of the higgs field and the kinetic energy of the gauge fields are smallest for the solutions on the new lower branch , for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "concerning the total energy balance it then becomes favourable for the higgs field to form pointlike isolated nodes instead of extended vortex - like nodes , thus causing a transition from a vortex ring to a monopole - antimonopole pair configuration at a critical value of @xmath2 .    _",
    "@xmath56 _ :    we now turn to the @xmath7 , @xmath56 solutions .",
    "the fundamental @xmath7 , @xmath56 solutions possess two vortex rings located symmetrically with respect to the @xmath54-plane .",
    "their radius @xmath68 almost coincides with their distance @xmath69 from the plane , as seen in fig .",
    "their location and size varies slowly with @xmath2 .",
    "[ f-4 ]    as @xmath2 is increased , again a critical value @xmath70 is encountered , where two new branches of solutions arise , possessing higher mass and a different node structure than the solutions on the fundamental branch .",
    "the new solutions possess two outer nodes on the symmetry axis , as well as a vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "thus these solutions present a new type of solution with mixed node structure .    with increasing @xmath2 the solutions on the lower ( mass ) branch again retain this node structure , keeping two isolated nodes on the symmetry axis and a vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane . the solutions on the upper ( mass ) branch",
    ", however , again do not retain this node structure for long .",
    "their single vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane decreases rapidly in size , and reaches zero size at a second critical value @xmath71 . at @xmath61",
    "we then observe the transition to a monopole - antimonopole chain solution , possessing four isolated nodes on the symmetry axis .",
    "their node structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f-5 ] , where the modulus of the higgs field is exhibited for both ( types of ) new solutions at @xmath72 .",
    "[ f-5 ]    interestingly , the new inner nodes approach each other again , and coalesce at the origin at a further critical value , @xmath73 . beyond @xmath67",
    "the solutions possess again two outer nodes on the symmetry axis , and a small vortex ring in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "the mass and the nodes along the new branches of solutions are also shown in fig .",
    "[ f-4 ] .",
    "concerning the mass of the new solutions , we again observe a transition between the fundamental branch and the new lower ( mass ) branch : beyond @xmath74 the new lower branch solutions are energetically favourable , i.e.  it becomes again advantageous to exchange vortex rings for isolated nodes .",
    "the new lowest mass solution thus contains instead of two vortex rings only a single vortex ring and two nodes on the symmetry axis beyond @xmath75 .    continuing this reasoning it is tempting to conjecture , that a further critical value of @xmath2 might exist",
    ", where another pair of branches would appear with now four isolated nodes on the symmetry axis , representing thus monopole - antimonopole chains , and the solutions on this ( conjectured ) lower ( mass ) branch would become the energetically most favourable configurations for high values of @xmath2 .",
    "so far we considered solutions of the topologically trivial sector .",
    "let us now address the @xmath2-dependence of solutions in the sector with topological charge @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath76 , the @xmath7 , @xmath55 solutions possess a triply charged monopole at the origin and two oppositely oriented vortex rings located symmetrically above and below the @xmath54-plane @xcite .",
    "based on the observations in the topologically trivial sector we expect a bifurcation at a critical value of @xmath2 , where two new branches of solutions appear , which possess a node structure different from the solutions on the fundamental branch .",
    "furthermore , for high values of @xmath2 the energetically most favourable solutions should represent monopole - antimonopole chains .",
    "constructing the solutions confirms these expectations , but in a surprising way : the node structure of the solutions changes already along the fundamental branch , and the fundamental branch and the new lower branch merge and end at a critical value of @xmath2 , while beyond this critical value only the new upper branch persists , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] .",
    "[ f-6 ]    considering the @xmath2-dependence of the solutions in detail , we observe that with increasing @xmath2 the radius of the vortex rings decreases while the vortex rings first move closer towards each other and then roughly retain their distance .",
    "then , at a critical value @xmath77 , two nodes emerge from the origin and separate from each other along the @xmath47-axis .. ] thus beyond @xmath78 the solutions on the fundamental branch possess three nodes on the symmetry axis and two vortex rings located symmetrically above and below the @xmath54-plane .",
    "as @xmath2 increases further , the new nodes move further apart , while the vortex rings shrink to zero size and merge with the new nodes on the @xmath47-axis at a critical value @xmath79 .",
    "beyond @xmath61 , the solutions possess only three isolated nodes on the symmetry axis and represent monopole - antimonopole chains .- dependence of the nodes of the solutions with fixed @xmath7 and @xmath55 is very similar to the @xmath36-dependence of the nodes of the solutions with fixed @xmath80 and @xmath55 @xcite . ]",
    "we note though , that for a small range of @xmath2 , @xmath81 , three branches of solutions are present , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f-6 ] . clearly , at @xmath82 two new branches of solutions appear which possess the node structure of monopole - antimonopole chains .",
    "the new lower branch then merges with the fundamental branch at @xmath83 , where both branches end , while the upper branch extends to high values of @xmath2 .",
    "the modulus of the higgs field and the energy density of several @xmath7 , @xmath55 solutions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f-7 ] .",
    "we have investigated static axially symmetric solutions of the @xmath0 yang - mills - higgs theory , representing monopole - antimonopole chains and vortex rings , and obtained new types of solutions , representing mixed chain - vortex ring configurations .",
    "starting from vortex ring solutions in the limit of vanishing higgs selfcoupling constant @xmath2 , we observe that at critical values of @xmath2 pairs of new branches of solutions appear .",
    "thus for larger values of @xmath2 the subtle interplay between repulsive and attractive forces allows for more than one non - trivial equilibrium configuration of these systems .",
    "the new branches of solutions possess a different node structure , where , in particular , vortex rings are replaced by isolated nodes on the symmetry axis . for high values of @xmath2",
    "these new solutions have the lowest mass .",
    "while we have studied here in detail only the systems with @xmath7 and @xmath52 , we conjecture , that this phenomenon is not restricted to these particular systems but that it is of a more general nature , implicating an enormous richness of configuration space for high values of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , it appears interesting to consider the effects of gravity on these new types of solutions , and thus to obtain the gravitating analoga of these regular solutions as well as the corresponding non - abelian black holes solutions , if they exist @xcite .",
