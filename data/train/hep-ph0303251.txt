    "the @xmath0 ( or ` di - photon ' ) inclusive signature is possibly the most studied one experimentally , in the context of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , since it allows for the detection of a relatively light ( @xmath4 gev ) neutral higgs boson , both within the standard model ( sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the existence of such a light particle state has been hinted already by lep2 data , both as a possible resonance in the region @xmath5 gev and as the mass range that best accommodates the higher order higgs boson contributions to precision electroweak ( ew ) data ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a review ) .    despite having a branching ratio ( br ) that is only at the permille level ,",
    "the di - photon signature is preferred to the one associated with the main higgs decay channel in the above mass region , i.e. , higgs  @xmath6 ( into pair of @xmath7-quark jets , with br practically one ) , as the latter is swamped by the huge qcd background typical of a hadronic machine , whereas the former is much cleaner in such an environment .",
    "besides , the higher precision that one can achieve in determining both directions and energies of the photons ( as compared to those of jets ) , allows one to obtain a higgs mass resolution of the order 23 gev , which compares rather well to a typical 1520 gev accuracy from jet events , also recalling that the higgs width is at most a few tens of mev in the above mass region ( so that , the worse the mass resolution the larger the background , while the signal size remains relatively stable ) @xcite .",
    "the di - photon signature may also represent a distinctive signature of broken supersymmetry ( susy ) , namely , in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the so - called gravitino , @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the next - to - lsps ( nlsps ) are usually the lightest neutralino , @xmath9 , or the lighter stau , @xmath10 , depending upon the actual configuration of the gmsb model . in the first case then , the following decay chain could well occur : higgs  @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , where the missing ( transverse ) energy is due to the two lsps and possibly neutrinos ( from @xmath13 ) escaping detection ) of heavy higgs bosons also from non - gmsb scenarios in which the lsp is the lightest neutralino , @xmath14 , such as in ( minimal ) supergravity ( msugra ) models .",
    "in fact , the following decay chain can occur here : @xmath15 followed by a double radiative decay @xmath16",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this channel can be large if @xmath17 ( see below for its definition ) is small ( @xmath18 ) , with or without gaugino mass unification at high scales .",
    "however , this mssm configuration is ruled out by the lep2 limit on the lighter chargino mass @xcite . only under the assumption of non - universal gaugino masses",
    "can the br@xmath19 be large at high @xmath17 in msugra models @xcite . ] .",
    "current collider limits however forbid the lightest mssm higgs boson , @xmath20 , to decay into two neutralinos , i.e. , @xmath21 ( @xmath12 ) , so that only the two heavier neutral higgs bosons , @xmath22 , can initiate the above susy decay chain . recalling that @xmath23 direct decays can still occur in gmsb models ,",
    "it is intriguing to consider the possibility that _ all _ neutral higgs bosons of the mssm can be detected in the same channel , that is , a pair of photons accompanied by some amount of missing ( transverse ) energy , @xmath24 .",
    "notice that the latter should in average be larger for signal events as compared to the background , which is dominated by prompt di - photon production , where @xmath24 is mainly due to jet energy losses down the beam pipe or to non - fully hermetic detectors .",
    "in contrast , one would naturally expect a large @xmath24 value arising from the above @xmath25 and @xmath26 decays ( if not from invisible decay products of heavy particles produced in association with any of the higgs states , see below ) , so that the missing ( transverse ) energy may be used in the kinematical selection . in practice",
    "though , only two resonances could in the end be visible , as the @xmath25 and @xmath26 bosons are almost degenerate in mass . besides",
    ", the latter would tend to be located at higher @xmath0 invariant masses as compared to the one due to @xmath23 decays , where the production cross section is smaller , but so is the di - photon continuum .    finally , whereas the @xmath23 resonance can directly be reconstructed from the photon four - momenta ,",
    "the same is not true in the @xmath27 ( @xmath12 ) channel . here",
    ", however , after ensuring that the two photons are not back - to - back , one can attempt to resolve the @xmath24 along their directions and add it to the photonic transverse momenta , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "scaling up the respective sums by the ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 gives in principle the reconstructed momenta of the neutralino pair . in practice",
    "though , the presence of several unresolved sources of missing ( transverse ) energy may spoil the mass reconstruction .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate in detail such a phenomenology , in the context of gmsb scenarios . after a brief discussion of the parameters defining gmsb models and a description of the tools used in order to carry out our numerical studies",
    ", we will present the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "in gmsb models , the symmetry of the superpotential is broken at some relatively low scale , say , a few hundred tev ( the ` hidden sector ' ) , and susy - breaking is communicated to the detectable particles ( the ` visible sector ' ) through so - called ` messenger ' fields , effectively , gauge bosons .    in fact ,",
    "renormalisability of the theory , coupled with economy of field content , dictates that the messenger sector ( ms ) be comprised of chiral superfields such that their sm gauge couplings are vectorial in nature .",
    "most gmsb models actually consider these fields to be in ( @xmath32 ) or ( @xmath33 ) representations of su(5 ) .",
    "they are also chosen to transform as a multiplet of a grand unification theory ( gut ) , so that the susy prediction of gauge coupling unification is preserved .",
    "these facts restrict the maximum number of messenger families @xmath34 to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath37 constructs , respectively . limiting ourselves ,",
    "for the time being , to a single pair of ms supermultiplets ( @xmath38 ) , consider a term in the superpotential of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a sm singlet .",
    "the scalar ( @xmath41 ) and auxiliary ( @xmath42 ) components of @xmath40 may acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) through their interactions with the hidden sector fields .",
    "susy - breaking is thus communicated to the ms , with the fermions and sfermions acquiring different masses .",
    "this , in turn , is communicated to the sm fields resulting in the gauginos and sfermions acquiring masses at the one - loop and two - loop levels , respectively .",
    "the expressions , in the general case of multiple messenger pairs and/or gauge singlets @xmath43 , is a somewhat complicated function @xcite of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , if there is just one such singlet , the expressions for soft susy - breaking gaugino and scalar masses at the messenger scale @xmath46 simplify to : _",
    "i(m ) & = & n_m g_1 ( ) , + m^2_f(m ) & = & 2 n_m ^2 g_2 ( ) ^3_i=1_i c^f_i ( ) ^2 .",
    "[ threshold ] in eq .",
    "( [ threshold ] ) , @xmath47 are the quadratic casimirs for the sfermion in question .",
    "the factors @xmath48 equal 1 , 1 and @xmath49 for su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) , respectively , with the gauge couplings so normalised that all @xmath50 s are equal at the messenger scale .",
    "the threshold functions are given by g_1(x ) & = & ( 1+x)+ ( x -x ) , + g_2(x ) & = & + ( x -x ) .",
    "the superparticle masses at the ew scale are obtained from those in eqs .",
    "( 1)([threshold ] ) by evolving the appropriate renormalisation group equations ( rges ) . for the scalar masses ,",
    "the @xmath51-terms need to be added too .",
    "the higgs sector of the ` minimal ' gmsb model contains the two usual higgs doublets of the mssm , @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio of the vevs of the latter is parameterised as @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in the superpotential one has a higgs bilinear term of the form @xmath54 . in general ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 depend on the details of the susy - breaking mechanism .",
    "however , if we assume that the ew symmetry is broken radiatively , then the values of @xmath57 and @xmath56 are determined in terms of the other parameters of the model . without loss of generality",
    ", one may express the entire particle spectrum of such a gmsb model in terms of five external inputs only : @xmath58 , sgn@xmath59 and @xmath34 ( hereafter , we assume @xmath60 ) .",
    "as a starting point of our investigation , we shall discuss the relevant particle spectrum by searching for regions of the gmsb parameter space where the heavy higgs bosons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the lightest neutralino , @xmath9 , have masses and compositions ( in terms of the gaugino - higgsino fields ) such that the decays @xmath61 are kinematically allowed and reach brs that are at least comparable to that of the sm higgs decay into two photons , for which one has br@xmath62 .",
    "in fact , such a channel is of extreme importance in the mssm too , as already noted . here ,",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath63 define entirely the higgs sector of the mssm at tree - level , @xmath17 having being already defined and with @xmath63 being the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs state @xmath26 ( the other two states , @xmath20 and @xmath25 , are scalars ) .",
    "it turns out that , for any @xmath17 value , if @xmath64200 gev , the @xmath23 decay mode is a discovery channel of the lightest higgs boson of the mssm .    in order to sample the strength of the di - photon signal of our interest",
    ", we present a set of numerical results that include the higgs and lightest neutralino masses , as well as the brs of the channels @xmath65 . in computing these rates",
    "we have used the subroutines of isajet 7.58 @xcite that implement the gmsb model , with several choices of parameter inputs .",
    "namely , in tabs . 1,2 and 3 we have fixed @xmath66 tev and taken @xmath67 and @xmath68 tev , respectively .",
    "here , the sign of @xmath55 is always negative whereas @xmath17 varies from 5 up to a maximum value where the decays @xmath65 are no longer kinematically allowed .    from tabs .",
    "13 one can appreciate the following trends .    *",
    "as intimated in the introduction , the higgs masses @xmath69 and @xmath63 show a degeneracy within a couple of gevs .",
    "thus , we can add their corresponding two - photon signals , as it would not be possible to distinguish among them solely on the basis of the reconstructed mass .",
    "* the lightest neutralino @xmath70 decays into a photon plus a gravitino , @xmath71 , while br@xmath72 can exceed the @xmath73 level , this yielding altogether a decay rate for the channels @xmath74 above our reference di - photon sm higgs decay rate . * for values of @xmath17 larger than 40 or so , the decays @xmath75 are no longer kinematically allowed .",
    "table  1 : higgs , lightest neutralino masses and br@xmath76 for a sample set of gmsb inputs with @xmath77 tev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the signature we are trying to extract is simply defined as follows , along the lines of the atlas / cms triggers @xcite .    *",
    "two photons are required : one with @xmath78 gev and 20 gev for the other , both within 2.5 in pseudorapidity . *",
    "the two photons are required to have a relative angle less than 175 degrees , in order to enable the mass reconstruction of the two heaviest higgs bosons decaying into two photons and two lsps , the latter yielding the missing ( transverse ) energy . * no cuts in missing (",
    "transverse ) energy are enforced at this preliminary stage , nor any restriction on the underlying hadronic activity is imposed .",
    "we then look at :    * @xmath79 : the missing ( transverse ) energy .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "2(a , b , c ) , normalised to one .",
    "( hereafter , the labelling a(b)[c ] in the figures refers to gmsb set 1(2)[3 ] as given above in tab .",
    "as intimated in the introduction , one may appreciate here the fact that the missing ( transverse ) energy distribution is much softer for the background , as compared to the signal .",
    "a suitable cut on this quantity , which will enhance the signal - to - background ratio , could be , e.g. , @xmath80 gev .",
    "this may penalise signal contributions due to @xmath20 decays , yet it will have a beneficial impact in extracting those arising from @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    upon enforcing this constraint , in addition to the cuts in 1.2 .",
    ", we look at two kinematic observables :    * @xmath81 : the invariant mass of the photon pair obtained by using their visible momenta ; * @xmath82 : the invariant mass of the photon pair obtained after resolving the @xmath79 along the visible photon directions .    these are plotted in figs .",
    "3(a , b , c ) and 4(a , b , c ) , respectively , normalised to the integrated cross section in picobarns , as given by herwig .",
    "from these plots it is clear the potential of the lhc in detecting di - photon signals of neutral higgs bosons , as induced by our sample of gmsb model configurations .",
    "however , while the direct @xmath23 resonance is clearly visible and narrowly centred around @xmath83 in both distributions @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( and so it was even prior to the enforcement of the cut in @xmath79 ) , no peak associated to @xmath84 decays appears , yet the corresponding events spread over the entire mass range well above the di - photon background .",
    "in fact , our mass reconstruction procedure fails because of the many unresolvable sources of missing energy appearing at hadron level , once all decay modes of each unstable particle are allowed , as dictated by the mssm configuration induced by the underlying gmsb scenario . here",
    ", the exploitation of a more exclusive final state would be helpful to the cause of extracting the @xmath85 resonance .",
    "however , we refrain here from pursuing this matter further and simply remark that , even in absence of heavy higgs mass reconstruction , a clear excess in the di - photon channel above the sm expectations should be established at the lhc after minimal luminosity with the final state light ( anti)quark mistagged as a photon , not included here , is also small in comparison .",
    "] , with some dependence in both the @xmath81 and @xmath82 spectra upon the relevant masses @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , whose actual values may be investigated via a comparison of the data to the mc generated distributions .",
    "in summary , we have proved that , for some rather natural configurations of the gmsb parameter space consistent with current collider limits , one may be able to extract di - photon signals of all neutral higgs bosons of the mssm at the lhc . while , after customary atlas / cms cuts on the two photons , the mass of the lightest state would always be visible in the form of a @xmath0 resonance , the presence of the two heaviest states ( which are degenerate in mass ) can be established , in the form of a clear excess in the total number of @xmath89 events over the corresponding sm predictions , after an additional threshold in missing ( transverse ) energy is enforced .",
    "thus , after such a selection , in order to test very specific gmsb model predictions , it suffices to exploit the total event rate .",
    "finally , the study of the kinematics of the entire event sample may allow for the determination of crucial sparticle masses , such as those of the the lsp and nlsp , hence enabling one to strongly constrain the underlying susy - breaking mechanism .",
    "our conclusions are based on a sophisticated mc event simulation but a more rudimentary emulation of detector response ( based on gaussian smearing of the visible tracks ) .",
    "however , our preliminary results are rather encouraging and we do believe that they call for attention on the atlas / cms side , as the @xmath0 channel is possibly the most studied one in the context of higgs boson searches at the upcoming cern hadron collider .",
