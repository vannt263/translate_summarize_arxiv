    "there have been several attempts to derive the granular contact force probability density function ( pdf ) for static granular packings , @xmath2 , by using analogies from thermal statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the interest arises in part because the empirical @xmath2 @xcite has an exponential tail , reminiscent of the energy distributions of thermal systems .",
    "however , the overall form of @xmath2 is not found in thermal systems , generally having a peak or plateau near the average force and a non - zero value at zero force as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : vectorpdf ] ) .",
    "in contrast to this form , the prototypical distributions found in thermal systems are either monotonically decreasing ( e.g. , the gibbs energy distribution ) , or begin from zero probability density at the origin before rising to a peak ( e.g. , the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ) . in the non - monotonic cases the rising slope is due to the degeneracy of energy states .",
    "the degeneracies reflect the dimensionality of the system and dominate the form of the distribution at weak energies beginning from the origin . since the forces in a granular medium are vector magnitudes composed from several cartesian components  implying degeneracy in the force magnitudes  this raises the question why @xmath2 does not likewise begin from the origin @xmath3 before rising to its peak ?",
    "indeed , a recent model @xcite predicts that it should .",
    "the model represents a first - principles approximation for key elements of the physics and results in a boltzmann - type equation that is solvable .",
    "this produces a @xmath4 that begins from @xmath5 , rises to a peak , and then decays exponentially .",
    "because of these considerations , the question may be asked whether the empirical observations that @xmath6 is primarily the result of numerical or experimental uncertainties : the distribution is in question precisely where the forces are weakest and therefore most difficult to model or measure .",
    "perhaps the theory provides a clearer view into the fundamental organization of the density of states ( dos ) in this region than the empirical methods are presently able to provide .",
    "it seems to the author that this is not the case for two reasons .",
    "first , it has been shown that the form in the region of weak forces evolves in a predictable way as a function of stress and/or fabric anisotropy , which may be induced through shearing @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy dependence probably explains the variations in @xmath4 seen among the different empirical studies , in that some jammed packings have displayed peaks while others have displayed plateaus or monotonic forms . for a packing of grains originally in an isotropic state , @xmath2 displays a form similar to fig .",
    "( [ fig : vectorpdf ] ) .",
    "as the packing is quasi - statically sheared the distribution smoothly evolves to having a plateau in the region of weak forces and then on to becoming a monotonically decreasing function with only an abrupt change of slope where the peak had previously been .",
    "after the packing achieves peak shear strength , continued shearing reduces the stress anisotropy and causes the distribution to retrace its evolution most of the way , ending with a small peak again .",
    "this behavior affects the distribution well above the region of numerical uncertainty and can not be dismissed as the result of dynamical or transient forces since the shearing is quasi - static .",
    "it is difficult to see how this smooth variation of forms  including plateaus and monotonic forms  could be explained if the finite @xmath7 were not real .",
    "second , the unique features of the pdf have been obtained using a wide range of empirical techniques , and it does not seem reasonable that all of them are incorrect in the region of weak forces .",
    "these techniques include experiments with frictional grains @xcite , numerical simulations with frictional grains @xcite or purely frictionless grains @xcite , and adaptive network models @xcite .",
    "the simulation techniques have included contact dynamics ( cd ) , discrete element modeling ( dem ) , and molecular dynamics ( md ) quenched beneath the glass transition @xcite , all of which are well - established techniques .",
    "the contact laws in these simulations have included hertzian , hookean , and lennard jones potentials .",
    "simulations have been done with and without gravity and under a wide variety of conditions .",
    "the transitions between the boundary and bulk have been thoroughly examined @xcite .",
    "the numerical techniques have demonstrated the ability to distinguish between distributions that begin at the origin and those that do not @xcite .",
    "although experiments with frictionless emulsions @xcite and some numerical simulations @xcite have been fitted to forms that begin with @xmath3 , arguably those data would be fit as well or better by forms with nonzero @xmath8 .",
    "the universality of these observations shows that the pdf s unique features are not associated with a specific type of model or the ( non)existence of friction , but are fundamental characteristics of static granular packings . because of this",
    ", the present paper will proceed with the assumption that these observations are correct but have yet to be explained .",
    "perhaps the explanation lies in a unique generalization of statistical mechanics . just as the dos for ideal bose and fermi gases",
    "are organized differently than the classical dilute gas and therefore produce their own unique energy distributions , so the dos of granular packings may be organized in some unique way to produce this distinctive pdf .",
    "such a generalization has been taking shape @xcite , beginning with edwards hypothesis @xcite that all metastable packings are equally probable in the statistical ensemble .",
    "another line of progress is based on the concept of directed force chain networks @xcite , while others aim to understand the distribution of forces beneath a localized perturbation or more generally the stress response function @xcite , and the phenomena related to jamming and unjamming @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses more narrowly upon those models or hypotheses which predict a pdf by making assumptions about the dos in the ensemble , including those models which take a random walk in a phase space ( e.g. , the @xmath9 model ) or a pdf space ( i.e. , the boltzmann transport equation variety ) , and those which directly assume the form of an entropy or other thermodynamic functional .",
    "the @xmath9 model @xcite may be considered a random walk because the set of forces in a single layer of the lattice describe a locus in phase space while the random redistribution of those forces from one layer to the next ( controlled by the stochastic @xmath9 variables ) represents a random walk through that space .",
    "eventually the walk wanders into regions of the space having the most probable distribution of coordinates .",
    "bouchaud has shown that the sufficient requirement to obtain the exponential tail in the @xmath9 model is simply that some grains transmit all their load from one hemisphere into just one contact on the other hemisphere @xcite .",
    "this introduced a new way to think about granular media : the statistical relaxation of the force distribution does not occur dynamically through the time dimension as it does in thermal systems ; rather it is a necessary feature of the _ internal _ , layer - by - layer static equilibrium relationships , where the spatial dimensions play a role analogous to the time dimension for the corresponding set of cartesian components of force @xcite .",
    "several generalizations of the @xmath9 model and other lattice - based models have been developed @xcite .",
    "some of these are similarly random walks in a non - dynamic phase space , but others include explicitly dynamic features to recursively achieve organization in the percolating force network .    in this context",
    "it is probably helpful to mention again @xcite that the distribution predicted by the @xmath9 model @xcite was not @xmath4 , but rather @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total vertical load supported by the grain .",
    "distributions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been occasionally confused with one another , especially since @xmath11 and @xmath12 become identical in the special case at the flat sides of a container .",
    "this has contributed to the confusion over the form of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath9 model can also produce distributions @xmath13 of the vertical cartesian components of the contact forces , @xmath14 , but it can not directly predict the vector magnitudes @xmath12 of those same contact forces .",
    "the @xmath13 predicted by the @xmath9 model is always monotonically decreasing , in agreement with numerical simulation data @xcite .",
    "another theoretical model that makes direct statements about the contact force dos is the boltzmann - type equation presented by edwards and grinev @xcite mentioned above . in the discussion section , this paper shall attempt to reconcile the model with the empirical data .",
    "other models include several entropy maximization or functional minimization concepts .",
    "these methods produce elements of the empirically - observed pdfs , but not all of their features .",
    "the concept proposed by bagi @xcite deals , like the @xmath9 model , with cartesian components .",
    "it produces the same canonical distribution as the uniform @xmath9 model .",
    "the concept proposed by kruyt and rothenburg @xcite deals with contact force magnitudes and predicts @xmath15 , a peak , and an exponential tail .",
    "the concept proposed by ngan @xcite produces @xmath16 , a peak , and a nearly - gaussian , compressed - exponential tail . unlike edwards and",
    "grinev s model , these last three are not derived from first - principles but are hypotheses drawn by analogy with other entropic systems .",
    "despite any shortcomings , all these models provide important insights into the nature of the pdf problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "ii will present a first - principles analysis of the dos in a modified version of the edwards ensemble @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of granular media will be completely avoided so that edwards hypothesis alone shapes the dos .",
    "it will be shown that the dos is highly self - organized and very sparse .",
    "its form depends upon the form of @xmath2 and _ vice versa _ so that recursion is necessary to solve for either .",
    "maximizing a state counting entropy in this phase space will produce the recursion equation which is analogous to the boltzmann transport equation . to elucidate the organization of the dos",
    ", it will be projected in the mean structure approximation across all angular coordinates before solving numerically .",
    "iii presents the numerical solution of the mean structure transport equation .",
    "the results demonstrate the success of edwards hypothesis in that it predicts a form for the pdfs in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental and simulation data , having @xmath16 , a peak , and an exponential tail with a decay constant matching empirical observations .",
    "iv discusses the validity of the approach and insights into the physics that produce the features of @xmath2 .",
    "v summarizes the paper and points to several unanswered problems and generalizations that are needed .",
    "following edwards and coworkers , this analysis focuses upon 2d , amorphous packings of cohesionless , rigid grains having the fixed coordination number that makes the packing isostatic @xcite .",
    "the problem shall be further idealized , however , by using only smooth , round grains . also , this paper focuses on the frictionless case wherein the 2d isostatic coordination number is @xmath17 .",
    "a method has been found to solve edwards probability functional for this special case .",
    "although this ensemble is highly idealized , it is a good starting point because 2d packings of cohesionless , round grains that are perfectly rigid @xcite and/or frictionless @xcite are known to have force distributions with the same qualitative features as the more generalized packings and hence must be subject to the same organizational constraints in the statistics .",
    "therefore they are sufficient to elucidate the origin of those constraints in the physics .",
    "the use of exactly four contacts per grain , however , is more idealized than has been achieved in typical numerical simulations . nevertheless , it is acceptable because that is the average coordination number for 2d frictionless packings of round , rigid grains which are isostatic @xcite , and it will be shown herein that the same qualitative and quantitative features of @xmath2 arise as they do in the more realistic simulations",
    ".    two defining issues for the ensemble are ( 1 ) how to specify the fabric , and ( 2 ) how to apply stress to it .",
    "since this paper is concerned primarily with the derivation of @xmath2 , and since its form is known to evolve with stress and fabric anisotropy under shearing , the ensemble will sufficiently general to accommodate anisotropy in each . on the other hand",
    ", this paper does not address the more ambitious problem of stress propagation .",
    "therefore the analysis shall not accommodate large - scale stress and fabric inhomogeneities that persist in the ensemble average .",
    "an example of an inhomogeneous case is the conical sandpile formed by central pouring , which has directional fabric and stress propagation away from the center of the pile @xcite . in this paper",
    ", only actions such as shaking , shearing and compressing are assumed to have occurred in the construction history because these produce homogeneous stress and fabric states with only statistical fluctuations , vanishing in the ensemble average .",
    "specifically , stress will be specified as the tensor which is a volume average over the entire packing .",
    "the source of stress will be mechanical at the boundaries to allow for the full range of possible states , something which gravity alone can not do .",
    "gravity will be eliminated both because it is not necessary and because it breaks a symmetry of the ensemble and may thus tend to obscure the organizational features of the physics .",
    "this leaves the question how to specify the fabric .",
    "edwards and coworkers have developed a conjugate field theory with the goal of explaining the propagation of stresses in granular materials correlated to the local contact geometry @xcite . in that theory it has been shown that two fabric tensors are required to produce the complete set of stress propogation equations .",
    "they have elsewhere developed a thermodynamic theory of compaction , in which the relevant specifier is simply the scalar volume of the packing @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the choice was made there to avoid the full anisotropic treatment .",
    "for the present purposes , something is needed which is less than the full tensorial treatment but more than scalar compaction .",
    "we will therefore use the joint probability density function ( jpdf ) @xmath18 studied in ref .",
    "this function correlates the contact angles that share the same grain .",
    "it can be collapsed to @xmath19 , @xmath20 the use of the uncollapsed distribution is deemed necessary because the physics of fragile media are grain - centered and the intra - grain correlations turn out to be the heart of the statistical physics , as shall be shown here .",
    "this jpdf is not sufficient to relate the packing state to the specified stress tensor , however , because it tells nothing of the number and size of voids created by the arrangement of neighboring grain configurations . for the present",
    ", the voids may be quantified simply by assuming a number of grains per unit distance in a cross - section of the 2d packing in each orthogonal direction .",
    "these quantities along with the jpdf will be specified in the ensemble rather than predicted .",
    "evolution of the internal state of the packing is beyond the present study .    finally , for convenience",
    "the idea of `` quartered fabric '' is introduced at several points .",
    "it is defined such that @xmath18 is zero everywhere except where the @xmath21 contact is on the @xmath21 quadrant of every grain in the packing . for the specific case of `` quartered isotropy , '' collapsing the quartered fabric by eq .",
    "( [ collapse ] ) produces @xmath22 .",
    "this mimics true isotropy but the anisotropic quartering is apparent in the jpdf . as in the case of non - quartered fabric , @xmath23 enforces steric exclusion . to achieve quartered isotropy with steric exclusion in a monte carlo process",
    "it is necessary to weight the distribution of attempted angles to emphasize the regions close to the edges of each quadrant . otherwise , steric exclusion would cause notches to appear in @xmath19 near the boundary of each quadrant .",
    "the use of quartered fabric in this analysis is only to provide insight into the expressions .",
    "it is always possible to write and numerically solve them for the more general case , and it was found that numerical solutions were indistinguishable with or without quartered fabric .",
    "the locus in phase space of a classical dilute monatomic gas completely defines its state .",
    "we wish to define a phase space for granular packings which is similarly complete .",
    "a 2d frictionless granular packing of @xmath24 round , rigid grains is isostatic and therefore contains @xmath25 contacts .",
    "the phase space therefore requires at least @xmath26 phase space axes , half of which define the force on each contact and half of which define the contact angles , @xmath27 , which is labeled @xmath28 and has dos @xmath29 .",
    "it is possible to define the ordering of the axes so that it is understood which four contacts correspond to the same grain and therefore which grains contact one another .",
    "it will not prove necessary to do so explicitly , although this ordering is implicitly assumed to exist .",
    "newton s third law ( n3l ) is automatically satisfied in @xmath28 , since each contact is represented by only one force and one angle axis .",
    "however , enforcing newton s second law ( n2l ) will prove simpler if redundant axes are created to account for each contact force twice , one time with each grain that shares the contact , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 subscripts the grain and @xmath32 subscripts the contact on the grain .",
    "this space is labeled @xmath33 . in this new space",
    "it will be necessary to enforce n3l .",
    "again , it is possible to define the ordering of the axes so that it is understood which contacts are redundant to one another and therefore which grains are contacting neighbors",
    ". it will not be necessary to do so explicitly , although this ordering is implicitly assumed to exist .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath34 this ensemble has edwards flat measure , every metastable state being equally probable , the dos in @xmath33 is , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the heaviside ( unit step ) function .",
    "the six constraints which define the accessible regions of phase space are described below .",
    "the jpdf for the fabric is specified by the first delta function .",
    "actually , there should be a statement relating the continuum @xmath37 with the discretized distribution of angles at finite @xmath24 , @xmath38 , but the meaning is nonetheless clear",
    "( and 3 . ) the cartesian loads @xmath39 and @xmath40 on each grain will often be called the `` supported loads '' or simply the `` loads '' . at each locus in phase space",
    "the relationship exists between these loads and the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for simplicity the sum over these cartesian loads is specified .",
    "hence , @xmath41 where the loads are defined by , @xmath42 and , using non - quartered fabric , @xmath43 the operator @xmath44 multiplies the expression by 1 if @xmath45 meaning the @xmath46 contact is on the left half of the grain , else it multiplies it by 0 .",
    "likewise @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 test for contacts on the right , top and bottom side of the grain , respectively .",
    "for stable grains , @xmath50 , but the hemispheric distinctions shall be useful in the analysis .",
    "n3l is satisfied between every pair of contacting grains . @xmath51 where grains @xmath52 and @xmath53 are contacting neighbors through their @xmath54 and @xmath55 contacts , respectively .",
    "n2l for static equilibrium must be satisfied at each grain individually , @xmath56    \\6 .",
    "@xmath36 enforces no tensile contacts anywhere in the packing , which restricts the dos to the first `` quadrant '' of the force axes .",
    "in addition to these six constraints , two missing constraints should be noted :    \\1 .",
    "the above ensemble does not enforce the shear stress but relies on the fact that their ensemble average is zero and in the thermodynamic limit the fraction of packings in which the shear deviates from zero by more than some arbitrarily small amount will vanish .",
    "the cartesian axes of the packings are taken to be aligned with the principle stress axes so that the off - diagonal elements of the stress tensor should be zero .",
    "a cluster of real grains must just touch one another , forming closed loops , but in the above ensemble the geometric constraints for grains outside the first coordination shell have been intentionally omitted .",
    "this _ first shell approximation _",
    "( fsa ) asserts that only negligible correlative information travels all the way around closed loops of grains in the ensemble average . in other words ,",
    "the dos is adequately characterized for the present purposes by the two - point ( intra - grain ) force correlations and the resulting correlation of loads in neighboring grains .",
    "therefore , the geometric closure of force loops can be ignored when deriving the statistics of single - grain states .",
    "there are important arguments supporting the fsa and they will be presented in the discussion section .",
    "although edwards flat measure is uniform across the regions of accessible phase space , the volume of those regions is not uniformly distributed across the coordinates .",
    "the program is to change coordinates in a way that eliminates delta function constraints from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dos2 ] ) , trading the lack of uniformity in the constraints for a lack of flatness in the measure .",
    "when only extensive , conserved quantities remain in the list of constraints , then the method of the most probable distribution may be used , relying on the method of lagrange multipliers to conserve those quantities .      in this context",
    "the term `` grain configuration '' refers not only to a grain s contact geometry but also to the set of forces upon those contacts as defined by the locus in phase space .",
    "the form of @xmath33 itself does not require neighboring grains to satisfy n3l , and so the vast majority of loci include neighboring grain configurations with physically unrealizable forces .",
    "this mathematical abstraction enables the analysis .",
    "if we wished to neglect n3l then we could proceed with the remainder of the analysis , obtaining the hypothetical dos for regions of this space having stable , cohesionless grains , write the state - counting entropy and then maximize it subject to the conservation of total loads and fabric .",
    "this would produce the most probable distribution for all possible permutations of @xmath24 stable grain configurations where the grains are mechanically _",
    "independent_. however , it turns out that n3l is not negligible : by considering instead all the possible _ combinations _ ( rather than all possible _ permutations _ ) of @xmath24 stable , independent grain configurations , we note that some of these combinations can be mechanically connected into a greater number permutations satisfying n3l than can other combinations .",
    "hence , those combinations are the more entropic ones , the ones which represent the greater number of metastable packings in the phase space",
    ". therefore , to find the most entropic combination of stable , independent grain configurations , we will map @xmath57 , a space where the axes are the same as in @xmath33 except that they are not sequenced to represent a particular permutation of the grains . whereas a locus in @xmath33 represents a single state ( a single packing permutation of a set of grain configurations ) , a locus in @xmath58 represents a set of mechanically disconnected grain configurations that may or may not be permutable into some number of stable states .",
    "we shall call the latter an `` assembly space '' to distinguish it from a phase space that identifies every grain s location in the packing .",
    "the fraction of permutations that satisfy n3l will be quantified in this mapping process .    to verify that a particular permutation of a given combination of stable grains @xmath59 satisfies n3l",
    ", it is necessary to check every contact in the permutation .",
    "all permutations of this combination have the same jpdf of forces and contact angles , @xmath60 , whatever its form may be . randomly choosing one contact from the set of these permutations , a contact force @xmath61 at angle",
    "@xmath62 therefore has the probability @xmath63 that it will satisfy n3l with its neighbor .",
    "( the two differentials reflect the fact that n3l reduces the solution space by two dimensions per contact , thereby taking out the extra dimensions introduced in @xmath64 . ) the probability that an entire grain configuration drawn from this set of permutations will satisfy n3l with its four neighbors will be called @xmath65 , written for compactness as @xmath66 .",
    "it may be written as a functional of @xmath67 , @xmath68 this expression treats the contacts on the neighboring grains as if they are uncorrelated because this is a packing that was drawn randomly from the set of all possible permutations , including the ones which are physically unrealizable .",
    "therefore there are no _ a priori _ correlations between neighboring grains ; such correlations arise _ a posteriori _ by selecting the subset of packings that satisfy n3l .    because of this statistical independence",
    ", the fraction of packings that satisfy n3l for all of its grains is likewise simply the product over the probabilities that each of the individual grains will satisfy n3l with its own local neighbors .",
    "( the fsa appears implicitly in this statement .",
    ") however , the product of @xmath69 over all @xmath31 accounts for every contact in the packing twice , once with each grain sharing the contact . for the cases where n3l is in fact satisfied , the double accounting of contacts will appear as pairs of @xmath67 factors having identical arguments .",
    "hence , the probability that the entire packing will satisfy n3l is the square root of that product  explaining the use of the square exponent in eq .",
    "( [ ups1 ] ) .",
    "the fraction of permutations that satisfy n3l is , @xmath70 this calculation does not handle the boundaries of the packing ( unless they are periodic ) , but we are concerned with the statistics in the bulk in the thermodynamic limit where the boundaries are pushed out toward infinity .",
    "now the dos may be mapped from the phase space to the assembly space , @xmath57 , @xmath71 the tilde on @xmath72 indicates that this density is in an assembly space .      to quantify the effects of n2l , note that eq .",
    "( [ wmapping ] ) can be used as a many - to - one mapping from @xmath73 , which will have coordinates @xmath74 and is another assembly space , representing combinations of mechanically - independent grain configurations .",
    "thus , the mapping reduces the dimensionality of the space by two per grain , just as n2l reduces the dimensionality of the solution space by two per grain .",
    "however , the reverse mapping is one - to - one because the localized isostacy of the grains determines the four contact forces when the supported loads and four contact angles are specified .",

    "the two approximations which enabled this ensemble analysis are the first shell approximation ( fsa ) and the mean structure approximation ( msa ) .",
    "ultimately , the quantitative validation of these requires a careful comparison with numerical simulation data for particular states of the stress , fabric , and rheological history , and this has not yet been performed .",
    "meanwhile , the qualitative validity is already evident as discussed below .      beside the constraints which defined the ensemble",

    "( [ dos2 ] ) , another geometric constraint is needed to ensure closure of every `` loop '' of grains in a packing . without this closure",
    ", the chains of contacting grains are allowed to branch out ever increasingly in all directions and overlap into one another s space .",
    "geometrically , then , omitting this constraint does not produce a good approximation to a packing",
    ". however , it may still be an excellent approximation as far as the statistics of single - grain states are concerned .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that contact forces on the same grain are strongly correlated with one another .",
    "there is anti - correlation for contacts closer together than @xmath273 radians of angular separation , and a positive correlation when the angular separation is greater than that .",
    "the correlation continues to increase as the contacts are increasingly distant from one another but still on the same grain .",
    "the correlation dramatically drops immediately thereafter when the distance between contacts becomes greater than one grain diameter .",
    "the strong intra - grain relationships make sense due to the requirements of static equilibrium of the individual grains .",
    "contacts on the same quadrant compete for a share of the same load and hence are anti - correlated .",
    "contacts opposite one another transmit load through one another and hence are correlated .",
    "simplistically we could expect @xmath274 to be the crossover point of no correlation as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ quadpacks ] ) .",
    "contacts that are approximately @xmath213 radians away from one another on the same grain are only weakly correlated as illustrated by the closed loop of four grains that allows any combination of weak and strong force chains to pass through it .",
    "if the angles were precisely @xmath213 , then the four force chains in this figure would be completely independent.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    this is approximately correct , and the error is probably attributable to the existence of three - grain loops , history - dependent frictional effects , and so on .    likewise , the sudden drop in correlation after one grain diameter of separation is also understandable in terms of the local mechanics .",
    "it is true that neighboring grains share a common contact so that contacts on adjacent grains are just two sequential two - point correlations away from one another .",
    "this induces correlations between them .",
    "however , these inter - grain correlations should be primarily the result of the information contained in the sequential two - point intra - grain correlations because the lack of cohesion makes the grains otherwise ( largely ) independent .",
    "additional constraints are not found in the packing until entirely closed loops of grains are considered so that the sequential two - point correlations come all the way around the loop back to the original grain , again . in 2d",
    "the typical closed loop consists of four grains , each grain being a vertex between a pair of contacts that form the loop .",
    "the four - point correlation constructed as three sequential two - point correlations going the long way around a loop would undoubtedly be very weak compared to the single two - point correlation going the short way around the same loop , since the short way is intra - grain .",
    "hence , the extra correlation information imposed going the long - way around the loop must be very weak compared to the information already present intra - grain .",
    "it should therefore be an excellent approximation to neglect this additional information and consider only the intra - grain relationships in defining the dos .",
    "this is the essence of the fsa .",
    "this is not a rigorous argument because we should consider the sum of information from _ all _ the loops in the packing that contain the grain in question , and it is conceivable that the sum of very many weak contributions may be strong .",
    "however , due to the randomness of the packing , and the large number of amorphous packings that may exist in the configuration space , it is expected that the contributions from increasingly larger loops of grains will be increasingly decoherent and largely cancel one another .",
    "hence , there is good reason to assume that only the intra - grain contribution to the correlations is significant in agreement with the fsa .",
    "if correct , the fsa is an important statement of the physics because it fundamentally characterizes the dos and provides deep insight into the organization of the physics .",
    "in contrast to thermal systems , with granular packings it would be completely unsatisfactory to use a mean - field approximation because this would throw away the structure resulting from the strong two - point correlations ( remembering that these have been observed empirically ) . however , by including only this next higher level in the approximation , that is , only the two - point correlations ( and assuming that higher correlations exist strictly as a sequence of two - point correlations ) the maximization of a state - counting entropy and the solution of the resulting transport equation produces excellent results as shown in the previous sec .",
    "the two - point correlations therefore appear to be the essence of the physics .",
    "further work is needed to carefully test this hypothesis .",
    "the msa is important because , if correct , it characterizes the structure factor as being a functional of @xmath153 rather than @xmath85 , and this offers the possibility to decouple the fabric from the force distributions in a way that will help the development of a full theory of rheology . in the meantime , pending rigorous testing of the msa , the following three considerations are presented to help justify it .",

    "these latter considerations imply that the msa does characterize the organization in the dos qualitatively , but more effort is needed to show whether it is quantitatively sufficient .",

    "the results are statistically indistinguishable , lending credence to the mean structure approximation . ]",
    "this shows that the resulting distributions are insensitive to the existence or non - existence of correlations between the cartesian loads and the contact angles , and this is the essence of the msa .",
    "the features of a dos may be described by two components : the shape of the accessible regions of the phase space , and the measure that is used within that space .",
    "it is possible that the phase space is not equally accessed by the dynamics of a real packing as it locates and settles into one of the static states .",
    "perhaps this is more true for the hyperstatic ( frictional ) case or for other cases less idealized than the one considered here .",
    "the form of the pdfs would then be a reflection of the shape of the measure rather than the shape of the space .",
    "nevertheless , the use of edwards flat measure produced at least the _",
    "predominant _ features of @xmath2 , and so those features are attributable to the shape of the space .",
    "the surprising repeatability of @xmath2 seen experimentally and in simulations under many conditions and in many non - idealized cases is therefore explained by this fact .",
    "the rise in @xmath2 to a peak is not due to a degeneracy of @xmath12 states in the same way that thermal systems have a distribution shaped by the degeneracy of energy states or momentum magnitudes . in other words , if a granular contact force @xmath303 $ ] had three cartesian components that were statistically independent , then there would be a volume of phase space @xmath304 corresponding to each value of @xmath12 such that @xmath305 as @xmath306 .",
    "if that were the case , then the rise in @xmath2 would necessarily begin at the origin .",
    "however , since that is contrary to empirical observations , this sort of cartesian component degeneracy must not be a dominant feature in the dos despite the fact that @xmath12 is a vector magnitude .",
    "an explanation for this begins with the idea that the fundamental unit in a granular packing is not a contact force , but a grain , and so the physics of allowable grain states limits the space ( i.e. , there must be a grain factor ) . for the particular case considered in this paper",
    ", there must be six axes in the phase space of single grain states .",
    "the 2d stress tensor has two independent principle stress values , and so at least two of the six axes represent the force state .",
    "these may be @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( or @xmath174 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "the other four axes must convey the geometric information , so they may be contact angles .",
    "if the space were given more axes than this then the density of single grain states would be constrained onto a ( hyper)surface within that space , but we want the states to fill the volume so that we may examine the behavior of the volume in the limit that one contact force @xmath307 .",
    "a fixed value of @xmath308 defines a 5 dimensional region within the single grain space .",
    "its 5d volume is , @xmath309 where @xmath310\\theta(f_2)\\theta(f_3)\\theta(f_4)\\label{3domega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the volume of a 3d hypersurface .",
    "the integrand of this is everywhere nonnegative and for any load state @xmath311 there exist some angles @xmath190 such that the integrand is positive .",
    "this is because just three contacts @xmath312 , @xmath313 , and @xmath314 can support arbitrarily high loads by themselves regardless of the value of @xmath308 .",
    "therefore @xmath315 this fact is demonstrated in 2d frictionless numerical simulations where it is seen that a large fraction of the grains have coordination @xmath316 and yet support compressive loads in both axes , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . because of this , it turns out that in eq .",
    "( [ 5domega ] ) the integrals in @xmath11 diverge and @xmath103 is infinite for all values of @xmath308 .",
    "the conclusion is that stable grains with @xmath307 are not confined into a vanishing region of the phase space .",
    "this is in contrast to thermal systems where , for example , @xmath317 $ ] can be zero if and only if all its statistically independent components become zero so that @xmath318 as @xmath319 .",
    "there are two key distinctives of the granular phase space .",
    "first , while contact forces are indeed vectors , the stability requirement for the individual grains is so constraining that the components of the vectors can not be statistically independent .",
    "therefore , the dos can not be uniform in a space defined by the cartesian axes .",
    "the degeneracy of vector magnitudes does not automatically force @xmath320 to zero .",
    "second , even the magnitudes of the contact forces sharing the same grain can not be statistically independent .",
    "therefore , the dos can not be uniform in a space defined by all the force magnitude axes .",
    "the vanishing volume of the non - tensile quadrant near the origin does not automatically force @xmath320 to zero , either . instead forces sharing a grain are correlated in some regions of phase space and anti - correlated in other regions , depending upon the the @xmath190 axes .",
    "it is the existence of anticorrelation that provides the grains no fewer degrees of freedom at @xmath321 than they have at any other value of @xmath308 .",
    "this will be explained further , below .",
    "this observation about the phase space is the answer why @xmath7 .",
    "edwards flat measure predicts it , indicating that the vast majority of metastable packings contain a finite fraction of grains with one or more contacts arbitrarily close to zero force .",
    "in fact , we know this is correct because every time the stress state of a packing is perturbed there is a finite probability that a measurable fraction of the grains will tip and rearrange .",
    "if something in the physics had made the region near zero force to be a vanishing fraction of the accessible space , then a flat measure in the space would have made tipping and rearranging prohibitively improbable .",
    "since the volume of phase space does not vanish as @xmath306 , then what causes the slope in @xmath4 in the region of weak forces ?",
    "the answer is that even though @xmath322 is nonvanishing as @xmath307 , it does get somewhat smaller in that limit .",
    "this is because contacts on opposite hemispheres of the grain  say , @xmath308 and @xmath313are highly correlated .",
    "when @xmath323 , then @xmath324 over a larger region of @xmath190 than it is when @xmath325 .",
    "this was proven analytically for a special case in ref .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ 3domega ] assumes isotropy in the integrand .",
    "weighting the integrand anisotropically may provide sufficient generality to produce either rising or falling slopes in @xmath4 in the region of weak forces , and this may explain its evolution under slow shearing @xcite .    the reason the simplest model of edwards and grinev @xcite predicts @xmath3 is because it treats all the input forces and angle cosines @xmath326 as statistically independent .",
    "this implies a phase space @xmath327 with many more degrees of freedom than a static grain actually possesses .",
    "then , the non - negative domains of all the angle cosines ensure that every @xmath328 is positively correlated with @xmath12 , where @xmath329 . the only way that @xmath12 can be zero is for all @xmath330 quantities @xmath331 to be simultaneously zero , which is vanishingly improbable due to their statistical independence .",
    "this is in contrast to real grains where the neighboring contacts having less than @xmath213 radians of angular separation should be anti - correlated .",
    "that is , one contact can lift the load off of its neighboring contact so that if one contact bears more load then the neighbor must bear less .",
    "this anticorrelation allows the grain to be stable with @xmath332 while the other contacts have nonzero forces on them .",
    "that is , the grain finds more ways to be stable with zero force on one of its contacts than simply by having zero force on all of its other contacts . without addressing the statistical independence of the inputs , the model could therefore be improved ( at the loss of solvability , perhaps ) by extending the ranges of @xmath333 to include some portion of @xmath334 .",
    "this will account for the range of anti - correlation between neighboring contacts . extending the space this way",
    "will ensure that @xmath304 is nonvanishing for @xmath306 and will result in @xmath6 .",
    "this was demonstrated in the numerical solution of the mste .",
    "when the values of @xmath335 were extracted from the numerical data , it was found that they had a range @xmath336 .",
    "the lower limit reflects steric exclusion , and the upper limit reflects maximal separation on opposite sides of a grain .",
    "the use of the fsa makes it possible to solve the dos based upon edwards flat measure in a frictionless granular packing of smooth , round , rigid grains with localized isostacy .",
    "this produces a transport equation that can be solved ( at least numerically ) .",
    "solution of this transport equation in the msa was shown to produce the correct features for the contact force distributions .",
    "this success tends to validate edwards hypothesis : the dos appears to be dominated by features inherent to the static phase space , depending solely upon the packing s present fabric and the stress tensor .",
    "that is , the dos may not be shaped too significantly during the physics of the dynamic regime before the packings achieve static equilibrium .",
    "the need for further work is apparent .",
    "first , the two approximations have not been adequately validated .",
    "the quantitative results should be compared with simulations of rigid , frictionless grains with carefully controlled stress states and carefully measured fabric .",
    "this has not yet been performed because most studies have either included gravity or not reported the stress state or fabric .",
    "third , the analysis should be extended and numerical results presented for more general cases . the case with anisotropic stresses and fabric",
    "should demonstrate the qualitative evolution of the pdfs under shearing",
    ". this work has begun , and the initial results are hopeful .",
    "fourth , the forms of the functions that fit the numerical data for @xmath337 are tantalizingly simple . if the cause of this can be identified then a completely analytical solution to the mste may be possible .                                              a.  mehta and s.f .",

    "more importantly , it should be noted that @xmath226 along the boundary of a container is really @xmath255 , and due to the unusual contact geometries in the boundary layer the form of @xmath226 is not necessarily the same as it is in the bulk .",
