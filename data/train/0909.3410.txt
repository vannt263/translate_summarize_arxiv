    "large transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) have been observed in different hadronic reactions and these observations generated a lot of interest .",
    "such experiments are conceptually rather simple , but their theoretical description proved to be challenging as the leading - twist contributions to such asymmetries vanish , see @xcite for a review . over the past few years",
    "there was a splash of theoretical activity in this field , which mainly followed two lines : the @xmath0 factorization in terms of the transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) distributions ( e.g. @xcite ) , or , alternatively , collinear factorization including twist - three contributions in terms of multiparton correlation functions @xcite .",
    "these two techniques have their own domain of validity and were shown to be consistent with each other in the kinematic regime where they both apply @xcite .",
    "however , practically all existing calculations have been so far at the leading order ( lo ) which corresponds , roughly speaking , to the ( generalized ) parton model . in order to test the qcd dynamics and",
    "eventually also reduce the dependence of theory predictions on both the factorization scale and the renormalization scale of the strong coupling , it is necessary to calculate the scale dependence ( evolution ) of the relevant nonperturbative functions .",
    "the corresponding calculation was done in refs .",
    "@xcite where the evolution equation was derived for the gluonic pole contributions to twist - three correlation functions that are relevant to ssa .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that the equations derived in @xcite are in contradiction to earlier results obtained in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "a resolution of this discrepancy presents the main motivation for this study .    although we do reproduce the terms that appear in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain two additional contributions to the evolution equation both for flavor - nonsinget and flavor - singlet operators .",
    "we have found that part of the disagreement is due to omission of cut diagrams corresponding to the mixing of conventional twist - three correlation functions that are discussed in the context of ssa with the contributions involving a gluon and the quark - antiquark pair on the opposite sides of the cut .",
    "these are the same contributions that have been discussed for some time for semi - inclusive dis  @xcite , and the new observation in this work is that they necessarily contribute to the leading logarithmic accuracy through the ( factorization ) scale dependence . for another part we do not have an intuitive explanation .",
    "our ope - based calculation contains additional contributions ( compared to @xcite ) for which sending the gluon momentum to zero has to be done with caution , as will be explained in the text .",
    "another question that we want to address is to clarify the relation of these results to earlier calculations of the scale dependence of twist - three correlation functions that contribute to inclusive reactions , pioneered by the study of the structure function @xmath1 in ref .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the scale dependence of an _ arbitrary _ twist - three operator in qcd , hence _",
    "arbitrary _ twist - three light - cone correlation function can be determined in terms of the two - particle evolution kernels introduced by bukhvostov , frolov , lipatov and kuraev ( bflk ) @xcite .",
    "the bflk approach has become standard in calculations of the spectrum of anomalous dimensions ( dilatation operator ) in supersymmetric theories that are relevant to the ads / cft correspondence ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but , unfortunately , remains to be largely unknown to the broad qcd community .",
    "we will show that evolution equations for the particular parton distributions relevant for ssa @xcite do not require an independent calculation but can be obtained from the bflk kernels by simple algebra . using an updated version of this technique",
    "@xcite we derive the complete evolution equations for all relevant three - particle correlation functions for arbitrary gluon momenta .",
    "this generalization is necessary since the gluon - pole contributions considered in @xcite do not have autonomous scale dependence .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is introductory .",
    "we review basic properties of three - particle correlation functions and introduce a very convenient decomposition of momenta ( coordinates ) and the field operators in the spinor representation .",
    "this rewriting makes the symmetries explicit and drastically simplifies the forthcoming algebra .",
    "section 3 contains a detailed derivation of the flavor - nonsinglet evolution equation in the bflk approach and the comparison with @xcite .",
    "our result coincides identically with the corresponding equation for the quark - antiquark - gluon correlation function relevant for the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "the flavor - singlet evolution is considered in section 4 . in this case",
    "there are two independent evolution equations for positive and negative c - parity that involve three - gluon correlation functions involving @xmath2 structure constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . the equation for positive c - parity coincides , again , with the corresponding equation for the structure function @xmath1 , whereas the equation for negative c - parity is , to our knowledge , a new result ( in this form ) .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize .",
    "the full list of the bflk kernels in the momentum representation is collected in the appendix .",
    "following ref .  @xcite we will consider the correlation functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , corresponding to the nucleon matrix elements of the quark - antiquark - gluon light - ray operators @xmath7 and also the correlation functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to the three - gluon operators @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the light - like vector , @xmath12 , the `` plus '' projection is defined as @xmath13 .",
    "note that there are two gluon operators with a different color structure ; the factors @xmath14 are written in terms of the @xmath2 structure constants @xmath15 in all cases the path - ordered wilson lines are implied that ensure gauge invariance .",

    "@xcite , interpretation of light - cone correlation functions as describing sequential emission or absorption of quark- , antiquark- and gluon - partons by the target arises by choice of a particular representation in terms of the sum over intermediate states ( cut diagrams ) that does not involve semidisconnected contributions .",
    "in particular , the upper - right region in fig .  [ figure1 ] corresponds to emission of a pair of a quark - parton and a gluon with momentum fractions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , respectively , and subsequent absorption of the quark - parton with @xmath39 .",

    "alternatively , one may think of `` plus '' and `` minus '' labels as indicating whether the corresponding parton appears in the direct or the final amplitude in the cut diagram  @xcite .    ) in barycentric coordinates .",

    "for example , parton1 and parton2 can exchange a gluon whereas parton3 stays a spectator , etc .",
