    "while the inner spheroid of the galaxy is dominated by stars with metallicities near solar ( e.g. mcwilliam & rich 1994 , geisler & friel 1992 , ratag et al .",
    "1992 ) , there is also a modest population of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 .",
    "these metal - poor stars are potentially of great cosmological importance since , if the first episodes of star formation occured near the center of the present - day galaxy , where the density of gaseous material , and hence the incidence of cloud - cloud collisions , may have been greatest during early epochs , then they should be among the oldest objects in the galaxy ( e.g. larson 1990 ) .",
    "deep photometric surveys of globular clusters at low galactic latitudes will ultimately provide the most reliable means of charting the early evolution of the inner spheroid .",
    "a critical first step in the study of these objects is to determine basic cluster properties , such as metallicity , reddening , and distance so that targets can be selected for deep imaging surveys .",
    "while many low latitude clusters already have reddening , metallicity , and distance estimates , in the majority of cases these quantities were measured from data recorded at visible wavelengths , and hence are subject to uncertainties introduced by ( 1 ) the large and spatially variable levels of extinction prevalant at low galactic latitudes , and ( 2 ) contamination from bulge stars , which elevates crowding levels and can frustrate efforts to isolate cluster star samples .",
    "in addition , some low - latitude clusters lack cmds , adding further uncertainty to metallicity , reddening , and distance estimates .",
    "the complications introduced by reddening can be reduced by observing at infrared wavelengths , as the extinction in @xmath3 is roughly one - tenth that in @xmath7 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "the effects of field star contamination are also reduced in the infrared , since the contrast between the brightest red giants and the unresolved , relatively blue , body of the cluster is enhanced with respect to visible wavelengths , so that the richly populated central regions of clusters , where field star contamination is minimized , can be surveyed for bright stars from ground - based facilities using conventional observing techniques .    in the present study broad and narrow - band near -",
    "infrared observations are used to estimate the reddenings , metallicities , and distances of all globular clusters that , according to the 1996 version of the harris ( 1996 ) database , have [ fe / h ] @xmath1 and r@xmath8 kpc . metallicities and reddenings",
    "are determined from the shape and color of the upper giant branch on @xmath2 cmds , while distances are determined from the @xmath3 brightness of the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip .",
    "two important aspects of this survey are that ( 1 ) the data were recorded with a single instrumental setup during a 5 night observing run , thereby creating a homogeneous database that is free of the errors that might occur when observations from different runs and/or instruments are combined , and ( 2 ) narrow - band co indices are used to identify bright bulge stars , which will influence the measured cluster properties if not removed from the data .",
    "the clusters meeting the selection criteria are listed in table 1 .",
    "djorgovski 1 and hp 1 were originally observed as part of a preliminary metal - rich cluster survey that was also conducted during this observing run .",
    "however , subsequent investigation indicated that these clusters are metal - poor ( davidge 2000 ) , and so they were added to the current sample .",
    "the observations of ngc 6139 and ngc 6287 were discussed previously by davidge ( 1998 ) .",
    "the sample listed in table 1 is biased against heavily obscured clusters , which will predominate at the lowest galactic latitudes .",
    "evidence for such a bias comes from the projected distribution of the target clusters , which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the clusters do not follow the contours of the bulge , which has an axial ratio @xmath9 ( blanco & terndrup 1989 ) ; rather , the clusters tend to lie along the minor axis of the bulge and there is a dearth of clusters along the major axis . if it is assumed that there is an isotropically distributed metal - poor cluster population in the innermost regions of the galaxy , then a number of clusters evidently await discovery , especially at galactic latitudes @xmath10 ( e.g. frenk & white 1982 ) .",
    "the observations and the procedures used to reduce the data are described in  2 .",
    "the photometric measurements , luminosity functions ( lfs ) , color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , rgb - tip brightnesses , and integrated color measurements are discussed in  3 , as is the identification of metal - rich bulge stars .",
    "the distances , reddenings , metallicities , and near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the target clusters are investigated in  4 .",
    "the lfs of upper giant branch stars in bulge fields , which were observed to sample the background stellar component near the target clusters , are examined in  5 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  6 .",
    "the data were obtained with the cirim camera , which was mounted at the cassegrain focus of the ctio 1.5 metre telescope .",
    "cirim contains a @xmath11 hg : cd : te array , with an angular scale of 0.6 arcsec per pixel at this focus , so that each exposure covers a @xmath12 arcsec field .",
    "two fields were typically observed in and around each cluster , and these sampled the cluster center ( field 1 ) , and an area 2 arcmin north ( field 2 ) .",
    "a third field , offset 30 arcmin north of each cluster ( field 3 ) , was also observed to sample the properties of bulge stars near each cluster , and conduct a serendipitous survey of the bulge stellar content . at extremely low galactic latitudes , where the density of bulge stars may change rapidly with distance from the galactic center ( gc ) , and field - to - field differences in reddening can be significant , the field 3 data provide only a crude measure of the background in the vicinity of each cluster .",
    "only field 1 was observed for djorgovski 1 , while field 3 was not observed for ngc 6717 .",
    "the central regions of the halo clusters ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 were also observed .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath3 images were obtained of all fields , while co and @xmath14 m continuum images were also recorded of each field 1 so that the strength of @xmath15 m co absorption could be measured in moderately bright ( @xmath16 ) stars . a complete observing sequence consisted of four exposures per filter , with the telescope offset between each of these to create a @xmath17 arcsec square dither pattern .",
    "integration times for field 1 were kept to between 5 and 15 seconds per dither position for the broad - band filters to prevent saturating the brightest stars .",
    "the exposure times for fields 2 and 3 were 60 sec per dither position .",
    "the image quality , measured from the processed images , was typically 1.2 to 1.5 arcsec fwhm independent of wavelength , although image quality better than 1.2 arcsec would not be detected as such due to the 0.6 arcsec pixel sampling .",
    "the data were reduced using the procedures described by davidge & courteau ( 1999a ) . the processing sequence consisted of : ( 1 ) linearization , using coefficients supplied by ctio staff , ( 2 ) dark subtraction , ( 3 ) flat - fielding , using dome flats , ( 4 ) removal of thermal emission signatures and interference fringes , using calibration frames constructed from background sky fields , and ( 5 ) subtraction of the dc sky level , which was estimated by calculating the mode of the pixel intensity distribution for each image . the processed images for each field were then aligned to correct for the offsets introduced during acquisition , and the results were median - combined on a filter - by - filter basis to reject cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "the photometric calibration is based on observations of standard stars from elias et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and casali & hawarden ( 1992 ) , which have @xmath5 ranging between 0.2 and 0.9 . a total of 31 standard star observations were obtained .",
    "casali & hawarden ( 1992 ) give standard brightnesses in the ukirt system , and these were transformed into the cit / ctio system using the relations listed by these authors . the estimated uncertainty in the photometric zeropoints , based on the scatter in the standard star measurements ,",
    "is @xmath18 mag in @xmath19 , and the co index .",
    "the scatter in the calibration is demonstrated in figure 2 , which shows the difference between the standard and instrumental brightness in @xmath3 as a function of instrumental @xmath5 color .",
    "the scatter in this figure is comparable to what has been achieved in other near - infrared photometric studies with array detectors ( e.g. davidge & harris 1995 ) , and indicates that the error in a single observation is on the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the psf - fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , using star lists and psfs obtained from daophot ( stetson 1987 ) tasks .",
    "aperture corrections were derived from the 30  50 bright stars in each frame that were used to construct the psfs , after removing all other detected stars from the image .",
    "the majority of the inner spheroid clusters are located in densely populated bulge fields , and contamination from field stars complicates efforts to measure integrated colors and trace the cluster giant branch on the cmd . to extract a dataset for each cluster",
    "in which the ratio of cluster to bulge stars is relatively large , the radius at which the surface brightness profile of the underlying body of each cluster equals that of the surrounding background was estimated from the field 1 @xmath3 images .",
    "these measurements were made after subtracting all detected stars from the images and then smoothing the result with a @xmath20 arcsec top hat median filter to suppress undetected stars and artifacts of the subtraction process .",
    "for the remainder of the paper the regions interior to and exterior to this radius will be referred to as the ` inner cluster ' and ` outer cluster ' fields , respectively . for",
    "roughly one - third of the clusters the surface brightness profile exceeded that of the background over all of field 1 , and in these cases the ` inner cluster ' designation was assigned to field 1 in its entirety , and an ` outer cluster ' region was not defined .",
    "the inner cluster radii are listed in the last column of table 1 ; those clusters without an outer cluster field have a dash entered in this column .",
    "the lfs of ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 are shown in figure 3 , and these follow power - laws at the bright end .",
    "the hb produces a bump in the ngc 362 lf near @xmath21 , while the onset of the subgiant branch ( sgb ) is evident near the faint end of the ngc 288 and ngc 362 lfs ; the main sequence turn - off occurs near @xmath22 in ngc 288 ( davidge & harris 1997 ) .",
    "a crude measure of the completeness limit for each dataset can be estimated from the point at the faint end where the number counts start to decline , and the data in figure 3 are thus complete when @xmath23 .    to quantify the slopes of the lfs ,",
    "the method of least squares was used to fit power - laws in the brightness interval between the rgb - tip and the point at which incompleteness sets in ( ngc 7089 ) or the onset of the sgb ( ngc 288 and ngc 362 ) ; the hb was also omitted from the ngc 362 data .",
    "the exponents , @xmath24 , derived for these clusters are compared in table 2 , and these agree at the @xmath25 level .",
    "the mean value of @xmath24 , with each value weighted according to the reciprocal of the estimated uncertainty , is 0.17 .",
    "the @xmath3 lfs of the inner cluster fields , which are shown in figure 4 , also follow power - laws at the bright end .",
    "the field 3 @xmath3 lfs , which are truncated by detector saturation at @xmath26 , are shown as dashed lines in figure 4 , and it is evident that bulge stars contribute significantly to the number counts in many of the inner cluster fields .",
    "the field 3 lfs , which are discussed in more detail in  5 , also follow power - laws , and in many cases appear to be steeper than the cluster lfs .",
    "the degree of contamination from bulge stars varies substantially from cluster - to - cluster . to quantify this contamination ,",
    "the number densities of stars with @xmath3 between 10 and 12.5 in the inner cluster and bulge fields were counted and then ratioed to form a contamination index @xmath27 , and the results are listed in the last column of table 3 .",
    "the brightness interval for computing @xmath27 was chosen to bracket the saturation limit of the field 3 data ( @xmath26 ) and the approximate completeness limit for clusters in very crowded fields ( @xmath28 ) , such as hp 1 .",
    "the entries in table 3 indicate that bulge stars contribute at least 10% ( i.e. @xmath29 ) of the bright stellar content in the majority of inner cluster fields .",
    "the method of least squares was used to fit power - laws to each of the inner cluster fields after subtracting the field 3 lf , and the exponents computed in this manner are listed in the second column of table 3 .",
    "the fits were restricted to the brightness interval between @xmath26 and 12.5 . despite being restricted to the upper end of each giant branch , where the number of stars is modest , in the majority of cases the best fit power - law tracks the fainter portions of the giant branch .",
    "the weighted mean exponent is @xmath30 , indicating that the giant branches of the inner spheroid clusters are , on average , significantly steeper than those in the halo clusters .",
    "the exponent for ngc 6287 is significantly steeper than the mean , although the lf of this cluster becomes noticeably flatter when @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath2 cmds of ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 , based on stars that were detected in all 5 filters , are plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the cluster giant branches are clearly evident , as is the hb of ngc 362 near @xmath21 .",
    "the solid lines show the locus of the ngc 362 observations published by frogel , persson , & cohen ( 1983 ) , and the normal points for ngc 288 listed in table 2 of davidge & harris ( 1997 ) .",
    "the current data are in good agreement with these published observations .",
    "the brightest star detected near the center of ngc 288 is @xmath32 fainter than the rgb - tip of this cluster , based on the sample of stars observed by frogel , persson , & cohen ( 1983 ) .",
    "the present data do not sample bright upper giant branch stars in ngc 288 due to the relatively low central stellar density of this cluster .",
    "the cmds of ngc 288 and ngc 7089 are dominated by first ascent giants . however , a prominent asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) sequence , which dominates when @xmath33 , is seen @xmath34 mag blueward of the rgb in the ngc 362 cmd .",
    "the agb - tip brightness infered from the ngc 362 data is @xmath35 mag brighter in @xmath3 than the brightest star observed by frogel , persson , & cohen ( 1983 ) .",
    "a prominent agb sequence can also be seen above the hb in the @xmath36 cmd of ngc 362 obtained by harris ( 1982 ) , which is based on observations of stars in the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "the @xmath2 cmds of the inner cluster and bulge fields are shown in figure 6 .",
    "only stars detected in all five filters are plotted in the cluster cmds , while the bulge field cmds contain stars detected in all three broad - band filters .",
    "the quality of the cluster cmds is sensitive to field star contamination : the clusters with @xmath37 tend to have tight , well - defined cmds , while the scatter increases when @xmath29 .",
    "the cmds of djorgovski 1 ( @xmath38 ) , hp 1 ( @xmath39 ) , and ngc 6522 ( @xmath40 ) show two sequences , one belonging to the cluster , the other to the bulge .",
    "differential reddening likely also contributes to the scatter in the cmds of some clusters , such as ngc 6287 and ngc 6626 .",
    "the bulge field cmds are smeared by a combination of depth effects and the broad range of metallicities among bulge stars .",
    "the red hb clump of the bulge can be seen in the cmds of some bulge fields ( e.g. hp 1 , ngc 6453 , and ngc 6558 ) , and in fields with only moderate amounts of crowding there is the impression that the main sequence turn - off of the bulge has been detected .",
    "blue stars are also seen in some of the bulge cmds , and these are a combination of bulge hb and foreground disk objects .",
    "minniti , olszewski , & rieke ( 1995a ) obtained @xmath2 cmds of nine of the clusters studied here , while deep @xmath41 and @xmath3 observations of ngc 6626 were discussed by davidge , ct , & harris ( 1996 ) , and the trends defined in these studies are compared with the current cmds in figure 6 . with the exception of ngc 6293 and ngc 6333 , there is a tendency for the minniti et al .",
    "( 1995a ) data to have @xmath5 colors that are 0.2 to 0.4 mag larger than the current measurements .",
    "the giant branch sequences shown by minniti et al .",
    "( 1995a ) are not consistent with other published observations .",
    "for example , the m92 observations made by minniti et al .",
    "( 1995a ) have @xmath5 colors that are substantially larger than those measured by cohen , frogel , & persson ( 1978 ) .",
    "this is most evident near the rgb - tip , which minniti et al .",
    "place near @xmath42 , compared with @xmath43 measured by cohen et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and davidge & courteau ( 1999a ) .",
    "the minniti et al .",
    "( 1995a ) cmd of m22 also has @xmath5 colors that are 0.1  0.2 mag larger than the giant branch sequences defined by davidge & harris ( 1996 ) and frogel , persson , & cohen ( 1983 ) .",
    "uncertainties in the minniti et al .",
    "( 1995a ) color calibration would explain the substantial scatter in their figure 4 .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the co and @xmath14 m continuum filters differ by less than @xmath44 m , and so the co index is very insensitive to reddening variations , with @xmath45 ( elias , frogel , & humphreys 1985 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "this modest reddening dependence , combined with the metallicity sensitive nature of the @xmath15 m co bands , makes the co index a powerful tool for identifying metal - rich bulge stars , which can be difficult to identify solely from broad - band colors .",
    "the @xmath46 cmds for stars in ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the upper giant branches of these clusters define almost vertical sequences on the @xmath46 cmd , even near the rgb - tip .",
    "the co indices of upper giant branch stars in these clusters also show a marked metallicity dependence : stars in ngc 7089 , which is the most metal - poor cluster of the three , tend to have the smallest co indices , while stars in ngc 362 , which is the most metal - rich , tend to have the largest co values .",
    "stars in ngc 288 have co indices that fall almost midway between the other two clusters .    the @xmath46 cmds of the inner cluster fields are shown in the top panels of figure 8 , while the histogram distributions of co indices for stars with @xmath31 , where the observational scatter in the co indices is modest , are shown in the lower panels of figure 8 .",
    "the clusters with the lowest @xmath27 values tend to have the broadest co distributions , due to contamination from bulge stars , and in some cases the co distribution is bimodal . the clusters with the highest @xmath27 values , where bulge star contamination is smallest , have the tightest co distributions .",
    "to identify metal - rich bulge stars a critical co index was found for each cluster such that stars with co @xmath47 co@xmath48 are bulge objects while those with co",
    "@xmath49 co@xmath48 are likely cluster members .",
    "co@xmath48 was determined in two different ways , based on whether or not an outer cluster field was identified .",
    "clusters having both inner and outer cluster fields , which tend to be those with the smallest @xmath27 values , are considered first .",
    "the outer cluster fields are , by definition , dominated by bulge stars , so the co distribution of these fields should approximate that of the background .",
    "the co distributions of the inner and outer cluster fields , scaled according to field size , were subtracted and the co index for which an excess number of stars in the inner cluster field occured with respect to the outer cluster field was determined .",
    "the stars with co indices greater than this value in both the inner and outer cluster fields were rejected as bulge objects , and the remaining stars in both fields were assumed to be cluster members .    in practice only a modest number of stars were rejected using this criterion , although significant rejection rates occured for djorgovski 1 , hp 1 , ngc 6522 , and ngc 6558 .",
    "the cmds of these clusters before and after the removal of bulge stars are compared in figure 9 , and it is evident that the removal of bulge stars greatly affects the cmds of these clusters near the bright end .",
    "the rejection of stars with large co indices noticeably reduces the scatter in the @xmath2 cmds , and this is most evident in the ngc 6522 dataset .",
    "the differencing technique described above can not be applied to clusters where an outer cluster field was not defined .",
    "however , the @xmath46 cmds of the clusters that lack an outer cluster field tend to be relatively well - defined with only modest amounts of scatter , so that stars that deviate significantly from the cluster locus can be readily identified . for these clusters ,",
    "the envelope of co indices on the @xmath46 cmd was defined by eye , and stars falling to the right of this envelope were rejected as bulge stars .",
    "only a few stars were rejected per cluster .",
    "the rejection techniques described above identify only those stars that are significantly more metal - rich than the cluster , so that metal - poor bulge stars will not be rejected .",
    "lacking additional information , such as the space motions of stars in these fields , the removal of metal - poor bulge stars is problematic .",
    "however , the metallicity distribution function of the bulge peaks near solar values , with the majority of objects having [ m / h ] @xmath50 ( e.g. mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) . hence , while the techniques applied here do not identify metal - poor bulge stars , the density of these objects is expected to be small compared with that of cluster stars .",
    "the hb is an almost vertical sequence on the infrared cmds of metal - poor clusters ( e.g. davidge & courteau 1999a ) , and so is not well - suited as either a reference point for the vertical registration of cmds or as a distance indicator at these wavelengths .",
    "if a cluster contains rr lyrae variables with known periods then the infrared period - luminosity relation ( carney , storm , & jones 1992 ; longmore et al .",
    "1990 ) can be applied , although for low latitude clusters contamination from field rr lyraes must then be considered .",
    "the rgb - tip provides an alternate distance indicator in the infrared that , at least for clusters that are significantly more metal - poor than the dominant bulge component , can be corrected for field star contamination .",
    "a potential concern is that evolution on the upper giant branch proceeds at a relatively rapid pace , so that stars near the rgb - tip are rare when compared with earlier phases of evolution , and this may introduce biases in the rgb - tip brightness measurement .",
    "however , numerical simulations predict that modest surveys of bright stellar content are sufficient to estimate the rgb - tip brightness in globular clusters to @xmath51 mag ( crocker & rood 1984 ) , and this prediction has been verified observationally ( e.g. figure 6 of frogel , cohen , & persson 1983 ) .    the @xmath3 brightness of the rgb - tip was estimated for each cluster by identifying the brightest star on the giant branch locus after removing metal - rich bulge stars , and the results are listed in the second column of table 4 .",
    "the stellar density near the center of ngc 288 is relatively low , and the field studied here is devoid of stars on the upper portions of the rgb .",
    "therefore , the rgb - tip brightness for ngc 288 in table 4 is based on the observations made by frogel , persson , & cohen ( 1983 ) .",
    "the histogram distribution of rgb - tip brightnesses , shown in the top panel of figure 10 , is skewed slightly towards systems with larger values of k@xmath52 , due to a small number of clusters with significantly higher than average reddenings .",
    "the mean rgb - tip brightness is @xmath53 , with a standard deviation of 0.6 mag .",
    "integrated colors provide another means of investigating the stellar content and chemical composition of globular clusters , although contamination from bright field stars is an issue at low galactic latitudes ( davidge 2000 , bica et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the current study ,",
    "integrated color measurements were restricted to the inner cluster fields , with the sky background measured in the outer cluster field .",
    "for those clusters where an outer cluster field was not defined , the colors were measured in a 51 arcsec radius annulus centered on the cluster , with the background measured in a 20 arcsec wide annulus at the edge of each frame , thereby sampling an area comparable to that of the central aperture .",
    "this latter procedure was also applied to ngc 362 and ngc 7089 .",
    "integrated colors could not be measured for ngc 288 because of the diffuse nature of this cluster .",
    "the integrated colors of the clusters considered in this paper are listed in table 4 .",
    "the integrated colors for djorgovski 1 and hp 1 are those listed in table 4 of davidge ( 2000 ) .",
    "metallicities and reddenings were estimated by comparing the upper portions of the giant branch on the @xmath2 cmd with the 16 gyr bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) isochrones .",
    "normal points were generated for each cluster by calculating the mean @xmath5 color in @xmath54 mag bins along the @xmath3 axes of the @xmath2 cmds and applying a @xmath55 rejection criteria to remove outliers .",
    "the bergbusch & vandenberg models were selected as reference sequences because ( 1 ) they were computed with up - to - date input physics , and include the effects of oxygen - enhancement ( but not enhancement of other @xmath56 elements ) , ( 2 ) they span a wide range of metallicities , with a sample interval @xmath57[fe / h ] @xmath58 dex at the metal - poor end , and ( 3 ) near - infrared observations of cluster stars were used to fine - tune the isochrones near the rgb - tip ( vandenberg 1992 ) .",
    "bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) list @xmath7 and @xmath59 pairs at various points along each isochrone , and these were transformed into @xmath3 and @xmath5 using the relations between visible and infrared colors listed in table 5 of davidge & harris ( 1995 ) , which were derived from the giant branches of globular clusters with [ fe / h ] between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the transformed isochrones were shifted to the apparent distance of each cluster using the rgb - tip brightnesses listed in table 4 and , with the vertical placement thus fixed , the sequences were translated along the horizontal axes to fit the cluster giant branch .",
    "the metallicity adopted for each cluster is that of the isochrone that best fits the normal point sequence , while the net translation along the color axis for the best fitting isochrone gives @xmath62 .",
    "the metallicities and reddenings predicted for ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 are listed in the second , third , and fourth columns of table 5 , while the corresponding quantities from harris ( 1996 ) are listed in the last two columns .",
    "the ngc 288 cirim observations do not sample the upper portion of the giant branch , which is the portion of the cmd that contains the most significant information for metallicity determinations , and so the data for this cluster were supplemented with normal points derived from the aperture measurements made by frogel , cohen , & persson ( 1983 ) .",
    "the metallicities derived from the isochrones are systematically smaller than those listed by harris ( 1996 ) . to investigate",
    "if this trend is unique to the current observations , the metallicity of m13 was estimated using normal points derived from the measurements published by cohen et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and davidge & harris ( 1995 ) , and the result is shown in the last row of table 5 .",
    "the resulting metallicity estimate for m13 is smaller than that given by harris ( 1996 ) , by an amount that is consistent with the ngc 288 , ngc 362 , and ngc 7089 values .",
    "the mean offset from the harris ( 1996 ) metallicities for the four clusters listed in table 5 is @xmath63 , and all subsequent metallicity estimates derived from the shape of the upper giant branch will be adjusted by this amount .",
    "the systematic difference between the metallicity estimates in table 5 occurs because the models overestimate the slope of the upper giant branch .",
    "vandenberg ( 1992 ) attempted to correct for this by adjusting the surface pressure boundary conditions to force agreement with upper giant branch sequences for globular clusters with infrared observations .",
    "however , it is evident from the m13 and m92 sequences on figure 6 of vandenberg ( 1992 ) that the corrected models still underestimate the metallicities of metal - poor clusters .",
    "vandenberg ( 1992 ) noted that there are a number of possible causes for this effect .",
    "the lfs predicted from these models also do not match those of very metal - poor clusters near the rgb - tip ( vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1996 ) , while the terminal rgb core masses are lower than those predicted by other models ( caloi , dantona , & mazzitelli 1997 , silvestri et al .",

    "the metallicities computed for both clusters are in reasonable agreement with those given by harris ( 1996 ) , so errors in metallicity do not present an obvious explanation for the red colors .",
    "the presence of bulge stars can affect integrated color measurements ( davidge 2000 ) , although the @xmath46 cmds of these clusters indicate that a large population of bright bulge stars is not present in the inner cluster fields , where the integrated photometric measurements were made .",

    "these data thus suggest that the integrated co index in some metal - poor inner spheroid clusters may be affected by quantities other than metallicity .",
    "it might be anticipated that the reddenings of some of the cluster and nearby bulge fields may differ due to the patchy nature of obscuration at low galactic latitudes .",
    "unfortunately , the low stellar densities in many of the bulge fields hinder efforts to measure reddening directly .",

    "the rate of evolution on the upper giant branch is insensitive to metallicity ( vandenberg 1992 ) , so the power - law exponent that characterizes the bright ends of the lfs should not vary significantly among the field 3 datasets , even though the mean metallicity of the bulge changes with radius ( e.g. minniti et al .",

    "the metallicities and reddenings derived from the near - infrared cmds tend to be in good agreement with those given by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the survey is not a complete census of metal - poor inner spheroid clusters , as uncertainties in the published values of [ fe / h ] and r@xmath115 , on which the sample selection is based , have likely caused clusters with intrinsic parameters matching the selection criteria to be excluded .",

    "for example , the brightest bulge stars are on the near side of the bulge and , if these are mistakenly assumed to be cluster members , they will skew cluster distances to values less than that of the gc .",
    "bulge star contamination could thus explain why barbuy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find an absence of metal - rich clusters on the far side of the bulge . indeed",
    ", the current data suggests that djorgovski 1 , which is in a densely populated bulge field and is one of the clusters in the barbuy et al .",
    "sample , is on the far side of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the majority of bulge stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath116 , and the inclusion of these objects in cluster studies will skew metallicities upwards . this effect has been well documented in the particular case of hp 1 ( e.g. ortolani , bica , & barbuy 1997 , bica et al .",
    "1998 , davidge 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 brightness of the rgb - tip , which is determined from bright stars that can be identified as cluster members using co indices , is a useful supplemental distance indicator for globular clusters , especially for those that are heavily reddened and occur in dense bulge fields , where the hb brightness may be highly uncertain .",

    "however , this picture has recently been challenged in two ways .",
    "first , deep photometric studies of metal - poor clusters within a few kpc of the gc , such as ngc 6287 ( davidge & courteau 1999a , stetson & west 1994 ) , terzan 1 ( ortolani et al . 1999 ) , and ngc 6558 ( rich et al . 1998 ) reveal hb morphologies that differ from those of old halo clusters .",
    "second , parameters other than age and metallicity may influence hb morphology ( e.g. salaris & weiss 1997 , buonanno et al . 1997 ) , thereby complicating the interpretation of hb data .",
    "consequently , it is of interest to investigate other ways in which the observational properties of inner and outer spheroid clusters differ .",
    "the current data indicate that inner spheroid clusters tend to have steeper giant branch lfs than halo clusters .",
    "clusters in the inner and outer spheroid have experienced different dynamical histories ( e.g. murali & weinberg 1997 , vesperini 1997 , 1998 , and references therein ) , and this could affect the bright stellar content . the appearance of population gradients within clusters is related to dynamical evolution ( e.g. discussion in  4.2 ) , and dynamical evolution will likely occur at a rapid pace in the densely - populated inner regions of the galaxy . indeed , rich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggest that ngc 6522 , ngc 6558 , and hp 1 may be part of a new class of dynamically evolved clusters , characterised by a larger than average ratio of hb stars to bright giants , that are the result of interactions in the inner galaxy .",

    "the departures from the integrated co versus metallicity relation are also likely not due to extreme [ cno / fe ] abundances , as the scatter in the co@xmath66 indices indicate that any cluster - to - cluster differences in [ cno / fe ] are not much larger than what has already been detected among halo stars .",

    "the slopes measured from the @xmath2 cmds of these fields are listed in table 10 ; the fields in this table are ordered according to distance above the galactic plane .",
    "the slope of the giant branch in ngc 6522 field 3 is in excellent agreement with that measured by tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for bw .",
    "the slopes listed in table 10 show a great deal of scatter , with no obvious trend with @xmath121 .",
    "the uncertainties in the slope estimates propogate into significant errors in [ fe / h ] estimates , which were computed from equation 1 of tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and are listed in the fourth column of table 10 .",
    "the fields considered in table 10 do not cover a large enough range of @xmath121 to permit an independent investigation of the bulge metallicity gradient .",
    "however , the metallicities derived here can be combined with those measured in other studies .",
    "the metallicities for ngc 6522 field 3 and ngc 6453 field 3 were averaged to create a single point for @xmath121 = 3.9 , while the metallicities for the last four points were averaged to produce a mean for @xmath121 = 6 .",
    "these were then combined with the data in table 8 of tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to create new average metallicities at these @xmath121 .",
    "the results for hp 1 field 3 were also combined with the terzan 2 entry in that table .",
    "a least squares fit was then applied to the data in the last column of table 8 of tiede et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , with the entries for @xmath121 = 2.3 , 3.9 , and 6 adjusted as described above , and the gradient measured in this manner is @xmath57[fe / h]/@xmath122 .",
    "the bulge data are also suggestive of field - to - field differences in hb content . in particular , while the hb is not conspicuous in the majority of field 3 lfs in figure 15 , a hb bump is clearly evident near @xmath123 in the ngc 6453 and ngc 6558 background field lfs .",
    "there is also a tantalizing hint of a hb bump in the hp 1 field 3 lf , but the effects of incompleteness (  5 ) make the reality of this feature difficult to quantify with the existing data .",
    "the ngc 6453 and ngc 6558 background fields sample regions of the bulge that are roughly 6 degrees from the gc , suggesting a possible connection with distance from the gc . however , ngc 6355 field 3 samples a region that is 5.4 degrees from the gc , and a distinct hb is not evident in the lf of this field ; consequently , the current data are not consistent with a simple radial trend .",
    "the @xmath3 lfs of ngc 6453 field 3 , ngc 6558 field 3 , and ngc 6355 field 3 in a narrow brightness interval centered on the hb are compared in figure 16 ; the composite bulge lf described in  5 is also plotted in this figure .",
    "the lfs in this figure were normalized and then shifted by arbitrary amounts along the vertical axis for the purposes of display .",
    "the strong hb features in the ngc 6453 field 3 and ngc 6558 field 3 data are clearly evident .",
    "a kolmogoroff - smirnoff test indicates that the combined lfs of both fields between k = 12.5 and 14.0 differs from that of the composite bulge lf at roughly the @xmath25 level .",
    "these data suggest that the hb content is not uniform throughout the bulge , and a moderately deep photometric near - infrared survey of fields within a few arcmin of the gc should be able to verify or refute this result .",
    "the uniformity of the r statistic at moderate distances from the gc ( minniti 1995 ) suggests that variations in hb content , if present , will be restricted to the inner spheroid .",
    "the presence of variations in hb content are not entirely unexpected given that ( 1 ) the bulge contains a metallicity gradient , and ( 2 ) hb morphology changes with metallicity .",
    "age will also affect hb content , and paczynski et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and kiraga , paczynski & stanek ( 1997 ) have noted that an intermediate - age population may explain the large number of red hb stars in bw . if the relative contribution of such an intermediate age component to total light varies with location in the bulge then this will also cause a non - uniform hb content .",
