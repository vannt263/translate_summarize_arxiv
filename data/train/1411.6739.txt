    "using multiple - antenna arrays has been well known for its benefits : high reliability , high spectral efficiency and interference reduction . recently a new approach , _ massive _ mimo , has emerged by equipping communication terminals with a huge number of antennas .",
    "this reaps the benefits of the traditional mimo systems on a much larger scale .",
    "@xcite mathematically showed that the effect of fast fading and non - correlated noise is eliminated as the number of receive antennas approaches infinity .",
    "since then , extensive research interests have been generated in massive mimo .",
    "for example , massive mimo systems information - theoretic and propagation aspects are discussed in @xcite .",
    "research on massive mimo has also focused on many other aspects , including transmit and receive schemes , the effect of pilot contamination , energy efficiency , and channel estimation for massive mimo systems , as overviewed in @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) is required to achieve the advantages of massive mimo systems @xcite .",
    "however , accurately estimating the channel gains in wireless systems is a big challenge , especially in fast fading environments @xcite . in case of conventional mimo systems , differential modulation techniques , blind and semi - blind , and pilot based algorithms are used to solve the problem of channel tracking @xcite .",
    "although these algorithms have improved the performance of non - coherent mimo systems , they are not optimal for massive time - varying channels . compared with traditional mimo systems ,",
    "it is even more challenging to perform accurate channel state estimation for massive mimo systems , considering massive mimo s large number of unknown channel coefficients .",
    "it is of great theoretical and practical interest to investigate near - optimal or optimal non - coherent data transmission and data detection schemes for massive mimo systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of joint ml channel estimation and data detection for massive simo systems .",
    "an extensive list of works have addressed non - coherent data detection problems for conventional simo wireless systems or wireless systems in general .",
    "most existing efficient mimo non - coherent signal detection algorithms are suboptimal compared with the exact ml algorithms .",
    "however , there are a few exceptions . for instance",
    ", sphere decoder algorithm was used in @xcite to solve the joint ml non - coherent problem for simo wireless systems .",
    "sphere decoder algorithm reduces the computational complexity by restricting the ml detection search to a subset of the signal space .",
    "@xcite also used sphere decoder algorithms to achieve the ml channel estimation and data detection for orthogonal space time block coded ( ostbc ) wireless systems . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the sphere decoder algorithm has been shown as an exact ml non - coherent detection algorithm which has a lower complexity than the exhaustive search , but the sphere decoder works only for constant - modulus constellations .",
    "@xcite proposed an exact joint ml channel estimation and signal detection algorithm for simo systems with general constellations .",
    "@xcite proposed an exact ml channel estimation and data detection for ofdm wireless systems with general constellations .",
    "an ml non - coherent signal detection algorithm for ostbc was developed in @xcite for constant - modulus constellations .",
    "the algorithm proposed in @xcite uses recent results on efficient maximization of reduced - rank quadratic form to achieve a polynomial complexity .",
    "the optimal non - coherent data detection algorithms from @xcite and @xcite did not look at the non - coherent data detection complexity as the number of receive antennas grows large in massive simo systems .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm in @xcite gives an exact ml solution only when the matrix in the related quadratic form optimization problem has low rank , but this low - rank assumption does not hold for massive simo systems with a large number of receive antennas . without efficient algorithms achieving optimal non - coherent data detection for massive mimo systems ,",
    "it was not known how suboptimal non - coherent data detection methods compare with the ml non - coherent data detection methods .",
    "it was believed that the goal of achieving joint ml channel estimation and data detection is even more difficult for massive mimo systems , because of a large number of unknown channel coefficients @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study and improve a joint ml channel estimation and data detection algorithm for massive simo systems .",
    "surprisingly , despite a large number of unknown channel coefficients for massive simo systems , this algorithm achieves the exact ml non - coherent data detection with a low expected complexity .",
    "we theoretically show that the expected computational complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of receive antennas and polynomial in channel coherence time .",
    "simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of our optimal non - coherent data detection with a low computational complexity . to the best of our knowledge , for the first time",
    ", we have demonstrated the exact performance gap between the optimal non - coherent data detection algorithm , and suboptimal non - coherent data detection algorithms , for massive simo systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem ] sets up the system model and presents the ml non - coherent data detection algorithm .",
    "section [ sec : complexity ] derives the expected complexity of the algorithm .",
    "simulation results are provided and discussed in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes our paper and highlights our contribution .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the length of a data packet during which the channel remains constant .",
    "the channel output for a simo system with @xmath1 receive antennas is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the simo channel vector , @xmath4 is the transmitted symbol sequence , and @xmath5 is an additive noise matrix whose elements are assumed to be i.i.d . complex gaussian random variables",
    ". we also assume the entries of @xmath6 are i.i.d .",
    "symbols from a certain constant - modulus constellation @xmath7 ( such as bpsk or qpsk ) which has unit expected energy , i.e. , @xmath8 we assume @xmath9 as a deterministic unknown channel with no priori information known about it @xcite@xcite .",
    "then , the joint ml channel estimation and data detection problem for simo systems is given by the following mixed optimization problem @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the set of @xmath0-dimensional signal vectors . from @xcite , the optimization to ( [ eq : mixed ] ) over @xmath9 is a least square problem while the optimization over @xmath6 is an integer least square problem , since each elements of @xmath6 is chosen from a fixed constellation @xmath7 . by @xcite , for any given symbol vectors @xmath6 , the channel vector @xmath9 that minimizes ( [ eq : mixed ] ) is @xmath12 substituting ( [ eq : opth ] ) into ( [ eq : mixed ] ) , we get @xmath13 as pointed ou t in @xcite , if the modulation constellation is of constant modulus ( such as qpsk ) , the minimization of ( [ eq : optmetric ] ) over @xmath6 is equivalent to solve the following problem : @xmath14 the quadratic form in ( [ eq : max ] ) for a constant modulus modulation can be changed into an equivalent minimization problem by using the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath15 . thus , ( [ eq : max ] ) can be represented as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a slightly larger value than the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath18 .",
    "the traditional solution of an integer least square optimization problem in ( [ eq : min ] ) is by using exhaustive search over the entire lattice .",
    "however , the computational complexity of exhaustive search is exponential in @xmath0 .",
    "sphere decoder was used in @xcite to efficiently solve ( [ eq : min ] ) with a lower computational complexity than exhaustive search . instead of searching over all the hypotheses in the lattice , sphere decoder attempts to look at the lattice points within a radius @xmath19 .",
    "as a result , the searching process of sphere decoder only visits the sequences that are inside the hypersphere of radius @xmath19 @xmath20    from the way in which @xmath17 is determined , the matrix @xmath21 in ( [ eq : min ] ) is positive semidefinite .",
    "we can use the cholesky decomposition to factorize @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an upper triangular matrix .",
    "now we can rewrite ( [ eq : min ] ) as @xmath24 since @xmath23 is an upper triangular matrix , @xmath25 can be expanded as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the metric of the transmitted vector @xmath6 , and @xmath28 is the entry of @xmath23 in the @xmath29-th row and @xmath30-th column . for each @xmath29 between @xmath31 and @xmath0 , we further define @xmath32 where the partial sequence @xmath33 consist of elements @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... ,",

    "+    in our analysis of this algorithm for massive simo systems , we will slightly change the algorithm in the last step : if no sequence is ever found in step 4 , we will increase @xmath19 to @xmath54 .",
    "the choice of the radius @xmath19 has a big influence on the complexity of this ml algorithm .",
    "if @xmath55 is chosen bigger than the metric of any sequence @xmath56 , the ml algorithm will visit all the tree nodes under that radius .",
    "if @xmath55 is too small , then the ml sequence may be outside the search radius , and the ml algorithm will have to search again under a new larger radius .",
    "@xcite derived how to choose @xmath19 such that with a certain probability , the transmitted sequence has a metric no bigger than @xmath55 .",
    "however , the radius choice in @xcite is for a fixed number of receive antennas , and for high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .    in this paper",
    ", we quantify the choice of radius @xmath19 when the number of receive antennas is big , as in massive mimo systems .",
    "in fact we set @xmath55 as any constant @xmath57 such that @xmath58    we remark that this radius choice is different from @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the new radius value does not depend on the snr or the number of receive antennas .",
    "in fact , one can choose the radius of @xmath55 to be a positive constant arbitrarily close to 0 , for a large simo system .",
    "in the next section , we will show that , under this new radius , the joint ml channel estimation and data detection algorithm has very low computational complexity .",
    "the computational complexity of the joint ml channel estimation and data detection algorithm for simo systems is mainly determined by the number of visited nodes in each layer . by `` visited nodes '' , we mean the partial sequences @xmath33 for which @xmath37 is computed in the algorithm . the fewer the visited nodes , the lower computational complexity the joint ml algorithm needs .",
    "in this section , we will show that the number of visited points in each layer will converge to a constant number for a sufficient large number of receive antennas .    in the joint maximum - likelihood joint channel estimation and data detection algorithm ,",
    "the expected number of visited points at layer @xmath29 with @xmath1 receive antennas converges to @xmath59 for @xmath60 , as @xmath1 goes to infinity .",

    "in fact , based on ( [ eq : metric ] ) , the metric @xmath96 from ( [ eq : min ] ) is @xmath97 since @xmath98 . because @xmath99 , from ( [ eq : mertici3 ] ) , we must have @xmath100 @xmath101 for every @xmath102",

    "in this section , we simulate the performance and complexity of the exact ml algorithm for simo systems with a large number of receive antennas .",
    "we use the 4-qam constant modulus constellation .",

    "we compare the performance of the joint ml non - coherent data detection algorithm with sub - optimal iterative and non - iterative channel estimation and data detection schemes .",
    "we use least square ( ls ) and minimum mean square error ( mmse ) channel estimation for the iterative and non - iterative detection schemes ( the reader may refer to for the ls and mmse channel estimation ) .",

    "the average number of visited nodes per layer is already very low . when @xmath158 , the number of average visited nodes per layer is steady at a constant number , namely 4 .",
    "when the number of receive antennas goes from @xmath152 to @xmath158 , the simulation results show a clear reduction in the tree search complexity .",
    "also , under a sufficiently large number of receive antennas , on average the joint ml algorithm will visit each layer 4 times , which is equal to the cardinality of the 4-qam constellation .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical prediction of our theorem [ thm : ltt1 ] .",
