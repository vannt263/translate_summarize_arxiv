    "we are interested in developing the gaussian beam method for the dirac equation in the semi - classical regime @xmath2 subject to the cauchy initial data @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the spinor field , normalized s.t .",
    ", @xmath5 @xmath6 denotes the semi - classical parameter , @xmath7 is the external electric potential and @xmath8 represents the external magnetic potential , i.e. , @xmath9 . without loss of generality , we only consider static external field in this paper .",
    "the dirac matrices @xmath10 are complex - valued hermitian matrices , which are given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 the @xmath13 identity matrix and @xmath14 the @xmath13 pauli matrices , i.e. , @xmath15 the physical observables can be defined in terms of @xmath16 : @xmath17    the dirac equation @xcite is a relativistic wave equation which plays a fundamental role in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "it provides a natural description of the particles with spin @xmath18 , i.e. electrons , neutrinos , muons , protons , neutrons , etc .",
    "the dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects , such as klein s paradox @xcite and  zitterbewegung \" an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle @xcite .",
    "recently , graphene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite are studied widely in connection to the dirac equation in the semiclassical regime @xcite .    in the semi - classical regime @xmath0 ,",
    "the solution to the dirac equation is highly oscillatory .",
    "thus , for any domain - based discretization method , the number of mesh points in each spatial direction should be at least @xmath19 @xcite . if the potential is sufficiently smooth , and the initial data of the dirac equation is compactly supported , the time - splitting spectral method @xcite offers the best numerical resolution .",
    "the spatial meshing strategy is almost of optimal order @xmath19 and the time step can be @xmath20 .",
    "one alternative efficient numerical approach for solving the dirac equation is the wkb method @xcite . for a first order approximation , this method tries to seek an asymptotic solution : @xmath21 where the amplitude @xmath22 and the phase @xmath23 are smooth functions independent of @xmath24 . substituting into the dirac equation ,",
    "one derives the eikonal equation and the transport equation .",
    "since the eikonal equation is of the hamilton - jacobi type , the solution becomes singular after caustic formulation . beyond caustics ,",
    "the correct semi - classical solution of the dirac equation contains several phases . in the last decades",
    ", many approaches have been proposed to capture this multi - phased solutions , see reviews @xcite .",
    "a serious drawback of the wkb method is that the solution ceases to be valid at caustics where the rays intersect and the amplitudes blow up .",
    "the gaussian beam method , which was first proposed by heller in quantum chemistry @xcite and independently developed by popov in geophysics @xcite , is an efficient approach that allows accurate computation of the amplitude and phase information near caustics .",
    "the main difference between the wkb method and the gaussian beam method is that the gaussian beam method allows the phase function to be complex off the center of the beam and the imaginary part of the phase function is positive definite , which makes the solution decay exponentially away from the center .",
    "the validity of the gaussian beam method at caustics was analyzed by ralston in @xcite .",
    "the gaussian beam and related methods have become very popular in high frequency waves problems @xcite in recent years .",
    "most of the methods were in the lagrangian framework .",
    "more recently , eulerian gaussian beam methods have also received a special attention for its advantages of uniform accuracy @xcite .",
    "a major simplification of the eulerian gaussian beam method is that the hessian matrices can be constructed by taking derivatives of the level set functions @xcite .",
    "this greatly reduces the computational cost .    to our knowledge",
    ", no gaussian beam methods have previously been developed for the dirac equation .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to develop such a method by extending the previous method of @xcite for the schrdinger equation to the dirac equation - . with the help of the eigenvalue decomposition ,",
    "the gaussian beams evolve independently of each other .",
    "moreover , the energy transition is forbidden since the dirac matrix @xmath25 results an @xmath20 band gap .",
    "being different from the gaussian beam methods for the schrdinger equation , the higher order taylor expansion and asymptotic expansion must be considered for the amplitude . after making use of the solvability condition and matching the different expansions ,",
    "one gets the transport equation for the lower order term of the amplitude .",
    "when the evolution is done , the solution can be simply constructed by the summation of all gaussian beams .",
    "the solution will be shown to have a good accuracy even around caustics , with a coarse mesh size of @xmath26 and large time step of @xmath26 .",
    "a remarkable aspect of the eulerian gaussian beam method is that it still possesses the advantage of the previous method @xcite , which is an important benefit for the @xmath27 simulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after reviewing the semi - classical limit of the dirac equation in section [ sec : dic ]",
    ", we formulate the gaussian beam method for - in section [ sec : gbm ] . in section [ sec : numexa ] , our method is shown to be accurate and efficient by several numerical examples .",

    ", we describe how to solve the dirac equation by the lagrangian gaussian beam method , which is given by the following ansatz : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a second order taylor truncated phase function @xmath51 here @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "as discussed in @xcite , to compute the gaussian beam solutions for the schrdinger equation , the optimal mesh can be @xmath69 and the time step requirement is of order @xmath69 .",
