    "the reaction @xmath1  near threshold is very sensitive to the description of the @xmath2-interaction and to @xmath0  production mechanisms . due to the underlying chiral symmetry",
    "both the single - nucleon term and the pion - rescattering contribution are suppressed near threshold @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitude then results from a delicate interference between these and various additional contributions of shorter range @xcite .",
    "the relevance and relative importance of various reaction mechanisms , in particular the short range ones , has not yet been firmly established .",
    "a treatment of these mechanisms consistent with the @xmath2 interactions employed in the description of the final and initial state is needed to clarify the large model dependence .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the transferred hadronic momentum , which is typically @xmath3 , calls for a relativistic approach .    in this letter",
    "we re - examine the single - nucleon term using the covariant spectator description @xcite for both the production mechanism and for the initial and final state @xmath4  interaction . the pion emission from a single proton",
    "is described by the feynman diagrams of figure 1 .",
    "the obe spectator models @xcite allow a direct covariant evaluation of diagrams ( a)-(c ) .",
    "dynamically , these are the only model - independent contributions",
    ". there might be additional reaction mechanisms , in particular involving pion rescattering , such as diagram ( d ) .",
    "they have not yet been included in our calculations .",
    "the intermediate state nucleons in diagrams ( a)-(c ) can propagate with positive and negative energy .",
    "we will split the contribution of these diagrams into amplitudes @xmath5  and @xmath6with the superscript indicating the sign of the energy of the off - shell nucleon after and/or before the pion emission .",
    "our approach differs crucially from earlier ones in two aspects .",
    "firstly , it includes nonperturbatively diagrams with intermediate negative - energy nucleons . in perturbative approaches",
    "these contributions are simulated by the inclusion of effective meson - exchange operators acting in two - nucleon space ( their contributions are often called `` z - diagrams '' ) . more specifically , one takes the amplitudes @xmath7  and @xmath8   ( with the nucleons in the initial and final state on - shell ) to the lowest order in @xmath9 , replacing the @xmath2 interaction by a single one - meson exchange , usually taking into account only the most important meson exchanges . written in the space of two - component pauli spinors these amplitudes",
    "are identified with effective pion - production meson - exchange operators and their expectation values are then calculated with conventional nuclear wave functions .",
    "these transition amplitudes simulate those contributions of the diagrams @xmath10  and @xmath11   for which the transition to negative - energy nucleons occurs only once .    in previous perturbative calculations @xcite the most important contributions to the z - diagram operator",
    "were found to be the exchanges of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  mesons .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the pion z - graph yields a much smaller contribution than the @xmath12  and @xmath13  diagrams .",
    "it is often considered together with other model dependent off - shell pion - rescattering processes @xcite . in @xmath15-expansion calculations ,",
    "the @xmath12  and @xmath13  z - graphs were found to dominate the short range reaction mechanisms and provide contributions essential for the explanation of the data .",
    "in contrast , in the present covariant calculations we obtained significantly smaller contributions from terms with negative - energy nucleons .    secondly , the @xmath2-models considered recently @xcite include non - minimal dynamical effects produced by off - shell scalar - nucleon coupling , scaled by a parameter @xmath16 : @xmath17 \\right\\ } \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . both @xmath2-observables and the triton binding energy appear to be rather sensitive to this off - shell extension , hence it is very interesting to find out if it also works favorably in the considered reaction .",
    "taking only diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath12  and @xmath13  exchange in born approximation , we , indeed , have found a rather strong dependence on the parameter @xmath16 , mainly due to the cancellation between @xmath12  and @xmath13  terms .",
    "however , the variation is much weaker when the full interaction is included .",
    "near threshold the reaction is dominated by transition between initial @xmath20  and final @xmath21   @xmath4   partial waves ; only these are considered in our calculations .",
    "the total cross section is given @xcite in terms of the covariant transition amplitude @xmath22 : @xmath23 & = & \\frac{10 ^ 4 ( \\hbar c)^2}{(2 \\pi)^5 } \\ ,      \\frac{m^2}{4 p e } \\ , \\ ,    \\overline { |{\\cal m}|^2 }      \\ , \\ , \\rho ( t_{lab } )   \\ , ,   \\label{cross }   \\\\   \\overline { |{\\cal m}|^2 } & = & \\frac{1}{4 }     \\sum_{\\lambda_1^{\\ , \\prime } , \\lambda_1 , \\lambda_2^{\\ , \\prime } , \\lambda_2 }     { \\cal m}_{\\lambda_1^{\\ , \\prime } \\lambda_1 , \\lambda_2^{\\ , \\prime } \\lambda_2 }        \\ , \\ ,   { \\cal m}^*_{\\lambda_1^{\\ , \\prime } \\lambda_1 , \\lambda_2^{\\ , \\prime } \\lambda_2 }           \\ ,   , \\label{amp } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24  is the nucleon mass ; @xmath25  are the relative momentum and energy in the initial state ; @xmath26  is the phase space density , @xmath27  is the kinetic energy of the incoming proton .",
    "the amplitude @xmath22  and the phase space density @xmath28  have dimensions mev@xmath29 , and mev@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the helicity transition amplitude @xmath31 is calculated from the feynman rules as defined in @xcite . for the partial waves considered ,",
    "there is only one independent helicity amplitude , @xmath32 , with @xmath33  being the @xmath20  phase shift .",
    "the @xmath2-interactions @xcite used in our calculations were fitted to @xmath34-data and the effect of the coulomb interaction is not included .",
    "it would suppress the cross section at threshold by about @xmath35 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that using a constant amplitude in ( [ cross ] ) results in a roughly quadratic dependence of @xmath12  on @xmath27 , clearly at variance with the experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the most pronounced energy dependence of the total transition amplitude comes from the energy dependence of the final state @xmath21  interaction .",
    "we deal with it in an approximate way similar to that employed in @xcite : we assume that the energy dependence of the final state scattering matrix is well approximated by the energy dependence of the corresponding on - shell @xmath2 scattering matrix @xmath36 , @xmath37 expressing @xmath38  in terms of the @xmath21 phase - shift @xmath39 and @xmath40  in terms of the singlet scattering length @xmath41 , one obtains @xmath42 with @xmath43  being the relative momentum and energy of the final @xmath4  state . accordingly , the square of the transition amplitude contains the energy - dependent factor @xmath44 we introduce it into ( [ cross ] ) by replacing @xmath45    the difference between @xmath46  and @xmath47  is illustrated in fig .",
    "the approximation introduced in ( [ mmat ] ) implies for the heitler @xmath48-matrix @xmath49 .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates the quality of this assumption about the energy dependence of the off - shell @xmath48-matrices .",
    "the curves corresponding to different energies would coincide in case the factorization describing the energy dependence of the half - off - shell nn amplitudes @xmath50 were exact .",
    "we note that we did not employ the effective range approximation for the final state scattering amplitude as it was used in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to artificially increase the cross section . since the approximation ( [ mmat ] ) allows for a very good description of the energy dependence of the data , it can be used to extract the value of the threshold amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "a fit to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite yields a value @xmath52 which is to be compared with our calculations summarized in table [ t1 ] .",
    "a similar fit employing the unmodified phase space density with an unrealistic energy dependence of the cross section leads to a much smaller value @xmath53   mev@xmath29 .",
    "table [ t1 ] shows in detail the contributions of diagrams ( a)-(c ) for several models that differ in their off - shell parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the best fit to the @xmath2  data was obtained @xcite by models with @xmath16  in the range @xmath54 . from the models listed in the table , the one with @xmath55 yields the triton binding energy closest to its experimental value @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes are , in general , complex numbers , but we can subtract the two contributions from diagram ( c ) which correspond to having both intermediate nucleons on - shell either before or after pion is emitted , and add them to the amplitudes of diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively",
    ". then we arrive at new partial amplitudes that can be written as real numbers ( which are given in table [ t1 ] ) times a common phase factor .",
    "however , one has to be cautious when comparing to other calculations that present results for the original diagrams . at threshold ,",
    "the final state phase shift is zero and in terms of the real numbers @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58the actual partial amplitudes are given as @xmath59 the upper part of the table presents results of our covariant calculations .",
    "diagram ( c ) dominates at threshold .",
    "our results show a moderate dependence on the parameter @xmath16 and we observe that the amplitudes for the models with nonzero @xmath16   are somewhat enhanced .",
    "the largest value , at @xmath60 , is about 20 % larger than the smallest at @xmath61 .",
    "this translates into a more than 40 % variation in the total cross section .",
    "although in itself it represents a sizeable effect , it is at this point not clear how much of it will survive in more complete calculations that would include other , model - dependent reaction mechanisms ( such as that of diagram ( d ) ) .",
    "our total result is 2 - 3 times smaller than the fitted amplitude ( [ aexp ] ) for all models .",
    "the relativistic @xmath2 potentials @xcite contain form factors for off - shell nucleons ( sometimes called `` sideways '' form factors ) . for consistency we include them also in the pion emission vertex .",
    "they decrease the results by up to 10 % ( see table [ t1 ] ) . for reference and for comparison with perturbative results",
    "the total results without these form factors are also given ( line `` no n ffs ' ' ) .",
    "the nucleon form factors are not included in our perturbative transition operators .",
    "it is difficult to take them into account consistently in @xmath15- expansion approaches , and the usual @xmath2 potentials and pion emission operators never consider them .",
    "the last three lines of table [ t1 ] list the usual perturbative results obtained with the same nucleon wave functions and with the meson parameters and meson - nucleon form factors consistent with the @xmath2 interaction employed .",
    "the first line gives the perturbative ia , to be compared with the subtotal @xmath62   of covariant results .",
    "the perturbative result is somewhat larger , the difference between these numbers is due to the @xmath15-decomposition in the one - nucleon operator at threshold ( in the covariant description it contains a factor @xmath63  compared to @xmath64 in the perturbative one ) and to the presence of the off - shell nucleon form factors in the relativistic calculations .",
    "the perturbative contribution of the z - diagrams given in the second last line is to be compared to the sum of all terms with negative energy nucleon(s ) in intermediate states : @xmath65 .",
    "we see that the perturbative result is more than 3 times as large as the covariant one .",
    "notice also that the perturbative results would reproduce very well the experimental amplitude ( [ aexp ] ) , though one should recall that coulomb effects would suppress the cross section at threshold by about 40 % .",
    "we do not consider here the model - dependent pion - production mechanisms , e.g. , the pion - rescattering , and the @xmath66  diagram introduced in ref .",
    "they can easily contribute by the same amount as the model independent nucleon born diagrams considered so far .",
    "however , care should be taken to include them in a way consistent with the dynamics of the @xmath2-interaction .    in conclusion ,",
    "the sensitive cross section of @xmath0   production seems to be an ideal place to look for effects of relativistic dynamics .",
    "our exploratory studies reported in this letter indeed lead to an assessment of the importance of `` z - diagrams '' different from the traditional nonrelativistic ones .",
    "our main conclusion is that such diagrams , when included in a non - perturbative way , contribute differently than their non - relativistic limits taken perturbatively .",
    "a similar effect was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the elastic electron scattering on deuteron , but there it becomes noticeable at a momentum transfer @xmath67gev .",
    "our present calculations in relativistic impulse approximation underestimate the data . in future calculations we plan to go beyond the threshold approximations and include pion rescattering contributions .",
