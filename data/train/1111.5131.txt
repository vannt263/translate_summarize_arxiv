    "this phenomenon has received much attention , due to its potential applications in secure communication @xcite . for technological applications semi - conductor lasers are promising systems to implement secure communication schemes using chaos synchronization , because they exhibit fast dynamics , they are cheap and one could utilize the existing telecommunication infrastructure for these lasers @xcite .",
    "however , due to the fast dynamics of the lasers , propagation distances of already a few meters introduce non - negligible delay times in the coupling .",
    "the synchronization of delay - coupled systems in general @xcite and in particular delay - coupled lasers @xcite has thus been a focus of research in nonlinear dynamics during the last decades .",
    "when the lasers are coupled all - optically , not only delay effects are important , but also the optical coupling phases of the coherently coupled electric fields play an important role . coherent coupling may result in constructive or destructive interference of incoming signals .",
    "when the lasers are synchronized , this interference can occur even if the coupling distance is much larger than the coherence length of the beams @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally and numerically that by tuning coupling phases one can adjust the level of synchronization ranging from perfect synchronization to almost no correlation @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of these coupling phases and the resulting interference conditions have so far not been thoroughly investigated .    in this work",
    "we derive and discuss synchronization conditions for all - optically coupled lasers .",
    "these conditions ensure the existence and stability of a completely synchronized solution , i.e. , perfect synchronization of identical lasers .",

    "on one hand , there has been some recent progress in addressing parameter mismatch within the framework @xcite and it might be interesting to apply these new methods to the laser system .",
    "on the other hand , slight perturbations of the perfect setup are also related to the question whether the synchronization manifold is normally hyperbolic @xcite .",

( [ eq : motifd : finalc1 ] ) ) is fulfilled .",
    "the lasers exhibit strong synchronization on this curve .",
    "for this motif , the row sum @xmath11 and the transversal eigenvalue @xmath162 depend on the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath174 . due to this dependence , the synchronization condition c3 is not satisfied everywhere on the dotted line and identical synchronization is only stable on parts of the curve .",
    "additionally , we again have the effect of multistability as discussed for the last two motifs , which can result in low synchronization probability on the dotted curve .",
    "( motif ( d ) ) synchronization probability @xmath89 ( left ) and correlation coefficient @xmath115 ( right ) as a function of @xmath99 and @xmath174 .",

    "other parameters : @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath142 . ]",
    "similarly to the case of motif ( c ) , the relative phase shift @xmath65 can be found by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : motifd : e1 ] ) for @xmath133 @xmath179 and using the definition of @xmath151 .",
    "this phase shift can then be used in condition c2 and c3 ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : motifd : c2 ] ) and ( [ eq : motifd : c3 ] ) ) .    in order for eq .",
    "( [ eq : motifd : finalc1 ] ) to have a solution , the two vectors with respective lengths @xmath139 and @xmath180 have to be able to reach the ellipse , i.e. , the sum of the magnitudes @xmath181 has to be larger or equal to the length of the semi - minor axis @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , the absolute value of the magnitude difference @xmath182 has to be smaller or equal to the length of the semi - major axis @xmath183 .",
    "we thus obtain two conditions for the existence of a solution @xmath184 if and only if the coupling strengths fulfill eqs .",
    "( [ eq : motifd : kcond ] ) , there is a combination of phases such that condition ( [ eq : motifd : finalc1 ] ) is satisfied .    in many optical setups the forward and backward directions have approximately equal coupling strengths @xmath185",
    "this holds for instance for a setup where the lasers are coupled via a common mirror ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : commonmirror ] ) or where the lasers are coupled face - to - face . in this case",
    "the ellipse becomes a line along the @xmath186-axis stretching from @xmath187 to @xmath188 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq : motifd : finalc1 ] ) reduces to @xmath189 with the supplementary condition @xmath190 .",
    "we now move from the two - laser system to networks of @xmath0 all - optically coupled lasers .",
    "the synchronization of laser networks is on one hand important for applications for instance in high power laser arrays , where the synchronization of optical phases yields an intensity @xmath191 for interfering beams in contrast to the case of randomly distributed phases that gives @xmath192 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "laser networks have been proposed as optical information processing systems @xcite .",
    "understanding stability properties of dynamical states in these networks is a necessary first step for controlling and utilizing these systems .    for a network of @xmath0",
    "all - optically coupled lasers , the coupling terms in the lang - kobayashi rate equations are given by @xmath193 here @xmath194 and @xmath48 are matrices describing the coupling strength and coupling phase , respectively , of the connection @xmath195 .",
    "again the lasers may synchronize with relative phase shifts @xmath196 , which we define with respect to laser  1 @xmath197 i.e. , @xmath198 . performing the corresponding transformation ( as before in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) ) @xmath199 and omitting the tildas for simplicity we obtain the field equations @xmath200 the necessary condition c1 for synchronization is then stated as follows : there exists an invariant synchronization manifold if and only if there is a combination of relative phases @xmath196 ( @xmath201 ) , such that the complex row sum @xmath202 is independent of @xmath3 . as we saw before , this condition is already very difficult to analyze for two lasers when all four connections are present . in an experiment",
    "it may be possible to actively control two or three phases accurately using for instance piezo positioning of mirrors , or passive wave - guides where the optical path - lengths can be controlled through an injection current @xcite .",
    "however , it is virtually impossible to actively control more than a few phases in this way . for larger networks , optoelectronic @xcite , incoherent optical feedback @xcite or coupling via a common relay @xcite",
    "may thus be a more promising coupling method .",
    "however , in certain cases all - optical coupling may be feasible in an experimental situation .",
    "we discuss such a feasible setup below .    to illustrate the complexity of the synchronization condition c1 in a simple case , we consider a system of bidirectionally coupled lasers .",
    "for rings of bi - directionally coupled lasers , the coupling matrix has the following principal structure    @xmath203 \\;,\\ ] ]    with @xmath204 .",
    "we then obtain the following row sums @xmath205 the necessary synchronization condition c1 then corresponds to @xmath206 equations ( each complex equation yields two real equations ) @xmath207 however , there are only @xmath208 relative phases @xmath209 ( @xmath198 ) that the system can choose freely .",
    "thus , in an experiment we need to control @xmath208 coupling phases to satisfy the synchronization condition c1 . for",
    "a ring of @xmath210 elements , controlling two coupling phases may still be feasible , but this approach quickly fails for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we will now discuss one promising all - optical setup that should , in principle , be robust to phase mismatches . consider the setup @xcite sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : networkmirror ] .",
    "the laser fields are coupled into a common fiber , which is terminated by a mirror .",
    "as before , we assume that the coupling delays are equal ( the light paths are equally long on a cm scale ) , but allow for coupling phases , i.e. , differences in optical path - lengths on wavelength scales .        in this setup , the connection from each laser  @xmath3 to the mirror corresponds to a certain optical path length with a corresponding phase @xmath211 .",
    "the coupling phase from laser  @xmath212 to laser  @xmath3 is then given by @xmath213 similarly , the connection from each laser to the mirror has an associated coupling strength @xmath214 , which could in an experiment be controlled by an attenuator in the corresponding fiber .",
    "the coupling from laser  @xmath212 to laser  @xmath3 then has an effective coupling strength @xmath215    under these conditions ,",
    "the row sum is given by @xmath216 the sum on the right hand side is a complex number independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the row sum condition can thus be satisfied if the prefactor is also independent of @xmath3 , i.e. , all coupling strengths are equal ( @xmath217 ) and the relative phases @xmath196 are chosen by the system to give . ]",
    "@xmath218 in essence , all lasers couple to the optical mean field and compensate for the difference in optical path length of their individual fiber by adjusting their relative phase shift . as long as the setup obeys eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phasesum ] ) and ( [ eq : couplingsum ] ) , the coupling phases @xmath211 may vary , e.g. , due to thermal effects , and do not need to be controlled .",
    "assuming that all coupling strengths are equal and the relative phases @xmath196 are tuned appropriately by the system the coupling matrix is given by @xmath219 this matrix has one eigenvalue corresponding to the row sum @xmath220 and the @xmath208 transversal eigenvalues are zero @xmath221 such that this setup is optimal for synchronization .",
    "recently , this coupling scheme has been proposed for optical information processing using multi - mode lasers @xcite . for multi - mode lasers , the same argument as above holds for each mode , such that the setup is , in principle , robust to phase mismatches .",
    "however , it may still be difficult to realize the assumptions eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasesum ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : couplingsum ] ) in an experimental setup .",
    "we have discussed chaos synchronization conditions for all - optically coupled lasers . in all - optical coupling",
    ", the coupling phases play a crucial role for the synchronizability .",
    "the condition of constant row sum corresponds to specific interference conditions , i.e. , the input signals of each laser should interfere in such a way that each laser receives the same input signal , relative to its own phase .",
    "this corresponds to the existence of an identical synchronization manifold . through interference",
    ", the phases may compensate for mismatches in the coupling strengths .    using these interference arguments",
    "we have explained experimental findings @xcite and discussed necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization of all network motifs which contain two all - optically coupled lasers .",
    "further , we have considered synchronization of larger laser networks , and singled out the difficulties that arise in all - optical coupling schemes due to the interference conditions .",
    "we predict that a setup of all - to - all coupling via a common mirror may under certain conditions be robust to phase mismatches and thus be optimal with respect to stability of the synchronized chaotic dynamics .    in a broader context",
    ", these results might also be relevant for other networks where phase - sensitive couplings play a role , e.g. , networks of stuart - landau oscillators with complex coupling constants @xmath222 @xcite .",
