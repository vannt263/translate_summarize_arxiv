    "an eigenstate expansion is limited to a relatively small bridge including only few vibrational modes .",
    "thus , the approach developed in this paper has to be extended and optimized to apply it to large molecular bridges .",
    "therefore , the method developed in this work and the conventional negf - based theories of heat transport are independent and complementary . a major improvement in the theory of heat transport through nanojunctions can thus be expected if the two methods are combined , allowing the simultaneous treatment of weakly and highly anharmonic modes of the same nanojunction by anharmonic perturbation theory and exact diagonalization methods , respectively .",
