    "the ring fragments into multiple supercritical cores in the presence of density fluctuations during the isothermal collapse phase @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the core - forming clouds and show that these clouds become unstable to bar formation after the supercritical core formation over a wide range of initial model parameters . the subsequent evolution and fragmentation of the bar",
    "are discussed in  [ sec : fragmentation ] .      to begin with",
    ", we consider a non - rotating ( @xmath46 ) cloud with the reference state specified by the set of parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the cloud is therefore magnetically subcritical , with the field strength @xmath50 above the critical value at the center .",
    "the cloud so specified produces a dense supercritical core in the absence of any non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "the reference cloud is allowed to evolve into an equilibrium configuration , with the magnetic field frozen - in . after the equilibrium is reached , we reset the time to @xmath28 , turn on ambipolar diffusion , and add an @xmath0 perturbation to the surface density distribution , with a fractional amplitude of @xmath51 .",
    "the evolution of such a non - axisymmetrically perturbed cloud is followed numerically to progressively higher densities and smaller scales .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and described as follows .",
    "the evolution of the model is qualitatively similar to that of the model shown in fig . 1 of @xcite , where a different reference density distribution ( less centrally - condensed than the model shown in this subsection ) is adopted .",
    "the evolution is followed to a higher density here .",
    "as is usual with ambipolar diffusion - driven evolution , the cloud spends most of its time in the subcritical phase when the dimensionless minimum flux - to - mass ratio ( at the density peak ) is greater than unity , @xmath52 ( see panels [ a ] and [ b ] of fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . during this period ,",
    "gas motions are very subsonic and the central part of the cloud oscillates with a small amplitude .",
    "the oscillation indicates that the cloud is stable to the @xmath0 perturbation during the subcritical phase , in agreement with linear analysis by nakano ( 1988 ) and others .",
    "indeed , we have verified numerically that for a frozen - in field the subcritical cloud remains stable to this and other higher ( e.g. , @xmath53 ) modes .",
    "( we followed the evolution of the frozen - in model for several periods of oscillation and confirmed that the cloud oscillates with almost the same amplitude as the initial . )",
    "once the minimum flux - to - mass ratio has dropped below the critical value , the contraction becomes dynamic and the infall speed eventually exceeds the sound speed at the center ( see panels [ c ] and [ d ] ) . by the time shown in panel ( c ) , the @xmath0 mode has grown significantly , resulting in a bar - like core at the center with an aspect ratio of roughly 2 .",
    "the bar growth remains relatively modest ( panel [ d ] ) until the very end of the runaway collapse , when the growth rate increases dramatically ( panel [ e ] ) . beyond a dimensionless critical surface density of @xmath54 ,",
    "corresponding to a volume density of @xmath55 @xmath3 , we change the equation of state from isothermal to adiabatic , with an index of 5/3 , to mimic the transition to optically thick regime of cloud evolution .",
    "when the maximum surface density reaches @xmath56 , the contraction along the minor axis of the bar decelerates significantly and an accretion shock is formed at the surface of the bar .",
    "this shock - bound bar is analogous to the `` first core '' of spherical calculations , and will be referred to as the `` first bar '' below . immediately after the shock formation , the aspect ratio of the first bar continues to increase .",
    "it reaches a maximum of about 10 by the time shown in panel ( e ) .",
    "thereafter , the infall along the major axis becomes significant , forming a round core at the center .",
    "the aspect ratio of the central round core approaches unity as the collapse proceeds . since the round core resembles the first core of the spherical calculations , we call it the `` truly first core '' . as will be shown in ",
    "[ sec : fragmentation ] , this round core evolves into a rapidly - rotating disk in the presence of an initial , slow cloud rotation .    to quantify the geometrical change of the supercritical core , we plot in figure [ fig:2 ] the aspect ratio of the darkest region in figure [ fig:1 ] ( with @xmath57 ) as a function of the maximum surface density , @xmath58 , together with the flux - to - mass - ratio @xmath59 at the center .",
    "the aspect ratio is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , respectively , the effective scale heights along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axes , and evaluated as @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total mass in the region with @xmath66 . during the subcritical phase , the aspect ratio of the bar does not grow in time ; it oscillates around unity , signifying that the subcritical cloud is stable to the @xmath0 mode .",
    "as the central region becomes more and more supercritical , the bar mode begins to grow significantly . during this supercritical period , the aspect ratio of the bar stays more or less frozen at @xmath67 before the central density reaches @xmath68 .",
    "this freezing of aspect ratio is related to the dynamical state of the disk . as shown in ",
    "[ subsec : why ] , the mass of the central flat region is merely @xmath69 1.5 times the effective jeans mass ( as measured by the central surface density , including the magnetic contribution ) .",
    "such a relatively low - mass disk is only marginally unstable to the non - axisymmetric perturbation .",
    "in other words , the time scale of bar growth is comparable to that of dynamic contraction .",
    "the flux - to - mass ratio does not change much either during this period , as a result of the rapid collapse which prevents the magnetic flux from leaking out significantly .",
    "the bar growth speeds up toward the very end of the supercritical collapse when the mass of the central flat region exceeds about twice the effective jeans mass .",
    "it continues after the first bar formation . when the central surface density reaches @xmath70 , the infall motion along the major axis of the bar becomes significant and the aspect ratio begins to drop steeply to unity , forming the truly first core .    to study the structure of the bar , we show in figure [ fig:3 ] the distributions of the surface density , magnetic field , and infall velocity along the axes as a function of the distance from the density maximum , at seven different times .",
    "the solid and dashed curves indicate the distributions of the physical quantities along the major ( @xmath12 ) and minor ( @xmath11 ) axes , respectively . during the early phase of supercritical collapse when the aspect ratio of the bar is frozen at @xmath67 ,",
    "the surface density distributions along both axes qualitatively resemble the self - similar distribution of the axisymmetric collapse ; they are flat near the density maximum and can be approximated by a power - law of @xmath71 at the magnetically supercritical envelope , where @xmath72 is the distance from the density peak .",
    "the @xmath71 distribution corresponds to a volume density distribution of @xmath73 because of the force balance in the vertical direction ( which yields @xmath74 ) . while the central density increases rapidly , the surface density distributions change little in the envelope .",
    "the central flat region shrinks in size in accordance with the increase in the central density .",
    "the distributions of the vertical field @xmath33 are qualitatively similar to those of @xmath75 in the magnetically supercritical region and almost proportional to the local surface density ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the @xmath11- and @xmath12-components of the magnetic field ( in the disk plane ) increase approximately linearly with distance @xmath72 in the central flat region , peaking near the edge of the flat region , before falling off as @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the magnetically supercritical envelope , @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "are comparable to @xmath33 , indicating that the field lines near the disk plane incline with an angle of @xmath69 45 degree with respect to the disk plane .",
    "the angle approaches @xmath81 degree in the outer , magnetically subcritical envelope .",
    "the infall speeds are proportional to the distance @xmath72 near the center , becoming more or less flat in the supercritical part of the envelope , before falling to subsonic values in the outer subcritical envelope . at @xmath82 ,",
    "the infall speeds in the supercritical envelope reach @xmath83 .    as",
    "the collapse proceeds and the bar aspect ratio becomes large , the distributions of physical quantities gradually deviate from the self - similar distributions .",
    "for example , the surface density and vertical magnetic field ( @xmath33 ) profiles along the major axis become steeper as the bar elongates rapidly .",
    "when the central surface density reaches @xmath84 , a shock is formed at @xmath85 .",
    "thereafter , the infall speed rises in the envelope of the bar .",
    "the infall speed along the minor axis follows @xmath86 just outside the first bar , indicating a free - fall collapse towards the bar .",
    "interestingly , after the bar becomes opaque to dust emission , a local density peak is formed at each end of the first bar .",
    "this density peak formation is due to the `` edge '' effect , which was first calculated by @xcite and then extensively investigated by @xcite and @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the density peaks do not grow nonlinearly ; they tend to disappear in the subsequent collapse because the central truly first core grows more rapidly in mass owing to the supersonic infall along the major axis , which dominates the gravitational potential in the high density region . in  [ sec : fragmentation ] , we show that for more massive clouds in which the aspect ratios of the supercritical cores are larger , the density peaks _ can _ grow in time because the infall speeds along the major axis remain subsonic .",
    "the model discussed in this subsection serves as a standard against which other models will be compared .",
    "the properties of the bar growth depend on the initial model parameters . here",
    ", we investigate the effects of the initial flux - to - mass ratio @xmath87 , the characteristic radius @xmath34 , and the density profile parameter @xmath25 for non - rotating clouds .",
    "the effect of rotation is examined in separate subsections  [ subsec : rotation ] and  [ subsec : separate core ] .",
    "exact values of @xmath44 are difficult to determine observationally ; they probably lie within a factor of two of unity @xcite , after correcting for likely projection effects @xcite .",
    "thus , we investigated the dependence on @xmath87 in the range of @xmath88 .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath34 is to be compared with @xmath89 , the ( dimensionless ) critical wavelength for the ( thermal ) jeans instability in a disk of uniform mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 controls the profile of the cloud surface density distribution ; those with smaller values of @xmath25 are more centrally peaked .    to examine the effect of the initial flux - to - mass ratio @xmath44 , we first hold the cloud radius and profile parameter fixed at the standard values @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and reduce the flux - to - mass ratio @xmath87 .",
    "representative results are shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , at a time when the maximum surface density @xmath90 .",
    "panel ( a ) is the snapshot of a cloud with @xmath91 ( a weaker initial magnetic field ) , perturbed by an @xmath0 mode of the standard fractional amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "comparison with panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where the standard case at the same @xmath58 is plotted shows that a weaker magnetic field promotes the bar growth . this slower bar growth in the stronger field case",
    "is quantitatively shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ fig:2 ] ( compare the solid curve with the dotted - dashed curve ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior appears to be that , for the cloud with a stronger initial magnetic field , the magnetic support remains more important even in the supercritical phase . in other words ,",
    "the averaged flux - to - mass ratio in the darkest region ( @xmath92 ) is larger for the stronger field model .",
    "the stronger field tends to retard the deformation of the supercritical core .",
    "we have confirmed this negative effect of the magnetic field on bar growth by following the evolution of the clouds with @xmath93 and 3 .",
    "we next consider the effect of the characteristic radius @xmath34 which controls the total cloud mass . increasing the radius @xmath34",
    "is expected to have a positive effect on bar growth .",
    "this is indeed the case , as illustrated in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where the snapshot of a cloud with @xmath94 , 1.5 times the standard value , is shown at @xmath95 .",

    "the profile parameter @xmath25 has an effect similar to the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , a reduction in @xmath25 would decrease the number of jeans masses contained in the central plateau region .",
    "we showed in a previous paper @xcite that for the ring - forming case , the clouds with more peaked density profiles are less prone to fragmentation .",
    "this negative effect of the centrally condensed density distribution is also observed for non - magnetized clouds @xcite .",
    "we find the same trend for the core - forming clouds as well .",
    "the aspect ratio of the bar increases more rapidly for larger @xmath25 .",
    "this is illustrated in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where @xmath97 , twice the standard value , is chosen .",
    "the bar is more elongated than the standard case , even though the characteristic radius @xmath98 is only half of the standard value .      to gauge the effect of slow rotation , we repeat the evolution of a cloud with all parameters identical to those of the standard model in  [ subsec : norotation ] except the rotation parameter @xmath24 , which is now set to @xmath99 instead of zero . snapshots of the surface density distribution and velocity field at three selected times are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the general trend of the cloud evolution is similar to that in the non - rotating case ; in the subcritical phase , the cloud is stable to non - axisymmetric perturbations and the @xmath0 mode begins to grow in time only after the central region becomes magnetically supercritical .",
    "comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig:1]d and fig",
    ".  [ fig:5]b indicates a beneficial effect of the slow rotation on the bar growth .",
    "more quantitatively , the aspect ratio of the bar is always larger for the rotating cloud at the time when the maximum density reaches the same value , before the bar becomes opaque to dust emission .",
    "this effect derives from the fact that rotation retards the radial infall , which allows more time for perturbations to grow .",
    "in  [ subsec : separate core ] below , we will show that the slow - down effect due to rotation plays a dramatic role in the cloud fragmentation for more rapidly - rotating , less centrally - condensed clouds , which can fragment into two cores during the isothermal collapse phase soon after the supercritical core formation .",
    "the bar growth is closely related to the dynamical state of the supercritical core . in this subsection , to clarify the physics of the bar growth , we follow the evolution of unperturbed axisymmetric clouds with the one - dimensional code and measure the dynamical forces in the supercritical cores . for simplicity , we do not change the equation of state for the one - dimensional calculations even when the surface density exceeds the critical value of @xmath54 .",
    "previous axisymmetric calculations of ambipolar diffusion - driven cloud evolution have shown that the collapse of supercritical cores proceeds self - similarly : the distributions of the surface density and magnetic field are almost constant in the central flat region and decrease with radius as @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xcite . in the high density region of the supercritical core ,",
    "the decrease of the flux - to - mass ratio levels off ( at @xmath102 ) due to the rapid dynamic collapse which prevents significant magnetic flux leakage .",
    "this is shown in panels ( a ) and ( c ) of figure [ fig:1d ] , where the flux - to - mass ratio normalized by the critical value is depicted as a function of radius for two representative models . @xcite and @xcite called such a cloud with a constant flux - to - mass ratio `` isopedic '' . in the isopedic cloud , the gravity ( @xmath103 ) and gas pressure ( @xmath104 ) are proportional to the magnetic tension ( @xmath105 ) and pressure ( @xmath106 ) , respectively @xcite , where @xmath107 is the half thickness of the disk ( see eq . [ 5 ] of @xcite for the definition of @xmath107 ) .",
    "in fact , the supercritical cores have such a characteristic .",
    "figure [ fig:1d ] shows the evolution of the ratio of the effective gravity to the effective pressure at six different times for two models . here ,",
    "the effective pressure and gravity are defined as @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively . at the initial state ( @xmath28 ) , this ratio is equal to unity , indicating a force balance in the initial cloud . as the collapse proceeds , this ratio increases due to ambipolar diffusion , which reduces the magnetic support in the central high density region .",
    "when the central surface density is in the range of @xmath110 , the effective gravity is larger than the effective pressure , but only by a factor of about 1.5 @xmath111 2 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass of the central flat region only about 1.5 @xmath111 2 times the effective jeans mass .",
    "such a relatively low - mass core is only marginally unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations , which is probably the reason why the aspect ratio of the bar remains almost frozen at a modest value of @xmath112 in the presence of an @xmath0 perturbation .",
    "when the force ratio exceeds @xmath113 , the bar growth is accelerated remarkably by the lin - mestel - shu type gravitational instability @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for both clouds ,",

    "this behavior suggests that the isothermal evolution tends toward a self - similar solution .",

    "@xcite constructed a self - similar collapse model including the effect of ambipolar diffusion [ see @xcite for the self - similar collapse after the protostellar core formation ] .",
    "the behavior of his solution is in good agreement with that of @xcite in the late , self - similar phase of dynamic collapse , when the effective gravity is about @xmath114 times the effective pressure force and the asymptotic velocity is about twice the effective sound speed .",
    "@xcite investigated the dynamical stability of the self - similar solution to non - axisymmetric perturbations and found that the self - similar solution is unstable to the @xmath0 mode and stable to the higher modes .",
    "this characteristic is consistent with the numerical results presented in the previous subsections .",
    "thus , we conclude that the tendency for the supercritical collapse to approach the gravity - dominated self - similar solution is responsible for the bar formation during the dynamic collapse .",
    "in  [ sec : results ] , we demonstrated that initially magnetically subcritical clouds tend to be unstable to an @xmath0 mode , forming bar - like cores . in this section",
    ", we investigate the subsequent evolution of the bar mode and show that the elongated supercritical cores can break up into discrete fragments .",
    "we classify the fragmentation process into three types , depending on the initial model parameters : ( 1 ) _ separate core formation _ , in which the @xmath0 mode breaks up into two separate cores in the isothermal collapse phase , ( 2 ) _ bar fragmentation _ ,",
    "in which the first bar breaks up into multiple fragments that move mainly along the major axis of the bar , with frequent merging among the fragments , and ( 3 ) _ disk fragmentation _ , in which the central region evolves into a rapidly - rotating disk where another bar mode is excited , fragmenting into blobs . in the following ,",
    "we select three models to illustrate the salient features of these cases .",
    "in  [ subsec : rotation ] , we showed that rotation slows down the dynamic collapse , allowing more time for perturbations to grow . here , we demonstrate that a relatively fast rotation can affect the outcome of cloud evolution dramatically , particularly for @xmath115 clouds whose initial parameter range is intermediate between those for core - forming and ring - forming clouds in the axisymmetric calculations @xcite .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] show the snapshots of the surface density distribution and velocity field at two selected times for the model with @xmath97 , @xmath116 , @xmath98 , and @xmath49 .",
    "this cloud is categorized as a core - forming cloud from the axisymmetric one - dimensional calculation .",
    "a cloud larger in radius by only a few tens of percent would collapse to form a ring instead of a single core . for comparison ,",
    "the snapshot of a more slowly rotating cloud with @xmath117 is shown in panel ( a ) at the time when @xmath118 .",
    "the model with @xmath117 shows the evolution qualitatively similar to the model in  [ subsec : rotation ] , i.e. , after the supercritical core formation , a bar mode grows in time without fragmentation . on the other hand , when the rotation rate is doubled ( @xmath119 )",
    ", the bar grows more rapidly even at the early time shown in panel ( b ) , when the maximum surface density reaches 10 . by this time , the entire bar ( the darkest part in panel [ b ] ) becomes magnetically supercritical . by the time shown in panel ( c ) ( @xmath120 ) , the @xmath0 mode breaks up into two separate cores , each of which continues to collapse dynamically .",
    "( we checked that this model is stable to higher @xmath121 modes . )",
    "the subsequent evolution of each core is qualitatively similar to that of the models shown in the previous section , i.e. , the aspect ratio of each core is more or less frozen at @xmath122 2 during the early phase of supercritical collapse , and increases rapidly at the very end of the supercritical collapse .    for the separate core formation case",
    ", the magnetic field has a positive effect on the fragmentation .",
    "we calculated the models of a weaker and a stronger magnetic field for the same set of parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath119 , and @xmath51 , and found that the cloud with a weaker magnetic field does not break up into two cores ( it collapses into a single bar instead ) , whereas the cloud with a stronger magnetic field fragments into two cores at a lower density and with a wider separation .",
    "more centrally - condensed clouds with @xmath48 and @xmath123 do not fragment into two cores even in the presence of a rapid rotation ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "these dependences on @xmath44 and @xmath25 are the same as those of the multiple fragmentation case investigated by @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the separate core case is similar to the multiple fragmentation case , although the bar fragmentation into two cores appears to depend more strongly on the rotation rate .    at the time shown in panel ( c ) ,",
    "the separation of two cores is about a tenth of the initial cloud radius , which corresponds to @xmath125 au with the fiducial choice of @xmath126 g @xmath127 and @xmath128 k. this separate core formation case may thus be responsible for the formation of wide binaries with separations of the order of @xmath1 au , although substantial orbital evolution is likely after the initial fragmentation , since the cores are not kept apart by rotation .",
    "to summarize , when the initial rotation is relatively fast and the density distribution in the central region is relatively flat , the @xmath0 mode can break up into two separate cores in the isothermal collapse phase after the central region becomes supercritical ( e.g. , for @xmath97 , @xmath129 0.2 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 ) .",
    "we note that this separate core formation differs from that found previously for non - magnetic clouds , which requires a rapid rotation or highly unstable initial condition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "the cloud is initially stable to gravitational collapse , and the fragmentation is induced by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "indeed , we find that clouds with relatively weak magnetic fields do not fragment into separate cores during the isothermal collapse phase .",
    "according to linear perturbation theory , long filamentary clouds tend to break up gravitationally into fragments if their lengths exceed several times the diameter .",
    "this is indeed the case for the first bars formed in relatively massive , centrally - condensed clouds ( with a relatively large @xmath34 and @xmath132 , e.g. , for @xmath48 , @xmath130 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , where the snapshots of a cloud with @xmath48 , @xmath135 , @xmath94 , and @xmath119 are shown at three different times . in this model , fragmentation starts when the bar becomes opaque to dust emission , which retards the radial contraction ( at @xmath136 ) . at first , the bar produces two dense fragments near the center at @xmath137 , and then the fragmentation apparently propagates towards the ends of the bar .",
    "this apparent propagation of the fragmentation is due to the fact that the growth rate of the gravitational fragmentation is larger for the higher density region closer to the center . by the time shown in panel ( a )",
    ", there is a fragment formed at each of the two ends of the bar .",
    "this density peak formation at the end was first noticed by @xcite and subsequently investigated extensively by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is caused by a local minimum in the gravitational potential .",
    "the masses of the fragments formed by bar fragmentation are on the order of @xmath138 .",
    "these masses agree with those expected from the linear theory of fragmentation of cylindrical clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by the time shown in panel ( b ) , the two pairs of fragments near the center have merged to produce one , more massive , pair .",
    "this process of successive bar fragmentation and subsequent merging is repeated , as shown in panel ( c ) , where the two most massive fragments are about to merge at the center .",
    "we will discuss further the evolution of this multiple fragment system in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we note that bar fragmentation was also observed in the numerical simulations of non - magnetic cloud collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the non - magnetic bars are typically much shorter than the one presented in this subsection .",
    "to form such a long bar in the non - magnetic case , the initial cloud must contain many thermal jeans masses and thus be highly unstable . in our case , the initial cloud is stablized by a strong magnetic field , whose support weakens with time as a result of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "@xcite studied bar formation in clouds with frozen - in magnetic fields .",
    "they found bars that are prone to gravitational breakup according to the linear theory of fragmentation .",
    "these bars are however shorter than the one discussed here .",
    "they are expected to produce a smaller number of fragments .",
    "when the initial clouds are centrally condensed and/or less massive ( e.g. , for @xmath48 , @xmath139 , @xmath130 , and @xmath140 ) , the length of the bar does not exceed the critical wavelength for gravitational fragmentation by the time of first bar formation .",
    "it would be difficult for such a short bar to break up into blobs gravitationally . in this case , a rapidly - rotating disk is formed in the presence of slow rotation . here , we show an example of the rotating disk formation . figure [ fig:8 ] shows the snapshots at six different times of a model with @xmath48 , @xmath135 , @xmath98 , and @xmath141 , which is identical to the slowly rotating model discussed in  [ subsec : rotation ] , except for a smaller characteristic radius @xmath34 ( @xmath142 instead of @xmath143 ) . for comparison , the linear density contours of the central disk",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] at three selected times . in this model",
    ", the bar mode does not grow much by the end of isothermal collapse because of the relatively small cloud radius @xmath34 times the effective jeans length , judging from the fact that , for @xmath48 , reference clouds with @xmath144 expand rather than contract . ] . because the length of the bar is smaller than the critical wavelength for gravitational fragmentation , it does not fragment . instead",
    ", a round dense region , which we called the `` truly first core '' , is formed at the center due to a supersonic infall motion along the bar .",
    "initially , the truly first core is supported primarily by the thermal pressure . as ambient gas with a larger angular momentum",
    "accretes onto it , the rotational support becomes dominant . as a result , the central core evolves into a rapidly - rotating , opaque disk , which we will sometimes refer to as the `` first disk '' .",
    "the interaction between the disk and the large - scale bar mode outside the disk excites another bar - mode growing inside the disk .",
    "we believe that the secondary bar growth is due to rotational instability because the ratio of the rotational energy and the gravitational energy of the first disk reaches the critical value of @xmath145 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by the time shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , the bar breaks up into two blobs , which appear to be self - gravitating .",
    "we stopped our calculation at this epoch of fragmentation because the volume densities of the blobs reach the critical density beyond which h@xmath146 dissociation starts and the equation of state of the gas is expected to change again .",
    "the fate of the two blobs formed in the disk is uncertain .",
    "they may merge together during the subsequent evolution .",
    "since the rotation period of the disk is faster than that of the large - scale bar outside the disk , the interaction between the two bar modes generates several blobs in the disk , some of which appear to be self - gravitating .",
    "these blobs are expected to interact gravitationally and whether any of them can survive the interaction remains to be determined .",
    "this type of fragmentation and merging in a rotating disk was also observed in the numerical simulations of non - magnetic cloud collapse .",
    "in the previous sections , we have shown that core - forming clouds tend to become unstable to the bar mode after the supercritical core formation .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper and in li & nakamura ( 2002 ) indicate that fragmentation of magnetic clouds happens readily over a wide range of initial cloud parameters . on the surface",
    ", this result appears to contradict earlier numerical studies of magnetic cloud fragmentation , which suggest that strong magnetic fields tend to stifle fragmentation of dynamically collapsing clouds @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite performed three - dimensional mhd simulations on initially magnetically supercritical clouds and found that none of his clouds show any evidence for fragmentation even in the presence of a large density perturbation with a fractional amplitude of 50% .",
    "we emphasize that there are two important differences between our model and the previous ones .",
    "first , previous studies considered a frozen - in field , whereas in our study ambipolar diffusion is a crucial ingredient .",
    "our initial cloud , which is supported by a strong magnetic field , is stable to gravitational fragmentation as well as dynamic collapse .",
    "the weakening of the magnetic support driven by ambipolar diffusion is what initiates the dynamic collapse and fragmentation .",
    "second , the contribution of the magnetic tension to the cloud support is much weaker in the earlier studies ; indeed , most of them took a uniform magnetic field as the initial state ( which of course has no magnetic tension ) .",
    "the beneficial effect of magnetic tension on cloud fragmentation was discussed by @xcite , who showed that a strong magnetic tension can slow down cloud contraction appreciably , which tends to enhance cloud fragmentation .",
    "recently , @xcite reviewed the theoretical studies on binary star formation , concentrating on the non - magnetic case .",
    "he found broad agreement among numerical simulations by various groups that non - magnetic clouds are susceptible to prompt fragmentation if they collapse from an initial configuration that is relatively uniform in density and contains more than a few jeans masses of material .",
    "if supported only by thermal pressure , such a configuration is highly unstable .",
    "the question is then @xcite : how is nature able to produce such an unstable configuration in the first place ?",
    "we believe that the key to resolve this apparent difficulty is the presence of a strong magnetic field , which stabilizes the entire cloud even when the cloud mass is well above one thermal jeans mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "specific models of core formation in magnetically subcritical clouds appear able to explain the mass distribution and extended subsonic infall motions inferred in several starless cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are consistent with pattern of chemical differentiation observed in l1544 @xcite , provided that the initial flux - to - mass ratio lies within a factor of two or so of the critical value , as adopted in this paper",
    ".      dense cores of molecular clouds are observed to have significant elongation , with a typical aspect ratio of 2 in the plane of sky @xcite .",
    "their true three - dimensional shapes are probably triaxial , as inferred statistically by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have previously noted that the triaxial core shape can naturally result from nonlinear growth of the bar mode in the direction perpendicular to the field lines , coupled with the flattening of the mass distribution along the field lines @xcite .",
    "the models presented in  [ sec : results ] strengthen this conclusion .",
    "we find that the aspect ratio of the bar is more or less independent of the initial model parameters .",
    "it stays at about 1.5 @xmath111 2 during the period when @xmath59 decreases from @xmath147 to @xmath148 , after the core has become supercritical ( which makes bar growth possible ) but before the ratio of effective gravity to effective pressure force exceeds @xmath113 ( when the bar elongation is greatly amplified through the lin - mestel - shu instability ) .",
    "this initial period of supercritical phase is also the phase most likely observed as a starless core , when the core is dense enough to be identified as a core using high density tracers ( such as nh@xmath149 or cs ) , but before rapid collapse sets in which quickly produces a stellar object at the center , ending the starless phase .    in this supercritical collapse phase , the decrease of the central flux - to - mass ratio saturates at about half the critical value , almost independent of the initial parameters ( see panel [ b ] of fig . [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this saturation of flux - to - mass ratio is also observed in axisymmetric models @xcite .",
    "it means that the supercritical cores remain significantly magnetized , and magnetic fields may not be completely ignored even during the dynamic collapse phase of star formation .",
    "observations of nearby star forming regions have established that binary fraction among pre - main sequence stars is at least as high as among the main - sequence stars . in some nearby low - mass star forming regions like taurus - auriga , the binary frequency is even higher than that of main - sequence stars . in such low - mass star forming regions , stellar densities ( @xmath150 pc@xmath151 ) are much too low to allow the formation of binaries by capture or their destruction by gravitational encounters within their ages of @xmath69 1 myr .",
    "this indicates that the observed high binary frequencies more or less reflect the pristine population of proto - binaries at the epoch of formation , suggesting that binary and small multiple stars are formed prior to pre - main sequence phase by gravitational fragmentation of parent dense molecular cloud cores .",
    "in fact , recent high resolution millimeter observations of dust continuum have revealed evidence of gravitational fragmentation of protostellar cores in the earliest , class 0 and i phases .",
    "such observations were summarized in @xcite , who classified young multiple star systems into three types : ( 1 ) separate envelope ( separation @xmath152 au ) , ( 2 ) common envelope ( separation 150 @xmath111 3000 au ) , and ( 3 ) common disk systems ( separation @xmath153 au ) .",
    "separate envelope systems exhibit clearly distinct centers of gravitationally bound cores with separations greater than 6000 au and the components are surrounded by low density material ( e.g. , ngc1333 irs2 , svs13 ) .",
    "common envelope systems have one primary core of gravitational concentration which apparently breaks up into multiple fragments with separations of 100 @xmath111 3000 au ( e.g. , iras 16293 - 2422 ) .",
    "common disk systems have circumbinary disk - like envelopes surrounding young stellar objects with separations smaller than 100 au ( e.g. , l1551 irs5 ) .",
    "we have also uncovered three distinct types of fragmentation of magnetic clouds in our numerical experiments .",
    "they correspond roughly with the above empirical classification of young binary and multiple star systems . based upon the results presented in ",
    "[ sec : fragmentation ] , we classify theoretically the process of fragmentation into three types , depending on the initial model parameters : ( 1 ) _ separate core formation _ , in which the cloud breaks up into two separate cores during the isothermal collapse phase , ( 2 ) _ bar fragmentation _ , in which the aspect ratio of the bar becomes large enough to break up into multiple fragments along the major axis and the fragmentation takes place after the bar has become opaque to dust emission , and ( 3 ) _ disk fragmentation _ , in which the central region , after becoming opaque to dust emission , evolves into a rapidly rotating disk , which fragments into multiple blobs .",
    "these cases are discussed in turn .",
    "when the initial cloud has a relatively flat central part and is rotating relatively rapidly ( e.g. , @xmath133 for @xmath154 ) , it fragments into two separate cores during the isothermal collapse phase in the presence of an @xmath0 perturbation after the central region becomes magnetically supercritical ( _ separate core formation _ ) .",
    "morphologically , this case resembles the separate envelope systems discussed in @xcite .",
    "the early phase of fragmentation also looks like the double - core in the extinction map of fest 1 - 457 @xcite ( see laundardt [ 2001 ] for another example of double - core , in bok globule cb 230 ) . when first produced , the dense cores have insufficient orbital rotation to prevent them from spiraling towards each other .",
    "we expect their separation to shrink appreciably with time , producing perhaps a highly eccentric system .",
    "whether they will eventually merge together is unclear at the present .",
    "we suspect that the cores will survive to become individual star / stellar system , since the density is much higher inside the cores than outside by the end of our calculations .",
    "this means that it takes the cores much less time to collapse onto themselves to form stars than to merge together .",
    "moreover , there exists a strong magnetic field outside the cores which can prevent direct core collision . in our separate core formation case ,",
    "the density of the central inter - core region decreases with time as matter falls towards the cores , whereas the field strength increases due to magnetic flux diffusion out of the cores into the inter - core region .",
    "indeed , the central inter - core region may become magnetically subcritical again at the later stages of evolution .",
    "this region serves as a `` magnetic cushion '' to direct core collision .",
    "we propose that the separate core formation is a mechanism for producing wide binaries with separations of @xmath9 au .",
    "each core will have a second chance at fragmentation at higher densities , when a first bar or rotating disk is formed .",
    "the secondary fragmentation within each core could lead to the formation of a small ( hierarchical ) multiple star system . as mentioned earlier",
    ", separate core formation in the presence of an @xmath0 perturbation has much in common with the multiple fragmentation induced by higher order perturbations that we studied previously in @xcite .",
    "multiple core formation is an related channel for wide binary and multiple star formation .",
    "when the initial cloud contains a mass well above the thermal jeans mass and has a moderately centrally condensed density distribution ( e.g , @xmath134 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) , a long bar is formed , which can break up into several ( pairs of ) fragments after the bar becomes opaque to the dust emission ( _ bar fragmentation _ ) .",
    "the multiple fragments grow in mass due to both merging and accretion .",
    "this bar fragmentation case would correspond to the common envelope systems of @xcite , since the whole bar is embedded within a common core out of which the bar is formed .",
    "the bar fragmentation occurs at a density of @xmath157 @xmath3 . according to linear perturbation theory , a highly elongated bar breaks up gravitationally into fragments , with separations comparable to the wavelength of the most unstable linear perturbation , which corresponds to @xmath158 au at @xmath157 @xmath3 .",
    "the typical masses of the fragments are in the substellar regime .",
    "some of the fragments could be ejected out of the system in the course of dynamical interaction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "those ejected may become isolated brown dwarfs @xcite and perhaps even free - floating massive planets .",
    "interestingly , the cloud parameters derived by @xcite for the well - studied starless core l1544 put the cloud in the bar fragmentation category .",
    "therefore , l1544 appears to be a progenitor of a binary or small multiple star system of the common envelope type .    when the initial cloud mass in the central plateau region is comparable to the thermal jeans mass ( e.g. , @xmath159 for @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) , the bar mode does not grow much during the isothermal collapse , and it is difficult for the ( relatively short ) bar to break up into fragments ( _ disk fragmentation _ ) . in this case",
    ", the central region evolves into a rapidly rotating disk whose size depends on the rate of initial rotation .",
    "the interaction of the central disk with the bar generates complex structures in the disk where a secondary bar mode is excited by rotational instability if @xmath162 .",
    "typically , the size of centrifugal radius is of the order of 10 au . when the disk fragments into blobs , the separations of the blobs should be of the same order of the disk radius .",
    "this case may be responsible for the formation of binary stars with a separation smaller than @xmath6 au .",
    "this case would be related to the common disk system of @xcite .    as mentioned in   [",
    "sec : method ] , we did not consider angular momentum transfer in the vertical direction , which can brake the cloud rotation efficiently during the relatively long magnetically subcritical phase of evolution @xcite .",
    "magnetic braking is thought to be responsible for the low rates of rotation observed in dense cores @xcite and adopted in this paper .",
    "once the central region of the cloud becomes supercritical , the peak density increases in a runaway fashion , leaving little time for the magnetic braking to operate efficiently @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect the formation of separate cores , which occurs in the runaway collapse phase , to be little affected by magnetic braking .",
    "after a bar or a disk becomes dense enough to be opaque to dust emission , it can be supported by thermal pressure for a time long compared to the local dynamic time , and magnetic braking can in principle become efficient again @xcite . however , at such high densities , magnetic fields start to decouple from matter @xcite , which could render the braking inefficient .",
    "we will postpone a detailed treatment of the magnetic braking including the effects of decoupling to a future work .",
    "in this paper , we have followed the early phases of cloud fragmentation in magnetic clouds , using a two - dimensional mhd code based on the thin - disk approximation . at the end of our calculations",
    ", we obtained dense , discrete fragments out of initially axisymmetric clouds perturbed by an @xmath0 mode of modest fractional amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "the masses of the fragments are still small , on the order of @xmath163 m@xmath5 .",
    "we expect the fragments to grow to stellar masses , by merging and further accretion , except perhaps those ejected dynamically out of the system soon after the fragmentation .",
    "the masses of those ejected may remain frozen in the substellar regime .",
    "we found three types of fragmentation in magnetic clouds .",
    "they are ( 1 ) a cloud breaking up during the isothermal phase of cloud evolution into separate cores , each of which collapses more or less independently into a star / stellar system ( panels [ b ] and [ c ] of fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) , ( 2 ) a core collapsing into a needle - like , opaque `` first bar '' , which breaks up into several fragments ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) , and ( 3 ) a rapidly rotating , opaque `` first disk '' producing self - gravitating blobs , which may survive to become seeds of relatively close binary and multiple systems ( figs . [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "the fragments in the above cases share , respectively , a common cloud , common core , and common disk .",
    "they correspond loosely to the empirical classification of independent envelope , common envelope and common disk systems for the youngest , embedded binary and multiple systems .",
    "much work is needed to firm up this connection .    in the near future",
    ", we plan to extend our numerical simulations beyond the initial fragmentation to the protostellar accretion phase , to determine the physical properties of the binary and multiple systems formed in magnetic clouds , such as their eccentricity , mass ratio , and orbital period . in a longer run , we hope to generalize the calculations to 3d , which will allow for a detailed study of magnetic braking , which may have a profound impact on the final orbits of the formed stellar system .",

    "<S> in the standard scenario of isolated low - mass star formation , strongly magnetized molecular clouds are envisioned to condense gradually into dense cores , driven by ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> once the cores become magnetically supercritical , they collapse to form stars . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies based on this scenario are limited to axisymmetric calculations leading to single supercritical core formation . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of axisymmetry has precluded a detailed investigation of cloud fragmentation , generally thought to be a necessary step in the formation of binary and multiple stars . in a series of papers </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the non - axisymmetric evolution of initially magnetically subcritical clouds , using a two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code based on the physically motivated thin - disk approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that such clouds become unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations after the supercritical cores are formed due to ambipolar diffusion . in this paper , we focus on the evolution of clouds perturbed by an @xmath0 mode of a modest fractional amplitude of 5% , with an eye on binary and multiple star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for a wide range of initial cloud parameters , the @xmath0 mode grows nonlinearly into a bar during the isothermal collapse after the supercritical core formation . </S>",
    "<S> the instability is driven by the domination of the magnetically - diluted gravity over the combined thermal and magnetic pressure gradient in the supercritical cores . </S>",
    "<S> such gravity - dominated cores can break up into fragments during or after the isothermal phase of cloud evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the outcome of fragmentation depends on the initial cloud conditions , such as the magnetic field strength , rotation rate , amount of cloud mass ( relative to thermal jeans mass ) and mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is classified into three different types : ( 1 ) _ separate core formation _ , in which the bar ( @xmath0 ) mode breaks up into two separate cores during the isothermal collapse , with a core separation of order @xmath1 au , ( 2 ) _ bar fragmentation _ </S>",
    "<S> , in which the @xmath0 mode evolves into a needle - like , opaque `` first bar '' ( at a density @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , which breaks up into multiple fragments with initial masses of order @xmath4 m@xmath5 and separations of order @xmath6-@xmath7 au , and ( 3 ) _ disk fragmentation _ , in which the bar growth remains slow during the isothermal collapse and the central region evolves into a rapidly rotating , opaque `` first disk '' , which breaks up into several self - gravitating blobs with separations less than the disk size ( @xmath8 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> these three types of fragmentation loosely correspond to the empirical classification of embedded binary and multiple systems of looney , mundy , & welch , based on millimeter dust continuum observations . </S>",
    "<S> the well - studied starless core , l1544 , appears to belong to the bar fragmentation type . </S>",
    "<S> we expect it to produce a highly elongated , opaque bar at the center in the future , which should break up into fragments of initial masses in the substellar regime . </S>"
