    "the systematic study of graphs ( or more precisely the t_linear graphs _ , as it was called in that time ) began sometimes in the late forties , through seminal works by p. erds , p. turn , w.t .",
    "tutte , and others .",
    "one problem which received considerable attention was the existence of certain subgraphs of a given graph .",
    "for example such subgraph could be a perfect matching in a ( not necessarily bipartite ) graph , or a hamiltonian cycle through all vertices , etc .",
    "generally these substructures are called _ factors_. the first couple of important results of this kind are due to w.t .",
    "tutte who gave necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of 1-factors and @xmath0-factors .    in the case of complete graphs ,",
    "the existence problem of such factors is considerably easier .",
    "in particular , the existence problem of ( sometimes simple ) undirected graphs with given degree sequences even admits simple greedy algorithms for its solution .",
    "subsequently , the theory was extended for factor problems of directed graphs as well , but the greedy type algorithm mentioned above , to the best knowledge of the authors , is missing even today .    in this paper",
    "we fill this gap : after giving a short and comprehensive ( but definitely not exhausting ) history of the @xmath0-factor problem ( section  [ sc : history ] ) , we describe a greedy algorithm to decide the existence of a directed simple graph possessing the prescribed degree sequence ( section  [ sc : detail ] ) . in section  [ sc : brual ]",
    "we prove a consequence of the previous existence theorem , which is a necessary ingredient for the construction of edge - swap based markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods to sample directed graphs with prescribed degree sequence . finally in section  [ sec : constrained ] we discuss a slightly harder existence problem of directed graphs with prescribed degree sequences where some vertex - pairs are excluded from the constructions .",
    "this result can help to efficiently generate all possible directed graphs with a given degree sequence .",
    "for a given function @xmath1 , an _",
    "@xmath0-factor _ of a given simple graph @xmath2 is a subgraph @xmath3 such that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 one of the very first key results of modern graph theory is due to w.t .",
    "tutte : in 1947 he gave a complete characterization of simple graphs with an @xmath0-factor in case of @xmath6 ( tutte s 1-factor theorem , @xcite ) .",
    "tutte later solved the problem of the existence of @xmath0-factors for general @xmath0 s ( tutte s @xmath0-factor theorem , @xcite ) . in 1954",
    "he also found a beautiful graph transformation to handle @xmath0-factor problems via perfect matchings in bipartite graphs @xcite .",
    "this also gave a clearly polynomial time algorithm for finding @xmath0-factors .    in cases where @xmath7 is a complete graph",
    ", the @xmath0-factor problem becomes easier : then we are simply interested in the existence of a graph with a given degree sequence ( the exact definitions will come in section  [ sc : detail ] ) . in 1955 p. havel developed a simple greedy algorithm to solve the _ degree sequence problem _ for simple undirected graphs ( @xcite ) . in 1960",
    "p. erds and t. gallai studied the @xmath0-factor problem for the case of a complete graph @xmath7 , and proved a simpler tutte - type result for the degree sequence problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as they already pointed out , the result can be derived directly form the original @xmath0-factor theorem , taking into consideration the special properties of the complete graph @xmath7 , but their proof was independent of tutte s proof and they referred to havel s theorem .    in 1962",
    "hakimi studied the degree sequence problem in undirected graphs with multiple edges ( @xcite ) .",
    "he developed an erds - gallai type result for this much simpler case , and for the case of simple graphs he rediscovered the greedy algorithm of havel . since then this algorithm is referred to as",
    "the _ havel  hakimi algorithm_.    for directed graphs the analogous question of recognizability of a _ bi - graphical - sequence _ comes naturally . in this case",
    "we are given two @xmath8-element vectors @xmath9 of non - negative integers .",
    "the problem is the existence of a directed graph on @xmath8 vertices , such that the first vector represents the out - degrees and the second one the in - degrees of the vertices in this graph . in 1957",
    "d. gale and h. j. ryser independently solved this problem for simple directed graphs ( there are no parallel edges , but loops are allowed ) , see @xcite . in 1958 c. berge generalized these results for @xmath10-graphs where at most @xmath10 parallel edges are allowed ( @xcite ) .",
    "( berge calls the out - degree and in - degree together the _ demi - degrees_. ) finally in 1973 , the revised version of his book _ graphs _ ( @xcite ) gives a solution for the @xmath10-graph problem , loops excluded . to show some of the afterlife of these results : d. west in his renowned recent textbook ( @xcite ) , discusses the case of simple directed graphs with loops allowed .",
    "the analog of @xmath0-factor problems for directed graphs has a sparser history .",
    "ystein ore started the systematic study of that question in 1956 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "his method is rather algebraic , and the finite and infinite cases - more or less - are discussed together .",
    "the first part developed the tools and proved the directly analog result of tutte s @xmath0-factor problem for finite directed graphs ( with loops ) , while the second part dealt with the infinite case .    in 1962",
    "ford and d.r .",
    "fulkerson studied , generalized and solved the  original \" @xmath0-factor problem for a directed graph @xmath11 ( @xcite ) . here",
    "lower and upper bounds were given for both demi - degrees of the desired subgraph ( no parallel edges , no loops ) with the original question naturally corresponding to equal lower and upper bounds .",
    "the solutions ( as well as in berge s cases ) are based on network flow theory .",
    "finally , in a later paper hakimi also proves results for bi - graphical sequences , however , without presenting a directed version of his original greedy algorithm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a sequence @xmath12 of nonnegative integers is called a _ graphical sequence _ if a simple graph @xmath2 exists on @xmath8 nodes , @xmath13 , whose degree sequence is @xmath14 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath7 _ realizes _ the sequence @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity of the notation we will consider only sequences of strictly positive integers ( @xmath15 ) to avoid isolated points .",
    "the following , well - known result , was proved independently by v. havel and s.l .",
    "hakimi .",
    "[ tm : hh ] there exists a simple graph with degree sequence @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) if and only if there exists one with degree sequence @xmath19 .",
    "( note that there is no prescribed ordering relation between @xmath20 and the other degrees . )",
    "this can be proved using a recursive procedure , which transforms any realization of the degree sequence into the form described in the theorem [ tm : hh ] , by a sequence of two - edge swaps .    a _ bi - degree - sequence _ ( or _ bds _ for short ) @xmath21 @xmath22 of nonnegative integers",
    "is called a _ bi - graphical sequence _ if there exists a simple directed graph ( digraph ) @xmath23 on @xmath8 nodes , @xmath24 , such that the out - degree and in - degree sequences together form @xmath25 .",
    "( that is the out - degree of vertex @xmath26 is @xmath27 and its in - degree is @xmath28 ) in this case we say that @xmath11 _ realizes _ our bds . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider only sequences of strictly positive integer bds s , that is each degree is @xmath29 and @xmath30 , to avoid isolated points .",
    "our goal is to prove a havel  hakimi type algorithm to realize bi - graphical sequences . to that end",
    "we introduce the notion of normal order : we say that the bds is in _ normal order _ if the entries satisfy the following properties : for each @xmath31 we either have @xmath32 or @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , all bds - s can be arranged into normal order .",
    "note that we made no ordering assumption about node @xmath35 ( the pair @xmath36 ) .",
    "[ tm : newhh ]    assume that the bds @xmath25 @xmath37with @xmath30 , @xmath38)$ ] is in normal order and @xmath39 ( recall : the out - degree of the last vertex is positive ) .",
    "then @xmath25 is bi - graphical if and only if the bds @xmath40 with zero elements removed ( those @xmath41 for which @xmath42 ) is bi - graphical .    before starting the proof",
    ", we emphasize the similarity between this result and the original hh - algorithm .",
    "as in the undirected case , using theorem  [ tm : newhh ] , we can find in a greedy way a proper realization of graphical bi - degree sequences .    indeed",
    ": choose any vertex @xmath35 with non - zero out - degree from the sequence , arrange the rest in normal order , then make @xmath43 connections from @xmath35 to nodes with largest in - degrees , thus constructing the out - neighborhood of @xmath35 in the ( final ) realization .",
    "next , remove the vertices ( if any ) from the remaining sequence that have lost both their in- and out- degrees in the process , pick a node with non - zero out - degree , then arrange the rest in normal order . applying theorem 2 again , we find the final out - neighborhood of our second chosen vertex .",
    "step by step we find this way the out - neighborhood of all vertices , while their in - neighborhoods get defined eventually ( being exhausted by incoming edges ) .",
    "note , that every vertex in this process is picked at most once , namely , when its out - neighborhood is determined by the theorem , and never again after that .",
    "our forthcoming proof is not the simplest , however , we use a more general setup to shorten the proofs of later results .",
    "first , we define the partial order @xmath44 among @xmath45-element vectors of increasing positive integers : we say @xmath46 iff for each @xmath47 we have @xmath48    a _",

    "@xmath61 is defined as : @xmath62    in other words , if @xmath51 is a pon in a bds , then the reduced degree sequence @xmath63 is obtained by removing the out - edges of node @xmath35 ( according to the possible out - neighborhood @xmath51 ) . as usual , if for one subscript @xmath45 in the @xmath51-reduced bds we have @xmath64 then the vertex with this index is to be removed from the bi - degree sequence .",

    "since our @xmath51-reduced bds @xmath72 is bi - graphical , there exists a directed graph @xmath11 which realizes the bi - degree sequence @xmath72 .",

    "the bi - degree - sequence of @xmath77 is @xmath80 our goal is to construct another realization @xmath81 of @xmath65 such that the deletion of the out - edges of @xmath35 in the latter produces the bds @xmath71 .",
    "by definition we have @xmath82 ( the edge set of @xmath77 ) but @xmath83 .",

    "( formally we create the new graph @xmath97 such that @xmath98 ) this achieves our wanted realization .",

    "* remark * : in the case of undirected graphs the ( original ) analogous observation ( needing only two - edges swaps ) was proved by h.j .",

    ". therefore the total number of out - degrees is @xmath166 in both directed graphs , and by the inductive assumption there is a sequence @xmath167 of @xmath168 many swaps which transforms @xmath169 into @xmath170 .",
    "now observe that if a swap transforms @xmath171 into @xmath172 , then the  inverse swap \" ( choosing the same edges and non - edges and swap them ) transforms @xmath172 into @xmath171 .",

    "in network modeling of complex systems ( for a rather general reference see @xcite ) one usually defines a ( di)graph with components of the system being represented by the nodes , and the interactions ( usually directed ) amongst the components being represented as the edges of this digraph .",
    "typical cases include biological networks , such as the metabolic network , signal transduction networks , gene transcription networks , etc .",
    "the graph is usually inferred from empirical observations of the system and it is uniquely determined if one can specify all the connections in the graph . frequently , however , the data available from the system is incomplete , and one can not uniquely determine this graph . in this case",

    "however , in ( those very small ) cases when reasonable answers can be expected for problem ( ii ) , problem ( i ) is rather uninteresting .",
    "in general , however , ( i ) can not be solved efficiently by the use of ( ii ) .",
    "the situation is very similar to the non - directed case , see @xcite .",
