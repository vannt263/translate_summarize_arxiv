    "in recent years , internet of things ( iot ) has received a lot of attention in research and practice .",
    "it has been adopted in various crucial applications , such as smart logistics , smart home , smart healthcare and intelligent vehicles @xcite .",
    "as predicted by cisco , there will be over @xmath0 billion smart things connected to the internet by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such multitudinous iot devices are bound to consume a considerable amount of resources and result in new issues that must be taken care of .",
    "since the future iot will probably take the form of a cloud - based mobile network @xcite , most of the iot devices move around constantly , such as self - driving cars , high speed trains and mobile sensors .",
    "these multifarious mobile sensing and computing devices are expected to provide huge amounts of physical data to the iot cloud .",
    "given such highly dense networks , devices mobility undeniably incur more severe multi - user interference and deteriorates the system throughput . in most of the previous papers , however , system sum - rate is analyzed only under quasi - static fading conditions @xcite , which is not practical in future mobile communications scenarios . in this sense , it becomes immensely important to take into account the performance degradation caused by devices mobility .",
    "although some researchers have investigated the impact of the maximum doppler frequency on system performance @xcite , they mainly concentrate on orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) settings .",
    "some later works focus on orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) protocols , but the system impairments were incurred by frequency offsets @xcite or the two - tier femtocell network architecture @xcite .",
    "devices mobility features and the induced multi - user interference have not been fully investigated .    in this paper , based on the newly proposed narrow band ofdma ( nb - ofdma ) @xcite , we thoroughly analyze the impacts of devices mobility on the inter sub - carrier interference ( ici ) and the system sum - rate in the uplink of a iot cellular communication system .",
    "devices are modeled as possion point processes ( ppp ) and are characterized with independent velocities and moving directions . under broadband multi - path fading conditions ,",
    "the expression of the total ici power suffered by each device is derived .",
    "the corresponding upper and lower bounds are also provided , from which an approximate relationship between the interference level and devices maximum velocity is formulated .",
    "subsequently , we analyze the performance of nb - ofdma under various metrics of interest ( e.g. , single - device ergodic capacity and system sum - rate ) . note that while we focus on the scenario of nb - ofdma , the results in this paper may apply to the general ofdma situations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is described . in section iii",
    ", we theoretically analyze the impacts of devices mobility on the inter sub - carrier interference , single - device ergodic capacity and system sum - rate .",
    "section iv gives the relevant numerical results . and",
    "finally , section v concludes the work .",
    "in this section , the mobility features of moving devices and the multi - path effects of the propagation channel in cellular systems are described .",
    "the uplink transmission model is also presented .      as depicted in fig .",

    "single - antenna mobile devices are randomly distributed around the bs .",
    "the radius of the cell is @xmath3 and this nb - ofdma system has access to @xmath4 sub - carriers in most cases@xcite . however , we use an odd number of sub - carriers to facilitate the ensuing analysis .",

    ", scatterer @xmath9 possesses a time - varying attenuation @xmath10 , a random phase shift @xmath11 and a delay @xmath12 . ]    for a given time instant , using polar coordinates , we can easily characterize the the position of device @xmath13 as @xmath7 .",
    "assume that the instantaneous locations of mobile devices are determined through a series of poisson point processes , then the probability density functions ( pdf ) of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively given by @xmath16 meanwhile , let @xmath17 denote the instantaneous velocity of device @xmath13 and @xmath18 be the included angle between the moving direction and the line - of - sight direction .",
    "assume that devices have independent mobility features , then it is reasonable to assume that devices velocities and moving directions are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with uniform distributions , i.e. , their pdfs are @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the maximum velocity of each device .      in practice , the signal transmitted from device @xmath13 is reflected by numbers of surrounding local scatterers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_path_model ] , and thereby propagating along several distinct paths .",
    "assume that the waves transmitted from mobile devices are planar , and therefore , only single scattering occurs . in this sense",
    ", each scatterer contributes to a specific propagation path . taking device @xmath13 for example , assume it is enclosed by @xmath21 local scatterers , then it is trivial that the coressponding multi - path channel @xmath22 comprises @xmath21 paths . without loss of generality ,",
    "we suppose @xmath21 is known and fixed .",
    "next , again invoking ppp , these local scatterers are assumed to be uniformly distributed within a radius of @xmath23 . among them , scatterer @xmath9 ( i.e. , the @xmath9-th path ) introduces a time - varying amplitude attenuation @xmath10 , a random phase shift @xmath11 and a delay @xmath12 .",
    "then the multi - path channel can be modelled as @xmath24 where @xmath25= 1 $ ] since the channel is of unit power in the long term .",
    "moreover , let @xmath26 denote the included angle between the @xmath9-th path and the moving direction of device @xmath13 , which is uniformly distributed in @xmath27 . under this setting ,",
    "the doppler frequency induced by the @xmath9-th path is obtained as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the wave propagation speed , @xmath30 denotes the carrier center frequency .",
    "based on the modeling framework above , now we are able to derive the received signal at the bs as @xmath31 where    * @xmath32 represents the path loss .",

    "@xmath38 is the complex gaussian noise process .",
    "we emphasize that , to mitigate the near - far effect , a power control scheme is invoked so that the average power levels of all signals at the bs are identical @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 define @xmath40 , then the path loss component in ( [ system_model ] ) can be dropped .",
    "furthermore , since the path gain @xmath41 remains constant in one symbol period @xmath42 , it is practical to discard the parameter @xmath43 and rewrite the transmission model as @xmath44 now invoking sub - carrier @xmath13 , the demodulated signal is @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the individual ici component from device @xmath36 to device @xmath13 through its @xmath9-th path .",

    "in this section , we first construct the relation between ici level and devices mobility .",
    "then , on this basis , the induced nb - ofdma ergodic capacity and system sum - rate are investigated .      to justify ( [ multi - path_channel ] ) and ( [ demodulated_signal ] ) more conveniently",

    "the signal transmitted from each device passes through a peculiar multi - path channel and is finally received and demodulated by the base station .    within this framework ,",
    "let us look into the demodulated signal using sub - carrier @xmath13 .",
    "the disturbing interference comes from the other @xmath5 sub - carriers due to the loss of orthogonality . to further elucidate how the data symbol of device @xmath36 influence the device @xmath13 , we divide the propagation channel @xmath51 into @xmath52 particular transmission links , as depicted by the red dashed - line - box . under this setting",

    "this theorem indicates that devices mobility incurs a power penalty in nb - ofdma system .    without loss of generality ,",
