    "quantum walks @xcite emerged as an extension of a concept of a random walk to a unitary evolution of a quantum particle on a discrete graph or lattice .",
    "soon , their potential for quantum information processing was recognized @xcite .",
    "the quantum walk based algorithms which outperforms their classical counterparts were implemented for problems such as database search @xcite or finding a path in a randomly glued tree graphs @xcite .",
    "later it was shown @xcite that quantum walks represent a universal tool for quantum computation .",
    "more recently quantum walk based algorithms are being developed for problems such as graph isomorphism testing @xcite or finding structural anomalies in graphs @xcite .",
    "for quite a long time the quantum walk was rather a theoretical concept , even though very fruitful .",
    "however , in 2009 the first experimental realization of a quantum walk on a line utilizing optically trapped atoms @xcite has been reported .",
    "the experiments with cold ions @xcite and photons @xcite followed shortly afterwards .",
    "these experiments were latter expanded to implement a quantum walk on a line with two non - interacting particles @xcite .",
    "more recently , an experiment implementing a quantum walk on a square lattice @xcite has been realized which was capable of simulating the walk on a line of two interacting particles @xcite .",
    "one of the distinctive features of quantum walks when compared with classical random walks is their quadratically faster spreading .",
    "this stems from the fact that the quantum walk is a wave phenomenon @xcite rather than a diffusion .",
    "the probability distributions resulting from quantum walks have typically an inverted - bell shape with characteristic peaks on the edges which propagate through the lattice with constant velocity . for quantum walks with homogeneous coin",
    "the probability distribution can be investigated by means of fourier analysis @xcite .",
    "important results are the weak - limit theorems @xcite which prove the convergence of the moments of the re - scaled position of the quantum particle in the limit of large number of steps .",
    "this allows one to derive the so - called group - velocity density which can be used to approximate the probability distribution generated by the quantum walk and to evaluate the moments of this distribution .",
    "more recently , a method based on matrix - valued orthogonal polynomials have been developed @xcite which extends the analysis to models with inhomogeneities .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the position distributions of two one - parameter families of three - state quantum walks which we have introduced in @xcite .",
    "these families of quantum walks were derived as extensions of the three - state grover walk .",
    "this particular model was extensively studied in the literature @xcite where it was found that it differs considerably from the two - state walk @xcite .",
    "namely , the three - state grover walk features the so - called localization effect , which means that the particle has a non - vanishing probability to stay at any position even in the limit of infinite number of steps .",
    "the reason why does this effect appear is that the evolution operator of the three - state grover walk possess apart from continuous spectrum also an isolated eigenvalue .",
    "the corresponding stationary state is unfolded over the whole lattice . provided that it has a non - zero overlap with the initial condition , part of the wave - packet describing the quantum particle",
    "will remain trapped at the already visited sites and will not evolve anymore .",
    "this results in an additional central peak in the probability distribution of the three - state grover walk which is exponentially decaying with the distance from the origin but is independent of the number of steps . the same holds for the two families of quantum walks we have derived in @xcite since they preserve the point spectrum .",
    "however , they do not exhaust the set of quantum walks with localization , as we have recently shown in @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of such quantum walks is not described solely by the group - velocity density , since this part takes into account only the continuous spectrum . to obtain the full probability distribution",
    "one has to include also the localization stemming from the point spectrum .",
    "for the three - state grover walk these two parts of the probability distribution were derived recently by falkner and boettcher in @xcite , where the authors have also discussed the rate of convergence of the moments of the distribution to the asymptotic values determined by the group - velocity density . at the same time , machida @xcite presented similar results extended to one of the families of quantum walks with localization we have introduced in @xcite and discussed the application of the three - state walk for preparation of discrete uniform measures .",
    "however , both results @xcite have a significant drawback .",
    "namely , the dependence of both the group - velocity density and the localization probability on the initial coin state is rather involved .",
    "the reason for this inconvenience is that the initial coin state is expressed in the standard basis of the coin space .",
    "however , we can describe the initial state in a different basis which proves to be more suitable for the analysis of the quantum walk .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that for the hadamard walk on a line this suitable basis is given by the eigenstates of the coin operator .",
    "the approach resembles the transformation from bare states to dressed states familiar from quantum optics @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we explore the transformation to the basis formed by the eigenstates of the coin operator further and apply it to the two families of three - state quantum walks introduced in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we analyze the family of quantum walks constructed in @xcite as a parametrization of eigenvectors of the grover coin .",
    "we show that the results @xcite simplify considerably when the initial coin state is expressed in basis formed by eigenvectors of the coin operator .",
    "this allows us to determine the dependence of the moments of the distribution on the initial coin state .",
    "we also discuss the extremal regimes of quantum walks in consideration . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we turn to the second family of quantum walks from @xcite which was constructed as a parametrization of eigenvalues of the grover matrix .",
    "the details of the derivation of the localization probability and the group - velocity density are left for the appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "finally , we conclude and present an outlook in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "let us begin with a family of quantum walks which was introduced in @xcite and recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the coin operators are in the standard basis of the coin space @xmath0 given by the following matrix @xcite @xmath1 with the coin parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we exclude the boundary points from our consideration since they result in trivial walks .",
    "indeed , for @xmath3 the coin ( [ coin : rho ] ) reduces to a permutation matrix with an additional phase shift to the state @xmath4 .",
    "walk with such a coin can merely hop back and forth between the origin and its nearest neighbours . for the choice of @xmath5 the coin ( [ coin : rho ] )",
    "reduces to an identity matrix with an additional phase shift to the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such a coin is not mixing the coin states and the walk is simple - the @xmath6 component of the initial coin state keeps hopping to the left , the @xmath7 component keeps hopping to the right and the @xmath4 component remains at the origin .",
    "both quantum walks with @xmath3 and @xmath8 can be analyzed in a straightforward way without the need for the week - limit theorems .",
    "the set of coin operators ( [ coin : rho ] ) was constructed in @xcite by a special parametrization of the eigenvectors of the 3x3 grover matrix which is a member of this family corresponding to the choice of the coin parameter @xmath9 .",
    "one can show @xcite that the evolution operators of the quantum walks with the coin ( [ coin : rho ] ) have a non - empty point spectrum for all values of @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the quantum walks show the localization effect in a similar way as found originally for the three - state grover walk @xcite .",
    "the coin parameter @xmath11 determines directly the peak velocity of the walk @xcite , i.e. the positions of the peaks after @xmath12 steps of the quantum walk will be @xmath13 .",
    "the group - velocity density of quantum walks with the coin ( [ coin : rho ] ) was recently derived by falkner and boettcher @xcite for the special case of the grover walk corresponding to @xmath9 , and by machida @xcite for a general value of @xmath11 . for a particle starting the walk from the origin with the initial coin state",
    "@xmath14 the density has the form @xmath15 with the group - velocity density ( [ rho : machida ] ) one can determine the asymptotic value of the re - scaled moments of the particle s position @xmath16 in the limit of large number of steps @xmath12 .",
    "namely , the following relations hold for all @xmath17 @xmath18 the group - velocity density can be also used to approximate the probability distribution after a finite number of steps @xmath12 .",
    "we have to replace @xmath19 in ( [ rho : machida ] ) with @xmath20 and simultaneously re - normalize the distribution by @xmath21 .",
    "this will be applied later in the figures where we will compare the analytical results with a finite time numerical simulation .",
    "note that the density ( [ rho : machida ] ) looks relatively simple .",
    "however , we have yet to specify the terms @xmath22 which involve the dependence on the initial coin state @xmath14 .",
    "machida @xcite found that they are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coefficients of @xmath14 in the standard basis , i.e. @xmath26 ) considerably .",
    "it can be anticipated that such a suitable basis is the one formed by the eigenstates of the coin operator .",
    "the eigenvectors of the coin operator ( [ coin : rho ] ) read @xcite @xmath27 we decompose the initial coin state into the eigenstate basis in the form @xmath28 and @xmath29 are restricted by the normalization condition @xmath30 are in the eigenstate basis given by @xmath31 plugging these expressions into ( [ d : machida ] ) and using the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho ] ) we obtain much more convenient formulas for the terms @xmath22 , namely @xmath32 finally , the group - velocity density reads @xmath33 this result allows us to determine the dependence of the moments ( [ rho : moment ] ) on the initial coin state in a straightforward way .",
    "namely , odd moments of the group - velocity have the form @xmath34 where we have denoted @xmath35 we see that in the eigenstate basis the odd moments are determined by the coherent combination of the probability amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , the even moments ( [ rho : moment ] ) depend only on the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 of finding the particle initially in the coin state @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the mixed initial coin state of the form @xmath42 results in a distribution with the same even moments as the pure coin state ( [ psi : c : rho ] ) .",
    "in particular , the second moment is given by @xmath43 where we have used the notation @xmath44 one can easily check that the inequalities @xmath45 hold for all @xmath10 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the state giving rise to the distribution with the smallest variance is the one corresponding to @xmath46 , i.e. the eigenstate @xmath47 .",
    "analogously , the eigenstate @xmath40 yields the distribution with the greatest variance .",
    "we display the second moment ( [ v2:rho ] ) as a function of the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] for the choice of the coin parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the plot indicates that @xmath47 yields the smallest variance while @xmath40 gives the greatest .    ) as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have chosen the coin parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the plot indicates that the greatest variance is achieved for the initial state @xmath40 , while the smallest results from @xmath47 .",
    "the domain of the plot is restricted to the lower triangle since the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are limited by the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho]).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we note that the group - velocity density ( [ dist : rho ] ) is not normalized to unity , as was found in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we obtain the following result @xmath49 the remaining part of the probability is in the exponential peak corresponding to localization .",
    "this was also recently calculated by falkner and boettcher @xcite for @xmath9 corresponding to the grover walk , and by machida @xcite for a general value of @xmath11 . the probability to find the particle at position @xmath16 in the limit @xmath50",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath51 here @xmath52 depends on the coin parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 involves the initial coin state @xmath56 the simplification of this result by turning into the eigenvector basis ( [ rho : eigen ] ) is perhaps even more significant than the one achieved for the group - velocity density ( [ dist : rho ] ) . indeed , after some algebra we find that the localization probability @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 this result shows that the central peak is indeed an exponential with the base @xmath59 , except for the origin .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the initial coin state is particularly simple in the eigenvector basis . for the origin",
    "the localization probability is given by an incoherent combination of @xmath60 and @xmath39 , while outside the dependence is determined by a coherent combination of amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , the dependence differs for positive and negative @xmath16 .",
    "this fact can be exploited to force the particle to localize only on the positive or negative half - line by a proper choice of the initial coin state . as an example , consider the initial coin state @xmath62 using the expression ( [ loc : rho ] ) we find that in this case the localization probability equals @xmath63 localization thus appears only on the positive half - line .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure  [ fig : loc ] where we present the probability distribution of the grover walk corresponding to @xmath9 after @xmath64 steps . to unravel the unusual behaviour of localization we display only a small neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "after @xmath64 steps .",
    "the localization depicted by the blue - dashed line appears only for positive @xmath16 , as predicted by ( [ loc : pos]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we note that one can easily check that @xmath65 this together with ( [ rho : total : dens ] ) and the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho ] ) results in @xmath66 i.e. the complete probability density is properly normalized to unity .",
    "let us now illustrate our findings on several examples .",
    "a typical distribution resulting from the three - state walk with the coin ( [ coin : rho ] ) has three characteristic peaks .",
    "two are on the edges of the distribution and correspond to the divergency of the group - velocity density ( [ dist : rho ] ) for @xmath19 approaching @xmath67 .",
    "the third one is the exponential peak at the origin corresponding to localization ( [ loc : rho ] ) .",
    "however , these characteristics will be altered considerably when we chose one of the eigenvectors of the coin operator as the initial state of the walk .",
    "first , consider the eigenstate @xmath47 as the initial coin state of the walk . from the relation ( [ dist : rho ] ) we find that the group - velocity density is given by @xmath68 we see that the density does not diverge for @xmath19 approaching @xmath67 .",
    "hence , both peaks on the edges of the distribution disappear .",
    "we illustrate this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we display the distribution after 100 steps .",
    "the coin parameter was chosen as @xmath69 .",
    "after @xmath70 steps . as the initial state we have chosen the coin eigenstate @xmath47 .",
    "for this initial coin state both peaks on the edges of the distribution vanish .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the group - velocity density ( [ dist : rho : hp ] ) , depicted by the red curve , tends to zero for @xmath19 approaching @xmath67 . to unravel this feature we plot the probability distribution on the logarithmic scale .",
    "the blue - dashed line depicts the localization probability ( [ loc : rho]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us turn to the eigenstate @xmath40 . from the relation ( [ loc : rho ] ) we see that for the choice of the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 the localization probability equals zero for all @xmath16 . hence , for this initial state the localization disappears , in accordance with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we show the distribution after 100 steps and the coin parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we can clearly see that there are only two peaks on the edges of the distribution .",
    "consequently , the state @xmath40 yields the distribution with the greatest variance , as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .",
    "after @xmath70 steps . as the initial state we have chosen the coin eigenstate @xmath40 . for this initial coin state",
    "the localization effect disappears .",
    "the red curve corresponds to the density ( [ dist : rho]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    concerning the last eigenstate @xmath41 , we find that the group - velocity density is given by @xmath74 we see that the density vanishes as @xmath19 tends to zero . to illustrate this effect we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the distribution after 100 steps on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the coin parameter was chosen as @xmath48 .",
    "the plot indicates that the distribution tends to zero around the origin , except for a very small neighbourhood where the localization dominates .",
    "after @xmath70 steps . as the initial state we have chosen the coin eigenstate @xmath41 .",
    "the probability density ( [ dist : rho : h2 ] ) depicted by the red curve tends to zero near the origin . to unravel this effect we use logarithmic scale on the @xmath75-axis .",
    "the blue - dashed line corresponds to the localization probability ( [ loc : rho]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have seen that for the initial coin state @xmath47 both peaks on the edges of the distribution vanish .",
    "however , it is possible to construct a state for which only one of the peaks disappears . indeed , consider the coin state @xmath76 ) we find that the group - velocity density for this initial state reads @xmath77 such a density tends to zero for @xmath19 approaching @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the divergency at @xmath78 remains .",
    "we illustrate this feature in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we display the distribution after 100 steps for the coin parameter @xmath79 .",
    "after @xmath70 steps . as the initial coin state",
    "we have chosen @xmath80 given by equation ( [ sigma : l ] ) . in this case",
    "the peak on the right hand side of the lattice disappears , as predicted by the density ( [ dist : sigma : l ] ) illustrated with the red curve .",
    "the blue - dashed line depicts the localization probability ( [ loc : rho]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to conclude this section , we note that the characteristic features of this family of quantum walks are maintained for all values of the coin parameter @xmath10 , which scales the rate at which the walk spreads through the lattice .",
    "the three - state grover walk is a particular case corresponding to the case @xmath81 .",
    "the change of the basis of the coin space to the one formed by the eigenstates of the coin operator ( [ coin : rho ] ) allowed us to simplify the description of the walk considerably .",
    "consequently , interesting dynamical regimes which are otherwise hidden were easily identified .",
    "let us turn to the second family of quantum walks we have introduced in @xcite .",
    "the coin operators are in the standard basis of the coin space represented by the following matrix @xmath82 with the coin parameter @xmath83 . for the choice of @xmath84 the coin operator turns to the 3x3 grover matrix .",
    "we exclude the other boundary point @xmath85 from our consideration since in such a case the coin operator ( [ coin : phi ] ) reduces to a permutation matrix and the resulting quantum walk is trivial .",
    "the set of matrices ( [ coin : phi ] ) was constructed in @xcite as a special parametrization of the eigenvalues of the 3x3 grover matrix .",
    "it was shown that the evolution operators of quantum walks with the coin operators ( [ coin : phi ] ) maintain a point spectrum for all values of @xmath83 .",
    "hence , the family of quantum walks driven by such coins show the localization effect .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 determines the rate at which the walk spreads through the lattice .",
    "namely , we have shown in @xcite that the positions of the peaks after @xmath12 steps of the walk will be @xmath87 , where the peak velocity @xmath88 is given by @xmath89    before we proceed with the analysis of this family of quantum walks , we first choose a suitable basis in the coin space .",
    "we again employ the eigenstates of the coin operator ( [ coin : phi ] ) which are given by @xmath90 they satisfy the following eigenvalue equations @xmath91 we decompose the initial coin state @xmath14 into the eigenvector basis in the following form latexmath:[\\[\\label{init : phi }    where the probability amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath29 satisfy the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the group - velocity density of the family of quantum walks with coin operators ( [ coin : phi ] ) .",
    "we leave the details of the derivation for the appendix , where we show that it can be expressed in the following form @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have denoted @xmath94 the formula for the group - velocity ( [ dist : phi ] ) is much more involved than the one derived in the previous section ( see equation ( [ dist : rho ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dependence on the initial coin state is still relatively simple in the eigenvector basis . in particular",
    ", one can show that the even moments depend only on the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 of finding the particle initially in the coin state @xmath95 or @xmath96 . indeed ,",
    "note that all expressions defined in ( [ phi : terms ] ) are even functions of @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the first two terms in the group - velocity density ( [ dist : phi ] ) are even in @xmath19 , while the remaining two are odd .",
    "hence , only the first two terms of ( [ dist : phi ] ) contribute to the calculation of even moments . as an example , for the second moment we obtain the result @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the following integrals @xmath99 which have to be evaluated numerically for a given value of @xmath86 .",
    "we display the second moment as a function of the probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi:1 ] .",
    "the coin parameter @xmath86 was chosen as @xmath100 .",
    "the plot indicates that the greatest second moment is achieved for the eigenstate @xmath95 , while the smallest results from @xmath101 .    ) as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we have chosen the coin parameter @xmath102 .",
    "note the different scale in comparison with fig .",
    "the domain of the plot is restricted due to the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho]).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we note that the odd moments are determined by the last two terms of the group - velocity density ( [ dist : phi ] ) .",
    "hence , they are influenced by the coherence of the initial coin state .",
    "similarly to the previous model the group - velocity density ( [ dist : phi ] ) is not normalized since we find @xmath103 which differs from one unless @xmath71 .",
    "the remaining part of the probability is in the localization . concerning this part of the probability distribution we show in the appendix that it is completely independent of @xmath86 . hence , it coincides with the result for the three - state grover walk corresponding to the choice of @xmath84 .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , the grover walk also belongs to the eigenvector family we have studied in the previous section . using the result ( [ loc : rho ] ) for @xmath9 corresponding to the grover",
    "walk we find that the localization probability for three - state quantum walks with the coin ( [ coin : phi ] ) reads @xmath104 we can easily check that @xmath105 which together with ( [ dist : phi : norm ] ) and the normalization condition ( [ norm : init : rho ] ) guarantees that @xmath106    let us now illustrate our findings on several examples .",
    "for the choice of the coin parameter @xmath84 the walk reduces to the three - state grover walk and the group velocity density ( [ dist : phi ] ) simplifies enormously to @xmath107 note that this formula coincides with the result ( [ dist : rho ] ) of the previous section for the particular choice of @xmath9 .",
    "hence , all features we have discussed in section  [ sec2 ] apply to the choice of @xmath84 .",
    "in particular , the coin eigenstates will play a special role since they result in an extremal regime of the walk .",
    "for @xmath108 the role of coin eigenstates will be less prominent and most of the features we have found in section  [ sec2 ] diminish .",
    "the only exception is the behaviour of localization ( [ loc : phi ] ) which is completely independent of @xmath86 . as a consequence , choosing the eigenvector @xmath95 as the initial coin state of the walk will cancel localization for any value of the coin parameter @xmath86 .",
    "let us first consider the eigenstate @xmath109 . in the special case of @xmath84 the distribution will not have peaks at the edges , see fig .  [ fig1 ] for comparison .",
    "for very small values of the coin parameter , such as @xmath110 illustrated in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : phi:2 ] , the density bends down as @xmath19 approaches @xmath111 .",
    "nevertheless , the density depicted by the red curve does not converge to zero .",
    "instead , it diverges at @xmath112 for any non - zero value of the coin parameter @xmath86 . with increasing value @xmath86 the bending of the density diminish and",

    "this is illustrated in the upper plot where we choose @xmath110 . with increasing values of the coin parameter the density flattens , as depicted in the lower plot for @xmath115.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to conclude this section ,",
    "we have found that the transformation from the standard basis of the coin space to the eigenstate basis is fruitful also for the quantum walks with coin operators ( [ coin : phi ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the results obtained in the previous section , the present family does not preserve all features of the three - state grover walk .",
    "the exception is the behaviour of localization which is independent @xmath86 .",
    "the limit distributions of two families of three - state quantum walks closely related to the grover walk have been derived .",
    "the first family of quantum walks we have analyzed maintains all properties of the three - state grover walk .",
    "the coin parameter scales the spreading of the walk through the lattice .",
    "in contrast , for the second family of quantum walks the features of the three - state grover walk gradually diminish as the coin parameter increases .",
    "the only exception is the behaviour of localization which is the same for all quantum walks within this family .",
    "we have found that limit distributions of both families of quantum walks obtain a particularly simple form when we express the initial coin state in terms of the eigenvectors of the coin operator .",
    "this allowed us to reveal the extremal regimes of quantum walk dynamics .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the moments of the distribution on the initial condition can be analyzed in full detail .",
    "we have shown that the even moments and the localization probability at the origin depend only on the probabilities of finding the particle initially in the eigenstates of the coin operator .",
    "hence , an incoherent mixture of eigenstates yields in this respect the same results as a pure initial coin state , provided that the aforementioned probabilities are the same . on the other hand ,",
    "the odd moments and the localization probability outside the origin are determined by the coherence of the initial coin state .",
    "changing the basis of the coin space to the one formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator proved to be a very useful tool for the analysis of both families of quantum walks .",
    "we expect that this approach will be fruitful also in other models of quantum walks and that it will allow us to uncover otherwise hidden features .",
    "we appreciate the financial support from rvo  68407700 .",
    "m is grateful for the grant gar 14 - 02901p .",

    "in this appendix we derive the limit distribution of the three - state quantum walk with the coin ( [ coin : phi ] ) . in the fourier representation @xcite the evolution operator",
    "is given by @xmath116 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath117 where @xmath118 is determined by the dispersion relations @xmath119 the corresponding eigenvectors have the form @xmath120 where we have denoted by @xmath121 the normalization factors which reads @xmath122    we note that the first eigenvalue is independent of @xmath123 .",
    "hence , the eigenvector @xmath124 is a stationary state . as we will see later",
    "this eigenstate will determine the localization probability .",
    "the remaining eigenstates @xmath125 will contribute to the group - velocity density .",
    "let us begin with the localization probability that the particle will be found at position @xmath16 in the asymptotic limit @xmath126 .",
    "we denote by @xmath127 the fourier transformation of the initial state of the quantum walk @xmath128 .",
    "by @xmath129 we mark the overlaps between the eigenstates @xmath130 and @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath131 the probability amplitude of the particle being at position @xmath16 after @xmath12 steps of the walk is then given by @xmath132 it follows from the riemann - lebesque lemma that the two time - dependent integrals in ( [ psi : t ] ) vanish as @xmath12 approaches infinity .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath126 only the first term in ( [ psi : t ] ) remains and we find @xmath133 the localization probability @xmath57 that the particle is trapped at position @xmath16 as @xmath12 approaches infinity is then given by @xmath134 .",
    "we see that it depends solely on the stationary state @xmath135 .",
    "since @xmath135 is independent of the coin parameter @xmath86 the localization probability @xmath57 is the same for the whole family of quantum walks .",
    "the result coincides with the one for the three - state grover walk corresponding to the value @xmath84 .",
    "we now turn to the derivation of the group - velocity density .",
    "this can be deduced by calculating the moments of the particle s position in the fourier representation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the position of the particle after @xmath12 steps of the quantum walk .",
    "one can show @xcite that the @xmath136-th moment of the re - scaled position @xmath20 converges in the limit of @xmath50 . following the approach of @xcite we find that the limiting value of the moment is given by",
    "let us determine the overlap functions @xmath129 , respectively the term @xmath138 .",
    "we note that @xmath139 is an odd function of @xmath123 .",
    "hence , for even @xmath136 it is sufficient to find only the even part of @xmath140 , since the contribution of the odd part to the integral ( [ grover : moment ] ) is zero .",
    "similarly , for odd @xmath136 it is sufficient to determine the odd part of @xmath141 .",
    "to do this we consider the decomposition of the initial coin state @xmath14 in the eigenstate basis as in ( [ init : phi ] ) .",
    "the fourier transformation of the initial state of the walk @xmath128 is then given by @xmath142 with the explicit form of the eigenvectors ( [ eigen : v ] ) we then find that the even part of @xmath140 reads    @xmath143 in a similar way , the odd part of @xmath141 is given by @xmath144 the last part of the derivation of the group - velocity density is to make the substitution @xmath145 in the integral ( [ grover : moment ] ) , where the group - velocity @xmath19 is defined in ( [ group : v ] ) .",
    "the transformation from @xmath123 to @xmath19 is not unique and has to be done separately in two intervals . for @xmath146 , where @xmath147 we find from ( [ group : v ] ) the that the following relations hold @xmath148 similarly , in the interval @xmath149 we find the identities @xmath150 performing all steps of the substitution from @xmath123 to @xmath19 is quite tedious but after some algebra we find that the moments ( [ grover : moment ] ) can be re - written in the form @xmath151 where @xmath88 is the maximum of the group velocity @xmath152 which is achieved at @xmath153 .",
