    "successful realization of aneutronic fusion idea would greatly reduce problems associated with neutron radiation such as ionizing damage , neutron activation , and requirements for biological shielding , remote handling , and safety issues .",
    "one of the reactions discussed in this respect is the reaction p+@xmath1b@xmath2 .",
    "there are at least two proposals @xcite how to use this reaction for energy production .",
    "the shape of @xmath0-particles spectrum , especially its low energy tail is of crucial importance for realisation of these projects .",
    "existing measurements @xcite produce the spectra for fixed angles of @xmath0-particles that does not say much about integrated spectrum . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple theoretical model for the reaction amplitude allowing to calculate with some assumptions the shape of @xmath0-particle spectrum .",
    "the reaction p+@xmath1b@xmath4 has a well pronounced resonance at the proton energy 675 kev .",
    "the resonance corresponds to excited state of @xmath5 nucleus with the energy 16.57 mev , and with quantum numbers @xmath6 and isospin @xmath7 .",
    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath0-particle plus excited state of @xmath8 with the energy @xmath9 mev and quantum numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the cross section for decay into the ground state of @xmath8 is about two orders of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "the decay proceeds with isospin violation , therefore the width of the resonance is small enough . with",
    "the @xmath12-value @xmath13 mev the total width is @xmath14 mev .",
    "it leads to high cross section at the resonance peak @xmath15 b. @xcite .",
    "the decaying state has negative parity , therefore the primary emitted @xmath0 must be in the state with an odd angular momentum . in our case",
    "it can be @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the width of the excited @xmath8 state is 1.513 mev .",
    "it corresponds to lifetime @xmath18 s. during this time the primary @xmath0-particle is still within strong interaction range .",
    "it means that the decay is in fact a 3-body type .",
    "immediate consequence of it is that the energy of any @xmath0-particle can vary from 0 to @xmath19 , where @xmath12 is total @xmath12-value for the reaction , @xmath20 mev .    keeping in mind these features of the reaction",
    "the amplitude can be presented in the following general form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the emission vertex of the primary @xmath0-particle with the momentum @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the propagator of the intermediate system @xmath0-particle plus @xmath3 , and @xmath25 is the decay vertex of @xmath3 depending on relative momentum of two @xmath0-particles .",
    "the diagram corresponding to this process is shown in fig.1 .",
    "-particles.,width=188 ]    for unpolarized initial state an angular distribution of @xmath0-particle is isotropic .",
    "for this reason we omit angular dependence in the vertexes @xmath26 and @xmath27 and will discuss only their energy dependence .",
    "there are two factors determining momentum dependence of the vertexes at low momentum .",
    "first , it is a coulomb barrier that suppresses emission of low energy particles .",
    "second , it is a centrifugal barrier . with these factors",
    "the decay vertex of @xmath3 can be presented as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a relative velocity of @xmath0-particles in c.m .",
    "frame , and @xmath30 is the euler gamma - function .",
    "the value of the cut - off parameter @xmath31 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the nuclear radius .",
    "the shape of the @xmath0-particle spectrum appeared insensitive to exact value of @xmath31 . with this vertex",
    "we can define the energy dependent width by equation @xmath34 here @xmath0 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass of @xmath0-particle , and @xmath37 is the c.m .",
    "remaining parameter @xmath38 is determined by the width of the excited state of @xmath8 @xmath39 where @xmath40 mev .",
    "the vertex @xmath41 has similar structure @xmath42 here the coulomb barrier is larger , @xmath43 . as for centrifugal barrier , strictly speaking there are two partial waves with @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributing to this vertex . however , since we are interested in low energy tail of the @xmath0 s spectrum , we retained only @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the total width of the excited carbon state is small enough , @xmath44 mev , therefore , the momentum dependence is smooth in this energy range and does not influence the shape of the spectrum . as in the previous vertex",
    "the exact value of the cut - off parameter @xmath45 is not important .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is insensitive to it .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 is defined by normalization of the spectrum to one .",
    "a propagator @xmath24 of the intermediate @xmath47 state is of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy of the initial carbon state @xmath50 mev , and @xmath51 is the hamiltonian of @xmath47 system . omitting @xmath52 interaction and retaining only the width of @xmath53 state we obtain @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the laboratory kinetic energies of @xmath0-particle and @xmath8 . introducing @xmath12-value for this transition we obtain , @xmath57 where we used the relation @xmath58 .",
    "the center of mass energy @xmath37 in @xmath59 is defined by total @xmath12-value minus kinetic energy of @xmath0 and @xmath8 , @xmath60 .    in the final state",
    "we have three identical bose - particles .",
    "therefore , the amplitude eq.([1 ] ) should be properly symmetrized .",
    "the full amplitude is as follows @xmath61",
    "with the amplitude eq.([9 ] ) we can calculate the spectrum of @xmath0-particles .",
    "@xmath62 as usual , the line over the amplitude squared means averaging over initial spin projections and summation over angular momentum projections of @xmath0-particles .",
    "after that the spectrum becomes isotropic . strictly speaking",
    ", the interference terms in the amplitude squared may depend on the angle between @xmath23 and @xmath63 .",
    "however , the scalar product @xmath64 is fixed by delta - function in eq.([10 ] ) . the delta - function in eq.([10 ] ) means that we neglected the small width of the initial excited carbon state .",
    "integration over angles removes delta - function , we obtain @xmath65 integrating eq.([11 ] ) over @xmath66 we obtain the final equation for @xmath0-particle spectrum @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath71 defined by the condition @xmath72 the calculated spectrum is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the spectrum has a well pronounced peak corresponding to emission of primary @xmath0-particle and a broad shoulder going down to very low energy .",
    "this low energy tail contains 11% of @xmath0-particles with the energy less than 1 mev , and 17,5% of @xmath0-particles with the energy less than 1.5 mev .",
    "it is worth to see how important are the coulomb and the centrifugal factors included in the vertexes in eq.([2 ] ) . to do this we calculated the spectrum using constant @xmath73 mev and constant @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in fig.3",
    "we show the spectrum obtained in this way ( dashed line ) and the full spectrum from fig.2 .",
    "the main difference is in the peak position which is shifted downward for @xmath76 mev and an increase of number of @xmath0-particles with the energies between 2.5 and 3.8 mev .",
    "note that in this region all three @xmath0-particles have the energies close to each other . in this region",
    "the effect of interference of three terms in eq.([9 ] ) is strong .",
    "the low energy tail is almost insensitive to it .    in summary",
    ", using a simple phenomenological model for the reaction amplitude the shape of the @xmath0-particle spectrum has been calculated .",
    "basing on the obtained shape we estimated the number of low energy @xmath0 s .",
    "we found 17.5% of @xmath0 s below 1.5 mev and 11% below 1 mev .",
