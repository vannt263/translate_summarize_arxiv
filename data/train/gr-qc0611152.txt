    "in general relativity , the description of particle motion is usually not so illustrative as in the classical physics , where the newtonian forces can be routinely used .",
    "however , using the optical reference geometry given by m. abramowicz and his co - workers @xcite , we can define forces which surprisingly enables us to describe the relativistic dynamics in accordance with our natural newtonian intuition .",
    "moreover , many important properties of relativistic dynamics in terms of the forces can be effectively illustrated by the properties of embedding diagrams of the optical reference geometry @xcite .",
    "these are just the main advantages of the forces defined by m. abramowicz compared to a number of other forces defined in the framework of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the forces related to the optical reference geometry were exploited in many papers in the case of various types of spacetimes @xcite .",
    "here we consider physical relevant stationary and axially symmetric backgrounds around rotating black holes or naked singularities in the universe with recently indicated repulsive cosmological constant , i.e. , kerr - de  sitter ( kds hereinafter ) spacetimes .",
    "black - hole spacetimes with a non - zero cosmological constant were treated in terms of the optical reference geometry in the simplest , spherically symmetric cases of the schwarzschild - de  sitter ( sds hereinafter ) and reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetimes @xcite . in the later case ,",
    "naked - singularity spacetimes appear along with black - hole spacetimes .    in section 2 , a brief summary of the abramowicz definition of the forces in the framework of optical reference geometry is given .",
    "it is shown that in the special reference frame of general stationary spacetimes , the motion of test particles can be described by using gravitational , centrifugal , coriolis , and euler forces .",
    "the behavior of these forces can be elucidated in many cases of the test particle motion . in this paper , we focus on the forces acting on particles in stationary motion along circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the stationary , axially symmetric kds spacetimes . in section 3 , we give general form of the forces ( naturally , the euler force vanishes in the case of the stationary circular motion ) and in section 4 , we summarize basic features of the kds geometry .",
    "the fundamental properties of the forces are discussed in section 5 .",
    "we show that in a given spacetime , there are several circular orbits where the gravitational force vanishes and changes its orientation and , generally , several other orbits where the centrifugal force vanishes and changes its orientation independently of the velocity of test particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the coriolis force does not vanish for non - zero velocity .",
    "we also discuss the vanishing and change of orientation of the forces in the limit cases of the kds spacetimes , i.e. , in the kerr and sds spacetimes , which clearly demonstrates the influence of the cosmological constant and rotation of the central object on moving test particles . in section 6 , some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "in a stationary spacetime described by a metric @xmath0 ( with signature + 2 ) , we can assume a family of special observers with a timelike and unit 4-velocity field @xmath1 and with its field equal to the gradient of a scalar function called gravitational potential , i.e. , @xcite @xmath2 it is useful ( but not necessary for the definition of the forces ) to require the vector field @xmath3 to satisfy the condition of hypersurface orthogonality @xmath4}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can find at least two solutions of the equations  ( [ 1 ] ) ; @xmath5 and @xmath3 corresponding to the field of freely falling ( geodesic ) observers or @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to the field of stationary observers . in the second case , @xmath3 is the unit vector field parallel to the timelike killing vector field @xmath8 , which exists due to the spacetime stationarity .",
    "the equation @xmath9 following from the equations  ( [ 1 ] ) , suggests that the special observers with the @xmath3 observe no change in the gravitational potential as their proper time passes .",
    "it means the observers are fixed with respect to the _",
    "gravitational field_. the local instantaneous ( @xmath3 orthogonal ) space of the observers is described by the metric @xmath10 the so - called _ directly projected geometry_. it is useful to define the conformally adjusted metric of the spacetime @xmath11 and the conformally adjusted metric of the directly projected geometry @xmath12 the so - called _ optical reference geometry_.    the @xmath13 of a test particle with a rest mass @xmath14 can be decomposed into the time part and the spatial part ( @xmath3 orthogonal ) in the reference frame of the special observers with the @xmath3 by using the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unit spacelike vector ( @xmath3 orthogonal ) along with the with the magnitude @xmath17 ( measured by special observers ) is aligned . the quantity @xmath18 is the lorentz factor , i.e. , the normalization factor that makes @xmath19 . moreover , there are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the projection tensor allowing the special observer to define quantities by projecting quantities into his local instantaneous space .",

    "note that @xmath16 is defined only along the world line of the particle .",
    "but in our construction , it is necessary to know how @xmath16 changes along @xmath3 .",
    "this can be done in several different ways ( different gauges ) .",
    "the gauge used by m. abramowicz and his co - workers assures that the lie derivate of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath33 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath34 , which causes that the coriolis force defined below vanishes in static spacetimes @xcite .    by projecting the  ( [ 10 ] ) into the space and by using the condition of hypersurface orthogonality  ( [ 3 ] ) , we arrive at the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "a real force acting on a particle ( for example a thrust of rocket orbiting a black hole ) in the space can be expressed by the relation @xmath38 .",
    "this equation can be rewritten to the form @xmath39 , which suggests that the particle is not accelerated in its own comoving frame and the real force is balanced by the inertial force @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 . due to the formula  ( [ 11 ] ) , we can decompose this inertial force into the sum of the gravitational @xmath42 , centrifugal @xmath43 , coriolis @xmath44 , and euler @xmath45 forces , which are familiar from the newtonian physics @xmath46 where @xmath47 note that in the context of the optical geometry relativistic approach , the gravitational force ranks among the inertial forces .",
    "stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes admit two killing vector fields : the timelike vector field @xmath48 and the spacelike vector field @xmath49 .",
    "these killing vector fields are not orthogonal in general and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "their combination , especially @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , can be used for the definition of the special observers @xmath55.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this , relevant for the construction of the ordinary projected geometry , corresponds to the of the locally non - rotating frames moving along circular orbits with the angular velocity @xmath56 .",
    "the timelike vector field ( [ 30 ] ) is the unit and hypersurface orthogonal vector field , whereas its equals to the gradient of the scalar function @xmath57 , just as required in the equations  ( [ 1 ] ) and  ( [ 3 ] ) . on the other hand , the @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "corresponding to the circular motion of test particle with the angular velocity @xmath59 is not hypersurface orthogonal , i.e. , it does not satisfy the condition  ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "just this property of the of special observers , i.e. , @xmath3 being hypersurface orthogonal , naturally ensures that the unit vector @xmath16 , used in the decomposition  ( [ 8 ] ) , is located in the hypersurface .",
    "moreover , due to the circular orbits , it is directed along the killing vector @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 thus by using relations  ( [ 31 ] ) and  ( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain the lorentz factor and the velocity in the form @xmath62 note that @xmath63 is equivalent to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    using the general forms of the inertial forces  ( [ 13])-([16 ] ) ( dropping the superscript  @xmath66 ) and the relations  ( [ 31])-([34 ] ) , we arrive at the expressions for components of the gravitational , centrifugal , and coriolis forces acting on the particle moving along the circular orbit with @xmath67 @xmath68,\\\\ \\label{37 } c_k&=&m\\gamma^{2}v\\ , ( \\xi^i\\xi_i)^{-3/2}e^{-\\phi}[\\xi^i\\xi_i\\nabla_{k}{(\\eta^i\\xi_i)}-\\eta^i\\xi_i\\nabla_k(\\xi^i\\xi_i)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the euler force @xmath69 is non - zero in the case of @xmath70 , being determined by @xmath71 . due to the axial symmetry and stationarity of the spacetimes ,",
    "the @xmath72 and @xmath73-components vanish .",
    "we will focus on the inertial forces acting on particles moving only in the equatorial plane  ( @xmath74 ) where also the @xmath75-components vanish .",
    "the gravitational force is velocity - independent , the centrifugal force depends on the second power of the velocity , and the coriolis force depends on the first power of the velocity .",
    "this indicates the newtonian character of the forces .",
    "moreover , the acceleration necessary to keep a particle in a stationary motion with a velocity along a circular orbit @xmath76 in the equatorial plane can be expressed in a very simple form @xmath77 where @xmath78,\\\\ \\label{44 } \\mathcal{c}&=&\\frac{c_r}{m\\gamma^{2}v}=(\\xi^i\\xi_i)^{-3/2}e^{-\\phi}[\\xi^i\\xi_i\\nabla_{r}(\\eta^i\\xi_i)-\\eta^i\\xi_i\\nabla_{r}(\\xi^i\\xi_i)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are mass and velocity independent parts of the @xmath79-components of the forces .",
