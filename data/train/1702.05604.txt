    "in a famous thought experiment maxwell envisioned a method for apparently defying the second law of thermodynamics by means of a feedback control mechanism @xcite .",
    "maxwell s idea is based on a malicious demon , an intelligent being that is able to observe the microscopic dynamics of a system , and act on it so as to steer it toward defying the second law . in maxwell s original concept ,",
    "the system is a container with two chambers , containing respectively a hot gas and a cold gas .",
    "the two chambers are separated by a wall presenting a trap - door which the demon can open and close at will .",
    "the demon observes the erratic motion of the gas particle and when sees a cold particle approaching the trap - door , she / he swiftly opens the door as to let the particle go through and closes it immediately afterwards .",
    "in this way , particle after particle , heat flows from the cold chamber to the hot chamber in contradiction with the second law .",
    "advance in nanotechnology has made the possibility of bringing maxwell demons from the realm of thought experiments to the realm of real experiments @xcite .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies so far have focused mainly on situations where feedback control is operated as a measurement - conditioned driving on some working substance ( classical or quantum ) coupled to a single temperature , so as to withdraw energy from the latter in contradiction with the second law as formulated by kelvin .",
    "interesting realistic proposals have appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite . situations as originally envisaged by maxwell where heat flows between different temperature reservoirs is controlled , however have not been addressed so far , neither theoretically nor experimentally .",
    "the main result of the present work is that of filling that gap . in the following",
    "we shall present the general theory of feedback controlled heat transport in quantum devices , and shall describe a possible experimental realisation thereof .",
    "the theory presented here builds on previous works concerning fluctuation relations in presence of measurements without feedback @xcite and with feedback @xcite , combined with an inclusive approach where quantum heat engines are seen as mechanically driven multipartite systems starting in a multi - temperature initial state @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite reported on the theory of a one - measurement based feedback control on a quantum working - substance prepared by contact with a single bath . that formalism is here extended to the case of many heat baths , and also repeated measurements , to allow for the study of continuous feedback control of heat flow in a multi reservoir scenario .",
    "previous work concerning repeated measurements appeared in refs @xcite for classical systems in contact with a single bath .",
    "fluctuation relations need to be modified by a mutual information term , which we shall explicitely provide .",
    "this experimental proposal is based on the fast developing advancements in experimental solid state low temperature techniques : in particular the calorimetric measurement scheme that has been put forward by one of us and co - workers @xcite . as proven by some recent theoretical proposals",
    "@xcite the method opens up a new avenue for the practical management of heat and work on a chip by means of superconducting devices , particularly superconducting qubits .",
    "here we illustrate the possible implementation of very simple feedback controlled heat transport where the trapdoor is realised by a superconducting qubit whose coupling with two resistors at different temperatures is controlled based on the outcomes of continuous calorimetric monitoring of the resistors themselves .    .",

    "the quantum channel @xmath58 is generally not unital , as a consequence its adjoint is generally not trace preserving , hence we have generally @xmath59 .",

    "feedback , implying explicit dependence on @xmath69 of @xmath68 breaks unitality .",
    "unitality would occur also in the case when @xmath73 $ ] does not depend on @xmath74 , meaning the measurement outcome @xmath69 is completely random and has no correlation with the actual state @xmath74 . in sum if the feedback control measurement is off , either because one decides not to use the information gathered in the measurement , or because the measurement gathers no information in the first place , unitality is recovered , and the fluctuation theorem is restored .",
    "this result is in agreement with the established fact that projective measurements without feedback control do not alter the validity of the fluctuation theorem @xcite .",

    "this allows to study maxwell s demons of the very type originally envisioned by maxwell .",
    "the progress of solid state technology on the other hand allows to realise such feedback controlled heat transport mechanisms in real devices .",
    "the proposal that we put forward here is based on two ingredients that enable unique capabilities allowing for the implementation of a maxwell demon based on a most simple concept .",
    "the two ingredients are a two - level - system acting as quantum trap door and the calorimetric measurement scheme developed in refs . @xcite .",

    "the two - level system is embodied by a superconducting qubit of level spacing @xmath121 .",
    "the two chambers are embodied by two resistors being kept at different temperatures .",
    "qubit and resistors con exchange energy ( i.e. heat ) in the form of photons of energy @xmath121 associated to the tls absorbing / emitting one photon from / to one of the two baths .",
    "the resistors are embedded into an rlc loop of tunable resonance frequency .",
    "this results into a tuneable tls / resistor coupling .",
    "when an rlc circuit is far detuned from @xmath122 , the qubit is effectively decoupled from the resistor , while maximal coupling occurs when it is in tune with the qubit .",
    "the resonance frequency can be tuned by using a squid as a non - linear and tuneable inductor , its inductance being governed by a controllable threading magnetic flux .    when a photon enters / exits one of the two resistors , its electronic temperature undergoes a positive / negative jump followed by a fast decay .",
    "two calorimeters @xcite continuously monitor the two resistors , and count how many photons enter / exit them .",
    "this allows for a directional full counting statistics of heat .",
    "most remarkably it also allows to infer the state of the tls at each time .",
    "if an absorption ( in either resistor ) is observed , it means the tls jumped down , hence it was up before the absorption was detected , and is down afterwards .",
    "this allows to experimentally access the quantum state trajectory of the tls .",
    "the feedback concept is extremely simple : as soon as a jump - down is observed , turn on the interaction with the cold resistor and turn off the interaction with the hot resistor .",
    "vice - versa for the observation of a jump up .",
    "this results in a net flow of heat from the cold resistor to the hot one .",
    "based on the above general analysis the apparent violation of the second law is understood in terms of lack of time - reversal symmetry of feedback control , leading to an overall non - unital dynamics of resistors plus tls . in a practical realisation one is realistically not able to fully turn off the interactions .",
    "furthermore there will be some delay time @xmath123 between measurement being performed and feedback being realised , giving rise effectively to possible error @xmath124 $ ] between measured state @xmath91 and actual state @xmath51 of the qubit .",
