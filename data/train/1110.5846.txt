    "merton @xcite , black and cox @xcite , and other pioneering researchers in credit risk well understood that dynamics of a firm s equity and debt should be modeled jointly and that credit derivatives and equity derivatives are linked inextricably . to this day , however , it has proved difficult to capture the dynamical essence of these two aspects of a firm s capitalization .",
    "the papers by leland @xcite and leland and toft @xcite provide a conceptual basis , but they remain strongly attached to the framework of diffusion processes and have a one dimensional source of randomness .",
    "the above structural models can all be classified as one - factor models with the asset process as the only underlying source of randomness .",
    "such models have the severe limitation that the firm s equity and debt are perfectly correlated ( i.e. they are related by a deterministic function ) , while it is clear in real life that firms , to a greater or lesser extent , have stochastic liabilities that are not perfectly correlated with assets . as an extreme illustration , hedge funds , with their long / short positions ,",
    "typically have liabilities as volatile as their assets .",
    "thus the fact is clear that to accurately model capital structure , a stochastic factor process of dimension at least two is necessary . in the context of continuous time finance ,",
    "the technical and computational challenges implied by this fact have not yet been satisfactorily addressed , and these challenges are the main focus of the present paper .",
    "only a few authors have been able to make substantial headway in modeling actual observed capital structures by two factor models .",
    "eberlein and madan @xcite , in a recent working paper , have treated firm asset and liabilities as imperfectly correlated processes .",
    "equity equals the asset / liability spread , and they use this fact to calibrate both the asset and liability values from the observations of a firm s implied equity volatility surface .    a second deficiency in the standard structural framework is the reliance on diffusion processes , with the consequence that default events are predictable and so instantaneous default is either certain or impossible @xcite .",
    "thus in such models the short spreads are either infinity or zero , counter to the fact that short spreads are observed to be positive even for investment grade firms . the natural way to overcome",
    "this deficiency is to introduce jumps into the asset process .",
    "a number of authors , notably @xcite,@xcite ,  have successfully implemented jump diffusion and pure jump versions of the merton model .",
    "however they share that model s unrealistically simple debt structure .",
    "similar extensions to the black - cox first passage framework , however , have had only a limited success , due to the technical difficulty of solving the first passage problem for jump processes .",
    "the kou - wang model @xcite with exponentially distributed jumps was able to work because of the special nature of the underlying process .",
    "this difficulty with predictable defaults was the original motivation for replacing structural models by reduced form models @xcite and incomplete information models @xcite .",
    "recently , a class of `` hybrid '' reduced form models that include the stock price and a default hazard process have been developed .",
    "these model equity and debt products more realistically by allowing the stock price to jump to zero at the time of default . carr and wu @xcite take a stochastic volatility model for the stock price and assume that the default arrival rate is driven by the volatility and another independent credit risk factor . in carr and linetsky @xcite , the stock price has a local volatility with constant elasticity of variance , and the default intensity is specified as an affine function of the instantaneous variance of the stock .",
    "@xcite obtain even more generality while retaining analytic tractability by applying a time change to the hazard rate and stock price processes .",
    "all three frameworks are able to capture the so called leverage effect and the co - movement between volatility and default intensity .    within the structural credit modeling framework",
    ", @xcite generalizes the black - cox model by treating the log - leverage ratio @xmath0 as a time - changed brownian motion ( tcbm ) , where @xmath1 denotes the ( per - share ) firm asset value process discounted at a constant rate @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a deterministic default threshold .",
    "the time of default is the first passage time for the log - leverage ratio to cross zero . like other structural approaches along these lines ,",
    "this model cure the inconsistency with observed short spreads and add the flexibility to include jumps to default and volatility clustering .",
    "one contribution of the tcbm approach in @xcite lies in an innovative mathematical treatment of the first passage to default that allows the reflection principle and corresponding first passage formulas for brownian motion to extend to a broader class of processes , leading to analytical tractability in a more general setting .",
    "the object of the present paper is demonstrate how to embed the black - cox framework in a simple way into a two - factor framework that allows the firm s equity and debt to be partially correlated while retaining tractability of the underlying default model .",
    "we do this by treating the default threshold @xmath4 as a positive stochastic process @xmath5 that we can think of as the market value of the firm s liabilities , per share .",
    "put another way , we treat the firm s debt or liability as a new stochastic process , not fully correlated with the asset process @xmath6 .",
    "if we consider as well the stock price @xmath7 ( assuming the number of shares is constant and the firm pays no dividends ) and the log - leverage @xmath8 , then a minimal set of additional assumptions for combining these processes is :    the pre - default dynamics of any two of the four processes @xmath9 is markovian and time - homogeneous , and determines the dynamics of the remaining two processes by the equations [ firmeqns ] s_t=(v_t - d_t,0),x_t = v_t / d_t .",
    "we assume that the discounted processes @xmath10 are martingales under some risk neutral measure @xmath11 , and the interest rate @xmath2 is constant be a martingale , we make a stronger assumption to simplify the framework . ] .",
    "the time of default is = \\{t|x_t0}=\\{t|s_t=0 } , and after default @xmath12 . at the time of default ,",
    "all securities are assumed to be valued in terms of a `` recovery '' random variable @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we will make additional restrictive assumptions on the form of @xmath14 to obtain a workable tractable framework . under these restrictions",
    ", the pure credit dynamics of two factor models with a constant recovery will be consistent with the tcbm credit framework of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "good calibrations of such credit models to a large dataset of cds spreads for ford motor company were obtained , thus verifying the quality of the framework as a model for credit risk .",
    "in addition our two - factor models price equity options as barrier spread options on @xmath15 .",
    "thus option pricing in two factor models faces the type of computational challenges for spread options that have been studied in such papers as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are able to use the tcbm structure and properties of brownian motion to develop an efficient equity option pricing algorithm that uses a two dimensional fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "such a fast algorithm is needed not just in the forward direction for security pricing , but more importantly to solve the \" inverse problem  that arises in calibration to a dataset of observed security prices . in this paper , because we have efficient pricing of the basic securities to be used in the calibration , we are able to demonstrate the feasibility of efficient statistical estimation of two factor models to a dataset of cds curves and implied equity volatility surfaces",
    ".    the above assumptions on the firm s capital structure can only be valid for a period @xmath16 $ ] over which the firm pays no dividends or debt coupons , and does not issue new shares or debt .",
    "a consistent firm model that incorporates such real world features will also be of interest for future research .",
    "this paper will discuss several implementations of the two - factor framework where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are discounted martingales .",
    "in all these implementations , we are able to overcome the two technical obstacles , namely the treatment of the first passage to default and the efficient computation of spread options . in  2 and  3",
    "we investigate the case where @xmath6 and @xmath19 are correlated geometric brownian motions ( gbms ) .",
    "the resultant default model extends the black - cox model and shares its known shortcomings , such as zero short spreads .",
    "as well it tends to generate rather unrealistic implied volatility surfaces .",
    "therefore in  4 we allow @xmath6 and @xmath19 to be lvy subordinated brownian motions ( lsbms ) driven by a single time change , in this case either a gamma process or a process with exponential distributed jumps .",
    "we investigate some of the possible shapes of both the cds curve and the implied vol surface . in  5 , we investigate how to calibrate such models to market cds and implied vol data on a single date .",
    "we then exhibit the results of a simple calibration of the gbm and lsbm models to data for a typical default risky firm , ford motor company .",
    "finally ,  6 offers a summary and some directions for future exploration .",
    "as we have explained , the firm s capitalization is modeled by the four processes @xmath20 satisfying assumption , and default @xmath21 is the first time @xmath22 , or equivalently when @xmath23 .",
    "we work in a risk - neutral filtered probability space @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are adapted to the filtration @xmath26 and @xmath21 is an @xmath26 stopping time . if @xmath27 denotes the `` market filtration '' , note that the stock price @xmath7 is @xmath28 measurable , whereas @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not . in practice @xmath31",
    "must be inferred from the prices of securities trading on the firm , and possibly its quarterly balance sheets .    in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that the price of basic credit and equity derivatives can be reduced to computations involving the joint characteristic function of @xmath32 $ ] conditioned on non - default at time @xmath33 : _",
    "nd(u_1,u_2;t;v_0,d_0):= ^_v_0,d_0[e^i(u_1 v_t+u_2 d_t)*1*_\\{t^*>t } ]  .",
    "[ phinddef]as a special case , note that the probability of no default at time @xmath33 is : [ nodefault ] p(t;v_0,d_0)=_nd(0,0;t;v_0,d_0)=^_v_0,d_0[*1*_\\{t^*>t } ]",
    ".    the reader can anticipate that in subsequent sections , we will introduce a number of models of dynamics where a generalized reflection principle holds and implies that computations involving @xmath34 can be reduced to computations involving the unconstrained characteristic function ( u_1,u_2;t;v_0,d_0):= ^_v_0,d_0[e^i(u_1 v_t+u_2 d_t ) ]  .",

    "however , to avoid a detailed analysis of stochastic recovery modeling , we make a mathematically simple hypothesis :    the recovery value of a zero coupon bond with maturity @xmath33 , at the time of default @xmath48 is a constant @xmath50 .",
    "this assumption is analogous to the recovery of par mechanism often made in credit risk modeling , and it shares some of its limitations . then one has the risk - neutral valuation formula for the pre - default price @xmath51 at time @xmath46 of the maturity @xmath33 zero coupon bond : [ bondformula ] b_t(t)= ^_v_0,d_0  , which leads to :    1 .   the pre - default price at time @xmath46 of a zero coupon bond with maturity @xmath33 with recovery of par is given by b_t(t)=e^-r(t - t)p(t - t;v_t , d_t ) + r e^-r(t - t)(1-p(t - t;v_t , d_t ) )  .",

    "therefore in our calibration , we did not use implied volatility data with extreme moneyness @xmath157 and with short time to maturity ( ttm ) @xmath158 calendar days .      to test the gbm , exp and vg models described above , we performed independent daily calibrations to the data observed on the above two dates , making use of the model formulas and .",
    "we mention that we adjusted these formulas to incorporate the yield curve @xmath159 obtained from a boot - strap of the observed us treasury yields , by the replacement of all discount factors @xmath160 with corresponding factors @xmath161 .",
    "it is natural to assume that stock prices are perfectly liquid and hence are perfect observations of the process @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "on the other hand , cds and equity option markets are much less liquid therefore the @xmath163 observed cds spreads and @xmath164 observed implied volatilities are not assumed to match our model prices exactly .",
    "thus at any moment , @xmath7 is exactly observed , while @xmath8 must be filtered from the market data .",
    "on any given date @xmath46 , under these assumptions , the risk neutral parameters for both lsbm models to be calibrated are @xmath165 .",
    "the gbm hybrid model nests inside both lsbm models for any value of @xmath166 as the limit with @xmath167 .",
    "our method is a relative least - squares minimization of the error between the model and market cds spreads and implied volatilities observed at a single instant in time . for each @xmath168 ,",
    "let @xmath169 and @xmath170 denote market and model cds spread with maturity @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , for each @xmath171 and @xmath172 let @xmath173 and @xmath174 denote the observed and model implied volatilities with the given @xmath175 .",
    "the objective function to be minimized is a sum of squared relative errors .",
    "we introduce a weight factor between the cds and iv terms to offset a natural overweighting stemming from the large number of equity securities relative to the credit securities . without this factor , the iv terms would dominate the calibration and wash out the credit effects we aim to capture .",
    "thus we define the objective function to be @xmath176 where the subjective value @xmath177 is chosen to provide a nice balance between the credit and equity datasets .",
    "the model calibration is required to minimize @xmath178 over the domain @xmath179 : @xmath180    the above objective function corresponds to the measurement hypothesis that individual spreads and implied volatilities are observed with independent gaussian relative errors .",
    "of course , this is likely far from true since in reality , the raw data has been `` cleaned up '' and transformed by bloomberg in many different ways .",
    "another important point is that the weight @xmath177 in our objective function was chosen by us subjectively to give a nice balance between the credit and equity datasets .",
    "we tried other two choices of weighting schemes , @xmath181 and a version weighted by squared bid / ask spreads .",
    "both these schemes turn out to under - weight cds data resulting in a good fit to equity options while ruining the fit to cds spreads .",
    "the calibration was implemented on a laptop using standard matlab .",
    "minimization of @xmath178 was implemented using a quasi - newton optimization algorithm within matlab s function `` fmincon '' : typically around 200 evaluations of @xmath178 were needed to find an acceptable minimum . the model cds and call option prices entering @xmath178",
    "are computed by one and two dimensional fast fourier transforms using matlab s functions `` fft '' and `` fft2 '' .",
    "since each fft2 is computationally intensive , and calibration involves a great number of evaluations , it was effective to use interpolation from a single grid of fft - generated prices to compute the range of option prices across moneyness .",
    "we used the truncation and discretization error analysis in @xcite to optimize these computations . during the calibration",
    ", we found that the down - and - in barrier option terms in are always much smaller than the vanilla terms .",
    "this can be explained because the credit quality of ford is reasonably high , and therefore the linear transformation @xmath182 generates a point @xmath183 equivalent to a deep out - of - the - money vanilla spread option .",
    "the calibration results for the three models and two dates are shown in table [ calibration1 ] , and figures 1- 9 show the model and observed cds and implied volatility curves in each of these cases .",
    "we see that both the exp and vg models lead to cds and iv curves that capture the correct levels and quantitative features of the market data . on the other hand ,",
    "the gbm hybrid model is able to provide a qualitative , not quantitative , fit to the observed market data on the early date , but fails to capture the curves observed on the later date . as a stochastic volatility model , and unlike the black - scholes model , it does generate an implied volatility smile , but the details of the fitted shapes are not very good .",
    "one important point is that both lsbm models ( but not the gbm model ) on both dates lead to the implied recovery value @xmath184 , at the boundary of the parameter domain and counter to common sense . since reducing @xmath13 to zero",
    "raises the level of cds curves while leaving iv curves unchanged , this observation suggests a mismatch of risk neutral pricing between equity and credit markets .",
    "if the observed cds spreads are somewhat high relative to the level of the implied volatility surface , the calibration will be forced to choose a zero recovery rate in order to narrow the gap as much as possible . in our calibrations",
    "it appears that this gap is completely closed with @xmath184 .",
    "a similar observation has been made and discussed in carr and wu @xcite who find a zero recovery rate for 6 out of 8 companies studied , leaving a significant gap between model prices and market quotes .",
    "table [ firmvaluations ] records the balance sheet entries @xmath185 implied by each of these calibrations and , for comparison , the summary asset and liability values taken from ford s quarterly reports on the dates closest to the calibration dates .",
    "clearly there is no obvious direct correspondence between the balance sheet and market values ( which appear to be quite sensitive to the choice of model ) .",
    "it will be a nontrivial task for the future to investigate the extent to which the balance sheet numbers can be predicted by the market implied values .",
    "we have shown that simple capital structure models that treat the firm value and debt value as correlated stochastic processes can simultaneously capture key empirical features of prices observed in credit and equity markets .",
    "this framework is a significant extension of the standard structural credit risk framework that treats the firm s debt as deterministic or constant over time .",
    "we have shown that the necessary pricing computations for vanilla equity options and cds spreads reduce to explicit one and two dimensional fourier transforms , and so implementation of such models is comparable in difficulty to lvy process models now used routinely by banks .",
    "these promising results indicate that it will be worthwhile exploring the performance these models on a variety of firms from different countries and sectors .",
    "it will also be of interest to explore improvements that may come by using other types of time change .",
    "it is in principle quite straightforward to move beyond the present tcbm model with lvy subordinators to a far broader modeling framework of time - changed brownian motions .",
    "a range of implementation and calibration issues will be encountered when considering general tcbms , notably stochastic volatility and jump effects , and addressing such issues will make this a major research and development undertaking .",

    "<S> we extend the now classic structural credit modeling approach of black and cox to a class of `` two - factor '' models that unify equity securities such as options written on the stock price , and credit products like bonds and credit default swaps . in our approach , the two sides of the stylized balance sheet of a firm , namely the asset value and debt value , are assumed to follow a two dimensional markov process . amongst models of this type we find examples that lead to derivative pricing formulas that are capable of reproducing the main features of well known equity models such as the variance gamma model , and at the same time reproducing the stylized facts about default stemming from structural models of credit risk . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in contrast to one - factor structural models , these models allow for much more flexible dependence between equity and credit markets . </S>",
    "<S> two main technical obstacles to efficient implementation of these pricing formulas are overcome in our paper . </S>",
    "<S> the first obstacle stems from the barrier condition implied by the non - default of the firm , and is overcome by the idea of time - changing brownian motion in a way that preserves the reflection principle for brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> the second obstacle is the difficulty of computing spread options : this is overcome by using results in recent papers that make efficient use of the two dimensional fast fourier transform .    </S>",
