    "finally , signatures of sg stars ( na , al enhancements and o , mg depletions ) are more and more used to retrieve a cluster origin for streams ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * sesar  2015 ) : ophiuchus stream ; ( * ? ? ?",

    "* nissen & schuster 2010 ) ) and their abundances are clearly similar to those observed in dwarf satellites of milky way .",
    "therefore , we may infer that a minority of halo stars has a composition similar to the dwarfs , but the bulk of halo stars looks like the fg component of gcs ( red filled squares in fig .",

    "the basic assumptions for a large contribution of gc stars to the halo ( initial masses much larger , with selective loss of fg stars ) must confront with two major challenges .",
