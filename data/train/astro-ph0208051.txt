    "in the circumstellar envelope of agb stars , both the main line ( 1665 and 1667 mhz ) and the satellite line ( 1612 mhz ) oh maser transitions have been observed extensively .",
    "the 1612 mhz masers occur at  @xmath0  cm from the central star .",
    "the 1612 mhz maser line profile often shows a characteristic double peaked spectrum that is assumed to be the signature of an expanding shell ( e.g. reid et al .",
    "the exact shape however , is determined by local conditions in the maser shell and the level of saturation .",
    "recently it has been suggested that emission from the radio - sphere of the star will be amplified by the maser screen in front of the star .",
    "this amplification will cause a bright maser spots with several observable characteristics ( vlemmings , 2000 ) .",
    "strong evidence for this theory was presented recently when the most blue - shifted 1667 mhz maser spot of u  her was found to coincide with the hipparcos optical position to within 15 mas ( van langevelde et al . , 2000 & these proceedings )    modeling the various observed shapes of the maser profile by , and examining the effect of a background star are the main goals of this work .",
    "maser emission is highly anisotropic as a result of beaming due to the maser geometry and the structure of velocity coherent paths through the medium .",
    "additional anisotropy can be caused by density or pumping inhomogeneities and the contributions of the background source .",
    "this means that full 3-dimensional modeling is essential to accurately describe the maser .",
    "the first results are presented in fig.1 for a typical oh shell with and without a background star .",
    "the expansion velocity is @xmath1  km / s and the oh number density is @xmath2  @xmath3 throughout the maser shell . as can be seen ,",
    "the effect of a background star on the oh maser spectrum is small , while the high resolution channel map clearly shows the high brightness stellar image ."
