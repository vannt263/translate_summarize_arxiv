    "game theory deals with a situation where each player s payoff is dependent not only on her own behavior but also on other players. players will generally have conflicting interests with each other , but they may get better off by interacting with others in various ways  @xcite . for example , in the minority game  @xcite , a player gets a point when her choice is minor among players .",
    "thus , even if a choice happened to be successful at previous rounds , it is hard to remain minor with that choice as more and more players will also select it .",
    "although it is not possible for all the players to win together , the average probability of winning can become enhanced if they behave in proper ways .",
    "recently , an extreme version of the minority game was proposed as a special case of the reverse auction , which is called the _ lowest unique positive integer _ ( lupi ) game  @xcite .",
    "this game has @xmath0 players , and each of them may choose one integer from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "a player wins a point by choosing the lowest unique number .",
    "that means , simply choosing the number @xmath1 is not a good strategy since it is very likely to be chosen by other players , too . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this lupi game was analyzed in terms of the nash equilibrium ( ne ) : let us imagine that every player participates in a game with her own strategy , which is publicly known to the other players .",
    "if no player can improve her payoff by changing her strategy alone , the set of the players strategies is called a ne .",
    "even though this is an adequate framework to analyze a game , the actual enumeration of combinatorial possibilities becomes hard to manage as the number of players increases .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite tried to find an expression for general @xmath2 , many of the possible cases were missing in the probability calculations , even for @xmath3 . according to the suggested formula in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the loosing bids should be above the winning number or all should be below the winning number . furthermore , if they are below the winning number , they should all be on the same number .",
    "however , there exist many more cases that would generate the same winning number",
    ". we henceforth present a way to take all the possibilities into account correctly for general @xmath2 and analyze the results thereby obtained .",
    "suppose that each player draws numbers from her own probability distribution , which we will denote as her strategy . as explained above , we will find a ne in this strategy space . among several different ne s in the lupi game",
    ", we will be concerned with one that can be prevalent among these @xmath2 players , as studied in ref .",
    "this approach actually corresponds to the stability concept in the evolutionary game theory  @xcite .",
    "let us imagine that @xmath4 people are using a certain strategy , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 means the probability to choose number @xmath7 .",
    "the idea is to choose @xmath8 so that the chance of winning for the @xmath2th player becomes independent of her strategy .",
    "we consider all the possible cases that those @xmath4 people can make .",
    "these can be symbolically represented by @xmath9 from which all the combinations can be obtained as separate terms .",
    "for example , in a three - players game we get @xmath10 , where the first three terms on the right - hand side mean that players 1 and 2 chose the same number 1 , 2 or 3 , respectively .",
    "the other three terms correspond to the cases when players 1 or 2 have chosen two different numbers .",
    "together , these terms represent all the possible outcomes of the game ( as seen from the third player ) since they add up to the probability 1 due to the normalization condition @xmath11 .",
    "now , starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : total ] ) , we extract all the cases where there is a winner , among the @xmath4 players , at number 1 . these are characterized by all the terms which contain only one @xmath12 . in other words , if we write eq .",
    "( [ eq : total ] ) as a polynomial in @xmath12 : @xmath13 those cases are expressed by the second term and one can easily find it by @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , we find the cases with no winner at number 1 as @xmath15 if we are further to exclude the cases where there is a winner at number 2 , we apply the same operation on @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 generalizing this idea , we can find cases where there is no winner up to an arbitrary number @xmath7 by the following recursion relation : @xmath18 formally , we may define @xmath19 as the _ linearity projection operator _ with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote a generic polynomial of @xmath20 as @xmath21 , which may have an index to indicate more than one polynomial .",
    "the operator @xmath19 can be algebraically represented as @xmath22 = p_i e_i \\cdot d_i [ q]$ ] , where @xmath23 is elimination of @xmath6 by substituting zero and @xmath24 is differentiation with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 and @xmath26 mean some coefficients independent of @xmath6 .",
    "we then have the following relations for these operators :    * @xmath27 = a p_i \\delta_{1,n}$ ] * @xmath28 = l_i [ q]$ ] * @xmath29 = l_j \\cdot l_i [ q]$ ] * @xmath30 = a l_i[q_1 ] + b l_i[q_2]$ ] * @xmath31 = l_i \\cdot e_j [ q]$ ] * @xmath32 = 0 $ ] ,  if @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the kronecker delta .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{eq : op}\\ ] ] let us now calculate the probability for the @xmath2th player to win the lupi game by choosing number @xmath7 .",
    "then within the other @xmath4 people , there should be no winner up to @xmath36 and no one should choose the number @xmath7 .",
    "the last condition can be easily imposed by the same trick .",
    "that is , we simply substitute zero for @xmath6 to exclude every case where @xmath6 appears .",
    "therefore , the probability of our concern is simply written as @xmath37 = \\left\\ { \\prod_{j=1}^{i-1 } \\left(1-l_j \\right ) \\right\\ } \\cdot e_i [ z_0 ] $ ] and the @xmath2th player s expected payoff is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath2th player s strategy .    for example",
    ", @xmath40 from the normalization condition , @xmath41 , indeed we have only @xmath4 degrees of freedom in choosing @xmath8 so that @xmath42 the ne solution , @xmath43 , should satisfy @xmath44 constant for every @xmath7 so that @xmath45 can not be better by changing @xmath46 . that is , the chance of winning is the same on all numbers . for @xmath47 ,",
    "all the above calculation coincides with that presented in ref .",
    "note that we have @xmath4 degrees of freedom and @xmath4 equations so we can solve these simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ fig : ne](a ) shows solutions for some @xmath2 values , obtained by using the newton method . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ne](b ) , we plot its scaled version , considering that the horizontal axis naturally scales with @xmath2 , and the vertical axis roughly with @xmath48 .    setting @xmath49 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) , we find @xmath50 since the right - hand side should be positive , we can conclude that @xmath51 for every finite @xmath2 , which means the equilibrium solution can not be uniform .",
    "its implication is remarkable : let us imagine that everyone employs the same strategy @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , @xmath52 .",
    "the question is what the strategy @xmath8 should be in order to maximize the expected payoff , @xmath53 .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 , we find @xmath54 which is maximized at a uniform solution , @xmath55 .",
    "this is clearly different from the ne solution , @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the expression is not so simple for @xmath57 , but solving @xmath58 under @xmath59 , we still see that the uniform solution gives the best outcome to the population on average . although we confirmed this only for @xmath60 , this result is plausible since the risk of overlapping choices will be minimized by the uniform solution . on the other hand",
    ", we already know that the equilibrium strategy can not be uniform . indeed , if all the people follow @xmath61 , a player s chance of winning rapidly decays with her chosen number @xmath7 [ fig .  [ fig : bd](a ) ] .",
    "for example , one may use the formulation above to obtain @xmath62 for large @xmath2 , which coincide with the multinomial analysis in ref .",
    "therefore , each player is motivated to deviate from this uniform solution by choosing low numbers more frequently . in short",
    ", there exists a dilemma between the _ best _ and the _ equilibrium _ strategy .",
    "note that since each play only has one winner , the theoretical upper limit for the gain per play is @xmath48 .",
    "let us then compare these three cases : the equilibrium outcome , the best possible outcome , and the theoretical upper limit [ fig  [ fig : bd](b ) ] . while the uniform solution quickly converges to the theoretical maximum ,",
    "the ne solution remains suboptimal in this plot . for comparison , we also plot outcomes from the strategies in previous works : ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a strategy with @xmath63 which gives @xmath64 , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the solution is approximately written as @xmath65 for @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "note that the latter one actually performs better than presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we have taken all the possibilities into consideration . in any case , these become smaller than the outcome from our ne solution .    as eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) indicates , the number of terms to consider increases exponentially as @xmath2 grows , making the exact enumeration of probabilities intractable .",
    "although our current computational resources allow us to arrive only up to @xmath68 , our procedure provides a systematic way to take all the combinatorial cases into account for any @xmath2 , in principle .",
    "we believe that the behaviors shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bd ] give a clue to anticipate @xmath43 in the limit of large @xmath2 . specifically",
    ", we sketch a way to perform this task : the ne solution is obtained when @xmath69 for all @xmath7 and @xmath70 .",
    "this means that we can set @xmath71 to a certain constant @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the point is that @xmath71 has only one more variable , @xmath6 , than @xmath74 , so that we can attack each variable @xmath6 one by one .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq : c1 ] ) with @xmath75 gives @xmath76 . substituting this value into eq .",
    "( [ eq : c2 ] ) and with @xmath77 gives a value for @xmath78 , and so on .",
    "if the correct ne - value is chosen so that @xmath79 then the equilibrium solution , @xmath43 is obtained . when there exist several real solutions for @xmath6 then the correct root can be found using the restriction @xmath80 and the normalization condition @xmath81 .",
    "the procedure for a three - players ( @xmath47 ) game , where we have @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bd]b ) , goes as follows :    @xmath83 \\rightarrow p_2 \\approx 0.2684.\\nonumber\\\\ & c_3 & = c_0 = ( 1-p_3)^2 - 2p_1(1-p_1-p_3 ) - 2p_2(1-p_2-p_3 ) + 2p_1p_2\\nonumber\\\\ & \\rightarrow & [ \\textrm{inserting } p_1 \\textrm { and } p_2 ] \\rightarrow p_3",
    "\\approx 0.2673 \\pm 0.0246i.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the fact that the last solution is complex indicates that the value of @xmath72 is not exactly correct . adding more digits decreases the imaginary part while the real part moves closer to the correct solution ( e.g.",
    ",  @xmath84 gives @xmath85 ) .",
    "since there is no general formula for roots of polynomials of degree larger than four , it seems that this procedure should be carried out numerically .",
    "figure 3 shows the behavior of @xmath71 for @xmath86 to @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the solution of @xmath6 is obtained in each step by finding the crossing point @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 has been inserted into @xmath71 ) .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    to sum up , the benefit of this procedure is that if we know the correct ne - value , @xmath79 , then we can calculate the probabilities one by one up to any @xmath7 we want or are capable of doing within our computational resources , for any @xmath2 . in many situations it might ,",
    "for example , be enough to know the solution up to certain @xmath7 above which @xmath6 s are negligible .",
    "the method of solving for all @xmath7 simultaneously instead results in an _ all - or - nothing _ situation .",
    "of course , the down side is that we need to know @xmath91 in advance .",
    "however , recalling that @xmath92 , we see the limiting behavior @xmath93 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd](b ) .",
    "putting such a @xmath79 into this procedure may thus yield @xmath43 for large @xmath2 .",
    "the solution obtained in this way up to @xmath94 for @xmath88 and @xmath95 ( see fig .  3 ) is @xmath96 .",
    "this can be compared to the result obtained from solving for all @xmath7 simultaneously , which is @xmath97 .",
    "this method could also be used to find the actual ne solution , without knowing @xmath91 , by iterating the procedure until a self - consistent solution is found for all @xmath7 .",
    "if this is again beyond our computational power , one could at least determine an interval in which @xmath79 lies .",
    "let s say that we use expressions for @xmath71 up to @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath72 is too small then the normalization gets violated by @xmath99 . if @xmath72 is too large then the crossing points result in probabilities that are too small to add up to one in total , as long as @xmath6 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the largest possible sum of all @xmath2 probabilities is obtained if @xmath6 is uniform for @xmath100 , so the sum @xmath101 must be larger or equal to one .",
    "the interval obtained for @xmath88 and @xmath102 is marked by the two horizontal , dotted lines in fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "this interval becomes narrower as higher values of @xmath7 are addressed .",
    "note that when @xmath72 is changed all the curves @xmath71 for @xmath105 also change since we get new @xmath106 s with @xmath107 to be inserted into @xmath71 .",
    "we have shown a way of taking all the combinatorial possibilities into account for the lupi ( lowest unique positive integer ) game and proposed a procedure to find a nash equilibrium for a general number of players , @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out , however , that the number of terms to consider grows exponentially in @xmath2 , and that the computational capability of our personal computer can only solve the problem up to @xmath68 players . to deal with this problem",
    "we also suggest an alternative way of solving for the equilibrium strategy for each value of @xmath7 at a time , by inserting an estimate of the average expected payoff of each player .",
    "this procedure allows the problem to be solved sequentially instead of solving the whole problem simultaneously .",
    "we also have found that a uniform solution distributes nearly optimal outcomes equally among all the players .",
    "however , this would be driven to a suboptimal equilibrium solution , so we may regard this @xmath2-person game as an example of a social dilemma to manifest a conflict between group and individual interests .",
