    "the motivation for this paper is to solve exactly an eigenvalue problem that arises in @xcite and show that the exact scattering phase we obtain matches the string theory calculation .",
    "this provides further confirmation of the duality between the nonsinglet sectors of the @xmath1 matrix model and time dependent long string configurations in @xmath0 string theory .",
    "the problem is    @xmath2    which can also be written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 .",
    "it arises in general when one tries to compute the meson ( i.e. adjoint sector ) spectrum of the @xmath1 matrix model @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the singlet sector , which for a general potential reduces to @xmath5 independent fermions , the non - singlet sector hamiltonian includes interactions between the different eigenvalues .",
    "this interaction piece can be treated perturbatively in @xmath6 @xcite , and when , as in @xcite , one is interested in the double scaling limit around an inverted harmonic oscillator potential , the problem reduces to ( [ eq : first ] ) .",
    "we obtain the exact eigenstate of the above problem for any @xmath7 by summing up a perturbation series .",
    "the answer we get looks very simple , and there may be another , easier way of obtaining it .",
    "we set up the problem following the notation of @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : first ] ) can be written in fourier space as :    @xmath8    to start we take @xmath9 . in @xmath10 space this corresponds to a wave with very negative energy bouncing off an essentially linear potential . in @xmath11 space",
    "the picture is a wave with very positive energy which barrels through the potential very fast , so that its kinetic term is essentially linear , i.e. having a relativistic dispersion :    @xmath12    the solution is    @xmath13    @xmath14    for large @xmath10 we can fourier transform back and obtain ( up to overall phase ) in front of the @xmath15 , and also it is not taken into account that because of the @xmath16 in front of the term quadratic in @xmath11 in ( b.6 ) the determinants arising from the gaussian integrals have a relative factor of @xmath17 . ]",
    "@xmath18    moving away from the strict limit @xmath9 we will have a scattering phase    @xmath19    the idea is now to compute the phase @xmath20 by expanding the wave - function in powers of @xmath21 . in @xcite",
    "the first correction is computed and at that order matches the conjectured exact result    @xmath22    the perturbed wave - function that is obtained there has a singularity at @xmath23 .",
    "this presumably reflects the fact that in @xmath10 space the wave - function is unstable to tunneling under the barrier .",
    "when we sum up all the corrections the singularities will turn out to add up to a branch cut , and when we anti - symmetrize properly the branch cut will disappear .",
    "we will then explicitly verify the solution .",
    "for now , we write the purported solution : @xmath24and plug it in .",
    "we could have a priori made the expansion a prefactor multiplying the exponential , but a little experimentation shows that it is easiest to do the expansion inside the exponent . as in @xcite",
    "we obtain for the first correction :    @xmath25    @xmath26    continuing and computing @xmath27 leads us to conjecture that the general correction will take the form    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unknown coefficients . plugging into ( [ eq : eigen ] ) we obtain recursion relations that determine all the @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the goal in the next subsection is to solve these .",
    "first , it will be useful to note that    @xmath31_k^{k-2i}\\\\ = \\left(-{2 a_n \\over n } \\right ) { 1 \\over ( e^{\\pi k } - e^{-\\pi k})^{2n}}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and thus    @xmath32    to keep expressions manageable , we define generating functions that encode the information in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 :    @xmath33    we see that the combination @xmath34 appears a lot , so henceforth we set    @xmath35    we will suppress the argument @xmath11 when no ambiguity can arise . to avoid messy equations ,",
    "let us label by @xmath36 the derivative with respect to @xmath11 of the exponent in ( [ eq : purport ] ) :    @xmath37    for conciseness we have omitted the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath7 in the notation .",
    "now , by expanding the @xmath38 in ( [ eq : eigen ] ) and using ( [ eq : diff ] ) we obtain the following    @xmath39\\\\ = -a(k ) + { 2 \\over 1 - x e^{-2f(x ) } } a(k ) + { 2 x e^{-2f(x ) } \\over ( 1 - x e^{-2f(x)})^2 } \\left({2i \\over \\tanh \\pi k } - { 4i \\over \\tanh \\pi k } x f'(x ) \\right ) .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq : long}\\ ] ]    we also note that    @xmath40    so that ( [ eq : long ] ) becomes    @xmath41\\\\ + { 4ixe^{-2f } \\over \\left(1-xe^{-2f}\\right)^2 } { 1 \\over \\tanh \\pi k } \\left(1 - 2xf ' \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : diffeq } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    let us solve this equation .",
    "first off , the terms proportional to @xmath42 must be equal , so that    @xmath43    which can be reduced to the form    @xmath44    this is solved by    @xmath45    setting the remainder of the terms in ( [ eq : diffeq ] ) equal to each other we get    @xmath46      now that we ve solved for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 we plug in to get the final form of the solution . integrating by parts we first obtain    @xmath47    summing ,    @xmath48    after some easy algebraic manipulation of the terms above that involve @xmath49 , we get that the total exponent in ( [ eq : purport ] ) is    @xmath50    so the purported solution is    @xmath51    substituting in @xmath52 for @xmath53 , we obtain    @xmath54    .",
    "there are some problems with the above solution .",
    "for one , the square root will have a branch cut , and we will have to decide where it goes .",
    "the most naive choice of the branch cut ( which avoids the real @xmath11 axis altogether ) makes the exponent in ( [ eq : soln ] ) an even function of @xmath11 , and makes the solution odd in @xmath11 .",
    "this means that for both large positive @xmath11 and large negative @xmath11 the wavefunction is outgoing ( or incoming , depending on conventions ) , and that we have two purported independent solutions ( for the two signs of the square root ) .",
    "there is no local conservation so this might not be a problem , though by building wavepackets one might run into problems with unitarity ( have two packets that collide and disappear ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this choice of branch cut makes the exponent in the perturbed solution ( [ eq : soln ] ) not converge to that of the unperturbed solution ( [ eq : pert ] ) as @xmath7 goes to minus infinity . instead , from the standpoint of the perturbation expansion it is more natural to choose the branch cut to bisect the real @xmath11 axis at @xmath23 .",
    "also , when computing the first perturbative correction to the phase shift , @xcite integrates around the singularity at @xmath23 ; as successive more singular terms in the expansion pile up at @xmath23 , they fatten up into a branch cut that bisects the real @xmath11 axis at @xmath23 . with this choice of branch cut ,",
    "the function one obtains is not smooth at @xmath23 , and is not odd in @xmath11 .",
    "however , after anti - symmetrization , it becomes odd and smooth at @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , it becomes analytic on the entire complex @xmath11 plane , a fact which we will need in verifying that it indeed satisfies ( [ eq : eigen ] ) .    before we prove these things ,",
    "let us summarize .",
    "we choose the branch cut in the wavefunction to go through @xmath23 , in order to have a solution that approaches the unperturbed solution when @xmath7 goes to minus infinity . after anti - symmetrization",
    "we will show that we obtain an analytic wavefunction . by plugging in ,",
    "we independently verify in the next section that it does satisfy ( [ eq : eigen ] ) .",
    "it is the only combination of the two branches that can be verified to satisfy ( [ eq : eigen ] ) using the method in the next section .",
    "so even though there are other branches that give different wavefunctions that are smooth for real @xmath11 ( such as the ones discussed in the first paragraph of this section ) , they can not be verified using the methods of the next section .",
    "we believe that these other branches in fact do not satisfy ( [ eq : eigen ] ) , though we do not prove this uniqueness statement .",
    "let us now proceed systematically .",
    "first , the integrand in the exponent of ( [ eq : soln ] ) has branch points whenever @xmath55 and defines a riemann surface which is a double cover of the complex @xmath11-plane .",
    "what is not so obvious , but nevertheless true , is that the whole solution ( [ eq : soln ] ) is a well defined function on this riemann surface .",
    "let us see why this is so .",
    "first , we need a branch cut structure for @xmath56 - for definiteness , take the one discussed above ( the one that goes through @xmath23 ) . to continue",
    ", it will be useful to relate @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "we have    @xmath59    for definiteness take @xmath11 real and positive .",
    "the integral in the exponent is    @xmath60    the first term is easily evaluated to be @xmath61 .",
    "the second one is trickier . letting @xmath62 and @xmath63 we see that it is equal to    @xmath64    = 5.5 cm    with the branch cut of @xmath65 going from @xmath66 to @xmath17 we can take that of the logarithm to run along the positive @xmath67 axis and deform the integration contour away to infinity as shown in figure [ w1 ] .",
    "the two horizontal segments do not quite cancel because of the discontinuity in the logarithm , but together they yield an easily calculable contribution .",
    "likewise , the contribution from large @xmath67 also does not vanish , but is easily calculable .",
    "the integral , in the limit of @xmath68 going to infinity , is then    @xmath69 = \\\\ 2 \\pi i + 2 \\pi \\eh + 2 \\log \\left ( { \\sinh \\pi k \\over e^{\\pi \\eh } } + \\sqrt{1+{\\sinh^2 \\pi k \\over e^{2 \\pi \\eh } } } \\right ) \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and so    @xmath70    as one can straightforwardly verify , this equation relating @xmath71 to its translates by @xmath72 is the essential ingredient showing that ( [ eq : soln ] ) has the same branching structure as @xmath73 and so is well defined on the same riemann surface .",
    "now it turns out that the function of @xmath11 obtained by summing ( [ eq : soln ] ) over the two preimages of each @xmath11 in the riemann surface is precisely the the antisymmetrization discussed at the beginning of this section . specifically , the function in question is    @xmath74    with @xmath75where @xmath76 .    from its construction as a sum over preimages we immediately see that @xmath77 is analytic everywhere ( the endpoints of the cuts are the only places where one must take a little care ) .",
    "the fact that it solves ( [ eq : eigen ] ) will be checked presently .",
    "we explicitly verify that @xmath77 is a solution .",
    "we multiply ( [ eq : eigen ] ) through by @xmath78 to obtain    @xmath79    now , the operator @xmath80 is just translation by @xmath81 when it acts on @xmath77 .",
    "when it acts on @xmath82 it is not well defined because the branch cuts make the expansion in derivatives fail to converge .",
    "nevertheless , we will prove the above equation is true for @xmath82 , where we will interpret @xmath80 to mean translation by @xmath81 .",
    "this will show that the above is true for @xmath77 , because in that case @xmath80 is both well defined and translation by @xmath81 .",
    "let s take @xmath83 for definiteness .",
    "recall that @xmath84 .",
    "we have    @xmath85    recall also ( [ eq : f(k ) ] ) that @xmath86 acting on @xmath83 multiplies it by    @xmath87    given these two facts , we compute that the right and left hand sides of ( [ eq : tocheck ] ) ( with @xmath77 replaced by @xmath83 ) are , respectively ,    @xmath88    and    @xmath89    inserting the expression for @xmath90 and using elementary algebra shows that these are indeed equal .",
    "first , we examine the large @xmath11 behavior of the exponent of , say , @xmath91 . we denote it by @xmath92 :    @xmath93    where as before @xmath94 .",
    "this integral can not be done in closed form , but by differentiating with respect to @xmath7 under the integral sign one does obtain one that can be done through simple integration by parts .",
    "the result is    @xmath95_{k_0 \\left(\\eh \\right)}^k.\\ ] ]    this can be evaluated quite easily if one notices that it is simply half of the integral from @xmath96 to @xmath11 , with the branch cut chosen to go from @xmath97 to @xmath98 and the contour deformed above it .",
    "thus    @xmath99    taking the limit of @xmath11 going to infinity we see that @xmath92 approaches @xmath100 , which is starting to look like the conjectured phase shift ( [ eq : phase ] ) .",
    "let us now figure out some asymptotics .",
    "we spare the reader the easy integrals and state only that in the limit @xmath9 we have    @xmath101    and in the limit @xmath102    @xmath103    because we know the derivative of @xmath104 with respect to @xmath7 , we can figure out the phase shift for any energy @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain that for large @xmath11 ,    @xmath105\\ ] ]    this matches ( [ eq : phase ] ) .",
