    "understanding the motion of charge carriers in magnetic backgrounds is a problem that appears in a variety of materials under a variety of circumstances .",
    "the magnetic order can be due to local or to itinerant moments ; their magnetic order may be intrinsic or may be mediated by the charge carriers ; the charge carriers may occupy the same or different bands from those giving rise to the magnetic background ; at sufficiently low temperatures the background may order ferromagnetically ( fm ) , antiferromagnetically ( afm ) , in more complicated patterns , or be frustrated ; and so on and so forth .",
    "one limit that has received a lot of attention is that of a single carrier evolving in a magnetic background of local moments that have long - range magnetic order in the absence of the carrier .",
    "if the carrier is injected into the band that hosts the local moments , its injection creates a hole in the magnetic background .",
    "hopping of the hole changes the magnetic background as it corresponds to hopping in the opposite direction of a lattice spin .",
    "this situation is described by the so - called @xmath1 model which was first introduced by anderson @xcite and then proposed as an effective model for cuprates by zhang and rice @xcite . due to the possible connection to cuprates",
    ", such models have received a lot of attention .",
    "this article , however , deals with a different case , where the carrier and the magnetic moments are hosted by different bands .",
    "such a situation occurs , for instance , in fm semiconductors such as euo and eus and is described by the @xmath2 model @xcite . in these materials",
    "the carrier is hosted in a wide @xmath3-band , whereas the local moments are hosted by a partially filled , strongly localized @xmath4-band . here",
    "motion of the carrier does not necessarily modify the configuration of the magnetic background .    for these latter models ,",
    "if the lattice spins have fm order at @xmath5 , an exact solution for the carrier s propagator exists .",
    "this is because the @xmath6-component of the total spin ( carrier plus local moments ) is conserved so the number of magnons that can be excited by the carrier is at most one ( we assume that all spins are @xmath7 ) . starting from the fm state either no spin flip is possible ( if the carrier has spin parallel to the background ) , or at most one magnon can be created ( if the carrier has spin antiparallel to the background ) .",
    "the first case is trivial , and the second is simple enough to be solved analytically .",
    "the solution was first discussed in ref . and then generalized to more complex lattices .",
    "@xcite analyses of the eigenstates and eigenenergies are also available.@xcite    for an afm background , on the other hand , an analytic solution is not known even at @xmath5 because the excitation of arbitrarily many magnons is now possible as the carrier can exchange the spins of any background pair with a spin - up and a spin - down .",
    "combined with the generally very nontrivial nature of the afm background wavefunction , this complicates matters exceedingly .    when trying to extend the fm solution to finite-@xmath0 , one runs into somewhat similar problems because the carrier is now injected into a magnetic background which has a population of thermal magnons already present .",
    "approximations for this case have been proposed ( i ) for medium to high-@xmath0 , based on calculating moments of the green s function ( gf ) and fitting to limiting cases where the exact solution is known . the temperature enters via the magnetization @xmath8 , which is assumed to be known and not to be affected by the carrier ; @xcite ( ii ) for weak and strong interactions between the carrier and the local moments , as well as fully fm ordered background and paramagnetic background , kubo used the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) to calculate the total density of states ( dos).@xcite cpa is a self - consistent approximation that assumes that the carrier propagates in an effective medium .",
    "furthermore , kubo uses the molecular field approximation for the interaction between local moments , thereby ignoring correlations ; ( iii ) for very low-@xmath0 , an approximation for the self - energy was obtained by us by limiting the states that enter the thermal average to one - magnon states.@xcite it shows unphysical features at higher temperatures where higher energy states become relevant .",
    "none of these approaches includes fully the effects of the local environment on the carrier . in this article",
    "we try to answer the question of what role , if any , is played by the local environment .",
    "is there a class of configurations that contributes more than others ?",
    "how does an afm ordered environment compare to a fm ordered one , and are there any similarities between the two ?",
    "answering such questions is crucial for the development of a better understanding ( and hopefully better approximations ) for the finite-@xmath0 spectral weight of the carrier .",
    "our approach is to study a simplified model which allows us to obtain the first ( to the best of our knowledge ) finite-@xmath0 exact numerical results in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these teach us valuable lessons about the physics of this simpler problem ; some of these are relevant for more complex models , too .",
    "the simplification consists in neglecting all spin - flip processes , i.e. assuming that all interactions between the lattice spins , and between them and the carrier , are ising - like . while the @xmath5 behavior of this model is trivial , we find that it produces rich physics at finite-@xmath0 , which needs to be understood before considering the additional complications introduced by allowing spin - flip processes .",
    "apart from making an exact solution possible , this simple model also allows us to consider both fm and afm backgrounds on equal footing , which is not possible in general .",
    "interestingly , we find considerable similarities between the results for the two cases , which we are able to explain as being due to similarities between the local background configurations that control the ( at least low and medium-@xmath0 ) carrier dynamics .",
    "we then use these insights to construct an analytical approximation which accurately reproduces the features of the exact solution in the range of low to medium temperatures .    by ignoring spin - flip processes",
    ", we create a situation that is in some ways similar to that of disorder binary alloys of the type a@xmath9b@xmath10 .",
    "a carrier in the conduction band of such an alloy experiences a different on - site energy if it sits on an a or a b site . in our model",
    "the on - site carrier energy is @xmath11 , depending on whether the local spin at that site points up or down .",
    "thus , any configurations of the alloy can be exactly mapped into a spin configuration of the magnetic background .",
    "these binary alloys have been extensively studied .",
    "an exact numerical solution can be obtained for the disorder - averaged gfs , as pointed out by schmidt@xcite and dyson.@xcite it was used for numerical studies of the phonon dos @xcite and the dos of carriers in the conduction band.@xcite many approximations have been proposed , the most well - known and used being the cpa.@xcite diagrammatic expansions of the self - energy have been developed by several authors , see for instance refs . , but were shown to result in non - analytic behavior and thus unphysical gfs.@xcite later this problem was resolved by a careful consideration of which diagrams to sum.@xcite    this knowledge can not be directly used in our problem , despite the similarities between the models , because for binary alloys one performs a disorder average whereas we do a thermal average .",
    "the disorder average keeps the concentration @xmath12 fixed ; all configurations consistent with it are equally likely ( one generally ignores correlations in the disorder ) , all the others are forbidden .",
    "in contrast , a thermal average includes all possible configurations but with a boltzmann factor that controls the extent of spin - spin correlations .",
    "these correlations are key , as no magnetic order can exist in their absence .",
    "the problems also have different symmetry properties .",
    "our problem is truly translationally invariant , whereas for binary alloys translational invariance is only restored by averaging over all possible disorder configurations .",
    "for example , while all eigenstates are localized in a 1d disordered alloy model , the eigenstates of our model remain extended at any @xmath0 . despite these differences",
    ", there are similarities between the resulting spectral weights which help us understand our results , as discussed below .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the model and section iii describes the method by which we calculate the gf .",
    "results are discussed in section iv for a 1d chain , although the method can be trivially extended to higher dimension .",
    "we also present here the analytic approximation we propose for low and medium temperatures .",
    "the concluding remarks are in section v.",
    "consider a single spin-@xmath7 charge carrier which interacts with a chain of ising spins , also of magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "note that the exact method that we use can be generalized straightforwardly to higher dimensions .",
    "the advantage of 1d chains ( apart from speed of computations ) is that a host of analytic results are available for the undoped case .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves here to ising chains with periodic boundary conditions after @xmath13 sites .",
    "the @xmath14 site is located at @xmath15 , and we set @xmath16 .    the exchange between lattice spins is ising - like : @xmath17 and is fm ( @xmath18 ) or afm ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the second term describes the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "the spin operator at site @xmath21 is @xmath22 , with the prefactors absorbed into the coupling constants .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath23 of eigenvalues @xmath24 of each spin , and @xmath25 is the eigenenergy .",
    "the kinetic energy of the carrier is described by a tight - binding model @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the creation operator of a spin-@xmath28 carrier at site @xmath21 .",
    "the creation operator in momentum - space is @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the exchange between the carrier and the lattice spins is also of ising type : @xmath31 where again a factor @xmath32 is absorbed into @xmath33 .",
    "since no spin - flips are allowed in this model , from now on we assume without loss of generality that the carrier has spin - up , @xmath34 , and not write it explicitly .",
    "we also set @xmath35 .",
    "results for a spin - down carrier are obtained from these by switching @xmath36 .    for the undoped ising chain ,",
    "an exact solution at finite-@xmath0 is possible and reviewed in the appendix .",
    "note that a 1d chain has long - range magnetic order only at @xmath5 .",
    "we can , however , mimic a finite-@xmath0 ordered state by turning on the magnetic field @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to a finite correlation independent of the distance between spins .",
    "we want to calculate the finite-@xmath0 retarded single - particle gf , which in the time - domain is defined as : @xmath37 where the operator @xmath38 is in the heisenberg picture .",
    "furthermore @xmath39 is the thermal average and @xmath40 . from now on we set @xmath41 .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that the temperature dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gftime ] ) is solely controlled by @xmath42 : we inject the carrier into the otherwise undoped ising chain , which at a given @xmath0 is described by a density matrix @xmath43 . in other words , this formulation is for a canonical ensemble with a conserved carrier number , not the usual grand - canonical formulation .",
    "it is convenient to work in the frequency - domain .",
    "we fourier transform @xmath44  which yields : @xmath45 where @xmath46  is the resolvent of @xmath47 .",
    "the small , real quantity @xmath48 ensures retardation and sets a finite carrier lifetime @xmath49 . note that the argument of the resolvent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfomega ] ) is shifted by @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the energy is measured from that of the ising chain at the time of injection .",
    "this becomes clear when using a lehmann representation by projecting on the one - carrier eigenstates @xmath51 : @xmath52 @xmath53 has poles at energies @xmath54 that measure the change in total energy due to the carrier s injection .",
    "the weights correspond to the overlap between the true eigenstates @xmath55 and the free - carrier states @xmath56 .    for any configuration @xmath57",
    ", the contribution to the thermal average can be evaluated using continued fractions.@xcite first , we need to shift to the real - space representation . making use of the translational invariance",
    "we then obtain @xmath58 where we define : @xmath59 physically @xmath60 is related to the probability that the carrier is injected at site @xmath61 and propagates to site @xmath8 . for any state @xmath57 ( except the fully ordered ones )",
    "the translational invariance is broken , @xmath62 .",
    "this symmetry is only restored by the ensemble average , which then leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gfrealspace ] ) .    to obtain the gf equations of motion ( eom ) we use dyson s identity @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the resolvent for @xmath66 . choosing @xmath67",
    ", we find : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "since the eom do not change the values of @xmath70 and @xmath57 , to shorten notation we do not write them explicitly in the following .",
    "the eom are solved with the ansatz @xcite @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 ( @xmath13 is assumed and implemented as explained below ) .",
    "then @xmath75 and similarly for @xmath76 .",
    "we now introduce a cutoff @xmath77 at which we truncate these relations by setting @xmath78 .",
    "the justification is provided by the finite lifetime @xmath49 of the carrier , which prevents it from propagating arbitrarily far from its injection site . as a result @xmath79 , which measures the amplitude of probability that the carrier propagates between sites @xmath61 and 0 , must vanish for sufficiently large @xmath80.@xcite    it is then straightforward to calculate all @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the configuration @xmath57  and a given @xmath70 , to find : @xmath83",

    "is known analytically , it can be used to verify the convergence .    we need to have @xmath86 , otherwise the carrier may travel between sites @xmath61 and 0 on both sides of the closed loop , which is at odds with the ansatz chosen above",
    ". this condition is automatically satisfied if @xmath87 . to take this limit , we note that @xmath79 only depend on the spins @xmath88 .",

    "the location of the various resonances does not change appreciably with @xmath123 .    to understand the physical origin of these resonances , consider the analogy with the binary alloy model , which also shows such `` peaky '' structures in its total density of states ( dos ) , marking the bound states of the carrier inside small clusters of like - atoms.@xcite as is well known , in the presence of any amount of on - site disorder all eigenstates of a 1d chain become localized . to find",
    "the dos one can formally calculate the disorder averaged green s function ( which regains invariance to translations ) but this quantity has no physical meaning .",
    "this is because in any real system there is a given disorder distribution , and if all eigenstates are localized then the carrier occupies forever the same small region of space and self - averaging does not occur . in other words , if the carrier is trapped in a cluster of atoms it will stay trapped indefinitely .    each configuration of the binary alloy can be mapped into a spin configuration of the ising chain , by replacing atoms a / b by spins up / down .",
    "small clusters of like - atoms then map into magnetic domains , and there are trapped states of the carrier inside them , as already shown .",
    "however , unlike the fixed disorder configuration , the spin configuration changes continuously through thermal fluctuations .",
    "a trapped carrier therefore has a finite lifetime linked to the persistence of that domain : eventually the local spin configuration changes and the carrier is released to move along the chain .",

    "we find that as @xmath20 increases , the initially large feature at the bottom of the lower band starts to disappear and most of its weight is moved to the bottom of the upper band .",

    "interesting , however , most of the resonances in the lower band remain almost unchanged .",
    "the reason is that while @xmath150 , the energy cost for a small domain is very low so their appearance is very likely .",
    "if @xmath151  the ising chain is forced into the @xmath113 ground state and only the higher @xmath5 peak survives ( not shown ) .    for afm coupling the effect of @xmath20",
    "is more dramatic , as it forces the system into the @xmath113 fm ground - state if @xmath152 becomes large enough .",
    "indeed , for large @xmath20 most of the weight is moved into the upper fm peak and most of the resonances disappear , except for the one at @xmath153 that is still quite large .",
    "its energy is very close to that of the first fm cluster listed in table [ tab : smallclusters ] , and indeed it seems plausible that this is due to a single flipped spin which entraps the carrier .",
    "this domain is disfavored by @xmath20 , but actually lowers the exchange energy with its neighbors .",
    "note that we used different field strengths for the fm and afm cases . in the latter case",
    "much higher fields are needed to produce long range correlations since there is a competition between the exchange energy of neighboring spins and the external field .",
    "a measure for this is the spin - spin correlation function @xmath154 , which for the parameters used in fig .",

    "all these one - domain states are weighed by the same boltzmann factor @xmath164 ( we take the energy of the fully ordered fm states as reference ) .    as discussed , a physically meaningful result has equal contributions from the spin - down and spin - up sectors .",

    "[ fig : fmdomains ] and [ fig : afmdomains ] , respectively , for various lengths @xmath170 of the largest domain included , at two temperatures . for comparison ,",
    "the monte carlo results are also shown ( shaded regions ) .",
    "the quality of the approximation varies substantially with @xmath170 .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fmdomains ] shows that for @xmath196 and @xmath198 , the weight of the resonances is underestimated and not all of them are reproduced by the approximation . for @xmath199 the agreement between the approximation and the exact results is very good , but it worsens again for @xmath200 .",
    "not only does the latter overestimate the weight of the resonances , but it also predicts negative spectral weight just below the bands . while this negative weight is needed to satisfy the sum rule , its presence is unphysical and signals a failure of the approximation .",
    "the same trends are observed for @xmath197 in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fmdomains ] . here",
    "the best agreement is obtained at @xmath201 , although resonances associated with longer domains are missing .",
    "they appear for @xmath202 , however so does the unphysical behavior . for even lower values of @xmath132",
    "the approximation fails completely to capture the correct weight of the resonances , although , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smallclustersfm ] , their locations are due to carrier trapping in domain walls .    the afm approximation yields very similar results . the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : afmdomains ] shows that again for @xmath203 excellent agreement with the exact solution is reached for @xmath199 , while for larger values of @xmath170 the weight of the resonances is overestimated and unphysical behavior occurs if @xmath204 . for @xmath205",
    "the agreement with the exact solution is best for @xmath206 and unphysical behavior already occurs at @xmath207 .",
    "again the approximation fails badly to capture the proper weight of various features , for smaller values of @xmath132 ( higher @xmath0 ) .",
    "naively , one may expect the approximation to improve when @xmath170 is increased since this means that a larger fraction of the possible configurations is considered . however , there are two factors which determine how a domain contributes to the thermal average .",
    "one is the additional energy cost of a domain , which is accounted for by the boltzmann factor and in 1d does not depend on the domain s length .",
    "the other is the increase in entropy with increasing number of domains . as the temperature increases",
    ", minimization of the free energy @xmath208 is increasingly driven by entropy maximization , resulting in more domains and thus shorter correlations .",
    "the order of magnitude for the maximal domain size should be given by the spin - spin correlation length @xmath209 ( defined in the appendix ) .",
    "indeed , we obtain @xmath210 and @xmath211 for @xmath212 and @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "this compares well with the values of @xmath170 where the approximation performs well , see figs .",
    "[ fig : fmdomains ] and [ fig : afmdomains ] .",
    "but for afm coupling @xmath213 . ]",
    "another way to see why the approximation with @xmath214 is bound to become wrong is to realize that all domain walls whose length is longer than the distance explored by the carrier within its lifetime are actually indistinguishable from the `` other '' ordered fm configuration , from the point of view of the carrier . in other words ,",
    "all these configurations essentially contribute a @xmath215 , and their inclusion gives the wrong weighting to the @xmath216 contribution .",
    "similarly , configurations with two long domain walls placed relatively close together will have states where the carrier is trapped in the short region between the domains , indistinguishable from having a short domain formed in the `` other '' ordered fm configuration .",
    "adding many such contributions will affect the weights of these one - domain contributions , etc .",
    "these arguments suggest that a better approximation is : @xmath217g_{\\uparrow}^{\\text{fm}}(k,\\omega)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath218 , where @xmath219 are adjusted to capture accurately the weight of resonances due to trapping into short domains . for low and medium temperatures we showed that @xmath220",
    "if @xmath221 , and zero otherwise , gives very decent predictions .",
    "clearly this can not work at high temperatures of order @xmath139 where @xmath222 .",
    "so far we have been unable to think of a reasonable form of @xmath223 in this regime , but the comparisons displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : smallclustersfm ] suggest that it should exist .",
    "to summarize , we obtained numerically exact spectral functions for a simplified model of a carrier injected into a 1d ising chain at finite-@xmath0 .",
    "the results highlight the importance of small domains that can trap the carrier , which were shown to be responsible for the resonances that appear as @xmath0 increases .",
    "a simple analytic approximation based on these ideas was found to perform well at low and medium temperatures . with further insights",
    ", it may be possible to generalize it to high temperatures , as well .",
    "interestingly , chains with both fm and afm coupling can be understood in similar terms , although generically one expects quite different phenomenology for a carrier injected into a fm vs afm background .    as highlighted throughout , there are parallels between this problem and that of a carrier moving in a random binary alloy , where the importance of small clusters of like - atoms , equivalent to the small domains of our model , is well documented.@xcite there are , however , also major differences : finite @xmath131 maps into correlations between the atoms of the alloy ( usually these are ignored ) .",
    "the thermal average is also very different , both qualitatively and quantitatively , from a disorder average .",
    "it is therefore not a priori clear how much of the considerable amount of work devoted to finding analytic approximations for binary alloys can be used for the magnetic problem .    in terms of generalizations ,",
    "one direction is to see how far these insights carry over to higher dimensions , where long - range magnetic order survives at finite @xmath0 . for binary alloys",
    "it is known that the fine - structure of the spectral function is most dominant in 1d.@xcite for our model , the energy cost scales with the domain size in 2d and 3d , unlike in 1d and unlike for a binary alloy .",
    "this may well lead to a behavior that is different from that of the binary alloys and could cause the fine - structure associated with very small domains to remain present in higher dimensions , at least at low temperatures .",
    "another interesting direction is to allow for heisenberg coupling between the carrier and the local moments ( still with ising coupling between the latter ) . in this case",
    "spin - flip processes become possible .",
    "the carrier can move small domains around ( in fact , the spin - polaron@xcite can be thought of as a mobile bound state between the carrier and a one - site domain ) , or split longer domains into several smaller ones , etc .",
    "understanding the consequences of such processes and their effect on the finite-@xmath0 spectral function would be very useful .",
    "even more complicated is the case with heisenberg coupling between the lattice spins .",
    "clearly there is a lot of work , both numerical and analytical , to be done before these problems are solved .",
    "our results underline the importance of the local environment for the behavior of a charge carrier in a magnetic background , at least for this model and in low dimension .",
    "incorporating these effects is difficult since mean - field approximations can not capture them .",
    "the only real alternative is to obtain an understanding of which states of the environment contribute most to the temperature average , and to propose approximations based on taking the average over this limited set of states .",
    "our work presents the first step in this process .",
    "here we review the exact solution of the undoped ising chain .",
    "all quantities of interest to us are obtained from the partition function : @xmath224 where the sum is over all configurations of lattice spins .",
    "the sum can be rewritten as : @xmath225 where the transfer matrix is @xmath226 , and its eigenvalues are : @xmath227.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bulk value of the magnetization @xmath228 is : @xmath229 the correlation between spins is given by @xmath230 where the correlation length is @xmath231 .",
