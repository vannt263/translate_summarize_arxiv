    "in recent years , there has been a surge of interest in social media platforms such as facebook and twitter , collaborative projects in the spirit of wikipedia , and services that rely on the social structure underlying these services , including link : www.cnn.com[cnn.com ] s `` popular on facebook '' and link : www.nytimes.com[nytimes.com ] s `` most emailed '' .",
    "as these platforms and services have been gaining momentum , efforts in the computational social sciences have begun studying patterns of behavior that result in organized social structure and interactions ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    ", we develop a new tool to analyze data about social structure and interactions routinely collected in this context .",
    "there is a rich literature of statistical models to analyze binary interactions or networks @xcite .",
    "however , while many interesting interaction data sets involve weighted measurements on pairs on individuals , arguably , only a few of the existing models are amenable to analyze the resulting weighted networks .",
    "we consider situations where we observe an undirected weighted network , encoded by a symmetric adjacency matrix with integer entries and diagonal elements equal to zero .",
    "our modeling approach is to decompose the graphon @xmath0 , which defines an exchangeable model @xcite for integer - valued measurements of pairs of individuals @xmath1 , in terms of a number of basis matrices that grows with the size of the network , @xmath2 the factorization of @xmath0 is related to models for binary networks based on the singular value decomposition and other factorizations @xcite .",
    "however , we abandon the popular orthogonality constraint @xcite among the basis matrices @xmath3s to attain interpretability in terms of multi - scale social structure , and we chose not model zero edge weights to enable the estimation to scale linearly with the number of positive weights @xcite",
    ". these choices often lead to a non - trivial inferential setting @xcite .",
    "related methods utilize a network to encode inferred dependence among multivariate data @xcite .",
    "we term our method `` graphlet decomposition '' , as it is reminiscent of a wavelet decomposition of a graph .",
    "an unrelated literature uses the term graphlets to denote network motifs @xcite .",
    "the key features of the graphlet decomposition we introduce in this paper are : the basis matrices @xmath3s are non - orthogonal , but capture overlapping communities at multiple scales ; the information used for inference comes exclusively from positive weights ; parameter estimation is linear in the number of positive weights , and avoids dealing with permutations of the input adjacency matrix @xmath4 by inferring the basis elements @xmath3 from data .",
    "the basic idea is to posit a poisson model for the edge weights @xmath1 and parametrize the rate matrix @xmath0 in terms of a binary factor matrix @xmath5 .",
    "the binary factors can be interpreted as latent features that induce social structure through homophily .",
    "the factor matrix @xmath5 allows for an equivalent interpretation as basis matrices , which define overlapping cliques of different sizes .",
    "inference is carried out in two stages : first we identify candidate basis matrices using bron - kerbosch , then we estimate coefficients using em . the computational complexity of the inference is addressed in section [ sec : complexity ] .",
    "consider observing an undirected weighted network , encoded by a symmetric adjacency matrix with integer entries and diagonal elements equal to zero . in the derivations below ,",
    "we avoid notation whose sole purpose is to set to zero diagonal elements of the resulting matrices .",
    "intuitively , we want to posit a data generating process that can explain edge weights in terms of social information , quantified by community structure at multiple scales and possibly overlapping .",
    "we choose to represent communities in terms of their constituent maximal cliques .",
    "[ def1 ] the graphlet decomposition ( gd ) of a matrix @xmath0 with non - negative entries @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is an @xmath8 binary matrix , @xmath9 is a @xmath10 diagonal matrix .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is set to zero and @xmath13 is positive for each @xmath14",
    ".    the basis matrix @xmath5 can be interpreted in terms overlapping communities at multiple scales . to see this ,",
    "denote the @xmath14-th column of the matrix @xmath5 as @xmath15 .",
    "we can re - write @xmath16 , where each @xmath3 is an @xmath17 matrix defined as @xmath18 , in which the diagonal is set to zero .",
    "we refer to @xmath3 as basis elements .",
    "think of the @xmath14-th column of @xmath5 as encoding a community of interest ; then the vector @xmath15 specifies which individuals are members of that community , and the basis element @xmath3 is the binary graph that specifies the connections among the member of that community .",
    "the same individual may participate to multiple communities , and the communities may span different scales .",
    "the model for an observed network @xmath4 is then @xmath19    this is essentially a binary factor model with a truncated poisson link and two important nuances .",
    "standard factor models assume that entire rows of the matrix @xmath4 are conditionally independent , even when the matrix is square and row and column @xmath14 refer to the same unit of analysis .",
    "in contrast , our model treats the individual random variables @xmath20 as exchangeable , and imposes the restriction that positives entries in the factors map ( in some way ) to maximal cliques in the observed network .",
    "in addition , the matrix @xmath4 is sparse ; our model implies that zero edge weights carry no information about maximal cliques , and thus are not relevant for estimation .",
    "these nuances  map between cliques and factors , and information from positives entries only  produce a new and interesting inferential setting that scales to large weighted networks .      computing the graphlet decomposition of a network @xmath4 involves the estimation of a few critical parameters : the number of basis elements @xmath21 , the basis matrix @xmath5 or equivalently the basis elements @xmath22 , and the coefficients associated with these basis elements @xmath23 .",
    "we develop a two - stage estimation algorithm .",
    "first , we identify a candidate set of @xmath24 basis elements , using the bron - kerbosch algorithm , and obtain a candidate basis matrix @xmath25 .",
    "second , we develop an expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm to estimate the corresponding coefficients @xmath26 ; several of these coefficients will vanish , thus selecting a final set of basis elements .",
    "we study theoretical properties of this estimation algorithm in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "figure [ figregraph ] illustrates the steps of the estimation process on a toy network .",
    "the algorithm to identify the candidate basis elements proceeds by thresholding the observed network @xmath4 at a number of levels , @xmath27 , and by identifying all the maximal cliques in the corresponding sequence of binary networks , @xmath28 , using the bron - kerbosch algorithm @xcite . the resulting cumulative collection of @xmath24 maximal cliques found in the sequence of networks @xmath29",

    "we show that , under certain conditions on the true underlying basis matrix @xmath5 , algorithm [ algo1 ] finds a set of candidate basis elements that contains the true set of basis elements .",
    "in addition , in section [ sec : complexity ] we show that , under the same conditions on @xmath5 and additional realistic assumptions , we expect to have a number of candidate basis elements of the same order of magnitude of the true number of basis elements , @xmath35 , as the network size @xmath36 grows , given that the maximum weight is stationary , @xmath37 .      given the candidate set of basis elements encoded in @xmath25 , we develop an em algorithm to estimate the corresponding coefficients @xmath26 . under certain conditions on the true basis matrix @xmath5",
    ", this algorithm consistently estimates the coefficients by zeroing out the coefficients associated with the unnecessary basis elements .",
    "recall that we have @xmath24 candidate basis elements @xmath38 .",
    "let s define a set of statistics @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and let s introduce a set of latent @xmath41 matrices @xmath42 with positive entries , subject to the only constrain that @xmath43 .",

    "the truncated poisson likelihood can also be maximized directly , using a kl divergence argument @xcite involving the discrete probability distribution obtained by normalizing the data matrix , @xmath48 , and a linear combination of discrete probability distributions obtained by normalizing the candidate basis matrices , @xmath49 .",
    "here we develop some theory for graphlets when the graph @xmath4 is generated by a non - expandable collection of basis matrices .",
    "the extent to which these results extend to the general case is unclear , as of this writing , however , the results help form some intuition about how graphlets encode information .",
    "see the appendix for details of the proofs .",
    "we begin by establishing some notation .",

    "[ def1 ] a collection of @xmath58 is non - expandable if for any expansion @xmath59 of @xmath60 we can find @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "a consequence of the above definition is that , if a set of basis is non - expandable , then any subset of it is also non - expandable .",
    "the first result asserts that the collection of poisson rates @xmath0 can be uniquely decomposed into a collection of basis matrices @xmath22 , here encoded by the equivalent binary matrix @xmath5 , with weights @xmath63 .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath0 be a symmetric @xmath41 nonnegative matrix which is generated by a non - expandable basis .",

    "this implies that , in the absence of noise , the set of parameters @xmath67 are estimable from the data @xmath4 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] is constructive by means of algorithm [ algo0 ] , which is fast but sensitive to noise . in practice ,",

    "the two theorems above may be used to generate random cliques , for instance , by requiring the entries of the matrix @xmath5 to be iid bernoulli random variables .      here",

    "in this case , we define redundancy as the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "theorem [ thm2 ] states that number of candidate basis elements is never smaller than the true number of basis @xmath21 .",
    "thus theorem [ thm4 ] leads to the following upper bound on redundancy @xmath77    in a realistic scenario we may have that @xmath78 , the complexity of the candidate basis set is @xmath79 , and the implied redundancy is at most @xmath80 . alternatively , if @xmath81 , the implied redundancy is at most @xmath82 .",
    "these are regimes we often encounter in practice .",
    "these limiting behaviors of @xmath71 arise whenever the nodes in a network can be assumed to have a capacity that is essentially independent of the size of the network , e.g. , individuals participate in the activities of a constant number of groups over time",
    ".    these calculations are only suggestive for networks generated by an expandable basis",
    ". however , non expandability tends to be a reasonable approximation in many situations , including whenever exchangeable graph models are good fit for the network .",

    "the graphlet decomposition of a weighted network is an exploratory tool , which is based on a simple but compelling statistical model , it is amenable to theoretical analysis , and it scales to large weighted networks .",
    "svd is the most parsimonious orthogonal decomposition of a data matrix @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "graphlets abandon the orthogonality constraint to attain interpretability of the basis matrix in terms of social information . in the presence of social structure ,",
    "graphlet is a better summary of the variability in the observed connectivity .",
    "svd always achieves a lower reconstruction error , however , when a few basis elements are considered ( see figure [ fig : bsdstructure1 ] ) suggesting that orthogonality induces a more useful set of constraints whenever a very low dimensional representation is of interest .",
    "graphlets provide a parsimonious sumary of complex social structure , in practice .",
    "the simulation studies in sections [ sec : results_estimation ] and [ sec : social_info ] suggest that graphlets are leveraging the social structure underlying messaging patterns on facebook to deliver the high compression / high accuracy ratios we empirically observe in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the information graphlets utilize for inference comes exclusively from positive weights in the network .",
    "this feature is the source of desirable properties , however , because of this , graphlets are also sensitive to missing data ; zero edge weights can not be imputed . more research is needed to address this issue properly , while maintaining the properties outlined in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "empirical solutions include considering powers of the original network , as in section [ reshis ] , or cumulating weights over a long observation window , as in section [ sec : fb ] .",
