    "the main goal of qcd is to describe the structure of hadrons in terms of its fundamental degrees of freedom given by the quarks and gluons , or partons .",
    "hadrons are observable in both the initial and final stages of a hard process while the existence and properties of partons are inferred only indirectly . because of the smallness of the running coupling constant of qcd at large enough momentum transfer squared , @xmath4 , or equivalently at short distances @xmath5 , a hard probe sees hadrons as composed of `` free '' quarks and gluons carrying fractions @xmath1 of the hadron s light cone ( lc ) momentum , with given probability distributions .",
    "factorization theorems regulate this fundamental property of the theory by allowing for the short distance behavior at a given scale , @xmath4 , to be evaluated separately from the long distance contribution which is identified with the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "@xcite . as increasingly shorter distances are probed the pdfs shape in @xmath1 changes due to radiative processes , according to a pattern which is calculable with high accuracy within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "although the perturbative phases of a hard collision are clearly distinct from the non - perturbative stage that gives rise to hadron structure , experimental observations indicate that such non - perturbative stage appears to be almost ubiquitously pre - determined by  or to be keeping track of  the perturbative mechanism .",
    "this concept goes under the name of _ parton - hadron duality_. parton - hadron duality implies in the most extreme case , that hadronic observables are replaced by calculable partonic ones with little more going into the hadronic formation phase of the process . in this respect ,",
    "duality can be seen as a phenomenological manifestation of the non - perturbative to perturbative transition in qcd .",
    "a full explanation for its onset is however still lacking .",
    "as an example in this contribution we will focus on bloom gilman ( bg ) duality @xcite , observed in dis . here the relevant kinematical variables are : @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the proton mass and @xmath8 the energy transfer in the lab system ) , the four - momentum transfer , @xmath4 , and the invariant mass for the proton , @xmath9 , and virtual photon , @xmath10 , system , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) . for large values of bjorken @xmath13 , and @xmath4 in the multi - gev region , one has @xmath14 gev@xmath15 , _ i.e. _ the cross section is dominated by resonance formation . while it is impossible to reconstruct the detailed structure of the proton s resonances ,",
    "these remarkably follow the pqcd predictions when averaged over @xmath1 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "although bg duality was observed at the inception of qcd , quantitative analyses could be attempted only more recently , having at disposal the extensive , high precision data from jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "such analyses fall into two main categories :    _ i ) _ quark model / symmetries - based , refs.@xcite .",
    "these analyze the leading order matrix elements for the quark proton scattering subprocess and study the conditions under which the dis cross section which is proportional to the incoherent sum of the squares of the constituent charges , can in average connect smoothly to the resonance production portion of the cross section which is given by the square of the coherent sum of the constituent charges .",
    "this connection is regulated by parity transformations .",
    "it was , in fact , shown how the excitation of resonance states of opposite parity interferes destructively in all cases except for the leading twist .",
    "no account of perturbative processes enters this model .    _",
    "ii ) _ pqcd - based , refs . @xcite .",
    "this approach claims that only after a complete perturbative qcd analysis is performed can one _ define _ duality by quantitatively establishing whether , and to what extent , this phenomenon is responsible for the apparent cancellation of multiparton correlations .",
    "it was noticed that the extension of nlo pqcd evolution to large @xmath1 must include large @xmath1 resummation effects .",
    "the overall effect of these is to shift the scale at which @xmath16 is calculated to lower values , with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "standard analyses require the presence of additional power corrections , or dynamical higher twists , to achieve a fully quantitative fit .",
    "our analysis , however , being regulated by the value of the qcd running coupling in the infrared region that enters through large @xmath1 resummation effects , brings to a suppression of higher twist effects . these get , in fact , absorbed in the coupling s infrared behavior .",
    "although these two approaches have been considered so far complementary to each other , a unified description might derive through the definition of the effective coupling @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present an overview of the large @xmath1 data , and discuss a few aspects of the evolution mechanism for dis at large @xmath1 where two scales related to the invariant mass and to the four - momentum transfer , are simultaneously present .",
    "we then illustrate in section 3 the connection between large @xmath1 data and the coupling in the infrared region : we argue that once the range of validity of parton - hadron duality is defined quantitatively , a precise pqcd analysis at large @xmath1 would open up the possibility of extracting the strong coupling constant at low scale . in section 4",
    "we draw our conclusions",
    "our studies of the physical origin of duality , and of its impact on our understanding of the nucleon s structure started a few years ago when we set up a program to quantitatively extract the scale dependence of the large @xmath1 jlab hall c data @xcite . in the analysis performed in refs.@xcite we addressed several effects that have a large impact at large @xmath1 , namely target mass corrections ( tmcs ) , large @xmath1 resummation effects , and higher twists .",
    "this work was then completed , and extended to polarized data in ref .",
    "an important point emerged from refs .",
    "@xcite that a deeper understanding was needed of those aspects unique to the large @xmath1 perturbative qcd analysis .    high precision inclusive unpolarized electron - nucleon scattering data on both hydrogen and deuterium targets from jefferson lab are available to date in the large @xmath1 , multi - gev regime ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "because of the precision of the data one should now be able to distinguish among different sources of scaling violations affecting the structure functions in addition to standard nlo evolution ,    * target mass corrections ( tmc ) , * large @xmath1 resummation effects ( lxr ) * nuclear effects * dynamical higher twists ( hts ) , * impact of next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) perturbative evolution .    all of the effects above can be extracted with an associated theoretical error .",
    "it is in fact well known that their evaluation is model dependent .",
    "recent studies , however , have been directed at determining more precisely both the origin and size of the associated theoretical error .",
    "recent analyses have been taking into account , so far , some but not all of the effects listed above @xcite .",
    "the inclusive dis cross section of unpolarized electrons off an unpolarized proton is written in terms of the two structure functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the initial electron energy .",
    "the structure functions are related by the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is ratio of the longitudinal to transverse virtual photo - absorption cross sections . in qcd , @xmath17 is expanded in series of inverse powers of @xmath4 , obtained by ordering the matrix elements in the dis process by increasing twist @xmath25 , which is equal to their dimension minus spin @xmath26 the first term is the leading twist ( lt ) , with @xmath27 .",
    "the terms of order @xmath28 , @xmath29 , in eq.([t - exp ] ) are the higher order terms , generally referred to as higher twists @xcite .    _ target mass corrections _    tmcs",
    "are included in @xmath30 . for @xmath4 @xmath31 1 gev@xmath15 ,",
    "tmcs can be taken into account through the following expansion @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the structure function in the absence of tmcs .",
    "a more recent analysis @xcite re - examined tmcs within the collinear factorization approach of @xcite in order to address the longstanding question of the unphysical behavior in the threshold region of eq.([tmc ] ) .",
    "this originates from the fact that as @xmath0 , one obtains a @xmath4-dependent threshold , namely @xmath34 for @xmath35 , therefore rendering @xmath17 undefinable as @xmath4 varies ( see discussion in @xcite ) . in the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , tmcs , applied to the helicity dependent structure functions read @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 .",
    "the final quark is assumed to hadronize into a jet of mass @xmath38 with a a process dependent distribution / smearing function @xmath39 . in our extraction",
    "we take the perspective that the evaluation of tmcs is always associated with the evaluation of hts ",
    "tmcs should in principle be applied also to hts  in an inseparable way .",
    "therefore we consistently keep terms of @xmath40 @xcite , whether in the formalism / prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite or of ref .",
    "@xmath41 , then , represents the `` genuine '' ht correction that involves interactions between the struck parton and the spectators or , formally , multi - parton correlation functions .",
    "_ threshold resummation _    in order to understand the nature of the remaining @xmath4 dependence that can not be described by nlo pqcd evolution",
    ", we also include the effect of threshold resummation , or large @xmath1 resummation ( lxr ) .",
    "lxr effects arise formally from terms containing powers of @xmath42 , @xmath43 being the longitudinal variable in the evolution equations , that are present in the wilson coefficient functions @xmath44 .",
    "below we write schematically how the latter relate the parton distributions to _ e.g. _ the structure function @xmath17 , @xmath45 where we have considered only the non - singlet ( ns ) contribution to @xmath17 since only valence quarks distributions are relevant in our kinematics .",
    "the logarithmic terms in @xmath44 become very large at large @xmath1 , and they need to be resummed to all orders in @xmath16 .",
    "resummation was first introduced by linking this issue to the definition of the correct kinematical variable that determines the phase space for the radiation of gluons at large @xmath1 .",
    "this was found to be @xmath46 , instead of @xmath4 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the argument of the strong coupling constant becomes @xmath43-dependent : @xmath47 @xcite . in this procedure , however , an ambiguity is introduced , related to the need of continuing the value of @xmath16 for low values of its argument , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "although on one side , the size of this ambiguity could be of the same order of the ht corrections and , therefore , a source of theoretical error , on the other by performing an accurate analysis such as the one proposed here , one can extract @xmath16 for values of the scale in the infrared region .",
    "we address this point in more detail in the next section .",
    "_ nuclear effects _    theoretical uncertainties in the deuteron are taken routinely into account , and are expected to be in sufficient control ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "uncertainties arise mainly from    _ i ) _ different models of the so called nuclear emc effect ;    _ ii ) _ different deuteron wave functions derived from currently available nn potentials , giving rise to different amounts of high momentum components ;    _ iii ) _ the interplay between nucleon off - shellness and tmc in nuclei .",
    "finally , we did not consider nnlo calculations , these are not expected to alter substantially our extraction since , differently from what seen originally in the case of @xmath49 , these have been proven to give a relatively small contribution to @xmath17 .",
    "once all of the above effects have been subtracted from the data , and assuming the validity of the twist expansion , eq.([t - exp ] ) in this region , one can interpret more reliably any remaining discrepancy in terms of hts .",
    "obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using dis data and including the effect of tmc . adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ]    since we extend our @xmath1-dependent analysis to the resonance region we consider the following integrated quantities @xmath50 where @xmath51 is evaluated using the experimental data in the resonance region . for each @xmath4 value : @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 delimit the resonance region , and @xmath56 is the average value of @xmath1 for each kinematics .",

    "no theoretical uncertainty was included .",
    "however , our results clearly show that the combined effects of tmcs and lxr substantially reduce @xmath62 .",
    "we take this as illustrative of the accomplishments one can expect from the analysis we suggest in this contribution .",
