    "<S> different laser devices working as `` atom diodes '' or `` one - way barriers '' for ultra - cold atoms have been proposed recently . </S>",
    "<S> they transmit ground state level atoms coming from one side , say from the left , but reflect them when they come from the other side . </S>",
    "<S> we combine a previous model , consisting of the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) from the ground to an excited state and a state - selective mirror potential , with a localized quenching laser which produces spontaneous decay back to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids backwards motion , provides more control of the decay process and therefore a more compact and useful device .    </S>",
    "<S> atom optics is devoted to the understanding and control of coherent atomic waves interacting with electromagnetic fields or material structures , and much of its current development is inspired by analogies with electronics and photonics . </S>",
    "<S> many optical elements such as lenses , mirrors , splitters , or interferometers have been proposed and demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ultra - cold atoms can also be transported coherently along waveguides , and this opens up the possibility to develop atom circuits or chips @xcite . to that end </S>",
    "<S> , basic circuit elements and operations have to be implemented ; among them , an important one is the `` diode '' or `` one - way barrier '' , which lets atoms , typically in the ground state , pass in one direction but blocks them in the opposite direction , within a `` working '' velocity range . </S>",
    "<S> such a device may have a significant impact for trapping and cooling in waveguides or other geometries . in a series of recent papers @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the present authors and coworkers have proposed and analyzed the properties of different laser devices and atom - level schemes which achieve on paper the goal of one - way transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to use them for phase - space compression in a cooling procedure complementary to the existing ones @xcite is an exciting prospect that deserves further research and motivates several ongoing experimental and theoretical efforts in which this paper may be framed .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we tackle a significant practical improvement for some of the proposed diode implementations : the use of a quenching laser to induce at will excited state decay . </S>",
    "<S> a good diode must involve an irreversible decay step so that time - reversed trajectories associated with backwards motion in the `` forbidden '' direction do not occur . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a simple one dimensional ( 1d ) diode scheme , ground state atoms coming from the left within a broad velocity range are transmitted to the right in some excited state whereas ground state atoms from the right are blocked by a state - selective mirror . while this may be enough for some purposes , the absence of an irreversible decay from the excited state would mean , according to the unitarity of the collision matrix , that an excited atom could cross the device leftwards . since excited atoms could come back towards the diode because of collisions or external forces , a truly one - way device , reliable when atom returns are possible , requires the irreversible decay of the excited atoms in a time scale smaller than the return time . </S>",
    "<S> this condition may occur naturally by a direct spontaneous decay . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , long lived excited states need a long time to decay or , equivalently , the atom has to travell a long distance to decay , which leads to a spatially wide `` atom diode '' , a drawback for cooling applications . to remedy this problem , it is possible to force at will the irreversible decay via a quenching laser , as it is explored and demonstrated here .    in our model </S>",
    "<S> the atom has the three - level structure of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] with spontaneous decay from @xmath0 .     </S>",
    "<S> atomic level structure for the diode model . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the atomic motion is effectively 1d and use a combination of `` stokes '' and `` pumping '' stirap lasers @xcite with position dependent rabi frequencies @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , a state - selective mirror laser , and a quenching laser with rabi frequencies @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their spatial location is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .     spatial localization of the lasers . in the calculations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . ]    a similar model of the three - level atom diode has been proposed in @xcite without quenching potential , but with spontaneous decay from @xmath9 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate @xmath10 must be small enough such that the probability for spontaneous decay is negligible before the rightwards - traveling atom has passed the state - selective mirror ( see @xcite for details ) , but the small decay rate implies a spatially wide `` atom diode '' region . for a full description of the atomic dynamics corresponding to figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , including the possibility of several spontaneous emission cycles , the following 1d master equation must be examined @xcite : @xmath11_- - \\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\{|2\\ra \\la 2|,\\rho\\}_+ \\\\ & + & \\!\\gamma\\!\\int_{-1}^{1 } \\!\\!du \\frac{3}{8 } ( 1+u^2 )   { \\exp \\left ( i\\frac{mv_{rec}}{\\hbar } u x \\right ) } \\,|1\\!\\ra \\la 2|\\rho|2\\ra   \\la 1|\\ , { \\exp \\left ( -i\\frac{mv_{rec}}{\\hbar } u x \\right ) } , \\nonumber \\label{master_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the recoil velocity , @xmath13 is the mass , and the initial condition is taken as a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , the non - hermitian conditional hamiltonian is @xmath17 all potential terms are chosen as gaussian functions with equal widths @xmath18 and maximal heights @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that the distance @xmath25 is not too small because otherwise the mirror potential spoils the stirap transfer , and of course @xmath26 must hold such that the atom crossing rightwards has passed the mirror potential before it decays to state @xmath27 .    in the quantum - jump approach , the master equation ( [ master_eq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is solved by averaging over `` trajectories '' with time intervals in which the wave function evolves with the conditional hamiltonian interrupted by random jumps ( decay events ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the dynamics before the first spontaneous photon emission is described by a simple schrdinger equation using the conditional hamiltonian @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the stirap process @xmath29 is characterized by its stability with respect to atom velocity and the fact that it is not much affected by the decay @xmath30 , since the adiabatic state realizing the transfer is not composed by 2 at all . </S>",
    "<S> also , because of the position of the quenching laser promoting spontaneous decay from 2 and the assumed level structure , it will be extremely unlikely to have more than one pumping - emission cycle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the dynamics under the conditional hamiltonian will be essentially enough to determine the quality and behaviour of the diode . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it will help us to select good values for the laser parameters . </S>",
    "<S> so let us examine the stationary schrdinger equation with @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath31 and @xmath32 to denote the channels associated with the internal states , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , let us denote as @xmath35 the reflection amplitude for an atom incident with velocity @xmath36 ( positive or negative , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) in channel @xmath31 and reflected in channel @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , let @xmath37 be the transmission amplitude from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we examine the case without quenching potential ( @xmath38 ) but with @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath40 have to be chosen large enough such that all ground state atoms incident from the left are transmitted into state 3 ( i.e. @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) whereas from the right they are reflected in a velocity interval ( i.e. @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) .    reflection probability @xmath45 ( solid line ) , transmission probability @xmath46 ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> here and in the following figures , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath13 is the mass of neon . ]    figure [ fig3 ] shows that this is true for the chosen parameters . </S>",
    "<S> notice the stability of the results with respect to velocity because of the adiabatic passage .    without a quenching laser , </S>",
    "<S> the process 3@xmath511 from the right , however , would be also permitted and in fact very efficient . </S>",
    "<S> we shall now include the quenching laser and calculate again the transmission probability for the process @xmath52 , namely , @xmath53 for @xmath42 .     </S>",
    "<S> transmission probability @xmath54 for different @xmath22 ; @xmath49 ( solid line ) , @xmath55 ( thick dotted line ) , @xmath56 ( dotted line ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4 ] shows that by increasing @xmath22 it is possible to suppress totally @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> since reflection for ground state atoms coming from the left is still negligible , this means that the norm of a wave function of atoms incident in level 1 from the left is absorbed totally under the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , nearly all atoms incident in state 1 from the left will emit a spontaneous photon . </S>",
    "<S> because the emission will take place very likely close to the quenching potential , the atom will finally travel to the right in the ground state , as confirmed below by solving the master equation . </S>",
    "<S> all other probabilities represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] remain unchanged ; in particular , the atoms coming from the right in the ground state 1 are unaffected by the quenching laser but blocked by the selective mirror potential . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that , even atoms incident from the right in 3 will be blocked if the decay provoked by the quenching laser occurs in a time scale which is enough for the atom to arrive at the mirror potential in state 1 .    in principle , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath22 is too large there could be reflection of an atom incident in level 1 from the left but this possibility plays no role for the parameters examined here . </S>",
    "<S> so the quenching laser has a range of intensities and velocities for which the desired effect ( perfect decay of atoms in level 3 ) is stable . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is also discussed for a single pumping laser without diode in @xcite .    to confirm that the quenching laser is indeed improving the device significantly </S>",
    "<S> we shall solve the 1d master equation ( [ master_eq ] ) using the quantum trajectory approach .     </S>",
    "<S> probabilities @xmath57 ( filled circles ) and @xmath58 ( boxes ) versus @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) or @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) @xmath67 ( averaged over @xmath68 trajectories ) , ( b ) @xmath69 ( averaged over @xmath70 trajectories ) . , title=\"fig : \" ]   probabilities @xmath57 ( filled circles ) and @xmath58 ( boxes ) versus @xmath59 . </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath75 be a large time such that the resulting wave packet @xmath76 of almost every quantum `` trajectory '' @xmath77 separates into right and left moving parts far from the interaction region . by averaging over all trajectories </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath78 which is the probability to find the atom on the right - hand side and in the ground state , and also @xmath79 which is the probability to find the atom moving to the right at time @xmath75 in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the results , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , confirm the prediction of the stationary schrdinger equation with the conditional hamiltonian : a perfect transfer is produced from ground to ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars ( defined by the difference between averaging over @xmath74 and over @xmath80 trajectories ) are smaller than the symbol size .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> a quenching laser has been included in an atom diode laser device . </S>",
    "<S> using quenching to force decay to the ground state after crossing the diode provides a significant improvement over previous schemes based on small direct spontaneous decay . with quenching , </S>",
    "<S> possible crossings in the wrong direction are suppressed and the atom which has crossed the diode in the allowed direction needs less time to decay , or in other words , the spatial region occupied by the atom diode is much narrower than in the case of direct decay . </S>",
    "<S> quenching could be used in realistic atomic systems such as calcium , strontium , or ytterbium which are currently of interest for frequency standards . </S>"
