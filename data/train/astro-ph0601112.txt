    "# 1[*todo : # 1 ] *    the hubble deep field south ( hdf - s ) is one of the deepest imaging fields in the sky .",
    "it was observed in 1998 ( williams et al .",
    "2000 ) by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) as a counterpart to the northern hubble deep field ( hdf - n ) .",
    "however in contrast to the northern field it was selected to contain a bright qso j2233 - 606 at @xmath8 in order to facilitate studies of the connection between foreground galaxies and absorbing systems in the qso spectrum .    the determination of precise redshifts for extra - galactic sources has been important since the time of hubble ( 1929 ) .",
    "while much spectroscopy has been done in the other hubble deep field , hdf - s has lagged behind . as a community service and in order to test new instrumentation techniques , in particular ` nod & shuffle ' ( glazebrook & bland - hawthorn 2001 ; gb01 ) with very small ` microslits ' , we carried out a spectroscopic campaign of galaxies in , and in the vicinity of , the hdf - s in order to obtain redshifts .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : section 2 details the prime focus pre - imaging , the procedures used to construct the photometric catalog and the selection of the spectroscopic targets . in section 3 we describe our novel spectroscopic observations and the special data reduction procedures used . in section 4 we present our spectroscopic catalog and its basic parameters and compare with other work in this field and discuss the possible galaxy cluster at @xmath5 .",
    "the finding charts , images , spectra , photometric and spectroscopic catalogs presented in this paper are all available from the anglo - australian observatory web site at :    http://www.aao.gov.au/hdfs/redshifts",
    "we obtained pre - imaging data ( prior to the hst campaign ) from which our sample of targets for spectroscopic follow - up were selected .",
    "images in @xmath0 and @xmath1 were taken with the anglo australian telescope prime focus ccd camera ( 0.391 @xmath9pixel ) in may 1999 at two pointings containing the wfpc ( ` aat - wf ' ) and stis ( ` aat - st ' ) fields respectively . when stacked and mosaicked , they cover a contiguous area of @xmath10 centered on 22@xmath11 33@xmath1218.68@xmath13 @xmath1460@xmath1531@xmath1645.8@xmath17 ( j2000 ) ) which includes the hst deep fields and their flanking fields .",
    "all images were taken in photometric conditions and 0.8  seeing , except for the @xmath0-band aat - st data ( 2.2  through thick clouds ) . a finding chart for our pointing",
    "is given in figure  [ star_fig ] .",
    "the images were de - biased , flat - fielded and mosaiced following standard ccd procedures .",
    "all images were registered to the usno - a2.0 reference frame using x- and y - shifts and rotation .",
    "the internal astrometric offset between sources in overlapping frames is measured to be @xmath18 0.12 .",
    "an all - sky photometric solution was determined from observations of 7 landolt ( 1992 ) fields using 29 stars .",
    "@xmath0-band images taken in non - photometric conditions and were calibrated using overlap areas with photometric images ( accurate to @xmath19 mags residual scatter ) .",
    "a source catalogue was extracted using sextractor version 2.2.1 ( bertin and arnouts , 1996 ) .",
    "sextractor was run in the standard manner using a low detection threshold of 1@xmath20 and a minimum of 3 connected pixels to define the extraction .",
    "we used a local determination from the sky to accurately handle data with variable sky levels .",
    "this is particularly important since the images suffer from strong stray light pollution from an off - image star to the north of the field ( hd 213479 at 22@xmath11 33@xmath2110.97@xmath13 @xmath1460@xmath2226@xmath1600.4@xmath17 , @xmath0=8.1 ) . in order to maximise the reliability of the final catalogue without compromising the faint source detection , we flagged sources which lie in areas most strongly affected by straylight or in vignetted regions as ` masked ' to minimise the number of spurious extractions .",
    "only sources lying within unmasked regions are considered as targets and for further analysis .",
    "the magnitudes presented in the final catalogue are sextractor mag_auto magnitudes determined using an automated adapative aperture technique .",
    "the final photometric catalog is given in table  [ tab : phot ] ( electronic edition only ) .",
    "we extracted an extragalactic catalogue using star - galaxy separation and analysed the resulting extragalactic number counts .",
    "we chose to use the object s magnitude and a measure of surface brightness ( magnitude / fwhm@xmath23 ) as our star - galaxy separator as it provides a cleaner cut at faint magnitudes than sextractor s classifier or the commonly used core : total indicator .",
    "our number - magnitude analysis showed the counts of galaxies to be still increasing as a power - law to @xmath1=24 , consistent with close to 100% completeness at this depth .",
    "the formal magnitude limit of the images , measured from the noise in random 0.8  diameter apertures placed on blank regions is @xmath1=25.30 , 25.16 ( wf , st ) for a 3@xmath20 detection .",
    "this is also consistent with the images being highly complete at @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath0-data reaches 25.18 ( wf ) and 23.97 ( st , 2 aperture  due to the poorer seeing ) . at @xmath24",
    "galaxies overwhelmingly dominate stars and so we chose to select spectroscopic targets from a purely @xmath1 magnitude limited catalog to this depth .",
    "@xmath24 was somewhat deeper than we expected to reach with spectroscopy even under the best conditions , however we expected to go deeper for objects with strong emission lines and we also desired a high surface density to test the ` microslit ' spectroscopy described below so our final strategy was to observe a lot of objects and tolerate a lower completeness .",
    "the final list of objects that made it on to the slit - mask was based solely on geometrical considerations .",
    "finally , we note that the spectroscopic selection was done on a preliminary version of the final astrometric and photometric table presented here .",
    "we find that the positions and magnitudes reproduce well between the preliminary catalog and the final version ( @xmath25 arcsec and @xmath26 mag systematic differences ) .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were made with the anglo - australian telescopes low dispersion survey spectrograph ( wynne & worswick 1988 ) .",
    "this instrument ( ldss ) was designed for multi - slit imaging spectroscopy and offers a wide circular ( 12.3 arcmin diameter ) field of view .",
    "data was taken in october 1998 during a commissioning run to test the following new features :    1 .   a new deep - depletion ccd detector from mit lincoln labs ( see burke et al .",
    "2004 for details on these devices ) had just been installed offering improved red sensitivity .",
    "the deep depletion of high - resitivity p - type silicon causes pixels to be up to 40  deep , this allows more depth for a photon to be detected and improves the quantum efficiency @xmath27  where silicon is becoming increasingly transparent .",
    "it also reduces the effect of fringing .",
    "we obtained a @xmath28 pixel device ( 15  pixels giving 0.395 arcsec @xmath9 pixel ) .",
    "the red quantum efficiency peaked at 87% at 7000  and maintained 16% at 10,000 .",
    "( tinney & barton 1998 ) .",
    "2 .   a new red - optimized grism based on a volume phase holographic ( vph ) grating from kaiser optical systems was tested .",
    "vph gratings offer improved throughput ( barden et al .",
    "this was the first test of a low - resolution vph grating designed for redshift measurements in a multi - object system and proved successful .",
    "the peak efficiency was measured to be 82% at 6700  ( glazebrook 1998 ) .",
    "the grating delivered a dispersion of 2.6  per pixel with the mit / ll ccd and a one arcsec slit projected to @xmath29 pixels giving 8  spectral resolution .",
    "3 .   the use of ` nod & shuffle ' ( gb01 ) for accurate sky - subtraction for the first time in a multi - object configuration . 4 .   the use of very small slits ( ` microslits ' ) , enabled by nod & shuffle , to allow large multiplex , as described below .",
    "the nod & shuffle technique for highly accurate sky - subtraction is extensively described in gb01 . in a nutshell",
    "the technique uses an unilluminated part of the ccd as a storage area for an image of the sky . observing consists of taking an image of the objects through the slits , clocking the ccd voltage pattern",
    "so this image is ` shuffled ' in to the storage , nodding a few arcsecs , taking an image of the sky through the slits , and repeating .",
    "the result is quasi - simultaneous images of the object and sky adjacent on the ccd .",
    "this is done rapidly to track sky variations , e.g. for hdf - s we took 30 sec images at object and sky positions ( plus a 2 sec deadtime to allow for telescope settling ) .",
    "the sequence is repeated 30@xmath30 giving an 1800 sec ( 900 sec on object ) exposure .",
    "readout noise only becomes important during the final clock - out , charge shuffling is essentially noiseless as long as the ccd has good charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) .",
    "sky - subtraction then consists of windowing the sky region of the image and then subtracting it from the object region which is offset by an exactly known number of pixels . with the setup employed here the systematic sky residuals",
    "do not exceed 0.04% ( measured in gb01 ) .",
    "many schemes are possible for laying out positions of slits and storage areas on the detector . whether one can shuffle a long distance or a short distance depends on the cte and the number of charge traps on the detector ( each trap causes a trail of charge when shuffled ) . for example",
    "abraham et .",
    "2004 ) in their later gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) observations used 2 arcsec long rectangular slitlets , and ` microshuffled ' the charge only one slit length .",
    "the storage was immediately below the detector so effectively 50% of the gmos fov was available to slits .",
    "for these small shuffles cte is not critical , also the gmos ccds had hundreds of charge traps so small shuffles was desirable .",
    "for our observations the mitll3 ccd only had 12 traps and the cte was 99.9999% which allowed us to make large ` macroshuffles ' across the whole device .",
    "we chose to follow the scheme shown in figure  [ fig - ns ] which is motivated by the fact that the mitll3 device is physically much larger than the ldss focal plane .",
    "one third of the device ( 1365 pixels = 9.0 arcmin ) is used for imaging , the rest for storage .",
    "75% of the ldss fov is available for slits , which is advantageous , but we have to shuffle 1365 pixels .",
    "this is not a problem with the high cte , tests in the lab showed significant image degradation did not happen until several hundred macroshuffle operations had been performed .",
    "finally , we note that the fov advantage in macroshuffling is only gained when the fov greatly underfills the ccd and would not be applicable , for example , to gmos .",
    "the unconventional approach taken with the spectroscopic masks was that instead of using rectangular slitlets we used small circular holes in the mask at the location of target galaxies .",
    "the logic was that the usual reason to employ an extended rectangular slit several arcsecs long is to sample neighboring sky for sky - subtraction . with the nod & shuffle technique this need",
    "is obviated .",
    "thus one only needs apertures large enough to receive the light from typical targets in the expected seeing .",
    "normal ldss slitlets are of order 510 arcsec in length , thus with 1 arcsec ` microslits ' we could obtain a 510@xmath30 larger multiplex .",
    "ideally we would have used square holes so that the spectral psf would be uniform across the target but due to hardware limitations of our particular mask cutter it turned out to be much easier to simply drill circular holes .",
    "the psf variation is not important for one dimensional spectra summed across the slit and does not affect nod & shuffle sky subtraction as objects and sky are observed through exactly the _ same _ slits ( this is confirmed by the essentially poisson - limited sky subtraction in the final spectra ) .",
    "note we planned to do the observations in the best aat seeing ( @xmath31 arcsec ) and so we cut one arcsec holes ( 150   diameter ) .",
    "the masks were available immediately before the run but there was no opportunity to measure them until after the run . using a microscope we later measured the diameters to be on average 0.7 arcsec , this would have resulted unfortunately in light loss given the actual seeing .",
    "this non - optimal size lessened our final spectroscopic depth .",
    "slit allocation was done using a custom algorithm which simply maximizes the number of non - overlapping target spectra for a given position angle .",
    "we chose @xmath32 ( i.e. along the stis  wfpc2 axis ) in order to maximize the number of targets allocated within the hubble camera fields .",
    "we found the typical overall number of slits allocated by our algorithm was not sensitive to this choice .",
    "the position angle is not optimal for atmospheric dispersion , however since we were doing red spectroscopy this would not have been a significant source of light loss . using the red vph grating the 2048 pixels in the dispersion ( ccd row )",
    "direction gives 5300  wavelength coverage .",
    "the typical wavelength range observed for a slit on the mask center was 500010000 .",
    "slits were allowed to be as far as 1.5 arcmin off - axis resulting in wavelength coverage shifts of up to 590 .",
    "thus it was only possible to accommodate one object at each ccd row ( i.e. one tier ) .",
    "slit allocation allowed a minimum one pixel gap between objects to cleanly delineate spectra , thus the maximum possible number of holes was 348 . running the algorithm on the @xmath3 hdf - s catalog for a mask center of 22@xmath33 33@xmath34 11@xmath35 @xmath36",
    "33@xmath37 16@xmath38 gave an allocation of 225 objects ( after taking out some space to allow for larger holes for alignment stars ) in the @xmath39 arcmin @xmath30 9 arcmin field .",
    "this compares with a normal ldss mask setup without nod & shuffle where one normally only gets spectra of 2030 objects .",
    "the drawback of this strategy is that the objects are out of the slits for half the time when the telescope is in the sky position .",
    "an alternate nod & shuffle approach would be to use slightly larger slitlets so the object is still in the slit in both nod positions ( e.g. abraham et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however this means in general one can only observe half as many objects because the slits are twice the spatial size , for a _ high sky density survey _ there is no net difference in the number of objects observed to a given depth in a given amount of telescope time .",
    "the observations were carried out over the nights of 1316@xmath40 october , 1998 at the aat .",
    "conditions were photometric and the seeing was 11.5 arcsec .",
    "the red vph grating was used with a gg475 blocking filter , so the spectra are potentially contaminated by second order for @xmath41 9000 , though this effect was not in practice seen in any spectra .",
    "the filter was also not anti - reflection coated causing some ghosts in the spectral images .",
    "the total exposure time obtained on the hdf - s field was 12 hours ( half on sky ) .",
    "the main calibrations taken were arc spectra for wavelength calibration and white - light dispersed flat fields ( through the mask ) .",
    "the flatfields served the dual purpose of removing pixel sensitivity variations and allow the spectra location on the detector to be mapped empirically .",
    "the format of the data shares similarities both with classical multislit spectra and with fiber spectra .",
    "each small circular aperture produces a spectral trace ( ` tramline ' ) on the ccd image .",
    "a portion of this data is shown in figure  [ fig - datared ] .",
    "we reduced the data using a mixture of _ iraf _ ( tody 1986 ) tasks and custom _ perl data language _",
    "( glazebrook & economou 1997 ) scripts .",
    "first the individual images were sky - subtracted , using the shuffle offset to map the sky pixels to the object pixels .",
    "the images ( + arcs and flats ) were then corrected for small alignment shifts throughout the night and registered and stacked with a cosmic ray filter .",
    "the flat - field was used to map the spectra tramline locations and also the psf width as a function of wavelength for optimal extraction of 1d object , sky ( for reference ) , arc and flat - field spectra .",
    "the flat - field spectra were then normalized with a polynomial fit in the spectral direction and divided in to the object spectra to correct them for high frequency pixel / wavelength sensitivity variations .",
    "an overall wavelength solution was derived from the arc and sky spectra ( @xmath42   rms ) .",
    "care was taken to propagate variance arrays ( with initial errors calculated from the ccd readnoise and gain using photon statistics ) through every step of the data reduction so errors could be assigned to the final spectra .",
    "one important point about the data reduction is that the shuffled sky must be subtracted _ before _ flat - fielding .",
    "this is a key advantage of nod & shuffle : accurate sky - subtraction does not require flat fielding . in the shuffled image",
    "the relevant pixel response is that of the original pixel and not the storage pixel .",
    "so the correct procedure is to subtract the sky first .",
    "the pixel response is the same and the sky subtracts correctly .",
    "then applying the flat field will correct the flat field error in the object correctly .",
    "if the flat field is imperfectly measured this only affects the object spectrum . reversing the procedure , i.e. flat fielding before sky subtraction will actually result in an erroneous flat field correction .",
    "redshifts were determined from the final set of 225 target spectra by careful visual inspection and are given in table  [ tab - spec ] along with key spectral features used for identification and a subjective quality system  @xmath43 denotes a dead certain redshift ( @xmath44% confidence ) , @xmath45 is ` quite certain ' ( @xmath46% confidence ) , @xmath47 is a ` possible identication ' ( @xmath48% confidence ) , @xmath49 is a single emission line redshift assumed to be [ oii ] ( which is the best a priori guess given the likely redshift range at @xmath3 and wavelength coverage ) and @xmath50 represents no identification .    out of the 225 objects",
    "there were ( 24 , 19 , 22,8 , 152 ) objects with @xmath51 respectively .",
    "thus 73 identifications ( 33% ) were made of which 20 were galactic stars .",
    "the completeness was 79% , 63% , 46% at @xmath52 21 , 22 , 23 respectively .",
    "many of the faint @xmath53 identifications were for objects with strong emission lines .",

    "fits format spectra ( and variance spectra ) are available on the web site . in the final list",
    "we identify five galaxies and two stars within the deep wfpc-2 field and one galaxy in the stis field .",
    "spectroscopy in the hdf - s vicinity has also been done by tresse et al .",
    "( 1999 ; t99 ) , vanzella et al ( 2002 ; v02 ) and sawicki & malln - ornelas ( 2004 ; sm03 ) . t99 published redshifts obtained with the ntt for nine objects within 1 arcmin of the qso with @xmath54 , three of these are on our mask of which we identify one ( # 20 ) as a star , however this is only a @xmath47 confidence .",
    "the other two we do not identify .",
    "v02 obtained 50 redshifts using the vlt in the range @xmath5525 ( 75% complete at @xmath56 ) with an emphasis on color selected @xmath57 galaxies .",
    "we find three identifications in common , all agree at the @xmath58 level .",
    "sm03 obtained 97 ` secure ' redshifts for sources with @xmath59 using the vlt .",
    "five of their objects are also identified by us , all are high confidence redshifts ( except for one single emission line redshift ) and all agree to within @xmath60 .",
    "there is one object ( # 204 ) which appears both in v02 , sm03 and in our catalog , all at the same redshift .",
    "if we exclude the objects in common with the other spectroscopic catalogs we find we have identified 45 new extragalactic objects in the hdf - s and flanking fields . excluding all objects in common there are now 206 unique galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from all the hdf - s catalogs considered here .",
    "another interesting comparison is with catalogs based on photometric redshifts . here",
    "the wfpc-2 field allows accurate photometric redshifts because of the depth and 3 colors . in order to compare we define the fractional error on the redshift as @xmath61 , comparing with the catalog of gwyn ( 1999 ) we find that @xmath62 between the catalogs ( 5 galaxies , 2 stars ) .",
    "we also compare with the ` stony - brook ' catalog which is based on the hdf - n methods of fernndez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . here",
    "we find a big discrepancy in object # 871 which stony - brook identifies as a star and we identify as a @xmath63 galaxy , albeit with very low confidence ( @xmath47 ) . excluding this object we again find @xmath62 between the catalogs ( 4 galaxies , 2 stars ) .",
    "the resulting redshift distributions are compared in figure  [ fig - nz ] .",
    "v02 reported an over - density near the wfpc2 pointing at @xmath5 after combining our data ( based on our initial www report ) with theirs .",
    "it can be seen that the redshift spike is at it s most prominent in our dataset .",
    "if we look at the combined redshift distribution in figure  [ fig - nz ] it can be seen that there are a number of spikes , as is typical for narrow field redshift surveys , and that the @xmath64 spike is not the most prominent of them .",
    "however the stis qso displays a strong absorption line system at @xmath65 ( t99 ) coincident in redshift with a bright spiral galaxy so it is interesting to explore this further .",
    "this can be done by looking at the distribution on the sky .",
    "figure  [ fig - sky ] shows a comparison of the locations of the galaxies at @xmath66 compared to all the galaxies from this work , sm03 , t99 and v02 ( after removing all duplicate objects ) .",
    "it is clear that there is a compact cluster of galaxies at this redshift flanking and overlapping with the sw corner of the wfpc2 field .",
    "the cluster is of order one arcmin in size which is fairly typical for large clusters at these redshifts .",
    "taking an approximate cluster center of @xmath67 arcmin wrt the wfpc2 field we count 16 galaxies within a one arcmin radius and with @xmath66 .",
    "the redshift distribution of galaxies in this circle is shown in the lower half of figure  [ fig - sky ] and it can now be seen that there is again a single prominent spike at @xmath5 . since the overdensity is compact in two dimensions on the sky and also in redshift this is likely to be a cluster rather than a filament of large scale structure .",
    "for the 16 galaxies we find @xmath68 corresponding to a velocity dispersion @xmath69 @xmath70 1500 km s@xmath71 .",
