    "in a paper on the b meson decay process @xmath0  @xcite , the belle collaboration  @xcite reported the observation of a distinct and relatively narrow peak in the @xmath13 mass spectrum near @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis was performed by excluding the events in the @xmath15 regions of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and fitting the one - dimensional @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the fit gave a resonance mass and width of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic ; the significance of the resonance was @xmath21 .",
    "if this peak , called the @xmath22 , is interpreted as a meson state , then it must have an exotic structure ; its minimal quark content is @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath22 observation motivated a subsequent belle study of the process @xmath24 , where a doubly peaked structure was observed in the @xmath25 invariant mass distribution  @xcite . in this channel ,",
    "the observed structure is rather wide , therefore a full dalitz plot analysis was used in order to establish that the observed peaks could be unambiguously associated with dynamics in the @xmath25 channel . if these peaks , called the @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are attributed to meson states , a minimal four - quark substructure is required .",
    "a recently reported study of @xmath0 decays by the babar collaboration  @xcite did not find a significant signal for @xmath1 ; the reported significance is at the @xmath28 level .",
    "the babar sample of @xmath0 decays is about 85% the size of the corresponding belle data sample .    in this paper",
    "we present a reanalysis of the belle @xmath0 data sample using a dalitz plot formalism .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that operates at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath29 collider  @xcite .",
    "a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath30 collected at the @xmath11 resonance and containing 657 million @xmath10 pairs is used .",
    "a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation  @xcite is used to model the response of the detector .",
    "we select events of the type @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 decays either to @xmath34 or @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 .",
    "we use the same selection criteria as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we identify @xmath40 mesons using the beam - energy constrained mass @xmath41 and the energy difference @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "beam energy , @xmath44 is the vector sum of the c.m .",
    "momenta of the @xmath40 meson decay products and @xmath45 is their c.m .",
    "energy sum .",
    "we select events with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the world - average @xmath40-meson mass  @xcite ) and @xmath48 , which are both @xmath49 windows around the peak values . to model combinatorial backgrounds , we use events that are in the @xmath50 signal region and the @xmath51 sidebands defined as @xmath52 . to improve the definition of the dalitz plot boundaries for both signal and sideband events ,",
    "we perform a mass - constrained fit to the @xmath40 candidates from both regions . simulations of the two @xmath33 decay modes indicate that the experimental resolution for @xmath18 is @xmath53 for both modes .",
    "we sum the dalitz distributions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 candidates . due to the mass difference between @xmath54 and @xmath55 the corresponding dalitz plots have slightly different boundaries .",
    "we find that this has a negligible effect on the results of the dalitz analysis .",
    "the dalitz plot for the @xmath51 signal region is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] . here vertical bands corresponding to the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 are evident .",
    "the horizontal cluster of entries in the vicinity of @xmath56 constitutes the @xmath22 signal reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "dalitz plot for the @xmath51 signal region .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) lines delimit the five vertical ( three horizontal ) slices that are used to present the fit results in subsequent figures .",
    "the coordinates of the vertical lines are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; the coordinates of the horizontal lines are @xmath61 and @xmath62 . , width=302 ]    in the following ,",
    "we illustrate the results of different fits using projected histograms of the slices of the dalitz plot indicated by the vertical solid lines and horizontal dashed lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] .",
    "the three horizontal slices correspond to @xmath18 regions below , around and above the @xmath22 mass region .",
    "the five vertical slices distinguish the @xmath16 and @xmath63 regions and bands above , below and in between them .",
    "the sum of the latter three projections corresponds to the @xmath64 veto used in ref .",
    "the decay @xmath0 with the @xmath33 reconstructed in the @xmath34 decay mode is described by four variables ( assuming the width of the @xmath33 to be negligible ) .",
    "these are taken to be @xmath18 , @xmath15 , the @xmath33 helicity angle ( @xmath65 ) and the angle between the @xmath33 production and decay planes ( @xmath66 ) . in this analysis",
    "we integrate over the angular variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the mc indicates that the reconstruction efficiency is almost uniform over the full @xmath66 angular range ; after integration over this angle the contribution from interference between the different @xmath33 helicity states is negligibly small .",
    "this allows the @xmath33 to be treated as a stable particle in the dalitz analysis .    in the @xmath67 channel , the @xmath33",
    "is likewise treated as stable .",
    "the @xmath68 system in this decay is predominantly in an @xmath69-wave  @xcite ; in this limit , the @xmath33 and @xmath70 helicity states are the same , and we again find negligible interference contributions after integration over decay angles .",
    "thus , our approach is the same as in the dalitz analysis of the @xmath24 decays in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the amplitude for the three - body decay @xmath0 is a sum over different quasi - two - body modes ; resonances are described by relativistic breit - wigner functions with angular dependence . as the default fit model , we include all known low - lying @xmath71 resonances [ the @xmath72 or @xmath73 , and the @xmath16 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and a single exotic @xmath13 resonance . in addition to the physics model , the fit function includes a background term derived from the @xmath51 sidebands and is modulated by the mc - determined experimental efficiency .",
    "the mc sample is generated using the world - average @xmath33 branching fractions  @xcite while to fix the relative fractions of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 contributions we use isospin symmetry .",
    "the dalitz plots for the @xmath51 sideband and the mc sample are smoothed .",
    "the expression for the amplitudes , signal component of the fit function , and other details of the fitting procedure are the same as used in the analysis described in ref .",

    "however , the @xmath84 fit fractions  6.8% and 6.6% for the @xmath22 and non-@xmath22 hypotheses , respectively  are very large for a resonance with a peak mass that is @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) above the kinematic limit for @xmath0 decays and for which only a small portion of the low - mass tail of the resonance is accessible .",
