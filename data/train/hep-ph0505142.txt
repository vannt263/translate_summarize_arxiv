    "in any supersymmetric ( ) extension of the standard model ( sm ) with conserved r - parity , the lightest  particle ( lsp ) constitutes a good candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "recent measurements from wmap  @xcite have constrained the value for the relic density of dark matter within 10% ( @xmath4 at @xmath5 ) .",
    "the forthcoming planck experiment should reduce this interval down to 2% .",
    "it is therefore of the utmost importance to calculate the relic density as accurately as possible in any given  model , in order to match this experimental accuracy .",
    "this has been done in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , with the publicly available program  @xcite .",
    "this code computes the relic density of the lightest neutralino lsp by evaluating the thermally averaged cross section for its annihilation as well as , when necessary , for its coannihilation with other  particles .",
    "it then solves the density evolution equation numerically , without using the freeze - out approximation .",
    "the impact of the wmap constraints on the parameter space of the mssm has been widely studied  @xcite . in the msugra",
    "inspired version of the mssm , one needs rather special conditions among parameters to have a large enough annihilation cross - section and meet the constraints of wmap .",
    "this is because the lsp is usually a bino and the main mechanism for annihilation is into fermion pairs and requires the presence of a light slepton .",
    "given the direct constraints on light sleptons and on light neutralinos as well as on the light higgs mass , this possibility is valid into a small corner of parameter space . within msugra models , to satisfy the wmap constraint one must then appeal to specific processes such as coannihilation processes , rapid annihilation through higgs exchange or some non negligible higgsino component of the neutralino lsp .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied in the so - called focus point region of msugra models . on the other hand , in the general mssm with no assumption on gut scale physic and free parameters at the electroweak ( ew ) scale ,",
    "it is much easier to satisfy the upper bound on relic density from wmap .",
    "all models with a mixed bino / higgsino or mixed bino / wino lsp annihilate much more efficiently and this even for heavy sfermions .",
    "in fact the annihilation is so efficient that the relic density often lies below the wmap range , thus implying some additional dark matter component .",
    "large higgsino component of the neutralino lsp means enhanced couplings to the @xmath6 boson and to the pseudo - scalar higgs boson @xmath7 , thus favouring annihilation channels into fermion pairs .",
    "large wino component means more efficient couplings to gauge bosons favouring annihilation channels into w pairs .",
    "furthermore coannihilation channels with a heavier neutralino and/or chargino are also enhanced for either higgsino or wino - like lsp s . in the limit where all sfermions are heavy the important parameters that enter the computation are those of the neutralino sector @xmath8 as well as the pseudo - scalar higgs mass @xmath9 .",
    "the trilinear couplings @xmath10 can play a role for the relic density as they influence the mass of the lightest higgs .",
    "it is well known , however , that the mssm faces a naturalness problem  the so - called @xmath11 problem  @xcite  arising from the presence of a conserving mass term for the higgs fields in the superpotential , @xmath12 .",
    "the only natural values for the @xmath11 parameter are either zero or the planck scale .",
    "the first is experimentally excluded while the second reintroduces the hierarchy problem .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite provides an elegant solution to the @xmath11 problem via the introduction of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath13 in the higgs sector . assuming the simplest possible scale invariant form of the superpotential , which contains the dimensionless @xmath14 coupling , the scalar component @xmath15 of the singlet acquires naturally a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order of the  breaking scale , giving rise to an effective @xmath16 of order the ew scale .",
    "the nmssm is the simplest  extension of the sm in which the ew scale originates from the breaking scale _ only_. another nice feature of the nmssm is that the fine tuning problem originating from the non - observation of a neutral higgs boson at lep , is less severe than in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "a possible cosmological domain wall problem @xcite can be avoided by introducing suitable non - renormalizable operators @xcite that do not generate dangerously large singlet tadpole diagrams @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mssm fields , the nmssm contains an extra scalar and pseudo - scalar neutral higgs bosons , as well as an additional neutralino , the singlino .",
    "the phenomenology of the model can be markedly different from the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs state is larger than in the mssm , up to 180 gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a very light higgs boson ( as light as a few gev ) is not experimentally excluded  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a very light neutralino with a large singlino component may have escaped lep searches  @xcite .",
    "all these properties could impact significantly the relic density computation in the nmssm .",
    "up to now there has been only a few studies of the relic density of dark matter in the nmssm  @xcite , although a detailed analysis of dark matter direct detection in this model was recently carried out  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a code that calculates the relic density of dark matter in the nmssm .",
    "this code provides an interface between  and .",
    "the fortran code allows a precise calculation of the particle spectrum in the nmssm , as well as a complete check of all the available experimental constraints from lep  @xcite .",
    "the parameters are then fed into a new version extended to the nmssm , which calculates _ all _ relevant cross - sections for neutralino annihilations and coannihilations and computes the relic density .    the paper is organized as follows : we first describe the model , summarize the main features of  and discuss the implementation of the nmssm into /  and . in section 3",
    "we give results for typical case studies .",
    "conclusions are given in section 4 .",

    ", we used the fortran program  @xcite , which conventions we will review now .",
    "we then discuss the implementation of the model into /  and , as well as the interface between both codes .",
    "we finally give a summary of the experimental and theoretical constraints taken into account .",
    "in addition to the standard mssm yukawa couplings for quarks and leptons , the nmssm superpotential contains two additional terms involving the higgs doublet superfields , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the gauge singlet @xmath13 w=  + ^3 .",

    "in the nmssm , the same mechanisms as for the mssm are at work for neutralino annihilation : into fermion pairs through s - channel exchange of a @xmath6 or higgs , into gauge boson pairs through either @xmath6/h s - channel exchange or t - channel exchange of heavier neutralinos or charginos .",
    "the new feature of the nmssm is the presence of additional higgs states , which means additional regions of parameter space where rapid annihilation through a s - channel resonance can take place .",
    "we found that annihilation through a higgs resonance is dominant in large regions of the parameter space and this even at low to intermediate values of @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , new channels also open up since light higgs state can be present .",
    "for example annihilation channels into @xmath243 or even @xmath220 can contribute significantly to the relic density .",
    "these proceed through s - channel @xmath6/h / a exchange or t - channel neutralino exchange . despite the additional annihilation channel available because of a richer higgs sector ,",
    "annihilation of neutralinos is not always favoured in the nmssm . in general the singlino component of",
    "the lsp tends to reduce the annihilation cross - section .",
    "therefore one expects that the relic density of dark matter strongly constrain models with a large singlino component .",
    "we found however regions of the parameter space where a singlino lsp gives the right amount of dark matter , either for large @xmath23 , s - channel resonances into a @xmath6 or a higgs , or coannihilation with @xmath237 , @xmath244 .    for a bino lsp , compatibility with the wmap result",
    "can be recovered in the nmssm .",
    "this however requires tuning the parameters of the model such that @xmath245 is only a few gev below the mass of a higgs boson . in models",
    "where @xmath246 as we have discussed here , this would also mean that one has a chargino mostly wino with a mass @xmath247 .",
    "such a degeneracy between the chargino mass and the higgs mass could be measured at the ilc .",
    "if the higgs boson is mostly doublet , it might be hard to disentangle the nmssm from the mssm .",
    "if it is singlet , mass relation between the nmssm higgs states would be different from what expected in the mssm .",
    "a mostly singlet higgs state could eventually be observable at the lhc with high luminosity  @xcite .    in the case of a mixed bino / higgsino lsp ,",
    "annihilation relies , as in the mssm , on s - channel @xmath6 exchange and t - channel neutralino / chargino exchange .",
    "if the singlino state is not heavy and decouples , _ ie _ @xmath23 not too small and @xmath24 not too large , the five neutralino states might be visible at the lhc / ilc .",
    "this would be a clear signature of the nmssm .",
    "finally , in the singlino lsp case , @xmath11 can not be too large .",
    "one therefore would expect visible higgsinos at the lhc .",
    "the singlino lsp would however appear at the end of the decay chain in any sparticle pair production process , which might complicate the detection task as it was the case at lep  @xcite .    as a concluding remark",
    ", one should mention that , if one assumes minimal flavour structure , @xmath248 might impose strong constraints on the nmssm parameter space , especially for large values of @xmath23 where the charged higgs mass , eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) , could be lighter than in the mssm",
    ". a complete study of the constraints coming from flavour physics should be the next step of the phenomenological study of the nmssm .",
