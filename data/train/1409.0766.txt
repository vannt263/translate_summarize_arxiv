    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a modification of a numerical scheme introduced in @xcite .",
    "a purpose of the modification is to prevent the number of particles which constitute a numerical solution from the exponential growth . to perform the task",
    "we approximate a nonlocal term , which appears on the right hand side of the model equation , using the finite range approximation method , see subsection [ fra ] for details . as shown in @xcite , a convergence of the scheme follows from the stability estimate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.11 ( ii ) ) .",
    "unfortunately , after the approximation procedure the assumptions of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.11 ) are not fulfilled anymore . from that reason we need to establish a relaxed version of the stability estimate and",
    "apply a new strategy in the proof of convergence of the scheme .",
    "the scheme under consideration follows a current trend which bases on a kinetic approach to population dynamics problems @xcite . within this approach",
    "a population of individuals is divided into groups , which are called cohorts . in other words ,",
    "a distribution of the population is approximated by a sum of dirac measures , each one of which represents the average state and the number of individuals within the corresponding cohort .",
    "such a method of approximation is vastly convenient for numerical studies , especially when it comes to compatibility of a model with an experimental data .",
    "indeed , a result of a measurement of a population is usually a number of individuals which state is within a specified range .",
    "a good example of such measurements are demographical studies which provide data about a size of age - cohorts .",
    "a broad group of methods originated from the kinetic theory are particle methods , which are designed to model a behavior of large groups of interacting particles or individuals . over the last decades",
    "they have been successfully applied to solve numerically many problems originated from physics as the euler equation in fluid mechanics @xcite and the vlasov equation in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "recently , the particle methods have been used in problems related to crowd dynamics and flow of pedestrians @xcite , models of a collective motion of large groups of agents @xcite and population dynamics @xcite . for more applications",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this paper we focus on the population dynamics and the following size structured population model    @xmath1    where @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 denote , respectively , time and the size of an individual . in general",
    ", the @xmath4 variable can describe other physiological states ( e.g. length or weight ) but for sake of simplicity we stick to the size variable .",
    "the measure @xmath5 is a distribution of individuals with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that an individual changes its size according to the following ode @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes a dynamics of the transformation , that is , a speed of the individual s growth .",
    "@xmath8 simply denotes a death rate , and the integral term describes a birth process . let us briefly explain the meaning of the right hand side of . for simplicity we assume for a moment that the @xmath9 function does not depend on time @xmath10 nor the population state @xmath5",
    ". then , for a fixed @xmath11 , @xmath12 describes a distribution ( with respect to @xmath4 ) of offsprings of an individual of the size @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the integral in describes a distribution of all new born individuals at each time moment . in the particular case where all new born individuals have the same size",
    "@xmath14 we set @xmath15 where @xmath16 is related to the probability that an individual of the size @xmath13 procreates . if holds , then the integral in transforms into a boundary condition and , as a consequence , can be reduced to the following classical renewal equation with the nonlocal boundary condition @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath5 with respect to the lebesgue measure at @xmath14 .",
    "the model describes a population which comes under processes of birth , death and development . a number of individuals in the population and its total biomass change in time , which clearly indicates a nonconservative character of the problem .",
    "we need to underline that the lack of conservativity is the main challenge associated with an application of the particle methods in the population dynamics .",
    "let us briefly recall that the most common mathematical framework for the kinetic theory is a space of probability measures equipped with a wasserstein distance .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath19-wasserstein distance @xmath20 between two radon measures @xmath5 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is infinite , which is the reason why natural distances for measures , like the wasserstein distances , can not be exploited in case of the nonconservative problems .",
    "indeed , let @xmath23 be finite radon measures on @xmath24 such that @xmath25 . then , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 6.1 ) @xmath26 and thus @xmath27 . therefore , a suitable framework which allows to establish well - posedness of the population dynamics models in the space of measures has to be developed at the first place .",
    "this has been recently achieved by replacing the wasserstein distance by the flat metric ( see section  [ mes ] for definitions and technical details ) .",
    "one of the first steps in that field has been made in @xcite , where existence , uniqueness and stability of solutions to in the space of finite , nonnegative radon measures equipped with the flat metric were proved . within the latter framework",
    "the first formal proof of convergence of a corresponding particle method for has been conducted in @xcite .",
    "the method is called the escalator boxcar train ( ebt ) , and although it was described for the first time in 80 s in @xcite , the proof of its convergence and the convergence rate @xcite is very recent .",
    "well posedness of a general size - structured population model in the space of measures was established in @xcite , and a numerical scheme based on the particle methods was developed in @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "an essential assumption is the particular form of the @xmath9 function , namely @xmath28 which means that the size of a child belongs to a set @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath13 is its parent size .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 corresponds to the special case of , and leads to the equation .",
    "another common example is a simple symmetric cell division model , which arises by setting @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath33 . the asymmetric case is obtained by setting @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 . as it has been already stated above , in the kinetic approach a solution",
    "is approximated by a sum of dirac measures at each discrete time moment . in case of the algorithm developed in @xcite",
    "dirac deltas represent cohorts , that is groups of individuals of a similar size .",
    "since a population comes under a process of births , at least one additional dirac measure is created at each time step of the algorithm . in case of the equation",
    "it is exactly one dirac measure , since all new born individuals have the same size .",
    "however , in case of the symmetric cell division model the number of dirac measures is doubled at each time step , which results in the exponential growth of particles . in order to prevent this phenomenon authors of @xcite",
    "developed a reconstruction procedure , which is in fact an approximation procedure .",
    "more precisely , if too many dirac deltas are created at a particular time step , they are simply approximated by a measure composed of a smaller number of them .",
    "nevertheless , the reconstruction has to be performed once per several time steps , which influences an accuracy of a numerical solution .",
    "our improvement of the scheme presented in @xcite bases on a new way of approximation .",
    "we postulate to approximate properly the @xmath9 function given by before performing any numerical simulation .",
    "namely , we approximate @xmath42 functions in by piecewise constant functions @xmath43 and , as a consequence , new dirac measures appear only at some fixed points of the ambient space .",
    "therefore , we run the scheme with a bit inaccurate coefficient , but it turns out that we do not need to perform any approximations nor reconstructions during its execution .",
    "the main problem of such approximation is that the new @xmath9 , that is @xmath44 does not fulfill the assumptions ( * ? ? ? * assumptions ( 3.1 ) - ( 3.4 ) ) providing well posedness of in the space of measures , which is caused by a fact that the piecewise constant functions are not a subclass of the lipschitz functions .",
    "fortunately , in the following paper we have overcome this obstacle by developing a relaxed version of the stability estimate , see subsection [ weak ] ( remark [ f_bar ] and theorem [ better_estimate ] ) . to accomplish the task we assumed that @xmath45 , which is not a restrictive limitation since the sublinearity of @xmath46 is biologically justified .",
    "let us mention just the basic examples , i.e. the age of a new born individual is always equal to zero , which is not greater that its parent s age , the sizes of daughter cells are smaller than the size of a mother cell before the mitosis process , a polymer chain is shorter after the division process . for more examples",

    "* section  3 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_opis ]",
    "we briefly describe the numerical scheme and the finite range approximation method .",
    "section  [ mes ] consists of some basic facts about the space of finite , nonnegative radon measures equipped with the flat metric .",
    "for the sake of completeness we also justify the choice of the latter space instead of the banach space @xmath47 . in section [ conv ] we provide convergence results . in section [ num ] we show results of numerical simulations for several test cases .",
    "in the following subsection we show how to construct the finite range approximation of a lipschitz continuous function .",
    "the lipschitz continuity of @xmath42 in is the assumption required for well - posedness of , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "application of the particle - based scheme developed in @xcite to that model results in the exponential growth of dirac measures approximating a solution .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that a child s size is exactly a half of its parent size .",
