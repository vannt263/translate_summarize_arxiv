    "having become extremely fashionable for their role as standardisable cosmological candles , type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are becoming the centre of a kind of scientific industry , with large programmes , both observational and theoretical , being launched to explore their properties , detect them at all redshifts , and understand the physical properties of the explosion and the mechanism that holds the key to their apparent predictability . since the main observational feature  the brightness ",
    "decline rate relation , is a one - parameter relation @xcite , and because most modelling work has been performed in 1d , it was typically assumed that the ejecta of sne ia are homogeneous , with little or no deviation from smooth density profiles and spherical symmetry .",
    "recently , however , some suggestion that these assumptions may not always be correct has come from polarisation measurements ( wang et  al .",
    "another , possibly related finding , is the detection of detached , high - velocity components in near - maximum spectra .",
    "the first suggestion of high - velocity components was made by @xcite , who noticed features that they interpreted as high - velocity ca  ii  and fe  ii  in the spectra of sn  1994d .",
    "they showed through spectral modelling that ca  ii  and fe  ii  are present at @xmath6 km  s@xmath2 , and reaching @xmath7 km  s@xmath2 , detached from the photospheric component ( @xmath8 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "further evidence came from sn  2000cx @xcite , which shows two strong and well separated components of the ca  ii  ir triplet at high velocities .",
    "@xcite analysed the spectra of this rather peculiar sn  ia , using a simple 3d spectrum synthesis model .",
    "they confirmed that detached ca  ii  is present at high velocities , this time @xmath9 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "they also noticed a corresponding broadening of the ca  ii  h&k doublet , which however did not show detached features .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed these findings , and additionally reported that high - velocity ti  ii  features are also present .",
    "detached features were also observed in sn  2001el @xcite at @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 , in sn  2003du at @xmath11 km  s@xmath2@xcite , and in sn  2004dt ( f. patat , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "in this paper we present and discuss evidence for a high - velocity component that is present in the spectra of another otherwise normal sn  ia , sn  1999ee @xcite .",
    "we argue in this case that not only ca  ii  and possibly fe  ii  show high - velocity features , but that a sudden change in the shape of the profile and the position of si  ii  6355 , the characterising line of sne  ia , is due to the presence ( and progressive thinning out ) of a high - velocity si component , which is identified for the first time in a sn  ia . since the presence of si has major implications for the properties of the explosion , we model the time - evolution of the spectra in order to identify the nature of the discontinuity giving rise to the high - velocity feature ( abundance , ionisation , density , interaction with circumstellar material ) , and to quantify the amount of high - velocity material , in particular si , required to reproduce the observations .",
    "optical and infrared spectra of sn  1999ee covering the period from -9d to + 42 days relative to @xmath0 maximum were presented by @xcite .",
    "sn  1999ee is a rather slow - decliner ( @xmath12 ) , but it does not show the spectroscopic peculiarities of sn  1991 t and similar sne .",
    "the spectral evolution and line identification are discussed by @xcite .    although the spectra of sn  1999ee look like those of a typical sn  ia , the ca  ii  ir triplet shows two small notches , separated by exactly the line separation of the two strongest components ( @xmath13 and 8662 ) .",
    "the narrow features are first visible on day 2 , and persist until day + 3 , during which time their position does not change significantly , indicating that they are formed in a layer that is detached above the photosphere , with central velocity @xmath14 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is similar to the sne  ia discussed above , although in sn  1999ee the narrow features are not clearly separated from the main broad absorption , which is of photospheric origin .",
    "if these features are correctly identified , their weakness in the two earlier spectra ( day 9 and 7 ) could result from the fact that the photosphere at those early epochs was located at velocities comparable to that of the narrow features .",
    "these would therefore blend almost completely with the broad component , resulting in a very broad ca  ii  ir triplet , as is indeed observed .",
    "the later disappearance of the narrow features , going from day + 3 to day + 8 , is then the combined consequence of the decreasing density in the high - velocity zone caused by expansion and of the inward motion of the photosphere , which becomes removed from the detached ca  ii  zone .",
    "fig . 1 shows how the ca  ii  ir triplet can be decomposed into three different components , one broad and two narrow .",
    "2 shows the time evolution of the central velocity of each component .",
    "the broad photospheric absorption drops rather smoothly from 20000 to 15000 km  s@xmath2 , but the two detached features are clearly measured at velocities between 24000 and 20000 km  s@xmath2  and then disappear .",
    "there is however another piece of observational evidence , not as clear perhaps as that of the ca  ii  ir triplet but certainly at least as rich in physical implications : the sudden change in the shape of the si  ii  6355  line between day 7 and day 2 . in the two earliest spectra",
    ", the line appears unusually blue ( with a central wavelength of @xmath15 , indicating a velocity of @xmath16 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "additionally , it displays a p - cygni profile which increases in strength towards the highest velocities , both in absorption and in emission , which is unusual for sne  ia lines .",
    "after this phase , the line moves suddenly to the red , and it looks like a perfectly normal sn line on day + 3 .",
    "the velocity evolution of the si  ii  line is also shown in fig.2 .",
    "after the sudden drop , the velocity of the line continues to decrease , but at a much lower rate .",
    "the coincidence in time of the appearing of the ca  ii  narrow features and the redward shift of the si  ii  line , and then of the disappearing of the ca  iifeatures and the return to normal of the si  ii  line suggests that these events may be correlated .",
    "the behaviour of the si  ii  line may also be due to the presence of high - velocity material , which makes the line appear at bluer wavelengths than usual at first .",
    "later , as this material becomes optically thin , the line recovers its typical profile .",
    "in order to locate accurately the regions responsible for the detached features and to describe realistically their physical properties , we modelled the sequence of spectra of sn  1999ee with our montecarlo code . as a first step",
    ", we tried to obtain reasonable matches to each spectrum across the observed wavelength range .",
    "we used a standard explosion model ( w7 , * ? ? ? * ) , and adjusted its 1d abundances to achieve a good match to the observations .",
    "we then modified the density and abundance distributions to reproduce the narrow ca  ii  features and the behaviour of the si  ii  line .",
    "we have modelled all 6 available spectra , starting from the first one , at day 9 , and until day + 8 .",
    "this covers the time when the spectral anomalies are present .",
    "we tried to reproduce the global properties of the spectra , neglecting the narrow ca  ii  features or the fast si  ii  line when present .",
    "this step was necessary in order to define quantities such as the luminosity and the photospheric velocity , which we can compare to the observed velocities plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the series of synthetic spectra is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the earliest spectra are sufficiently well reproduced , but then the synthetic spectra become rapidly worse . even at the earliest epochs , close inspection reveals defects caused by neglecting of the high - velocity components . in particular , looking at the first spectrum , the ca  ii  ir triplet and h&k doublet , and the si  ii  6355  line are significantly too red in the model , while other features such as the absorptions near 4250 and 4900 , which are dominated by fe  iii  lines at this epoch , are correctly reproduced .",
    "this behaviour repeats at other epochs , including those where the narrow components are present .",
    "based on the models above , we tried to reproduce the various spectral anomalies by modifying the distribution in velocity space of the elements involved . guided by the observed spectra , we introduced regions of increased abundances ( relative to w7 ) of si , ca , and fe at well defined velocities , trying to improve the synthetic spectra .",
    "the reason we experimented with the fe abundance , as well as those of si and ca , is that @xcite attribute a feature near 4700  seen in sn  1994d to high - velocity fe  ii  ( multiplet 48 ) absorption .",
    "a similar feature is observed in sn  1999ee , although the simple w7-based models seem to reproduce that region reasonably well , at least compared to the fe - dominated region near 4300 .",
    "starting from the first spectrum , we increased the abundance of si by factors between 5 and 20 at velocities between about 16000 and 22000 km  s@xmath2 , and that of ca by a factor of about 20 at velocities larger than about 20000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is however not possible to reproduce the narrow features near 4700  by simply increasing the fe abundance .",
    "this in fact generates both fe  iii  and fe  iilines at high velocity , but there are fe  iii - dominated absorptions , like that at 4250 , that do not show high - velocity components .",
    "therefore , we increased only the opacity of the fe  ii  in order to get a qualitative assessment of the possible role of high - velocity fe  ii .",
    "the opacity of fe  ii  was increased by factors of @xmath17 at @xmath18 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the results for the earliest spectrum are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the position of the si  ii  and ca  ii  lines is now reproduced much better , and the absorption near 4700  is now modelled as high - velocity fe  ii , demonstrating the plausibility of the hypothesis that high - velocity components are responsible .        if high - velocity features are to be taken seriously it should be possible to reproduce their effect on the spectra consistently at all epochs .",
    "therefore , we applied the enhancements to the abundances of si , ca , and the fe  ii  opacity in the velocity shells defined above , at all other epochs .",
    "the results are shown in fig.5 , while blow - ups of the si  ii  and ca  ii  ir regions are shown in figures 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , the adopted high - velocity distribution seems to give an excellent description of all observed peculiarities .",
    "the si  ii  line is still blue on day 7 ( @xmath19 ) , but in the next epoch , day 2 , it has shifted by at least 150to the red .",
    "this is due to the reduced opacity of the high - velocity si region , as the photosphere moves futher inwards .",
    "the line is then reproduced well at all later epochs . as for ca  ii , in the two earliest epochs the introduction of the high - abundance region leads only to a blueward shift of the absorption , since @xmath20 . at later epochs",
    ", however , the ca  ii  high - abundance region becomes detached .",
    "since the velocity separation of the high - abundance region from the photosphere is much greater than the velocity separation of the two strongest lines in the triplet , which is in turn larger than the velocity width of the high - velocity region , the two narrow absorptions are formed .",
    "they persist - at the correct wavelength - until the last epoch , when they disappear as their optical depth becomes too small . as we remarked earlier , ca  ii  h&k does not show distinctly detached features",
    ". however , the introduction of the high - velocity component leads to significant line optical depth at high velocity , causing the line to shift bluewards .",
    "this is the case for all the six spectra modelled .",
    "finally , the feature we tentatively attributed to fe  ii  is also reproduced very accurately in all except possibly the last epoch .",
    "the modified abundances imply that the regions involved are dominated by si ( @xmath21% by mass ) , and have a high abundance of ca ( @xmath22% by mass )",
    ". the fe abundance can be low ( @xmath23% by mass ) , but the ionisation degree of fe must favour fe  ii  over fe  iii . @xcite",
    "obtained rather similar values for sn  2001el .",
    "these abundances would imply significant burning of the outer layers of progenitor white dwarf ( wd ) .    burned material such as si may be produced at very high ( but not the highest ) velocities if the explosion mechanism was a delayed detonation ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , in the deflagration model , a thin he envelope ( @xmath24 ) could be located in the outermost part of the wd and be burned by a precursor shock during the explosion ; for a layer with densities as low as @xmath25 and @xmath26g@xmath27 , si - rich and ca - rich elements are synthesized , respectively @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility might be that the outermost shells have a higher abundance of these species , reflecting the metallicity of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "the required abundance ratios seem however to high for this scenario : even in the most metal - rich situation @xcite consider , the abundance of ca would be much less than the 10% by mass which is required in our models .",
    "another relatively unexplored possibility is that he shell flashes during the pre - sn evolution might produce elements such as mg , si , and ca .",
    "the he flash is stronger for slower accretion , becoming stronger as the white dwarf approaches the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "a different possibility to obtain high - velocity features is an overall increase in density above what is predicted by w7 .",
    "this may also help explaining the low ionisation degree of fe at high velocity .",
    "therefore , in the next set of models , we increased the density in a few shells at high velocity , leaving the original w7 abundances unchanged .    in these models , there is much less freedom to change parameters to obtain a good fit , since the test is to determine whether changing the density in a number of shells can lead to all high - velocity features being reproduced consistently , and to verify that models with this density change reproduce the observed spectra at all epochs .    since the high - velocity features appear at @xmath9 km  s@xmath2 , we increased the density of the corresponding shells with respect to w7 , without changing the abundances .",
    "we selected a set of density changes which allowed us to get a good match of the day 9 spectrum . in this model ,",
    "shown in fig .",
    "8 , the density was increased by a factor 1.5 at @xmath28 km  s@xmath2 , by a factor 8 at @xmath29 km  s@xmath2 , and by a factor 5 at @xmath30 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the extra mass contained in the ` bump ' is @xmath31 .",
    "this is a large increase of the mass at the highest velocities .",
    "model w7 , in fact , has only @xmath32 of material above 16750 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "increasing the density leads to much broader and bluer ca  ii  and si  ii  lines .",
    "the spectrum is very well reproduced , but the 4700  feature is not , although the ionisation of fe is indeed reduced at the velocities where the density is enhanced .",
    "the ca  ii  ir triplet becomes broad , but it is still narrower than the observed profile .",
    "we used this modified density distribution to compute spectra at all observed epochs .",
    "the results are shown in the sequence of fig.9 .",
    "the change in density is able to explain both the sudden redward shift of the si  ii  line and the appearance of the narrow components in the ca  ii  ir triplet .",
    "the fact that the timing of the change is correctly reproduced confirms that both the position and the amount of the modification are correctly estimated .",
    "a weak high - velocity fe  ii  absorption appears at 4700  in the spectra near maximum light .",
    "an increase in the fe abundance as well as in density seems to be necessary to reproduce the feature as fe  ii , so we can not confirm this identification .",
    "the quality of the synthetic spectra when compared to the observed ones suggests that an increase in density is a possibility that must be considered seriously .",
    "an overall variation of the density by this amount may occur if the explosion is not spherically symmetric , so that parts of the ejecta may be affected by burning differently from others .",
    "if these regions have sufficiently large angular scale , they may give rise to the observed spectral peculiarities .",
    "polarisation measures in sn  2001el @xcite may support this possibility .",
    "in the models in the previous section , the full width of the ca  ii  ir triplet in the earliest spactrum was not reproduced , even though the density was significantly enhanced .",
    "one possibility would be to add even more mass at the highest velocities",
    ". however , it is probably not reasonable to expect that the deviation from the spherically symmetric density structure can be much larger than what we have used . a different possibility to add",
    "mass at the highest velocities is the accumulation of circumstellar material .",
    "if the sn ejecta interact with a circumstellar environment , it is most likely that the csm composition is dominated by hydrogen .",
    "we tested different ways of adding hydrogen in the spectrum on day 9 , taking only thermal effects into account . in each test , the limiting value of the h mass was constrained by the strength of the synthetic h@xmath33 line .",
    "h@xmath33 is in fact not visible in the observed spectra .",
    "first , starting from the modified w7 density distribution that we derived in the previous section , we introduced h uniformly in the ejecta at @xmath34  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this was done by simultaneously reducing the abundances of all other elements . with this method we obtained an upper limit for the h mass of @xmath35 , corresponding to a h abundance of 4% h by mass , which is actually @xmath36% by number .",
    "although h@xmath33 is produced at this point , no changes are seen in either the ca  ii  or the si  ii  line profiles .",
    "then we assumed that only the outermost parts of the modified density structure contains hydrogen , 50% by mass , to simulate the piling up of csm material , and increased this h shell inwards .",
    "it is sufficient to introduce h above 25000 km  s@xmath2  to see a change in the synthetic ca  ii  ir triplet .",
    "although h@xmath33 is not seen , the presence of h has an indirect influence on the spectra , making the ca  ii  ir triplet significantly broader .",
    "the overall spectrum is shown in fig.10 , and a blow - up of the ca  ii  ir region is shown in fig .",
    "the total h mass in this model is only @xmath37 .     of hydrogen ( thin line ) . the model without h shown in fig.8",
    "is also shown here as a dotted line for comparison.,width=336 ]        this can be explained as follows : since the electron density is significantly increased when even a relatively small amount of h is added , recombination is favoured . since at the highest velocities",
    "ca is mostly doubly ionised , once h is introduced the fraction of ca  ii  increases ( by factors between 3 and 6 in the zones affected for the particular model we used ) .",
    "this leads to an increased strength of the ca  ii  lines and to the observed broader absorption .",
    "a second - order effect is also at play .",
    "a higher electron density means that photons have a higher probability of scattering off electrons .",
    "this results in a longer residence time of photons in the h - rich shells , and thus in turn in a higher probability that photons can interact with spectral lines .",
    "the effect of this is an increased line absorption - in all lines - at the highest velocities , since that is where the electron density effect is at play .",
    "since the ca  ii  lines are the strongest in the optical spectrum , they are also the most affected .",
    "electron scattering opacity is also responsible for the partial suppression of the peak near 4000   .    at later epochs ,",
    "the photosphere becomes further removed from the region where the hydrogen was added , and the spectra are therefore not affected : the results are similar to those of figure 9 .",
    "a necessary condition for hydrogen to affect the ca  ii  ir triplet is that the csm and the sn ejecta are well mixed , at least in a narrow region between 25000 and 28000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the abundance of ca in the csm ( taking solar as a typical value ) is in fact too small to give rise to the line opacity which is required to reproduce the observed line broadening , so the line must be due to ca from the sn ejecta .",
    "thorough mixing may not be easy to achieve , but what is required here affects only a very small mass @xmath38 , which may represent the interface between sn ejecta and csm . in our model , this region contains @xmath39% ca by mass .",
    "these calculations can not by themselves prove that the spectral peculiarities of sn  1999ee are  at least partially  due to an outer shell of h , especially since the h mass we used is smaller than the mass added by modifying the density profile ( @xcite use @xmath40 of h - rich material to broaden the ca  ii  ir triplet in sn  2003du , but those spectra do not show a broad si  ii  line , and in any case the effect thay predict on that line is the opposite , namely a narrowing of the line ) .",
    "however , our results suggest that the presence of h - rich material can have far - reaching effects on the spectra , even if the balmer lines are not themselves visible",
    ". an accurate study of the effect of h at high velocity will be the topic of future work .",
    "we have shown that a modification of the abundances or an increase of the mass at the highest ejecta velocities can explain the high velocity features observed in the spectrum of sn  1999ee .",
    "the former situation might result from the nuclear burning reaching the outermost layers of the white dwarf .",
    "the outer layers must contain mostly products of incomplete burning , in particular si , and some fe .",
    "a change of the density structure could be due to either a deviation , possibly not spherical , from the average properties of the explosion , or to the accumulation of csm material , or perhaps to both factors .",
    "if the bump in density is due to sn material , it should contain @xmath41 of material .",
    "this is a rather large change .",
    "however , it is quite possible that what we can reproduce as a ` density bump ' in one - dimensional models may actually be just a ` density blob ' in three dimensions .",
    "attempts have been made to model detached components as blobs in 3d @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , spectropolarimetric data are not available for sn  1999ee , and so the geometry can not be constrained , resulting in a degeneracy of solutions .",
    "qualitatively , in order to reproduce the observed spectral signatures , any blob must not be too small in size compared to the size of the photosphere . if one such blob is observed because it happens to lie along our line - of - sight , chances are that at least a few others are ejected as well . to support this",
    ", we note that two separate sets of high - velocity features were observed in sn  2000cx .",
    "it is a matter of probability to determine the optimal number and size of such blobs so that they are only observed in a few sne .",
    "unfortunately , the blobs become too thin to be visible as narrow emissions in the nebular spectra , where a head count would be much easier since radiative transport is not an issue .",
    "the question whether a global density enhancement or a blob are to be preferred could be resolved with more spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "both sn  2001el @xcite and sn  2004dt show polarisation at early epochs , which may support the blob hypothesis , as might the fact that most well - observed sne  ia near maximum do not show high - velocity features .",
    "these seem to be a much more common property of sne  ia at earlier epochs ( @xmath23 week before maximum or earlier , mazzali et  al .  , 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "perhaps , while broad early absorptions reaching high velocities may be the result of ejecta - csm interaction , narrow high - velocity absorptions near maximum could be the signature of blobs .",
    "if we assume that h - dominated csm material is piled up at the highest velocities , the enhanced electron density causes the ionisation degree to be lower in those regions .",
    "line broadening is then caused by the increased optical depth of the ca  ii  ir triplet .    in view of the mounting evidence that sne  ia",
    "can indeed interact with csm ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". it will be interesting to verify whether models where the only density enhancement is due to h - rich material can also reproduce the high - velocity features .",
