    "in the study of multipartite entanglement , symmetric multipartite states have drawn some attention recently @xcite .",
    "one reason for that is that they span a hilbert space whose dimension grows only linearly with the number of constituents , rather than exponentially for arbitrary multipartite states .",
    "they are therefore easier to deal with than generic states , and they provide a first step towards a more general understanding of multipartite entanglement .",
    "a pure symmetric @xmath0-qubit state can be written as a superposition of the dicke states familiar in quantum optics .",
    "a dicke state is a state of @xmath0 two - level atoms ( i.e.  qubits ) where a given number of excitations is symmetrically distributed over the @xmath0 constituents , so that the state is invariant under permutations of the qubits .",
    "such states have important technological potential for quantum storage , as the coupling constants of photons to atoms can effectively be increased by a factor @xmath1 when coupling the atoms symmetrically to the light field @xcite .",
    "another physical realization of dicke states is provided by angular momentum eigenstates , i.e.  spin-@xmath2 states arising as collective angular momentum states of @xmath3 physical spins-1/2 .",
    "the dicke states are formally equivalent to eigenstates @xmath4 of operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the usual angular momentum operators . a mixed symmetric state is then defined as a mixture of pure symmetric states ( note that this notion is distinct from that of symmetrized mixed state , which would be a tensor product of spin-@xmath8 density matrices symmetrized by summing over all permutations ) .    among the pure spin-@xmath2 states , spin coherent states ( also called su(2)-coherent states ) are the ones that come as close as possible to the ideal of a classical phase space point , in the sense that their quantum fluctuations for the angular moment components are as small as allowed by heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they keep this property under the dynamics induced by hamiltonians linear in the angular momentum components , corresponding physically for example to precession in a magnetic field . for a spin-@xmath2 coherent state ,",
    "the expectation value of the angular momentum operator in a specific direction @xmath9 is @xmath10 , a feature not true for a general pure spin-@xmath2 state . in this sense",
    "a spin-@xmath2 coherent state points in a well - defined direction ( note that all pure spin-1/2 states are coherent states , as they can be specified by a bloch vector on the unit sphere ) .",
    "if a spin-@xmath2 coherent state is interpreted as a symmetric @xmath0-fold tensor product of @xmath3 qubits , it can be expressed simply as the tensor product of @xmath0 identical spin-1/2 coherent states .",
    "therefore spin-@xmath2 coherent states coincide with symmetric separable pure states .",
    "classical spin-@xmath2 states are defined as statistical mixtures of spin coherent states @xcite . when expressed in the dicke basis ,",
    "they can be seen as separable symmetric @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "just as entanglement of a quantum state can be measured as the distance to the set of separable states , the quantumness ( or non - classicality ) of a spin-@xmath2 state can be measured as its distance to the set of classical states @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to investigate quantumness properties of a state from its spectral properties .",
    "there has been substantial research trying to figure out what entanglement properties can be derived from the spectrum of eigenvalues of the density matrix representing a composite system @xcite , and how to directly access the spectrum experimentally without having to reconstruct the full density matrix @xcite .",
    "measures of entanglement based on the spectrum have the immediate advantages of being relatively easy to compute , and to be invariant under unitary transformations , i.e.  to capture `` absolute separability '' @xcite .",
    "other well - known entanglement criteria are based on bounds of spin - correlations @xcite , which in turn exploit the positive - partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a tensorial representation for spin states .",
    "in this representation , a spin-@xmath2 density matrix is expanded as a sum over matrices of dimensions @xmath11 , and the expansion coefficients take the form of a tensor @xmath12 with @xmath3 indices .",
    "we showed in @xcite that the ppt criteria applied to symmetric multi - qubit states can be unified by means of a matrix @xmath13 , obtained from the tensor representation of the equivalent spin-@xmath2 state by splitting the set of indices in two subsets , and considering each set as coding for the row or column index of the @xmath13-matrix .",
    "positive partial transpose is then equivalent to positivity of the @xmath13-matrix , and correlation criteria for observables , such as spin - squeezing inequalities , can also be derived from positivity of @xmath13 @xcite .    in the light of these entanglement criteria based on spectral properties of the density matrix , or on positivity of the @xmath13-matrix constructed from the tensor @xmath14",
    ", one may wonder whether the spectrum of the tensor @xmath14 itself contains deeper information about the entanglement of the state .",
    "while the spectral theory of matrices is more than one century old , its extension to tensors is much more recent .",
    "the spectral theory of tensors has developed a lot in the past decade , and various tools have been proposed in the mathematical literature to tackle this problem ( see @xcite for a short review , and also section [ sectiontensoreigevalues ] below ) .",
    "but the relevance of the spectral theory of tensors for the separability ( or classicality ) problem has just recently attracted some attention in the quantum information community .",
    "for example in @xcite it was shown that for pure states the largest tensor eigenvalue is equal to the geometric measure of entanglement , i.e.  the maximal overlap of the state with a pure separable state .",
    "this entanglement measure is in fact essentially equivalent to finding the best rank - one approximation of the tensor .",
    "therefore , the largest tensor eigenvalue is directly related to the entanglement of a state . in this paper",
    "we will explore a new connection , which relates the _ smallest _ tensor eigenvalue to the entanglement of a pure or mixed state .",
    "this originates in the fact that the entanglement of a state is related to the positive - definiteness of a tensor , which in turn is linked to the sign of its smallest tensor eigenvalue .    in the present paper",
    "we report results of our investigations on the connection between spectral properties of the tensor of order @xmath15 associated with a spin-@xmath2 state , and the classicality of that state .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we recall some definitions of quantumness and the tensor representation , and show how the spectrum of the tensor is connected to the quantumness / classicality question . in section [ sectiontensoreigevalues ] we introduce tensor eigenvalues , and as an illustration calculate them explicitly for two examples . in section [ sectioncalculatingquantumness ]",
    "we introduce an efficient algorithm for calculating the distance from a state to the set of classical states .",
    "section [ sectionconnectiontensorquantum ] explores numerically the connection between smallest tensor eigenvalue and quantumness .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 qubits and we restrict the hilbert space to the subspace of symmetric states .",
    "we will describe them with the terminology of spin-@xmath2 states with @xmath3 .",
    "spin coherent states can be written as @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 spherical angles . here",
    "@xmath4 are the usual angular momentum basis vectors , i.e.  the simultaneous eigenvectors of the total angular momentum squared @xmath5 and its @xmath6 component , with eigenvalues @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ( @xmath21 ) . the spin coherent state @xmath22 can be seen as a spin-@xmath2 pointing in the direction @xmath23 .",
    "a spin-@xmath2 state @xmath24 is classical if and only if it can be expressed as a mixture of spin coherent states with positive weights @xcite , i.e.  if there exist spin coherent states @xmath25 such that @xmath26 we denote by @xmath27 the ensemble of such states . since a coherent spin state is formally exactly a pure symmetric separable state and vice versa @xcite , an entangled symmetric multi - qubit state is therefore a state which can not be written as a classical state as in eq .  .",
    "the amount of entanglement translates into a certain amount of non - classicality , or quantumness , defined as the ( hilbert - schmidt ) distance to the convex set of classical states , i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hilbert - schmidt norm @xcite .",
    "a spin-@xmath2 state has a quantumness larger than zero whenever the corresponding @xmath0-qubit state is entangled .",
    "it is known that the separable state closest to a symmetric state in terms of the bures distance is also symmetric @xcite .",
    "however for other distances this may not be the case .",
    "in particular , the hilbert - schmidt distance from an @xmath0-qubit symmetric state to the set of separable states is in general not equal to the quantumness of the corresponding state of a physical spin-@xmath2 system , as some separable non - symmetric states may lie closer .      in order to conveniently deal with expansions of quantum states over spin coherent states",
    ", we use a representation suited to this purpose , that has recently been introduced in @xcite .",
    "we express a spin-@xmath2 density matrix @xmath30 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath31 , @xmath32 , be the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath33 the @xmath34 identity matrix .",
    "we define the @xmath35 matrices @xmath36 ( with @xmath3 ) by @xmath37 with @xmath38 the projector onto the symmetric subspace of tensor products of @xmath0 spins-@xmath39 ( the subspace spanned by dicke states ) . the matrix @xmath30 can be expanded over the @xmath36 as @xmath40 ( summation over repeated indices is implicit ) , with real coefficients @xmath41 ( see @xcite for detail ) .",
    "the @xmath12 are invariant under permutation of the indices and enjoy the property that for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 normalization of the states @xmath30 in , @xmath46 , translates to @xmath47 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath12 can be seen as a symmetric order-@xmath0 tensor .",
    "we thus refer to as the tensor representation of @xmath30 .",
    "this representation is a generalization of the spin-@xmath39 bloch sphere representation @xmath48 with bloch vector @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( noting that @xmath51 ) .",
    "the tensor associated with a spin coherent state @xmath22 pointing in direction @xmath52 is simply given by @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the definition of classicality , eq .",
    ", can be reexpressed in terms of tensors .",
    "a state is classical if and only if there exist positive weights @xmath56 and unit vectors @xmath57 such that its tensor of coordinates @xmath14 can be written as @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "contracting such a tensor with an arbitrary real order-1 tensor @xmath60 gives @xmath61 if @xmath2 is an integer ( i.e.  if @xmath0 is even ) , the right - hand side is always positive since the weights @xmath56 are positive .",
    "therefore , any tensor having the form is such that its contraction with an arbitrary order-1 tensor is positive .",
    "this precisely corresponds to the definition of positive semi - definiteness of the tensor @xmath14 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for classicality of @xmath30 is thus that its associated tensor be positive semi - definite . in the case of a spin-1 system , where the tensor reduces to a matrix ,",
    "this is also a sufficient condition @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath62 it is not sufficient anymore , since there exist non - classical states which have a positive tensor representation , as will be discussed below .    before continuing the discussion on the relationship between classicality and tensor properties ,",
    "we introduce some elements of the spectral theory of tensors .",
    "let @xmath63 be the tensor representation of a spin-@xmath2 state .",
    "its entries are real and symmetric under any permutation of indices .",
    "tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such a real symmetric tensor are defined in @xcite .",
    "different definitions have been introduced .",
    "for instance , for a tensor with @xmath0 indices , each ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( in our case @xmath66 ) , z - eigenvalues , which we will use in this paper , are the real numbers @xmath67 such that there exists a real vector @xmath68 with @xmath69 components verifying @xmath70}=\\lambda v\\\\ v^t v=1 , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71}$ ] denotes the tensor of order @xmath72 given by @xmath73}\\right)_{\\mu_{k+1}\\dots\\mu_n}=a_{\\mu_1 \\mu_2 \\ldots \\mu_n}v_{\\mu_1 } v_{\\mu_2 } \\cdots v_{\\mu_{k}},\\ ] ] and @xmath74 is the transpose of @xmath68 .",
    "the different definitions of tensor eigenvalues can be written as special cases of the b - eigenvalues , which are defined @xcite as @xmath75}=\\lambda b v^{[m-1 ] } , \\quad bv^{[m]}=1,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is a real symmetric order-@xmath20 tensor and @xmath77 . if @xmath76 is chosen as the identity matrix ( i.e.  @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 are restricted to real values , then the solutions @xmath67 are the z - eigenvalues defined in eq .  .",
    "if @xmath80 and @xmath76 is the identity tensor ( i.e.  @xmath81 if all @xmath42 are identical and @xmath82 otherwise ) , so that @xmath83}=x_0^{m}+x_1^{m}+\\cdots x_n^{m}$ ] , real solutions to are called h - eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "another type are the d - eigenvalues , which have recently found application in magnetic resonance imaging studies of the diffusion kurtosis coefficients of water molecules @xcite .",
    "they can be written as real b - eigenvalues if @xmath78 and there exist a symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath84 with @xmath85}=x^t d x$ ] , such that there exists a real vector @xmath68 with @xmath86}=\\lambda d v , \\quad v^t dv=1.\\ ] ] for a more detailed overview on the topic of tensor eigenvalues see @xcite .",
    "it is possible , via resultant theory , to generalize the usual matrix notions of determinant and of characteristic polynomial , and to obtain eigenvalues as the ( generally complex ) roots of the characteristic polynomial associated with the tensor @xcite .",
    "note however that the z ( or h)-eigenvalues defined above are real numbers .",
    "if this restriction to reals is lifted , many properties of ordinary matrix eigenvalues are recovered ( for instance the number of eigenvalues , or their total sum , is known ) .",
    "nevertheless , the restriction to real numbers is justified if one wants to generalize the property that a matrix is positive semi - definite if and only if its eigenvalues are positive .",
    "indeed , both z and h - eigenvalues share the property that a tensor is positive semi - definite if and only if all z or h - eigenvalues are positive , which makes them the most natural suitable generalization of matrix eigenvalues .",
    "but the h - eigenvalues are not invariant under rotation , while z - eigenvalues are , as will be shown below .",
    "since spin coherent states behave in a very simple way under rotation , we will concentrate on the z - eigenvalues defined by eq .  , which we will refer to , from now on , as `` tensor eigenvalues '' .",
    "note that we also tested our methods on the h - eigenvalues , and they gave comparable results to the ones presented in section [ sectionconnectiontensorquantum ] .",
    "tensor eigenvalues do not share all the properties of the familiar matrix eigenvalues .",
    "for example it is in general not true that the tensor eigenvalues of a diagonal tensor are just its diagonal elements .",
    "however , the tensor eigenvalues are invariant under rotations and the corresponding eigenvectors are just the rotated eigenvectors ( theorem 7 .  of @xcite ) . in order to familiarize the reader with the tensor notation ,",
    "let us show this explicitly .",
    "take @xmath68 as a tensor eigenvector of the real symmetric tensor @xmath14 with tensor eigenvalue @xmath67 , i.e.  fulfilling .",
    "given a real orthogonal matrix @xmath87 and the rotated objects marked with primes , then @xmath88}= \\prod_{i=1}^n r_{\\mu_i,\\nu_i}a_{\\nu_1 \\dots \\nu_n } \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1 } r_{\\mu_j,\\eta_j } v_{\\eta_j}\\\\ & = \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1 } ( r^tr)_{\\nu_j,\\eta_j } r_{\\mu_n,\\nu_n } a_{\\nu_1 \\dots \\nu_n } v_{\\eta_j } \\\\ & = r_{\\mu_n,\\nu_n }   a_{\\nu_1 \\dots",

    "this feature is particularity important in our case , because a rotated spin-@xmath2 quantum state @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the spin-@xmath2 representation of a rotation , has a tensor representation given by @xmath91 with @xmath87 the @xmath92 matrix whose @xmath93 lower - right block is the orthogonal matrix associated with the rotation of axis @xmath52 and angle @xmath94 , and @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "determining tensor eigenvalues is usually a computationally hard problem .",
    "it can be expressed in the following way : the tensor eigenvalues defined by are the critical points of the polynomial @xmath96}-\\lambda\\left(||{\\bf x}||_2^n-1\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath97 indeed , critical points of @xmath98 are defined by @xmath99 ; the conditions @xmath100 are equivalent to the first line in eq .",
    ", as can easily be seen from the fact that if @xmath14 is a symmetric tensor one has @xmath101}=n\\left(a x^{[n-1]}\\right)_{\\nu}\\ ] ] and @xmath102 condition @xmath103 gives the second line in eq .  .",
    "thus the tensor eigenvalues can be obtained as the local extrema of @xmath104}$ ] over the 3-sphere @xmath105 .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "a real symmetric tensor is positive semi - definite , i.e.  @xmath104}\\geq 0 $ ] for all @xmath106 , if and only if all of its tensor eigenvalues are non - negative .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to calculate the smallest tensor eigenvalue to determine the positivity of the tensor . in particular",
    ", a tensor can be positive definite only if the tensor has an even number of indices : otherwise each tensor eigenpair @xmath107 has also a negative counterpart @xmath108 , as can be seen by the definition .",
    "numerically , the smallest tensor eigenvalue is obtained by computing the global minimum of @xmath104}$ ] over the 3-sphere .",
    "such a problem can be tackled numerically using methods described e.g.  in @xcite . in the next section",
    "we show examples of quantum states where tensor eigenvalues can be derived analytically .        for a spin-@xmath2 coherent state with bloch vector",
    "@xmath109 the tensor representation @xmath110 takes the simple form . in order to deduce all",
    "tensor eigenvalues @xmath67 and eigenvectors @xmath111 , we have to solve eq .  , which then reads @xmath112 }   & = & ( n_{\\mu_1}x_{\\mu_1})\\ldots \\nonumber ( n_{\\mu_{n-1}}x_{\\mu_{n-1}})n_{\\mu_{n}}\\\\   = \\lambda x_{\\mu_{n } } , \\quad ||{\\bf x}||_2&=&1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the tensor eigenvalues are invariant under rotation , we can , without loss of generality , rotate @xmath113 to the form @xmath114",
    ". this simplifies eq .   to @xmath115 from the third and fourth line it is visible that there are two solutions @xmath116 or @xmath117 . if @xmath116 , then @xmath118 and @xmath119 are arbitrary under the restriction @xmath120 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath121 for @xmath0 even , or @xmath122 for @xmath0 odd , and @xmath123 .",
    "thus the tensor eigenvalues of a tensor associated with a coherent spin-@xmath2 state are @xmath124 and @xmath64 . for integer",
    "@xmath2 we recover the fact that the tensor is positive , as it should since a spin coherent state is classical .      for the maximally mixed state @xmath125 ,",
    "the tensor representation is given by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the floor function @xcite .",
    "@xmath128 constrained by @xmath105 , eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "if @xmath2 is an integer , @xmath131 is a sum of positive terms and thus larger than zero .",
    "the tensor eigenvalues are local extrema of @xmath132 on the 3-sphere , or equivalently the local extrema of @xmath131 over the interval @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "the local extrema on the border of the interval , @xmath134 , give a tensor eigenvalue @xmath135 . because @xmath131 is symmetric",
    "there is a local extremum at @xmath136 , which gives the tensor eigenvalue @xmath137 . for @xmath138",
    "the function @xmath131 has exactly one extremum in the interval @xmath1390,1[$ ] , which gives a third tensor eigenvalue ( see appendix for a proof ) .",
    "thus for integer @xmath2 the tensor associated with the maximally mixed state has three tensor eigenvalues and the minimal tensor eigenvalue is @xmath140 .    for half integer @xmath2",
    "there are two tensor eigenvalues on the border of the interval which give @xmath141 . for @xmath142",
    "the function @xmath131 has a maximum in @xmath1430,1 [ $ ] ( see appendix for a proof ) , and since @xmath131 is antisymmetric also a corresponding minimum in @xmath143 - 1,0 [ $ ] .",
    "thus the tensor has four tensor eigenvalues .",
    "our goal is to compare quantumness of a spin-@xmath2 state as measured by the distance with spectral properties of the tensor associated with it . in order to compute quantumness efficiently ,",
    "the calculation can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem , by fixing a large number of spin coherent states in the sum and optimizing over the weights @xmath56 .",
    "this is detailed in section [ section quadratic algorithm ] . however",
    ", this does not guarantee to find the global minimum , as the decompositions of the closest classical states may involve spin coherent states which do not belong to the large set chosen . to improve the accuracy of the estimation we will use the outcome of the quadratic optimization as starting point in a linear optimization routine detailed in section [ seclinear ] .",

    "note that the entries of @xmath159 are given by @xmath160^{2j } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and that @xmath161    the optimization can be performed with the powerful numerical algorithms available , e.g.  the interior - point - convex method @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the size of the quadratic optimization problem , given by the vector @xmath162 and the matrix @xmath163 , does not depend on the spin size @xmath2 , but only on the number of random spin coherent states used .",
    "however , for very large values of @xmath2 @xmath164 even the one - time calculation of @xmath162 and @xmath165 can become computationally expensive .    to improve the outcome it is advantageous to iterate the optimization several times with different sets of spin coherent states .",
    "in the subsequent iterations , only the spin coherent states with large weights are kept and additional nearby states are added to the set .",
    "the set is then completed with random spin coherent states .",
    "after typically @xmath166 iterations , we take the best outcome as an approximation of the global minimum of .",
    "this also provides an approximation @xmath167 for the true closest classical state @xmath24 . by construction",
    ", @xmath167 is a classical state , so that quantumness is necessarily overestimated , since the distance to any classical state gives an upper bound on the quantumness . to further improve its determination , a linear optimization",
    "can then be performed as follows .",
    "suppose we have obtained an approximation @xmath167 for the closest classical state @xmath24 by running the quadratic algorithm above .",
    "if the classical state @xmath167 is not exactly on the border of the classical domain , it is possible to move it in the direction of the state @xmath30 while remaining in the classical domain .",
    "this yields a better approximation of the global minimum , and thus of the actual quantumness .",
    "this step can be formulated as a linear optimization problem by parametrizing the states inbetween the classical state @xmath168 and @xmath30 , as @xmath169 with @xmath170 $ ] .",
    "now the optimization task is to maximize @xmath171 under the constraint that @xmath172 stays classical , which can be formulated in the form of linear constraints as @xmath173 and the optimization is now performed on @xmath56 and @xmath171 with @xmath174 , and @xmath175 while @xmath155 are ( a large number of ) fixed spin coherent states .",
    "similarly as in section [ section quadratic algorithm ] , this optimization problem can be written as @xmath176 where the @xmath148-th columns of @xmath147 are given by the real and imaginary parts of entries of @xmath149 , and @xmath177 are the real and imaginary parts of entries of the density matrices @xmath30 and @xmath168 . since",
    "a linear optimization is much faster than a quadratic optimization , the set of random spin coherent states used to fix the linear constraints can be much larger , e.g.  usually by two orders of magnitude , and still have a runtime comparable to the quadratic optimization . however , in contrast to the quadratic algorithm the computational demands depend on the spin size @xmath2 , since the number of rows in @xmath147 scales as @xmath178 . in the results presented in the next section this linear optimization step improves the quadratic results usually by an amount smaller than @xmath179 . while this improvement is usually negligible , it becomes relevant to estimate quantumness of states close to the boundary of classical states , and to properly identify classical states .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a classical state must have a positive semi - definite tensor representation . therefore ,",
    "if its smallest tensor eigenvalue @xmath180 is negative the state is detected as non - classical , i.e.  entangled . to test the rigour of the detection we generated states just on the border of the set of classical states",
    "this was done by taking random states drawn from the hilbert - schmidt ensemble of matrices @xmath181 , with @xmath182 a complex matrix with independent gaussian entries ( see @xcite for detail ) , and calculating its closest classical state according to the method presented in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogramzeigonccs ] the distribution of the smallest eigenvalues is shown for this ensemble of closest classical states .",
    "if positivity of @xmath14 were a sufficient condition for classicality , then @xmath180 would be equal to 0 for all closest classical states .",
    "numerically , we rather get values centered around @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 for @xmath186 , respectively .    thus , states lying at the border of classical states , with zero quantumness , have a smallest tensor eigenvalue significantly larger than zero , which indicates that for the values of @xmath2 considered this method of entanglement detection is not well suited for too weakly entangled states .",
    "for random states on the border of the classical domain , with @xmath187 ( black , dots ) , @xmath188 ( red , crosses ) and @xmath189 ( blue , solid ) .",
    "these states are the closest classical states to random mixed states and were determined with the quadratic and linear algorithm described in section [ sectioncalculatingquantumness].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    conversely , one may wonder what is the typical quantumness of states which have a vanishing smallest tensor eigenvalue . to investigate this we generated states such that @xmath190 , by mixing a random initial state @xmath30 with the maximally mixed state @xmath191 ( with @xmath192 the identity matrix ) , and decreasing @xmath193 until the smallest tensor eigenvalue was close to zero .",
    "the results for these states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin1 - 3histogram ] .",
