    "galaxy clusters are the largest and most massive virialized objects in the universe , which make them ideal probes of the large scale structure of the universe and , hence , of cosmological parameters that govern the growth of structures ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in order to obtain robust estimates of these parameters , using x - ray techniques , one requires precise knowledge about the evolution of galaxy clusters with redshift and the thermodynamical properties of intracluster medium ( icm ) . in the simplest case , where one considers pure gravitational collapse ,",
    "cluster scaling relations are expected to follow self - similarity @xcite .",
    "x - ray scaling relations have been widely used to test the strength of correlations between cluster properties and to probe the extent of self - similarity of clusters @xcite .",
    "these observations show departure from self - similarity ; for example , the luminosity - temperature ( @xmath6 ) relation for self - similar models predict a shallower slope ( @xmath7 ) than observed ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "similarly , sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) scaling relations also show similar departure @xcite .",
    "such departures point towards the importance of complex non - gravitational processes over and above the shock heating of the icm .",
    "the first idea aimed at explaining departure from self - similar scaling relations is that of _ preheating _ , first proposed by @xcite and later extended by others @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the cluster forms from an already preheated and enriched gas due to feedback processes ( such as galactic winds or agn ) heating up the surrounding gas at high redshifts .",
    "preheating models require constant entropy level of @xmath1 kev @xmath2 in order to explain the break in the self - similarity scaling relations @xcite . in terms of icm energetics ,",
    "this typically translates into feedback energy of @xmath9 kev per particle @xcite .",
    "however , there is an ambiguity in defining preheating energy / particle since it depends on the density at which gas is heated ( less dense gas requires smaller energy to raise it to a particular entropic state ) .",
    "therefore , preheating is best expressed in terms of entropy .",
    "although , early preheating models could describe the scaling relations in clusters , it had drawbacks with regard to details .",
    "for example , these models predicted isentropic cores particularly in the low mass clusters @xcite and an excess of entropy in the outskirts of the clusters @xcite which are not consistent with observations .",
    "the idea of preheating has endured and has found resurgence in recent times ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite suggested time dependent entropy injection due to tev blazars which provide uniform heat at @xmath10 peaking near @xmath11 and subsequent formation of cc ( ncc ) clusters by early forming groups ( late forming groups ) while @xcite explored preventative scenario of feedback in which the circum - halo medium is heated to finite entropy .",
    "in contrast to preheating , there can also be _ in situ _ effects such as injection of energy feedback from agn , radiative cooling , supernovae and star formation , influencing the thermal structure of icm @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence that agn feedback mechanism provides a major source of heating for the icm @xcite in the cluster cores .",
    "outside cluster cores , however , the estimates of entropy floor and feedback energy ( particularly in massive clusters ) are more reflective of preheating of gas since ( i ) the effect of central sources is unlikely to be significant and ( ii ) the loss of energy through radiation is negligible .",
    "it is worth noting that irrespective of the nature of feedback , the thermodynamic history of the icm is fully encoded in the entropy of the icm .",
    "the icm entropy profile is defined as constant ] @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "non - radiative amr / sph simulations , which encodes only gravitational / shock heating , predict entropy profiles of the form @xmath14 @xcite . apart from slightly larger normalization",
    ", it has been found that there is significantly higher ( flatter ) core entropy in amr case as a result of the hydrodynamical processes that are resolved in the code ( e.g. shocks and mixing motions ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "observations find deviations from the predicted entropy profile at small radii @xcite as well as large radii @xcite .",
    "a meaningful comparison of recent observations with theoretically expected entropy profiles can thus be used to determine the nature and degree of feedback .",
    "this idea was developed and used recently by @xcite who estimated the non - gravitational energy deposition profile in the cluster cores .",
    "they compared benchmark non - radiative amr / sph entropy profiles @xcite with observed entropy profiles for the _ rexcess _ sample of 31 clusters @xcite and found the excess mean energy per particle to be @xmath15 kev up to @xmath5 .",
    "further , they showed that the excess energy is strongly correlated with agn feedback in cluster cores @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we extend their work by going beyond @xmath5 and estimate entropy floor and feedback energetics at large cluster radii .",
