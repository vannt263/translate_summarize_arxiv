    "it has long been recognized that coalescences of binary systems of two black holes could be an important source of gravitational waves @xcite , both for the ground based interferometric detectors ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite currently under construction , and also for the possible future space - based interferometer lisa @xcite .",
    "the orbits of binary black holes ( bbhs ) gradually decay from energy and angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation .",
    "eventually , the holes coalesce to form a final black hole . for gravitational radiation reaction to successfully drive the binary to merge in less than a hubble time",
    ", the initial orbital period must be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total mass of the binary ; thus the critical orbital period is of order days for solar mass black holes , and of order years to hundreds of years for supermassive black holes ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the process of coalescence can be divided up into three more or less distinct phases :    * an adiabatic _ inspiral _ , during which the gravitational radiation reaction timescale is much longer than the orbital period .",
    "the inspiral ends when the binary orbit becomes relativistically dynamically unstable at an orbital separation of @xmath27 ( in units where @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waves from the inspiral carry encoded within them the masses and spins of the two black holes , some of the orbital elements of the binary and the distance to the binary @xcite .",
    "* towards the end of the inspiral , the black holes encounter the dynamical instability and make a gradual transition from a radiation - reaction driven inspiral to a freely - falling plunge @xcite , after which , even if the radiation reaction could be turned off , the black holes would still merge .",
    "we will call the subsequent plunge and violent collision the _ merger _ phase .",
    "gravitational waves from the merger could be rich with information about the dynamics of relativistic gravity in a highly nonlinear , highly dynamic regime about which we have a poor theoretical understanding today .",
    "* as the final black hole settles down to a stationary kerr state , the nonlinear dynamics of the merger gradually become more and more describable as oscillations of this final black hole s",
    "quasinormal modes @xcite .",
    "the corresponding emitted gravitational waves consist of a superposition of exponentially damped sinusoids .",
    "we will call the phase of the coalescence for which the emitted gravitational - wave signal is dominated by the strongest @xmath29 quasinormal mode signal the _ ringdown _ phase .",
    "the waves from the ringdown carry information about the mass and spin of the final black hole @xcite .",
    "( note that , for want of a better terminology , throughout this paper we consistently use _ coalescence _ to refer to the entire process of inspiral , merger and ringdown , and reserve the word merger for the phase intermediate between inspiral and ringdown . )    in this paper we focus primarily on bbhs in which the masses of the two black holes are approximately the same , although we do also consider sources where one bh is much smaller than the other .",
    "we consider three different classes of bbhs :    \\(i ) _ solar mass _ black hole binaries , _",
    "i.e. _ , binaries that are formed from massive main - sequence progenitor binary stellar systems .",
    "such bbhs are expected to have total masses in the range @xmath30 , but not much larger than this .",
    "the rate of coalescence of solar - mass bbhs in the universe is not very well known .",
    "however , theory suggests that most of the bbh progenitor systems may not disrupt during the stellar collapses that produce the black holes , so that their coalescence rate could be about the same as the birth rate for their progenitors , about @xmath31 years in our galaxy , or several per year within a distance of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "note that this coalescence rate is roughly the same as the expected event rate for what has traditionally been regarded as the most promising source for ground based interferometers , coalescences of neutron star ",
    "neutron star ( ns - ns ) binaries @xcite",
    ". the expected rate of ns - ns coalescences is more firmly known , however , since it is based on extrapolations from detected progenitor ns - ns systems @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ intermediate mass _ black hole binaries , with total masses in the range @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast to the cases of solar mass black holes and supermassive black holes ( discussed below ) , there is little direct observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this mass range . although there have been suggestions that the globular cluster m15 harbors a black hole of mass @xmath34 @xcite , theoretical modeling combined with the most recent hst observations neither confirm nor rule out this possibility @xcite . despite the lack of observational evidence , it is plausible that black holes in this mass range are formed in the cores of globular clusters , or in galactic nuclei in the process of formation of a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "simulations by quinlan and shapiro suggest that black holes with @xmath35 could be formed in the evolution of dense stellar clusters of main sequence stars in galactic nuclei @xcite , and that coalescences of binaries of such black holes could be possible en route to the formation of a supermassive black hole .",
    "we are prompted to consider these intermediate mass bbhs by the following consideration : even if the coalescence rate of intermediate mass bbhs is @xmath36 that of ns - ns binaries ( which is thought to be @xmath37 in our galaxy as discussed above ) , these sources would still be seen more often than ns - ns binaries by ligo s initial and advanced interferometers , and thus could be the first detected type of source .",

    "one of the main scientific goals of the lisa project is to detect and monitor various processes involving smbhs , such as the capture of compact stars @xcite , and their formation @xcite . in particular , the coalescences of smbh binaries that are formed in galaxy mergers , in which the individual smbhs are driven together by dynamical friction and gas accretion until gravitational radiation reaction takes over @xcite ,",
    "have often been suggested as a promising source for space - based interferometers @xcite .",
    "such coalescences would be detectable throughout the observable universe with large signal to noise ratios @xcite .",
    "there is also observational evidence for smbh binaries : wiggles in the radio jet of qso 1928 + 738 have been attributed to the orbital motion of a smbh binary @xcite , as have time variations in quasar luminosities @xcite and in emission line redshifts @xcite .",
    "the overall event rate is uncertain , but could be large ( @xmath41 ) , especially if the hierarchical scenario for structure formation is correct @xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical understanding and predictions of the gravitational waveforms @xmath42 and @xmath43 produced in bbh coalescences will facilitate both the detection of the gravitational - wave signal , and the extraction of its useful information . in situations where a complete family of theoretical template waveforms is available",
    ", it will be possible to use the procedure of wiener optimal filtering to search the interferometer data streams and to detect the gravitational - wave signal @xcite .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) can be larger than those obtainable without theoretical templates by a substantial factor ; see sec .",
    "[ derivesnrformulagen ] .",
    "thus , while it is possible to detect the various phases of bbh coalescences without theoretical templates , such templates can greatly increase the effective range of the interferometers and the event detection rate .",
    "( accurate theoretical templates are also essential for extracting the maximum amount of information from detected signals @xcite . )",
    "such theoretical template waveforms are available for the inspiral and ringdown phases of the coalescence , but not yet for the merger phase , as we now discuss .    for the inspiral phase of the coalescence",
    ", the gravitational waves and orbital evolution can be described reasonably well using the post - newtonian approximation to general relativity . to date",
    ", inspiral waveforms have been calculated up to post-2.5-newtonian order @xcite , and the prospects look good for obtaining waveforms up to post-3.5-newtonian order @xcite .",
    "post - newtonian templates will be fairly accurate over most of the inspiral , the most important error being a cumulative phase lag @xcite .",
    "this cumulative phase lag will not be important for searches for inspiral waves ; template phasing error will be largely compensated for by systematic errors in best - fit values of the binary s parameters , and the signals will still be found @xcite .",
    "by contrast , template inaccuracies will be significant when one attempts to extract from the data the binary s parameters .",
    "in particular , post - newtonian templates errors start to become very significant around an orbital separation of @xmath44 @xcite , well before the end of the inspiral at the dynamical orbital instability ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "templates for the phase of the inspiral between roughly @xmath45 and @xmath46 will most likely have to be calculated using methods other than the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "moreover , the methods of full blown numerical relativity can not be applied to this `` intermediate binary black hole '' ( ibbh ) phase , since the total time taken to evolve from @xmath45 to @xmath46 is about @xmath47 , too long for supercomputer simulations to even contemplate evolving .",
    "alternative analytic and numerical methods for calculating gravitational waveforms from the ibbh portion of bbh inspirals , based on the adiabatic approximation , are under development @xcite ; it is likely that such alternative methods will be successfully developed and implemented before the gravitational - wave detectors begin their measurements @xcite .",
    "waveforms from the dynamic , complicated merger phase of the coalescence can only be obtained from numerical relativity . unlike mergers of neutron star binaries ,",
    "bbh mergers are particularly clean in the sense that there is no microphysics or hydrodynamics to complicate simulations of the evolution , and external perturbations are negligible : the entire merger can be described as a solution to the vacuum einstein equation @xcite .",
    "finding that solution is not a particularly easy task : a major computational effort to evolve the vacuum einstein equation for bbh mergers using massive computational resources is currently underway , funded by the national science foundation s grand challenge program @xcite .",
    "the ringdown phase of the coalescence can be accurately described using perturbation theory on the kerr spacetime background @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waveforms from this phase are well understood , being just exponentially damped sinusoids .",
    "thus , wiener optimal filtering is feasible for searches for ringdown waves .",
    "the principal purpose of this paper is to estimate , in more detail than has been done previously , the prospects for measuring gravitational waves from the three different phases of coalescence events ( inspiral , merger and ringdown ) , for various different detectors , and for a wide range of bbh masses .",
    "we estimate in each case the distances to which the different types of source can be seen by calculating expected snrs . in particular , we determine for each bbh mass and each detector whether a coalescence event is most effectively detected by searching for the inspiral portion of the signal , or the merger portion , or the ringdown portion .",
    "we also determine how much the availability of theoretical template waveforms for the merger phase could increase the event detection rate .",

    "[ nonlinear ] an alternative search method , motivated by bayesian analyses and incorporating nonlinear filtering , which performs much better than band - pass filtering and in some cases almost as well as matched filtering .",

    "the actual snr obtained when searching for a real , general - relativistic inspiral waveform using post - newtonian templates should deviate from this by only a few tens of percent @xcite .",
    "we terminate the spectrum at the frequency @xmath68 which is ( roughly ) the frequency of quadrupole waves emitted at the orbital dynamical instability at @xmath69 @xcite . for lisa ,",
    "we assume that the measurement process lasts at most one year , and choose the frequency at which the inspiral spectrum starts accordingly .    :",
    "the spectrum that we use [ eq .  ( [ dedfqnr ] ) ] is determined ( up to its overall amplitude ) by the characteristics of the @xmath29 quasi - normal ringing ( qnr ) mode of the final kerr black hole .",
    "this mode is the most slowly damped of all qnr modes , so we expect it to dominate the last stages of the gravitational - wave emission .",
    "the qnr spectrum depends on three parameters : the quasi - normal modes frequency @xmath70 and damping time @xmath71 , and the overall amplitude of the quasinormal mode signal .",
    "equivalently , the three parameters can be taken to be the mass @xmath25 and dimensionless spin parameter @xmath72 of the final black hole ( which determine @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and the total amount of energy radiated in the ringdown ( which determines the overall amplitude ) .",

    "it seems likely that in many coalescences the spin of the final black hole will be close to maximal , since the total angular momentum of the binary at the end of the inspiral is @xmath76 when the individual black holes are non - spinning @xcite , and the individual black hole spins can add to this .",
    "exactly how close to maximally spinning the final black hole will be is a matter that probably will not be decided until supercomputer simulations  or observations  settle the issue . in any case , the ringdown snr values that we obtain depend only weakly on our assumed value of @xmath72 [ _ cf_.  eq .  ( [ qnrsnrii ] ) ] , for fixed total energy radiated in the ringdown .",
    "the overall amplitude of the ringdown signal depends upon one s delineation of where `` merger '' ends and `` ringdown '' begins , which is somewhat arbitrary . for equal - mass bbhs , we assume a value of the overall amplitude that corresponds to a total radiated energy in the ringdown of @xmath77a radiation efficiency of @xmath78 .",
    "this number is based on a back - of - the - envelope , quadrupole - formula - based estimate of the qnr mode s amplitude when the distortion of the horizon of the black hole is of order unity ( _ cf_.  sec .",
    "[ ringdownphase ] ) .",
    "although this radiation efficiency seems rather high , there have been numerical simulations of the evolution of distorted , spinning black holes in which the ringdown waves carry away @xmath79 of the black hole s total mass energy @xcite .    for non equal - mass black holes , we assume that the total energy radiated is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the reduced mass of the binary .",
    "this function gives the correct results for the equal - mass case and also gives the correct scaling law in the regime @xmath83 ; for general mass ratios the scaling law is probably a good approximation .    :",
    "realistic merger energy spectra will vary substantially from event to event ( depending on the initial spins of the inspiraling black holes ) .",
    "currently , we have very little concrete information about such spectra , pending supercomputer simulations of bbh mergers . in sec .  [ mergerphase ]",
    "we describe various circumstantial pieces of evidence , culled from the literature , relevant to merger spectrum .",
    "based on that evidence , we adopt the following crude model for equal - mass bbhs : we assume a flat spectrum @xmath84 extending from the frequency @xmath85 of quadrupole waves at the end of inspiral to the quasinormal ringing frequency @xmath86 , with amplitude such that the total radiated energy in the merger is @xmath12 of the total mass energy of the spacetime [ eq .  ( [ dedfmerger ] ) ] .",
    "we outline in sec .",
    "[ mergerphase ] two different `` handwaving '' arguments which suggest that in favorable cases the merger radiation efficiency may be as high as our assumed value of @xmath87 .",
    "one of these arguments , due originally to smarr @xcite and explored by detweiler @xcite , is based on extrapolation of perturbation theory results ; the other argument is based on angular momentum conservation .    our assumed radiation efficiencies of @xmath78 and @xmath12 for the ringdown and merger phases should perhaps be interpreted as reasonable upper bounds that could be achieved in favorable cases , rather than as best - guess estimates .",

    "it is not clear how relevant the head - on collision case is to the gradual inspiral ; but on the other hand , there is no other guidance available at the present time .",

( [ eradlrad ] ) with @xmath341 and with @xmath342 yields @xmath343 . hence , since the final black hole must have @xmath344 , a substantial amount of the radiation must be emitted at lower frequencies .",
    "based on the estimates ( [ eest0 ] ) and ( [ eest1 ] ) , and on the estimated upper bound @xmath337 mentioned above for the ringdown radiated energy , we perhaps optimistically take @xmath321 to be the energy radiated during merger in the equal - mass case ( which corresponds to about @xmath345 total radiated energy in the merger and ringdown ) . for non equal - mass bbhs",
    "we assume that the radiated energy is reduced by the factor ( [ reductionfactor ] ) , so that @xmath346    the rather high radiation efficiency of @xmath347 that we are assuming is probably most plausible in the context of rapidly spinning coalescing black holes .",

    "[ initialligosnr ] , [ advancedligosnr ] and [ lisasnr ] should merely be taken as illustrative .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the implications of the above signal - to - noise ratios for the required search strategies for the various types of signals , and for the distances to which these types of signals can be detected .",
    "one of the reasons that coalescences of compact objects are such good sources for gravitational - wave detectors is that the inspiral portion of the signal is very predictable , so that optimal filtering may be used in searching for the waves @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed , optimal filtering enhances the achievable snr values by a factor of roughly @xmath498 , where @xmath499 is the number of cycles in the waveform in the frequency band of the detectors . for neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) coalescences , @xmath499 will be on the order of several thousand , while for bbh coalescences it will be on the order of several hundred @xcite .",

    "moreover , for the initial ligo interferometers , the mass scale @xmath508 at which the inspiral snr becomes much smaller than the merger / ringdown snrs is not terribly high .",
    "in such high mass cases for which the merger and inspiral snrs exceed the inspiral snr , it will be necessary to perform a search for the merger and/or ringdown portions of the signal , independently of any searches for inspiral signals , in order that all possible events be detected .",
    "if one seeks to detect the waves merely by optimal filtering for the inspiral waveform , some fraction of the events will be missed which otherwise might have been detectable .",
    "in fact , it may very well turn out that merger signals from bbh coalescences could be the dominant source for the initial ligo interferometers .    therefore a search in real time should be performed in the data stream for ringdown and merger signals from high mass , bbh mergers .",
    "one might imagine that the gravitational waves would generally be easier to detect by searching for the merger signal , since we have estimated that the snr values for the merger phase are typically a factor of a few larger than those for the ringdown ( _ cf . _  figs .",
