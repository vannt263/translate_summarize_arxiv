    "harder , langlands , and rapoport introduced the notion of distinction as a tool for producing cohomologically nontrivial cycles on hilbert modular surfaces .",
    "their work was based on the following observation : if @xmath26 and if @xmath6 has nonzero cohomology with coefficients in @xmath27 ( see definition [ cohom - defn ] ) and is @xmath25-distinguished then there is a differential form @xmath28 on a locally symmetric space attached to @xmath10 that is @xmath29-isotypic under the action of certain hecke correspondences such that @xmath28 has a nonzero period over a sub - symmetric space defined by @xmath25 .",
    "harder , langlands and rapoport investigated the case where @xmath30 for a square - free positive integer @xmath31 and @xmath11 is the automorphism of @xmath10 induced by the nontrivial element of @xmath32 . as a consequence of their investigation they proved the tate conjecture for the `` non - cm '' part of the cohomology of hilbert modular surfaces .",
    "the key fact that allowed them to link galois invariant elements in an tale cohomology group to the existence of cycles was a characterization of @xmath33-distinguished cuspidal automorphic representations of @xmath34 in terms of a certain invariance property of @xmath6 under @xmath11 .",
    "the characterization of @xmath35-distinguished representations used in @xcite can be proven using a modification of the rankin - selberg method @xcite .",
    "more generally , let @xmath1 be a quadratic extension of number fields .",
    "a variation of jacquet , piatetskii - shapiro and shalika s interpretation of the rankin - selberg method similarly gives some characterization of those automorphic representations of @xmath36 distinguished by @xmath37 in terms of asai @xmath0-functions @xcite .",
    "however , in most situations a characterization of the automorphic representations of @xmath10 distinguished by @xmath25 in terms of arithmetic properties of the automorphic representation or analytic properties of @xmath0-functions attached to the automorphic representation is unknown .    to address these situations ,",
    "jacquet has introduced relative trace formulae in order to provide a ( mostly conjectural ) conceptual understanding of distinction in great generality . though the theory still is far from complete ,",
    "many interesting results are known , even in higher rank .",

    "since the locally symmetric spaces attached to @xmath40 are never hermitian for @xmath41 , the higher rank results of jacquet and lapid mentioned above can not be directly applied to the study of the tate conjecture for shimura varieties as in @xcite . despite this ,",
    "in this paper we provide one means of relating distinction of automorphic representations of @xmath42 to distinction of automorphic representations on unitary groups ( including those defining hermitian locally symmetric spaces ) .",

    "there is a finite - dimensional representation @xmath44 of @xmath45 such that @xmath6 has nonzero cohomology with coefficients in @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   there is a finite place @xmath46 of @xmath9 totally split in @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is supercuspidal .",
    "3 .   there is a finite place @xmath49 of @xmath9 totally split in @xmath47 such that @xmath50 is in the discrete series .",
    "4 .   for all places @xmath51 of @xmath9 such that @xmath47 is ramified and @xmath4 , @xmath1 are both nonsplit at @xmath51 the weak base change @xmath52 of @xmath6 to @xmath53 has the property that @xmath54 is relatively @xmath55-regular .",

    "we indicate the role of some of the assumptions in the theorem :    _ remarks . _    1 .",

    "* theorem 3.1.4 ) to conclude that the weak base change @xmath52 exists .",
    "the assumptions at the places @xmath46 and @xmath65 are made for two reasons .",
    "first , they allow us to apply known results on base change liftings from @xcite .",
    "second , they allow us to use the simple form of the relative trace formula proved in @xcite . if a relative version of the arthur - selberg trace formula were known , together with a theory of relative endoscopy , then it would probably be possible to remove the restrictions on @xmath46 and @xmath65 .",
    "assumption ( 4 ) allows us to use test functions supported on the relatively @xmath55-regular semisimple set at places where we have not proven satisfactory matching statements for arbitrary functions .",
    "the definition of a relatively @xmath55-regular admissible representation is given in ",
    "[ sec - sph ] below .",
    "the assumption that @xmath3 is quasi - split is relaxed somewhat in corollary [ main - cor ] below .    given all of these simplifying assumptions",
    ", one might be surprised that this paper is still rather long . as an explanation ,",
    "we point out that to prove our theorem we have to provide , from scratch , analogues of many standard constructions in the theory of the usual trace formula ( for example , we need analogues of many of the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this takes some space .",
    "we have tried to streamline the presentation by not working in the greatest possible generality .",
    "let @xmath6 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath59 satisfying the hypotheses of theorem [ intro - thm2 ] and admitting a weak base change @xmath52 to @xmath66 ( see  [ defn - wbc ] for our conventions regarding weak base change ) .",
    "let @xmath55 be the automorphism of @xmath67 fixing @xmath7 , and let @xmath68 .",
    "we prove theorem [ intro - thm2 ] in two steps .",
    "first , we prove that if @xmath52 is distinguished by @xmath69 and the quasi - split unitary group @xmath70 attached to @xmath71 then some automorphic representation @xmath8 nearly equivalent to @xmath6 is @xmath3 distinguished .",
    "we prove this by exhibiting identities of the form @xmath72 for a sufficiently large set of functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 that match in the sense of definition [ defn - match ] . here",
    "the sum on the left is over cuspidal automorphic representations of @xmath59 , the sum on the right is over cuspidal automorphic representations of @xmath16 , and @xmath75 is an orthonormal basis of the @xmath6-isotypic subspace of @xmath76 consisting of smooth vectors ; @xmath77 is defined similarly .",
    "we refer the reader to proposition [ prop - spect - compar ] for more details .",
    "second , the fact that @xmath52 is a base change implies that @xmath78 . by work of flicker and his collaborators ,",
    "our assumption on the pole of the asai @xmath0-function implies that @xmath52 is distinguished by @xmath69 and moreover that @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that @xmath80 , and hence by work of jacquet , lapid , and their collaborators this in turn implies that @xmath52 is distinguished by @xmath70 .",
    "this second step is contained in ",
    "[ ssec - apps ] and we will say no more about it in the introduction .    the proof of the first step is the heart of this paper and",
    "is based on a particular case of a general principle which we now explain .",
    "let @xmath81 be a connected reductive group , let @xmath82 , and let @xmath83 let @xmath11 be an automorphism of @xmath81 of order @xmath12 and let @xmath84 and @xmath13 be the subgroups fixed by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath68 , viewed as an automorphism of @xmath10 , and let @xmath85 be the subgroup fixed by @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath87 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 admits a weak base change @xmath52 to @xmath16 .",
    "in favorable circumstances the machinery developed in this paper together with suitable fundamental lemmas should imply that if @xmath52 is @xmath25-distinguished and @xmath70-distinguished then a cuspidal automorphic representation @xmath8 nearly equivalent to @xmath6 is @xmath88-distinguished .",
    "we mention two large obstacles to turning the general principle @xmath89 into a theorem in any given case .",
    "first is the current lack of a relative analogue of the arthur - selberg trace formula or a topological relative trace formula .",
    "second is the current lack of a theory of relative endoscopy and the fundamental lemmas that should come along with the theory . if we had the tools of a relative arthur - selberg trace formula and the theory of relative endoscopy in hand , one could probably remove the annoying local restrictions in theorem [ intro - thm2 ] and prove much more general versions of the principle indicated above .",
    "however , we caution that if one considers involutions @xmath11 that are not galois involutions as we are primarily concerned with in this paper , there seem to be new phenomena lurking that we can not explain here .",
    "these new phenomena may make the principle false as it is stated , though we believe something close to it is true .",
    "we end this outline with some speculation regarding the undefined term `` relative endoscopy . ''",
    "the theory of ( twisted ) endoscopy , when complete , should yield an understanding of automorphic representations of classical groups in terms of those on general linear groups via a twisted trace formula ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "we conjecture that a similar theory will relate distinguished representations on a classical group to representations on @xmath40 that are distinguished with respect to two subgroups .",
    "we believe that theorem [ intro - thm2 ] provides an interesting implication of these relations in the special case where endoscopy reduces to base change .",
    "we note that our approach to the relative trace formula is modeled on that exposed in @xcite and the introduction to @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a quadratic extension , suppose @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and let @xmath11 be induced by the nontrivial automorphism @xmath11 of @xmath92 .",
    "then the relatively elliptic part of the trace formula developed in @xcite is roughly the `` @xmath93 '' case of our theory .",
    "if we instead let @xmath94 be the `` split '' quadratic extension and again let @xmath11 be the automorphism of @xmath81 induced by the nontrivial @xmath9-automorphism of @xmath1 , then our trace formula comparing distinction on @xmath95 to distinction on @xmath81 is roughly equivalent to the `` elliptic part '' of the trace formula comparison used to establish quadratic base change in @xcite ( though , of course , langlands treats general cyclic extensions ) .",
    "this justifies our claim in the abstract that our formulae simultaneously generalize the relative trace formula and the twisted trace formula ( in the quadratic case ) .",
    "see proposition [ prop - spect - compar ] for a precise statement regarding trace formula comparisons .",
    "we now give a synopsis of the various sections .",
    "we fix some notation in the next section . in",
    " [ ssec - basic - notat ] , following @xcite we develop a notion of relative classes and relative @xmath55-classes generalizing conjugacy classes and twisted conjugacy classes , respectively .",
    "a norm map is also defined and studied , and in  [ ssec - norm - exist ] we prove that it has the properties one would expect , at least in the `` biquadratic unitary '' case ( see  [ ssec - basic - notat ] ) .",
    "section [ sec - matching ] studies the corresponding notion of matching of stable local relative orbital integrals .",
    "we also prove the fundamental lemma for unit elements in the `` biquadratic case '' and the fundamental lemma for hecke functions when various objects split ( e.g. @xmath4 ) . in  [ sec - match - ram ]",
    "we prove that one can find some function in @xmath96 matching a given function in @xmath97 for nonarchimedian @xmath51 .",
    "we define the notion of a relatively @xmath55-regular admissible representation in  [ sec - sph ] ; we require this notion due to our incomplete knowledge of matching functions .",
    "section [ sec - prestab ] concerns globalization of stable relative orbital integrals . here",
    "we follow labesse s formulation @xcite of the work of kottwitz and shelstad ( following langlands , see @xcite , @xcite ) on the usual trace formula . in  [ sec - group - ell ] we discuss the geometric expansion of the stable twisted relative trace formula . in  [ sec - rtf ] we use the main theorem of @xcite together with all of the previous work to give a spectral expansion of the twisted relative trace formula on @xmath10 and the relative trace formula on @xmath81 , at least in the case relevant for the proof of theorem [ intro - thm2 ] . as noted above , ",
