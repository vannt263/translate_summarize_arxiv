    "after the discovery of `` non - trivial parts '' in three - particle correlations at rhic @xcite , which are compatible with the existence of mach cones @xcite , it is interesting to see how the signal for mach cones will look like under the influence of a medium created at the lhc in pbpb - collisions .",
    "mach cones caused by ultrarelativistic jets going in midrapidity will create a double - peaked two - particle correlation function @xmath1 .",
    "those peaks are located at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the speed of sound as obtained by the equation of state .",
    "the model mace ( `` mach cones evolution '' ) has been introduced to simulate the propagation of sound waves through a medium and recognize and evaluate mach cones @xcite .",
    "the medium is calculated without influence of a jet using the hydrodynamical particle - in - cell - method ( pic ) @xcite . for the equation of state ,",
    "a massless ideal gas is assumed , so that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the sound waves are propagated independently of the propagation of the medium and without solving hydrodynamical equations . only the velocity field created by pic",
    "is used . to recognize collective phenomena , the shape of the region affected by sound waves",
    "is evaluated .",
    "the correlation functions from the backward peak show a clear double - peaked structure .",
    "the data for arbitrary jet origin and jet direction ( minimum jet bias ) is shown in ( a ) . here , the peaks are visible at @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to a speed of sound of @xmath7 . note that the contributions from the forward jet are not shown .",
    "the peak created by the forward jet is not calculated .",
    "( a ) : minimum jet bias ( see text ) with peaks at @xmath8 .",
    "( b ) : midrapidity jets starting from a position 70  % on the way outside left and right of as well as in the middle . ]    deeper insight into different jet directions do not show a qualitatively different picture .",
    "triggers on the origin of the jet , though , show the dependence of the correlation function on the position where the jet was created ( see ( b ) ) .",
    "it shows that only the jet coming from the middle of the reaction results in a symmetric correlation function with peaks at the mach angle @xmath9 .",
    "all other jets result in correlations that have peaks at different angles , with the deviation getting bigger when going away from the middle .",
    "therefore , the speed of sound will always appear to be smaller than it actually is .",
    "if sound waves are produced from jet quenching in lhc - collisions , the two - particle correlation function will show the expected double - humped structure in the backward region .",
    "the peaks will , though , be further apart than @xmath10 , thus alluding to a speed of sound smaller than is actually present in the medium .",
    "the only case in which the true speed of sound can be measured is a midrapidity jet that creates a symmetric correlation function .",
