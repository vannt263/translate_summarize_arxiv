    "this correspondence is the starting point for a rich relationship between the algebraic constraints on @xmath0 imposed by orders , and the dynamical constraints of @xmath0actions on @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "the correspondence has already proved fruitful in many contexts ; one good example is the relationship between orderability of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds , and the existence of certain codimension one foliations or laminations shown in @xcite .    for fixed @xmath0 , we let @xmath12 denote the set of all left orders on @xmath0 , and @xmath1 the set of circular orders .",
    "these spaces have a natural topology ; that on @xmath1 comes from its identification with a subset of the infinite product @xmath13 .",

    "thus , an important first question is to identify its isolated points .",
    "even this basic question can be highly nontrivial . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that the space of circular orders on the free group @xmath14 has no isolated points .",
    "our first result is a disproof of this conjecture , using only the dynamics of group actions on the circle .",

    "classes _ of isolated points under the natural conjugation action of @xmath14 on @xmath15 .",
    "we also show also that lifts of these actions to the real line give isolated left orders on the central extension @xmath16 , answering a question of @xcite in the negative .",
    "precisely , we have :    the pure braid group @xmath17 has infinitely many distinct conjugacy classes of isolated left orders .",
    "moving beyond this special case , the main result of this article is a complete dynamical characterization of isolated circular and left orders .",
    "we show that , under the correspondence between circular ( or left ) orders and action on @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the isolated points in @xmath1 and in @xmath12 correspond precisely to actions with a strong form of rigidity .",

    "the left order case is completely analogous .",
    "we note that some related results for left orders are already implicit in the work in @xcite .",

    "when combined with standard facts about dynamics of groups acting on the circle , this gives new information about spaces of circular orders .",

    "[ dense orbit cor ] suppose @xmath25 is a countable group such that some point @xmath22 has trivial stabilizer and dense orbit .",
    "then the order on @xmath0 induced by the orbit of @xmath22 is not isolated in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular this shows that , if the dynamical realization of a circular order @xmath26 on @xmath0 is minimal , then @xmath26 is not isolated .",
    "( see theorem [ isolated linear part ] and following remarks . )    as another illustration of the power of theorem [ characterization thm ] , we use it to give an alternative proof that @xmath15 has infinitely many isolated points .",
    "in fact , we are able to explicitly describe infinite families of isolated points in @xmath4 , for all @xmath27 . the most concise way to describe these uses a little hyperbolic geometry ( as in the theorem statement below ) , but they can also be described explicitly in elementary terms .",

    "this gives an action of @xmath664 on @xmath665 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath666 is the basepoint of @xmath617 , then its projection @xmath312 has trivial stabilizer and defines a circular order on @xmath0 .",
    "finally , one checks easily that applying the pullback construction described above recovers @xmath617 .",

    "on @xmath428 we can put again @xmath678 , and extend this ordering lexicographically to @xmath0 using any ordering on @xmath679 , so that @xmath428 is a proper convex subgroup . the resulting ordering @xmath680 on @xmath0 agrees with @xmath678 on @xmath33 ,",
    "so by choosing @xmath33 large it can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath678 . however ,",
    "if on @xmath681 we put the lexicographic ordering coming from the natural identification of @xmath674 $ ] with a direct sum of infinitely many copies of @xmath372 , then every element of @xmath0 fixes a point in the dynamical realization of @xmath680 .",

    ", there exists a neighborhood of @xmath683 in @xmath684 consisting of left orders for which the generator @xmath373 of @xmath372 is cofinal .",
    "any such left order descends to a circular order on @xmath0 .",

    "related work in an extensive study of orderings on braid groups can be found in @xcite .",
    "secondly , @xmath701 is an example of a right - angled artin group .",
    "perhaps it is possible to give a complete characterization of which raags have isolated left orders .",
    "finally , this example also shows that direct products behave quite differently than free products  in @xcite , it is shown that the free product of any two left orderable groups has no isolated left orders ."
