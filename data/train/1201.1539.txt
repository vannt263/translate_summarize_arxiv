    "however , several significant partial solutions were obtained @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be a face - to - face tiling of @xmath0 by parallel copies of a parallelohedron @xmath6 .",
    "choose an arbitrary @xmath1-dimensional face @xmath2 of the tiling .",

    "then there exists a complete @xmath4-dimensional cone fan @xmath11 ( _ the fan of @xmath2 _ ) that splits @xmath10 into convex polyhedral cones with vertex @xmath12 , and a neighborhood @xmath13 such that every face @xmath14 corresponds to a cone @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 speaking informally , @xmath11 has the same combinatorics as the transversal section of @xmath7 in a small neighborhood of @xmath2 .",
    "the definition above is equivalent to the definition of a _ star _ of a face @xmath2 , introduced by ryshkov and rybnikov @xcite , yet seems to be more formal .",
    "studying the combinatorial structure of such cone fans proved to be an effective tool to verify the voronoi conjecture in special cases @xcite .    for fixed @xmath4 and varying @xmath5 , it is a complicated problem to classify all possible combinatorial types of @xmath11 if a positive answer to conjecture  [ voronoi ] is not preassumed .",
    "the classification for @xmath17 has been obtained in @xcite and consists of 2 combinatorial types of cone fans shown in figure [ f1 ] .",

    "[ f2 ]    the case @xmath20 has been partially considered in @xcite , but the complete classification was not obtained , and for @xmath21 almost nothing is known .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that a classification is possible _ in principle _ for every @xmath4 , i.e. the list of all combinatoral types of @xmath22 , where @xmath2 is a @xmath1-face , is finite .",
    "the idea is to obtain an upper bound for the number of tiling parallelohedra incident to a face @xmath2 .",

    ", the fan of @xmath2 necessarily belongs to one of those combinatorial types .    for a centrally symmetric polytope @xmath33 denote by @xmath34 its center of symmetry .    to proceed with the proof of theorem [ 2k ]",
    "recall several basic properties of parallelohedral tilings .    1 .",
    "a parallelohedron @xmath6 is a centrally symmetric polytope ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   the set @xmath35 is a lattice ( see also  @xcite ) . under assumption @xmath36",

    "moreover , @xmath41 a face @xmath2 of @xmath7 representable in the form @xmath42 , where @xmath38 , is called _ standard _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "for a better understanding of the aim , first restrict oneself to the voronoi case . start considering this case with a folklore lemma .    [ parity ]",
    "let @xmath38 be the 2 distinct parallelohedra such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 belong to the same class modulo @xmath45 .",
    "( in other words , @xmath46 and @xmath47 belong to the same parity class . ) then @xmath48 .    according to property 3 of a parallelohedral tiling",
    "( see  page  ) , @xmath49    on the other hand , since @xmath43 and @xmath44 belong to the same class @xmath50 , @xmath51 therefore @xmath52 is a center of some parallelohedron @xmath53 different from @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath54 which is a contradiction to ( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "lemma is proved .",
    "the technique used in the proof is rather standard .",
    "for example , similar methods were used in  @xcite .",

    "let @xmath55 be the voronoi tiling for some @xmath5-dimensional lattice @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath55 has a dual _ delaunay _",
    "tiling @xmath57 .",
    "every @xmath1-face @xmath2 in @xmath55 has a @xmath4-dimensional dual face @xmath58 in @xmath57 such that @xmath59 moreover , the combinatorial structure of @xmath58 completely describes the combinatorial structure of @xmath11 . in particular",
    ", @xmath24 is equal to the number of vertices of @xmath58 .",
    "[ vcase ] the statement of theorem  [ 2k ] holds for voronoi tilings .",
    "following the argument above , it is sufficient to prove that @xmath58 has at most @xmath3 vertices . according to the properties of a lattice delaunay tiling , @xmath60 so the set of vertices of @xmath58 is a subset of some @xmath4-dimensional lattice @xmath61 .    by lemma  [ parity ] ,",
    "every 2 vertices of @xmath58 belong to different classes @xmath50 , otherwise 2 parallelohedra of the same parity class had to intersect at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore every 2 vertices of @xmath58 belong to different classes @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath63 has exactly @xmath3 classes @xmath62 , there are at most @xmath3 vertices of @xmath58 .",
    "proposition is proved .",
    "another approach to estimate the number of vertices of @xmath58 is described in  ( * ? ? ? * proposition  13.2.8 ) .",
    "thus , if the voronoi conjecture ( conjecture  [ voronoi ] ) has a positive answer , theorem  [ 2k ] is proved .    in the way similar to corollary  [ finiteness ]",
    ", proposition  [ vcase ] implies that there are finitely many combinatorial types of @xmath58 for fixed @xmath4 and regardless of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , an algorithm for classification all possible lattice delaunay @xmath4-cells is given in @xcite an idea of such algorithms certainly belongs to voronoi @xcite who constructed an algorithm to classify all possible combinatorial types of voronoi parallelohedra .",
    "for an arbitrary parallelohedral tiling @xmath7 and its @xmath1-face @xmath2 it is also possible to introduce in the similar way as ( [ 51 ] ) the set @xmath64 as far as author knows , there are no satisfactory results on @xmath65 in the general case .    in the case",
    "@xmath66 theorem  [ 2k ] easily follows from lemma  [ parity ] .",
    "yet the inequality ( [ 10 ] ) remains an open problem .",
    "the methods described above essentially involve the assumption that conjecture  [ voronoi ] has a positive answer .",
    "however , theorem  [ 2k ] can be proved in non - voronoi case as well , by exploiting several other ideas .",
    "the proof of theorem [ 2k ] consists of the 3 main steps .    1 .",
    "construct a set @xmath67 of all faces of a parallelohedron @xmath68 such that every 2 faces of the set are equivalent by a @xmath37-translation .",
    "prove that @xmath69 .",
    "2 .   refine the notion of _ an antipodal set _ given in  @xcite . prove that the set @xmath70 is antipodal ( here @xmath8 is the above defined projection along @xmath9 onto the complementary space @xmath10 ) .",
    "3 .   estimate the cardinality of an arbitrary antipodal set in @xmath32 .",
    "the third step uses the technique introduced by danzer and grnbaum in @xcite . however , @xcite deals with antipodal full - dimensional point sets in @xmath32 , i.e. the sets @xmath71 satisfying @xmath72 .",
    "although danzer and grnbaum s theorem can not be used directly here , it is not hard to extend the technique to the class of antipodal sets satisfying the refined definition .",
    "to introduce a uniform notation , put @xmath73 . choose a parallelohedron @xmath68 such that @xmath74",
    "let @xmath75 be the set of all faces of @xmath76 equivalent to @xmath77 up to a @xmath37-translation .    denote by @xmath78 the vector of @xmath37-translation such that @xmath79 for every @xmath80 define @xmath81 clearly , @xmath82 .",
    "[ valence ]    @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath83 , one has @xmath84    therefore there are at least @xmath85 parallelohedra of @xmath7 meeting at @xmath77 , because the parallelohedra @xmath86 are pairwise different .",
    "suppose there exists one more parallelohedron @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "thus there is a non - zero @xmath37-translation @xmath89 such that @xmath90 . obviously , @xmath91 , so @xmath92 for every @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath95 , @xmath96 consequently , @xmath97 is a face of @xmath76 equivalent to @xmath77 up to a @xmath37-translation , hence @xmath98 for some @xmath99 . by definition of @xmath100",
    ", one has @xmath101 therefore @xmath102 , which is a contradiction .",

    "the hyperplane @xmath118 is supporting to @xmath119 , so the hyperplane @xmath118 is supporting to @xmath124 .",

    "the hyperplanes @xmath115 and @xmath116 are distinct because the point @xmath130 lies strictly between them .",
    "thus the required hyperplanes are constructed for every pair of points @xmath131 .",
    "lemma [ antipod ] is proved .",
    "[ card ]    let @xmath132 be an antipodal set . then @xmath133 .    denote by @xmath134 the homothety with center @xmath135 and coefficient @xmath136 .    take an arbitrary @xmath137 and prove that @xmath138    indeed , let @xmath139 be the hyperplane parallel and equidistant to the hyperplanes @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "then the sets @xmath140 and @xmath141 lie in different open half - spaces in respect to @xmath139 and therefore do not intersect .",
    "let @xmath142 be the affine dimension of @xmath71 .",
