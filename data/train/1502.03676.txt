    "in the early 20th century herman minkowski ( 1864 - 1909 ) published a whole family of metrics ( the distance formula ) defined on euclidean space . if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two points , then @xmath4 is the distance between the two points . here",
    "@xmath5 gives taxicab metric and @xmath6 gives euclidean metric . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with taxicab geometry ( @xmath5 case ) .",
    "taxicab geometry is based on an ideal city in which all the streets are assumed to run either north and south or east and west @xcite . in a continuous taxicab geometry the blocks ( buildings )",
    "are assumed to be of point size . in this paper",
    "we are particularly interested in discrete taxicab geometry ( dtg ) in which the blocks have small but finite size . our main goal is to represent the streets by strings of integers whose algebraic structure is similar to unary numeral system . in standard numeral system one",
    "deals with the strings of symbol 1 ( base-1 system ) . in this paper ,",
    "on the other hand , we use more than one symbol . therefore",
    ", we shall call it quasi - unary ( qu ) representation . an earlier version of this work can be found in @xcite .",
    "the approach in this paper is , however , different .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism is presented in section  [ formalism ] .",
    "length , inner - product , translation , rotation , shape transformation and functions are discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider an @xmath0dimensional discrete euclidean space ( des ) .",
    "a 2@xmath7dim des is shown in fig .  .",
    "it consists of pixels ( blocks ) and edges ( streets of width zero ) .",
    "a taxicab can only run along the streets and we assume that it can only pick up and drop passengers at the corners of a block .",
    "for example , if a cab goes 3 blocks to the east and then 4 blocks to the north then the total distance covered by the cab is 7 block .",
    "this is the taxicab distance .",
    "in contrast , the euclidean distance would be 5 blocks .",
    "dim discrete euclidean space.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    next we come to label the streets",
    ". we shall denote @xmath8axis by @xmath9axis , @xmath10axis by @xmath11axis , @xmath12axis by @xmath13axis , and @xmath14axis by @xmath0axis .",
    "the origin of coordinate system is labeled as a dot ` @xmath15 ' .",
    "the origin can be thought of as the reference point .",
    "a unit _ move _ or a _ walk _ parallel to positive 1-axis is labeled as @xmath16 .",
    "it describes a directed line from corner to corner of a block .",
    "an arrow is placed at the head of the line , that is , @xmath17 if a cab starts from the origin and moves one unit towards the right , it will be labeled as a dot followed by @xmath18 , @xmath19 similarly two consecutive moves towards the right can be obtained by concatenating @xmath16 with itself , @xmath20 our labeling scheme is analogous to _ directed graph_. however , there is a difference . only the edges are labeled . except for the origin , the vertices ( corners ) are left unlabeled .",
    "it is not , however .",
    "necessary that a walk always starts from the origin .",
    "for example , @xmath21 is also possible which means that the initial point is one unit to the left of the origin ( negative @xmath9axis ) . in this case , start from the left go one unit towards the origin and then pass the origin to obtain @xmath22 .",
    "thus the origin ( dot ) can float anywhere in the label set .",
    "the moves / walks parallel to negative directions and the other axes can be similarly defined .",
    "a unit walk parallel to negative @xmath9axis is labeled @xmath23 .",
    "similarly @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is a unit walk parallel to positive ( negative ) @xmath11axis , and so on .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath16 , @xmath24 ,  work like _ basis_. the opposite of @xmath16 is @xmath23 , for instance .",
    "they nullify the effect of each other when concatenated in a row , @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents no move .",
    "this means that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are strings , then @xmath30 where @xmath31 is not a product but a concatenation of @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "further , a string of finite @xmath16 s is labeled as @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the number of @xmath16 in the sequence ) .",
    "an infinite string of @xmath16 s is labeled as @xmath34 .    using the above method",
    ", we can draw any geometrical object ( shape ) .",
    "a square , for example , is drawn in fig .  . as we can see",
    "our labeling scheme involves concatenation of strings .",
    "it is similar to unary numeral system .",
    "but standard unary numbers involve strings of symbol 1 ( base1 numeral system ) .",
    "our case , on the other hand , involves more than one symbol .",
    "take , for example , the square in fig .   which involves four different symbols .",
    "we shall call our representation as quasi - unary ( qu ) representation .",
    "in fact qu representation is a base(@xmath1 ) numeral system ( see below ) .",
    "our labeling scheme so far only allows us to draw connected geometrical objects",
    ". we can also draw disconnected geometrical objects that are made up of several pieces .",
    "we can do so by introducing new labels for missing links .",
    "consider @xmath35axis ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be two line segments separated by a unit distance .",
    "the missing link or street or blank character , in the forward direction , is represented by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore the union of @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be written as @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the two line segments are separated by @xmath39 .",
    "similarly @xmath42 can be understood .",
    "the symbols @xmath43 can be used for several purposes .",
    "they are also used for translation ( see section [ translation ] ) .",
    "they are used also for leaving the axis by jumping off and then a unit distance away returning back to the axis .    to summarize this section , we note that any geometrical object can be labeled according to the map @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the set of geometrical objects such as line segments , curves etc . , and @xmath46 is the set of the corresponding labels",
