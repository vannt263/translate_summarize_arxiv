    "x - ray observations are crucial in getting insights into the physical mechanism responsible for launching and accelerating quasar outflows .",
    "for example , radiatively - driven accretion disk wind models predict the presence of high column densities of x - ray absorbing gas which prevents the overionization of the uv - driven wind , allowing for its effective acceleration ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the physical properties of this x - ray absorbing gas are predicted to be variable with time ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , high signal - to - noise ratio x - ray observations of bal qsos are rare , because of their known `` x - ray weakness ''  e.g. @xcite  @xcite ; but see @xcite  @xcite",
    ".    we present the results of multiple xmm-_newton _ observations of two low redshift mini - bal qsos , pg  1126 - 041 ( z=0.06 ) and pg  1351 + 640 ( z=0.09 ) .",
    "we analyzed five epic datasets , three for pg  1351 + 640 ( observed in 2004/12/31 , 2008/06/06 and 2008/06/08 ) and two for pg  1126 - 041 ( observed in 2008/06/15 and 2008/12/13 ) .",
    "we reduced all the datasets following standard xmm-_newton _ analysis threads . + * pg  1351 + 640 : *   the source flux dropped by a factor of @xmath010 in the soft ( @xmath1  kev ) band , while remaining constant at @xmath2  kev during 4 years .",
    "no changes are detected during the two days elapsed between the two observations taken in june 2008 , so we analyzed them together .",
    "the best fit model ( @xmath3d.o.f.=875/877 , fig.[fig1 ] , left ) is a powerlaw continuum with @xmath4 absorbed by two layers of ionized gas ; one is totally covering the continuum source , has a column density @xmath5  @xmath6 and an ionization parameter @xmath7  erg  cm  s@xmath8 in both states .",
    "the other ionized absorber has an ionization parameter @xmath9  erg  cm  s@xmath8 and is covering  50% (  90% ) of the source , with a column density @xmath10  @xmath6 in the 2004(2008 ) observation . + * pg  1126 - 041 : *  the 0.2 - 10 kev source flux increased by a factor of @xmath060% in the six months elapsed between the two observations presented here .",
    "the best fit model ( @xmath3d.o.f.=96/102 , fig.[fig1 ] , right ) is a powerlaw continuum with @xmath11 absorbed by a layer of ionized gas covering @xmath12% of the source , with a column density @xmath13  @xmath6 and an ionization parameter @xmath14  erg  cm  s@xmath8 in the 2008 june(december ) observation .",
    "our observations are consistent with radiatively - driven accretion disk wind models in that they find high column densities of x - ray absorbing gas along the line of sight , and strong variability in the physical properties of these ionized absorbers .",
    "future , deeper x - ray observations of quasars which show powerful uv - driven winds are needed to confirm this scenario : for example , the adopted models predict the presence of strong iron absorption lines which can not be detected with the present moderate signal - to - noise ratio spectra .",
