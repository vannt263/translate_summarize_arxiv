    "perturbative qcd allows us to describe the hard part of hadron production process .",
    "the most essential success is achieved in the description of the heavy meson production and the heavy quarkonium production at large transverse momentum , where heavy quarks is produced in the hard process followed by the soft hadronization process .",
    "the hadronization is described by common coefficient which is slightly depends on transverse momentum @xmath4 .",
    "it is not unlikely , that the final state interaction can strongly brake the factorization at small transverse momenta and small energies .",
    "the existence of charge asymmetry in the charm particle production confirm this supposition .",
    "thus , we expect the deviation from the common pqcd fragmentation mechanism at small energies and small @xmath4 .",
    "so , the recent belle collaboration research @xcite of pair production @xmath5 and inclusive production @xmath6 in the @xmath7-annihilation at @xmath8 gev results in the production cross section values , which exceed the pqcd predictions @xcite by order of magnitude . the experimental shapes of some cross section distribution for the process @xmath1 crucially differ from the pqcd predictions .",
    "it was shown in recent works @xcite , that the account of electromagnetic @xmath9 and @xmath5 pair production increase almost twice the theoretical estimation of the cross section .",
    "however , it does not remove the existing discrepancy between the pqcd predictions and the experimental data for @xmath10 production process .",
    "one more disagreement takes place for the prompt @xmath0 production in the processes @xmath2 and @xmath1 : the experimental value @xcite    @xmath11    contradicts pqcd estimations@xcite@xmath12    it is worth to mention , that the both cross section @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the same order of @xmath15 and at @xmath8 gev slightly depend on the used models , as well as on the chosen scale .    in this article",
    "we shall discuss in detail the existing discrepancies between the pqcd predictions and the experimental data .",
    "the experimental values of the production cross section for the inclusive process @xmath17 which are reconstructed from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 equal to @xmath20 correspondingly@xcite .    in the frame work of pqcd the process ( [ jpsicc ] ) is described by the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ ee ] . the process amplitude can be represented as the hard @xmath21 pair production amplitude multiplied by amplitudes of the soft fusion into @xmath21-quarkonium .",
    "such estimations were done independently by several research groups @xcite .",
    "these calculations are in a good accordance to each other and gives the cross section value : results in twice as much value of this cross section . ]",
    "@xmath22 which underestimates the experimental data ( [ sigjpsicc ] ) by the oder of magnitude . the cross section ( [ sigjpsiccqcd ] ) increase due to the increase of @xmath15 do not eliminate this discrepancy .",
    "the factorization approach is not most likely reason of the disagreement .",
    "it was shown in work @xcite , that the factorization approach predicts practically the same cross section values , as ones calculated in the frame work of the method , which is based on the quark - hadron duality hypothesis , and where no factorization , no information about wave function are used .",
    "so , @xmath10-production cross section values calculated for the color singlet state of @xmath21-pair in the duality interval @xmath23 ( @xmath24 gev ) for @xmath25 and @xmath26 gev equal to @xcite :    @xmath27    @xmath28    it is worth to compare these results with the production cross section of all @xmath29-wave quarkonium states :    @xmath30    it is clear from ( [ sig05 ] , [ sig1 ] ) and ( [ sigs ] ) that , the rough estimation of the cross section for the process ( [ jpsicc ] ) , based on duality hypothesis , as well as the more rigorous factorization method lead to same cross section value .",
    "nevertheless , as it was mentioned in introduction , this prediction underestimates belle experimental data by order of magnitude .",
    "it is necessary to note another important circumstance .",
    "the total @xmath10 production cross section calculated by us at @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev and @xmath8 equals to @xmath31 which makes up @xmath32 of the total cross section of the @xmath21-pair production at the same energy . at @xmath33 boson peak , where the interaction energy is higher by order of magnitude",
    ", the value of @xmath34 is about @xmath35 . such behavior of the probability @xmath34 to produce the additional @xmath21-pair is described by pqcd calculation well @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ sig4c ] ) is less than experimental cross section value for the process @xmath6 .",
    "the latter circumstance could indicate the strong suppression of the four @xmath36-meson production .",
    "the cross section of the electromagnetic @xmath10 production forms about 2.5% of the total production cross section ( [ sig4c ] ) : @xmath37    the theoretical predictions for the cross section of the electromagnetic production of the @xmath29-wave states @xcite - wave state estimated in the recent work @xcite is nearly two times less than predicted in @xcite . ]",
    "are several times greater than experimental value of @xmath10 production .",
    "perhaps , this fact indicates the underestimation of the experimental value of @xmath38 .",
    "also , it is not unlikely , that electromagnetic mechanism of the @xmath10 production is essentially differ from qcd production mechanism .",
    "let us consider one more process , which contributes to the inclusive @xmath0 production ( see diagrams in fig .  [ jpsigg]):@xmath40    to study this process in detail one need to read the papers@xcite .",
    "the process cross section calculated in the frame work of color singlet model at @xmath8 gev and @xmath25 equals to@xmath41    the estimation of @xmath6 production in the frame work of the same model leads to the following ratio between the cross sections : @xmath42 it is necessary to compare this ratio value with the experimental one ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "the prediction uncertainty of ratio ( [ theor - ratio ] ) is smaller than the cross section uncertainties themselves , because ( [ theor - ratio ] ) does not include the nonrelativistic amplitude of the soft process @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the both processes @xmath2 and @xmath1 are characterized by approximately the same virtualities , that is why the ratio ( [ theor - ratio ] ) does not depend on factorization scale chosen to calculate @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth to point out , that some difficulties exist for the prompt using of the pqcd to predict the @xmath44 production .",
    "it is well known that the essential discrepancy exits between the lo pqcd predictions and the experimental data at small digluon masses @xmath45 for decays @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that taking into account next order in the calculations strongly modify the spectrum at small digluon masses .",
    "the analogous effect can be achieved by using the effective nonzero mass of gluon . to estimate the gluonic mass correction for the @xmath44 production cross section we follow the work @xcite and",
    "choose the gluonic mass to be 1.18 gev ( as it was shown in@xcite , this mass value is needed to describe the photonic spectrum in the decay @xmath48 ) . in our case",
    "the nonzero gluon mass shifts the @xmath45 spectrum to the region of large @xmath45 values and decrease two times the cross section value ( see fig .  [ mgg ] ) . for chosen gluon mass",
    "the cross section ratio becomes equal to@xmath49    it is clear , that the corrections by coused nonzero gluon mass does not remove disagreement between the pqcd prediction and the experimental data .",
    "@xmath50 , pb / gev    @xmath45 , gev",
    "the research of @xmath10 production would not be complete without the discussion of the doubly charmed baryon @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath51 production cross section can be estimated by the same two methods , which are applied to calculate the @xmath52 production .",
    "the first method is based on the factorization theorem . in the frame work of this approach",
    "the @xmath3 production can be represented as the hard @xmath10 production followed by @xmath53-quark fusion into the color antitriplet state of @xmath54-diquark .",
    "this fusion is described by the general coefficient , which is proportional to the @xmath54-diquark wave function ( it is worth to note that the situation is analogous to one for @xmath0 production ) . at large energies of @xmath7-interaction",
    "the @xmath54-diquark production cross section is calculated by convolution of single @xmath21-pair production with the fragmentation function @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this asymptotic regime does not set in at energies , which are researched by belle collaboration .",
    "thus , it is necessary to take into account the total set of the nonasymptotic terms . for @xmath25 such calculation",
    "leads to the following cross section value : @xmath56 the ratio of @xmath57 production cross section and the single @xmath21-pair production cross section equals to @xmath58 the largest uncertainty of this method is coused by the uncertainty of @xmath59-diquark wave function .",
    "another calculation type is based on the quark - hadron duality hypothesis . in the frame work of this method",
    "the diquark production cross section is evaluated by formula @xmath60 which results in the following cross section values for the chosen duality intervals @xmath61 : @xmath62 @xmath63 the expected number of doubly charmed baryons at the luminosity @xmath64@xmath65sec@xmath66 is about @xmath67 pear year .",
    "the momentum distribution of the @xmath59-diquark production cross section is preformed in fig .",
    "[ xicc_p ] .",
    "one can conclude from our discussion , that the cross section value of @xmath51 production is close to the cross section value of @xmath6 production .",
    "thus if one will discover the mechanism , which will explain the large @xmath0 production cross section at belle experiment , then , it is not unlikely , that analogous mechanism will predict the large cross section value of double charmed baryon production",
    ". the latter value will be several times greater than predicted by us in the frame work of pqcd .",
