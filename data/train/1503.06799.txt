    "galaxies in denser environments are more likely to have suppressed ( quiescent ) star formation and little - to - no cold gas than galaxies of similar stellar mass , @xmath4 , in less dense environments .",
    "the observed environmental effects within the local group ( lg ) , on the satellite galaxies within the halos of the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda ( m31 ) , are particularly strong ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even compared to the already strong effects on ( more massive ) satellites within massive groups / clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , dwarf galaxies around the mw / m31 show a strikingly sharp and nearly complete transition in their properties within @xmath11 ( approximately the virial radius , @xmath12 , of the mw or m31 ) , from irregular to spheroidal morphologies , from significant to little - to - no cold atomic gas , and from star - forming to quiescent .",
    "this trend has just a few exceptions : 4 gas - rich , star - forming galaxies persist within the halos of the mw ( the lmc and smc ) and m31 ( lgs 3 and ic 10 ) , and 4 - 5 quiescent , gas - poor galaxies reside well beyond @xmath12 of either the mw or m31 : cetus @xcite , tucana @xcite , kkr 25 @xcite , kks 3 @xcite , and possibly andromeda xviii , though cetus and tucana may have orbited within the mw halo @xcite .",
    "this efficient satellite quenching is particularly striking because , other than kkr 25 and kks 3 , at @xmath13 all known galaxies that are sufficiently isolated ( @xmath14 from a more massive galaxy ) are star - forming @xcite .",
    "thus , the mw and m31 halos show the strongest environmental influence over their satellites of any known systems , making the lg a compelling laboratory for studying environmental processes on galaxies .    several such processes within a host halo can regulate the gas content , star formation , morphology , and eventual disruption of satellites , including gravitational tidal forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy  galaxy tidal interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy  galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ram - pressure stripping of extended gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or inter - stellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key astrophysical challenge is understanding the relative importance of these , including which ( if any ) dominate , and how they vary across both satellite and host masses .",
    "one strong constraint comes from determining the timescale over which environmental quenching occurs , as previous works explored at higher masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for the satellite dwarf galaxies in the lg , recent works showed that their environmental quenching _",
    "efficiency _ is higher than for higher - mass satellites @xcite . in this letter , we combine the observed quiescent fractions for satellites in the mw / m31 halos with their typical infall times from cosmological simulations to infer the timescales over which environmental processes remove their gas and quench star formation . motivated by @xcite , we also consider the possible impact of group preprocessing on satellites before they fell into the mw / m31 halos .",
    "we also compare with previous works on more massive satellites , to synthesize satellite quenching across the observable range of @xmath6 .",
    "to examine the observed properties of dwarf galaxies in the lg , we use the compilation from @xcite , which includes all galaxies known at that time within @xmath15 of the sun .",
    "we also include the more recent observations of cold atomic gas mass from @xcite .",
    "we define `` satellite '' galaxies as those within @xmath1 of either the mw or m31 , motivated by the observed sharp transition in star formation , gas mass , and morphology within this distance .",
    "observed dwarf galaxies show a tight correlation between morphology , star formation , and cold gas mass : all spheroidals have little - to - no detectable cold gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and almost all irregulars have significant cold gas and ongoing star formation .",
    "thus , we define `` quiescent '' galaxies as having @xmath16 or , if they have no cold gas constraints , having colors / morphologies that resemble spheroidals . by this definition ,",
    "the only star - forming , gas - rich satellites are : lmc ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and smc ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) around the mw , lgs 3 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and ic 10 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) around m31 .",
    "for each dwarf galaxy out to @xmath25 , figure  [ fig : local_group ] shows its distance from nearest host ( mw or m31 ) versus @xmath4 .",
    "almost all quiescent galaxies are within @xmath26 of their host .",
    "the black curve shows the detection limit ( and extrapolation ) for dwarf spheroidal - like galaxies in sdss @xcite , which highlights completeness at different @xmath4 .      to measure the infall times of satellites , we use exploring the local volume in simulations ( elvis ) , a suite of cosmological zoom - in @xmath27-body simulations intended to model the lg @xcite in @xmath28cdm cosmology : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . within the zoom - in regions ,",
    "the particle mass is @xmath34 and the plummer - equivalent force softening is @xmath35 physical .",
    "elvis contains 48 dark - matter halos of masses similar to the mw or m31 ( @xmath36 ) , with a median @xmath37 .",
    "half of the halos are in a pair that resemble the masses , distance , and relative velocity of the mw ",
    "m31 pair , while the other half are single isolated halos .",
    "given the lack of systematic differences in satellite infall times for the paired versus isolated halos @xcite , we use all 48 to improve statistics .",
    "elvis identifies dark - matter ( sub)halos using the six - dimensional halo finder rockstar @xcite . for each halo , we assign a virial mass , @xmath38 , and radius , @xmath12 , according to @xcite .",
    "a `` subhalo '' is a halo whose center is inside @xmath12 of a more massive host halo , and a subhalo experiences `` first infall '' and becomes a `` satellite '' when it _ first _ passes within @xmath12 . for each subhalo , we compute the peak mass , @xmath39 , that it ever reached , and we assign @xmath4 to subhalos based on @xmath39 using the relation from abundance matching in @xcite , which reproduces the observed mass function in the lg if one accounts for observational incompleteness @xcite .    for more on elvis and its satellites infall times , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : quiescent_fraction ] shows , for all satellite galaxies at @xmath0 within @xmath1 of the mw or m31 , the fraction that are quiescent , in 1-dex bins of @xmath4 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not correct for observational completeness versus @xmath4 ( figure  [ fig : local_group ] ) , because we measure the relative fraction in each bin , which is likely unbiased .",
    "we show fractions for all satellites ( blue circles ) and separately for those in the mw ( violet squares ) and m31 ( green triangles ) halos .",
    "error bars show 68% uncertainty for the binomial counts using a beta distribution . of the 56 satellites , only 4 ( 7% ) are star - forming / gas - rich : lmc and smc of the mw , lgs 3 and ic 10 of m31 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath40 , only 1 ( lgs 3 ) of the 51 satellites is star - forming , and at @xmath41 _ all _ 40 satellites are quiescent .",
    "these near - unity quiescent fractions for satellites of the mw / m31 contrast strongly with the nearly _ zero _ quiescent fraction for isolated ( non - satellite ) galaxies at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the only clear exceptions are the quiescent galaxies kkr 25 ( @xmath42 ) and kks 3 ( @xmath43 ) at @xmath44 from the mw / m31 .",
    "( though , as figure  [ fig : local_group ] shows , the completeness distances at low @xmath4 leave open the possibility for more isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies . )",
    "we now translate the quiescent fractions in figure  [ fig : quiescent_fraction ] into the typical timescales over which environmental processes quenched satellites of the mw / m31 after they fell into a host halo , following the methodology of @xcite .",
    "first , motivated by the dearth of _ isolated _ galaxies with @xmath13 that are quiescent at @xmath45 , we assume that all satellites with @xmath46 were star - forming prior to first infall . however , we do not model @xmath47 , because cosmic reionization likely quenched most / all such galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath48 ,",
    "satellites star - formation histories show a mix of complete quenching by @xmath49 ( e.g. , bootes i , leo iv ) and signs of star formation at @xmath50 ( e.g. , and xi , and xii , and xvi ) @xcite , so quenching at these masses may arise from a mix of reionization and the host - halo environment .",
    "that said , the 100% quiescent fraction for satellites at this @xmath4 means that if both processes are responsible , both are highly efficient .",
    "furthermore , if the satellites that were quenched by reionization versus the host - halo environment have similar infall - time distributions , our modeling approach remains valid .",
    "thus , we include this @xmath4 but label it distinctly to emphasize caution in interpretation .    within each 1-dex bin of @xmath4",
    ", we use elvis to compute the distribution of infall times for satellites at @xmath51 .",
    "infall into the mw / m31 halo ( or any host halo ) typically occurred @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) ago , and our most massive satellites typically fell in @xmath54 more recently than our least massive ( see figures 1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that environmental quenching correlates with time since infall , we designate those that fell in earliest as having quenched , and we adjust the time - since - infall threshold for quenching until we match the observed quiescent fraction in each @xmath4 bin .",
    "several works have shown that this model successfully describes the dependence of satellite quiescent fractions on host - centric distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because infall time correlates with host - centric distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this correlation means that we must account for the distances of the observed satellites in computing their infall times .",
    "thus , in elvis we only select satellites out to the maximum host - centric distance that they are observed in each @xmath4 bin .",
    "this matters most at the highest @xmath4 , where all observed satellites ( m32 , ngc 205 , lmc / smc ) reside @xmath55 from the mw or m31 .",
    "figure  [ fig : quench_times ] shows the resultant environmental quenching timescales ( the time duration from first infall to being fully quiescent / gas - poor ) for satellites versus their @xmath4 ( or subhalo @xmath39 ) .",
    "blue circles show satellites in the mw and m31 , and we shade the lowest @xmath4 to highlight caution in interpretation because of reionization .",
    "we derive error bars from the 68% uncertainty in the observed quiescent fractions in figure  [ fig : quiescent_fraction ] .",
    "as explored in @xcite , many satellites first fell into a another host halo ( group ) , typically with @xmath56 , before falling into the mw / m31 halos .",
    "such groups may correspond to , for example , the lmc , as the newly discovered dwarf galaxies near the lmc @xcite suggest , although such groups disperse in phase space @xmath57 after mw / m31 infall @xcite , and typically half of such preprocessing hosts do not survive to @xmath51 @xcite , so preprocessed satellites are not always easily distinguishable .",
    "because the importance of this preprocessing in low - mass groups remains unclear , we present quenching timescales both neglecting ( left panel ) and including ( right panel ) group preprocessing .",
    "the latter results in longer quenching timescales , though it primarily shifts the upper tail of the distribution and not the median .    both panels show shorter median quenching timescales for less massive satellites : @xmath57 at @xmath58 , @xmath54 at @xmath59 , and @xmath60 at @xmath61 , depending on group preprocessing . moreover , the median timescale for two of the lowest @xmath4 bins is @xmath62 , because 100% of those satellites are quiescent , which implies extremely rapid quenching after infall .",
    "figure  [ fig : quench_times ] also shows infall / quenching timescales that are more directly measured for satellites of the mw . the 3-d orbital velocity measured for",
    "the lmc / smc strongly suggests that they are experiencing first infall and crossed inside @xmath12 of the mw @xmath63 ago @xcite .",
    "given that the lmc and smc remain star - forming , this places a lower limit to their quenching timescale ( gray triangle ) , consistent with our statistical timescales .",
    "similarly , measurements of the 3-d orbital velocity and star - formation history for leo i indicate that it fell into the mw halo @xmath64 ago and quenched @xmath65 ago ( near its @xmath66 pericentric passage ) , implying a quenching timescale of @xmath67 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gray pentagon ) , again consistent with our results .",
    "the mass trend in figure  [ fig : quench_times ] is broadly consistent the star - formation - history - based results of @xcite that more massive dwarf galaxies in the lg quenched more recently . also , the overall timescale is broadly consistent with @xcite , who inferred a typical quenching time since first _ pericenter _ of @xmath5 , which implies a quenching time since _ infall _ of @xmath68 , though they did not examine mass dependence .",
    "we also compare these timescales with previous results for more massive satellites of other hosts .",
    "figure  [ fig : quench_times ] ( green curve ) shows the quenching timescales for satellites in groups with @xmath69 from @xcite , who used identical methodology based on galaxies in sdss @xcite .",
    "( @xcite found similar timescales versus @xmath4 . )",
    "red squares show timescales from @xcite , who also used an sdss galaxy catalog @xcite and similar methodology for satellites with @xmath70 around hosts with @xmath71 , or @xmath72 , much more massive than the mw / m31 . both works measured satellite infall times , including group preprocessing , from cosmological simulations .",
    "the timescale changes rapidly between these works , from @xmath73 at @xmath74 to @xmath7 at @xmath75 . both analyses used similar galaxy catalogs and methodologies , though @xcite used a group catalog to narrow the masses of the hosts , which are more similar to the mw / m31 , while the hosts in @xcite are more massive , on average .",
    "thus , part of this change in timescale could arise if more massive hosts quench satellites with @xmath8 _ less _ rapidly .",
    "absent that , these results imply that the satellite quenching timescale rises rapidly near @xmath8 . furthermore , the timescale from @xcite implies some tension with our @xmath76 at @xmath77 , as driven by the higher quiescent fraction in the mw / m31 at this @xmath4 , specifically , ngc 205 and m32 , two quiescent satellites of m31 .",
    "this tension could be explained if ngc 205 and m32 both fell into the m31 halo unusually early ( @xmath78 ago ) , and/or ( again ) if m31 quenches its satellites more rapidly than the higher - mass ( @xmath79 ) host halos in @xcite .",
    "altogether , figure  [ fig : quench_times ] indicates a complex dependence of the satellite quenching timescale on @xmath4 .",
    "the typical timescale for satellites of the mw / m31 increases with @xmath4 , from @xmath80 at @xmath61 to @xmath57 at @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite indicates that this mass dependence continues , though with a rapid increase ( @xmath81 ) to @xmath7 , and no change from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "finally , @xcite shows that the timescale _ decreases _ near @xmath84 and continues to decline with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "overall , the typical satellite quenching timescale is shortest at lowest @xmath4 , short at the highest @xmath4 , and longest at @xmath8 , comparable to the magellanic clouds .",
    "we conclude by discussing the dependence of satellite quenching timescales on @xmath4 from figure  [ fig : quench_times ] in the context of the underlying physics .    at @xmath85 ,",
    "the long timescales suggests that satellite quenching is caused by gas depletion in the absence of cosmic accretion , via the stripping of extended gas around a satellite after infall ( `` strangulation '' ) .",
    "this scenario can explain shorter timescales at increasing @xmath4 , because higher-@xmath4 star - forming galaxies have lower @xmath86 ( in cold atomic and molecular gas , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus shorter gas depletion timescales in the absence of accretion .",
    "for example , @xcite found that isolated galaxies follow @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 have @xmath89 , with gas depletion timescales comparable to a hubble time .",
    "thus , satellite quenching timescales at @xmath85 do not necessarily _ require _ strong environmental processes beyond truncated gas accretion ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , at @xmath90 , internal feedback from stars and/or black holes also may quench satellites after infall , which could help explain the shortening of the timescale with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , strangulation can not explain the rollover in quenching times at @xmath0 , because the star - forming dwarf galaxies in the lg also have @xmath91 @xcite , enough to fuel star formation for a hubble time .",
    "thus , the rapid decline of the timescale at lower @xmath4 _ requires _ an additional process(es ) to remove gas from satellites after infall .",
    "this likely arises from increased efficiency of ram - pressure stripping in removing cold gas from such low - mass galaxies , which have shallower potential wells .",
    "moreover , the same internal stellar feedback that regulates the low star - formation efficiency in dwarf galaxies likely heats / drives significant cold gas to large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would assist such environmental stripping .",
    "thus , the rapid quenching timescales for dwarf galaxies may arise from the nonlinear interplay of both internal feedback and external stripping ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "overall , satellites with @xmath8 ( similar to magellanic clouds ) represent the transition between quenching via gas consumption and via gas stripping , and _ no _ quenching mechanism , either internal or external , appears to operate efficiently near this mass ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the above scenario may explain the curious similarity between the mass dependence of the quenching timescale in figure  [ fig : quench_times ] and the underlying galaxy - halo @xmath92 ratio , which also is small at both high and low @xmath4 and peaks at @xmath93 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , at high @xmath4 , the same physical process(es ) that lowers @xmath92 also lowers a galaxy s cold gas mass , which in turn causes more massive satellites to quench more rapidly , absent accretion . at low @xmath4 , the same shallower potential well that allows stellar feedback to lower @xmath92 also allows external stripping to occur more easily and thus quenching to occur more rapidly .    during preparation",
