    "the anapole moment is a characteristic of a system which is related to the toroidal magnetic field confined within the system .",
    "it was pointed out some time ago by zeldovich @xcite that the anapole moment is related to parity violation inside the system .",
    "interest in the nuclear anapole moment is mostly due to the fact that it gives dominating contribution to effects of atomic parity nonconservation ( pnc ) which depend on nuclear spin @xcite .",
    "there are two mechanisms that contribute to these effects .",
    "the first is due to exchange of a @xmath3-boson between electron and nucleus .",
    "the second mechanism is due to the usual magnetic interaction of an electron with the nuclear anapole moment .",
    "the contribution of the first mechanism is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "since sine squared of the weinberg angle is @xmath5 @xcite , the first mechanism is strongly suppressed and the second mechanism dominates .",
    "the anapole moment of @xmath6cs has been measured in an optical pnc experiment with atomic cs @xcite .",
    "this is the only observation of a nuclear anapole moment .",
    "there have been several different suggestions for measurements of nuclear anapole moments .",
    "measurements in optical transitions in atoms or in diatomic molecules remains an option , for a review see @xcite .",
    "another possibility is related to radiofrequency ( rf ) transitions in atoms or diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "possibilities to detect nuclear anapole moments using collective quantum effects in superconductors @xcite , as well as pnc electric current in ferromagnets @xcite , have been also discussed in the literature . a very interesting idea to use cs atoms trapped in solid",
    "@xmath7he has been recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our interest in the problem of the nuclear anapole moment in solids was stimulated by the recent suggestion for searches of electron electric dipole moment in rare earth garnets @xcite .",
    "garnets are very good insulators which can be doped by rare earth ions .",
    "they are widely used for lasers and their optical and crystal properties are very well understood . to be specific",
    "we consider two cases : the first is yttrium aluminium garnet ( yag ) doped by tm @xcite .",
    "thulium 3 + ions substitute for yttrium 3 + ions .",
    "the second case is yttrium gallium garnet doped by pr @xcite .",
    "once more , praseodymium 3 + ions substitute for yttrium 3 + ions .",
    "the dopant ions have an uncompensated electron spin @xmath8 and a nuclear spin @xmath9 . for tm@xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13tm , 100% abundance ) . for pr@xmath10 @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16pr , 100% abundance ) .",
    "the simplest @xmath17-odd and @xmath18-even correlation ( @xmath17 is space inversion and @xmath18 is time reflection ) which arises due to the nuclear anapole moment is @xmath19 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{e } , \\label{hdyni}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the external electric field .",
    "it is convenient to use the magnitude of the effect expected in the electron electric dipole moment ( edm ) experiment @xcite as a reference point . for this reference point",
    "we use a value of the electron edm equal to the present experimental limit @xcite , @xmath21 . according to our calculations , the value of the effective interaction ( [ hdyni ] ) is such that at the maximum possible value of the cross product @xmath22 $ ] it induces an electric field four orders of magnitude higher than the electric field expected in the edm experiment @xcite .",
    "for example , in pr@xmath23ga@xmath24o@xmath25 the field is @xmath26 .",
    "the problem is how to provide the maximum cross product @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "value of @xmath27 is proportional to the external magnetic field @xmath28",
    ". a magnetic field of about @xmath29@xmath30 is sufficient to induce the maximum magnetization .",
    "nuclear spins can be polarized in the perpendicular direction by an rf pulse , but then they will precess around the magnetic field with a frequency of about @xmath31 .",
    "it is not clear if the anapole - induced voltage of this frequency can be detected .",
    "an alternative possibility is to detect the static variation of the perpendicular magnetization induced by the external electric field , @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the magnetization effect for pr@xmath23ga@xmath24o@xmath25 is several times larger than that expected for the edm experiment @xcite .",
    "this probably makes the magnetization effect rather promising . in the present work we concentrate on the other possibility which is based on the crystal field of the lattice .",
    "because of the crystal field , the electron polarization of the rare earth ion has a component orthogonal to the magnetic field @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is some vector related to the lattice .",
    "the equilibrium orientation of the nuclear spin is determined by the direct action of the magnetic field together with the hyperfine interaction proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "because of the @xmath36 term in @xmath35 , the nuclear and the electron spins are not collinear , and the cross product @xmath22 $ ] is nonzero @xmath22\\propto ( \\boldsymbol{b}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{n } ) [ \\boldsymbol{b}\\times \\boldsymbol{n}]$ ] .",
    "we found that nmr frequency shift due to the correlation ( [ hdyni ] ) is about @xmath37 at @xmath1 and @xmath38 .",
    "in essence , we are talking about the correlation @xmath39\\cdot\\boldsymbol{e}$ ] considered previously in the work of bouchiat and bouchiat @xcite for cs trapped in solid @xmath7he .    another effect considered in the present work",
    "is the splitting of the nmr line into two lines due to the nuclear anapole moment .",
    "this effect is related to the lattice structure and is independent of the external electric field .",
    "the garnet lattice has a center of inversion .",
    "however , the environment of each rare earth ion is asymmetric with respect to inversion .",
    "one can imagine that there is a microscopic helix around each ion .",
    "since the lattice is centrosymmetric , each unit cell has equal numbers of rare earth ions surrounded by right and left helices ( there are 24 rare earth sites within the cell ) .",
    "the microscopic helix is characterized by a third rank tensor @xmath40 ( lattice octupole ) .",
    "together with the nuclear anapole interaction this gives a correlation similar to ( [ hdyni ] ) , but the effective `` electric field '' is generated now by the helix @xmath41 .",
    "so the effective interaction is @xmath42 the effective interaction ( [ hsti ] ) produces a shift of the nmr line .",
    "the value of the shift is about @xmath43 at @xmath38 , and the sign of the shift is opposite for sites of different `` helicity '' , so in the end it gives a splitting of the nmr line @xmath44 the value of the splitting depends on the orientation of the crystal with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "this is the `` handle '' which allows one to vary the effect .",
    "generically this effect is similar to the pnc energy shift in helical molecules @xcite .",
    "one can easily relate the values of the frequency shift in the external field ( [ d1 ] ) and of the line splitting ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "the splitting is due to internal atomic electric field which is about @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , naturally , it is about 5 orders of magnitude larger than the shift ( [ d1 ] ) in field @xmath46 .    for the present calculations we use the jelly model suggested in ref .",
    "values of the nuclear anapole moments of @xmath13tm and @xmath16pr which we use in the present paper have been calculated separately @xcite .",
    "the structure of the present paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii the crystal structure of the compounds under consideration is discussed . the effective potential method used in our electronic structure calculations",
    "is explained in section iii .",
    "the most important parts of the work which contain the calculations of the effective hamiltonians ( [ hdyni ] ) and ( [ hsti ] ) are presented in sections iv and v. the crystal field and the angle between the nuclear and the electron spin is considered in section vi . in section vii",
    "we calculate values of observable effects and section viii presents our conclusions .",
    "some technical details concerning the numerical solution of the equations for electron wave functions are presented in appendix .",
    "the compounds under consideration are ionic crystals consisting of y@xmath10 , o@xmath49 , ga@xmath10 ions for ygg and al@xmath10 instead of ga for yag , plus pr@xmath10 or tm@xmath10 rare - earth doping ions .",
    "the chemical formula of ygg is y@xmath23ga@xmath24o@xmath25 and the formula of yag is y@xmath23al@xmath24o@xmath25 .",
    "yttrium gallium garnet and yttrium aluminium garnet belong to the @xmath50 space group and contain 8 formula units per unit cell .",
