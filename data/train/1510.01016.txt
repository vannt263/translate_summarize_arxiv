    "the extension of thermodynamics from equilibrium to nonequilibrium states has been a goal for a long time , and several attempts to extend equilibrium thermodynamics to nonequilibrium steady states ( nesss ) have been made .",
    "one of these attempts is the extension of equilibrium thermodynamic functions to the nesss . for this purpose",
    ", the extension of thermodynamic relations was proposed to transition between two nesss @xcite .",
    "landauer tried to formulate thermodynamics far from equilibrium by taking part of the heat accompanied with the change in states @xcite . in a similar sprit , oono and paniconi proposed steady - state thermodynamics ( sst ) by adopting the  _ excess heat _ \" instead of the bare heat @xcite , in which the excess heat is proposed as the heat after subtracting the housekeeping heat for maintaining the steady state .",
    "sasa and tasaki have constructed their sst from a phenomenological point of view @xcite . taking heat - conducting or shared systems as examples",
    ", they argued that the local steady states differ from the local equilibrium states for the system in the thermodynamic limit . assuming the extensivity of the thermodynamic functions as is in equilibrium",
    ", they proposed their framework of sst .",
    "the proposed sst is rather powerful , as various equilibrium properties are kept , such as the convexity of the thermodynamic functions or the second law . by utilizing these aspects , they predicted what they call flux - induced osmosis , which has not been experimentally examined .    from a microscopic point of view ,",
    "hatano and sasa have derived a clausius - like inequality with their definition of the excess heat @xcite .",
    "the shannon entropy difference is connected to their excess heat in the quasistatic limit .",
    "their inequality is clear and mathematically rigorous ; however , their excess heat is rather difficult to access experimentally .",
    "moreover , their decomposition of the heat into the excess and housekeeping parts is applicable to a system described by even variables but not straightforwardly applied to a system with odd variables @xcite .",
    "that is , the two inequalities for the excess and housekeeping heats seem to be valid when the system s probability density is time - symmetric , whereas even the definition of the excess heat becomes unclear in a system with degrees of freedom for the momentum .",
    "komatsu et al .",
    "have derived another form of the clausius - like equality that holds in the quasistatic limit by defining the excess heat as the one after subtracting the expected steady heat currents at each moment @xcite .",
    "their equality holds regardless of the time symmetry of the probability density , and the entropy extended to the nesss is connected to the symmetric shannon entropy , which becomes different from the usual shannon entropy in a system with odd variables .",
    "their excess heat is experimentally observable and connected to an entropy in their clausius equality .",
    "when the probability density becomes time - symmetric , their excess heat can estimate the shannon entropy so that the equality has a correspondence with the quasistatic limit of the hatano - sasa equality . on the other hand ,",
    "since the definition of the excess heat is slightly different from the one of hatano and sasa , the clausius equality does not always have a corresponding inequality .",
    "we here raise questions about the proposed thermodynamic functions in these sst : how is the entropy extended to the nesss , or what kind of properties are kept or altered in the change from equilibrium to nonequilibirum ?",
    "is it related to the local equilibrium or the local steady states that sasa and tasaki assumed ? to examine such questions , we need to obtain experimental observations apart from the theoretical issues .",
    "we thus perform numerical experiments for the nesss in this study . noting experimental observability , we focus on the excess heat adopted by komatsu et al . and determine the entropy in the nesss according to their clausius relation .",
    "we then explore the basic properties of the entropy in the nesss and examine the validity of the assumptions by sasa and tasaki .",
    "we compare the numerically determined entropy with the one determined according to the local equilibrium hypothesis in order to examine the possibility of local steady states .    following this introduction",
    ", we summarize our numerical results for one - dimensional heat - conducting systems .",
    "first , we introduce an effective method to determine the entropy connected to the excess heat . comparing our numerically determined entropy with the entropy deduced from the local equilibrium hypothesis",
    ", we find a good correspondence between the two entropies .",
    "thus , we do not observe a difference between the local equilibrium and the local steady states .",
    "the correspondence is confirmed for systems in the thermodynamic limit and for those of rather small sizes .",
    "even though we can not solve the steady states for the systems of small sizes due to the complexity of the finite size effects , the entropy measured at the boundary of the system traces the steady states appropriately .",
    "next , we examined the extensivity and additivity of the obtained entropy and found that both the extensivity and additivity were maintained ; however , the obtained extensivity was different from the one assumed by sasa and tasaki in @xcite .",
    "the extensivity and additivity are not unified in the nesss , whereas the two properties are degenerated in equilibrium extensive systems . remembering that this degeneracy brings several powerful tools to the equilibrium thermodynamics",
    ", the sst based on the excess heat may not be so powerful as the equilibrium thermodynamics even though it reproduce the thermodynamics of the local equilibrium hypothesis .",

    "remembering that the heat conduction in the @xmath140 model is as normal as satisfying fourier s law , the scaling in would not hold in other realistic systems , regardless of the functional form of the heat conductivity .",
    "the scaling in does not hold , even if the conductivity is a constant independent of the temperature .    from the examination above",
    ", we realize the complexity of the extensivity and additivity in the nesss .",
    "this is in contrast to the equilibrium states , where the additivity is degenerate into the extensivity .",
    "the entropy for the heat - conducting states is characterized by its extensivity and additivity as well as the equilibrium states .",
    "however , the extensivity does not degenerate into the additivity .",
    "this is a significant difference between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium entropies .",
    "we performed numerical experiments to determine @xmath47 for the heat - conducting states in one - dimensional lattices exhibiting fourier s law .",
    "we discovered that @xmath47 connected to the excess heat currents coincides with @xmath139 determined according to the local equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "this coincidence indicates that the sst based on the excess heat are categorized as an inclusive description for the local equilibrium hypothesis .",
    "the major points of the former may be the wider applicability than the local equilibrium regardless of its complexity or size and the accessibility of the observable .",
    "note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 in are accessible in any system .",
    "what one should measure is the heat currents at the boundaries of the system , not the local quantities inside of the system , along the forward and backward protocols .",
    "our finding suggests that thermodynamic quantities consistent with the local equilibrium become experimentally studied , even for systems whose local states are not defined , not accessible , or greatly deviated from the thermodynamic limit .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the extensivity and additivity are degenerated and not distinguished .",
    "we confirmed that the two properties were extended to the heat - conducting states , but we simultaneously found a breakdown of the degeneration between the two properties .",
    "this raises the question of whether the conventional logic in thermodynamics can be applied to nonequilibirum thermodynamics .",
    "for instance , sasa and tasaki @xcite assumed the extensivity and additivity for the nesss to apply several powerful methods used in equilibriurm thermodynamics .",
    "since they do not seem to recognize the breakdown of the degeneration , their approach and predictions should be reconsidered . on the other hand ,",
    "the formulae for the additivity in and extensivity in are similar to those formulated by bodineau and derrida @xcite , which were introduced in the large deviation functional for the current fluctuations .",
    "their functional may be related to @xmath47 , even though the initial approach is different , .",
    "it may be possible to unify these two approaches , i.e. , the large deviation functionals and the operational relation .",
