    "one of the simplest assertions in mathematics , proposed by goldbach to euler in 1742 , the goldbach s conjecture ( gc ) , also called strong gc , establishes in its simplest form that even numbers greater than @xmath0 are always written as a sum of two prime numbers .",
    "if we go from the first term , @xmath1 , to a given intenger @xmath2 , that corresponds to a term of type @xmath3 , we have finite gc sequences ( gcs ) .",
    "it is an open problem to prove that such gc is valid for an arbitrary sequence , i.e. , for any integer @xmath4 , although there was not found any exception @xcite .",
    "the main point in this problem is dealing with an infinity of even numbers and a corresponding infinity of prime numbers , i.e. , to prove that there is no exception for any even number . from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ,",
    "any natural number @xmath5 can be written as a product of primes @xmath6 , for a given @xmath2 , @xmath7 and , in particular , it is also proved that there is an infinity of primes , since @xmath8 can not be completelly divided by @xmath6 , i.e , there is a remainder @xmath9 . since cantor @xcite , we know that there are many types of infinity and that the infinity associated the sets of even numbers , natural numbers and prime numbers have the same cardinality @xmath10 . as in the example of other mathematical problems @xcite , we know that there is advantage in writing the mathematical problem in a way to make use of the advances in quantum algorithms , what can be useful for a quantum computer processing . as such , we can reexpress the gc problem quantum mechanically , looking for quantum algorithms to write such sequences in order to achieve an arbitrarily large gcs . from the fundamental point of view the states associated to gcs",
    "can also be connected in important question of physical interest @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we consider the problem associated to the generation of gcs in quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider sequences involving fock states and consider their equivalency to the gcs .",
    "we show that there is a correspondence between the gcs and expectation values of the number operator in fock states . from the experimental point of view",
    ", fock states can be created in many different quantum systems @xcite and are , consequently , adequate for the problem in view .",
    "we demonstrate that depending on the normalization or not of the superpositions of fock states , we can generate sequences that are equivalent and sequences that are not equivalent to the gcs . in order to circumvent the problem related to the normalization",
    ", we propose an algorithm to generate a sequence involving expectation values with normalized states that is equivalent to gcs .",
    "we also propose states associated to gcs that generate all gc terms by means of projection relations and consider their association to the hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "we show how these states are related to eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator and how the hamiltonian acts on them . considering fock states directly associated to the gcs , we disscuss its role in the spectrum of the quantum harmonic oscillator and association to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "finally , we address the degeneracy problems related to states associated to gcs .",
    "we first restrict ourselves to fock states @xmath11 , with integers @xmath4 , that fulfill an eigenvalue equation for the number operator @xmath12 , given by @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that these states can be generated from the vacuum @xmath14 by means of repetitive actions of the creation operator @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the expectation value of the number operator in the pure the fock state @xmath17 is then just @xmath18 .",
    "we are also interested in superpositions of fock states , that can also be generated from the vacuum by means of two different actions of the creation operator in a superposition of two orthonormal states @xmath19 where @xmath20 is due to the normalization factor .",
    "a special type of superposition is latexmath:[$|k\\rangle +    account the normalization , this state is equivalet to @xmath17 , with the denormalization factor @xmath0 .",
    "usually , such superpositions are not a new state , in particular @xmath17 and @xmath22 correspond to the same physical state .    in the case of the superpostion state @xmath23",
    ", we have , in the unormalized case , @xmath24and for the normalized superpositions @xmath25where @xmath26 is a sum of the integer numbers @xmath2 and @xmath27 .",
    "let us first consider non - normalized states .",
    "we proceed to the correspondence with the gcs defined by means of @xmath28-terms , for @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath5 is not prime @xmath30 and if @xmath5 is a prime @xmath31 @xmath32 the corresponding gcs in terms of expectation values of the number operator is described by means of the following sets of equations : if @xmath29 is not a prime number , latexmath:[\\ ] ] the sequences @xmath92 are then associated to states of excitations in the harmonic oscillator and are equivalent to the gcs @xmath28 .",
    "we can also consider the states @xmath93 and @xmath94 , that are associated as component terms in gcs .",
    "these states have particular eigenstates in an harmonic oscilator @xmath95 and @xmath96|2n - ( p_{1 } + p_{2})\\rangle.\\ ] ] as a consequence the gc terms are associated to the same spectrum in the hamiltonian . in the case of the state @xmath94 , the gc will be associated to the vacuum state @xmath97 , as such their energies are vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the gc problem can be seen as a question about mapping .",
    "we can divide positive integers in even numbers @xmath98 and odd numbers @xmath99 . considering an even number @xmath98 , if @xmath5 is prime , then we just multiply by @xmath51 and get the gcs @xmath100 , as discussed above . if @xmath5 is not prime , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are two different prime numbers , the form @xmath103 is applied .",
    "this discussion can also be started from the prime numbers .",
    "let @xmath101 and @xmath102 be odd prime numbers , i. e. , different from @xmath0 .",
    "their sum then is even , consequently @xmath104 on the other hand , let one of the numbers be @xmath0 , then the sum is odd , @xmath105 consequently , the set of the numbers in the gc is a subset of even numbers .",
    "let us call the set of even numbers @xmath106 .",
    "the set of gcs will be given by given by @xmath107 since all these sums are even , we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the set @xmath110 without the number @xmath0 .",
    "but if the gc goes to all even numbers , we have to prove there is a surjective ( onto ) map @xmath111 this accounts for the correspondence to generate all gcs .",
    "although this is a problem in the infinity case , for a finite gcs it can be completely constructed for an arbitrarily large @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath112 be a set with even numbers until @xmath98 , excluding @xmath0 , i. e. , @xmath113 .",
    "let @xmath114 be a finite sequence of gc terms until @xmath67 , @xmath113 .",
    "as an example , @xmath115 the goldbach partition imply that a given even number can have different ways to be written as a sum of prime numbers .",
    "we can define the following sets @xmath116 the onto maps @xmath117 relating the sets @xmath112 and @xmath114 , @xmath118 .",
    "examples of these maps are showed in the figures [ c21 ] and [ c100 ] .    , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "]    . ]     and @xmath122 . ]",
    "the onto functions @xmath117 and @xmath122 are related by the fact that the gc term @xmath123 is included in @xmath117 to generate @xmath122 . as such",
    ", the onto functions can be built recursivelly from @xmath98 to @xmath123 , as showed in the figure [ c123 ] .",
    "the sets @xmath124 associated to the gc tersm are related to the gcs sets @xmath114 by means of the following relation @xmath125 due the equivalence with the sets associated to quantum states , we can derive equivalent onto maps : @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128",
    "we have demonstrated that a sequence @xmath35 in terms of expectation values of number operators in fock states has a direct correspondence to the gcs @xmath63 . on the other hand , taking into account the normalization of fock states , we have generated a new sequence @xmath129 that is no more equivaltent to @xmath63 .",
    "we propose an algorithm based on properties of fock states , leading to a sequence @xmath62 in terms of expectation values , involving only normalized states and equivalent to the gcs @xmath63 .",
    "we showed that this algorithm , involving a canonical transformation in the hamiltonian , solves the previous problem of factor @xmath0 in the sequence @xmath129 .",
    "we also proposed an alternative procedure , by deriving states associated to the gcs making use of projection relations . in this form",
    ", we showed that the correspondence to the gcs can also be realized by means of defined quantum states @xmath130 and @xmath131 , without problems with normalization .",
    "we derived relations of these states with eigenstates of an harmonic oscillator and the action of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "we also have showed that fock states @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 directly relate the gcs to the spectrum an harmonic oscillator .",
    "finally , we addressed the problem of degeneracy associated to goldbach partitions and discussed onto maps that build gcs at arbitrary size . using the equivalence with the sets relating quantum states , we also showed that such maps can be established using quantum states .",
    "this possibility implies that gcs can be generated in different physical implementations , in particular cases where fock states can be completelly controlled , as quantum optical systems .",
