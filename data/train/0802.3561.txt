    "the compact radio source sagittarius ( sgr ) a * at the galactic center is associated with a @xmath0 supermassive black hole @xcite and is one of the best astrophysical sources for studying physics of black hole accretion .",
    "since the discovery of active galactic nuclei and galactic x - ray binaries , it has been suggested that black hole accretion be responsible for the high luminosity and radiation efficiency of these sources . to release the gravitational energy of materials falling into black holes ,",
    "the angular momentum must be transported to large radii in the accretion processes .",
    "the nature of the viscosity responsible for the angular momentum transport and energy dissipation is not well understood .",
    "@xcite proposed that the viscous stress is induced by turbulence and is proportional to the pressure of the accretion flow .",
    "mhd simulations have made the magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) the primary mechanism for generation of turbulence and viscous stress in accretion flows @xcite . although there are indications that the viscous stress is proportional to the magnetic field energy density , the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the gas pressure depends on the initial magnetic field configurations of these simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that , at least for some astrophysical accretion systems , the mri may not be able to generate high enough viscosity to account for the observations .",
    "nevertheless , the mri is believed to play dominant roles in some black hole accretion systems .",
    "it has been studied extensively through mhd simulations and is awaiting observational test .",
    "sgr a * plays a crucial role in this aspect . since discovered in 1974",
    "@xcite , the source has been observed extensively due to its association with the supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "radio imaging reveals a compact radio source with its intrinsic size marginally uncovered in the millimeter ( mm ) band @xcite .",
    "the centimeter ( cm ) spectrum can be fitted with a power - law function , and there is clear evidence for a mm and sub - mm spectral bump @xcite .",
    "radio ( @xmath1 ghz ) emission of sgr a * has unusual polarization characteristics with no detection ( @xmath2 ) of linear polarization ( lp ) and weak circular polarization ( cp ) of up to @xmath3 in the quiescent - state @xcite .",
    "weak lp ( @xmath4 ) was detected recently at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ghz during radio outbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a mean lp of @xmath7 at @xmath8 mm . in the sub - mm band ,",
    "high lp of @xmath9 has been routinely measured @xcite without any firm indication of detectable cp @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that sgr a * is powered by accretion of the supermassive black hole with the mm and sub - mm emission originating within 10 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 $ ] cm is the schwarzschild radius for a non - spinning black hole with mass @xmath12 .",
    "the high lp implies a very low accretion rate @xcite .",
    "based on the mri , a small ( @xmath13 ) accretion torus can account for the spectrum and polarization of the sub - mm emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite , hereafter l07 , recently generalize the model to a two - temperature mri driven accretion flow , which naturally explains the 90@xmath14 flip between the electric vector position angles ( evpa ) of the polarized sub - mm and near - infrared ( nir ) emissions @xcite . besides the basic parameters related to the mri , the model introduces only one more parameter to characterized the not - well - understood electron heating processes .",
    "however , all models proposed so far have ignored the birefringence effects of synchrotron radiation propagating through the relativistic accretion flow in sgr a * and have treated the general relativistic ( gr ) effects with simplified disk structures .",
    "the faraday rotation of the birefringence effects can depolarize low frequency emission , and the gr light bending effect can complicate the transfer of polarized emission near the black hole . based on the model proposed by l07 , in this letter we present a more complete and self - consistent treatment of radiation from the relativistic accretion flow.the ratio of the magnetic field to gas pressure , emission spectrum , and polarization are very sensitive to the onset frequency of lp from the cm to mm bands , electron heating rate , and disk inclination angle , respectively .",
    "a fitting to these observations leads to unique images of fractional lp and cp .",
    "the combined effects of gr and birefringence produce distinct lp and cp features between the sub - mm and nir bands .",
    "these predictions can be tested with future polarimetric vlbi observations .",
    "more importantly , in combination with mhd simulations , observations of sgr a * can be used to test the mri . in   [ method ] , we briefly discuss our treatment of the transfer of polarized synchrotron radiation near a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "our main results are presented in   [ result ] .",
    "we draw conclusions and propose future work in   [ cd ] .",
    "following @xcite , hereafter ll04 , we defined four vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 to treat the transfer of polarized emission in a magnetized plasma . here , @xmath17 represents three normalized stokes parameters @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath16 correspond to three normalized emission coefficients @xmath20 , absorption coefficients @xmath21 , and faraday conversion and rotation @xmath22 , respectively . for the total specific intensity @xmath23 , the corresponding emission and average absorption coefficients are indicated by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . then we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance along a light ray .",
    "synchrotron radiation is elliptically polarized with a dominant extraordinary emission component , whose electric field is perpendicular to both the magnetic field vector and the wave propagation direction , and the emission coefficients satisfy @xmath28 @xcite . in the coordinate system with the ordinary and extraordinary components as the axes , the @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) components of @xmath31 , and @xmath16 vanish , and @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 correspond to the faraday conversion and rotation coefficients , respectively ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m97;km98 ) .",
    "we use formulas of @xcite to obtain @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath25 and @xmath37 can be derived from the kirchhoff s law .",
    "the polarization of the natural wave modes of a magnetized plasma determines @xmath16 .",
    "because there are no birefringence effects for the natural wave modes , @xmath16 needs to be parallel to @xmath36 ( m97 ; km98 ; ll04 ) . for the thermal plasmas we are interested in here ,",
    "m97 has given expressions for the faraday rotation coefficients in cold and relativistic limits .",
    "we extrapolate these results @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are the electron charge , mass , temperature , density , boltzmann constant , speed of light , magnetic field , angle between the magnetic field and wave propagation direction , and wave frequency , respectively .",
    "the faraday conversion coefficient is then given by @xmath48 .",
    "we simulate the pseudo - newtonian disk structure in a schwarzschild metric with all quantities treated as measured by a locally static observer .",
    "because the emission frequencies in the mm to nir bands are much higher than the cyclotron and plasma frequencies of the thermal electrons in the accretion flow , the plasma effects on photon propagation discussed by @xcite can be neglected and all photons travel along the null geodesics . to perform",
    "the above radiation transfer of polarized synchrotron emission with the ray - tracing code discussed in @xcite , one only needs to take into account the rotation of evpa along a null geodesic due to the space curvature @xcite .",
    "the effects of magnetic field and gr have been taken care of in the radiation transfer equations @xcite .",
    "mhd simulations of the mri show that the magnetic field is dominated by its azimuthal component due to the shearing of the keplerian accretion flow .",
    "previous modeling of the sub - mm to nir polarizations of sgr a * assumed that the magnetic field does not have other components , see in @xcite;l07 .",
    "here we consider two more realistic configurations : one with the magnetic and velocity field parallel to each other in the upper half of the disk and anti - parallel in the lower half , and the other with the magnetic field direction just reversed .",
    "the averaged stokes parameters of these two configurations are used to fit observations . sgr",
    "a * is highly variable with variation timescales decreasing with observing frequency . in mm and sub - mm",
    "bands , both flux and lp vary on hourly timescales @xcite , while the accretion timescale near the black hole is a few days .",
    "shorter timescale variations are likely associated with turbulent fluctuations in the accretion flow , which may be addressed with mhd simulations .",
    "the results of our stationary accretion model should be compared with measurements averaged over days .",
    "the thick solid lines in fig.[spec](a ) and ( b ) represent the best fit to the spectrum and polarization data of sgr a*. the data points are summarized in l07 , except the two cp measurements at @xmath49 ghz @xcite and @xmath50 ghz @xcite .",
    "we fit the data around mm to sub - mm bump , including the evpas at @xmath51 ghz averaged over five epochs in 2004 @xcite , and at @xmath52 ghz that remained unchanged during observations from 2002 october to 2004 january @xcite . in our fitting , neither the nir measurement @xcite nor the detected lp at @xmath6 and @xmath5 ghz @xcite is used simply because these are related to flaring activity .",
    "however , the evpa at @xmath53 m remained unchanged from 2004 to 2006 and may be explained by a temporary disk with toroidal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the corresponding five model parameters are the ratio of viscous stress to magnetic field energy density @xmath54 , the ratio of magnetic field energy density to gas pressure @xmath55 , the electron heating rate indicated by the dimensionless parameter @xmath56 , the accretion rate @xmath57 yr@xmath58 , and the inclination angle of the accretion flow @xmath59 .",
    "the most prominent gr effect is the amplification of the emission area due to the light bending near the black hole ( see fig.[image ] ) . at higher frequencies",
    "the disk becomes optically thin and lower frequency emission is produced at relatively larger radii , so the flux density enhancement by the gr effects is significant near the spectral peak and vanishes in the low and high frequency limits as can be seen by comparing with the thin solid line of the pseudo - newtonian spectrum .",
    "the gr effects also change the lp .",
    "the thin solid line in fig.[spec](b ) shows the corresponding pseudo - newtonian result .",
    "the lp is significantly suppressed ( @xmath4 ) by birefringence effects at low frequencies .",
    "another radio component introduced by l07 , which is presumably associated with an outflow , may fit the cm cp and flux density spectra @xcite and explain the polarization observed during radio outbursts @xcite .",
    "the dotted line shows the gr calculation without the birefringence effects , i.e. @xmath60 .",
    "we see that there is a weak level of lp ( @xmath61 ) at low frequencies .",
    "the birefringence effects reduce the lp in mm and sub - mm bands by up to @xmath62 . at very high frequencies ,",
    "the birefringence effects are weak and the results approach that of the fiducial model .",
    "as shown by l07 , the flux density is very sensitive to the electron heating rate @xmath63 , which determines the electron temperature profile .",
    "however , the fitting to the emission spectrum does nt give a unique set of model parameters .",
    "with the additional lp measurements , the best fit model parameters can be fixed .",
    "this is because the synchrotron emissivity is proportional to @xmath64 while the faraday rotation measure is proportional to @xmath65 , for a @xmath64 constrained by the emission spectrum , the faraday rotation increases with the decrease of @xmath45 , which is determined by @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the onset frequency of lp increases with the decrease of @xmath66 .",
    "the two magnetic field configurations give almost identical lp but different evpa and cp .",
    "so we plot only one lp [ dashed line in fig.[spec](b ) ] but two sets of evpa and cp [ dashed lines in fig.[spec](c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the average of stokes parameters over the two configurations reduces the lp .",
    "one may use the difference between the average and individual configurations to estimate the variability of the corresponding quantities .",
    "the most interesting prediction of our model is oscillations of lp and cp with frequency @xmath67 thz ( see fig.[spec ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of gr and birefringence . since @xmath68 ,",
    "the birefringence effects are negligible @xmath69 thz .",
    "the modulation of lp and cp by the birefringence is amplified by the gr effect @xmath67 thz , where @xmath70 is on the order of @xmath71 .",
    "the lp oscillates with the amplitude and period decreasing due to rapid increase of the faraday rotation angle as frequency decreases , in contrast to the pseudo - newtonian and no - birefringence gr cases .",
    "this effect also gives rise to high cp of @xmath72 for each individual magnetic field configurations .",
    "future polarization observations should be able to easily test these predictions .",
    "the model predicted intrinsic evpa flips by @xmath73 three times from cm to nir bands .",
    "the flip at @xmath74 ghz is related to the fact that the red - shifted side of the keplerian flow becomes transparent and strongly polarized in the direction perpendicular to thedisk axis . at @xmath75 ghz",
    ", the near and far sides also become transparent and dominate the lp .",
    "the evpa flips to be roughly aligned with the disk axis . at @xmath76 thz , the polarized emission is dominated by the blue - shifted side and the evpa flips again . without introducing an external faraday rotation measure , the range limited by the two configurations fits the evpa measurements well .",
    "the corresponding position angle of the disk axis is @xmath77 , which is different from that inferred from the nir flare observations @xcite and the pseudo - newtonian model ( l07 ) .",
    "the fitting to the evpa can be improved with an external rotation measure @xcite , which also brings the evpa of the disk axis in agreement with the pseudo - newtonian model .",
    "similar to the pseudo - newtonian case , the lp and evpa flips are very sensitive to the inclination angle of the disk . in practice",
    ", cases with inclination angles ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath79 can fit the spectrum and lp within error bars .",
    "the best fit evpa of @xmath80 is @xmath81 smaller than the pseudo - newtonian result .",
    "nearly edge - on @xmath82 cases overestimate the lp in the sub - mm band and fail to produce a @xmath83 evpa flip from sub - mm to nir bands because the near side of the torus dominates the emission .",
    "fig.[image ] shows the intrinsic polarimetric images of the fiducial model at 230 ghz with the disk axis in the vertical direction .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are the images of the total specific intensity @xmath23 , fractional lp ( @xmath84 ) , fractional cp ( @xmath85 ) , and the residual ( @xmath86 ) of the faraday rotation angle @xmath87 divided by @xmath88 , respectively . results shown in fig.[spec ] are obtained by integrating the stokes parameters over the disk to compare with spatially unresolved observations .",
    "doppler boosting enhances @xmath23 on the left hand side of fig.[image](a ) .",
    "the white dashes in fig.[image](b ) represent the intrinsic evpa of each ray . in fig.[image](c ) positive ( red ) and negative ( black ) values of cp correspond to right and left hand polarization , respectively ) is consistent with the ieee definition which has been adopted by the iau and used by many observations , i.e. , right hand polarization corresponds to the electric vector of an approaching wave rotating counter - clockwise . ] .",
    "the strips in fig.[image](b ) and ( c ) are clearly correlated with the faraday conversion shown in fig.[image](d ) . in our case",
    ", the faraday conversion coefficient is always much greater than the faraday rotation coefficient , and its integrations along the rays are much larger than @xmath88 at 230 ghz , the stokes @xmath89 therefore changes its sign over one period of evpa rotation ( km98 ; ll04 ) .",
    "the strips will be less distinct in a realistic turbulent flow .",
    "the observed images will always be smoothed by finite spatial resolutions and interstellar scattering effects @xcite .",
    "however , rough contours may be resolved by future polarization - sensitive vlbi observations since the scattering effect is less important in sub - mm band .",
    "the black hole shadow may be detected in the @xmath23 image , as evidence for the gr theory .",
    "we also expect high levels of lp with the evpa mostly in the radial direction , as evidence for toroidal component dominated magnetic fields .",
    "tremendous efforts have been put to image shadows caused by the strong gravity of black holes @xcite .",
    "sgr a * has been the best candidate for such studies .",
    "the polarization measurements of sgr a * have put strong constraints on the physical processes near the black hole . based on the two - temperature mri driven keplerian accretion model , which has only five parameters",
    ", we calculate the synchrotron emission from the accretion flow with both the gr and birefringence effects taken into account self - consistently .",
    "the model can reproduce the spectrum and polarization of sgr a * in mm and shorter wavelength bands and further predicts distinct lp and cp at @xmath67 thz .",
    "polarimetric images of the relativistic accretion flow of the best fit model are made , which can be verified with future polarization - sensitive vlbi observations .",
    "the mri has become the leading mechanism for the generation of viscous stress required to drive the accretion flow of plasmas into black holes .",
    "the theory has been well established through both theoretical analyses and numerical investigations .",
    "the model presented here makes it possible for the first time to put the theory into observational tests .",
    "if the scaling laws for the mri discovered by @xcite are applicable to the accretion flow in sgr a * , the fiducial model parameter @xmath90 requires the alfvn velocity induced by the large scale vertical magnetic field be @xmath91 times smaller than the sound velocity . with this large scale magnetic field configuration",
    ", one can carry out gr mhd simulations for sgr a * @xcite .",
    "the outflows from these simulations should not only reproduce low frequency radio flux , cp , and source size measurements , but also induce a faraday rotation measure external to the disk studied here , which can improve the fit to the observed evpas in mm and sub - mm bands .",
    "nir and x - ray flares and the high variability of this source , which can not be studied with the current model , may also be addressed with such simulations @xcite .",
