    "since its birth in the early 80 s  @xcite , the near - field scanning optical microscope , or nsom  @xcite , became a versatile tool for imaging optical properties of systems requiring a very high spatial resolution in the nanometer range  @xcite .",
    "yet one of the most fundamental issue with nsom concerns the optical resolution available with a given system .",
    "current systems based on aperture - nsom  @xcite with a hole at the apex of a metal - coated conical tip are fundamentally limited by the size of the optical hole  @xcite . in order to improve the optical resolution of nsom and",
    "therefore overcome this limitation one could ideally use a point - like emitting source .",
    "recently , inspired by the pioneer work by michaelis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who used a fluorescent single molecule at low temperature as basis for a nsom , we developed a new high - resolution nsom tip using a nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) color - center in a diamond nanocrystal as a scanning point - like light source  @xcite . in this active tip",
    "the 20 nm nanocrystal is glued _ in situ _ at the apex of an etched optical fiber probe .",
    "importantly , the nv center acts as a photostable ( no blinking , no bleaching ) single - photon source working at room temperature  @xcite . as",
    "such , the nv - center based tip proves superior to quantum - dot based tips  @xcite , which suffer from unsufficient photostability  @xcite , and to insulating - nanoparticle based tips , which , despite remarkable photostability , can not ( yet ) reach the single - photon emission rate  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nanodiamond - based nsom probe opens large avenues for microscopy and quantum optics in the near - field regime .",
    "+ in the present work we study theoretically the potential resolution offered by the nanodiamond - based nsom tip that we assimilate to a point - like emitter and we compare it with the resolution of a standard aperture - tip . for this we will first describe simple electromagnetic models for both the point - like ( sections ii ) and the aperture ( section iii ) optical probes . in section",
    "ii we return to and justify some of our assumptions concerning the photon emission by the nv - center based nsom and we discuss in more detail the impact of quantum optics on the optical resolution of this system . finally , in section iv we apply and compare these models for simulating an image acquisition during a scan over fluorescent test systems .",
    "the concept of optical resolution is at the heart of any photonic microscopy  @xcite . as it is well known the resolving power of classical microscopy , that is the ability to separate spatially two point - like objects , is limited to spatial separations @xmath0 larger than half the illumination wavelength : @xmath1 .",
    "fundamentally this is due to the fact that far - field microscopy collects only propagative waves for imaging . in other words ,",
    "the microscope acts as a low - pass filter for the incident field plane wave expansion since only wavevectors with planar components satisfying @xmath2 contribute to the image reconstruction .",
    "this leads to a fourier - heisenberg like uncertainty relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 and thus to the rayleigh - abbe criterion  @xcite : @xmath1 .",
    "+ near- field optical microscopes circumvent this limitation by including the neglected components with @xmath6 in the imaging procedure  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in nsom in the illumination configuration  @xcite a tip - probe is brought into the vicinity of the structure to be observed , i.e. , at a distance much smaller than the optical illumination wavelength @xmath7 nm .",
    "evanescent components of the emitted light ( the so - called near - field contributions ) are used to resolve spatially the objects on the surface . a different way to see this is to use a multipolar expansion of the field around the tip apex .",
    "it is widely accepted that this field is well described by the dominant ( electric and magnetic ) dipolar terms .",
    "for example , the electromagnetic field @xmath8 , @xmath9 of such an ( harmonic ) electric point - like dipole term @xmath10 calculated at position @xmath11 and time @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the location of the point dipole , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the dyadic green propagator of the dipole @xcite in vacuum which reads @xmath17g^{0}_{\\omega}(|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|)=\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times ( \\mathbf{i}g^{0}_{\\omega}(|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0|))$ ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the diagonal kronecker tensor .",
    "the dipolar field can explicitly be written  @xcite ( in heaviside - lorentz units ) as @xmath20\\left(\\frac{1}{4\\pi r^{3}}-\\frac{ik}{4\\pi r^{2}}\\right)e^{ik(r - ct ) } & \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "+ it is easily seen that in the near - field regime where @xmath22 we have the asymptotic behavior : @xmath23\\frac{1}{4\\pi r^{3 } } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] this electric near - field , which is clearly highly localized around the dipole ( with @xmath24 ) , is actually responsible for the super resolution offered in the near - field by the ideal point - like source considered here .",
    "+ in the nanodiamond - based nsom probe  @xcite , the optical behavior originates from the point - like transition dipole associated with the radiative transition of the nv color - center .",
    "we here neglect the finite extension of the host nanocrystal since current trends in nanodiamond processing indicate that it can be diminished down to a few nms only  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect the point - like model outlined above to apply to this tip and we will indeed describe the nanodiamond - based tip as a single point - like dipole .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the nsom experiments reported in @xcite involves a single nanodiamond containing one and only one fluorescent quantum emitter i.e. a nv center .",
    "this point is of general importance for the present discussion since such a quantum object acts like a single - photon source emitting photon one by one in the typical lifetime of the ( two - level ) optical transition @xmath25 ns  @xcite . in particular , we already pointed out @xcite that such a nv - based nsom constitutes ultimately a near - field scanning single - photon microscope . to justify this point",
    "it is sufficient to note that @xmath26 corresponds to a length scale of 3 m , i.e. , to a size which is by order of magnitudes larger than any device scales in nano and microphotonics .",
    "therefore , we can fairly state that during this lifetime unit scale there is only one photon created by the quantum emitter in the whole imaged photonic system .",
    "+ the question which naturally arises concerns the implication of quantum optics on the concept of optical resolution since we know that in quantum optics electromagnetic field components are associated with non commuting operators . actually , heisenberg  @xcite already attempted in the 1930 s to introduce some limitations in the measurability of electromagnetic field quantities in a similar way to that he used for deriving the well known uncertainty relation for complementary kinematic variables such as position and momentum .",
    "the argumentation was however criticized by landau and peierls  @xcite who demonstrated that further restrictions in quantum field theory were necessary .",
    "this point was later clarified by bohr and rosenfeld in a well known paper  @xcite where they showed that the method chosen for measuring the fields ( and in particular the space and time averaging process ) is the key issue  @xcite .",
    "recently , the problem has gained a renewed interest in the context of nano - optics  @xcite ( see also @xcite for important related topics ) .",
    "more precisely , starting from the heisenberg uncertainty relation  @xcite which links through a circular permutation the components of the electric field @xmath27 and magnetic field @xmath28 averaged in a cubic volume @xmath29 @xmath30 it was deduced that in the context of nsom , measurements of the fields and of the energy should become uncertain  @xcite ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "this is because volumes much smaller than the optical wavelength ( cubed ) are probed .",
    "as any nsom experiment ultimately involves a detection of photons one could therefore suspect a supplementary and purely quantum alteration of the optical resolution . here , we show however that eq .  4 does not actually limit the resolution of the nv - based nsom . to see why this is",
    "the case we must go back to the dynamics of the nv center assimilated with a two - level fluorescent system .",
    "we have in particular to justify some assumptions done in the previous subsection about the use of classical formulas for the electromagnetic field generated by the nv center .      as a first approach it is enough to consider a model of the photon emission based on the wigner - weisskopf theory for a two - level point - like radiating system  @xcite . rigorously speaking we would need to use quantum electrodynamics for a transition dipole located in a inhomogeneous dispersive and dissipative dielectric ( or metallic ) environment",
    "this would imply including the degree of freedom of the polarizable medium in the hamiltonian treatment of the problem .",
    "for the present purpose we choose a simplified configuration and consider the emission in vacuum only . following this model the two - level system",
    "initially in the excited quantum state @xmath31 ( with energy @xmath32 ) at @xmath33 spontaneously relaxes with a typical rate @xmath34 to the ground state @xmath35 ( with energy @xmath36 ) . at any time @xmath37 the whole quantum system involving photon and emitter is in an entangled state which can formally be written @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are respectively the vacuum electromagnetic state and the single - photon state at time @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , @xmath41 is a complex valued amplitude coefficient depending on time and we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the lamb - shift , and @xmath45 is the heaviside unit step function .",
    "the dissipation constant is given by the usual formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transition dipole amplitude .",
    "this naturally leads to the usual exponential probability rule for `` non - decay ''",
    "we also define a ground state @xmath49 such as @xmath50 as expected ( i.  e. , the ground state is stable ) .",
    "now , using the total power - zienau hamiltonian operator for the interacting system field plus a two - level system in the dipolar approximation  @xcite @xmath51 we obtain ( in the heisenberg picture ) the quantum - maxwell equations @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the dipole moment heisenberg operator for the point - like source located at @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath54 , and @xmath55 are electromagnetic field heisenberg operators .",
    "+ in the context of glauber theory of photo - detection  @xcite the most relevant quantities are the transition amplitudes @xmath56 with similar mathematical expressions for @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is a destruction operator in the schrdinger representation , i.e. , the positive frequency part operator  @xcite ) .",
    "we also introduce the transition dipole volume density @xmath60 all these ( complex valued ) quantities obey rigorously to the same maxwell equations as defined in eq .  7 and therefore the space time evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 is identical to the one associated with the classical ( complex ) maxwell field generated by a classical oscillating and damped point - like dipole @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "in particular the electric field is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the fourier transform of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "using the definition @xmath66 we then get @xmath67 this retarded field reads explicitly @xmath68\\left(\\frac{1}{4\\pi",
    "r^{3}}-\\frac{i\\omega_{0}/c}{4\\pi r^{2}}\\right)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ \\cdot e^{-i\\omega_{0}(t - r / c)}\\theta(t - r / c)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is mathematically equivalent to the classical formula eq .  2 after substituting @xmath69 and multiplying by the step function .",
    "we can therefore state that in our model there is no special feature of the resolution involving quantum optics which can not already be explained using classical or semiclassical physical arguments .",
    "remark that our assumptions concerning the dipole in vacuum are not fundamental for our reasoning .",
    "indeed , in presence of a dielectric medium the classical analogy is still valid and one only must substitute the dyadic green function @xmath16 for a dipole in vacuum by the total green function @xmath70 including the reflectivity of the surrounding environment  @xcite .",
    "this will be used in section iv .",
    "it is important to notice that we have considered in the previous section the non - stationary regime of spontaneous emission only because the involved fields ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ... ) have a direct analogy with the classical fields of maxwell equations . in other words",
    ", they act like first quantized wave functions for the single - photon state @xcite and lead , therefore , to a simple `` classical - like '' physical interpretation of results obtained , however , in the framework of quantum electrodynamics . nevertheless , the limitation to the transitory regime is not fundamental and if we consider the stationary regime in which the pumping rate of the ( continuous and coherent ) excitation laser source ( like in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is taken into account explicitly , the deductions will actually be very similar . to see that , we first integrate formally the quantum maxwell equations eq .  7 for the point - like dipole source and",
    "we obtain ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath71\\frac{1}{4\\pi r^{3 } } \\nonumber\\\\ + [ 3\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{r}\\cdot\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}}(t - r / c ) \\right)-\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}}(t - r / c ) ] \\frac{1}{c4\\pi r^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is identical to the classical formula . as before we are interested in the detection of emitted photons by a fluorescent nanosphere located close to the dipole @xmath72 and therefore to the calculation of photon observables like the intensity @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "ultimately such calculations reduce to the knowledge of dipole observables like @xmath74 @xmath75=1,2,3)$ ] evaluated at a retarded time @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamics of the nv - center observables is governed by the evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath77 , which is a solution of the well - established optical bloch equations for a two - level system coupled to a coherent monochromatic light excitation .",
    "such a coherent excitation state @xmath78 at frequency @xmath79 is here characterized by the electric field @xmath80 and the ( complex valued ) rabi frequency @xmath81 . after an unitary transformation",
    "the coherent state can be transformed into the vacuum state @xmath39 and the laser field becomes a c - number  @xcite . in other words",
    "it is equivalent to consider the semiclassical optical bloch equations where the excitation is classical and the emission is quantum  @xcite . in the rotating wave and adiabatic  @xcite approximations we get the rate equations  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath34 is as before the spontaneous emission constant and @xmath83 is the pumping rate ( we here neglected phonon like dephasing @xmath84 an approximation valids at low temperature ) . in the stationary regime",
    "the coherence term @xmath85 satisfies the relation @xmath86 with @xmath87 ( an approximation valid under the weak - field condition @xmath88 ) . under the rotating wave approximation  @xcite",
    "this allows us to derive the photo - detection signal @xmath89 that is @xmath90 like for the transitory regime of spontaneous emission ( eq .  13 ) this formula is fundamentally classical in its form .",
    "18 is indeed the intensity of the electric field @xmath8 defined in eq .  2 for a dipole @xmath91 driven at the laser frequency @xmath79 .",
    "consequently the deductions concerning the spatial resolution obtained with a classical and oscillating point - like dipole are kept unchanged within a genuine photon - matter quantum dynamics approach ( this classical analogy will be developed in section iv ) .",
    "we point out that while the imaged fluorescent molecules are electric dipolar in our analysis , this does not constitute a fundamental limitation whatsoever .",
    "actually if the scanned objects are sensitive to the magnetic field produced by the nv - based tip the signal would be proportional to @xmath92|^2 |\\sigma_{eg}|^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath93 in agreement with the classical formulas eqs .  1 , 2 .",
    "more generally nothing prevents us to consider detectors sensitive to @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( @xmath96=1,2,3 $ ] ) .",
    "following glauber theory of photo - detection this would lead to the calculation of signals having the form @xmath97 which again results in a classical - like formula @xmath98 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that there is no fundamental limitation here concerning the measurability of electric and magnetic fields if those fields are defined by eqs .  1 , 2 and 18 , 19 .",
    "as it is well known , actual near - field microscopes are generally far from the point like configuration described in the previous section . indeed ,",
    "a typical nsom uses a metal ( aluminum ) coating along the conical part of the tip for eliminating the background light leaking from the dielectric glass tip onto the sample . without this opaque coating",
    "the resolution of nsom is diffraction limited to dimensions at best  @xcite equal to @xmath99 . at the apex of the tip a small aperture in the metal coating ( with typical diameter @xmath100 nm )",
    "is created which allows confining the optical excitation in a very small volume of typical size @xmath101 .",
    "the resolution of such tips is highly enhanced  @xcite and goes up to dimensions which are essentially diameter limited : @xmath102 .",
    "we will come back to this point paper later in the paper .",
    "+ while the far - field generated by the aperture ( i.e. , for @xmath103 ) is still in a good approximation described by a dipolar behavior , as confirmed experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , the near - field deviates strongly from this simplified assumption .",
    "this has been confirmed in several studies  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , another approach must be developed . + historically the first model used for describing an aperture near - field probe is the one given by rayleigh , bethe , and bouwkamp for the transmission by a subwavelength circular aperture in a infinitely thin and perfectly conducting flat screen  @xcite .",
    "however , because of important differences between the geometry considered for the aperture - nsom tip on the one hand and the ideal flat and thin metal screen of the `` bethe '' model on the other hand  @xcite we developed some time ago a different approach  @xcite , which takes into account the conical geometry of the optical tip and also the various field symmetries . in this model the sources of charge and current around the aperture are considered explicitly in order to calculate the field they generate . additionally , we compared the electric field generated by such a model current and charge distribution with the one predicted using a simpler approach , called `` ring - like model '' hereafter , where the sources of electric current and charge are confined along the annular rim of the aperture  @xcite .",
    "the very good agreement between both models , which was also confirmed independently by antosiewicz and szoplik by comparing the ring - like model predictions with finite difference time domain calculations  @xcite , allows us to use only the ring - like model for the present work .",
    "+ the ring - like model postulates that the electric charge volume density along the ring of radius @xmath104 in the @xmath105 plane is defined as @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath108 is a charge density per length unit of the ring .",
    "the @xmath109 is reminiscent of the @xmath110-electric polarization of the incident field propagating in the nsom fiber tip  @xcite .",
    "the far - field generated by such a ring - like source is to a good approximation electric - dipolar .",
    "starting from the definition of the electric dipole : @xmath111 with @xmath112 the electric current volume density along the rim , using then the charge conservation @xmath113 and considering a current propagating along the @xmath114 direction , we deduce that @xmath115 therefore the electric dipole is @xmath116 which is aligned along the incident polarization direction .",
    "we also point out that in this model the magnetic dipole reads @xmath117 , which is in agreement with the fact that the oscillations of the electric current do not constitute a complete circulation of charges around the ring due to the presence of the sine term in eq .",
    "the electromagnetic field generated by such a distribution of current and charge is obtained by elementary integration of eq .  1 : @xmath118 and it indeed approaches the field generated by the dipole @xmath119 given at large distance by eq .  [ bigdipole ] .",
    "+ a few additional remarks about this model are here useful .",
    "first , the fact that the current has only a @xmath114 component and not a @xmath120 or a @xmath121 component can be justified on symmetry ground by referring to mathematical results by sommerfeld , bouwkamp and others  @xcite showing that in a diffraction problem the dominant contribution of @xmath112 near an edge or a corner must necessarily be the components parallel to the rim .",
    "second , it should also be pointed out that the use of a ring - like model is not new in diffraction theory since it was introduced at the beginning of the xx@xmath122 century by love , kottler , stratton and others @xcite . however , there was to our knowledge no use of such a model for describing the nsom tip emission prior to our own work .",
    "+ additionally , it should be observed that in complete analogy with the old work by stratton and chu ( reviewed by bouwkamp  @xcite ) we can also include in the present description a fictitious density of `` magnetic charge '' @xmath84 and magnetic current @xmath123 along the rim in order to introduce a net magnetic dipole in the formalism .",
    "the formulas for the dipole and fields generated by such magnetic distributions are obtained by analogy with the electric ones ( i.e. , eqs .  1 - 5 and 20 - 24 ) and using the direct substitutions @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 which also imply @xmath128 . the possibility to introduce magnetic distributions and dipoles",
    "is justified in order to explain the empirical observations by obermller _",
    "et al . _",
    "indeed , to be consistent with these results we need to include in our model a magnetic dipole @xmath129 aligned along the @xmath130 direction and such that @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the direction of propagation of light along the fiber tip  @xcite .",
    "this magnetic dipole is automatically accounted for in the model by using the distributions : @xmath133 finally , we point out in agreement with the result by obermller _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that the dipoles used in our model have no components in the direction perpendicular to the aperture plane .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the bethe - bouwkamp model  @xcite which predicts an electric dipole along the axis normal to the aperture plane .",
    "this difference is justified on a symmetry ground due to the conical nature of the nsom metal coating  @xcite which contrasts with the planar geometry used in the work of bethe and bouwkamp .",
    "in order to compare the spatial resolution offered by a nsom aperture tip with the one given by a point - like dipole tip ( i.e. , the nanodiamond based active optical probe @xcite ) we    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     now , due to the optical artifacts , the image with the ring - like nsom becomes much more difficult to interpret resulting in a decrease of the optical resolution .",
    "the effect of optical artifacts even worsens for increasing @xmath134 , which means that the resolving power of the aperture - nsom probe is fundamentally limited by both the radius @xmath104 and the height @xmath134 ( compare fig .",
    "3a and 3b ) .",
    "in contrast we see that the point - like dipole tip leads to well isolated spots during the scan .",
    "interestingly , the direction in which the dipole is polarized does not really change the intensity profile .",
    "this point is of importance for practical applications since the nv - center transition dipole is randomly oriented ( but in a fixed direction ) in the nanodiamond crystal glued at the fiber tip apex  @xcite . + in order to study more precisely the influence of @xmath134 we now calculate the intensity profile corresponding to the scan over the two previous isotropic emitters separated by a gap @xmath135 nm along the @xmath110 direction for various heights @xmath134 varying in the range 10 - 100 nm .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "4 for a dipole orientation along @xmath121 demonstrate clearly that the resolving power of this kind of microscope is ultimately limited by the height @xmath134 only . here , the system offers good resolutions even for @xmath136 nm i.e. for @xmath137 . only if @xmath138 the resolution will be dramatically affected .",
    "these results will actually be very general for gaps @xmath0 much smaller than the wavelength since the near - field of the probe ( which is essentially wavelength independent ) dominates in this spatial range .",
    "in this work , we have compared theoretically the spatial resolution offered by an aperture nsom probe with that obtained using the single - nv - center based probe .",
    "we have proposed simple analytical models for the electromagnetic field generated by both types of probe and have shown that the aperture case can be well reproduced using a ring - like current and charge distributions whereas the nv - center tip can be mimicked by a single point - like electric dipole .",
    "the electromagnetic field generated by the single nv - based tip has also been analyzed using quantum electrodynamics applied to a two - level fluorescent system and the results agree with the classical model .",
    "we have finally studied the optical signal acquisition performed during a scan over simple isotropic fluorescent objects and have demonstrated that the ultimate resolution offered by the standard aperture nsom is limited by both the aperture diameter and the scan height .",
    "this is in contrast with a nv - center point - like source whose resolution is limited solely by the scan height .",
    "therefore , our work stresses the importance of this new optical approach for microscopy and quantum optics in the near - field regime .",

    "<S> since fluorescent nanodiamonds tend to decrease steadily in size , we assimilate a nanodiamond - based tip to a point - like single photon source and compare its ultimate resolution with that offered by standard metal - coated aperture nsom tips . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate both classically and quantum mechanically that nsom based on a point - like tip has a resolving power that is only limited by the scan height over the imaged system whereas the aperture - tip resolution depends critically on both the scan height and aperture diameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the complex distribution of the electromagnetic field around the aperture that tends to artificially duplicate the imaged objects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the point - like tip does not suffer from this `` squint '' and that it rapidly approaches its ultimate resolution in the near - field as soon its scan height falls below the distance between the two nano - objects to be resolved . </S>"
