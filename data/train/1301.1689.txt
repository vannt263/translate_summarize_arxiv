    "we begin with a simple model ( a ) , where we assume a single scaling applies between smbh mass and the total stellar mass of the host galaxy at all redshifts .",

    "we therefore increase the uncertainty in the overall normalization by @xmath57 dex , which provides better agreement between our model uncertainty and the errors in the individual binned measurements of @xmath32 in figure 7 of @xcite .",

    "furthermore , at the bright end of the xlf ( @xmath68 @xmath24 ) , agns with typical mass smbhs are outnumbered by the small fraction of lower stellar mass galaxies with elevated smbh masses , due to the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath62-@xmath31  relation and the steep slope of the smf at high stellar masses ( @xmath69 , see also * ? ? ?",

    "we also note that the shape of @xmath32 at high accretion rates ( @xmath75 ) may be sensitive to the assumed form of the bolometric correction .",

    "our model does not distinguish type 1 agns , making direct comparisons between our model and measurements of the overall smbh mass function or eddington ratio distribution functions ( erdfs ) of type 1 agns difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we can compare the distributions of eddington ratios for samples of type 1 agns selected over limited luminosity ranges , such as those presented by @xcite or @xcite , to predictions for the observed distributions based on our model .",
    "qualitatively , we find reasonable agreement for the distributions : our model predicts that luminous agns ( @xmath97 @xmath24 ) selected in narrow bins of luminosity are predominantly at fairly high eddington ratios ( @xmath98 ) with roughly lognormal distributions of widths @xmath99 dex .",
    "however , our model predicts mean accretion rates that are up to @xmath100 dex higher than the observed distributions and a much larger fraction of agns accreting at super - eddington rates  as high as 50sources could correspond to the luminous type 2 agn population , indicating such sources are the most rapidly accreting sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , potentially bringing them more in line with the predictions of our model . we also note that current uncertainties in the absolute scaling between smbh mass and host mass could lead to systematic differences between our model predictions and these observations .",
    "indeed , recent measurements of smbh scaling relations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the scaling may not be constant with stellar mass and could be as high as @xmath101 for the highest mass objects , although some of these differences could be due to different normalizations in the scaling relations for different types of host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". a larger @xmath62@xmath31  scaling for certain galaxies could move the break in the accretion rate distribution below the eddington limit , which could allow better agreement between our results and these studies of optical type 1 agns .",

    "* ) have presented measurements of the smbh mass functions and erdfs of type 1 agns that model the completeness effects and biases of optical surveys .",
    "while such studies provide vital insight into the type 1 agn population , direct comparisons to our model are not possible as the type 2 agns and low accretion rate sources dominate the space densities in most regimes . nevertheless , such studies do find a smbh mass function with a substantially flatter slope at high masses than the underlying galaxy smf and a erdf that continues to rise at low accretion rates with a slope @xmath102 , in reasonable agreement with our model . a turn over in the erdf and steep decline towards high accretion rates",
    "is also found , although in contrast to our model this comes in at @xmath103 , substantially below the eddington limit assumed in our model .",
    "this is illustrated in panel c of figure [ fig : accdists ] where we over - plot measurements of the distribution of eddington ratios of type 1 agns from the sdss at fixed @xmath62  from @xcite , rescaled to match the normalization of our model c at @xmath104 .",
    "a steep turnover in the distribution is seen at @xmath105 , indicating the dearth of the highest accretion rate sources amongst the type 1 agn population compared to the predictions of our model .",
    "further detailed study of the luminous agn population , including both type 1 and type 2 agns , is needed to fully reconcile the differences in mass functions , erdfs and luminosity functions of the x - ray and optically selected agn populations .",
    "based on our model , we attribute the evolution in the xlf since @xmath5 to a reduction in the overall probability of a galaxy hosting an agn as cosmic time progresses , while the shape of the distribution of accretion rates remains roughly constant .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted as a rapid drop in the rate of agn triggering ( the duty cycle ) or a shift to lower characteristic accretion rates , either of which may be driven by a reduction in the availability of cold gas with cosmic time . despite this rapid evolution , agns have a wide range of specific accretion rates ( with a consistent power - law distribution ) and are hosted by galaxies across a wide range of stellar masses at any epoch .",
    "the details of the physical processes that trigger agns and give rise to this distribution of specific accretion rates are still unclear .",
    "the eddington limit appears to set the maximum rate of smbh growth at all times ( although in rare or short - lived phases this limit may be violated ) .",
    "furthermore , the power - law distribution of accretion rates may reflect variability in the level of agn activity over relatively short timescales ( compared to the lifetime of a galaxy ) , which could also be related to the physical processes in the very central regions of the galaxy that control the rate of smbh accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , variations in larger - scale fueling mechanisms  such as mergers , disk instabilities , cosmological accretion of cold gas , or mass loss from the stellar population of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may also have an impact on the accretion rate distribution .",
    "indeed , changes in large - scale fueling mechanisms may drive the longer - term evolution that leads to lower characteristic accretion rates or reduced duty cycles at later cosmic times .",
    "the origin of this power - law distribution is is thus a key problem for theoretical studies of agn physics .",
    "our model is successful at predicting the predominant evolution of the xlf .",
    "however , we underpredict the number density of moderate luminosity agns ( @xmath106 @xmath24 ) at @xmath60 , although the discrepancy is only at the @xmath107 level .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these luminosity - dependent schemes are associated with  downsizing \" of agn activity .",
    "observationally , downsizing is seen as a rapid evolution in the number density of luminous agns that peaks at @xmath8 , while the space density of lower luminosity agns evolves more weakly and peaks at lower @xmath9 .",
    "downsizing may also be reflected in a flattening of the faint - end slope of the xlf , possibly seen in the observed xlf in our highest redshift bin ( although * ? ? ?",
    "* concluded that a constant shape of the xlf was consistent with the observational data , carefully considering the uncertainties ) .",
    "this downsizing behavior is thought to reflect the build up of smbh masses , whereby the highest mass smbhs form and grow early in the history of the universe , whereas lower mass smbhs carry out most of their growth at later times .",
    "evidence for this behavior may be seen in the growth rates of agns in the local universe ( @xmath109 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the success of our model at reproducing the predominant evolution of the xlf at @xmath0 , it appears that any downsizing behavior may be a secondary effect at these redshifts .",
    "our results indicate that the predominant evolution of the agn population at @xmath91 can be associated with a rapid decline in the probability of hosting an agn for galaxies of any stellar mass as cosmic time progresses .",
    "in fact , @xcite found that the distribution of specific accretion rates was consistent over a wide range of stellar masses  a key assumption of our model  and found no evidence of a downsizing behavior in terms of host stellar mass . nevertheless , the discrepancies between our model and the observed xlf suggest that the specific accretion rate distribution may evolve in a mass - dependent way .",
    "further study is required to confirm such behavior and motivate any refinements to our model .",
    "the evolution of the agn population has strong parallels with the star formation history of the universe , which may also undergo a downsizing behavior where the most massive galaxies appear to form earlier in the history of the universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a critical overview of the observational evidence ) .",
    "however , it is now becoming clear that the rapid decline in the global star formation rate density since @xmath110 is primarily due to a drop in specific star formation rates for all galaxies , with any stellar - mass - dependent downsizing being a secondary effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to our findings for agns ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , how and why these processes are connected remains a key open question .",
    "our simple observationally motivated model assumes that the probability of a galaxy hosting an agn is determined by a universal specific accretion rate distribution that is independent of host stellar mass _ or",
    "_ star formation properties .",
    "thus , the observed agn population ( traced by the xlf ) is determined by the galaxy smf , the scaling between @xmath62  and @xmath31 , and the redshift evolution of the agn duty cycle .",
    "however , studies of the correlation between star formation and agn accretion rates paint a more complex picture , indicating that star formation and agn accretion rates are connected , at least for the most luminous sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when considering the nuclear regions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or when averaged over a large population of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the distributions of accretion rates for optically selected narrow - line agns in the local universe using the sdss and found that agns have two distinct modes of accretion characterized by very different accretion rate distributions in young , star - forming galaxies and older , passively evolving galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite also showed that x - ray selected agns are more likely to be found in star - forming galaxies on the star - formation main sequence .",
    "given these important findings , our model could be improved by considering the smfs of star - forming and quiescent galaxies separately , with appropriate accretion rate distributions for each population .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the smfs of the star - forming and quiescent galaxy populations follow substantially different evolutionary paths .",
    "however , to proceed further with such studies requires accurate measurements of @xmath32 , including any stellar mass and redshift dependence , for each of the galaxy populations ( star - forming and quiescent ) . in @xcite",
    "we split the galaxy population according to optical color and found evidence for a weak ( factor @xmath111 ) enhancement in the probability of hosting an agn for blue galaxies ( indicating current star formation ) compared to red ( quiescent ) galaxies , although both populations exhibited a wide , power - law distribution of accretion rates .",
    "such relatively minor differences would have relatively little impact on the results of this paper but appear inconsistent with the findings of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "optical color may be a poor discriminator for the levels of star formation .",
    "further study is required to accurately determine how the accretion rate distributions for x - ray agns depend on the star formation properties of their host galaxies , refine our observationally motivated scheme to link the galaxy and agn populations , and fully unveil the interplay between agn and star formation .",
    "a number of prior studies have presented models to link the evolution of agns and galaxies , either from an observationally motivated standpoint ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the current uncertainties regarding smbh fueling mechanisms and the physics of agn accretion , the luminosity function is often used to constrain the key parameters in the prescriptions for smbh growth , such as the agn duty cycle or the relative rates of different agn triggering mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , up - to - date semi - analytic models , including sophisticated prescriptions for smbhs , are able to predict the agn luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it can be difficult to assess the level of tuning required for a successful model or robustly test the underlying physical assumptions .",
    "for example , the @xcite and @xcite models both reproduce the observed agn luminosity functions but infer very different levels of agn triggering due to disk instabilities versus merger - driven inflows .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite model reproduces the observed downsizing trends in the xlf by modifying their fiducial model to include a limit to accretion rates that depends on the cold gas fraction , as well as a prescription for agn triggering due to disk instabilities and a ",
    "heavy seeding \" prescription for the first smbhs .",
    "@xcite , however , attribute the observed downsizing to obscuration effects , incorporated into their model using a prescription based on observations by @xcite .",
    "our simple , observationally motivated model takes a very different approach .",
    "we adopt the observed smf of galaxies and populate the galaxies with agns using models for @xmath32 , based on actual measurements , requiring only a few straightforward assumptions to extend to higher accretion rates .",
    "our final model has one free parameter which is tuned to match the observed bright end of the xlf but does not alter our model predictions at lower luminosities .",
    "unlike the models described above , our observationally motivated scheme does not provide a complete picture of the relationship between agns and their host galaxies or the underlying physical processes that control their co - evolution .",
    "however , our results indicate that the universal distribution of specific accretion rates , independent of host stellar mass , is the key underlying property of the agn population that is needed to reproduce the xlf .",
    "thus , the distribution of specific accretion rates is a vital observational constraint for theoretical models of agns and their evolution within a cosmological context .",
    "our model also provides a framework to interpret different measurements , understand underlying observational biases that may skew the properties of samples of agns , and motivate future observations .",
    "in fact , the lack of downsizing in our model predictions and the discrepancy with the observed xlf for @xmath112 @xmath24  at @xmath113 provides an important motivation for precise measurements of @xmath32 at these redshifts and higher .",
    "ultimately , conclusive tests of cosmological agn - galaxy models may require comparisons of predictions in the multivariate space of galaxy stellar mass , star formation properties , and the distribution of agn accretion rates .",
    "we have developed a simple , observationally motivated model to link the evolution of agns and their host galaxies that predicts the x - ray luminosity function of agns at @xmath0 .",
    "we use new measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function from primus @xcite combined with a simple model to populate these galaxies with agns .",
    "our model is based on our measurements showing that the probability of a galaxy hosting an agn is defined by a power - law function of specific accretion rate ( with slope @xmath114 ) that depends only on redshift and is independent of host stellar mass @xcite .",
    "we extend our model to higher x - ray luminosities and accretion rates by allowing for a break in the specific accretion rate function at a point corresponding to the eddington limit .",

    "our model provides a simple picture of the connection between agns and their host galaxies .",
    "based on the results of @xcite , agn activity may be triggered in galaxies of any stellar mass , with the growth rate of the smbh being defined by a single distribution of specific accretion rates .",
    "the observed rapid evolution of the agn population since @xmath116 is attributed to an overall reduction in the probability of any galaxy hosting an agn , indicating a severe reduction in the rate of agn fueling as cosmic time progresses .",
    "while the physical processes driving this behavior remain unclear , they appear to operate in a uniform manner over a wide range of stellar masses . given our success at reproducing the xlf at @xmath48 with this simple model , it appears that the universal distribution of specific accretion rates is the key observational constraint for theoretical models of agn evolution .",
    "we find that the observed xlf is dominated in number density by moderately massive galaxies ( @xmath117 ) , which is due to the combination of the shape of the galaxy smf and the shape of the specific accretion rate distribution .",
    "this predominance of moderately massive host galaxies in x - ray selected agn samples does not represent a preference for agn activity at any particular stellar mass range .",
    "the observed population of the most luminous agn may be severely skewed to the most extreme sources with elevated smbh masses relative to their host galaxies and in short - lived phases of very rapid smbh accretion .",
    "these sources are likely to provide a biased view of the connection between agns and the properties of their host galaxies .",

    "thus , the specific accretion rate distribution may evolve in a mass - dependent manner , although any downsizing behavior appears to be a secondary effect at @xmath91 .",
    "our model also lacks known connections between the star formation in galaxies and the growth of their smbhs .",
