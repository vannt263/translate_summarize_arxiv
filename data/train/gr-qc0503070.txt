    "in the classic presentation of the twin paradox , @xcite , two observers each witness the other receding at constant velocity and returning at the same velocity at a later time . each observer will claim he was stationary and , by time dilation , that the _ other _ should be younger upon meeting .",
    "the resolution is that one observer turned around at some point during the journey and , consequently , was not inertial for the entire duration of the trip .",
    "this kinematic asymmetry allows both twins to unambiguously determine which of them aged more during the journey : the twin who remained inertial throughout .    in a space - time with one spatial dimension compactified , @xmath1 , this kinematic solution no longer works .",
    "both twins can remain inertial for the _ entire _ journey if they confine their motion to the compact dimension ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : cylinderplane ] ) . in this case",
    ", the resolution lies in recognizing that compactifying a spatial dimension breaks global lorentz invariance , @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is now a _ preferred _ inertial reference frame , @xcite , namely that for which the circle is purely spatial ( _ i.e. , _ the observer whose worldline does not wind around the circle , @xcite ) .",
    "the relationship of each observer to this reference frame establishes the asymmetry required to resolve the paradox : the observer in the preferred frame is essentially at rest with respect to the universe and ages more than the moving observer during the journey .",
    "it is well known that observers can determine whether or not they are in the preferred rest frame by sending light beams in opposite directions along the compact dimension , @xcite . after waiting for the light beams to traverse the entire compact dimension , only the observer in the preferred frame will receive both signals simultaneously .",
    "moreover , the time interval between the two signals is related to the velocity of the observer relative to the preferred frame .",
    "such a global experiment is of little practical use if the size of the circle is on the order of cosmological scales since an observer would have to wait about a hubble time before receiving his signals . here",
    "we present a _",
    "local _ experiment that either twin can perform to determine his relationship to the preferred frame based on measuring deviations from the @xmath0 force law .",
    "the electric ( or gravitational ) field in a universe with a compact dimension is not exactly @xmath0 but depends on the size @xmath2 of the compact dimension because field lines are confined in this direction .",
    "since local lorentz invariance still holds , the functional form of the field is the same for all inertial observers , but the parameters which appear in the force law , which can be thought of as effective fine - structure ( or newton s ) constants , do depend on the observer .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively because the size of the compact dimension is not invariant under boosts .",
    "a boosted observer sees a larger effective circle ( segment , actually ) and thus a weaker field .",
    "conversely , an observer in the preferred frame measures the strongest field at fixed distance from the source . hence by making measurements of the electric field of a point charge stationary in their frame , observers may determine the effective length of the compact dimension in their frame , @xmath3 .",
    "comparing @xmath3 with @xmath2 , the length of the compact dimension in the preferred frame , precisely specifies the relationship of the observer to the preferred frame and resolves the paradox : the boosted observer ages less during the paradox by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "the manifold we are considering in this problem is the cylinder , @xmath5 , with the minkowski metric , @xmath6 .",
    "it can be constructed from @xmath7 by imposing the equivalence relation @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the circumference of the compact dimension and @xmath9 is an integer .",
    "each equivalence class of points @xmath10 $ ] in @xmath11 is represented by a single point @xmath12 on the cylinder , chosen such that @xmath13 .",
    "we thus have two equivalent pictures of the manifold @xmath14 : the `` wrapped '' picture , fig .",
    "[ figure : cylinder ] , where each point is a unique event , and the `` unwrapped '' picture in the covering space , fig .",
    "[ figure : plane ] , where an infinity of points represents the same event .",
    "we can consider the latter picture as an infinite sheet of paper which we `` wrap '' into a cylinder to construct the former picture .",
    "it will prove useful to be able to switch back and forth between these two pictures .",
    "lorentz invariance is broken globally since one dimension is compact , which leads to the existence of a preferred rest frame . to see this ,",
    "consider that the equivalence relation is manifestly dependent on coordinates and so is _ itself _ defined in a particular frame , call it @xmath15 . in this frame ,",
    "a point @xmath16 in the wrapped picture corresponds to an infinity of points @xmath17 in the unwrapped picture .",
    "these points are all simultaneous in @xmath15 and they differ from each other only by spatial translations .",
    "what about @xmath18 , a frame moving with respect to @xmath15 at some velocity @xmath19 ? in this frame , the point @xmath20 has coordinates @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . in the unwrapped picture",
    ", this point corresponds to the points @xmath23 .",
    "we see that the equivalence relation in an arbitrary inertial frame @xmath18 becomes @xmath24 thus , the image points simultaneous in frame @xmath18 are not only translated through space , but through time as well .",
    "this is a recognition of the fact that lines of equal time for observers with @xmath25 do not close on themselves but spiral around the cylinder .",
    "there is only one observer , characterized by @xmath26 , whose line of equal time closes on itself , and for whom the identification is a purely spatial one .",
    "we refer to the frame of this observer as the _ preferred rest frame_.    it should be noted that the effective size of the compact dimension in a frame @xmath18 is @xmath27 , as can be seen directly from .",
    "we thus define the effective length of the compact dimension : @xmath28 the preferred observer measures the smallest value of @xmath3 , namely @xmath2 .",
    "the essential problem with the twin paradox in this space - time is that both twins can draw minkowski diagrams which depict the other twin winding around the circle and coming back .",
    "hence each twin will predict that the other is younger .",
    "we can resolve this contradiction by noting that , for the preferred observer , the images of the fundamental domain @xmath29 are simply translated spatially by . for a non - preferred observer ,",
    "however , these images are also translated in time .",
    "this implies that a diagram like fig.[figure : plane ] is not valid in a non - preferred frame , and that a non - preferred observer can not naively draw minkowski diagrams .",
    "instead , the non - preferred observer must take into account certain transition functions .    because one dimension is compact ,",
    "observers in our space - time have a problem with multi - valued coordinates . in sec .  [ descriptionofspacetime ]",
    "we glossed over this point and implicitly treated all lengths in the @xmath30-dimension modulo @xmath2 . to be more precise",
    ", we should really cover the manifold @xmath31 with two single - valued coordinate patches and glue them together with appropriate transition functions .    in some coordinate system @xmath15 ,",
    "let patch @xmath32 cover the entirety of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 dimensions and cover an open interval @xmath36 of the compact @xmath30-dimension .",
    "likewise , let patch @xmath37 cover the entirety of the uncompact dimensions and cover an interval @xmath38 in the @xmath30-dimension .",
    "as an analogy , one may think of patch @xmath32 as a piece of paper wrapped around the cylinder and patch @xmath37 as a strip of tape applied on the seam of patch @xmath32 .     and @xmath37 , to cover the manifold @xmath31,width=96,height=288 ]    as we pass from patch @xmath32 to patch @xmath37",
    ", we wind around the cylinder or , equivalently , move to another image patch in the unwrapped picture , fig .",
    "[ figure : plane ] .",
    "the index @xmath9 can thus be thought of as winding number , @xcite .",
    "if observers keep track of the winding number of light signals , etc . ,",
    ". describes how to relabel paths as their winding number changes . since a change in winding number corresponds to leaving patch @xmath32 , crossing through patch @xmath37 , and returning to patch @xmath32 , eq .",
    "is recognized to be exactly the transition function we need : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the transition functions used when winding around in the positive and negative @xmath30-directions , respectively .",
    "when a given observer attempts to describe the physics within a single patch , say patch @xmath32 , he must keep track of how to adjust the coordinates he assigns to objects as they exit and then re - enter the patch . for observer @xmath15 , in the preferred frame , @xmath42 , and there is no translation in time as objects wind around the universe .",
    "this is why he can naively draw diagrams like fig .",
    "[ figure : plane ] . for observer @xmath18 ,",
    "however , @xmath25 , and the transition functions involve translations in time . in this frame , a diagram like fig .",
    "[ figure : plane ] would simply be incorrect .",
    "figure  [ figure : minkowskis ] properly depicts the situation in both frames using the appropriate transition functions .",
    "no contradiction ensues .    if both twins know their velocity with respect to the preferred frame , then , by eq .",
    ", they can find their transition functions and use them to draw correct diagrams . by using the transition functions ,",
    "both observers in the twin paradox come to the conclusion that the twin in the non - preferred frame ages less during the journey by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "we have thus far used two coordinate patches for the purely mathematical reason of avoiding multi - valued coordinates .",
    "the need for multiple patches can , of course , be understood from a physical point of view by considering the synchronization of clocks in this space - time .",
    "the usual method for synchronizing clocks is einstein synchronization : if an observer is midway between two clocks and receives light signals from each clock with the same reading simultaneously then the two clocks are said to be einstein synchronized .",
    "usually , einstein synchronization is a transitive process : if clock @xmath32 is synchronized with clock @xmath37 , and clock @xmath37 is synchronized with clock @xmath44 , then clock @xmath32 is synchronized with clock @xmath44 .",
    "einstein synchronization immediately fails on a compact dimension because there are two midpoints between any pair of clocks .",
    "we can circumvent this problem by choosing a `` left - most '' and a `` right - most '' clock .",
    "these clocks will demarcate the edges of what will become a coordinate patch .",
    "we can synchronize clocks by using the midpoint in between these two boundary clocks , the midpoint in the coordinate patch we are constructing .",
    "transitivity is preserved because we confine all our procedures to this single patch which , without global data , is indistinguishable from an uncompact space .",
    "a problem occurs when we let the left - most and right - most clocks approach each other , letting our coordinate patch encircle the entire compact dimension .",
    "as soon as they overlap , that is , as soon as the left - most clock and the right - most clock are the _ same _ clock , we will have constructed a global rest frame and , in a non - preferred frame , this clock will have to read one time to be synchronized with the clock on its left and another time to be synchronized with the clock on its right .",
    "this is easily seen by considering lines of equal time in the wrapped picture . for the preferred observer , such lines close on themselves and form circles . for a non - preferred observer , however , they do not close but instead spiral endlessly around the cylinder .",
    "the non - preferred observer s coordinate system corresponds to a segment of such a spiral .",
    "if this is to span the cylinder , then the segment of the spiral must also span the cylinder .",
    "however , if we require each clock to only read one time , this implies that it must be discontinuous at a point .",
    "the transition functions are a reflection of this fact .",
    "therefore , while it is possible for the boosted observer to synchronize clocks in this way , evidently this comes at the expense of homogeneity .",
    "indeed , it introduces a special line on the cylinder where time jumps .",
    "in fact , there is a perspicuous analogy between the use of transition functions and patches on this space - time and a more familiar phenomenon : the time zones on the earth .",
    "imagine a person standing on the equator keeping time by the sun . in his reference frame , fixed at a point on the earth s surface",
    ", the sun revolves about the earth once per day .",
    "he attempts to label points on the equator with their distance from him and with a particular time based on the position of the sun as seen from that point . at a particular moment , let him declare that it is high noon at his own position .",
    "points on the equator east of him will be assigned later times , while points west will be assigned earlier times .",
    "as long as his reference frame is local and does nt span the equator , nothing goes wrong in his scheme .",
    "as soon as it does , however , the point diametrically opposite him on the equator demands to be labeled by _ two _ points in time , one to coincide with the points immediately east of it and another for the points immediately west .",
    "his solution is to draw an international date line through that point  a transition function or discontinuity in his coordinate system .      to determine his velocity with respect to the preferred frame",
    ", an observer can send out light signals in opposite directions along the compact @xmath30-dimension , @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ figure : minkowskis ] it is clear that the preferred observer , whose transition function does not involve translations in time , will receive the signals at the same time ( at the event labeled by @xmath45 ) .",
    "a non - preferred observer , however , will measure a time - delay in the reception of the two signals ( the events @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the proper time at which event @xmath45 occurs .",
    "this expression can be used to determine the velocity with respect to the preferred frame . for the preferred observer",
    ", one has @xmath42 and indeed @xmath50 .",
    "once an observer knows his velocity with respect to the preferred frame , he can easily calculate the transition functions and draw appropriate minkowski diagrams .",
    "the experiment described above would take a prohibitively long time in a universe of any realistic size , as light signals have to encircle the _",
    "entire _ compact dimension ! furthermore , this global solution does not seem as satisfying as the local solution to the twin paradox in standard space - time @xmath11 . in the standard space - time , each observer may easily conduct local experiments to determine whether or not he is the accelerated twin  he could hang a pendulum , for example , and watch for any deviations in its path during the journey .",
    "it seems that any local kinematic experiment would not serve to resolve the paradox because there are no _ local _ kinematic differences between the two observers which might be exploited to distinguish them .",
    "the global solution already presented works precisely because it is global - the light beams traverse the entire compact dimension , cross between coordinate patches , and thus force the observers to use transition functions , which encode the relationship between the observer and the preferred rest frame . here",
    "we propose to exploit the local consequences of global phenomena such as electric or gravitational fields .",
    "a field permeates all of space and thus `` knows '' about the global topology .",
    "this global knowledge can be extracted by making measurements of the field at a few points .",
    "consider the electromagnetic field of a point charge @xmath51 at rest at the origin of the preferred rest frame .",
    "one expects that the formula for the electromagnetic field of this point charge should deviate from the usual @xmath0 since the field lines can not spread as much in the compact direction .",
    "moreover , such deviations should depend on the size of the circle , @xmath2 .",
    "[ figure : chargeboost ]    to calculate the field , it is easiest to work in the unwrapped picture and consider each image charge as a source for the electromagnetic field at the field point ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . there is no magnetic field , of course , since the point charge and hence all its image charges are at rest in this frame .",
    "we find @xmath52^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\,,\\ ] ] which depends on @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "it is easy to see that one recovers the usual coulomb law in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "what about the electric field of a point charge stationary in a _ non - preferred _ frame ? because lorentz invariance is locally valid in this space - time , the field measured by a non - preferred observer should have the same functional form as eq .",
    " it can only differ in the values of some parameters .",
    "the only parameter to be found in eq .   is the length of the compact dimension , @xmath2 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath2 to be replaced with @xmath3 , the effective length of the compact dimension as measured by an observer in a non - preferred frame .",
    "this answer is most easily obtained by noting that a point charge stationary in a non - preferred frame is of course moving at some constant velocity with respect to the preferred observer . from the preferred frame",
    ", we can boost directly into the rest frame of the charge and find that we have reproduced the situation we started with prior to deriving eq . : a stationary point charge and an infinite series of image charges , each separated by the effective length of the compact dimension in that frame , @xmath3 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    ", we have @xmath54^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\ ] ] for an arbitrary frame @xmath18 . the only change from eq .",
    "is a substitution @xmath55 .",
    "the field measured by any observer in this universe thus has a dependence on the parameter @xmath3 , the effective length of the universe in the frame of the observer .",
    "a local experiment immediately suggests itself .",
    "if we presume observers in this space - time know the value of @xmath2 , then measuring the electric field of a stationary point charge at a few points is enough to determine @xmath3 , from which one can determine @xmath56 and resolve the twin paradox .    restricting our attention to points on the @xmath30-axis , the infinite sum in eq .   can be written in closed form using residue theorems and then expanded in powers of @xmath57 : @xmath58 \\hat{x}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is intriguing to note that the first order correction to the electric field ( along the @xmath30-axis ) in this topology is constant , with the fractional difference from the usual coulomb field given by @xmath59 as expected , the difference increases with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "if this experiment is to be practical , however , then the ratio @xmath60 must not be vanishingly small .",
    "the smallest allowed @xmath2 is @xmath61  gpc from cosmic microwave background analysis , @xcite ( though this figure may require revision , see , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , for any realistic @xmath30 , this ratio is unmeasurably small .",
    "moreover , it is easily seen that the difference in magnitude between the fields measured in the preferred frame and a non - preferred frame is further suppressed by a factor of @xmath62 in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "there are two points to be made about the above derivation .",
    "first of all , eq .   assumes that the charge has been at rest for sufficiently long so that our expression for the electrostatic field applies .",
    "the analysis of a moving charge would require taking into account the self - interactions with radiated photons that circle around the compact dimension and hit the charge back .",
    "secondly , we have completely neglected cosmic expansion and approximated our universe as static . modeling the paradox on an expanding cylinder ( or any compact friedmann - robertson - walker universe ) introduces many subtleties , @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank justin khoury for his supervision during this work .",
    "we would also like to thank allan blaer , brian greene , dan kabat , janna levin , maulik parikh , and amanda weltman for helpful discussions .",
