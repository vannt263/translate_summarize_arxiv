    "we take advantage of new opportunities in theory ( development of rather reliable microscopic transport codes for @xmath0 ) and in experiments ( availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams , improved possibility of measuring event - by - event correlations ) to present results that are severely constraining the existing effective interaction models",

    "the possibility of an entrance channel bremsstrahlung dipole radiation due to an initial different n / z distribution was suggested at the beginning of the nineties @xcite .",
    "after several experimental evidences , in fusion as well as in deep - inelastic reactions @xcite we have now a good understanding of the process and stimulating new perspectives from the use of radioactive beams .    during the charge equilibration process taking place in the first stages of dissipative reactions between colliding ions with different n / z ratios , a large amplitude dipole collective motion develops in the composite dinuclear system , the so - called dynamical dipole mode .",
    "this collective dipole gives rise to a prompt @xmath12-ray emission which depends : i ) on the absolute value of the intial dipole moment @xmath13 being @xmath14 and @xmath15 the center of mass of protons and of neutrons respectively , while r@xmath16 and r@xmath17 are the projectile and target radii ; ii ) on the fusion / deep - inelastic dynamics ; iii ) on the symmetry term , below saturation , that is acting as a restoring force .    a detailed description is obtained in a microscopic approach based on semiclassical transport equations , of landau - vlasov type , @xcite , where mean field and two - body collisions are treated in a self - consistent way , see details in @xcite .",
    "realistic effective interactions of skyrme type are used .",

    "we must add a couple of comments of interest for the experimental selection of the dynamical dipole : i ) the centroid is always shifted to lower energies ( large deformation of the dinucleus ) ; ii ) a clear angular anisotropy should be present since the prompt mode has a definite axis of oscillation ( on the reaction plane ) at variance with the statistical @xmath30 . in a very recent experiment",

    "we can predict interesting isospin transport effects for this new fragmentation mechanism since clusters are formed still in a dilute asymmetric matter but always in contact with the regions of the projectile - like and target - like remnants almost at normal densities . since the difference between local neutron - proton chemical potentials is given by @xmath54",

    "we can figure out a continuous transition from fast produced fragments via neck instabilities to clusters formed in a dynamical fission of the projectile(target ) residues up to the evaporated ones ( statistical fission ) . along this line",
    "it would be even possible to disentangle the effects of volume and shape instabilities .",
    "a neutron enrichment of the overlap ( `` neck '' ) region is expected , due to the neutron migration from higher ( spectator ) to lower ( neck ) density regions , directly related to the slope of the symmetry energy @xcite .",

    "in central collisions at 30 - 50 mev / a , where the full disassembly of the system into many fragments is observed , one can study specifically properties of liquid - gas phase transitions occurring in asymmetric matter @xcite .",
    "for instance , in neutron - rich matter , phase co - existence leads to a different asymmetry in the liquid and gaseous phase : fragments ( liquid ) appear more symmetric with respect to the initial matter , while light particles ( gas ) are more neutron - rich .",
    "the amplitude of this effect depends on specific properties of the isovector part of the nuclear interaction , namely on the value and the derivative of the symmetry energy at low density .",
    "this investigation is interesting in a more general context : in heavy ion collisions the dilute phase appears during the expansion of the interacting matter .",
    "thus we study effects of the coupling of expansion , fragmentation and distillation in a two - component ( neutron - proton ) system .",
    "we present fully consistent dynamical results , based on stochastic microscopic transport approaches widely tested in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the correct treatment of fluctuations is essential to reproduce the dynamics of spinodal instabilities in the dilute expansion phase .",
    "we focus on central collisions , @xmath62 , considering symmetric reactions between systems having three different initial asymmetry : @xmath63 with @xmath64 = 1.24,1.48,1.64 , respectively .",
    "the considered beam energy is 50 mev / a .",
    "1200 events have been run for each reaction and for each of the two symmetry energies adopted ( asy - soft and asystiff , see before ) @xcite .    in central collisions ,",
    "after the initial collisional shock , the system expands and breaks up into many pieces , due to the development of volume ( spinodal ) and surface instabilities .",
    "the formation of a bubble - like configuration is observed , where the initial fragments are located .",
    "first , let us briefly recall some general features concerning the isotopic content of fragments and emitted nucleons , as obtained with the two considered iso - eos s .",
    "in the following we will restrict our analysis to fragments with charge in the range between 3 and 10 ( that we call intermediate mass fragments ( imf s ) ) .",
    "the average n / z of emitted nucleons ( gas phase ) and imf s is presented in fig.[isodist ] as a function of the initial @xmath64 of the three colliding systems .",
    "one observes that , generally , the gas phase ( right panel ) is more neutron - rich in the asysoft case , while imf s ( left panel ) are more symmetric .",
    "this is due to the larger value of the symmetry energy at low density for the asysoft parameterization @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the asystiff case , due to the rather low value of the symmetry energy , coulomb effects dominate and the n / z of the gas phase becomes lower than that for imf s , because protons are preferentially emitted .",
    "now we move to investigate in more detail correlations between fragment isotopic content and kinematical properties .",
    "the idea in this investigation is that fragmentation originates from the break - up of a composite source that expands with a given velocity field .",
    "since neutrons and protons experience different forces , one may expect a different radial flow for the two species . in this case , the n / z composition of the source would not be uniform , but would depend on the radial distance from the center or mass or , equivalently , on the local velocity .",
    "this trend should then be reflected in a clear correlation between isospin content and kinetic energy of the formed @xmath53 s , @xcite .",
    "now we investigate peripheral collisions between similar systems with different isospin , specifically collisions of different combinations of @xmath65 isotopes .",
    "the isospin is used here both as a tracer of the reaction mechanism , as well as an observable of interest with respect to the iso - eos . in the prevoius sections",
    "we have seen the isospin dynamics in instability regions and fragment formation . here",
    "we study more directly the isospin transport in binary events .",
    "a neck of density below normal density develops between the two heavy residues , the evolution of which is driven by the motion of the spectators . during this phase isospin",
    "is transferred to the neck due to the density difference between the neck and the residues ; this effect is called isospin migration , which leads to a more neutron - rich neck .",
    "in addition in collision systems with different asymmetry isospin is transported through neck due to the asymmetry gradient leading to an equilibration of the isospin of the residues , which has been called isospin diffusion .",
    "thus in asymmetric systems there is a competion of isospin migration and diffusion .",
    "the isospin transport can be discussed in a compact way by means of the chemical potentials for protons and neutrons as a function of density @xmath66 and isospin @xmath67 @xcite . from this",
    "the @xmath68 currents can be expressed as @xmath69 with @xmath70 the drift , and @xmath71 the diffusion coefficients for transport , which are given explicitely in ref .",
    "@xcite . of interest here",
    "are the differences of currents between protons and neutrons which have a simple relation to the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath72 thus the isospin transport due to density gradients , i.e. isospin migration , depends on the slope of the symmetry energy , or the symmetry pressure , while the transport due to isospin concentration gradients , i.e. isospin diffusion , depends on the absolute value of the symmetry energy . in peripheral collisions discussed here ,",
    "residues of about normal density are in contact with the neck region of density below saturation density . in this region of density",
    "a stiff iso - eos has a smaller value but a larger slope compared to a soft iso - eos .",
    "correspondingly we expect opposite effects of these models on the migration and diffusion of isospin .",
    "we will in particular discuss the so - called imbalance ratio ( also called rami- or transport - ratio ) , which is defined as @xcite @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is an isospin sensitive quantity that is to be investigated with respect to equilibration , as e.g. the asymmetry @xmath75 which is considered here primarily , but also other quantities , such as isoscaling coefficients , ratios of production of light fragments , etc .",
    "the indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 refer to the symmetric reaction between the heavy ( n - rich ) and the light ( n - poor ) systems , while @xmath78 refers to the mixed reaction .",
    "@xmath79 denote the rapidity region , in which this quantity is measured , in particular the projectile and target rapidity regions .",
    "clearly , this ratio is @xmath80 in the projectile and target region , respectively , for complete transparency , and oppositely for complete rebound , while it is zero for complete equilibration .      the centrality dependence of the imbalance ratio , for ( sn , sn ) collisions , has been investigated in experiments @xcite as well as in theory @xcite with rather promising results for the sensitivity to the symmetry term stiffness .",
    "we propose here a new analysis which appears experimentally more selective .",
    "the interaction time certainly influences the amount of isospin equilibration , see refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "longer interaction times should be correlated to a larger dissipation .",
    "the dissipation , in turn , has been measured , i.e. in deep inelastic collisions , by the kinetic energy loss .",
    "[ imb_eloss ]    in fig.3 we present the imbalance ratio as a function of the relative energy loss ( h:124sn , l:112sn , two beam energies 35 and 50amev ) . in the upper panel",
    "we separate the results for momentum dependent and independent ( md vs mi ) interactions and stiff and soft iso - eos , in each case the results for 35 and 50 mev are collected together and connected by lines .",
    "we now see that the points for the different incident energies approximately fall on one line , however with some scatter around it .",
    "the curves for the soft eos ( dashed ) are generally lower in the projectile region ( and oppositely for the target region ) , i.e. show more equilibration , that those for the stiff eos . in order to emphasize this trend we have , in the lower panel of the figure ,",
    "collected together the values for the stiff ( circles , solid ) and the soft ( squares , dashed ) iso - eos , and fitted them by a quadratic curve .",
    "it is seen that this fit gives a good representation of the trend of the results .",
    "the difference between the curves for the stiff and soft iso - eos in the lower panel then isolates the effect of the iso - eos from kinematical effects depending on the interaction time .",
    "it is seen , that there is a systematic effect of the symmetry energy of the order of about 20 percent , which should be measurable .",
    "the correlation suggested in fig.3 should represent a general feature of isospin diffusion , and it would be of great interest to verify it experimentally .",
    "finally we focus our attention on relativistic heavy ion collisions , that provide a unique terrestrial opportunity to probe the in - medium nuclear interaction at high densities .",
    "an effective lagrangian approach to the hadron interacting system is extended to the isospin degree of freedom : within the same frame equilibrium properties ( @xmath1 , @xcite ) and transport dynamics @xcite can be consistently derived . within a covariant picture of the nuclear mean field , for the description of the symmetry energy at saturation ( a ) only the lorentz vector @xmath66 mesonic field , and ( b ) both , the vector @xmath66 ( repulsive ) and scalar @xmath81 ( attractive ) effective fields @xcite can be included . in the latter case",

    "<S> heavy ion collisions ( @xmath0 ) represent a unique tool to probe the in - medium nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation . in this work we present a selection of reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly sensitive to the isovector part of the interaction , i.e. to the symmetry term of the nuclear equation of state ( @xmath1 ) . at low energies the behavior of the symmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and fragment production mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss the recently observed dynamical dipole radiation , due to a collective neutron - proton oscillation during the charge equilibration in fusion and deep - inelastic collisions . </S>",

    "<S> new isospin sensitive observables are also presented for deep - inelastic , fragmentation collisions and isospin equilibration measurements ( imbalance ratios ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the high density symmetry term can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies ( few @xmath4 range ) , that can even allow a `` direct '' study of the covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the hadron medium . </S>",
    "<S> rather sensitive observables are proposed from collective flows and from pion / kaon production . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of the transition to a mixed hadron - quark phase , at high baryon and isospin density , is finally suggested . </S>",
    "<S> some signatures could come from an expected `` neutron trapping '' effect . </S>",
