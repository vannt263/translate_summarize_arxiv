    "this paper is a sequel to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "its aim is to demonstrate usefulness of the _ mathematica_based package * superlie * ( @xcite ) already tested on various problems ( @xcite ) . our results  computation of @xmath12 ( complete , or partial )  are orthogonal \" to those of @xcite who computed only @xmath13 and @xmath14 but for all ( finite dimensional ) irreducible modules @xmath1 .",
    "we also complete tyutin s description @xcite of deformations of @xmath15 who ignored odd parameters ; cf .",
    "@xcite .    during the talk at the conference we indicated how lie algebra cohomology",
    "is related to a new \" ( designed in late 1960 s ) and seemingly never explored method for solving differential equations and for the study of stability of various dynamical systems . for an exposition of this and many other applications of cohomology ,",
    "see @xcite . for basics on lie superalgebras",
    "we consider , see @xcite . for main data on lie algebra cohomology and rudiments of lie superalgebra cohomology , see fuchs s book @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that if the lie algebra @xmath10 is finite dimensional and simple and @xmath1 a finite dimensional @xmath10-module ( both over @xmath16 ) , then @xmath17 however , there are very few general theorems helping to compute @xmath18 when both @xmath10 and @xmath1 are considered over @xmath19 or @xmath20 , even less for lie superalgebras .    on the other hand , c. gruson suggested a totally new method ( applicable to lie superalgebras only , not to lie algebras ) @xcite . at the moment",
    ", gruson s method is only applied to the trivial coefficients .",
    "its applicability in other cases is not studied yet .",
    "so , for nontrivial modules over lie superalgebras , we have only the same tool researchers had at their disposal at the birth of the cohomology theory : the definition .",
    "to see what phenomena and patterns we might encounter , we use * superlie * ( @xcite ) to get a supply of reliable results to be used in more general analytic study .",
    "the standard proof of @xmath21 uses the ( even , quadratic ) casimir operator . passing to lie superalgebras @xmath10",
    "we observe that : ( a ) some lie superalgebras have no ( even ) quadratic casimir operator , ( b ) for some lie superalgebras , such an operator exists but vanishes at various @xmath1 s .",
    "the algebras we consider here have these properties ( a ) and ( b ) , and hence ( 1 ) fails sometimes .    in what follows , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a lie superalgebra @xmath10 ; set @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let the @xmath26 be elements of the ( weight ) basis of @xmath10 ( for example , the chevalley basis if @xmath10 is simple ) , and let the @xmath27 be the elements of the dual basis .",
    "the basis of cochains is given by monomials of the form @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we set @xmath31 the _ nijenhuis bracket _ on @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the shift of parity functor , is given by the formula ( hereafter @xmath33 is the parity of @xmath34 in @xmath32 , not in @xmath35 ) @xmath36=a\\cdot b-(-1)^{p(a)p(b)}b\\cdot a\\in c^{n_{a}+n_b-2}\\,.\\ ] ] let us not only change parity , but also shift the degree by setting @xmath37 ; we denote this by writing @xmath38 .",
    "it is subject to a direct verification that ( 2 ) defines the lie superalgebra structure on @xmath8 , and @xmath39=[\\d a , b]+(-1)^{p(a)}[a,\\d b]\\,.\\ ] ] therefore @xmath40 is a subalgebra of @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is an ideal in @xmath40 .",
    "hence , we have a dg lie superalgebras structure on @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in @xcite",
    ", we observed that the differential vanishes on @xmath11 , and @xmath11 is often very small , so although researchers mainly study @xmath11 , the algebra @xmath40 might be more interesting than @xmath11 in some questions .",
    "observe that representing @xmath45 as @xmath46 considerably simplifies computations .",
    "in what follows , for small @xmath5 , we listed superdimensions of the @xmath47 expressed as @xmath48 ; we write @xmath34 instead of @xmath49 and @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 . for @xmath5",
    "greater than indicated below , we did not calculate ( partly due to _ mathematica_imposed limitations ) .    for lists of simple lie superalgebras , their @xmath19gradings , known",
    "central extensions , outer derivations and deformations , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . on deformations of poisson superalgebras for various types of functions , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and refs . therein . here",
    "we only consider the @xmath52dimensional case .",
    "recall that @xmath53 is the lie superalgebra of polynomial vector fields on the @xmath54dimensional superspace , @xmath55 is its divergence  free subalgebra , whereas @xmath56 and @xmath57 are exceptional finite dimensional lie superalgebras , most clearly determined by their defining relations @xcite .",
    "every @xmath19grading of @xmath10 induces a natural @xmath19grading on the space of all polynomial functions on @xmath10 , in particular , on cohomology .",
    "such @xmath19grading will be called the _",
    "degree_. observe that ( 1 ) the parity of a derivation @xmath58 is opposite to the parity of @xmath59 considered as a 1cocycle @xmath60 ; ( 2 ) to consider @xmath11 , one should shift _ all _ parities in the tables below . observe that * the deformations with the odd parameter are automatically global*.        .",
    "this algebra is highly symmetric : the group of its outer automorphisms is out  @xmath65 , so @xmath66 .",
    "we also knew that @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be induced by the degree of @xmath69 in the standard format , the even ( diagonal ) block matrices being of degree 0 , the upper / lower ones of degree @xmath70 . here",
    "are known and new results : listed are the superdimensions of the @xmath71 for @xmath72 and the degrees of their basis elements :       @xmath74&@xmath75&@xmath76&@xmath77&@xmath78&@xmath79&@xmath80&@xmath81@xmath82 & & & & & & & @xmath78 & & & 1&1&1&&@xmath83&&&&&&&@xmath79&&1&2&2&2&1&@xmath84&&&@xmath85&@xmath85&@xmath85&&@xmath80&1&2&2&2&2&2&1          .",
    "( observe that , for @xmath89 and 0 , the algebra is not simple . ) the very definition of the algebra as a 1parameter family indicates that @xmath90 .",
    "nothing was known about higher cohomology .",
    "here are new results : for @xmath91 as well as for @xmath92 which served as generic @xmath93 ( the answer is the same , but for the computer the task is much easier ) , we have @xmath73            the whole pathos of @xcite was to express @xmath11 as an _ algebra _ , not as a list of dimensions of the homogeneous components , as classics did ( borel  weil  bott  kostant ) . here",
    "the product of any two cocycles from the above table vanishes , so the list is as fine as algebra as long as the product is trivial ( even if conjecture fails ) . in examples that follow , we return , to our regret , to the list of dimensions \" level .",
    "we knew ( @xcite ) that @xmath98 for @xmath99 has only one outer derivation , so @xmath100 , and @xmath10 has only one global deformation , so @xmath90 , but we knew nothing about other cohomology .",
    "new results : indicated are nonzero @xmath47 , in all cases @xmath101 for some cocycles @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 in all cases below .",
    "the parity of @xmath102 , as an element of @xmath11 , is equal to @xmath104 .",
    "we knew ( @xcite ) that the infinite dimensional lie ( super)algebra @xmath110 of hamiltonian vector fields has only one outer derivation , and were sure that the same holds for @xmath111 ; we also knew that @xmath10 has only one global deformation , so @xmath90 .",
    "we knew nothing about other cohomology nor about the finite dimensional case .    in order not to confuse the elements of @xmath109 with functions ,",
    "we realize @xmath109 as a subalgebra of contact vector fields @xmath112 generated by functions @xmath113 ( for formulas , see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath68 be the degree of an element of @xmath10 ( and the induced degree of cochains ) given by the formula @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the standard grading in the polynomial algebra ( the degree of each indeterminate is equal to 1 ) .",
    "so , for @xmath15 , there are the following obvious cohomology : 0th , given by @xmath116 ; 1st , given by the grading by the degree ; 2nd , quantization , of @xmath117 ; and , additionally , the above cocycles wedged ( which is possible since @xmath12 is an @xmath118module ) by @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is arbitrary for @xmath121 odd and is either 0 or 1 for @xmath121 even .",
