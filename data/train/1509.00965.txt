    "one of the formidable tasks in heavy - ion physics is to identify a precise understanding of the jet - medium dynamics , the jet - medium interactions , and the jet - energy loss formalism .",
    "below , we study the influence of the details of the jet - medium coupling and the medium background on the simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath1 ) and the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow ( @xmath2 ) measured at rhic and lhc @xcite for a radiative pqcd energy - loss ansatz @xcite .",
    "we contrast media determined via the viscous hydrodynamic approach vish2 + 1 @xcite with the parton - cascade bamps @xcite as well as a jet - medium coupling depending on the collision energy with a jet - medium coupling influenced by the energy of the jet , the temperature of the medium and non - equilibrium effects around the phase transition .",
    "besides this , we compare the jet - energy loss based on radiative pqcd @xcite with the hybrid ads energy - loss ansatz of ref .",
    "we contrast the pion nuclear modification factor obtained via the radiative pqcd - energy loss @xcite and the hybrid ads energy - loss ansatz with a parton - jet nuclear modification factor that can be considered as an idealized lo jet @xmath1 at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the pqcd - based energy loss model studied is parametrized as @xcite @xmath3 with the jet - energy dependence @xmath4 , the path - length dependence @xmath5 , and the energy dependence @xmath6 . in the following ,",
    "the jet - medium coupling @xmath7 will depend either on the collision energy @xmath8 or the energy of the jet and the temperature of the background medium considered @xmath9 .",
    "the jet - energy loss fluctuations are distributed via @xmath10 , allowing for an easy interpolation between non - fluctuating ( @xmath11 ) , uniform dirac distributions and distributions increasingly skewed towards small @xmath12 .",
    "the jets are spread according to a transverse initial profile specified by the bulk flow fields given by the vish2 + 1 and bamps backgrounds considered @xcite .        on the other hand ,",
    "the jet - energy loss of the hybrid ads energy - loss ansatz @xcite is based on falling strings @xcite where @xmath13 the initial jet energy is given by @xmath14 and the string stopping distance for quark and gluon jets is determined via @xmath15 with the jet - medium coupling @xmath16 for quarks and @xmath17 for gluons , including the respective casimir operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this energy loss ansatz has been integrated into our existing model @xcite .",
    "please note that ref .",
    "@xcite uses natural units , @xmath20 . for a direct comparison , we quote our results below using a dimensionless coupling .",
    "the main differences between the two energy - loss descriptions is the square - root dependence that leads to the formation of a bragg peak with the explosive burst of energy close to the end of the jet s evolution .",
    "there have been discussions in literature @xcite on the impact of the bragg peak . in line with previous findings",
    "@xcite we will show below that there is a difference between the hybrid ads energy - loss ansatz featuring a bragg peak and the pqcd model without a bragg peak , however , this difference is only marginal .",
    "fig .  [ fig01 ] shows the pion nuclear modification factor ( @xmath1 ) for central ( left panel ) and mid - central ( middle panel ) collisions at rhic ( black ) and lhc ( red ) as well as the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow ( @xmath2 ) for mid - central events ( right ) .",
    "the measured data @xcite is compared to the pqcd - based energy loss of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath21 .",
    "jet - energy loss fluctuations ( @xmath22 ) and the transverse expansion of the background flow ( @xmath23 ) are included , as well as a running jet - medium coupling that depends on the energy of the collision , @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig01 ] demonstrates that there is a surprising similarity between the results that can not be expected a priori given the fact that the two background media are so different : while the hydrodynamic description of vish2 + 1 @xcite assumes an equilibrated system , the parton cascade bamps @xcite also includes non - equilibrium effects in the bulk medium evolution .",
    "in addition , the figure exhibits the so - called high-@xmath0 @xmath2-problem @xcite : the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow below @xmath24  gev is about a factor of two below the measured data @xcite .",
    "this effect has been discussed in literature @xcite and recently it has been suggested by cujet3.0 @xcite that a temperature and energy - dependent jet - medium coupling @xmath9 , which includes non - perturbative effects around the phase transition of @xmath25  mev , can overcome this problem .",
    "this jet - medium coupling was derived from the dglv gluon number distribution @xcite and is given by the analytic formul @xmath26 it includes a running coupling @xmath27 with @xmath28 , the polyakov - loop suppression of the color - electric scattering @xcite via @xmath29 with pre - factors @xmath30 for quarks and gluons , and the polyakov loop @xmath31 as parametrized from lattice qcd , as well as an enhancement of scattering due to the magnetic monopoles near the critical temperature @xmath32 also derived from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "this temperature and energy - dependent jet - medium coupling shows an effective running as it decreases with temperature .",
    "we included the above jet - medium coupling @xmath9 in our jet - energy loss approach @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , again for the hydrodynamic background vish2 + 1 ( solid lines ) and a medium determined via the parton cascade bamps ( dashed lines ) . for comparison",
    ", we depict the results from cujet3.0 @xcite .    as in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , the ion nuclear modification factor is well described both at rhic and lhc . the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow , however , increases drastically below @xmath24  gev as compared to fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , especially for the bamps background which already includes non - equilibrium effects @xcite .    finally , we compare results from the linear pqcd approach of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) with the highly non - linear hybrid ads holographic model of jet - energy loss , see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we compare the pion nuclear modification factor and an idealized lo jet @xmath1 given by @xmath33 naturally , this lo jet @xmath1 represents a reconstructed jet with vanishing cone radius and is only a lower bound for the nlo jet @xmath1 with jet - cone radii @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig03 ] shows this comparison at lhc ( left ) and rhic ( right ) energies for two different jet - medium couplings that are treated as constants : a larger one ( red ) fitted to the pion @xmath1 data ( dashed - dotted lines ) at rhic and a lower one ( blue ) fitted the pion @xmath1 data at lhc .    to guide the eye",

    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "the solid blue lines for the lo jet @xmath1 in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] lie in the same ballpark as the experimental data . fragmenting this result to pions ( dashed - dotted lines ) leads to an @xmath1 that reproduces the measured pion nuclear modification factor at lhc .",
    "a straight extrapolation of this results to rhic energies shows that the lo jet @xmath1 for _ the same _ jet medium couplings lie on top of the measured _ pion _ nuclear modification factor .",
    "however , fragmenting this result to pions leads to a @xmath36 that is larger than the measured data at rhic .",
    "larger jet - medium couplings ( red lines ) , on the other hand , describe the _ pion _ nuclear modification factor at rhic for the pqcd scenario and the lo jet @xmath1 at lhc is again close to the experimental data .",
    "the pion nuclear modification factor at lhc , however , only touches the lower bound of present error bars . in case of the hybrid ads energy loss",
    "the results always only touch the lower end of the experimental error bars .",
    "[ fig03 ] demonstrates that the results for the pqcd and the hybrid ads energy - loss including a bragg peak are remarkably similar .",
    "thus , unfortunately , neither the pion nor a lo jet @xmath1 are sensitive to the difference in the path - length between pqcd and ads models .",
    "we compared the measured data on the nuclear modification factor for pions and reconstructed jets as well as on the high-@xmath0 elliptic flow at rhic and lhc energies to results obtained by a linear pqcd and a highly non - linear hybrid ads holographic model of jet - energy loss .",
    "we found that the simultaneous description of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 requires a jet - medium coupling that depends on the energy of the jet , the temperature of the medium @xcite , and non - equilibrium effects around the phase transition .",
    "we also contrasted a hydrodynamic background ( vish2 + 1 ) @xcite with a medium obtained from the parton cascade bamps @xcite and showed that the influence of the underlying bulk medium considered is suprisingly small .",
