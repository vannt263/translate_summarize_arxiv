    "the currently most widely - accepted ` standard model ' of cosmology holds that the vast majority of the mass density of the universe is hidden in dark forms .",
    "the rotation curves of galaxies and the dynamics of galaxy clusters can not be accounted for by the gravitation of visible stars and gas , while constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis studies imply that the additional ` dark matter ' postulated to remedy this discrepancy must be non - baryonic . on a cosmological level ,",
    "collisionless ( or very weakly collisional ) dark matter is required if primordial density perturbations of amplitude @xmath4 are to grow quickly enough to form galaxies by the present epoch . finally , recent determinations of the high redshift type ia supernova hubble diagram , in tandem with microwave background data implying a flat cosmic geometry , and a large collection of data indicating that clustering matter only contributes @xmath5 of the critical density , imply that the universe also contains ` dark energy ' of a yet more exotic form which causes acceleration in the cosmic expansion ( see , e.g. , peebles 1999 and turner 1999 for recent reviews ) .",
    "discomfort with this repeated postulation of invisible matter with increasingly unusual properties has led some , quite reasonably , to ask whether the observed phenomena could be accounted for not by the presence of unseen matter , but by a departure from newtonian / einsteinian dynamics in the regime where dark matter is hypothesized to be important .",
    "perhaps the most successful of such proposals is the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by milgrom ( 1983a , b , c ) , in which newtonian dynamics breaks down below an acceleration threshold of @xmath6 .",
    "successes of this theory are that it accounts for the rotation curves of galaxies of various luminosities ( sanders & verheijen 1998 ) and surface brightnesses ( de blok & mcgaugh 1998 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) , accounts for the tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations ( van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ; sanders 1996 , 2000 ) , and  arguably  roughly accounts for the amount of dark matter inferred in clusters ( sanders 1999 ) .    despite some attempts , mond has not been generalized into a satisfactory relativistic theory which can yield unambiguous cosmological predictions .",
    "scott et al . ( 2001 ) explore the difficulties in applying mond to cosmology and review a number of claimed conceptual and empirical difficulties with mond .",
    "but in light of mond s general success when applied to galaxies , and the current lack of any decisive empirical argument against it , it is worth investigating whether mond works in detail in systems for which it was not designed yet makes relatively unambiguous predictions , and for which good observations are available .",
    "we propose and perform two such tests .",
    "first , we deduce basic properties of the ly@xmath0 absorbers , making use of the technique of schaye ( 2001 ) .",
    "these can be compared directly to observations concerning the sizes and number densities of the absorbers .",
    "second , we derive relations between the density , enclosed mass , and temperature profiles of galaxy clusters which can be directly compared to available x - ray data .",
    "both ly@xmath0 absorbers and clusters constitute relatively simple physical systems , are well within the mond regime , and ( in the absence of dark matter ) are dominated by gas which can be accurately observed , making them ideal testing grounds for mond .",
    "as argued by schaye ( 2001 ; hereafter s01 ) , basic properties of the gas responsible for ly@xmath0 absorption in quasar spectra can be deduced using simple physical arguments . along any sightline passing through a gas ` cloud ' ,",
    "the size of the region dominating the absorption will typically be of order the local jeans length , regardless of the overall shape of the cloud and regardless of whether the cloud as a whole is in dynamical equilibrium . using this reasoning",
    ", s01 calculates properties of the ly@xmath0 absorbers which are in good agreement with numerical simulations and available observations . because the absorbers are dynamically simple and have very low characteristic accelerations , mond makes strong predictions about their properties , which we will now derive in parallel to the treatment by s01 .",
    "mond can be formulated in a number of ways , either as a modification of inertia ( e.g. , milgrom 1999 ) or of gravity ( e.g. , bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) . in its most general incarnation ,",
    "the gravitational acceleration in an ` isolated ' ( meaning not embedded in a gravitational field with larger characteristic acceleration ) system is given by @xmath7 when @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the acceleration calculated using newtonian gravity , and @xmath10 ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) is the mond acceleration parameter .",
    "( systems which _ are _ embedded in a large external field are discussed below ) .",
    "this acceleration law yields a dynamical time @xmath11^{1/4 } ,   \\label{eq - tdyn}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the characteristic size and density of the system , respectively , @xmath14 is the hydrogen number density in a medium of hydrogen mass fraction @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the proton mass . the system s sound - crossing time is unchanged by mond and is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the temperature , @xmath19 is the assumed adiabatic index and @xmath20 is the mean molecular weight per particle for a fully ionized primordial plasma with @xmath21 . setting these timescales equal to each other yields the jean length @xmath22 this can be converted to a column density @xmath23 using the ionization correction from s01 , valid for a highly ionized , optically thin plasma : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the recombination and ionization rates with @xmath27k ; @xmath28 is measured at redshift @xmath29 ( see scott et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the resulting jeans column density can be expressed as a function of overdensity @xmath30 , as @xmath31^{5/3}(1+z)^5 \\\\ \\nonumber & \\approx & 3.6\\times10^{12}{\\,\\rm cm^{-2}}\\,t_4^{-0.09}\\gamma_{12}^{-1}\\left({\\omega_b h^2\\over 0.02}\\right)^{5/3 } \\\\ & & \\times(1+\\delta)^{5/3}\\left({1+z\\over 4}\\right)^5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27k , @xmath32 is the current critical density and @xmath33 is the baryonic density parameter .",
    "thus isolated ly@xmath0 absorbers of density equal to the cosmic mean have about ten times lower column density than in the cdm picture , with different dependences on @xmath18 , @xmath34 , etc .",
    "one can also express the jeans length in terms of the observed hi column density : @xmath35^{1/5 } \\\\   & \\approx & 11\\,{\\rm kpc}\\left({n_{h i}\\over10^{14}{\\rm cm^{-2}}}\\right)^{-1/5 } \\gamma_{12}^{-1/5}t_4^{0.65 } , \\label{eq - absz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] about a factor of ten smaller than an absorber of the same column density in the cdm picture ( s01 , eq .",
    "12 ) , and with different scalings for all parameters .",

    "the internal acceleration is then @xmath37 .",
    "second , the system s dynamical time is @xmath38 whereas the hubble time ( as indicated by observations ) . ] is @xmath39s for @xmath40 , so the absorbers are self - consistently in local hydrostatic equilibrium ( assuming they can _ reach _ this equilibrium ; see below ) .",
    "the method of s01 can also be used to ` invert ' the observed column density distribution into an estimate of the total mass density in ly@xmath0 absorbers , using @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the differential number of observed lines of column density @xmath43 at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "the preceding calculation applies to an isolated absorber , but because the strong equivalence principle is violated in mond , the internal dynamics of systems can change if they are embedded in an external acceleration field @xmath44 , even if it is homogeneous ( i.e. , @xmath45 with coordinates such that @xmath46 is the external field direction ) .",
    "milgrom ( 1986 ) shows that in the lagrangian formulation of mond ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) , if @xmath47 is small compared to @xmath48 but large compared to the internal accelerations of a system , then gravity in the subsystem is newtonian in the coordinate system @xmath49 with an effective newton s constant @xmath50 . in this case ,",
    "properties of the absorbers in mond can be computed directly from the corresponding newtonian / cdm expressions from s01 , with those substitutions .. ] for example , the size of the absorbing region is then @xmath51 in the direction perpendicular to the external field , and somewhat ( about two times ) longer in the parallel direction .",
    "the density parameter in ly@xmath0 absorption systems is given by the cdm calculation of s01 , adjusted by a factor of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the gas - to - matter mass ratio in the cdm calculation .",
    "the above analysis gives two quite testable predictions concerning the ly@xmath0 forest in mond .",
    "first , the total density of gas can be computed using eq .",
    "[ eq - omgas ] ( for the isolated case ) or eq .",
    "16 of s01 ( for the external field case ) .",
    "since ly@xmath0 systems are very deep in the mond regime , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that this density will be at all reasonable ( i.e. , as compared to the nucleosynthesis value of @xmath33 ) , and this can be assessed .",
    "second , the characteristic sizes of absorbers , given by eqs .",
    "[ eq - absz ] and  [ eq - absz2 ] , can be compared to observations of lensed quasars and quasar pairs that constrain the transverse sizes of absorbers . in making both comparisons",
    ", the external field case requires a value for the mean acceleration field of ly@xmath0 absorbers at @xmath54 this is currently not calculable , but may be crudely estimated . at @xmath55 ,",
    "typical mean observed accelerations can be obtained by dividing typical bulk flow velocities of @xmath56 ( see , e.g. , dekel et al .",
    "1999 ; dale et al .",
    "1999 ) by a hubble time , yielding @xmath57 ; we shall take an upper limit of @xmath58 . if the fluctuations in the newtonian gravitational potential ( which in linear theory are constant in time in an einstein  de sitter cosmology ) do not shrink , then @xmath59",
    "this is an upper limit , and the accelerations could be significantly smaller at @xmath60 in a mond universe if the potential fluctuations have grown considerably since then . from eq .",
    "[ eq - aint ] above , we see that an external field @xmath61 is required to modify the absorber internal dynamics .",
    "thus we can consistently consider external fields with @xmath62    we have computed the total gas density in ly@xmath0 absorbers in both the isolated and non - isolated cases using the data of hu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and petitjean et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . in the isolated case we find @xmath63",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the @xmath64 inferred from the same data in the cdm picture or using nucleosynthesis , but is still plausible  even if we assume that most baryons must be in gas in the igm  considering the uncertainty inherent in the analysis and the neglect of underdense and collisionally ionized hot gas .",
    "in the case of a significant external field , we find @xmath65 giving @xmath66 ; the higher end is in comfortable agreement with observational constraints .    for isolated absorbers",
    ", mond also predicts that the low column density ( @xmath67 ) absorbers have a rather small characteristic size : @xmath68 versus @xmath69 for newtonian gravity with cdm .",
    "we have argued that in a plausible external field , the absorbers should have sizes of @xmath70kpc in their long direction , and half this in their short direction .",
    "spectra of lensed quasars and close quasar pairs can be used to constrain the characteristic transverse sizes of ly@xmath0 absorbers .",
    "on very small ( few kpc ) scales , absorbers are virtually identical in both sight - lines ( smette et al .",
    "1992 ; dolan et al .",
    "2000 ) . on intermediate ( tens of kpc )",
    "scales spectra are very similar but are currently too low - resolution to conclusively constrain the absorber properties across the sight - lines ( e.g. , bechtold et al .",
    "1994 ; smette et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the largest scales , statistical analyses of the probability of detecting an absorber in both sight - lines lead to estimates of absorber ` sizes ' of several hundred kpc ( e.g. , dinshaw et al .",
    "1995 ; smette et al .",
    "1995 ; crotts & fang 1998 ; dodorico et al .",
    "these observations are slightly at odds with the mond predictions unless @xmath47 is near its upper limit , but some additional considerations must be kept in mind :    1 .   except on very small scales ,",
    "the observations do not currently rigorously distinguish between correlated absorbers and a single absorber spanning two sight - lines .",
    "so we can not directly compare the observationally deduced sizes ( several hundred kpc ) to the jeans length of absorbers of the observed column density ( eqs .",
    "[ eq - absz ] and  [ eq - absz2 ] ) .",
    "2 .   strictly speaking , the relations given in eqs .",
    "[ eq - absz ] and  [ eq - absz2 ] connect observed column density to radial dimension whereas the observations probe the transverse extent ( or correlation ) .",
    "however , for an ` isolated ' absorbing region these dimensions are unlikely to be very different because absorbers should vary transversely on a scale comparable to the local jeans length , which is in turn comparable to the radial extent over which the absorption occurs . in the case of a strong external field ,",
    "the absorbers should be elongated in the field direction by a factor of two .",
    "3 .   the properties of absorbers derived here assume that the absorbers are not far from local dynamical equilibrium , which would _ not _ be true for underdense and/or very large ( @xmath71kpc ) absorbers with dynamical times exceeding the hubble time .",
    "for isolated absorbers , it can be shown that regions of this size could not give rise to sufficient absorption unless their dynamical time _ is _ shorter than the hubble time . to see this , note that requiring @xmath72 for a fixed @xmath12 gives an upper limit on density via eq .",
    "[ eq - tdyn ] , and this in turn gives an upper limit to column density of @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "this means that isolated @xmath75kpc absorbers of column density @xmath76 can not consistently be far from local dynamical equilibrium .",
    "absorbers in an external potential @xmath47 can be out - of - equilibrium if their column density obeys @xmath77 thus absorbers in a strong external field may be only marginally in equilibrium .    in summary",
    ", we find that if the dynamics of ly@xmath0 absorbers in mond are dominated by their self - gravity , then they are significantly smaller than observations indicate . if , however , the clouds are immersed in a ( constant ) acceleration field of magnitude @xmath47 , then their sizes can be substantially larger , and the basic properties of ly@xmath0 absorbers approach those predicted by standard gravity ( with cdm ) as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the density parameters in absorbing gas and dark matter in the cdm model .",
    "the importance of external fields in low - acceleration systems is both a methodological barrier and a saving grace of mond .",
    "the accurate description of such systems requires a ( necessarily ab - initio ) calculation of the large - scale density field surrounding them , which is in turn impossible to perform rigorously without a cosmological formulation of mond which treats its conceptual problems ( in particular the issue of which accelerations , and with respect to what , should be ` counted ' ) . on the other hand , external fields",
    "can ensure that in the limit of extremely low accelerations the properties of isolated systems in mond will not deviate wildly from their newtonian counterparts .",
    "like ly@xmath0 systems , clusters of galaxies are gas - dominated ( in the absence of dark matter ) , well observed ( this time via x - ray measurements ) , should be in local hydrostatic equilibrium , and are in the mond acceleration regime .",
    "they also have internal accelerations larger than expected ambient acceleration fields ( and comparable to those near galaxies ) .",
    "thus strong predictions regarding their structure in mond can be made using relatively simple arguments , as follows .    for a gaseous system of mass @xmath81 in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", @xmath81 is close to the jeans mass @xmath82 . for pure gas with mondian gravity , @xmath83 using eq .",
    "[ eq - mondjl ] . for comparison ,",
    "the observed mass - temperature relation of clusters found by mohr , mathiesen , & evrard ( 1999 ) is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the enclosed mass of the x - ray gas at the radius within which its density is approximately 500 times the cosmic mean . while only an order - of - magnitude estimate , eq .",
    "[ eq - mondmt ] would at first seem to be a remarkable success of mond , since the cdm picture has difficulty explaining the observed mass - temperature relation in detail ( see , e.g. , mohr et al .",
    "1999 ; finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the fact that mond can roughly account ( to within a factor of two ) for the mass discrepancy in clusters has been pointed out by sanders ( 1999 ) . but a hint of trouble is suggested by the fact that eq .",
    "[ eq - obsmt ] applies for a particular radius , whereas for isothermal clusters",
    "[ eq - mondmt ] does not .",
    "a closer look reveals that serious problems arise when the temperature profile @xmath86 predicted by mond for a given density profile @xmath87 is compared to observations .",
    "consider a spherical system such as a cluster in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "then the temperature and density obey @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the magnitude of the radial gravitational acceleration , and @xmath90 is the pressure . for @xmath91 in mond ,",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath92^{1/2 } , \\label{eq - he}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the enclosed mass .",
    "this equation immediately implies that if @xmath87 and @xmath86 are power laws , then @xmath94 , as per the jeans argument .",
    "more generally , an increasing @xmath93 implies that @xmath86 increases as long as the sum of @xmath95 and @xmath96 changes more slowly than @xmath97 .",
    "thus isothermal density profiles in mond tend to have a core which contains most of the mass ( and in which the logarithmic derivatives change relatively quickly ) , then fall off more quickly than @xmath98 ( see milgom 1984 ) .",
    "we will show that this is _ not _ the case for the x - ray emitting gas that dominates the mass in observed clusters , yet clusters are observed to be nearly isothermal outside of their central regions .",
    "this constitutes a grave challenge to mond which can be demonstrated using the specific cases of the virgo , abell 2199 , and coma clusters , for which gas density , stellar mass , and temperature profiles are available in the literature .",

    "the lower - right panel shows this prediction , integrating inward starting at @xmath108mpc , with @xmath107 taking values between 1/10th and ten times the measured asca temperature there .",
    "if mond were correct , one of these profiles should roughly match the observed temperatures , but none of them do .",
    "figures  [ fig - cluster2 ] and  [ fig - cluster3 ] shows the same analysis for abell 2199 and coma , somewhat richer and more relaxed clusters .",
    "the results are quite similar .",
    "we have verified that the results are robust to reasonable changes in the distances to the clusters , the mean molecular weight , and the mond interpolation formula used .",
    "we have also experimented with different profiles and normalizations for the stellar mass distribution ; these do not significantly affect the results unless the stellar mass is so large ( @xmath109 ) as to imply the presence of dark matter ( dark matter is discussed below ) .",
    "significantly larger values of the mond constant ( @xmath110 ) help improve the fit because ( as demonstrated by the agreement of eqs .",
    "[ eq - mondmt ] and  [ eq - obsmt ] ) , the mond ` jeans temperature ' @xmath111 roughly agrees with observed cluster temperatures _ at large radii_. increasing @xmath48 moves this agreement to intermediate radii , but still can not yield a reasonable fit of the entire profile ( and would be incompatible with the value required by galaxy rotation curves and make ly@xmath0 absorbers even smaller ) .",
    "as alluded to above , the difficulty in accounting for the cluster data in mond  even when @xmath48 is allowed to vary  can be understood in more general terms using an inequality derived from eq .",

    "but then @xmath117 requires ( in mond ) that @xmath118 , while @xmath119 is observed .",
    "both power - law indices and total baryonic mass are very well constrained quantities , so this is a serious violation .",

    "therefore if @xmath123 at any radius within which the cluster has a non - rising temperature , and within which the density profile is well fit by a @xmath101model , then mond is violated .",
    "if @xmath86 is exactly constant , the constraint is stronger and @xmath124 violates mond .",
    "since the relevant properties of virgo , a2199 and coma ( isothermal or radially declining temperatures , increasing @xmath93 , and slowly changing @xmath125 as in the @xmath120-model ) seem generic in clusters at large radii ( neumann & arnaud 1999 ; finoguenov , david , & ponman 2000 ; irwin , bregman , & evrard 1999 ) , it is very hard to see how to reconcile mond with the observations .",
    "a few possibilities which do _ not _ seem able to satisfactorily effect this reconciliation are :    the @xmath55 hubble time greatly exceeds the dynamical time ( see bottom - left panel of each figure ) and the sound - crossing time , inside @xmath126mpc , so hydrostatic equilibrium should hold within that radius ( see sarazin 1988 for some discussion ) .",
    "moreover , simulations ( albeit in the cdm picture ) show that hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry are good assumptions in inferring the gravitational force given observed density and temperature profiles ( schindler 1996 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the observed magnetic fields in clusters do not appear sufficiently strong to significantly affect the force balance or the inferred cluster bulk properties ( e.g. , goncalves & friaca 1999 ; dolag , evrard , & bartelmann 2001 ) .    _",

    "more generally , there is no indication in observations using asca ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",

    "however ( and regardless of whether or not @xmath131 ) , the cluster density profile would respond to this conduction by readjusting to restore hydrostatic equilibrium on a dynamical time .",
    "but then ( by an inverted version of the argument given above ) , mond would predict a density profile with quickly - varying logarithmic derivatives , contradicting the observed density profile .",

    "this yielded @xmath93 somewhat larger than the observed mass .",
    "milgrom ( 1993 ) criticized this approach and suggested a different one similar to that employed here .",
    "using the coma cluster , the & white ( 1988 ) tested whether they could generate a set of @xmath87 , @xmath93 and @xmath86 in mond that could match the observations available at that time .",
    "they succeeded , but only by using @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( which are not now observationally viable ) .",
    "we have reproduced their calculations , but find that even with their parameters , the now - available accurate temperature profile of coma can not be fit .",
    "thus it seems that while mond can account for the non - keplerian form of galactic rotation curves ( and  somewhat surprisingly  for the mass - temperature relation in clusters ) , it can not account for cluster density and temperature profiles in detail .",
    "the difference in success derives from the fact that  roughly speaking  in mond",
    "an asymptotically isothermal temperature profile corresponds to a point mass , whereas clusters are extended yet still in the mond acceleration regime . in cdm",
    "cosmology the isothermality of both galaxies and clusters is explained by assuming that both are embedded in an isothermal dark halo which dominates the mass .",
    "mond as an alternative to the dark matter hypothesis has generally fared quite well when applied to galaxies .",
    "however , galaxies can only test mond in the limited regime of accelerations of ( 0.1 - 1)@xmath48 and physical scales of @xmath151kpc .",
    "it is therefore important to discover whether mond s success extends to systems at much lower accelerations and/or much greater physical scales . to this end , we have predicted various properties of ly@xmath0 absorbers and galaxy clusters in mond , using hydrostatic equilibrium arguments . both types of systems are observationally well constrained , and well within the mond acceleration regime .",
    "we find that as compared to their properties in the cdm picture , the ly@xmath0 absorbers in mond have somewhat higher characteristic density and smaller characteristic size for a given column density , potentially in conflict with absorption studies of quasar pairs and lenses .",
    "the magnitude of the effect , however , depends upon the ( unknown ) magnitude of the external acceleration field in which they embedded , since mond violates the strong equivalence principle , and if the ambient acceleration field is large then the predicted absorber properties can approach those observed . when combined with the observed differential number density of absorption lines , the analysis yields ( for any assumed external field ) a reasonable density of intergalactic gas ( as does the cdm picture )",
    ". a more accurate prediction of the detailed physical and statistical properties of ly@xmath0 absorbers in mond  which match observations in detail in the cdm case  will probably require a ( presently infeasible ) ab - initio calculation of the large - scale acceleration field and the absorbers themselves .",
    "we note also that the mond jeans mass depends only on temperature : @xmath152 and gives a rather small jeans mass in the igm which may dramatically alter galaxy formation in mond ( though we have not pursued that issue here ) .",
    "simple arguments can also predict the mass - temperature relation in clusters , and the temperature profile of any single cluster given its observed gas density and enclosed mass profile .",
    "the mond - predicted m - t relation is impressively close to the observed one , though this success seems coincidental , as it is sensitive to the radius at which the enclosed mass is measured ( since in mond the jeans mass depends only on the temperature and the clusters are roughly isothermal ) .",
    "stronger constraints can be derived using the observed mass , temperature , and density profiles of clusters : given hydrostatic equilibrium , mond directly predicts the relation between the three quantities . for the form of mass and gas density profiles",
    "generally observed , mond predicts rising temperature profiles . in the specific cases of the virgo , abell 2199 , and coma clusters",
    ", we have shown that mond s predictions strongly disagree with measurements from asca , rosat , bepposax and xmm , and we see no reasonable way to effect a reconciliation without recourse to large amounts of ( presumably baryonic ) dark matter of an unknown type .",
    "for these clusters , the mass of such dark matter must exceed the gas mass within @xmath2mpc by a factor of @xmath153 , and by a factor of about ten within @xmath154kpc .",
    "moreover , we have argued that the discrepancy applies to clusters in general .",
    "this may be interpreted as a failure of mond to describe cluster dynamics in terms of their observed baryonic content , or as a bold prediction ( sanders 1999 ) that we have so far observed only a minority of their baryonic content .",
    "( discovery of such dark matter would also constitute a serious crisis for the cdm model . )    in conclusion , we find that although mond can explain the rotation curves of galaxies in a simple and compelling way , it is less effective in extended systems such as clusters and ( perhaps ) intergalactic gas clouds , in which the visible mass can not be described as a gravitational point mass when the system is in the mond regime .",
    "this implies that dark matter ( or perhaps some different modification of gravity ) is required to accurately describe such systems .",
