    "microwave resonators , also known as `` microwave billiards '' , are ideal systems to study properties of chaotic quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "most studies have focused on the statistical properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , especially on tests of the bohigas - giannoni - schmit  @xcite conjecture . according to that conjecture ,",
    "the spectral fluctuation properties of quantum systems with chaotic classical dynamics coincide with those of random - matrix ensembles belonging to the same symmetry class . that statement holds up to level spacings determined by the period of the shortest periodic orbit of the system .",
    "we comment on that point below .",
    "data are taken by coupling the resonators via one or several antennas to sources or sinks of a microwave power supply .",
    "because of this arrangement , microwave resonators can also be viewed as open quantum systems , and measurements of the reflected and transmitted intensity amplitudes provide generic information on chaotic quantum scattering , each antenna acting as a single scattering channel  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on measurements of the complex transmission and reflection amplitudes of chaotic microwave billiards , and on the theoretical analysis of such data . for the latter we use the generic approach to chaotic quantum scattering based on random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "we have used two types of microwave resonators . in the first one , time - reversal ( @xmath1 ) invariance holds and in the second one",
    ", it is violated by placing a magnetized ferrite within the cavity .",
    "the large set of scattering data taken with either device ( considerably larger than data sets collected , for instance , in nuclear physics ) allows us to test the rmt approach to chaotic scattering with unprecedented accuracy , both for systems that are @xmath2invariant and for those that are not .",
    "most experimental investigations of chaotic scattering have been restricted to measure cross sections rather than individual elements of the scattering matrix @xmath0 . in our setup",
    "we use a vector network analyzer to actually measure modulus and phase of the reflected and of the transmitted amplitudes and , thus , of individual @xmath0-matrix elements .",
    "the additional information garnered in this way increases the significance of our tests .",
    "in addition to testing the rmt approach to chaotic scattering , we propose and test a method for the determination of the strength of @xmath2violation from data on @xmath0-matrix correlation functions .",
    "this is of particular significance for those chaotic quantum scattering systems for which the relevant parameters can not be determined easily by dynamical calculations such as the semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "some of our results have already briefly been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath1-invariant systems statistical cross - section fluctuations have been thoroughly investigated experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions in the regime of isolated nuclear resonances  @xcite ( average resonance spacing @xmath3 very large compared to average resonance width @xmath4 ) and in the ericson regime  @xcite ( @xmath5 ) , especially in nuclei  @xcite , but also in several other systems  @xcite .",

    "@xmath1-invariance violation caused by an external magnetic field has also been studied in electron transport through quantum dots  @xcite and other devices  @xcite and in ultrasound transmission in rotational flows  @xcite .",
    "the rmt approach to @xmath1-invariance violation  @xcite used in some of these papers is likewise tested very precisely in the present paper .",
    "the theoretical approach to chaotic scattering is based on an expression for the @xmath0-matrix originally derived in the context of nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "that expression contains explicitly the hamiltonian matrix of the system . replacing the actual hamiltonian by a @xmath1-invariant random - matrix ensemble , one generates an ensemble of @xmath0-matrices which describes generic features of chaotic scattering .",
    "analytical expressions for the @xmath0-matrix correlation functions of that ensemble which apply for all values of @xmath7 have been derived  @xcite .",
    "these are used in our analysis . replacing the hamiltonian by an ensemble of random matrices with",
    "partially broken @xmath2invariance  @xcite , one similarly generates an ensemble of @xmath0-matrices that describes generic features of chaotic scattering with broken @xmath2invariance .",
    "some properties of that ensemble have been worked out previously  @xcite . to compare with our data we had to extend the theoretical results .",
    "this work is also reported in the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : expt ] we describe the experimental setup and some typical results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measures ] we define the statistical measures in terms of @xmath0-matrix elements and use these to analyze the data . in particular , we define a measure that quantifies the strength of @xmath1-invariance violation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] and in the appendix we sketch the derivation of analytic expressions for the statistical measures .",
    "we use the method of ref .",
    "the theory contains a number of parameters .",
    "these are fitted to data .",
    "we test the theory with the help of a goodness - of - fit ( gof ) test in sec .",
    "[ sec : gof ] .",
    "the basic assumption for the applicability of the gof test is that the distribution of the fourier - transformed @xmath0-matrix elements are gaussian and uncorrelated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ftdistrib ] we demonstrate the validity of that assumption for chaotic scattering systems . in the case of @xmath1-invariance violation ,",
    "we test the theory further by comparing experimental values for the elastic enhancement factor and for the distribution of the diagonal @xmath0-matrix elements with theoretical predictions based on parameter fits to other observables .",
    "for an experimental study of universal fluctuation properties of chaotic scattering systems we used flat , cylindrical microwave resonators with the emitting and receiving antennas acting as single scattering channels .",
    "as long as the excitation frequency @xmath8 is chosen below @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the height of the resonator and @xmath11 is the speed of light , only transverse magnetic tm@xmath12 modes can be excited , and the electrical field vector is perpendicular to the top and the bottom plates of the resonator .",
    "then , the associated helmholtz equation for the electric field strength is scalar and mathematically identical to the two - dimensional schrdinger equation of a particle elastically reflected by the contour of the microwave resonator , i.e. , of a quantum billiard  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed with resonators whose contour has the shape of a tilted stadium billiard  @xcite . that shape was chosen to avoid bouncing - ball orbits .",
    "each microwave resonator was constructed from three metallic plates .",
    "the bottom and the top of the resonator are formed by two 5  mm thick high - purity copper plates . the center plate had a hole in the shape of a tilted quarter stadium .",
    "the thickness of that plate determined the height of the resonator and differed for the two experiments .",
    "the quality factor q increases with the height of the resonator .",
    "thus , to ensure a high q value the center plate for the @xmath1-invariant case had a thickness of 14.6  mm ( so that @xmath13 ) .",
    "the plate was made of brass  @xcite to technically permit the cutting - out of the hole . for the case with broken @xmath2invariance a copper plate with a thickness of 5.0  mm , which coincided with the height of the ferrite described below ,",
    "was used ( so that @xmath14 ) , see  ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to make sure that",
    "only tm@xmath12 modes are excited , the excitation frequency @xmath8 was actually chosen @xmath15 .",
    "screws through the top , middle and bottom plates ensured the good electrical contact needed to achieve high - quality values of the resonator .",
    "two thin wires ( diameter about 0.5  mm ) intrude 2.5  mm into the cavity through small holes ( diameter about 2  mm ) drilled into the lid of the resonator .",
    "they act as dipole antennas to couple the rf power into and out of the resonator . a vector network analyzer ( vna ) provided the rf signal at a variable frequency @xmath8 and recorded the signal received at the same ( other ) antenna for reflection ( transmission ) measurements .",
    "the two signals were compared by the vna in amplitude and phase to determine the complex - valued @xmath0-matrix elements .",

    "@xcite.,width=302 ]    for a precise experimental determination of the elements of the @xmath0-matrix all systematic and statistical errors must be minimized .",
    "the coaxial lines connecting the vna with the cavity are the dominant source for systematic errors .",
    "they attenuate and reflect the rf signal .",
    "both effects were removed by a proper calibration of the vna .",
    "systematic errors are also caused by the transmission properties of the two antennas . to account for these , the reflection spectrum of a small cylindrical resonator ( diameter 5  mm , depth 20  mm ) was measured using the same antenna geometry as in the actual experiment .",
    "the first resonance is located well above 30  ghz .",
    "thus , in the frequency range of interest and for an ideal coupling of the antennas to the resonator all rf power would be reflected .",
    "any deviation from this expectation was attributed to the antennas .",
    "the resulting correction was applied to the measured spectra in the actual experiments .",
    "the corrected values of the reflection and transmission spectra with the two antennas @xmath17 and @xmath16 provided the elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the complex @xmath20 @xmath0-matrix as functions of the frequency @xmath8 .",

    "the resulting errors were several orders of magnitude smaller than the signal and , thus , negligible .",
    "the data were analyzed in frequency intervals of @xmath17 ghz length yielding @xmath30 data points each .",
    "the limited number of statistically independent data points in every such frequency interval causes finite - range - of - data ( frd ) errors . to increase the number of data points and to reduce the frd errors  @xcite , in some of the experiments a small scatterer ( an iron disc , 20  mm diameter ) was introduced into the microwave resonator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tilted_stadium ] ) and moved to six different positions .",
    "we then speak of different _ realizations _ of the scattering system .",
    "experiments with violated @xmath2invariance were done with a magnetized ferrite embedded within the resonator .",
    "such _ induced _ time - reversal - invariance violation ( triv ) has been studied in numerous works  @xcite .",

    "it was provided by courtesy of aft materials gmbh ( backnang , germany ) .",
    "two ndfeb magnets ( cylindrical shape , 20  mm diameter and 10  mm height ) were placed outside the billiard at the position of the ferrite to provide the required magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom plates of the resonator .",
    "the distance between the magnets and the ferrite could be adjusted by a screw thread mechanism , and field strengths of up to 360  mt could be achieved at the position of the ferrite . with this setup triv",
    "is induced via the following mechanism . because of the external magnetic field @xmath34 the ferrite effectively acquires a macroscopic magnetization @xmath35 that precesses with the larmor frequency @xmath36 around @xmath34 .",
    "this is the origin of the _ ferromagnetic resonance_. the rf magnetic field inside the cavity is elliptically polarized and can be decomposed into two field components of opposite circular polarization with , in general , different amplitudes . due to the larmor precession of the magnetization @xmath35 the spins of the ferrite couple",
    "differently to the two magnetic field components .",
    "a reversal of time , simulated by an interchange of the input and output channels , swaps the rotational sense of the two field components and thus , due to their different amplitudes , effectively changes the coupling of the ferrite to the resonator mode .",
    "the induced triv is strongest if the frequency @xmath8 is close to that of the ferromagnetic resonance . the experiments with the embedded ferrite demanded a reduction of the height of the resonator to 5.0  mm , as the ferrite itself was only 5  mm in height .",

    "the first dip can be attributed to the ferromagnetic resonance which in our case is located at 6.6  ghz .",
    "we assume that the other two dips arise from an enhancement of the influence of the ferromagnetic resonance by standing rf magnetic fields inside the ferrite . yet , the smallest values ( @xmath71 ) obtained are well above zero .",
