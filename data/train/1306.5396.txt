    "the linear magnetoelectric response of a solid is the linear order magnetization induced by an electric field or equivalently the linear order electric polarization induced by a magnetic field .",
    "it is described by a second - rank tensor , @xmath2 , which can be non - zero when both time - reversal and space - inversion symmetries are broken , and may have diagonal or off - diagonal components , corresponding to a response parallel or perpendicular to the applied field respectively .",
    "materials with anti - symmetric off - diagonal linear magnetoelectric responses have the same symmetry as the toroidal component of the second - order term in the magnetic multipole expansion , and so there has been much recent discussion in the literature of whether the toroidal moment , @xmath3 , is a relevant and useful concept for describing such magnetoelectric effects . in particular , the term _ ferrotoroidics _ has been introduced to describe materials in which the toroidal moments are aligned cooperatively , and such materials",
    "have been considered to complete the group of primary ferroics.@xcite motivated by this suggestion , a theory of _ toroidization _  defined to be the toroidal moment per unit volume  in bulk crystalline solids has been developed , which appropriately treats the multi - valuedness caused by the periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "ferrotoroidic switching has been reported @xcite , and attempts to demonstrate that the toroidal moment can act as a primary order parameter are ongoing .",
    "in addition , the _ local _ toroidal moments associated with the atomic v sites in v@xmath4o@xmath5 and the atomic cu sites in cuo have been detected directly using resonant x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "such local toroidal moments could be of tremendous importance , as it has been proposed that they are candidates for the order parameter in the pseudo - gap phase of cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "the second - order term in the magnetic multipole expansion contains two additional contributions beyond the toroidal term , which describe in turn magnetic quadrupolar and magnetic monopolar components that couple respectively to the gradient and divergence of the magnetic field ( see detailed derivation below ) .",
    "while the latter has not been extensively discussed on the grounds that maxwell s equations tell us formally that @xmath6 does not diverge , it is in fact non - zero in materials with a _ diagonal _ linear magnetoelectric response . indeed",
    ", it could appropriately be described as a _ magnetoelectric monopole _ to distinguish it from the zeroth order term in the multipole expansion of the magnetic field which is the magnetic analogue to the electrical charge and indeed is formally zero .",
    "we emphasize also that the magnetoelectric monopole discussed here is a _ ground state property _ of the system , and so is distinct from those recently proposed and verified in spin ice , in which nonlocal magnetic monopoles exist as _ excited states _ @xcite .    the origin of the relationship between the monopolar contribution to the multipole expansion and the diagonal magnetoelectric response is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vortices ] ( a ) and ( b ) where we follow the discussion from ref .  .",
    "the monopolar magnetic vortex in panel ( a ) consists of local spin magnetic moments ( black solid arrows ) oriented outwards from a point ",
    "note that maxwell s equations are not violated ; while @xmath7 diverges , it is compensated for by @xmath8 and so @xmath6 does not diverge .",
    "since the spin moments @xmath9 are never parallel , it is known from the theory of multiferroics that there is a local radial electric polarization @xmath10 ( unfilled grey arrows ) associated with each pair of spins @xcite .",
    "however these local radial polarizations are uniform around the vortex and the net electric polarization is zero . on application of a magnetic field , however , the spin moments reorient to align themselves more closely parallel to the field ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the local contributions to the electric polarization no longer average to zero and a net polarization parallel to the magnetic field direction results .    for completeness",
    ", we show in figure  [ vortices ] ( c ) and ( d ) the analogous relationship between a toroidal vortex and the off - diagonal magnetoelectric response . in this case",
    "an applied magnetic field modifies the spin orientations so that a net magnetic moment is induced perpendicular to the direction of applied field .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we review the definition of the magnetoelectric monopole starting from a multipole expansion of the magnetic field and show that it couples to the divergence thereof . in section  [ calculation_and_measurement ]",
    "we describe how the monopole can be calculated from first - principles electronic structure methods , as well as how it could be directly measured experimentally .",
    "we introduce the term _ monopolization _ to describe the monopole per unit volume in periodic solids , and show that it is natural both theoretically and experimentally to divide the total monopolization into two contributions : that arising from the local monopoles around individual ions , and that arising from the global distribution of magnetic moments within the solid .",
    "we discuss also the problems associated with defining the monopolization for an infinite periodic solid , and propose a practical solution . in section  [ transition_metal_phosphates ] we present results of the calculated monopolizations for the family of lithium transition metal phosphates , limpo@xmath0 , m = mn , fe , co , ni . all members of this family have the same structure and overall magnetic order , but they differ in their local magnetic anisotropy and hence their magnetic symmetry . we find that the different magnetic symmetries lead to different monopolar orderings : in one case there is ferromonopolar ordering with a net macroscopic monopolization , and the remaining three cases have zero net monopolization , but with hidden `` anti - ferromonopolar '' orderings that have not previously been identified . in section  [ gltheory ]",
    "we develop the ginzburg - landau theory describing the coupling of the monopolization to homogeneous external magnetic and electric fields . in the final section",
    "we discuss the possible relevance of these concepts .",
    "following the derivation in ref .  , we consider a magnetization density @xmath11 , that may arise from both spin and orbital contributions , in an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath12 that varies slowly on the scale of the system size .",
    "then the interaction energy , @xmath13 , of the magnetization density with the magnetic field @xmath14 can be expanded in powers of field gradients calculated at some arbitrary reference point @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are cartesian directions .",
    "the first term is the interaction of the field with the magnetic moment of the system @xmath18 in the second term , the tensor @xmath19 with nine components can be decomposed into three parts ( summation over repeated indices is implied ) :    * the pseudoscalar from the trace of the tensor , @xmath20 + * the toroidal moment vector dual to the antisymmetric part of the tensor , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and + * the traceless symmetric tensor @xmath23 describing the quadrupole magnetic moment of the system , @xmath24 d^3{\\bm{r } } \\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the expansion of eqn .",

    "in this section we discuss the difficulties associated with the definition of the monopole in bulk , periodic solids , and propose solutions that allow a correspondence between calculated monopole moments and possible experimental measurements .",
    "first we note a simplification : since the orbital contribution to the magnetization density , @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the momentum , and @xmath31 is zero , the orbital contribution to the monopole is always formally zero , and only the spin contribution need be considered .    for systems of finite size , such as molecules or molecular clusters , that have zero net magnetic moment , the value of the monopole can be evaluated directly from the spin part of the magnetization density through the integral in eqn .",
    "[ eqn_monopole ] .",
    "[ eqn_monopole ] is not directly applicable to extended systems where periodic boundary conditions are employed , however , because the integral contains the position operator , @xmath32 .",

    "we see then that the monopole can be decomposed into two components : the first , comes from the local monopoles at the atomic sites , which arise from the same current distribution around the site that simultaneously gives rise to the local dipole moment .",

    "note that these atomic site monopoles can in principle be measured by resonant x - ray spectroscopy@xcite , which has been used successfully to detect an atomic site toroidal moment@xcite .",
    "no unambiguous measurement of atomic monopoles has been made to date , however , because a material has not yet been identified that meets the stringent conditions required to achieve an observation in the resonant x - ray measurement .",
    "we point out also that , provided that the local magnetic site is not an inversion center , the atomic monopoles can be non - zero even in a system with overall zero monopole moment ; we will explore some examples in section  [ transition_metal_phosphates ] .",
    "such systems might be described as `` anti - monopolar '' and should show a @xmath1-dependent magnetoelectric effect .",
    "the second contribution to the monopole , which we write @xmath59 for `` local moment '' , arises from representing the magnetization density by a distribution of localized magnetic moments @xmath38 at the atomic sites : @xmath60 in systems such as insulating @xmath61 transition metal oxides , which have large localized magnetic moments that are spatially separated by distances of a few  we expect this contribution to be the dominant contribution to the total monopole .        using eq .",

    "the total monopole resulting from these two contributions is then @xmath70 where the sum is over all the atomic sites .    in all the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ monopoles_cartoons ] , the net magnetization is zero .",
    "there exists a complication , however , in the case where the region over which the monpole is to be evaluated has a net magnetic dipole .",
    "the complication is that all multipoles in systems with non - zero lower - order multipoles ( the magnetic dipole in the case of the magnetoelectric monopole ) are dependent on the choice of origin used to evaluate them .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for systems with nonvanishing magnetic dipole moment , for a change of origin defined by @xmath71 the monopole changes as @xmath72 it remains an open question in general , which we do not address here , whether such origin dependence of the multipoles is physically meaningful ( see for example ref .  ) .",
    "one practical approach is to always choose as the origin the position of the average magnetic moment , @xmath73 , defined so that @xmath74 this is equivalent to neglecting any uncompensated part of the magnetization and retaining only the compensated part in the calculation of the monopole@xcite .",
    "care must be taken , however , in situations where a change in net magnetic dipole moment , or a structural rearrangement occurs , to ensure that a consistent choice of origin is maintained .",
    "next we turn to the case of a system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is often convenient to describe the properties of a bulk crystalline solid in terms of a small repeat unit  the unit cell  which is then replicated using periodic boundary conditions to generate the infinite solid .",
    "many intensive quantities such as the magnetization , which is defined to be the magnetic moment per unit volume , can then be simply obtained as the value of the quantity in a single unit cell divided by the unit cell volume . for the case of the macroscopic monopole per unit volume  which we propose to call the _ monopolization _ by analogy with magnetization , polarization , etc .",
    "[ eqn_monopole ] is not directly applicable to extended systems with periodic boundary conditions , because for a general continuous magnetization density @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eqn_monopole ] ) evaluated over one unit cell will lead to arbitrary values , depending on the particular choice of unit cell used in the calculation .",
    "we note that this behavior is distinct from the origin dependence discussed in section  [ decomposition ] , and persists even in the case when the net magnetization is zero .",
    "in fact the difficulties are exactly analogous to those encountered in defining a macroscopic bulk toroidization , and indeed reflect those involved in defining a macroscopic bulk ferroelectric polarization , which were solved through the introduction of the modern theory of polarization@xcite . a proposed solution in the case of the toroidization",
    "was described in detail in ref .  .",
    "in this section we extend the description to the case of the monopole and address the following questions :    1 .",
    "how should the monopole density  the monopolization  of a bulk periodic solid be formally defined ? 2 .   what are the consequences of the periodic boundary conditions within a bulk crystalline solid ?    for simplicity",
    "we develop the formalism for the case of the monopolization coming from the local moment contribution .",
    "first we note that , as we shall see later , the formalism requires that each local moment , @xmath38 , is equal to an integer number of bohr magnetons . since we consider only the spin part of the magnetic moment ( the orbital part does not contribute to the monopole ) , a magnetic moment that is an integer number of bohr magnetons corresponds to the moment of an integer number of electrons . in general",
    ", however , an integer number is not obtained from integrating the magnetization density over a sphere around an atomic site in a solid ; in fact this number is not uniquely defined as it depends on the choice of integration radius .",
    "rather , the spin moment of the corresponding spin - polarized wannier function should be used ; since a wannier function in an insulating system contains an integer number of electrons its spin is always an integer number of bohr magnetons .",
    "we then define the local moment monopolization , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the volume of the system with local moment monopole @xmath77 .",
    "then , for a large finite system containing @xmath78 identical unit cells each of volume @xmath79 : @xmath80 here , @xmath81 are the positions of the magnetic moments @xmath82 relative to the same ( arbitrary ) point within each unit cell , @xmath83 is a lattice vector with index @xmath84 , and we have used the fact that the orientation of the magnetic moments is the same in each unit cell .",
    "the summation over @xmath45 indicates the summation over all moments within a unit cell , and that over @xmath84 indicates the summation over all unit cells .",
    "expanding the scalar product , we obtain : @xmath85 using the fact that the sum over all lattice vectors contains both @xmath83 and @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the local moment monopole of a system of @xmath78 unit cells is just @xmath78 times the monopole evaluated for one unit cell , and the corresponding monopolizations are identical .    in an infinite periodic solid",
    ", we have a freedom in choosing the basis corresponding to the primitive unit cell of the crystal .",
    "in particular , we can translate any spin of the basis by a lattice vector @xmath83 without changing the overall periodic arrangement .",
    "however , such a translation of a spin by @xmath83 leads to a change in the local moment monopolization as follows : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a unit vector oriented in the direction of magnetic moment @xmath82 . the freedom in choosing the basis corresponding to the primitive unit cell thus leads to a multivaluedness of the monopolization with respect to certain `` increments '' ( defined by eq .",
    "(    [ quantum ] ) ) for each magnetic sub - lattice @xmath45 and lattice vector @xmath83 .",
    "this multivaluedness of the monopolization is reminiscent of the modern theory of electric polarization,@xcite where the polarization changes by @xmath90 when an elementary charge @xmath91 is translated by a lattice vector @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting multivaluedness has led to the concept of the `` polarization lattice '' corresponding to a bulk periodic solid,@xcite with @xmath90 called the `` polarization quantum '' if @xmath83 is one of the three primitive lattice vectors .",
    "an even closer analogy is provided by the toroidization , which is multivalued with values spaced by the toroidization increment @xmath92 , corresponding to translation of an elementary magnetic moment , @xmath93 by a lattice vector @xcite .",
    "( [ quantum ] ) suggests the existence of an analogous `` monopolization lattice '' , with monopolization increments @xmath94 , where @xmath83 is any primitive lattice vector and @xmath89 are the unit vectors indicating the orientations of the magnetic moments .",
    "note that the monopolization , and hence the monopolization increments are scalar quantities . as a result the corresponding monopolization lattice can become rather dense , particularly in cases where the three lattice vectors are unequal but close in size , and the spin moments are noncollinear and canted away from the lattice vector directions .",
    "we illustrate the behavior and implications of the monopolization lattice next with a simple model one - dimensional example .",

    "[ lattice]a .",
    "the moments , with magnitude @xmath95 , are spaced a distance @xmath42 apart from each other along the @xmath65 axis , and are alternating in orientation along @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the unit cell length is @xmath96 and there are two oppositely oriented magnetic moments in each unit cell .",
    "since this configuration does not possess a macroscopic magnetic dipole moment , the corresponding monopole moment is origin independent .    the arrangement of magnetic moments in fig .",
    "[ lattice]a is space - inversion symmetric with respect to each moment site and thus can not exhibit a macroscopic monopole moment .",
    "the local moment monopole of the single unit cell highlighted in fig .",

    "( [ a_local_moment ] ) , however , is identical to that calculated for the finite moment configuration in fig .  [ monopoles_cartoons]c , i.e. @xmath97 , and the corresponding monopolization , @xmath98 ( since the `` volume '' @xmath79 of the one - dimensional unit cell is just its length , @xmath96 ) . since the moments of magnitude @xmath99 are oriented exactly parallel to the @xmath65 axis , the elementary monopolization increment in this case is @xmath100 , which means that the monopolization of the unit cell is exactly equal to one half of the monopolization increment , and the allowed monopolization values for the periodic arrangement are @xmath101 , where @xmath84 can be any integer number .",
    "we see that in our example the allowed local moment monopolization values form a one - dimensional lattice of values , centrosymmetric around the origin .",
    "this is analogous to the cases of the electric polarization and the toroidization , where the polarization and toroidization lattices are invariant under all symmetry transformations of the underlying crystal structure . in particular , the polarization and toroidization lattices corresponding to centrosymmetric crystal structures are inversion symmetric , which is achieved in lattices that include either the zero or the half quantum / increment .",
    "we see that the same holds true for the local moment monopolization of our one - dimensional example , and that a centrosymmetric set of monopolization values can be understood as representing a non - monopolar state of the corresponding system .",
    "we also note that the formalism is only consistent for the case of local magnetic moments corresponding to integer numbers of bohr magnetons , which in turn correspond to the spin contribution from integer numbers of electrons .    in the case of the electric polarization ,",
    "it is now widely recognized that only differences in the polarization lattices between different configurations , such as between a centrosymmetric non - polar reference structure and a ferroelectric polar crystal , are in fact measurable quantities . since these differences are the same for each point of the polarization lattice they are well - defined quantities .",

    "we show that , in analogy with the cases of the toroidization and electric polarization , only differences in local moment monopolization , corresponding to two different bulk configurations , are measurable quantities and correspond to physical observables such as the difference in monopolization between a ferromonopolar state and its non - monopolar paraphase .",

    "as stated above , from a macroscopic symmetry point of view , the symmetries which allow for a macroscopic monopolization are identical with that allowing for a diagonal component of the linear magnetoelectric effect tensor . in this section ,",

    "this is the simplest possible free energy expression that can simultaneously describe ( i ) a phase transition from a para - monopolar ( @xmath201 ) into a ferromonopolar phase ( @xmath202 ) , ( ii ) the coupling of the electric polarization @xmath203 and the magnetization @xmath7 to the electric field @xmath204 and the magnetic field @xmath8 , respectively , and ( iii ) a coupling between the electric polarization , the magnetization , and the monopolization .",
    "note that only the magnetization and the polarization couple to @xmath8 and @xmath204 , the monopolization in general does not couple to any homogeneous external fields , in agreement with the fundamental definitions discussed in sec .  [ multipoleexpansion ] .",
    "the trilinear form of the coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ free - energy ] ) is the lowest possible order that is compatible with the overall space and time reversal symmetries . since our purpose here is to discuss the new features arising from this trilinear coupling , we leave for future work the analysis of gradient terms in the free energy that would be required to describe for example variations in monopolization , magnetization or polarization at domain walls .",
    "the equilibrium values for @xmath203 and @xmath7 can be obtained by minimizing eq .",
    "( [ free - energy ] ) .",
    "this leads to : @xmath205 and @xmath206 if one inserts eq .",

    "( [ pol ] ) one obtains ( to leading order in @xmath181 ) : @xmath207 the last term in eq .  (",
    "[ pme ] ) is a symmetric linear magnetoelectric effect proportional to the monopolization .",
    "thus , the presence of the trilinear coupling term between monopolization , magnetization , and polarization in eq .",
    "( [ free - energy ] ) gives rise to a diagonal magnetoelectric effect @xmath208 in the ferromonopolar phase , with @xmath209 ( note that an off - diagonal magnetoelectric effect is obtained from a trilinear coupling between toroidization , magnetization and polarization , as discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "conversely , the presence of a monopolar contribution can be inferred from the existence of a diagonal linear magnetoelectric response , the magnitude of which is determined by the product of the dielectric susceptibility , magnetic permeability , monopolization and the strength of the coupling between @xmath181 , @xmath203 and @xmath7 . if the linear magnetoelectric response is diagonal and isotropic , then there can be no quadrupolar contributions and the response arises entirely from monopolar contributions .",
    "we see also from eqn .",
    "[ pme ] that in the case of antiferromonopolar ordering , a homogeneous magnetic field will induce a finite-@xmath1 polarization .",
    "such a relationship could be used in the case of @xmath210 , to provide a more fundamental definition of an antiferroelectric in simultaneously antiferromonopolar systems , than the current unsatisfactory working definition based on the observation of double - loop hysteresis .",
    "finally we mention that an additional interesting consequence of the relationship between the monopolization and the diagonal magnetoelectric effect is the induction of monopoles by electric charge .",
    "this has been discussed previously in the context of axion electrodynamics@xcite , and is currently being revisited in the context of topological insulators@xcite .",
    "in summary we have presented a theoretical analysis of magnetoelectric monopoles in bulk periodic solids .",
    "we introduced the term `` monopolization '' to describe the monopole moment per unit volume , and considered two contributions , one arising from the local variation in magnetization density around the atom and the second from the distribution of localized magnetic dipole moments throughout the unit cell .",
    "we found that the latter dominates the total monopolization in transition metal compounds with ferromonopolar ordering .",
    "we showed that , for ferromonopolar materials , periodic boundary conditions lead to a multivaluedness of the monopolization , suggesting that only differences in monopolization are well - defined observable macroscopic quantities .",
    "we found also that care must be taken in evaluating such monopolization differences : for example in the example of the distorted one - dimensional antiferromagnetic chain discussed in sec.[chain ] , the change in monopolization due to a structural distortion can be calculated straightforwardly , whereas in the case of a magnetic moment reversal one has to subtract the improper monopolization change that is caused by the corresponding change in the monopolization increment .",
    "quantitative measurements of monopolizations are challenging .",
    "the atomic site monopolization can in principle be detected using resonant x - ray scattering , although the experimental constraints are rather rigorous and a suitable material for such an experiment has not yet been identified .",
    "in particular , for most space group symmetries the sites that allow an atomic site monopole also allow an atomic site quadrupolar component , and disentangling the two contributions is not straightforward @xcite .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by selecting materials with an isotropic diagonal magnetoelectric response @xcite , however few such materials have been identified to date .",
    "even more problematic is the question of how to measure the macroscopic local moment monopolization . according to the fundamental definition of the monopole moment ,",
    "this is in principle possible by measuring the effect on a sample of a diverging magnetic field , however such a field is not accessible .",
    "it is possible that earlier observations of a quadrupolar magnetic field around a spherical sample of the prototypical diagonal magnetoelectric cr@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite also incorporate a monopolar contribution ; the theory underlying these measurements will be revisited in future work @xcite .",
    "it has also been recently proposed that signatures of monopolar behavior will manifest in the transport properties of diagonal magnetoelectrics @xcite    an open question , both for ferrotoroidic and ferromonopolar materials is whether the toroidal moment or monopole moment respectively can be a primary order parameter , or is always secondary to an antiferromagnetic or structural ordering .",
    "currently no case has been identified even theoretically in which the monopolization is non - zero while there is no magnetic ordering , although it is possible that some `` hidden - order parameter '' materials that are of current interest might prove to fall into this class @xcite .",
    "the fact that the monopole order parameter is a scalar might be helpful in distinguishing responses that arise from the antiferromagnetism from those of the monopole , in cases where the antiferromagnetic order parameter is a vector . within the class of secondary ferromonopolar materials ,",
    "it is also an open question whether there is a fundamental difference between the case in which the primary order parameter is the afm ordering , and that where it is a structural phase transition from a centrosymmetric antiferromagnet ( which does not allow monopolization ) to a non - centrosymmetric monopolar state .",
    "finally , we mention that it has been argued that ferrotoroidicity is a key concept for fitting all forms of ferroic order in a simple fundamental scheme based on the different transformation properties of the corresponding order parameters with respect to time and space inversion ( see refs .  , in particular fig .  2 in ref .",
    "it is clear that from a symmetry point of view , that the monopolization could play a similar role , since a ferromonopolar material also breaks both space - inversion and time - reversal symmetry . as a result the nonlinear optical techniques used in ref .   to identify ferrotoroidic ordering are sensitive also to the monopolar symmetry breaking , and",
    "could provide indirect evidence for the presence of monopolization .",
    "in addition , the four fundamental forms of ferroic order , with order parameters transforming according to the four different representations of the `` parity group '' generated by the two operations of time and space reversal@xcite could be chosen to be ferroelasticity , ferroelectricity , ferromagnetism , and ferromonopolicity ( rather than ferrotoroidicity ) .",
    "whether the scalar nature of the monopole , compared with the vector nature of the toroidal moment , makes this choice more or less appropriate is an open question .",
