    "it is well known that only a few quantum mechanical models admit exact solutions .",
    "the class of exactly solvable models can , however , be enlarged by using the technique of generating isospectral hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "recently , another class of problems @xcite consisting of so - called conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) problems has emerged .",
    "the characteristic feature of this class is that their members are exactly solvable problems when the parameters appearing in the potential are fine tuned to assume some specific numerical value or to lie in some range of values .    in some recent papers @xcite several classes of ces problems ,",
    "whose construction is based on supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite have been found .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the classes associated with the linear and radial harmonic oscillator admit some non - linear algebra as their symmetry algebra .",
    "here our objective is to construct coherent states corresponding to these ces problems and examine some of their properties .",
    "we recall that usually coherent states are constructed using as a basis some lie algebra @xcite . in contrast , here the coherent states are constructed over non - linear algebras and we call them _ non - linear coherent states_. in this paper we limit ourselves to the class of ces potentials associated with the radial harmonic oscillator . to be more precise",
    ", we shall start with systems having @xmath0 dynamical symmetry and then construct coherent states corresponding to the isospectral partners which have a non - linear ( i.e.  deformed ) @xmath0 symmetry . in this context",
    "we recall that in ref @xcite nieto et al described a method of constructing coherent and squeezed states for arbitrary quantum mechanical potentials . in the present paper",
    "we construct coherent states for hitherto unknown potentials having some particular symmetry properties . to be a bit more explicit , we consider two cases .",
    "one in which susy is broken and the other in which susy is unbroken . in the former case non - linear coherent states can be constructed over the entire fock space .",
    "whereas in the latter case non - linear coherent states are defined in a subspace of the fock space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the essentials of susy quantum mechanics . in section 3",
    "we discuss the ces potentials associated with the radial harmonic oscillator model and its non - linear symmetry algebra .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the construction of the non - linear coherent states .",
    "basic properties of these states are also discussed .",
    "finally , in section 5 we briefly discuss the case of unbroken susy and in section 6 some discussion and outlook is given .",
    "to begin with we note that witten s model of supersymmetric quantum mechanics consists of a pair of hamiltonians @xcite @xmath1 acting on some suitable hilbert space @xmath2 . for the purpose at hand",
    "we take the linear space of square integrable functions on the positive half - line with dirichlet boundary condition at the origin , @xmath3 .",
    "the supersymmetric partner potentials in ( 1 ) are given by @xmath4\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the susy potential and @xmath6 . in terms of the operators @xmath7 the hamiltonians in ( 1 ) read @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "let us denote the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath10 by @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 then it can be shown @xcite that in the case of broken susy ( we will mainly concentrate on this case ) the spectrum of @xmath14 coincides with that of @xmath15 and both are strictly positive : @xmath16 thus it is clear that if one of the hamiltonians is exactly solvable then the spectral properties of the other one are also known , that is , it becomes exactly solvable , too .",
    "this is the basic idea in the supersymmetric construction methods of ces potentials . to be a bit more explicit , in @xcite",
    "it has been suggested to construct susy potentials @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath17 becomes ( under certain conditions imposed on the parameters involved ) one of the well - known exactly solvable ( shape - invariant ) potentials and thus giving rise , in general , to a class of ces potentials @xmath18 .",
    "now as a specific model we consider the following susy potential @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a confluent hypergeometric function and the two potential parameters have to obey the conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 . this susy potential can be shown @xcite to give rise to @xmath23 clearly , @xmath24 represents the generalised radial harmonic oscillator ( this can be regarded as the potential corresponding to the two body calogero - sutherland model ) and the associated spectral properties of @xmath25 are well known @xmath26^{1/2 } x^{\\gamma + 1}\\,\\rme^{- x^2 / 2}\\,l_{n}^{\\gamma + \\frac{1}{2 } } ( x^2)\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath27 denotes a generalised laguerre polynomial and we also note that susy is broken , that is , @xmath28 . as a consequence , the susy partner hamiltonian @xmath29 has the same eigenvalues @xmath30 and its eigenfunctions can be obtained from ( 8) via ( 5 ) : @xmath31 & \\hspace{-8mm}=\\displaystyle\\left[\\frac{2\\,n ! } { ( n+\\gamma+1+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2})\\gamma(n+\\gamma+\\frac{3}{2})}\\right]^{1/2 } x^{\\gamma+2}\\,\\rme^{-x^2/2 } \\left(l_n^{\\gamma+3/2}(x^2)+\\frac{u'(x)}{2\\,x\\,u(x)}\\right)\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the corresponding ces potential explicitly reads @xmath32    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the symmetry algebra underlying the eigenvalue problem associated with @xmath29 is a non - linear one . to be more explicit , with the help of the ladder operators for @xmath25 given by @xmath33 , which together with its adjoint @xmath34 and @xmath25 close a ( linear ) lie algebra , one can introduce similar ladder operators for @xmath29 defined by @xmath35 and its adjoint @xmath36 .",
    "these operators act on eigenstates of @xmath29 as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 from these relations it also follows that @xmath40 & = \\textstyle ( -\\frac{1}{4})^n\\left[n!\\,(\\gamma + \\frac{3}{2})_n ( \\gamma + 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2})_n ( \\gamma + 2 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2})_n   \\right]^{-1/2 } ( d^{\\dagger})^n \\psi^{-}_{0 } ( x)\\;. \\end{array}\\ ] ] the non - linear algebra closed by the operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath14 explicitly reads @xmath43=-2d \\;,\\quad   \\left[h_{-},d^{\\dagger}\\right]= 2d^{\\dagger}\\;,\\quad   \\left[d , d^{\\dagger}\\right]= \\phi ( h_{-})\\;,\\ ] ] where the non - linear structure function @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 actually , these types of algebras ( having as structure function a polynomial of degree @xmath46 in one of the generators ) are called @xmath47 algebras . more explicitly , the above algebra ( 14 )",
    "is a polynomial deformed @xmath0 algebra and has first been discussed in some detail by rocek @xcite . for a discussion within a more general approach see also karassiov @xcite and katriel and quesne @xcite .",
    "the quadratic casimir operator for the non - linear ( cubic ) algebra ( 14 ) reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 we note that in the above fock space representation ( 11)-(13 ) we have the relations @xmath50",
    "dd^\\dagger = \\psi ( h_{-})\\;,\\quad d^\\dagger d= \\psi ( h_{-}-2)\\ ; ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] and , therefore , the casimir operator ( 16 ) vanishes as expected @xcite .",
    "this , however , will in general not be the case for non - fock space representations of the algebra ( 14 ) @xcite .",
    "we shall now construct coherent states corresponding to the algebra in ( 14 ) . at this point",
    "we note that coherent states can be constructed following any of the three methods @xcite : ( i ) by applying the unitary displacement operator to the ground state .",
    "( ii ) defining coherent states as eigenstate of the lowering operator . (",
    "iii ) defining coherent states as minimum uncertainty states .",
    "these three methods are generally not equivalent and only in the case of the standard harmonic oscillator , where the commutator of the raising and lowering operator is the unit operator , these three methods are equivalent . since the symmetry algebra in the present case is a non - linear one , the baker - campbell - hausdorff disentangling theorem can not be used and so we shall follow the second approach to construct non - linear coherent states . note that coherent states obtained in this way are essentially barut - girardello coherent states @xcite .",
    "we also remark that the procedure following below is very similar to the construction of coherent states associated with quantum groups @xcite .",
    "thus we define coherent states as @xmath51 where the @xmath52 s are real constants to be determined , @xmath53 is an arbitrary complex number , and the ket @xmath54 is a short - hand notation for the eigenstate @xmath55 of @xmath29 . now , by our definition @xmath56",
    "should be an eigenstate of the lowering operator @xmath41 and so we have @xmath57 comparing this result with definition ( 19 ) we obtain the recurrence relation @xmath58 and consequently the constants @xmath52 for @xmath59 are given by @xmath60 the remaining constant @xmath61 is determined via the normalisation of the coherent states : @xmath62\\\\[4 mm ] & \\displaystyle =   c^{2}_{0}\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0 } \\frac{(|\\mu|^2/16)^n}{n!\\ , ( \\gamma + \\frac{3}{2})_n(\\gamma + 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2})_n   ( \\gamma + 2 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2})_n}= 1\\;.    \\end{array}\\ ] ] hence , the normalisation constant @xmath63 can be expressed in terms of a generalised hypergeometric function @xmath64 similarly we can show that these non - linear coherent states are not orthogonal for @xmath65 , @xmath66 and , therefore , form an over - complete basis in the hilbert space .",
    "another important property , namely , the resolutions of unity can also be obtained for these non - linear coherent states .",
    "let us assume that we have a positive measure @xmath67 on the complex plane such that @xmath68 making the polar decomposition @xmath69 and the ansatz @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being a yet unknown density on the positive half - line , the above resolution of unity ( 26 ) reduces to the relations @xmath72 in other words , @xmath71 is a probability density on the positive half - line defined via the moments given above . for technical details on this so - called stieltjes moment problem",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we note that the integral ( [ moments ] ) may be viewed as mellin transformation @xcite of the density @xmath71 . in other words",
    ", @xmath71 is given via the inverse mellin transformation of its moments .",
    "for the above moments this inverse transformation leads ( see ref @xcite p 353 ) to a meijer g - function @xcite and we explicitly have @xmath73 in figure 1 we plot the radial density @xmath74 for fixed @xmath75 and various values of @xmath76 .",
    "figure 2 presents the same quantity now , however , with fixed @xmath77 and various values of @xmath78 .",
    "we now proceed to examine some further properties of these non - linear coherent states . to do this we define the following hermitian operators : @xmath79 in terms of these operators the non - linear algebra ( 14 ) reads @xmath80 = - 2\\rmi x_2 \\;,\\quad   \\left [ h_- , x_2 \\right ] = 2\\rmi x_1 \\;,\\quad \\left [ x_1 , x_2 \\right ] = \\frac{\\rmi}{2}\\ , \\phi ( h_- ) \\;. \\label{29}\\ ] ] the uncertainty relation for the two operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 in some state @xmath83 reads @xmath84|\\psi\\rangle\\,\\right|^2\\ ; , \\label{30}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the non - linear coherent states @xmath56 in ( [ 19 ] ) having property ( [ 20 ] ) always satisfy the equality sign in ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "note that in the notation used in @xcite these states are called intelligent states .",
    "however , it can be shown that when the functional @xmath86 attains its minimum for some value of @xmath53 , say @xmath87 , then the non - linear coherent state @xmath88 is a minimum uncertainty state corresponding to the non - linear algebra ( [ 29 ] ) .",
    "let us now briefly describe the situation when susy is unbroken . in this case",
    "we choose @xmath89 where now @xmath90 . for a more general case and the conditions on the parameters",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 see ref @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath17 again represents the radial oscillator while @xmath18 is a ces potential .",
    "note that essential details of this problem can be obtained from the broken susy case by replacing @xmath92 by @xmath93 .",
    "however , the eigenvalues for @xmath29 are now given by @xmath94 which coincides with the spectrum of @xmath25 with the exception of the vanishing ground - state energy , which is missing in @xmath25 due to unbroken susy .",
    "for the explicit form of the corresponding eigenstates we refer to @xcite .",
    "again we may define ladder operators @xmath95 and @xmath96 where the susy operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 are now defined with the new susy potential ( [ neww ] ) .",
    "they act on the eigenstates of @xmath29 in the following way : @xmath99 where @xmath100 from the last relation in ( [ d ] ) it is clear that the ground state is isolated in the sense that the non - linear algebra is ( non - trivially ) realised over the excited states only .",
    "note that the non - linear algebra closed by @xmath41 , @xmath101 and @xmath29 is identical in form with ( 14 ) .",
    "however , in the structure function ( 15 ) we have to replace @xmath92 by @xmath102 @xcite .    now proceeding as in the case of broken susy",
    ", we can find a superposition state which is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath41 .",
    "however , this non - linear coherent state is now given by a superposition of the excited energy eigenstates : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a complex number and the @xmath105 s are given by @xmath106 we note that the states @xmath107 in ( [ eta ] ) are very similar to coherent states although they are not coherent states . in particular , the states @xmath107 are not complete because of the absence of the ground state in the superposition ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "we can , however , call these states excited coherent states or photon - added coherent states @xcite because @xmath108 for all @xmath109 . note that @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding resolution of unity reads in this case @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and the probability density @xmath71 is again given via its moments : @xmath114 as in the case of broken susy @xmath71 can be expressed in terms of a meijer g - function and explicitly reads @xmath115",
    "starting from the cubic algebra formed by the ladder operators of ces hamiltonians related to the radial harmonic oscillator we have constructed the associated non - linear coherent states .",
    "these states are different to those obtained recently @xcite via the darboux transformation from standard ( linear ) coherent states @xcite .",
    "the present non - linear coherent states have been shown to be minimum uncertainty states with respect to the @xmath81-@xmath82 uncertainty relation .    in the present approach",
    "we have constructed non - linear coherent states as eigenstates of the annihilation operator ( method ( ii ) ) , which turn out to be equivalent to those defined as minimum uncertainty states ( method ( iii ) ) .",
    "it would also be of interest to find similar states which equalise other uncertainties like @xmath29-@xmath81 or @xmath29-@xmath82 , and find their relations to the present one .",
    "another interesting possibility is to construct in a similar way coherent states related to other ces potentials . for example , those related to the ces potentials which are susy partners of the linear harmonic oscillator . here",
    "the algebra formed by the ladder operators closes a quadratic algebra and susy is unbroken @xcite .",
    "in fact , in doing so @xcite one finds other non - linear coherent states which generalise those previously constructed by fernndez et al @xcite .",
