    "a fundamental feature of nuclear structure is the basic symmetry between neutrons and protons , namely , the _ charge independence _ of the nuclear force , that is evident in the striking similarity in the energy spectra of nuclear isobars @xcite .",
    "this implies that the proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) interaction and the neutron - neutron ( @xmath5 ) interaction are equal to the isospin @xmath6 @xmath1 interaction and leads to ` rotational ' invariance in isotopic space .",
    "however , the isospin invariance is violated by the electromagnetic interaction , mainly the coulomb repulsion between nucleons , which has become the focus of many phenomenological and microscopic studies @xcite .",
    "the primary effect of the coulomb force is to introduce into the theory a dependence on the third isospin projection , @xmath7 , resulting in energy splitting of isobaric analog states ( a @xmath8-multiplet ) without coupling different isospin multiplets . at the same time",
    ", the isospin - violating part of the coulomb interaction leads to small isospin mixing in nuclear ground states increasing with @xmath9 and largest for @xmath10 .",
    "the ground state isospin impurity is theoretically estimated to be as small as a percent for nuclei in the @xmath11 level @xcite , and up to @xmath12 toward the @xmath13 shell closure @xcite .",
    "another source of mixing probability is the isospin non - conserving part of the nuclear hamiltonian , which includes effects due to the proton - neutron mass difference and small charge dependent components in the strong nucleonic interaction @xcite .",
    "experimental results clearly reveal the existence of isospin mixing @xcite .",
    "the increase in isospin mixing towards medium mass nuclei has been detected in novel high - precision experiments @xcite , which continue to push the exploration of unstable nuclei with the advent of advanced radioactive beam facilities .",
    "the violation of the charge independence of the nuclear interaction is well established .",
    "the purely nuclear parts of the @xmath4 force and the @xmath14 @xmath1 force differ from each other , which appears to be associated with the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath15 scattering in the @xmath1 system and the low - energy @xmath4 scattering lead to the estimate that the nuclear interaction between protons and neutrons ( @xmath16 ) in @xmath6 states are more attractive than the force between the protons ( @xmath17 ) by @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the charge asymmetry between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions was found to be smaller ; namely , less than @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "more recent investigations confirm isospin violation in light nuclei @xcite starting with modern charge dependent realistic interactions @xcite and including valuable input information from particle physics ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , after the coulomb energy is taken into account the discrepancy in the isobaric - multiplet energies is bigger for the seniority zero levels as compared to higher - seniority states indicating the presence of a short range charge dependent interaction @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath21 pairing correlations have been recently shown to have an overwhelming dominance in the isotensor energy difference within isobaric multiplets @xcite , which manifests itself in the charge dependent @xmath22 nature of the pairing interaction .",
    "the findings mentioned above point out the need for a charge dependent microscopic description of @xmath21 pairing correlations . an algebraic @xmath0 approach is ideally suited for this purpose @xcite for it combines , on the one hand a microscopic modeling of the pairing interaction and its charge dependence , and on the other hand , a straightforward scheme for estimating the significance of the isospin mixing due to pairing correlations without the need for carrying out large - dimensional matrix diagonalizations .",
    "strong isospin breaking in pair formation , if found , implies a significant presence of isospin admixture among the seniority - zero isobaric analog @xmath2 states  including @xmath2 ground states .",
    "this in turn will affect the predictive power of precise studies of superallowed @xmath23 fermi @xmath3-decay transitions .",
    "this is because the latter provide reliable tests of isospin mixing ( see @xcite for a review ) , and as well furnish a precise test of the unitary condition of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite ( for a review of this subject , see @xcite ) .",
    "our objective is to explore isospin mixing beyond that due to the coulomb interaction , which is isolated with the help of an advanced coulomb correction formula @xcite .",
    "specifically , we focus on the isospin non - conserving part of the _ pure _ nuclear interaction , which recently has been found to be at least as important as the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this study shows the significance of the pairing charge dependence and its role in mixing isospin multiplets of pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath2 states .",
    "we employ a simple but powerful group - theoretical model , which is based on the @xmath0 algebra ( isomorphic to @xmath24 @xcite ) . the @xmath25 microscopic model is precisely suitable for the qualitative study of isospin violation in isobaric analog @xmath2 states   because it naturally extends the isospin invariant nuclear interaction to incorporate isospin non - conserving forces , while it retains the @xmath25 dynamical symmetry of the hamiltonian ( see @xcite for a review on dynamical symmetries ) .",
    "a comparison with experimental data demonstrates that the @xmath25 model provides a reasonable description of the pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath2 states  ) odd - odd nuclei , as well as , for example , low - lying @xmath2 states in odd - odd nuclei that have the same isospin as the ground state of a semi - magic even - even isobaric neighbor with fully - paired protons ( or neutrons ) . ] in light and medium mass nuclei , where protons and neutrons occupy the same shell @xcite .",
    "the two - body model interaction includes proton - neutron and like - particle pairing plus symmetry terms and contains a non - negligible implicit portion of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath25 model interaction itself , which relates to the whole energy spectrum rather than to a single @xmath26 @xmath27 state , was found to be quite strongly correlated ( @xmath28 ) with the realistic cd - bonn+3terms interaction @xcite in the @xmath27 channel and with an overall correlation of @xmath29 with the realistic gxpf1 interaction @xcite for the @xmath11 orbit @xcite . in short , the relatively simple @xmath25 model seems to be a reasonable approximation that reproduces especially that part of the interaction that is responsible for shaping pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath2 states .",
    "the @xmath25 model reflects the symplectic dynamical symmetry of isobaric analog @xmath2 states   @xcite determined by the strong nuclear interaction .",
    "the weaker coulomb interaction breaks this symmetry and significantly complicates the nuclear pairing problem .",
    "this is why , in our investigation we adopt a sophisticated phenomenological coulomb correction to the experimental energies such that a nuclear system can be regarded as if there is no coulomb interaction between its constituents .",
    "coulomb corrected _ experimental energy , @xmath30 , for given valence protons @xmath31 and neutrons @xmath32 is adjusted to be @xmath33 where ) the energies are assumed positive for bound states ; @xmath34 is also defined positive .",
    "] @xmath35 is the total measured energy including the coulomb energy , @xmath36 is the binding energy of the core , and @xmath37 is the coulomb correction for a nucleus with mass @xmath38 and @xmath9 protons taken relative to the core @xmath39 .",
    "the recursion formula for the @xmath40 coulomb energy is derived in @xcite with the use of the pape and antony formula @xcite .",
    "the coulomb corrected energies ( [ eexpcoul ] ) should reflect solely the nuclear properties of the many - nucleon systems .",
    "assuming charge independence of the nuclear force , the general isoscalar hamiltonian with sp(4 ) dynamical symmetry , which consists of one- and two - body terms and conserves the number of particles , can be expressed through the sp(4 ) group generators , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the shell dimension for a given nucleon type .",
    "the generators @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the valence isospin operators , @xmath46 create ( annihilate ) respectively a proton - neutron ( @xmath1 ) pair , a proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) pair or a neutron - neutron @xmath47 pair of total angular momentum @xmath48 and isospin @xmath27 , and @xmath49 is the total number of valence particles with an eigenvalue @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 are interaction strength parameters and @xmath53 is the fermi level energy ( see table i in @xcite for estimates ) .",
    "the isospin conserving hamiltonian ( [ clh0 ] ) includes an isovector ( @xmath27 ) pairing interaction ( @xmath54 for attraction ) and a diagonal isoscalar ( @xmath55 ) force , which is related to a symmetry term ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "charge dependent but charge symmetric nucleon - nucleon interaction ( @xmath57 ) brings into the nuclear hamiltonian a small isotensor component ( with zero third isospin projection so that the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is achieved in the framework of the @xmath25 model by introducing the two additional terms , @xmath59 to the isospin invariant model hamiltonian ( [ clh0 ] ) in a way that the hamiltonian @xmath60 possesses @xmath25 dynamical symmetry . in other words ,",
    "charge dependence is introduced into the model pairing hamiltonian ( [ clh0 ] ) by allowing the strength of two of the underlying interactions to vary .",
    "the interaction strength parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( [ hinc ] ) determined in an optimum fit over a significant number of nuclei ( total of 149 ) @xcite are given in table [ tab : fitstat ] and yield non - zero values .",
    "these parameters yield quantitative results that are superior than the ones with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; for example , in the case of the @xmath11 level the variance between the model and experimental energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath2 states   increases by @xmath65 when the @xmath62 and @xmath61 interactions are turned off . for the present investigation the parameters in ( [ clh0 ] ) along with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( [ hinc ] )",
    "are not varied as their values were fixed to be physically valid and to yield reasonable energy @xcite and fine structure @xcite reproduction for light and medium mass nuclei with valence protons and neutrons occupying the same shell .",
    "for these nuclei in the mass range @xmath66 , the pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath2 states  are well described , but still approximately , by the eigenvectors of the effective hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) in a basis of fully - paired @xmath2 states @xcite .    [",
    "tab : fitstat ]    while the second interaction ( @xmath67 ) in ( [ hinc ] ) takes into account only the splitting of the isobaric analog energies , the first correction induces small isospin mixing ( i m ) .",
    "the isospin mixing interaction ( [ hinc ] ) does not account for the entire interaction that mixes states of same angular momentum and parity but different isospin values .",
    "it only describes a possible @xmath68 mixing between isobaric analog @xmath2 states  due to a pure nuclear pairing interaction .",
    "while the extent of such isospin admixing is expected to be smaller than the total mixing due to isospin non - conserving terms @xcite , it may influence precise model calculations depending on the importance of the charge dependence in pairing correlations .",
    "the estimate for the model parameters ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) can determine the extent to which the isospin symmetry is broken while @xmath8 remains a good quantum number .",
    "breaking of the isospin invariance @xmath69 ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) is in general negligible for light nuclei ( @xmath70 and @xmath11 levels ) in agreement with the experimental data . for medium mass nuclei in the @xmath71 major shell",
    "the isospin breaking is significantly greater .",
    "furthermore , as expected from observations , for the @xmath70 level the interaction strengths of all @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 pairing are almost equal ( @xmath8 is a good quantum number ) , @xmath72 ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) , and they differ for the @xmath11 and for the @xmath71 shells , with the @xmath1 isovector strength being more attractive , @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath61 isospin mixing interaction strength is extremely small and hence a charge independent nuclear interaction ( where @xmath61 is neglected ) comprises a quite reasonable approximation .",
    "the latter yields major simplifications to the pairing problem and consequently most of isovector pairing studies have been done assuming good isospin .",
    "the question regarding how strong individual isospin non - conserving nuclear interactions are [ such as ( [ hinc ] ) ] still remains open  there are no sharp answers at the present level of experimental results and microscopic theoretical interpretations .",
    "it is only their overall contribution that is revealed by the free nucleon - nucleon data @xcite to be slightly ( by @xmath18 ) more attractive in the @xmath1 @xmath6 system than the @xmath4 one . within the framework of the @xmath25 model",
    ", the charge dependence of the pure nuclear interaction can be estimated through the comparison of the @xmath74 two - body model interaction [ ( [ clh ] ) with @xmath75 relative to the @xmath76 in the @xmath77 multiplets , which , for example in the @xmath11 level , is on average @xmath78 .",
    "this estimation does not aim to confirm the charge - dependence , which is very difficult at this level of accuracy compared to the broad energy range considered in the model for nuclei with masses @xmath79 .",
    "nonetheless , it reflects the fingerprints of the experimental data in the properties of the model interaction ( [ clh ] ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath25 model reproduces reasonably well the @xmath80-coefficient in the well - known isobaric multiplet mass equation @xcite @xmath81 for the binding energies of isobaric analogs ( of the same mass number @xmath38 , isospin @xmath8 , angular momentum @xmath82 , etc . ) , where the coefficient @xmath80 ( @xmath83 ) depends on the isotensor ( isovector ) component of the nuclear interaction [ i.e. , of rank 2 ( 1 ) with respect to isospin ` rotations ' ] .",
    "the @xmath80-coefficient is indeed an energy filter , @xmath84 , for a given mass number @xmath38 and isospin @xmath8 . in the framework of our model",
    ", this energy function for the lowest isobaric analog @xmath2 states   was found to be in a good agreement with observed fine - structure effects ( where data was available ) @xcite and it reproduces the experimental staggering behavior with respect to @xmath38 ( figure [ stg2ic ] ) .",
    "both theoretical and experimental results show that this finite energy difference when centered at an @xmath10 odd - odd nucleus ( @xmath74 and @xmath85 odd ) , and hence @xmath80 , is negative and very close to zero for @xmath27 multiplets in the @xmath11 shell ( see figure [ stg2ic ] for @xmath85 odd ) .",
    "such an agreement of the @xmath25 model outcome with experimental evidence is a valuable result .",
    "the requirement that the coefficients of ( [ imme ] ) are well reproduced is essential for the isospin non - conserving models @xcite , which has been achieved in @xcite by increasing ( approximately by @xmath86 ) of all the @xmath27 @xmath1 matrix elements relative to the @xmath5 ones and which has lead to a conclusion in @xcite that the isotensor nature of the nuclear interaction is dominated by a @xmath21 pairing term .",
    "= 3.0 in    in short , the freedom allowed by introducing additional parameters ( as @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) reflects the symmetries observed in light nuclei ( good isospin ) and the comparatively larger symmetry - breaking as expected in medium - mass nuclei .",
    "hence , the charge dependence of the nuclear force , being a very challenging problem , yields results , based on a simple group - theoretical approach , that are qualitatively consistent with the observations .      both empirical evidence ( such as scattering analysis and finite energy differences ) and the comparison of the model to experimental data ( table [ tab : fitstat ] ) does not yield equal pairing strengths ( @xmath87 ) resulting in a coupling of isospin eigenstates @xmath88 from different isospin multiplets with a degree of mixing expected to be very small .",
    "therefore , the eigenvectors of the total hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) , @xmath89 , have an almost good isospin @xmath90 quantum number .",
    "their overlap with the states of definite isospin values yields an estimate for the magnitude of the isospin admixture ( see table [ tab : isomix ] for the @xmath70 and @xmath11 orbits ) : @xmath91 . \\label{delta}\\ ] ]    [ tab : isomix ]    the overlap percentages in table [ tab : isomix ] confirm that the nuclear lowest isobaric analog @xmath2 states   have primarily isospin @xmath92 for even - even , and @xmath93 for odd - odd nuclei , with a very small mixture of the higher possible isospin values . as it is expected , the @xmath94 isospin mixing increases as @xmath9 and @xmath95 approach one another and towards the middle of the shell .",
    "for nuclei occupying a single-@xmath96 shell , the mixing of the isospin states is less than @xmath97 .",
    "although the isospin mixing is negligible for light nuclei in the @xmath98 orbit , it is clearly bigger for the @xmath99 level .",

    "@xmath115 , which in the framework of our model is given as @xmath116 of the superallowed @xmath117 analog @xmath118 transition , @xmath119 . for more than two - state mixing",
    ", the degree of isospin admixture between isobaric analog @xmath2 states   should be estimated using the normalized transition matrix element between non - analog ( na ) states ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath120 where @xmath117 is the almost good isospin of the parent nucleus ( see table [ tab : beta ] for @xmath11 ) . in general , the @xmath121 correction may be very different than the order of the @xmath122 overlap quantity ( [ delta ] ) presented in table [ tab : isomix ] because in decays the degrees of isospin mixing between non - analog states within both the parent and daughter nuclei are significant .",
    "[ tab : beta ]    the analysis of the results shows that the mixing between isobaric analog @xmath2 states   ( which is at least @xmath123 mixing ) is on average @xmath124 excluding even - even @xmath10 nuclei .",
    "this is on the order of a magnitude less than the mixing of the first excited @xmath2 non - analog state due to isospin non - conserving interaction , which is typically about @xmath125 for the @xmath11 level @xcite .",
    "in addition , this yields nonanalog @xmath101-decays weaker than possible gamow - teller transitions ; the strength of the latter is found to be less than @xmath126 of the total @xmath101-decay strenght for the nuclei in the @xmath11 shell @xcite and to substantially increase with increasing mass number @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this makes @xmath121 mixing very difficult to be detected especially when the isospin - symmetry breaking correction ( @xmath127 ) to analog fermi matrix elements in this level is on the order of a percent @xcite .",
    "not surprising , the largest values for the @xmath128 correction are observed for @xmath68 @xmath129-decays to energetically accessible @xmath2 ground states of even - even @xmath10 nuclei ( table [ tab : beta ] ) . while for these decays @xmath130 is extremely small , namely less than @xmath131 , as expected for the contribution of the higher - lying @xmath2 states @xcite , it is comparable to the order of isospin - symmetry breaking corrections for the @xmath11 orbit that are typically taken into account @xcite .",
    "the reason may be that for the even - even @xmath10 nuclei the second - lying isobaric analog @xmath2 states   are situated relatively low due to a significant @xmath1 interaction ( figure [ cabetadecays ] ) .",
    "= 3.4 in    above all , the @xmath128 results in table [ tab : beta ] clearly show the overall pattern and the order of significance of the isospin mixing under consideration .",
    "this is evident within the first - order approximation in terms of the @xmath61 parameter ( @xmath132 ) of @xmath128 , which for @xmath11 deviates on average by only 2% from its exact calculations in table [ tab : beta ] .",
    "the @xmath128 isospin mixing correction is then proportional to @xmath133 and one finds out that its order of magnitude remains the same for large variations of the @xmath61 parameter of more than 60% .",
    "in addition , greater @xmath61 values are not very likely because the @xmath134 estimates ( table [ tab : beta ] ) fall close below an upper limit , which does not contradict experimental and theoretical results for other types of isospin mixing .",
    "moreover , in this first - order approximation the ratio of any two isospin corrections for @xmath11 is independent of the parameters of the model interaction .",
    "this implies that such a ratio does not reflect at all the uncertainties of the interaction strength parameters but rather it is characteristic of the relative strength of both decays .",
    "it identifies the decay , for which the maximum isospin mixing correction is expected in the @xmath11 orbit , namely @xmath135 , and as well as the amount by which @xmath128 of the other possible non - analog decays is relatively suppressed .",
    "for example , the @xmath128 correction for the @xmath136 decay is around two - thirds the maximum one and that for the @xmath137 decay is around one - eighth the maximum one ( table [ tab : beta ] ) .",
    "such a ratio quantity exhibits a general trend of increasing @xmath128 isospin mixing with @xmath9 within same isospin multiplets and as well it reveals enhanced @xmath68 decays to the ground state of even - even @xmath10 nuclei with increasing @xmath128 towards the middle of the shell .",
    "furthermore , the ratio retains its behavior for the non - analog @xmath100 decays between nuclei with the same valence proton and neutron numbers as in table [ tab : beta ] but occupying the @xmath71 major shell .",
    "therefore , among the non - analog @xmath100 decays for the @xmath138 isobars with valence protons and neutrons in the @xmath71 shell the @xmath128 isospin mixing of the @xmath139 decay is expected to be the largest with a tendency of a further increase towards the middle of the shell . in short , the significance of the isospin mixing caused by a charge dependent @xmath21 pairing correlations is evident from table [ tab : beta ] for the @xmath11 level and continues this trend for the upper @xmath140 shell .",
    "the small mixing of the @xmath2 isospin eigenstates from different isospin multiplets yields very small but nonzero @xmath141 matrix elements for non - analog @xmath142 decay transitions as indicated by @xmath121 in table [ tab : beta ] . for nuclei in the @xmath11 shell , such non - analog transitions to",
    "energetically accessible states are shown in figure [ cabetadecays ] along with the @xmath103 values ( where we use @xmath143 @xcite ) . in the framework of the @xmath25 model , these values are symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath7 [",

    "the results yield that ten of the transitions are classified as forbidden ( @xmath149 ) , other four are suppressed ( @xmath150 ) and the four decays to the ground state of an even - even @xmath10 nucleus appear to have comparatively larger decay rates ( @xmath151 ) . in figure [ cabetadecays ] the theoretically calculated isobaric analog @xmath2",
    "state   energies are shown together with the available experimental ones .",

    "this outcome is important because the energy difference between two isobaric analog @xmath2 states   within a nucleus directly affects the degree of their mixing . in summary ,",
    "the theoretical @xmath25 model suggests the possible existence , albeit highly hindered , of @xmath123 non - analog @xmath3-decay transitions .",
    "we employed a group - theoretical approach based on the @xmath25 dynamical symmetry to describe microscopically a possible isospin mixing induced by a short - range charge dependent nuclear interaction .",
    "the @xmath25 model interaction incorporates the main driving forces , including @xmath21 pairing correlations and implicit quadrupole - quadrupole term , that shape the nuclear pairing - governed isobaric analog @xmath2 states  in the @xmath11 level where the @xmath25 hamiltonian correlates strongly with realistic interactions .",
    "this approach provides a reasonable reproduction not only of the energies of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath2 states  in total of 149 nuclei .",
    "it also reproduces the available experimental energies of the higher - lying isobaric analog @xmath2 states  in the @xmath11 level and fine structure effects without any variation of the parameters of the model interaction . in this respect ,",
    "as predicted by our model , the coefficient related to the isotensor part of a general non - conserving force , @xmath80 , which has been recently found to be dominated by a charge dependent @xmath21 pairing interaction @xcite , agrees quite well with the experimental values .",
    "the isospin - symmetry breaking due to coupling of isobaric analog @xmath2 states   in nuclei was estimated to be extremely small for nuclei in the @xmath70 and @xmath11 orbitals with the @xmath10 even - even nuclei being an exception .",
    "for these nuclei , strong pairing correlations , including a significant @xmath1 interaction , are responsible for the existence of comparatively larger isospin mixing , although the latter is still at least an order of a magnitude smaller than the overall isospin admixture in the ground state .",
    "the results also show that a variation of more than 60% in the @xmath61 isospin mixing parameter is required to reduce the present @xmath121 results by an order of a magnitude .",
    "the analysis also shows that there is a trend of increasing isospin mixing between isobaric analog @xmath2 states  due to a charge dependent @xmath21 pairing interaction towards the middle of the shell and for @xmath68 decays to the ground state of an even - even @xmath10 daughter nucleus .",

    "for nuclei with valence protons and neutrons occupying the @xmath11 level the strongest non - analog decay is identified to be @xmath153 , while the @xmath121 isospin mixing correction for the rest of the decays is 2/3 to 1/300 the maximum one .    in short ,",
