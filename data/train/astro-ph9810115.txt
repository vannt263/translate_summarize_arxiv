    "in order to cover the entire sky we performed four runs of optical observations . in november 1996 and july 1997",

    "from the spectral fits we classified our objects as agn using diagnostic diagrams ( fig .  2 ) following baldwin et al .",
    "we also determined the agn type . following the osterbrock ( 1989 ) definition we classified the agn in seyfert types according to the relative strength of narrow to broad components of the h@xmath5  and h@xmath6  emission lines .",

    "( 1989 ) one can quantify the radio - quiet or radio - loud nature of our objects .",
    "the ratio of radio to optical flux density for most objects is below 10 and objects below such a value are considered as radio - quiet ( of course , there is no strict dividing line between radio - quiet and radio - loud objects ) .",
    "the most intense radio emitters in our sample ( rx  j011232.8 - 320140 and ngc  1218 ) show a radio to optical flux ratio of about 275 .    from the rass count rate we calculated the x - ray flux assuming a power - law spectrum with fixed photon spectral index @xmath8 , which is the typical value found for extragalactic objects with rosat ( cf .",

    "we do not correct for absorption of the x - rays within the galaxy .",
    "therefore , our x - ray fluxes derived with this method have to be understood as lower limits of the intrinsic fluxes if the x - rays are emitted from active nuclei within the galaxies .",
    "the optical b magnitudes were taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) . if no b magnitude was available in ned we took the magnitude from the pgc ( paturel et al .",
    "for viizw608e ( eastern component ) and the companion of mcg+07 - 37 - 018 the magnitudes were estimated from our acquisition images . the monochromatic flux at 4400  @xmath10 and the total far - infrared ( 40 - 120@xmath11 m ) fluxes @xmath12 were calculated as described in pietsch et al .  ( 1998 ) .",
    "to compute absolute magnitudes and luminosities we adopted a hubble constant @xmath13 and cosmological deceleration parameter of @xmath14 .",
    "most of our sources turn out to harvest an active nucleus or even merging nuclei where at least one component is active .",
    "it is , however , not yet clear if these active nuclei really are the source of the x - rays .",
    "* information about source extension from the rass catalog : if a source is extended the major part of the x - ray emission will not originate in the nucleus ( 8% of the sources ) .",
    "* unresolved hri detection of a source centered on the nucleus strongly argues for a nuclear origin of the x - rays ( 24% of the sources ) .",
    "* time variability in the x - ray flux rules out emission from extended gas clouds and strongly argues for an agn ( 24% of the sources ) .",
    "* comparision of measured x - ray luminosity with those expected from the agn / morphology type of the galaxy or for the galaxy surroundings ( group or cluster environment ) can give hints on the origin of the x - rays .",
    "in some cases this would argue for an origin of the x - ray emission in the surrounding group or cluster ( 16% of the sources ) ; hot gas in the early type host galaxy could explain the x - ray emission for others ( 13% of the sources ) .",
    "* line fitting analysis of prominent optical emission lines : the location of our objects in the diagnostic diagrams of osterbrock ( 1989 ) clearly demonstrates their agn nature ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : baldwin ] ) ( 47% of the sources ) .",
    "the flux ratios are an additional indication of the agn character of the objects . using the nomograph shown in fig .  1 of maccacaro et al .  ( 1988 )",
    ", one sees that the combined x - ray flux and optical m@xmath15 of our objects agree well with those expected from agn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] , middle panel ) .",
    "the right panel gives the ratio of the x - ray to far - infrared ( 40 - 120 @xmath4 ) flux .",
    "all of the objects show flux ratios above a value of 0.01 . as shown in fig .  5 of boller et al .  ( 1998 ) most agn exhibit flux ratios above that value .",
    "theoretical models addressing the x - ray and far - infrared emission of galaxies in different states of nuclear activity suggest that flux ratios above about 0.01 require agn activity , whereas values below about 0.01 can be explained by starburst activity ( bertoldi & boller , in preparation ) .",
    "the results of our optical follow up observing runs have demonstrated that our selection strategy from the rass bright source catalog  pgc correlations is rather efficient in detecting new active galactic nuclei . from all observations we expect the detection of about 100 new members of the nearby agn population .",
