    "the twentieth century we have just left behind opened with the discovery of quanta by planck ( 1900 ) and followed with the formulation of the quantum theory during the first decades .",
    "as the century went by , we have witnessed a continuous and growing increase in the number of applications of quantum mechanics , which began with atomic physics and then the number kept growing ( nuclear and particle physics , optics , condensed matter ,  ) and became countless . as the century was closing we have come across an unexpected new field of applications that have given quantum physics a refreshing twist , keeping the pace even with the newest trends of discoveries , such as the field of new technologies of information and computation . in a sense and having in mind the times we live , those of the information era and the new technologies , it seems inevitable that physics gets affected by the presence of computers all over around , which are more and more powerful and have revolutionized many areas of science .",
    "what is more surprising is the fact that quantum physics may influence the field of information and computation in a new and profound way , getting at the very root of their foundations . for instance",
    ", fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics such as those entering the epr ( einstein , podolsky and rosen , 1935 ) states have found unexpected applications in information transmission and cryptography .",
    "but , why has this happened ?",
    "it all begun by realizing that information has physical nature ( landauer , 1991 ; 1996 ; 1961 ) .",
    "it is printed on a physical support ( the rocky wall of a cave , a clay tablet , a parchment , a sheet of paper , a magneto - optic disk , etc . ) , it can not be transmitted faster than light in vacuum , and it abides by the natural laws .",
    "the statement that information is physical does not simply mean that a computer is a physical object , but in addition that information itself is a physical entity . in turn",
    ", this implies that the laws of information are restricted or governed by the laws of physics . in particular , those of quantum physics . in fact these ones , through their linearity ,",
    "entanglement of states , nonlocality and indetermination principle make possible new and powerful transmission tools and information treatments , as well as a really prodigious efficiency of computation .",
    "a typical computation is implemented through an algorithm in a computer .",
    "this algorithm is now regarded as a set of physical operations and the registers of the quantum computer are considered to be states of a quantum system .",
    "moreover , the familiar operation of initializing the data for a program to run is replaced by the preparation of an initial quantum state , and the usual tasks of writing programs and running them correspond , in the new formulation , to finding appropriate hamiltonians for their time evolution operators to lead to the desired output .",
    "this output is retrieved by a quantum measurement of the register , and this fact has deep implications on the way quantum information must be handled .",
    "we shall see that information and computation blend well with quantum mechanics .",
    "their combination brings unexpected results on the way information can be transmitted and processed , extending the capabilities known so far in the field of classical information to unsuspected limits , sometimes entering the realm of science - fiction , sometimes surpassing it .",
    "the advance has been remarkable mainly in the field of cryptography , where it has provided systems absolutely secure for the quantum distribution of keys .",
    "quantum computation is also one of the hot research fields in current physics ; the same applies to the challenge posed by the experimental realization of a computer complex enough to implement the new algorithms that exploit the fantastic possibilities of the massive parallelism characterizing those quantum computers , and that would amount to a dramatic improvement for solving hard or classically untractable problems .",
    "we first review the essentials of quantum information theory and then discuss several of their consequences and applications , some of them specifically quantum such as quantum teleportation , dense coding ; some of them with a classical echo such as quantum cryptography .",
    "next we review the fundamentals of quantum computation describing the notion of a quantum turing machine and its practical implementation with quantum circuits .",
    "we describe the notion of elementary quantum gates for universal computation and how this extends the classical counterpart .",
    "we also provide a discussion of the basic quantum algorithms and finally we give a general overview of some of the possible physical realizations of quantum computers .",
    "both in the information and computation parts we make special emphasis in presenting first an introduction to the classical aspects of these disciplines in order to better clarify what quantum theory adds to them in the new formulations of these theories .",
    "actually , this is also what we do in physics .",
    "information is discretized : it comes in irreducible packages .",
    "the elementary unit of classical information is the _ bit _ ( or _ cbit _ , for classic bit ) , a classical system with only two states 0 and 1 ( false and true , no and yes ,  ) . any text can be coded into a string of bits : for instance , it is enough to assign to each symbol its ascii code number in binary form , appended with a parity check bit .",
    "example : quanta can be coded as    .... 11100010 11101011 11000011 11011101 11101000 11000011 ....    each bit can be stored physically ; in classical computers , each bit is registered as a charge state of a capacitor ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "they are distinguishable macroscopic states , and robust enough or stable .",
    "they are not spoiled when they are read in ( if carefully done ) and they can be cloned or replicated without any problem .",
    "information is not only stored ; it is usually transmitted ( communication ) , and sometimes processed ( computation ) .",
    "the classical theory of information is due to shannon ( 1948,1949 ) , who in two seminal works definitively laid down its principles in 1948 . with his celebrated _ noiseless coding theorem _ he showed how much _",
    "compressible _ a message can be , or equivalently , how much redundancy it has .",
    "likewise with his _ coding theorem in a noisy channel _ he also found what is the minimum redundancy that must be present into a message in order to be _ comprehensible _ when reaching the receiver , despite of the noise .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite alphabet , endowed with a probability distribution @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "sometimes we shall be write this as @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider messages or character strings @xmath5 , originating from a memoryless source , i.e. , a symbol @xmath6 appears in a given place with probability @xmath7 , independently of the symbols entering the remaining sites in the chain .",
    "the first shannon s theorem asserts that , if @xmath8 , the information supplied by a generic message of @xmath9 characters ( and thus ( @xmath10)-bits long ) essentially coincides with that transmitted by another shorter message , of bit length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the so called shannon s entropy @xmath13 . \\label{qi1}\\ ] ]    in other words , each character is compressible up to @xmath14 bits on the average ; moreover , this result is optimal ( welsh , 1995 ; roman 1992 ; schumacher , 1995 ; preskill , 1998 ) .",
    "the basic idea underlying the proof is simple : it amounts to take notice only of the _ typical _ messages .",
    "let us assume for clarity a binary alphabet ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be the probabilities of 0,1 , respectively . in a long message of @xmath9 bits ( @xmath17 )",
    ", there will be approximately @xmath18 0s .",
    "let us call typical messages those with a number of 0s of the order of @xmath18 .",
    "asymptotically ( @xmath19 ) , there are @xmath20 many of them , among a total of @xmath21 messages .",
    "the probability @xmath22 of the messages ( @xmath17)-bits long tends to get concentrated on this reduced ensemble consisting of the typical strings , which explains shannon s result .",
    "the atypical messages are ignorable in probability .",
    "it suffices to transmit through the communication channel ( assumed perfect , noiseless ) the binary number of length @xmath11 assigned to each typical message upon common agreement between the sender and the recipient , so that the emitted message can be identified on reception .",
    "the optimality of shannon s first theorem is easily arguable : all @xmath20 typical sequences are asymptotically equiprobable and thus they can not be represented faithfully with less than @xmath11 bits .    if the transmission channel is noisy ( the common case ) , the information fidelity gets lost , since some bits may get corrupted along the way . to fight the noise of a given channel one resorts to redundancy , by cleverly coding each symbol with more bits than strictly necessary so that the erroneous bits might be easily detected and restored .",
    "a price is payed however , since the transmission of essential information gets clearly slower .",
    "shannon s wonderful second theorem quantifies this issue .",
    "let @xmath23 be the alphabet of the transmitter station ( of a memoryless source ) , and @xmath24 be the one of the receiver station .",
    "let @xmath25 be the stochastic matrix for that channel , with entries given by the probabilities that the input symbol @xmath26 appears as @xmath27 on output . the marginal probability distribution for @xmath24 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the channel ability to transmit information is measured by its _ capacity _",
    "@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the _ mutual information _",
    "@xmath31    or the information about @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) conveyed by @xmath24 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the convexity of the log makes @xmath32 ( knowing @xmath24 can never lower the information about @xmath23 ) .",
    "the capacity @xmath33 may be viewed as the number of output bits per input symbol which are correctly transmitted .",
    "its computation is usually very difficult .",
    "many channels are binary symmetric : each transmitted bit has the same probability @xmath34 of being reversed , i.e. , of being erroneous upon arrival .",
    "these are the channels considered here . for them",
    "we have @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 , being such a channel totally useless for transmission since it transforms any input binary word into a random ouput sequence .",
    "thus we will assume that @xmath38 .    in the transmission of a word @xmath39 ,",
    "an error @xmath40 may be produced such that the received word is @xmath41 ( addition mod 2 ) .",
    "a subset of words @xmath42 encoding ( i.e. in bijective correspondence with ) a collection of messages is said to be an _ error - correcting classical code _",
    "( eccc ) for @xmath43 if @xmath44 for any @xmath45 .",
    "that is , no matter the distortion produced by the errors on a codeword @xmath46 , there is no overlapping between the different sets @xmath47 , and the decoding is possible without ambiguities .",
    "if upon previous agreement , it is known which specific message corresponds to each codeword , it will be enough to send this one instead of the message ; the latter will be capable of being recovered at the other side of the channel after  cleaning - up \" the received word from the possible errors which can affect it . in this way the transmitted codeword can be identified and its decoding done afterwards . in the practical use of a code @xmath48 , mistakes can occur in the restoration of the messages , caused by errors outside @xmath49 , that is , out of the security framework of the code .",
    "but as long as the frequency of failures remains very low , the risk will be bearable .",
    "it is apparent that for this to happen it will be convenient to put very distant apart ( in the hamming sense , that is , in the number of bits in which they differ ) the different words of the code , for the possibility that the errors will cause collisions between two distinct words of code will diminish in this fashion .",
    "one defines the _ rate _ of the code @xmath48 as @xmath50 .",
    "it measures the number of informative bits per transmitted bit .",
    "it is easy to argue that in order for the code to be reliable , its rate must not overcome the capacity of the channel : @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , when transmitting a codeword @xmath52 with length @xmath9 , there will be produced a number of @xmath18 reversed bits on average , and hence an error @xmath53 which will be likely one of the @xmath54 typical sequences . for the decoding to be reliable , there should be no overlapping between the error spheres with centers at the codewords , and thus @xmath55 , thereby @xmath51 .",
    "this result suggests that the capacity @xmath33 is an upper bound to all faithful transmission rates .",
    "the second shannon s theorem closes this issue in the asymptotic limit .",
    "suppose given a binary symmetric channel , a transmission rate @xmath56 not exceeding the capacity of the channel ( @xmath57 ) , an @xmath58 arbitrarily small and any sequence @xmath59 of integers such that @xmath60 .",
    "then , the theorem asserts that there exist codes @xmath61 with @xmath62 elements ( codewords ) , appropriate decision schemes for decoding , and an integer @xmath63 , such that the _ fidelity _ @xmath64 or probability that a given decoded message coincides with the original is @xmath65 ( that is , the maximum probability of error in the identification of the codeword on reception is @xmath66 ) for all @xmath67 ( roman , 1992 ; welsh , 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , it is possible to make the error probabilities to tend to 0 , exponentially in @xmath9 .",
    "the theorem is optimal : the capacity @xmath33 should not be exceeded if the transmission is to be faithful . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is known that for each sequence of codes @xmath68 with @xmath69 , whose rate exceeds the capacity of the channel ( @xmath70 ) , the average error probability tends asymptotically to 1 .",
    "the proof of this shannon s theorem relies on codes chosen at random and decoding schemes based on the maximum likelihood principle ; unfortunately , it is not constructive , but existential , leaving open the practical problem of finding out codes which cleverly combine a good efficiency in correcting errors , a simple decoding and a high rate .",
    "errors in the storage and processing of the information are unavoidable .",
    "a classical way of correcting them is resorting to _ redundancy _ ( repetition codes ) : each bit is substituted by a string of @xmath71 bits equal to it , @xmath72    and , if by any chance , an error occurs in such a way that one of the bits in one of those strings gets reversed ( for instance @xmath73 ) , to correct the error it is enough to invoke the majority vote .",
    "let @xmath34 be probability for any bit to get spoiled .",
    "in general , several bits of the @xmath9-tuple may be reversed . when @xmath38 , the probability for the majority rule to fail can be made as smaller as desired , taking @xmath9 sufficiently large .",
    "it is apparent that if the @xmath9-tuples of bits are systematically and frequently examined , so that it is very unlikely that errors occur at two or more bits , then the application of this simple method will clean - up the @xmath9-tuples from errors and their error - free state will be restored .",
    "however , the price to pay might be too high since with codes of length @xmath9 sufficiently large so as to insure a small error during the detection , the transmission rate can turn up prohibitively small ( in our case it is @xmath74 source bits per channel bit ) .",
    "so far , we have been describing correction codes @xmath75 for errors in @xmath76 .",
    "more generally , we can consider @xmath77-ary alphabets ( whose symbols we shall assume to be the elements of the finite field @xmath78 with @xmath79 elements , @xmath34 being a prime ) .",
    "given two words @xmath80 , let @xmath81 be its hamming distance ( number of locations in which @xmath82 differ ) .",
    "let @xmath83 be the minimum distance of the code .",
    "then , the code @xmath84 allows the correction of errors that affect to a maximum number @xmath85 of positions : ( @xmath86 ) is the largest ( smallest ) integer @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "] it is enough to replace each received word by the closest codeword in the hamming metric.@xmath89 , with @xmath77 codewords of length @xmath9 , we have @xmath90 , and thus it exactly corrects @xmath91 errors . ] therefore , the most convenient codes are those with a high @xmath92 , but this is at the expense of decreasing @xmath93 . if @xmath94 is the number of codewords , we shall call it a @xmath95 code .",
    "its rate is defined as @xmath96 .    when @xmath84 is a linear subspace of @xmath97 , the code is called _ linear_. therefore the linear codes are of the form @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the dimension of the linear subspace @xmath84 ; for them @xmath92 coincides with the minimal hamming length of a non - vanishing codeword , and the searching of the codeword nearest to each received word is greatly simplified .",

    "the coding applies bijectively and linearly @xmath109 onto a code @xmath110 of type @xmath98 , and it is implemented as follows .",

    "firstly , we have placed grover s algorithm in the category of brute force algorithms .",
    "the strategy is similar to its classical counterpart , which is of brute force type .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that the quantum operation is realized through a unitary operator which implements the reversible quantum computation .",
    "although the brute force technique gives usually low efficient algorithms , it is very important for several reasons .",
    "one is that there are important cases , like the searching problem , where the brute force method outperforms more sophisticated strategies like divide - and - conquer .",
    "we find grover s algorithm as a realization of the brute force technique at the quantum level and this is why it is so simple and of general purpose at the same time .",
    "secondly , we have included shor s algorithm in the category of transform - and - conquer algorithms . as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ sec10d : level2 ] , shor solves the factorization problem by reducing it to the problem of finding the period of a certain function in number theory , which in turn is solved with the aid of the fundamentals of quantum computation . having realized this ,",
    "we point out that the classical version of transform - and - conquer algorithms are very rare ( anany , 1999 ) .",
    "this may explain why shor s algorithm , although more powerful than grover s , it has a more reduced range of applications .",
    "thirdly , the most notorious aspect of table  [ tableqalgo ] is the absence of quantum algorithms based on the divide - and - conquer technique , which is by far the most general and used strategy in classical computation .",
    "this may partly account for the list of quantum algorithms being so short .",
    "moreover , if we resort to the basic features of quantum computation ( table  [ table3 ] ) we may explain somehow why this entry is empty in table  [ tableqalgo ] .",
    "we know that a quantum register supports the superposition of many states at the same time .",
    "this implies that the qubits of the quantum registers are strongly correlated ( entangled ) and their joint state is not separable into a product of states of smaller subregisters .",
    "thus quantum parallelism and entanglement render unnatural any try to implement the strategy of divide - and - conquer in a quantum register at least in a straightforward and naive fashion .",

    "however , these devices are very modest in size and the real breakthrough will be to scale them up to sizes capable of doing tasks not yet done with classical computers , like code - breaking with shor s algorithm or database searching with grover s algorithm .    before giving an overview of a few experimental proposals , it is convenient to summarize what they all have in common .",

    "the system of qubits must be accessible for external manipulations : to read in the input state and read out the output , as well as during the computation if the quantum algorithm requires it .",
    "interestingly enough , some of the possible qubits and quantum logic gates have been with us since the early times of bohr .",
    "for example , the quantum not - gate is obtained , at least in principle , either by exciting an atomic ground state to an upper level with a photon of apppropriate frecuency and time length , or by induced emission .",

    "the list of experimental proposals is too large by now to be covered in detail .",
    "instead , we shall focus on one of the most original proposals for doing solid - state quantum computation : this is kane s idea ( 1998 ) for building a silicon - based quantum computer .",
    "this is an appealing program for kane envisages the possibility of using the semiconductors used in most conventional computer electronics for building also a quantum computer , although the challenges to achieve this goal are still enormous .",
    "the belief though is that the silicon technology is a very rapidly developing field and there are chances to overcome those challenges .",
    "the quantum hardware in kane s proposal is an array of nuclear spins located on donors in silicon .",
    "then , a qubit is the individual nuclear spin of phosphor @xmath737p atoms ; a quantum register is the whole array of @xmath737p dopants in silicon @xmath738si ; operations are effected using a combination of magnetic resonance techniques ( rabi pulses ) with static electric fields ; information is exchanged between nearby @xmath737p nuclear spins by means of the surrounding electrons .",
    "the choice of nuclear spins in this case is again motivated by their extremely well isolation from the environment , like in the nmr proposal .",
    "a further requirement now is that the dopant spins must not interact appreciably with the spins of the host semiconductor . to guarantee this we demand that the chemical elements of the host have zero nuclear spin @xmath739 , to avoid undesired spin couplings",
    "this singles out the semiconductor group v as a host candidate and removes other groups like iii ( with ga ) and iv ( with as ) .",
    "silicon @xmath738si is an example of stable isotope in group v.    unlike the nmr liquid spectroscopy , kane s qc is neither a bulk spin quantum computation nor resorts to macroscopic magnetization measurements .",
    "instead , it truly needs addressing spins individually for initialization and readout , and this is precisely one of the open challenges .",
    "the basic ingredient in kane s proposal is to trade direct nuclear spin interactions by electronic detections , which are likely to be easier to handle .",
    "thus , the spin state of an individual nucleus dopant on a semiconductor will not be detected directly , but through its hyperfine interaction with the surrounding electrons .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is proportional to the probability density of the electrons at the nucleus .",
    "the electronic cloud is sensitive to electric voltages and can in principle be externally manipulated .",
    "moreover , in certain cases the electronic wave functions extend far enough so as to overlap with a neighbouring atom , thereby producing an indirect coupling between nuclear spins mediated by the atomic electrons .",
    "this indirect electron coupling can also be enhanced by applying external electric fields .",
    "these conditions are met by shallow level donors like @xmath737p , for which the range of the electron wave function is of order 10 - 100  .",
    "in addition , within the group v , the only shallow donor in si with nuclear spin @xmath740 is precisely @xmath737p .",
    "therefore , the @xmath737p : si system is a good candidate for a silicon based quantum computer .",
    "for instance , at low @xmath737p concentrations and low temperature @xmath741 k , the electron spin relaxation time is order @xmath742 s , and the nuclear spin relaxation time is over 10 hours .",
    "if the temperature is further reduced to @xmath743 mk , the phonon limited @xmath737p relaxation time is likely of the order of @xmath744 s ( kane , 1998 ) .",
    "we see that in kane s idea the electrons play a role similar to phonons in the cirac - zoller gate : they both mediate the conditional interactions between the real qubits .",
    "likewise , we also need external electric fields to bring dopant nuclei close enough to interact . in all , we need to control three types of external fields :    \\1 ) electric gates above the donors to control individual electronic states ( see fig .  [ kaneqc ] ) .",

    "of the five outer ( 3p ) electrons in a @xmath737p atom ( one more than in si ) , four of them will form covalent bonds with neighouring si atoms , while the remaining fifth electron is loosely bound to the @xmath737p atom .",
    "this outer electron and the rest of the dopant atom behave in first approximation as a hydrogen - like atom embedded into a si environment . at low temperatures ,",
    "the electron state is 1s and this yields a large hyperfine interaction .",
    "the effective bohr radius is estimated at 30  . to proceed with the quantum computation",
    "we need this electron to remain in its ground state , and to apply an external constant magnetic field to break the spin degeneracy .",

    "since the number of movements to analyse grows exponentially with the board size , such problems are in * exp*. furthermore , it is believed that they are not in class * np*.    the following inclusions among the previous classes hold : @xmath882 moreover , it is also known that @xmath883 .",
    "thus , at least one of the three firts inclusions in the long previous chain must be proper .",
    "but it is ignored which one .",
    "the classification does not end here .",
    "there are even more `` monstrous '' problems , as far as complexity is concerned .",
    "for instance , pertaining to the presburger arithmetic there exists a problem doubly exponential at least ( time complexity @xmath884 in the size @xmath9 of the initial data ) .",
    "i/ class * rp * ( randomized polynomial ) , consisting of those decision problems that a ptm @xmath369 , always working in polynomial time ( for every initial data ) , decides with error @xmath885 .",
    "these problems are called polynomial monte carlo . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath638 denotes the set of input data having answer yes , i.e. , 1 , then @xmath886 this means that all computational pathways that a ptm @xmath369 can take from a data @xmath887 end up with rejection ( @xmath888 , i.e. , no ) , while if @xmath889 , then at least a fraction @xmath194 of the possible paths end up with acceptance ( @xmath890 ) . therefore , there can not be false positives , and at most a fraction @xmath194 of false negatives can happen ( cases in which @xmath889 and however the followed path ends with rejection ) . repeating the computation with the same @xmath889 a number of times @xmath891 , where @xmath892",
    ", we will be able to get that the probability of @xmath9 consecutive false negatives be @xmath893 and thus as small as desired by appropriately choosing @xmath190 , or equivalently , that the probability to obtain in that series of @xmath9 trials some acceptance of @xmath324 be @xmath894 and thus as close to 1 as we wish . in cases of real `` bad luck '' it might happen that very long series would not contain any acceptance of @xmath324 ; that is why it is often said that such @xmath369 decides the problem in average case polynomial time .",
    "ii/ class @xmath895 ( zero - error probabilistc polynomial ) , where the class * corp * is the complement of * rp * , that is , it contains those decision problems that answer ( yes , no ) to an input iff there exists a problem in * rp * which answers ( no , yes ) to the same input .",
    "these problems are called polynomial las vegas : they are monte carlo , and so are their complements . in other words , they have two monte carlo algorithms , one without false positives , and another one without false negatives .",
    "most likely any input data will be decidable with certainty : it is enough that the algorithm without false positives says yes , or the one without false negatives says no . in case of real bad luck , we shall have to repeat both until one of them yields a conclusive answer .",
    "example : primality is in * zpp*. the miller - selfridge - rabin algorithm ( pseudo - primality strong test , 1974 ) is of comontecarlo type , that is , primality is in * corp * ( in fact , the probability of false positives , i.e. , that one probable prime be composite , is @xmath899 ) . that primality in also in * rp * is a harder issue , and was proved by adleman and huang ( 1987 ) , with the theory of abelian varieties ( generalization of elliptic curves to higher dimensions ) .",
    ", there exists a deterministic primality - testing algorithm , due to adleman - pomerance - rumely - cohen - lenstra ( 1980 - 81 ) , with complexity @xmath900 , where @xmath901 is a constant .",
    "a current typical computer takes about 30 s for @xmath603 with 100 decimal digits , about 8 min if @xmath603 has 200 digits , and a reasonable time for 1000 digits . ]      * bpp * problems are perhaps those representing best the notion of realistic computations .",
    "they are accepted or rejected by a ptm with the possibility to err .",
    "but the error probability is @xmath903 both on the acceptance as well as on the rejection .",
    "repetition of the algorithm with the same input allows to amplify the probability of success , and , using the majority rule , to decide within polynomial time ( average case time , except in bad luck instances ) and with an error as small as required .",
    "it is not known whether @xmath904 , although it is believed that @xmath905 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath906 , and likewise @xmath907 .",
    "generically : @xmath908                    the proper inclusion of * p * in * qp * , shown by berthiaume and brassard ( 1992 ) , is very remarkable .",
    "it means that quantum computers can solve efficiently more problems than their classical kin .",
    "it amounts to the first clear victory in the strict separation of classical and quantum complexities .",
    "the second chain of inclusions is due to bernstein and vazirani ( 1993 ) .",
    "it remains open the crucial question of whether @xmath911 or not . that is , are there quantum `` tractable '' problems which are classically hard ?",
    "simon s algorithm ( subsec .",
    "[ sec10b : level2 ] ) is a first positive indication in the presence of a quantum oracle .",
    "another fact supporting this point comes from shor s algorithm ( subsec .",
    "[ sec10d : level2 ] ) , showing that factorization and discrete logarithm are in * bqp * , whereas the current state of the art does not allow us to assert that they are in * bpp*. the inclusion of * bqp * in * pspace * implies that it is possible to classically simulate , and with as good aproximation as desired , quantum problems with reasonable memory resources , although the simulation would be exponentially slow in time .",
    "that is why there are not solvable problems with qtms escaping the domain of dtms .",
    "stated in a different way , quantum computation does not contradict the church - turing hypothesis ( subsec .",
    "[ sec8a : level2 ] ) . only invoking efficiency might classical tms yield to qtms .",
    "even though we do not know whether * bpp * is a proper subset of * bqp * , we do know classical particular cases of algorithms ( not complexity classes as a whole ) that can be speeded - up quantumly with respect to their classical running .",
    "simon s algorithm shows an exponential gain @xmath912 ( subsec .",
    "[ sec10b : level2 ] ) , and grover s shows a quadratic improvement @xmath913 ( subsec .",
    "[ sec10c : level2 ] ) .",
    "but is not always possible to speed - up the algorithm substancially .",
    "there are oracle problems which do not admit an essential quantum speed - up ; at the most it is possible to go from @xmath603 classical queries down to @xmath914 quantum queries .",
    "an example is the parity problem ( to find the parity of the number of non - zero bits of a string in @xmath915 , ( farhi et al . , 1998 ) ) .",
