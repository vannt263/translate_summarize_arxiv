    "athermal , cohesionless particulate materials such as dry grains and dense , non - brownian suspensions exhibit features that are generic to many non - ergodic , disordered ( glassy ) systems  @xcite . however , these granular materials are non - ergodic in the extreme sense , as they stay in a single configuration unless driven externally .",
    "exploration of configuration space is completely controlled by the driving protocol , and since cohesive forces are absent , fluid or solid - like behavior emerges purely as a response to external driving  @xcite .",
    "these systems are , thus , the epitome of athermal condensed matter .",
    "the objective of this article is to describe recent developments in constructing statistical ensembles for such athermal systems .",
    "we examine the history of statistical ensembles for granular materials , which began with the ideas of sam edwards  @xcite , describe recent developments in theory and experiments , and explore future applications .",
    "although thermal fluctuations are absent , granular systems nonetheless exhibit large fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this is exemplified by the exponential distribution of contact forces in jammed ( solid - like ) granular assemblies  @xcite , and large , intermittent stress fluctuations in quasistatic flows  @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of fluctuations with well - defined _ distributions _ that seem to depend on a handful of macroscopic parameters  @xcite suggests that statistical ensembles could prove to be an important tool for predicting the emergent properties of granular materials .",

    "[ s : intro ] , we discuss the special role of constraints in the enforcement of mechanical equilibrium , and how this differs from thermal ensembles . in  [ s : tests ] , we review the existing experimental and numerical tests of the ensembles and in  [ s : statmech ] describe how to use the distributions of microstates in an ensemble to calculate collective properties .",
    "these same techniques can be extended to systems with slow dynamics , and examples of this are provided in  [ s : dynamics ] .",
    "finally , we close with a summary of open questions in the field (  [ s : questions ] ) .",
    "twenty - five years ago , sam edwards and coworkers @xcite considered the problem of what sets the packing density of granular materials under simple operations such as shaking , stirring or compression .",
    "they proposed a statistical ensemble approach , which was formulated along lines paralleling that of equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , conservation of energy ( @xmath0 law ) implies that the total energy @xmath1 of an isolated system can not fluctuate .",
    "the set of microstates ( @xmath2 ) with a given total energy @xmath1 , calculated from the positions and momenta of all particles , form the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the macroscopic , extensive variable @xmath1 characterizes the ensemble , and all microstates with this energy are assumed to occur with equal probability .",
    "different physical systems are distinguished by the density of states @xmath3 .",
    "isolated systems are important only for establishing the foundations of thermodynamics , and the _ canonical _ ensemble describing a system in contact with a heat bath is characterized by an intensive macrosopic variable : the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it is useful to summarize the postulates used to arrive at the framework described above .",
    "in addition to energy conservation , which is dynamical in origin , the fundamental assumption underlying statistical mechanics is the equiprobability of microstates with a given energy , which also follows from the maximization of entropy @xcite .",
    "edwards and collaborators set about formulating an analogous theory of granular materials . due of frictional forces and dissipation , energy is not conserved in granular systems , it is therefore not an appropriate state variable .",
    "there are two aspects to the edwards formulation .",
    "one that is often forgotten is the assertion that the dynamics of slowly driven granular systems is controlled by the statistical properties of blocked states  @xcite . for",
    "infinitely rigid grains , these blocked microstates are composed of grains in mechanical equilibrium such that grains can not be moved without causing a finite overlap . in the modern parlance , these would be called jammed states @xcite . motivated by the central role that the packing density plays in determining the nature of jammed states , edwards proposed to replace the hamiltonian or energy function by a volume function and defined the analogous density of states : @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is now restricted to _",
    "jammed _ states , and is defined by just the positions of grains . following the steps of the development of thermodynamics , the edwards entropy is then defined as @xmath6 , which yields a canonical ensemble characterized by a corresponding temperature - like variable @xmath7 : @xmath8 which edwards named _ compactivity_. just as the boltzmann constant @xmath9 gives the ordinary entropy the correct units of j / k , the constant @xmath10 sets the units of compactivity relative to volume .",
    "similarly , one can write quantities analogous to the specific heat , the boltzmann distribution , etc . a summary of these ordinary statistical mechanical quantities , and their translations into the edwards ensemble ,",
    "is given in table .",
    "[ t : translate ] .",
    "although the edwards ensemble looks exactly like the ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics , it is different in one very important way : _ it is constrained to consider only those states that are blocked or jammed_. any calculation involving sums over states such as a partition function has to explicitly impose this constraint .",
    ".table of similar quantities from ordinary statistical mechanics and the original and generalized edwards ensemble . in practice",
    ", @xmath10 is often to be taken to have a value unity with units of 1/volume ( 1/stress for the generalized ensemble ) , for simplicity .",
    "note that the angoricity , unlike the other temperatures , is defined without a reciprocal .",
    "[ t : translate ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the name compactivity was chosen because it describes how far a system is from its densest possible state , beyond which no further compaction is possible .",
    "the extremal values of @xmath7 are chosen to give a sensible physical interpretation of the limits of validity of the ensemble .",
    "the lowest possible compactivity ( @xmath11 ) has come to be identified with random close packing , the densest packing for which no crystalline order is present  @xcite . the upper limit , at @xmath12 , is typically identified with random loose packing @xcite , the loosest packing for which mechanical stability is still present . beyond these values ,",
    "the ensemble is no longer defined .",
    "soon after the introduction of the edwards ensemble , it was realized that contact forces needed to be incorporated into the definition of jammed microstates .",
    "each grain must locally satisfy force and torque balance , and in the presence of friction these forces can not be deduced just from positions of grains .",
    "there was also a heightened awareness @xcite of the significance of earlier observations @xcite of what have come to be known as _",
    "force chains_. these are roughly co - linear chains of particles through which larger - than - average stresses are transmitted .",
    "these considerations led to the proposal of a generalized ensemble @xcite with stress as an additional governing state variable ; the corresponding temperature - like variable was named _",
    "angoricity _ by edwards , from the modern greek word @xmath13 , meaning `` stress . ''",
    "there is a growing consensus that the force moment tensor @xmath14 is the extensive variable most closely analogous to energy in equilibrium statistical mechanics : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vector pointing from the center of particle @xmath17 to the interparticle contact with its neighbor particle @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the interparticle contact force , and the sum is over all pairs of grains .",
    "these quantities are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : exp - forces ] , along with sample images illustrating how they are measured in experiments .",
    "unlike the volume @xmath20 , @xmath14 depends on both the positions of grains and their interparticle contact forces . because the force moment is a tensorial quantity ,",
    "the angoricity is a tensor as we well : @xmath21 as the @xmath22 component of the force moment tensor goes to zero ( corresponding to a loss of rigidity ) , we expect the corresponding angoricity to tend to to infinity . since the original proposal ,",
    "a number of different formulations for the stress ensemble have been published @xcite .     at each interparticle contact , shown schematically as the white arrows .",
    "( c ) schematic of calculation of force moment tensor @xmath14 according to eq .  [ fmt_def ] , using @xmath23 and the vector @xmath16 pointing from the center of particle @xmath17 to the interparticle contact with particle @xmath18 .",
    "dashed lines connect the center of particle @xmath17 with the center of each particle it is in contact with . [",
    "f : exp - forces],height=192 ]      the volume and stress ensembles described in the previous section have come to be collectively known as generalized edwards ensembles @xcite , and are distinct from ordinary statistical mechanical ensembles in important ways .",
    "first , they are completely non - ergodic . because there is no temporal evolution",
    ", there is no equivalence of time averages and ensemble averages .",
    "this peculiarity arises because granular materials are athermal : at room temperature , the thermal energy is many orders of magnitude lower than required to move one grain over another against the force of gravity .",
    "for example , a millimeter - sized grain of sand would require @xmath24  j to move upward its own diameter against the force of gravity . at room temperature ( 300 k ) , this corresponds to @xmath25 and therefore thermal motion is statistically negligible . as such ,",
    "all granular systems require external driving to explore new configurations , and the edwards ensemble ( or its variants ) can only be interpreted as an ensemble of microstates created by independent realizations with certain macroscopic parameters held fixed .",
    "another type of granular ensemble is that of subsystems within a single thermodynamically large system . in this context",
    ", `` thermalization '' refers to the establishment of equal angoricity and compactivity in these different subsystems .",
    "this granular thermalization is distinct from the establishment of effective temperatures in glassy systems @xcite , where the effective temperatures encode the fluctuations of the slowly - relaxing modes , and are dynamical in nature .",
    "while the assumption of equiprobability of all valid microstates is well established for equilibrium statistical mechanics , the situation is less clear for the edwards ensembles .",
    "in fact , tests of the hypothesis for jammed states in experiments , simulations , and exactly solvable models reveal that equiprobability is not universally valid , but does hold under some conditions @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xcite used closely - matched simulations and experiments to generate millions of statistically - independent packings of seven disk - shaped particles . by enumerating all observed unique configurations , they observed that the same finite number of microstates was observed in both simulations and experiments , and that the relative frequencies of the these microstates was highly nonuniform ( they differ by factors of up to a million ) .",
    "however , equiprobability is itshape not essential for either the definition of compactivity @xcite or angoricity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been shown  @xcite that the edwards entropy can satisfy extensivity even without equiprobability , and that a factor of @xmath26 is necessary to avoid an athermal version of the gibbs paradox .",
    "if configurations are not equiprobable , one can generalize the definition of @xmath27 to include the weights of microstates : @xmath28 .",
    "the much weaker condition of factorability , @xmath29 , is necessary and sufficient for defining angoricity and compactivity @xcite . an important point to note",
    "is that , unlike @xmath30 , @xmath31 is not determined by any hamiltonian .",
    "a pragmatic perspective is to assert that different protocols lead to different microstate probability @xmath32 and therefore , to different @xmath31 .",
    "the ensemble approach is applicable , but each protocol would be like choosing a new hamiltonian that defines the density of states .",
    "the objective of a statistical ensemble framework is to predict the probability of occurrence of a microscopic configuration , given a set of macroscopic constraints . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , there are natural macroscopic constraints that emerge from conservation laws : energy , volume and number of particles . in",
    "jammed , athermal systems , there are similarly a natural set of macroscopic variables and their associated conservation principles .",
    "any microscopic jammed state of @xmath33 grains is completely specified by the positions of the grains and the forces ( including frictional forces ) at inter - grain contacts : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the position of the @xmath17-th grain and @xmath36 is the contact force between grains @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as in thermal systems , and in other jammed or glassy systems , a granular packing can exist in many different microscopic states for a fixed set of macroscopic variables such as volume or applied stress .",
    "in addition , there is a microscopic indeterminacy @xcite arising from the coulomb condition for static friction which imposes an inequality constraint : @xmath37 such that the magnitude of the tangential force @xmath38 can not exceed the static friction coefficient @xmath39 times the magnitude of the normal force @xmath40 .",
    "thus , there is a range of tangential forces that are allowed for any _ microscopic _ grain configuration .",
    "what , then , is a natural microcanonical ensemble for jammed states ?    to address this question , we start by examining the constraints that must be satisfied by jammed ( blocked ) microstates . for infinitely rigid grains , there is a strict constraint on the @xmath41 since grains can not overlap .",
    "the jammed states in the original edwards ensemble are then all of the `` just - touching '' configurations , and the volume occupied by @xmath33 grains is a macrosopic invariant : it is _ globally _ conserved . for grains that are not infinitely rigid , the non - overlapping constraint vanishes , and it is no longer clear what volume is conserved . of course",
    ", one can fix the total volume @xmath20 occupied by @xmath33 grains through the nominal packing fraction , but this is not a consequence of any constraints on jammed states . the constraints that remain are those of mechanical equilibrium , which involve the contact forces @xmath42 .",
    "these constraints lead to a robust conservation law involving the force - moment tensor  @xcite of the granular packing , @xmath43 , defined in eq .",
    "[ fmt_def ] , which is related to the cauchy stress tensor  @xcite @xmath44 : @xmath45    the conservation of the force - moment tensor arises purely from _ local _ constraints of force and torque balance .",
    "it holds for any material that is in mechanical equilibrium , regardless of dimensionality and microscopic details . here",
    ", we will demonstrate this conservation principle in a generic two dimensional @xmath46 solid using a continuum stress field , but a formulation that explicitly incorporates the discreteness of the granular assembly can also be constructed  @xcite .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath46 solid under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "mechanical equilibrium requires that the continuum stress field @xmath47 obeys force and torque balance everywhere . in the absence of body forces ,",
    "the continuum stress field satisfies @xmath48 due to force balance .",
    "local torque balance also requires @xmath49 .",

    ", a change has to be made on the non - contractible loop @xmath52 ( or @xmath51 ) . ]    for a 2d system under pbc ( equivalent to the surface of a torus ) , there are three classes of topologically distinct loops , labeled @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ loops ] . for any region enclosed by a topologically trivial ( contractible ) loop ( type @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the total force acting on it can be calculated by applying the divergence theorem to the stress field @xmath57 yielding the same result regardless of loop shape , which simply reflects force balance .",
    "there are also two classes of non - contractible loops : loops labeled @xmath51 that wrap around the torus in the @xmath58-direction and those labeled @xmath52 that wrap around in the @xmath59-direction .",
    "applying the divergence theorem leads to two vector quantities @xmath60 which do not depend on the particular paths loops @xmath51 and @xmath52 take .",
    "these vectors are topological invariants in the sense that all loops belonging to the same topological class , @xmath51 or @xmath52 , have the same value of @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively . for a granular system , which is inherently discrete , the loops are not , in the strict sense , continuously deformable since they have to pass through force - bearing contacts",
    "while the deformation of loops must obey the constraints of the underlying contact network , this does not change the topological invariance of @xmath61 .",
    "for each dimension ( here , there are two : @xmath62 ) , there is an invariant vector @xmath63 , which represents how much force is ` propagated ' through the material .",
    "these @xmath64-vectors are equivalent to the sum of cauchy traction vectors on a surface in continuum mechanics @xcite and are also a formal generalization of the concept of cartesian load proposed in ref .",
    "the @xmath64-vectors are related to the force moment tensor which is defined for discrete systems in eq .",
    "[ fmt_def ] and in continuum as @xmath65 via @xmath66 the extensive quantity @xmath14 has been used to construct the stress ensemble framework . however , from the preceding discussion , the natural `` conserved '' variables appear to be @xmath61 @xcite , which scale linearly with system size .",

    "a natural microcanonical ensemble for jammed states of grains is one with a fixed value of the force moment tensor , which plays the role of energy in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the force - moment tensor , @xmath14 , is an extensive quantity ( i.e. one that scales with system size ) , and one can define the generalized density of states : @xmath67 the constraints on the microstates @xmath2 are that ( i ) forces and torques are balanced on every grain , ( ii ) the coulomb condition for static friction is satisfied , and ( ii ) all forces are positive .",
    "if one now assumes factorization : @xmath68 , there is an exact analog of temperature , which is the tensorial angoricity @xmath69 : @xmath70 as was specified by eq .",
    "[ alpha_def ] .",
    "the preceding derivation is easily generalized to three dimensions .",
    "contractible loops become closed volumes and the three types of non - contractible surfaces correspond to the three invariants @xmath71 ; see also section  [ 3d ] .",
    "the original edwards ensemble can be generalized to one where @xmath20 and @xmath14 define a microcanonical ensemble , but with no assumption of equiprobability .",
    "this generalized edwards ensemble has much in common with statistical frameworks developed for glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "collective properties in both are determined by the complexity of the landscape of metastable states .",
    "for example , complexity in spin glasses is measured by the logarithm of the number of local free energy minima that have a given free energy density  @xcite .",
    "an analogous definition applies to the potential energy landscape of supercooled liquids  @xcite . for granular systems ,",
    "complexity is measured by the generalized entropy , @xmath72 with the caveat that the microstates in the edwards ensemble have to satisfy the constraints of mechanical equilibrium at zero temperature .",
    "the microcanonical formulation of the generalized edwards ensemble , which does not assume equiprobability , still assumes that the entropy is extensive ( factorization of @xmath73 ) .",

    "what the microcanonical formulation implies is the following : in a large system of grains that are jammed in a global volume @xmath74 with a global force - moment tensor @xmath75 , the probability of finding a microstate within a subsystem is given by the boltzmann - like distribution , @xmath76 where @xmath7 and @xmath69 depend only on @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this is a remarkably strong constraint on the probability of microstates in a non - equilibrium system . in general",

    "we discuss such tests for both experimental and numerical systems .    defining the ensemble for static grains",
    "is the conceptually difficult part .",
    "calculating the partition function is technically difficult because of the constraints that one still needs to take into account .",
    "an important point to make here is that establishment of a boltzmann - like distribution does not imply that the distribution of individual grain volumes or individual contact forces is exponential @xcite .",
    "this would be true only if granular materials were like ideal gases with no correlations . as we will discuss in section ",
    "[ s : statmech ] , granular materials are actually `` strongly interacting '' systems where the interactions arise from constraints rather than interaction potentials .",
    "in spite of thought - experiments proposed by theorists @xcite , experimentalists were slow to warm to performing laboratory tests of the applicability and validity of the ideas put forth by edwards .",
    "the earliest approach which gained traction was to consider analogs of the specific heat @xcite .",
    "a well - known result of ordinary statistical mechanics is that the energy fluctuations of a system around its mean value @xmath77 are related in a simple way to its specific heat at constant volume , via the relation @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , there is an analogous quantity @xmath79 for the edwards ensemble which allows you to measure relative changes in compactivity via observations of the volume fluctuations : @xmath80 here , the boltzmann - like @xmath10 factor has been dropped for simplicity .",
    "this relation was first used to measure the compactivity of a granular material subject to tapping @xcite and later on static packings prepared through varying degrees of fluidization @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of this volume _ fluctuation method _ is that it integrates from a state with known @xmath81 ; typically this is taken to be random loose packing , where @xmath82 .",
    "however , it does provide a way to measure the compactivity using only bulk measurements .    as a byproduct ,",
    "the measurements of the volume fluctuations themselves provide a probe of the edwards ensemble in the sense that a larger number of configurations corresponds to a larger @xmath83 .",
    "this susceptibility can be informative in its own right , as a hallmark of the approach to a critical point .",
    "an observation of a minimum in the fluctuations as a function of packing density @xcite has since been associated with the dilatancy transition @xcite .",
    "changes in such fluctuations have been observed in a variety of both experiments and simulations of static packings @xcite , but also in some systems with dynamics @xcite .",
    "this last case is a test of edwards original idea that ensembles could describe driven granular systems , and therefore hints at the validity of this aspect of the edwards ensemble beyond strictly jammed states .",
    "a second technique for measuring compactivity was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they observed that while the density of states @xmath27 and the partition function @xmath84 may be unknown for a given granular ensemble , @xmath27 is identical for the same system under two different conditions . for any particular macroscopic volume @xmath20 , the probability @xmath85 of observing that volume",
    "is given by @xmath86 if you have measurements of @xmath87 for the same system under two different preparations ( enumerated 1 , 2 ) , the ratio of those two histograms will be @xmath88 therefore , by taking logarithm of the ratio and fitting the data to determine the slope @xmath89 , it is possible to measure changes in the compactivity .",
    "if you have a reference point ( again , commonly @xmath82 ) , then this can also be used as an absolute measurement .",
    "this technique was first realized by @xcite , who measured these quantities in both simulations and experiments using local vorono volumes calculated from tomographs of an assembly of millimetric glass spheres . because the histograms were nearly gaussian , it was difficult to make quantitative conclusions beyond a verification that the technique worked : values of @xmath7 measured using either eq .",
    "[ e : specificheat ] or [ e : overlapping2 ] were in approximate agreement . this same _ overlapping histogram method _",
    "was used on disk - shaped particles in a quasi - two - dimensional packing @xcite , where it was observed to be properly intensive for assemblies of at least 200 particles citepzhao2014 . note that this technique for measuring compactivity does not rely on equiprobability , and is insensitive to it since the factor @xmath27 in eq .",
    "[ e : overlapping2 ] cancels out whatever its form .",
    "three other methods of calculating @xmath7 are available for evaluation .",
    "first , using the histograms of local ( vorono ) volumes , it is possible to measure @xmath7 directly by fitting a gamma distribution and considering the ratio of the mean free volume to the shape factor of the gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "second , an equation of state relating the structural degrees of freedom and the number of independent boundary forces provides a fourth means of measuring @xmath7 , for isostatic packings @xcite .",
    "a recent comparison of these two methods shows that they are not necessarily in quantitative agreement with the techniques described by eq .",
    "[ e : specificheat ] and [ e : overlapping2 ] @xcite . finally , it is possible , through simulations , to both count particle configurations and to take the limit @xmath90 in a thermal system .",
    "using such methods on a simulation of slowly - sheared particles , the thermal @xmath91 ( measured via the diffusivity and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) was found to compare favorably with the compactivity @xcite .    while these experiments have demonstrated the utility of the edwards formulation as a description of a system , this was merely a confirmation that compactivity was measurable , not that it represented a truly temperature - like quantity .",
    "a more stringent test , as for ordinary thermodynamics , lies with the 0@xmath92 law of thermodynamics .",
    "a minimal expectation of a temperature - like quantity is that it have the ability to equilibrate between a subsystem and a bath . in experiments on a low - friction subsystem within a high - friction bath",
    ", the desired result would be for the compactivity to take on the same value in both .",
    "however , for a system of two - dimensional disks floated on a frictionless surface and biaxially compacted , it was observed that while @xmath7 measured using either eq .",
    "[ e : specificheat ] or [ e : overlapping2 ] matched either for the subsystem or for the bath , the two values systematically failed to agree between the subsystem and the bath @xcite .",
    "this represents a significant failure of the volume ensemble and compactivity .",
    "tests of the stress ensemble have a shorter history , but the angoricity appears to be more promising as a valid temperature - like quantity . because it is a tensor ( see eq .",
    "[ alpha_def ] ) , it is helpful to calculate it by considering shear ( @xmath93 ) and compressional ( @xmath94 ) components separately .",
    "each of these components gives rise to its own angoricity , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "for example , the shear component ( in a two - dimensional system ) is @xmath97 and the compressional part is @xmath98 , where of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the eigenvalues of the force - moment tensor @xmath75 .",
    "the trace of the force - moment tensor has been commonly referred to as @xmath101 .",

    "this led to the identification of an equation of state : @xmath105 this equation of state was found to be independent of cluster size ( fig .",
    "[ f : tests]b ) , for clusters more than an order of magnitude smaller than were necessary for compactivity measurements .",
    "the slope of the observed line is 1/2 , in agreement with the value predicted from a configurational entropy estimate of @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "a similar technique was applied to packings in experiments @xcite , where the presence of friction requires considering the full tensorial angoricity . a linear equation of state",
    "was observed there as well .",
    "these linear equations of state indicate that the configurational entropy of the packings arises via an `` ideal gas '' of non - interacting local stresses .",
    "a field theoretical model @xcite of the spatial stress fluctuations was developed based on numerical data for frictionless disks , and this has been used to predict the stress fluctuations of numerical and experimental packings under pure shear @xcite .    the generalized edwards ensemble , combining volume and stress as independent factors , was tested in simulations of three - dimensional ( 3d ) frictionless grains  @xcite .",
    "`` thermalization '' was achieved using independently - generated configurations , and results from the ensemble were found to be in agreement with predictions from jamming .",

    "eq . [ partition ] has been treated in the literature .",

    "most statistical treatments of jammed states have relied on some form of decoupling of the volume and stress terms in the partition function .",
    "the original edwards ensemble is an extreme example : the stress fluctuations were not considered at all .",
    "conversely , the force network ensemble ( fne )  @xcite is based on a complete decoupling of the geometric and force degrees of freedom .",
    "it is a microcanonical ensemble that takes a flat measure on all allowed force states for a given ,",

    "the fne decoupling is based on a separation of scales : for infinitely rigid grains or packings of soft grains very close to jamming , small geometric displacements lead to large changes in the interparticle contact forces .",

    "there are many excellent reviews of the application of the fne and we refer the reader to these for a comprehensive discussion @xcite .",
    "another variation on the decoupling theme is to consider a canonical stress ensemble which neglects all volume fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this is the analog of the @xmath123 ensemble of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "it is a reasonable approximation in situations where volume fluctuations are negligible compared to stress fluctuations .",
    "the experimental tests involving both @xmath7 and @xmath69 , described in the previous section , suggest that @xmath69 can be defined even in cases where the definition of @xmath7 is murky . in the remainder of this section , therefore , we focus on the pure stress ensemble ( which includes the fne as a special case ) . the interdependence of volume and stress fluctuations in the generalized ensemble , which is the analog of the @xmath124 ensemble , has received less attention  @xcite .",
    "one of the important questions in this regard is the range of volumes over which jammed packings can be created @xcite .      in 2d , the constraints of local force balance ( eq .",

    "a simpler geometric representation that does not carry information about the real - space geometry ( but retains the topology of the contact network and accurately represents the structure in height - space ) is the tiling picture  @xcite shown in the left panel of fig .  [ ft_example ] .",

    "@xmath135 law requires that the edges of tiles exactly coincide , because each edge ( contact force ) is shared by two grains .",

    "grains with two contact forces or fewer are not represented in a tiling .",
    "we will discuss this aspect in the context of tiling corresponding to frictional grain packings .",
    "a canonical stress ensemble would be defined by @xmath69 and in this ensemble the boundary vectors defining the parallelogram would be allowed to fluctuate . in order to perform an actual calculation , the microscopic probabilities , @xmath32 of each tiling would have to be defined and the additional constraints of torque balance and static friction would have to be imposed on the tilings .",
    "the latter two are irrelevant for frictionless grains , and all calculations ( to date ) of statistical properties of frictionless grains have assumed equiprobability @xmath137 . for frictionless grains , the fne has been used successfully to calculate statistical properties of grains in lattice geometries @xcite .",
    "interestingly , tilings of frictionless grains exhibit an additional extensive quantity that modifies the stress ensemble . in the rest of this section",
    ", we summarize the application of stress ensembles to assemblies of frictionless and frictional grains .      for dry granular solids ,",
    "the forces between grains are purely repulsive . without friction and for disk - shaped particles ,",
    "these contact forces are all central forces .",
    "it can be easily proven that if forces are frictionless and repulsive , all force tiles must strictly be convex in shape .",
    "when all force tiles are convex in shape , they form a planar graph in height space . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ft_example ] , the result is equivalent to the maxwell - cremona reciprocal tiling or force tiling @xcite , where each grain is represented by a polygonal tile .",
    "hence , the area of the parallelogram spanned by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is simply the total area taken up by all tiles in height space @xmath138 where , the last equality holds only in the thermodynamic limit or for periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    ". [ area ] demonstrates that there is an additional extensive quantity for 2d , frictionless assemblies of grains that is distinct from @xmath139 .",
    "while the conservation principle is a prerequisite for the additivity and conservation of @xmath140 , in general , it does not imply so . in the same way as eq .",
    "[ partition ] is derived , a boltzmann term involving the force tile area must also be added to as a result of the area constraint to the microstate probability for frictionless grains : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the area of a microscopic state and @xmath143 for isotropic states , @xmath144 reduces to @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the trace of the force moment tensor .",
    "@xmath146 is proportional to the perimeter of a tile , @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , for a polygon that is convex and isotropic in shape , area is related to perimeter via @xmath148 .",
    "( conversely , anisotropic polygons or complex polygons may have power @xmath149 . ) in this case , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath150 which coincides with the result obtained in a test using fne @xcite and entropy maximization . within the tiling framework , force and pressure distributions",
    "can also be calculated using the fne on a lattice and off - lattice with excellent agreement between theory and monte carlo simulations  @xcite , though the approach remains to be tested on naturally generated packings with coupled forces and geometry .",
    "one particularly interesting result is that the distribution of the magnitude of individual contact forces , @xmath121 is gaussian for packings of frictionless grains  @xcite , and that this is direct consequence of the additional area conservation .",
    "the absence of this additional conservation principle in frictional grains , to be discussed below , raises the intriguing possibility that the exponential form of @xmath121 observed in experiments is connected to force chains and friction .      the tiling framework for frictional grains admits non - convex and even complex ( self - intersecting ) polygons .",
    "[ tiling_frictional ] shows a tiling constructed from experimental data on jammed states created through shear @xcite .",
    "grains located along force chains , where there is a well defined direction of large forces , tend to give rise to self - intersecting polygons , as illustrated in fig . [ tiling_frictional ] .",
    "the additional area conservation is therefore not applicable to tilings of frictional grains , which are non - planar because of the presence of self - intersecting polygons . for frictional grains , therefore , the generalized edwards ensemble encodes all the conservation laws , and there are no additional conserved quantities .",
    "the number @xmath136 of tiles corresponds to grains with more than two contacts . in frictionless grains ,",
    "this number is not far from the actual number of grains .",
    "however , in frictional systems at low densities close to random loose packing , force - bearing grains organize into force - chains that meander through a host of spectator particles that bear essentially no force @xcite . for these systems",
    ", @xmath136 can be very different from the actual number of grains .",
    "what the tiling framework shows is that for mechanical stability , what matters is @xmath136 .",
    "the volume in the original edwards ensemble refers to the volume occupied by _ all _ grains .        in order to perform calculations for frictional grains , assuming equiprobability of microstates , the constraints of torque",
    "balance and static friction would have to be imposed explicitly on the sampling of tiles .",
    "to our knowledge , such a calculation has not been attempted yet .",
    "a meanfield calculation has been performed @xcite and leads to an approximation of the ( force space ) configurational entropy and hence a prediction for the equation of state for grains with friction . in another development",
    ", force tilings constructed from experimental data have been analyzed to demonstrate that emergence of rigidity in shear - jammed solids  @xcite can be related to a persistent pattern in the density of vertices in force tiles @xcite .",
    "there is a clear need for the development of a monte carlo , metropolis algorithm that samples tiling according to the boltzmann - like distribution of the stress ensemble , but which also imposes the constraints of torque balance and the coulomb friction law @xmath151 on the sampling .",
    "the advantage that the tiling framework offers is the ability to encode these constraints in the geometrical language of polygons .",
    "it should be emphasized that sampling tilings is not restricted to a fixed geometry of grains in real space .",
    "what is fixed is the number of force - bearing grains , their positions and contact forces are dynamical variables in a monte carlo scheme , for example .",
    "the positions do not enter the tiling picture explicitly , and an assumption being made in sampling tilings without connecting to the real - space network is that there is real - space network of grains that corresponds to every tiling .",
    "this assumption is reasonable if there is a decoupling of forces and positions , and the indeterminacy arising from tangential forces helps in this regard .",
    "even if numerical calculations are difficult , the tiling framework allows us to construct correlations in height space , which are often more illuminating than real - space correlations  @xcite .",
    "this is because the primary source of correlations in dry granular ensembles are the constraints of mechanical equilibrium , and these are explicitly taken into account in all tiling configurations .      in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "the definition of an equivalent microscopic framework to the two - dimensional tiling becomes much more complex  @xcite . at the continuum level ,",
    "the equivalent to the vector gauge field @xmath152 is a tensor field @xmath153 such that eq .",
    "[ height_defn ] becomes^[note1]^ @xmath154 .",
    "equivalently to the two - dimensional case , we can use stokes theorem to show that the stress in a volume is a boundary term ; the surface integral of @xmath153 dotted with the unit normal . since @xmath153 is a tensor , rather than a vector",
    ", it is unclear what the analogue of the dual tiling space would be ; no 3d equivalent of the tiling has been proposed so far .",
    "recently , @xcite derived a microscopic interpretation of @xmath153 , analogous to the two dimensional height field .",
    "however , while the microscopic variables are vectorial , they only map to @xmath153 by incorporating significant parts of the local geometry . finally , it should be noted that for realistic three dimensional packings gravitation needs to be incorporated , and the framework based on conservation of @xmath14 needs to be extended to include gravity as an external field .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of edwards original ideas was that the dynamics of slowly - driven granular materials can be understood based on the microstate probabilities of jammed states .",
    "this seems plausible if the driving is slow enough that there are rare transitions from one jammed state to another , and the transition probabilities are controlled by properties of the jammed states .",
    "this picture is reminiscent of frameworks constructed for describing the glassy dynamics of thermal systems such as the trap model @xcite , the soft - glassy - dynamics ( sgr ) models @xcite and the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory @xcite . in all of these models , there are transitions into and out of trap - like entities such as free - energy minima .",
    "for example , in the sgr model it is assumed that the material can be partitioned into mesoscopic regions .",
    "each region is able to accommodate some elastic energy and strain .",
    "plastic deformations of the mesoscopic region occur either due to ( i ) global driving or ( ii ) fluctuations due to the elastic energies released by other mesoscopic regions undergoing plastic deformation @xcite . in this meanfield model ,",
    "the latter is represented as an activated process with an effective temperature that is different from the bath temperature @xcite .",
    "a natural avenue of exploration of granular dynamics based on the ensemble ideas is to adopt the same philosophy as sgr , and assume that angoricity plays the role of the effective temperature .",
    "the idea that self - activated processes induced by stress fluctuations , or mechanical noise , influence the rheology of slow granular flows has been explored in the literature @xcite , and it seems reasonable to assume that angoricity determines the strength of this mechanical noise . a angoricity - based",
    ", sgr - like framework has been used to analyze stress fluctuations in laboratory granular couette flows @xcite .",
    "this formalism provides an explanation for the observed logarithmic strengthening @xcite of granular materials .",
    "a key point is that one needs to use a stress ensemble rather than a energy ensemble ( as would be the case for sgr ) , in order to obtain the correct scaling with shear rate .",
    "such applications of the stress ensemble to analyze granular rheology are in their infancy , and much remains to be explored .",
    "our overview of the application of statistical ensemble ideas to athermal , granular materials highlights recent advances in this area .",
    "one of our primary objectives has been to emphasize the similarities and differences between athermal and thermal ensembles .",
    "the experimental and numerical tests discussed in this review illustrate the validity of the ensemble framework in several different contexts .",
    "the equilibration of angoricity , which is the analog of thermalization in the stress ensemble , has been shown to work both in experiments and simulations .",
    "measurements of angoricity and compactivity based on the method of overlapping histograms ( eq . [ e : overlapping2 ] ) , and on fluctuation - response relations such as eq .",
    "[ e : specificheat ] , seem to agree with each other , which suggests that even in these athermal ensembles , fluctuations within a system determine its linear response to driving .",
    "the majority of tests have been performed in 2d , and the applicability of ensembles to 3d packings is much less clear .",
    "equations of state such as those relating the angoricity to the external stress and compactivity to volume have been measured in only a few systems .",
    "in particular , equations of state involving the full tensorial angoricity have remained largely unexplored , as have equations of state relating compactivity and angoricity .",
    "since equiprobability does not seem to be universally valid for jammed systems , equations of state will depend upon the probabilities @xmath32 of the microstates , and these are expected to be sensitive to preparation protocols , friction coefficients and particle shapes .",
    "the variation in equations of states is , therefore , expected to be greater than that found in thermal ensembles .",
    "validity of the ensemble framework , however , narrows down the choice of macrosopic variables that should enter an equation of state .    from the perspective of calculations based on ensembles ,",
    "the difficulty of imposing the constraints of mechanical equilibrium has hindered progress .",
    "in particular , calculations of partition functions have been hampered by two inequality constraints : positivity of forces and the coulomb condition for static friction .",
    "the situation is hopeful in 2d , where the constraints have elegant geometrical representations , but little is know about how to proceed in 3d .    within the context of dynamics",
    ", the ensemble framework provides a natural basis for stress - induced fluctuations being represented by a type of thermal noise .",
    "the rheology of slowly driven systems could potentially be completely linked to angoricity and compactivity by generalizing the idea of thermally activated processes to stress - activated processes that lead to plastic failure .",
    "if dynamics can be related to `` granular equilibrium '' concepts such as angoricity and compactivity , that would be a big step since granular rheology could then be related to stresses imposed at the boundaries .    to summarize ,",
    "the last decade has seen much progress in testing and establishing the generalized edwards ensemble , which establishes the laws of granular equilibrium .",
    "we should emphasize that the ensemble framework is relevant only to static and slowly - driven granular materials where the kinetic energy of the grains do not play a significant role .",
