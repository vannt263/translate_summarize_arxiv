    "the intense xfel pulses provide enough signal to reconstruct molecular structures from nano - sized crystals and even from non - crystalline single particles  @xcite . in crystallography , elastic x - ray scattering signals from crystals coherently interfere , thus yielding bragg peaks , while compton scattering gives rise to a background signal . in single - particle imaging experiments , however , compton scattering signals are not distinguishable from the elastic x - ray scattering signals , unless the photon detector can resolve compton energy shifts .",

    "the deviation due to the waller - hartree approximation will be discussed later .",

    "then the outgoing photon energy is simply given by @xmath75    we assume that the free electron is described by a plane wave state .",
    "with this assumption , the summation over @xmath47 in eq .   is converted into an integral over @xmath63 , and the summation over @xmath46 into an integral over @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "the ddscs then goes over into @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given in eq .   as a function of @xmath62 , and @xmath78",
    "is the initial momentum distribution .",
    "let us assume that the angular distribution of the ionized electron with a given kinetic energy @xmath7 is isotropic , @xmath79 where the kinetic energy @xmath7 is determined by the photoionization or auger ( coster - kronig ) decay process that has produced the free electron . with this isotropic @xmath78 , the integral over @xmath62 in eq .",
    "is readily evaluated as @xmath80 for a range of @xmath15 that is given by eq .",

    "eqs .   and ] .",
    "the compton shift is proportional to @xmath86 and the doppler shift is proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "also note that the compton shift is always a redshift ( a down shift in energy ) , whereas the doppler shift shows both blueshift and redshift ( up and down shifts in energy ) .",
    "therefore , the waller - hartree approximation employed here has to be reconsidered when high - energy x - ray photons and high - energy free electrons are involved . for example , x - rays with a photon energy of 10  kev could make a compton shift of @xmath19400  ev . if x - rays with the same incident photon energy are scattered by free electrons with a kinetic energy of 5  kev , then they could make a doppler shift of 2.8  kev .    to test the validity of the waller - hartree approximation",
    ", we numerically solve @xmath15 in eq .   without the approximation as follows .",
    "equation   represents a nonlinear equation for @xmath15 because @xmath89 on the right - hand side contains @xmath15 via eqs .   and without the approximation .",
    "let us consider the following coupled equations from eqs .  , , and in an iterative way :",
    "@xmath90 at the @xmath91th step , @xmath92 is calculated using @xmath93 from the previous step , and then @xmath94 is calculated using @xmath92 , and so on .",
    "this iterative procedure starts with eq .   for @xmath95 , which is the solution employing the waller - hartree approximation , and repeats until @xmath15 is converged .",
    "for the above example ( @xmath87=10  kev and @xmath7=5  kev ) , the converged results in this case show deviations less than 8% from those obtained from the waller - hartree approximation .",
    "shows the compton spectra for two free electrons with kinetic energies of 2  kev and 5  kev , respectively , interacting with 10-kev x - rays .",
    "all calculations are done with the waller - hartree approximation . due to the doppler shift by free electrons with arbitrary directions ,",
    "the shift in @xmath15 can be negative ( redshift ) for @xmath96 or positive ( blueshift ) for @xmath97 . because of the high electron kinetic energies assumed , the shifts are quite large and the compton spectra are spread out over a broad range . for the 5-kev case , the shifts become @xmath98 times larger than for the 2-kev case , but",
    "the height is reduced accordingly . note that the energy - integrated compton spectrum on the right panel gives 2@xmath99 from two free electrons , showing no dependence on the scattering angle .",

    "number of computed and searched values in a sequence of the bessel range function calls . ]",
    "histogram of search steps used in the bessel range function calculations . ]    the overall runtime for the ddscs calculations of a heavy atom like xe is dominated by evaluations of the bessel functions .",
    "we implement an efficient scheme to evaluate the spherical bessel function of the @xmath100-type  @xcite in a fortran-90 function .",
    "the code is based on the mathematical work by lentz  @xcite . in the following we just call it the bessel function . since we need the evaluation of the bessel function for different @xmath101 from 0 to @xmath102 and @xmath103 from 0 to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 on a radial grid , we code this functionality in the so called bessel range function .",
    "the bessel range function calls the bessel function for actual computations , but at the same time it avoids to do so if an interpolation between two already computed bessel values is possible .    here",
    "we describe how our implementation works in detail by showing the following three figures .",
    "these figures are based on a single ddscs calculation of the neutral ground - state xe atom at an incoming photon energy of 10  kev , with 18 different scattering angles , @xmath106 , outgoing photon energies from 7 to 10  kev , an energy step of 10  ev , and 90,000 points on the uniform radial grid ( @xmath107  a.u . ) for the electron continuum states .",
    "the same parameters are used in the compton spectra calculations of ar and xe in the results ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , except for 181 scattering angular points to get better angular resolution .",
    "in we plot the argument range at the @xmath108-th call to the bessel range function . for the first 18",
    "calls the argument range ramps up , and it increases in a similar fashion for the next calls . such block with 18 calls corresponds to the 18 different scattering angles at fixed outgoing photon energy .",
    "so it is possible to compute spherical bessel functions only up to a maximum argument , to store arguments and results in a table , and then to search an argument in the table and perform a linear interpolation to obtain a resulting bessel value .",
    "that means that actual computing is necessary only for a very small fraction of calls , which is illustrated in .",
    "plots the number of computed and searched values in a sequence of the bessel range function calls .",
    "it shows that only the first ramp in includes computation of spherical bessel functions . in the first ramp",
    ", we apply the optimization scheme as follows . at the first call to the bessel range function ,",
    "one computes every single function value . in all the following calls ,",
    "one looks up the argument and interpolates until it does not fall into the previous range anymore , and then one has to actually compute a value .    as shown in ,",
    "most of the time may be used for searching , rather than actual computation of the bessel function .",
    "thus , the searching algorithm is another key to optimize this calculation procedure . a general purpose method such as the binary search algorithm would give a computation complexity of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the number of data .",
    "in our case we have accumulated a table of 394,037 values , which would lead to about 19 search steps on average by using the binary search algorithm .",
    "shows a histogram of search steps in our simulation .",
    "our searching algorithm exploits that the bessel function arguments to be searched are in ascending order .",
    "therefore , it requires very often only two search steps , and about 4 steps on average .    with this overall optimization scheme we can achieve about 8 times faster calculations than those previously used in compton scattering calculations  @xcite .",
    "the runtime on a single cpu ( intel xeon e5 - 2609 ) is reduced from 27h 6min to 3h 18min , for a ddscs calculation of the neutral ground - state xe atom with 181 scattering angular points .",
    "the results before and after optimization are identical to within 0.1% difference .",
    "also it is worthwhile to note that the new bessel function routine can handle a very high @xmath101 @xmath111 , so it can accommodate a very high energy regime .",
    "the more extreme the parameters get , the bigger are the advantages of our optimization .",

    "in this paper , we have presented theoretical results for the compton spectra of atoms at high x - ray intensity . interacting with intense x - ray pulses , an atomic system undergoes massive ionization , described by sequential multiphoton ionization dynamics .",
    "therefore a single atom produces a large number of free electrons and becomes a highly charged ion .",
    "in contrast to the low x - ray intensity regime , where compton scattering from bound electrons in neutral atoms is only considered , it is necessary in the high x - ray intensity regime to include the compton scattering contributions from bound electrons in ions and from free electrons .",
    "we have demonstrated that compton spectra at high x - ray intensity are considerably deformed from those of neutral atoms , because of the contributions from ions and free electrons . due to individual ion contributions ,",
    "characteristic peak structures of the compton spectra are smoothed out . as a consequence of large contributions from free electrons ,",
    "the scattering signals exhibit not only a redshift but also a blueshift .",
    "the effect becomes drastic as the x - ray fluence increases beyond the one - photon absorption saturation fluence , and it becomes more severe when a heavier atom is considered . in order to make the compton spectra calculations for heavy atoms feasible , we have introduced a simplified expression for bound electrons and proposed an efficient way to calculate spherical bessel functions extensively used in the compton calculations .",
    "these present implementations have been incorporated into the extended xatom toolkit .",
    "xatom augmented with compton scattering enables us to investigate elastic and inelastic scattering dynamics on the same footing , including severe radiation damage when the sample is exposed to intense xfel pulses .",
