    "it goes without saying that the recent observation of a higgs boson with mass around 126gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and determination of the neutrino - mixing parameter @xmath1 at neutrino - oscillation experiments  @xcite constitute crucial guideposts for attempts to establish the nature of physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "another factor that any realistic scenario for new physics would need to explain is that about a quarter of the cosmic energy budget has been inferred from astronomical observations to be attributable to dark matter  @xcite .",
    "one of the most economical possibilities accommodating the essential ingredients is the scotogenic model invented by ma  @xcite , in which neutrinos get mass radiatively via one - loop interactions with nonstandard particles consisting of scalars and fermions , at least one of which acts as dark matter  ( dm ) .",
    "previously , within the context of this model we have addressed  @xcite some of the implications of the aforementioned experimental findings , specifically the decays of the higgs boson @xmath2 into final states containing the new particles , assuming the lightest one of them to be fermionic cold dm .",
    "taking into account various experimental and theoretical constraints , we found that such exotic decays of @xmath2 could have significant rates that were already probed by existing lhc data and that the scotogenic effects on @xmath3 would be testable in upcoming measurements . in the present paper , we look at additional tests on this scenario of the model using @xmath0 colliders , motivated in part by the availability of good amounts of past data from lepii  @xcite that are potentially pertinent to our parameter space of interest and in part by the increasing prospect of the international linear collider  ( ilc ) being realized in the foreseeable future  @xcite .    the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "in the next section , we first describe the relevant lagrangians for the nonstandard particles in the model and the expressions related to the neutrino masses .",
    "subsequently , adopting the particle data group ( pdg ) parametrization of the neutrino - mixing matrix , we derive exact solutions for the yukawa couplings of the new particles in terms of only three free parameters .",
    "we will pick one set of such solutions to be used in our numerical work . in  section  [ constraints ] , we briefly review the main restraints on the parameter space under consideration and also employ the planck data on the dm relic abundance to update the allowed ranges of the yukawa coupling belonging to the dm candidate . in  section  [ colliders ] , with the parameter values satisfying the constraints listed earlier , we investigate the scotogenic effects on the higgs boson decay , taking into account other restrictions from the latest lhc data .",
    "moreover , we explore complementary and further tests on the model from past measurements on @xmath0 collisions at lepii . in particular",
    ", we show that the lepii data on @xmath0 scattering into a pair of charged leptons plus missing energy can impose potentially important extra constraints , much more so than the data on @xmath0 colliding into a  photon plus missing energy .",
    "nevertheless , we also find that experiments on the two types of @xmath0 scattering processes at the future ilc can supply complementary results useful for probing the model .",
    "we give our conclusions in  section  [ summary ] . some additional information and lengthy formulas",
    "are collected in a  couple of appendixes .",
    "in the simplest version of the scotogenic model  @xcite , the components beyond the minimal sm are a  scalar doublet ,  @xmath4 , and three singlet majorana fermions , @xmath5 , all of which are odd under an  exactly conserved @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "all of the sm particles are @xmath6 even .",
    "it follows that the lightest one of the nonstandard particles is stable and can serve as  dm .",
    "here we suppose that @xmath7 is a good candidate for cold  dm .",
    "the lagrangian responsible for the interactions of the scalar particles in this model with one another and with the gauge bosons is @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the usual covariant derivative containing the sm gauge fields , the potential  @xcite @xmath10 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , after electroweak symmetry breaking , @xmath11 with @xmath2 being the physical higgs boson and @xmath12 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath6 symmetry implies that the vev of @xmath4 is zero .",
    "the masses of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are then given by @xmath17 we work under the assumption that @xmath18 is very small  @xcite , @xmath19 , implying that @xmath20 are nearly degenerate , @xmath21 .",
    "in @xmath22 , the part that includes the couplings of @xmath4 to @xmath2 , the photon  @xmath23 , and the @xmath24 boson is @xmath25 \\frac{h}{v } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; i e\\,\\bigl(h^+\\,\\partial^\\rho h^--h^-\\,\\partial^\\rho h^+\\bigr ) a_\\rho^ { } \\,+\\ , e^2\\,h^+h^- a^2 \\,+\\ , \\frac{e g}{c_{\\rm w}}\\bigl(1 - 2s_{\\rm w}^2\\bigr)\\,h^+h^- a^\\rho z_\\rho^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\ ; \\frac{g}{2c_{\\rm w } } \\bigl [ { \\cal p}\\,\\partial^\\rho{\\cal s}-{\\cal s}\\,\\partial^\\rho{\\cal p } \\,+\\ , i\\bigl(1 - 2s_{\\rm w}^2\\bigr ) \\bigl(h^+\\,\\partial^\\rho h^--h^-\\,\\partial^\\rho",

    "a recent analysis of global neutrino - oscillation data yields  @xcite @xmath49    upon applying eq.([u ] ) in eq.([umu ] ) , we arrive at the relations @xmath50 explicitly , @xmath51 the diagonalization conditions in eq.([numass ] ) turn out to be exactly solvable for two of the three elements @xmath52 with the same @xmath53 in terms of the third one , in which case the @xmath54 matrix has only three free ( complex ) parameters .",
    "we opt for getting @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of @xmath57 . as outlined in appendix[yjk ] , there is more than one set of the solutions , but not all of the sets fulfill the requirement that at least two of the mass eigenvalues @xmath58 be nonzero .",
    "one of the solution sets that can supply three nonzero masses of the neutrinos comprises @xmath59 which correspond to the mass eigenvalues @xmath60 the necessity that @xmath58 be real and nonnegative then implies that @xmath61 in the rest of the paper , we utilize eqs.([123 ] ) and ( [ m1m2m3 ] ) , and for simplicity we set @xmath62 , in accord with the empirical range of @xmath63 in  eq.([xranges ] ) . also , we take @xmath64 to be real and nonnegative .",
    "now , in our previous study we adopted a simpler form of @xmath42 which depends on only two angles , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and has no phases  @xcite .",
    "it can be reproduced from @xmath67 in eq.([u ] ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 . moreover , numerically we chose for definiteness @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which led to @xmath39 elements in agreement at the one - sigma level with their experimental values in  eq.([xranges ] ) .",
    "hence , in the present analysis we adopt for @xmath67 the same numerical input . according to eq.([sc ] ) , this translates into @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and  @xmath76 , consistent with eq.([xranges ] ) and leading to the neutrino eigenmasses would be modified with a  tribimaximal form  @xcite of the mixing matrix @xmath39 , which corresponds to @xmath77 and is therefore no longer compatible with the current data  @xcite . applying this to eq.([m1m2m3 ] ) , with zero phases , yields @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath79 value is very different from that in eq.([m123 ] ) . ]",
    "as we discussed in ref.@xcite , there are a number of theoretical and experimental restrictions on the couplings and masses of the nonstandard particles in the scotogenic scenario being examined .",
    "we found specifically that the strictest limitations on the yukawa couplings @xmath81 come from the data on the neutrino squared - mass differences @xmath82 , the empirical bounds on the branching ratios of the charged - lepton flavor - changing radiative decays @xmath83 , and the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter space of interest in this study is subject to the same restraints from low - energy experiments .    also important",
    "are constraints on @xmath85 from the observed dm relic abundance , @xmath86 , as we have selected @xmath7 to be the lightest of the nonstandard particles and play the role of cold  dm .",
    "the dominant contributions to @xmath86 arise from the @xmath7 annihilations into @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are induced at tree level by @xmath89 and @xmath16 exchanges , respectively .",
    "each of them involves diagrams in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 channels because of the majorana nature of the external neutral fermions . in ref.@xcite",
    "we derived the amplitudes for @xmath92 and computed the corresponding annihilation rate in order to extract the values of @xmath93 consistent with the @xmath86 data supplied by the pdg .",
    "here we update the allowed ranges of @xmath93 by demanding it to satisfy instead @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the hubble constant .",
    "this is the 90%-confidence - level range of @xmath96 which was determined by the planck collaboration  @xcite from the planck measurement and other data .",
    "we display in fig.[y1plots](a ) some examples of the resulting @xmath93 over @xmath97gev for the solutions in eq.([123 ] ) and different sets of @xmath41 and @xmath98 .",
    "the allowed ranges of @xmath93 in this plot are narrower than those found in ref.@xcite using the less precise pdg number for  @xmath86 . in fig.[y1plots](b ) we present examples for a  larger range of @xmath99 which may be probed at high - energy electron - positron colliders . more details on the various constraints mentioned only briefly in this section are available in ref.@xcite .     over two different ranges of @xmath7 mass , @xmath99 , fulfilling the relic density requirement for some selections of the new neutral and changed scalars masses @xmath100.[y1plots],title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]   over two different ranges of @xmath7 mass , @xmath99 , fulfilling the relic density requirement for some selections of the new neutral and changed scalars masses @xmath100.[y1plots],title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]",
    "for the @xmath99 range shown in fig.[y1plots](a ) , the appropriate values of @xmath102 , and sufficiently low masses of the new scalars , @xmath103 , the higgs boson @xmath2 may decay into final states involving the nonstandard particles . in ref.@xcite , we considered such decays which proceed from tree - level diagrams , namely @xmath104 or @xmath105 , depending on the daughter particles masses , over the regions @xmath106gev and @xmath107gev .",
    "as we found previously , these exotic decay channels are allowed to have enhanced rates by the constraints described in the preceding section , including the updated one from the planck data .",
    "we list several instances of this in the tenth column of table[numbers ] for different sets of the mass parameters @xmath103 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 . for this table , we have employed the higgs mass @xmath110gev , compatible with the latest measurements  @xcite , and the sm higgs total width  @xmath111mev  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath112 involves the combined rate @xmath113 of all of the kinematically permitted exotic modes mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "the two numbers on each line under @xmath114 correspond to the two different numbers on the same line in the @xmath108 column , which includes the possibility that @xmath115 can be negative  @xcite . in the last four rows ,",
    "@xmath116 because these exotic decays of the higgs can not happen for the large mass choices .",
    "the last two columns in table[numbers ] illustrate the impact of the new particles on the standard decay channels @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "these decays are of great interest because they arise from loop diagrams and hence are sensitive to possible new - physics contributions , which are @xmath16 in our case .",
    "furthermore , these channels are already under investigation at the lhc  @xcite . the ratios @xmath119 for @xmath120 would thus signal new physics if they are unambiguously measured to deviate from unity .",

    "we have investigated the possibility of employing @xmath0 colliders to provide additional tests on the scotogenic model of radiative neutrino mass .",
    "this study continues our previous work which addressed the higgs boson undergoing exotic decays into the nonstandard particles of the same model . unlike before , here we adopt the pdg parametrization of the neutrino - mixing matrix and derive exact solutions for the yukawa couplings of the new particles in terms of three free ( complex ) parameters .",
    "accordingly , the yukawa results are consistent with the measured elements of the mixing matrix .",
    "we select one set of such solutions to be used in our numerical computation . as before",
    ", we assume that the lightest one of the new fermions is the cold dm candidate .",
    "then , taking into account various theoretical and experimental constraints , including those from low - energy measurements and the planck data on the relic dm density , we scan the model parameter space for regions that can accommodate the higgs exotic decays and also masses of the new particles that can be produced at @xmath0 colliders . at present the lhc",
    "higgs data do not yet translate into severe restrictions on the allowed parameter values .",
    "subsequently , we consider constraints on them from past measurements at lepii on @xmath0 collisions into a pair of charged leptons plus missing energy and into a  photon plus missing energy . these processes , respectively ,",
    "receive contributions from the scotogenic reactions @xmath125 and @xmath126 followed by the ( sequential ) decays of @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 into the dm particle @xmath7 plus light leptons .",
    "we show that the @xmath129 channel is subject to strict extra limitations from the lepii data , whereas the neutral channels are  not . finally , we turn to the possibility of measuring the same @xmath0 scattering processes with higher energies and much improved precision at a future facility , in particular the ilc .",
    "we find that at the ilc such experiments can be expected to offer complementary information for probing the scotogenic model more extensively .",
