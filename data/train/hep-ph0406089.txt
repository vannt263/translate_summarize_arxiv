    "recent discovery of cp violation in the neutral @xmath6-meson system @xcite is in perfect accord with the cp violation observed in @xmath7 mesons @xcite .",
    "both results are explained within the minimal model of cp violation , known as the kobayashi - maskawa model @xcite .",
    "it links cp - violation in @xmath7 and @xmath6 mesons to a single cp - violating invariant of the kobayashi - maskawa matrix in the quark sector , im@xmath8 .",
    "this combination , as well as @xmath9 , are the only sources of cp violation in the standard model .",
    "an independent piece of experimental information about cp violation comes from the searches of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of neutrons @xcite and heavy atoms @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the kobayashi - maskawa model predicts extremely small edms .",
    "indeed , the necessity of four electroweak vertices requires from any diagram capable of inducing an edm of a quark to have at least two loops .",
    "moreover , it turns out that all edms or color edms of quarks vanish exactly at the two - loop level @xcite , and only three - loop diagrams survive @xcite , producing a tiny number of order @xmath10 cm .",
    "the only relevant operator that is not zero at the two - loop order is the weinberg operator @xcite , but its numerical value turns out to be also extremely small .",
    "possible enhancement comes from the large distance effects , that could lead to a km - generated edm of the neutron of order @xmath11 cm @xcite , which is still six to seven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental limit .",
    "the km phase in the quark sector induces the edm of a lepton via a diagram with a closed quark loop , but a non - vanishing result appears first at a four - loop level @xcite and therefore is even more suppressed .",
    "the suppressed values of edms from the km model together with enormous accuracy of edm experiments produce stringent constraints on possible flavour - diagonal sources of cp violation , notably on cp - odd combinations of the soft - breaking parameters in the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the km phase can not be the only source of cp violation in nature .",
    "dynamical generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) requires presence of an additional source(s ) of cp violation in nature .",
    "one of the most appealing scenarios for bau is leptogenesis @xcite where a non - zero lepton number is generated from the out - of - equilibrium decay of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos with cp violation coming from the yukawa sector of the theory .",
    "subsequent sphaleron transitions @xcite transform half of the initial lepton asymmetry into bau .",
    "the attractiveness of leptogenesis is in its simplicity , relative freedom from the low - energy constraints , and in recent experimental results that indicate large mixing angles in the lepton sector @xcite .",
    "the complex phases in the lepton mixing suggested by leptogenesis at some level will induce @xmath12 , the electron edm , as well as edms of other charged leptons .",
    "various calculations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 were performed in the supersymmetric case under certain assumption about the soft - breaking parameters @xcite , while a non - supersymmetric case remains poorly explored .",
    "we note that manifestations of majorana phases in cp - violating phenomena has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the edm is an additional observable arising due to those phases . compared with the km model , where three generations and at least four loops are necessary to generate a lepton edm",
    ", the addition of majorana phases enhances the effect .",
    "however , as we will see , it remains very small .    in this paper",
    ", we present a systematic analysis of the two - loop diagrams that lead to the edms of charged leptons through interactions with two additional heavy neutrinos , in a one - generation model suggested by a minimal leptogenesis scenario .",
    "these diagrams can be divided into two major classes .",
    "the first class where the lepton number is conserved along the fermion line vanishes identically , as the same arguments that lead to @xmath14 at two loops @xcite apply ( see fig .",
    "[ figdirac ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we find that two - loop diagrams give non - vanishing results for the @xmath12 .",
    "however , edms are very much suppressed by the smallness of the neutrino mass as they first appear in @xmath15 order , if the see - saw type relation between @xmath3 , dirac mass and heavy majorana mass is imposed .",
    "thus , for any phenomenologically motivated choice of @xmath3 the result for @xmath12 ( and @xmath13 ) turns out to be much smaller than current or projected experimental sensitivity to edms .",
    "we also note that the fine - tuning in the neutrino mass sector may lead to up to ten orders of magnitude enhancement in @xmath12 , which is still not enough to bring it within the experimental reach in the near future .",
    "we take one standard model generation : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and two singlet heavy neutrinos @xmath18 .",
    "the latter do not participate in electroweak interactions ; in particular , the charged current sector is described by the lagrangian _",

    "@xmath56 there is an additional possibility of @xmath57 and @xmath43 both being light .",

    "[ fnum ] not only is this number much smaller than the most optimistic accuracy of future electron edm searches @xcite , but also it is significantly smaller than edms induced by the km phase from the quark sector .",
    "the fine - tuned case deserves special consideration , as the numerical answer for @xmath12 can be significantly larger than ( [ fnum ] ) . introducing another angle @xmath62 , which has to be small for the fine - tuning of @xmath3 to happen , we rewrite the light neutrino mass squared as m_^2 = ( ( m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)^2 + 4m_1 ^ 2m_2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ) .",

    "the latter follows from the condition that yukawa sector remains perturbative , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 . comparing ( [ seesawbound ] ) and ( [ anotherbound ] )",
    ", we observe that the fine - tuned case may lead to up to @xmath66 enhancement relative to the see - saw case and the electron edm may reach a value of d_e 10 ^ -33  e  cm ,   finetuned   case .",
    "[ maximal ] this value is still far from the existing or projected experimental accuracy but is much larger than the electron edm induced by the km phase .    in some models",
    "the effects of the cp - odd electron - nucleon interaction , @xmath67 may dominate over the electron edm contribution @xcite in the atomic ( molecular ) edm .",
    "an analysis of possible two - loop diagrams for @xmath68 shows that in the model with cp violation coming from majorana neutrinos this is not the case , and the contribution of @xmath69 to atomic edm is smaller than ( [ fnum ] ) for the see - saw case and ( [ maximal ] ) for the fine - tuned case .",
    "to summarize , we have calculated the contributions of the two - loop diagrams to the edm of the electron in non - supersymmetric models with cp violation in the lepton sector and with majorana masses for neutrinos .",
    "we notice that the non - zero result for @xmath12 can be obtained in a rather minimalistic way : with one generation of sm leptons and two right - handed neutrinos . in terms of the right - handed mass @xmath70 and dirac mass @xmath71",
    ", the non - zero result appears in order @xmath72 , which is the largest possible result given the symmetries of the model . if the smallness of the light neutrino mass is achieved via usual see - saw relation without any fine - tuning , this answer is equivalent to @xmath15 and numerically is extremely small .",
    "numerical smallness of this result stems from the smallness of @xmath3 , and the parametric suppression of edm is very similar to the suppression of _",
    "e.g. _ the sm amplitude for @xmath73 decay . in the fine - tuned case , when the smallness of the light neutrino mass is achieved via near perfect cancellation of two contributions , the result for @xmath12 may become larger by many orders of magnitude , but still smaller than about @xmath74 cm , and therefore much smaller than the sensitivity of any edm experiment in the foreseeable future .",
    "we conclude that the km - type models with majorana neutrino masses do not have any impact on the edm searches .",
    "therefore , the only options of searching for cp - violation in the neutrino sector suggested by the leptogenesis scenario are the cp asymmetries in neutrino oscillations and not edms .",
    "conversely , possible positive results from the future electron edm searches could be an indication of leptogenesis combined with the soft supersymmetry breaking .",
