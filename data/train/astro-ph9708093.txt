    "it is commonly believed that the observed solar and stellar variabilities have their origin in the hydromagnetic dynamos associated with turbulent convection zones .",
    "numerical studies have been made using the full magneto - hydrodynamical partial differential equations ( pde ) , which reproduce some features of solar and stellar dynamos ( e.g. gilman 1983 ) .",
    "such models are fairly complex and do not allow extensive parameter surveys . as a result , a number of alternatives to the direct integration of pde have been pursued . among these",
    "has been the employment of the mean field dynamo formalism ( krause & rdler 1980 ) in order to construct various types of dynamos , such as @xmath2 dynamo models . despite the fact that such models have been shown to be capable of producing a large number of observationally relevant modes of behaviour , ranging from stationary to chaotic ( c.f .",
    "brandenburg et al .",
    "1989a , b ; tavakol et al .",
    "1995 ) , they nevertheless involve a number of unknown features such as the exact nature of the nonlinearities involved .",
    "furthermore , in order to clarify the origin of dynamical modes of behaviour observed in dynamo models , further simplifications of these models have been considered , involving low dimensional truncations of the governing pde .",
    "such models have also been shown to be capable of producing a number of important features of stellar variability including periodic , intermittent and chaotic modes of behaviour ( zeldovich et al .",
    "1983 ; weiss et al .",
    "1984 ; feudel et al . 1993 ) .",
    "now given that these models are cheaper to integrate and more transparent to study , it would be very useful if we could employ them as diagnostic tools in order to study the effects of introducing different parametrisations and nonlinearities involved .",
    "the problem , however , is that these low dimensional models involve severe approximations , and therefore in order to be able to take the results produced by them as physically relevant , it is important that they remain robust under changes which fall within the domain of the approximations assumed .",
    "this is particularly of importance since on the basis of results from dynamical systems theory , structurally stable systems are not everywhere dense in the space of dynamical systems ( smale 1966 ) , in the sense that small changes in models can produce qualitatively important changes in their dynamics . in this way",
    "the appropriate theoretical framework for the construction of mathematical models and the analysis of observational data may turn out to be that of structural fragility ( tavakol & ellis 1988 ; coley & tavakol 1992 ; tavakol et al .",
    "1995 ) .    here as examples of such changes",
    "we shall consider first changes in the order of truncation and then changes in the details of the physics assumed . regarding the former , a number of attempts have already been made to study the effects of increasing the truncation order on the resulting dynamics .",
    "for example , schmalz & stix ( 1991 ) ( hereafter referred to as s&s91 ) have looked at the detailed dynamics of the low dimensional truncations of the mean field dynamo equations and have studied what happens as the order of the truncation is increased , while tobias et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have employed normal form theory to construct a robust minimal third order model which exhibits both the modulation of basic cycles and chaos .",
    "these studies have shown that low dimensional models can capture a number of important dynamical features of the dynamo models .",
    "our aim in this paper is complementary to that of the above authors .",
    "we take a detailed look at the results in s&s91 and ask to what extent these results remain robust as reasonable changes are made to the details of the physics employed , and in each case we study how such changes affect the dynamical behaviour of different truncations .",
    "the starting point of the truncated dynamical @xmath1 models considered in s&s91 is the mean field induction equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mean magnetic field and the mean velocity , respectively .",
    "the turbulent magnetic diffusitivity @xmath6 and the coefficient @xmath1 , which relates the mean electrical current arising in helical turbulence ( the @xmath1effect ) to the mean magnetic field , both arise from the correlation of small scale ( turbulent ) velocity and magnetic fields ( krause & rdler 1980 ) .",
    "s&s91 employ an axisymmetrical configuration with one spatial dimension @xmath7 , which corresponds to a latitude coordinate and a longitudinal velocity with a constant radial gradient ( the vertical shear @xmath8 ) .",
    "the magnetic field takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11component ( latitudinal ) of the magnetic vector potential , @xmath12 the @xmath11component of @xmath4 and @xmath7 is measured in terms of the stellar radius @xmath13 .",
    "these assumptions allow eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) to be split into @xmath14 in s&s91 , @xmath1 is divided into a static ( kinematic ) and a dynamic ( magnetic ) part : @xmath15 , with its time - dependent part @xmath16 satisfying an evolution equation in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a damping operator and @xmath19 is a pseudo - scalar that is quadratic in the magnetic filed .    it has been argued that the @xmath1 effect is quenched by the current helicity density @xmath20 , which in turn is governed by a dynamical equation ( kleeorin & ruzmaikin 1982 ; zeldovich et al .",
    "the reason the feedback ( quenching ) is not instantaneous is a consequence of the fact that the magnetic helicity is conserved in the absence of diffusion or boundary effects .",
    "such models have been investigated recently by kleeorin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in s&s91 a truncated version of yet another model was studied , in which instead of the current helicity density , the magnetic helicity density @xmath21 , or rather @xmath22 , was used .",
    "their model was motivated on heuristic grounds .",
    "bifurcation properties of a truncated version of a similar model , but with a different damping term , have been studied by feudel et al . (",
    "our present investigation is thus motivated partially by the variety of models presented in the literature .",
    "it is important to know what is the effect of the dynamical feedback and how the different representations affect the results .    to proceed s&s91 specify the feedback in the following way @xmath23 and then look at various @xmath24modal truncations of these equations and study what happens to the dynamical behaviour of the resulting systems as @xmath25 is increased .    to do this it is convenient to transform these equations into a non - dimensional form",
    "this can be done by employing a reference field @xmath26 , measuring time in units of @xmath27 and defining the following non - dimensional quantities @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the turbulent diffusivity",
    ". equations ( [ p1 ] ) , ( [ p2 ] ) and ( [ dynamicalpha ] ) with the damping operator taken to be @xmath30 can then be rewritten in the following non - dimensional forms : @xmath31 now considering the interval @xmath32 ( which corresponds to the full range of latitudes ) , taking the boundary conditions at @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be given by @xmath35 and using a spectral expansion of the form @xmath36 allows the set of eqs .",
    "( [ 1][3 ] ) to be transformed into the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 if @xmath39 is odd and @xmath40 otherwise and @xmath41 if @xmath42 is odd and @xmath43 otherwise .",
    "these rules enable the system to describe fields which are strictly symmetric ( i.e. having only components @xmath44 with odd @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 with even @xmath45 ) or strictly antisymmetric ( i.e. having only components @xmath46 with odd @xmath45 and @xmath44 and @xmath47 with even @xmath45 ) with respect to @xmath48 , provided the initial conditions have either of these parities .    using these equations ,",
    "s&s91 studied a number of such truncations numerically by varying the dynamo number @xmath49 at each truncation @xmath25 .",
    "their main conclusions were :    1 .   with the choice of the driving term @xmath50 given by eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) the antisymmetric truncation with the smallest non - trivial indices is identical with the lorenz system ( lorenz 1963 ) .",
    "2 .   different truncations are capable of producing stationary , oscillatory and chaotic modes of behaviour .",
    "they also make observations about the changes in the route to chaos , and conclude that , as @xmath25 is increased , the route changes from period doubling to the ruelle ",
    "takens  newhouse scenario ( ruelle & takens 1971 ; newhouse et al .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the truncations stabilises as the number of modes is increased and in particular for @xmath51 . as an example",
    "they observe that as @xmath25 is increased the limit cycles remain stable for larger dynamo numbers .",
    "they also discuss very briefly the @xmath52 case , observing that the @xmath53 case is always a stable fixed point and that for @xmath54 the antisymmetric limit cycle becomes unstable via a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "now , as mentioned above , there are arguments in support of both the form of the driving term as well as the damping term being different ( kleeorin et al .",

    "this amounts to the expectation that @xmath1 relaxes much more slowly than the magnetic field . ] .",
    "since our aim is to study the qualitative effects brought about by the changes in the form of @xmath50 , we will not delve deeply into the details of the dynamics , such as the routes to chaos , and concentrate instead on the occurrence of equilibrium , periodic ( including quasiperiodic ) and chaotic regimes .",
    "accordingly , the tools we employ are the time series and the spectra of lyapunov exponents .",
    "the latter is particularly useful as a relatively sensitive tool to characterise the dynamics , with the lyapunov spectra of the types @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 corresponding to equilibrium , periodic , quasiperiodic ( with two periods ) and chaotic regimes respectively . also to keep the numerical costs reasonable ,",
    "the resolution of @xmath49 in all the figures was , unless stated otherwise , taken to be @xmath84 .",

    "we note also that the @xmath2 dynamo concept becomes invalid if @xmath49 exceeds a certain limit ( choudhuri 1990 ) .",
    "furthermore , in general , as @xmath49 is increased more modes ( higher @xmath25 ) are required to achieve convergence ( numerically bounded solutions ) .      for the sake of comparison with s&s91",

    "the largest lyapunov exponent is depicted by a solid line and its negative , zero and positive values indicate equilibrium , periodic and chaotic regimes .",
    "the simultaneous vanishing of the second lyapunov exponent would imply the presence of quasiperiodic motion with two frequencies ( i.e. motion on a 2torus ) .",
