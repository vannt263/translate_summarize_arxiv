    "all known elementary particles belong to one of the two fundamentally different types : bosons and fermions .",
    "the unification of these two types of particles is one of the most fundamental issues in elementary - particle physics .",
    "the best known theoretical principle for the unification of bosons and fermions is _ supersymmetry _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , supersymmetric field theories are invariant with respect to a transformation that mixes bosonic and fermionic _",
    "fields_. nevertheless , in field theories ,",
    "each particle species is described by a different field .",
    "consequently , in supersymmetric field theories , bosonic and fermionic fields are still different fields .",
    "some supersymmetric field theories ( typically , theories with only one supersymmetric charge ) can be formulated in terms of superfields that describe both bosonic and fermionic fields as parts of a single superfield , but a superfield formulation does not exist for all supersymmetric field theories .",
    "different particle species are truly unified in _ string _",
    "theories @xcite . in string theory",
    ", different particle species correspond to different states of a single object  the string .",
    "consequently , in supersymmetric string theory ( shortly  superstring theory ) , bosons and fermions correspond to different states of a single string .",
    "one of the differences between bosonic and fermionic particles is the fact that bosonic particles are described by _",
    "second_-order differential equations ( e.g. , klein - gordon equation ) , whereas fermionic particles are described by _",
    "first_-order differential equations ( e.g. , dirac equation ) .",
    "consequently , the properties of the associated conserved particle current @xmath0 are substantially different for bosons and fermions .",
    "the most notable difference is the fact that @xmath1 can not be negative for fermions , whereas it can be negative ( as well as positive ) for bosons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to bosonic and fermionic particles , a superstring satisfies a set of equations called super - virasoro constraints that , in particular , contains stringy analogs of _ both _ the klein - gordon equation and the dirac equation . in this paper",
    "we exploit this unifying feature of bosons and fermions to introduce a new , more unified , theoretical framework to describe some aspects of bosons and fermions .",
    "more precisely , we introduce ( i ) particle currents for bosons and fermions in a more symmetric manner , and ( ii ) a superstring current from which these bosonic and fermionic particle currents can be derived .    in construction of these particle and superstring currents we get confronted with two seemingly obscure features .",
    "first , it turns out that the symmetric treatment of bosonic and fermionic particle currents requires an introduction of a preferred foliation of spacetime .",
    "it seems surprising that a requirement of one symmetry ( a symmetry between bosons and fermions ) breaks another symmetry ( a spacetime symmetry ) .",
    "is there any reasonable physical interpretation of such a preferred foliation of spacetime ?",
    "second , the physical meaning of the particle and superstring currents themselves seems obscure too .",
    "what is the physical interpretation of these currents ? in this paper we argue that these seemingly obscure features acquire a natural interpretation in the context of _ bohmian _ interpretation of particles and strings . to explain it ,",
    "let us introduce the reader to the subject by shortly explaining what the significance of the bohmian interpretation is , what the main problems with this interpretation are , and how the results of this paper help in solving them .",
    "the bohmian interpretation @xcite is the best known and most successful attempt to introduce a hidden - variable completion of quantum mechanics ( qm ) . according to this interpretation , particle positions or fields have a continuous and deterministic dependence on time even when they are not measured , while all quantum uncertainties emerge from an ignorance of the actual initial conditions .",
    "this interpretation offers a solution to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics , but leads to several problems that make this interpretation not widely accepted .",
    "first , owing to the bell theorem @xcite , any hidden - variable completion of quantum mechanics must be nonlocal , which is usually considered unacceptable in particle physics and field theory .",
    "however , string theory contains certain nonlocal properties that have no analog in particle physics and field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so , as observed in @xcite , nonlocality does not seem to be an unacceptable feature from the point of view of string theory .",
    "moreover , the nonlocal string bohmian equation of motion seems to be a natural consequence of the world - sheet covariance of string theory @xcite , which is an argument for the bohmian interpretation that has no analog in particle physics .",
    "second , in the bohmian interpretation of nonstring theories , it is not clear whether the fundamental objects are particles or fields .",
    "owing to the fundamental difference between bosonic and fermionic particle currents discussed above , as well as owing to the obscure nature of grassmann - valued fields , it is often argued that bosons are fields , whereas fermions are particles @xcite .",
    "another boson - fermion asymmetric bohmian interpretation proposes that only bosonic fields have a true objective existence @xcite , so that all measurements eventually reduce to a detection of bosons ( e.g. , photons ) .",
    "however , such boson - fermion asymmetric interpretations are clearly incompatible with superstring theory . in this paper",
    "we formulate the bohmian interpretation of superstrings , which in the low - energy limit necessarily leads to a boson - fermion symmetric bohmian interpretation of bosonic and fermionic particles .",
    "thus , superstring theory supports a picture according to which , at low energies , fundamental objects are bosonic and fermionic particles , rather than fields .",
    "perhaps the most undesirable feature of the bohmian interpretation is the fact that all attempts to reconcile nonlocality of the bohmian interpretation with the requirement of relativistic covariance lead , in one way or another , to a preferred foliation of spacetime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "typically , a need for a preferred foliation occurs because one needs to specify a `` time coordinate '' with respect to which the nonlocal bohmian influences between spatially separated degrees of freedom are instantaneous . on the other hand , most other interpretations of quantum mechanics ( which , of course , have their own problems not shared by the bohmian interpretation ) do not need such a preferred foliation .",
    "therefore , the bohmian interpretation would be much more appealing if there were an interpretation - independent theoretical argument for the existence of a preferred foliation , or if it could be reformulated without need for a preferred foliation . in a sense , in this paper",
    "we do both .",
    "first , we argue that it is precisely the requirement of boson - fermion unification of the particle currents that provides such a missing argument for the existence of a preferred foliation , which then makes the bohmian interpretation more appealing as well .",
    "second , we formulate the bohmian interpretation in such a manner that it does not explicitly need a preferred foliation . instead , the preferred foliation is only needed to make an objective notion of particles consistent with quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetime , because otherwise particles are not well defined objects from the point of view of qft in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we study bosonic and fermionic particle currents and use heuristic arguments ( based on the assumption of boson - fermion unification ) to construct a new fermionic particle current that leads to a preferred spacetime foliation in effective field theory . in sec .",
    "[ string ] we introduce a natural superstring generalization of the particle current from which the unified bosonic and fermionic particle currents can be derived . sec .",

    "[ prob ] we study the probabilistic interpretation of nonrelativistic and relativistic wave functions and show that it is consistent with the deterministic bohmian interpretation .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] .    in the paper ,",
    "we use the spacetime signature @xmath2 , while the units are chosen so that @xmath3 .",
    "a prototype of a wave equation for a bosonic particle is the klein - gordon equation @xmath4 ( unless stated otherwise , in this section we assume that the number of spacetime dimensions is @xmath5 . )",
    "it describes particles with spin 0 .",
    "the associated conserved current is @xmath6 which is conserved in the sense that @xmath7 we see that the klein - gordon equation is a second - order equation , and consequently , that the conserved current contains the first derivatives of @xmath8 .",
    "we also see that @xmath9 is not necessarily positive .",
    "even if @xmath8 is a superposition of plane waves with positive frequencies only , @xmath1 may still be negative locally .",
    "in particular , it implies that @xmath1 can not be interpreted as a relativistic probability density .",
    "a prototype of a wave equation for a fermionic particle is the dirac equation @xmath10 it describes particles with spin @xmath11 .",
    "here @xmath12 are matrices that satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the minkowski metric .",
    "they also have the property @xmath15 , @xmath16 , for @xmath17 .",
    "the wave function @xmath8 is a 4-component spinor .",
    "the algebra ( [ clif ] ) implies that @xmath8 in ( [ dir ] ) also satisfies the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) . on the other hand , a solution of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) does not necessarily need to satisfy the dirac equation ( [ dir ] ) .",
    "consequently , from solutions of ( [ dir ] ) one can construct a different conserved current that , in general , can not be constructed from solutions of ( [ kg ] ) .",
    "this current naturally associated with ( [ dir ] ) is the dirac current @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that ( [ dircur ] ) transforms as a vector , and similarly , that @xmath20 transforms as a scalar .",
    "we see that the dirac equation ( [ dir ] ) is a first - order equation , and consequently , that the conserved current ( [ dircur ] ) does not contain derivatives of @xmath8 .",
    "( [ clif ] ) implies @xmath21 , so ( [ dircur ] ) implies @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , it implies that @xmath23 as given by ( [ dircur ] ) can , potentially , be interpreted as a relativistic probability density .",
    "( this , of course , does not prove that such an interpretation is physically correct . )",
    "the moral of this subsection is that , in the standard approach , there is a large difference between bosonic and fermionic wave functions and associated conserved currents . in particular , whereas the quantity @xmath24 can , potentially , be interpreted as a probability density for the fermionic case , such an interpretation of @xmath9 does not work in the bosonic case .",
    "of course , when @xmath8 is interpreted as a bosonic or a fermionic _ quantum field _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , then such a probabilistic interpretation of @xmath8 is no longer an issue .",
    "however , as reviewed in @xcite , quantum field theory ( qft ) does not completely solve the problem , because it does not explain why the  first - quantized \" probabilistic interpretation of @xmath25 is physically correct in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "moreover , from the string - theory perspective , it is possible that string field theory is _ not _ the correct approach to treat the string interactions @xcite , which implies that , at low energies , particles may be more fundamental objects than fields .",
    "thus , the goal of this paper is to introduce currents that treat bosons and fermions in a more symmetric way and to give an appropriate physical interpretation of such currents .      to make boson and fermion currents more similar",
    ", it has been proposed to replace the klein - gordon equation for spin-0 particles with a first - order equation similar to the dirac equation .",
    "such a first - order equation describing massive spin-0 particles is known as the duffin - kemmer equation @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 are matrices that satisfy @xmath28 the wave function @xmath29 has 5 components that are related to the klein - gordon wave function @xmath8 satisfying ( [ kg ] ) via @xmath30 the appropriate conserved current has been constructed in @xcite .",
    "( for a review with an application to the bohmian interpretation , see also @xcite . )",
    "one first constructs the conserved energy - momentum tensor @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the conserved current is then the duffin - kemmer current @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a unit future - oriented timelike vector .",
    "in particular , by taking @xmath35 , one finds @xmath36 , which , potentially , may be interpreted as a probability density . however , a price to be paid is that it is necessary to introduce a special timelike direction determined by the vector @xmath34 .",
    "this direction defines a _ preferred foliation of spacetime_.    we also note that bosonic and fermionic currents are still quite different , as the fermionic current ( [ dircur ] ) is not constructed from the energy - momentum tensor , whereas the bosonic current ( [ curdk ] ) is .",
    "in fact , as we shall see in sec .  [ string ] , the duffin - kemmer approach reviewed above does not seem to be supported by superstring theory .",
    "therefore , in the next subsection , we propose a different approach .      in the preceding subsection ,",
    "we have reviewed an approach that attempts to modify the bosonic current in a manner that makes it more similar to the standard fermionic current .",
    "one of the consequences is a need to introduce a preferred foliation of spacetime . in this subsection",
    "we propose a reversed strategy : we modify the fermionic current in a manner that makes it more similar to the standard bosonic current .",
    "it will turn out that a need for an introduction of a preferred foliation of spacetime will emerge again .",
    "however , such a unified treatment of bosonic and fermionic currents will turn out to be supported by superstring theory .",
    "consider a spin-@xmath11 wave function @xmath8 that satisfies the dirac equation ( [ dir ] ) .",
    "there are 4  natural \" ( but different ) currentlike quantities that can be constructed from @xmath8 : @xmath37 let us shortly discuss their properties .",
    "the first current @xmath38 is the standard fermionic current ( [ dircur ] ) .",
    "it is conserved , real , and transforms as a vector .",
    "the second current @xmath39 is not conserved , the space components are not real , and it does not transform as a vector .",
    "the third current @xmath40 , just as the standard one , is conserved , real , and transforms as a vector .",
    "the last current @xmath41 is conserved and real , but it does not transform as a vector .",
    "so , which current is the correct one ?",
    "since our main guiding principle is the unification of bosons and fermions , the most natural choice is the last one @xmath42 because only this current has the same form as the bosonic current ( [ kgcur ] ) .",
    "more precisely , ( [ curbos ] ) looks just like a current of a many - component spin-0 wave .",
    "therefore , we propose that ( [ curbos ] ) is the correct current for fermionic particles .",
    "indeed , as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ string ] , such a unified particle current for bosons and fermions naturally emerges from superstring theory .",
    "therefore , for the sake of an easier comparison with superstrings , we also write ( [ curbos ] ) in a slightly different form . the spinor components",
    "@xmath43 can be represented by @xmath44 , which allows to view the label @xmath45 as a continuous label and , up to an inessential normalization factor , to write ( [ curbos ] ) as @xmath46 eq .  ( [ curbosgr ] ) will turn out to have a natural generalization in superstring theory .",
    "the problem with our choice ( [ curbos ] ) is that this current does not transform as a vector .",
    "nevertheless , this problem can be avoided by writing it as @xmath47 where @xmath35 . from the last expression in ( [ curuniv ] )",
    ", we see that this current transforms as a vector . however , the price paid is that it is necessary to introduce a preferred foliation of spacetime induced by the unit future - oriented timelike vector @xmath34 .",
    "the physical meaning of such a preferred foliation is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "it is interesting to observe that both attempts ( the one introduced in the preceding subsection as well as the one reviewed in sec .  [ secduff ] ) to introduce particle currents for bosons and fermions in a more similar way led to a preferred foliation of spacetime . does this fact bring a deeper physical message ? in this subsection we propose an answer to this question and support it by some quantitative and qualitative arguments .    in eq .",
    "( [ curuniv ] ) , the need for an introduction of a preferred foliation of spacetime emerged from the observation that otherwise the current ( [ curbos ] ) does not transform as a vector .",
    "but why exactly ( [ curbos ] ) does not transform as a vector ?",
    "this is because @xmath8 is a spinor ( not merely a collection of scalars ) that transforms nontrivially under lorentz transformations . but",
    "why must @xmath8 transform in such a nontrivial way ?",
    "this transformation is derived @xcite from the requirement that the dirac equation ( [ dir ] ) should be covariant . however , the crucial _ assumption _ in this derivation is that @xmath12 is _ not _ a vector , but a collection of fixed matrices .",
    "conversely , if @xmath12 were assumed to be a vector , then the covariance of ( [ dir ] ) would be consistent with the possibility that @xmath8 does _ not _ transform as a spinor , but merely as a collection of lorentz scalars .",
    "( this should not be confused with a more common approach based on vielbeins @xcite , in which @xmath12 transforms as a vector under general coordinate transformations . in this picture , @xmath8 transforms as a spinor under _ internal _ lorentz transformations , which does not comply with our unifying picture of bosons and fermions .",
    "the relation between these two pictures will become clearer in sec .",
    "[ string ] . ) in this case , the current ( [ curbos ] ) would be a genuine vector without the need for an introduction of a preferred foliation of spacetime .",
    "could such a reinterpretation of the current ( [ curbos ] ) be the correct one ? as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ string ] , in superstring theory ( which , indeed , provides an explicit unification of bosons and fermions ) @xmath12 really emerges from a vector quantity and @xmath8 really emerges from a quantity that transforms as a lorentz scalar .",
    "thus , _ from the fundamental superstring point of view , the current ( [ curbos ] ) is naturally interpreted as a genuine vector_.    now , with such a reinterpretation of @xmath12 and @xmath8 , it is the dirac current ( [ dircur ] ) @xmath48 that does not transform as a vector , unless a preferred foliation with the normal @xmath34 is used , so that we can write @xmath49 does the fact that now ( [ curd2 ] ) does not transform as a vector represent a physical problem ? for free particles , there are no substantial problems . for example , the dirac equation can be derived from a scalar lagrangian density @xmath50 , while the dirac current ( [ curd2 ] ) does not play a particular role for free particles .",
    "however , the dirac current plays an important role for particle _",
    "interactions_. for example , the coupling between a charged fermion and the electromagnetic field @xmath51 is given by the interaction lagrangian proportional to @xmath52 , which now is not a scalar , unless a preferred foliation is introduced .",
    "this means that a true problem occurs only when one attempts to describe particle _",
    "interactions_. however , from the fundamental superstring point of view , this does not represent a problem at all because , in perturbative superstring theory , all interactions are described by the _",
    "free _ superstring lagrangian @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem occurs only at the level of low - energy _ effective _ qft description of interactions .    the observations above also lead to an interesting reinterpretation of the theory of quantum particles and fields in classical curved backgrounds . in the usual interpretation of qft in curved spacetime @xcite , the fundamental quantity is assumed to be a quantum field operator @xmath53 , while the concept of a particle is regarded as emergent .",
    "it turns out that the notion of particles depends on the choice of the time coordinate with respect to which the notion of positive and negative frequencies is defined .",
    "in other words , in general , the notion of a particle is not well defined .",
    "an alternative is to introduce a preferred foliation of spacetime , which then allows to introduce a unique notion of particles described by local covariant field operators of particle currents @xcite .",
    "the point is that , when the field is assumed to be fundamental , then it is the particle ( not the field ) that is problematic and requires a preferred foliation . on the other hand , if one assumes that the fundamental quantity is not a field but a superstring , then the low - energy object described by the fundamental quantity is a particle , not a field .",
    "( of course , if the fundamental quantity at high energies is not a string but a string field , then the conclusion above changes . here , however , we consider the possibility that string field theory is _ not _ the correct approach to treat strings at a nonperturbative level @xcite . ) in other words , from the point of view of the fundamental perturbative superstring theory , at low energies particles are more fundamental objects than fields , while fields only serve as auxiliary mathematical objects useful for a description of particle interactions at low energies .",
    "this means that in curved spacetime particles should be well defined even without a preferred foliation , while it is the concept of an associated quantum field that is not well defined unless a preferred foliation is introduced .",
    "indeed , such a reinterpretation of qft in curved spacetime is consistent with our conclusion above that a need for a preferred foliation in the dirac current ( [ curd3 ] ) occurs only at the level of low - energy _ effective _ qft description of interactions .    to further clarify the conceptual difference between quantum particles and fields , consider a free hermitian quantum field operator @xmath53 satisfying the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) . to attribute a particle interpretation to the field @xmath53 ,",
    "one is forced to expand it as @xmath54 where the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 have positive and negative norms , respectively , and constitute some complete orthonormal set of solutions to ( [ kg ] ) . in the particle interpretation , the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 are interpreted as the destruction and creation operators , respectively . however , in a curved - spacetime generalization of ( [ kg ] ) , the choice of the basis @xmath59 is not unique , which implies that the definition of particles based on the destruction and creation operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 is also not unique . in particular , if @xmath60 is a qft state , then the positive - norm 1-particle wave function is @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the vacuum defined by @xmath63 .",
    "( for a generalization to the many - particle wave function and spin @xmath11 , see also @xcite . )",
    "thus , the 1-particle wave function @xmath64 is also not unique . in the conventional interpretation ,",
    "the field @xmath53 is , by assumption , always well defined , so it is the particle wave function @xmath64 on the left - hand side of ( [ wffield ] ) that can not be defined without a preferred foliation of spacetime .",
    "however , in our reinterpretation , fields and wave functions exchange their roles . now",
    "the particle wave function @xmath64 is assumed to be fundamental and well defined .",
    "the field then only plays an auxiliary role in writing the wave function in terms of fields as in ( [ wffield ] ) . to do this ,",
    "one is forced to expand the positive - norm 1-particle wave function @xmath64 as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are some complex coefficients , so that one can _ define _ the auxiliary field operator through the expansion ( [ eqf ] ) that allows the identification ( [ wffield ] ) .",
    "now it is the field operator ( [ eqf ] ) that depends on the choice of the basis @xmath59 , while the expansion ( [ eqp ] ) of the wave function is considered purely conventional .",
    "( we shall discuss it more systematically elsewhere . )",
    "although we are not able to prove explicitly that the preferred foliation needed for the unification of bosonic and fermionic currents must necessarily coincide with the preferred foliation needed for the relation between particles and fields , the simplest possibility is , indeed , that these two foliations coincide .    to summarize , we conjecture that the preferred foliation that emerges from our attempt to introduce a unifying current for bosons and fermions is a manifestation of the fact that a qft description of particle interactions is not fundamental .",
    "the implications on the theory of particles and fields in curved spacetime will be studied in detail elsewhere .",
    "the fundamental physical origin of this preferred foliation is still unclear , but the sections that follow provide a further insight . in the next section",

    "[ sec2.1 ] , one could attempt to construct one superstring current for the bosonic ns sector and another superstring current for the fermionic r sector .",
    "however , according to the quantum superposition principle , a general quantum state is a _ superposition of states from both sectors_. this fact does not have an analog at the level of ( first - quantized ) particle wave functions ; a superposition of solutions of the klein - gordon and the dirac equation does not make sense .",
    "this reflects the fact that in particle physics , as well as in quantum field theory , different particle species correspond to genuinely different objects . on the other hand , in superstring theory different particle species are only different states of the same object  the superstring . therefore , in a consistent superstring theory",
    "_ there should be only one superstring current _ describing both ns and r sectors , as well as their arbitrary superpositions .",
    "consequently , as both sectors satisfy the stringy analog of the klein - gordon equation , it is the stringy analog of the klein - gordon equation , and not that of the dirac equation , from which the superstring current should be constructed .",

    "various boundary conditions are imposed on the states @xmath29 , not on the operators .",
    "the explicit representation of the operator @xmath141 will not be needed here , but we note that it is a direct sum of the corresponding operators for all sectors ( such as open r sector , closed r - r sector , etc . ) . for our purposes , it is sufficient to know that @xmath116 acts in some hilbert space with indices @xmath142 and that the basis on this hilbert space can be chosen such that a different index @xmath143 is attributed to each @xmath136 . therefore , the last equation in ( [ constrlfop ] ) can be written in the schrdinger picture as @xmath144=0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath145 $ ] is a functional of @xmath146 and @xmath143 , while @xmath147 , \\ ] ] with @xmath148 the quantity @xmath122 can be viewed as a hermitian operator with different eigen - values on different sectors , making ( [ kgs1 ] ) correct even for an arbitrary superposition of states from different sectors .",

    "finally , since @xmath149 in ( [ kgs2 ] ) is a hermitian operator that acts trivially in the space of functionals of @xmath159 , and since the dependence on @xmath142 is integrated out in ( [ curbosgrs ] ) , the presence of the term @xmath149 in ( [ kgs2 ] ) does not spoil the fact that the superstring current ( [ curbosgrs ] ) is conserved , in the sense that @xmath160    note that @xmath159 and @xmath142 in ( [ curbosgrs ] ) and ( [ consj ] ) are not treated on an equal footing , which means that the world - sheet supersymmetry is not manifest .",

    "as such , the trajectory does not depend on the parametrization with @xmath70 .",
    "the reparametrization of all trajectories in the congruence of integral curves is equivalent to a local rescaling of the current @xmath166 in eq .",

    "if @xmath168 is conserved , i.e. , if @xmath169 , then @xmath170 may not be conserved : @xmath171 thus , for the consistency of the bohmian interpretation ( [ bohm1 ] ) , the current @xmath168 does not necessarily need to be conserved .    by writing",

    "therefore , the equation of motion ( [ bohm1 ] ) can be written in the hamilton - jacobi form as @xmath177 however , the existence of such a hamilton - jacobi form is a consequence of the special form of the spin-0 current ( [ kgcur ] ) . for other spins , such a hamilton - jacobi form for the particle equation of motion does not exist .",

    "the velocity of one particle depends on the  instantaneous \" position of all other particles .",
    "such nonlocal  instantaneous \" communication is exactly what is needed to make the nonlocal correlations typical of qm @xcite consistent with the notion of objective reality .",

    "therefore , to make the existence of bohmian particle trajectories consistent with the standard qft predictions on particle creation and destruction , it turns out that one is forced to introduce some additional structure that , unfortunately , makes the theory less elegant .",
    "one possibility is to postulate stochastically chosen singular points at which particle trajectories begin or end , corresponding to particle creation or destruction @xcite . to avoid singular points and stochastic processes that break the spirit of the bohmian interpretation , another possibility is to introduce an additional continuously evolving property of the particle called _ effectivity _",

    "nevertheless , a relation with the foliation of spacetime exists : the vector @xmath200 associated with the foliation of spacetime can be projected onto the world - sheet , which then defines a foliation of the world - sheet as well .",

    "so far we have been assuming that @xmath29 satisfies the schrdinger equation ( [ schstr ] ) , but actually this is not the only equation that @xmath29 satisfies .",
    "first , it also satisfies the hamiltonian constraint @xmath210 , which means that @xmath29 in ( [ schstr ] ) does not really depend on @xmath70 , and consequently , that the propagators ( [ path1 ] ) and ( [ path2 ] ) do not really depend on @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "second , it also satisfies all other virasoro constraints for @xmath213 ( see eq .",

    "( [ path3 ] ) is nothing but the usual path - integral formula for calculating the string scattering amplitudes , where the summation over @xmath219 corresponds to the summation over feynman diagrams with different topologies .",

    "moreover , when the quantum - mechanical probabilities are well - defined by @xmath190 $ ] , then the corresponding probabilities predicted by the bohmian interpretation turn out to be exactly the same .",
    "( we discuss it in more detail in sec .",

    "some solutions describe deterministic processes of string splitting , which correspond to particle creation and destruction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an example ) .",
    "in fact , such splitting solutions exist even in classical string theory @xcite . in this way , unlike the bohmian interpretation of pointlike particles , the bohmian interpretation of strings does not need an artificial introduction of stochastic singular points at which the particle trajectories begin and end , or an artificial introduction of effectivities .",
    "thus , the bohmian interpretation of strings provides a very elegant solution to the problem of the bohmian description of particle creation and destruction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "now we also see why it is appealing that the current such as ( [ curbosgrsb ] ) may be locally spacelike . in the bohmian interpretation this corresponds to local superluminal velocities , which , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is related to string creation and destruction without leading to singular splitting points , provided that @xmath220 $ ] is sufficiently smooth , leading to a smooth right - hand side of ( [ bohm2s ] ) .",
    "( without superluminal velocities , the u - shape of the string boundary between the two crosses would be replaced by a v - shape containing a singular splitting point at the cusp . )    now the generalization of the bosonic - string results above to superstrings is straightforward , as we now discuss briefly .",
    "it is evident that the superstring generalization of ( [ curbosgrsb ] ) is the superstring current ( [ curbosgrs ] ) .",
    "thus , the natural interpretation of this superstring current is the bohmian interpretation defined by ( [ stringbohm2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath221 note that , in the superstring case , there is no bohmian equation of motion for the  classical \" grassmann valued coordinate @xmath72 in ( [ act ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to the fact that in particle bohmian mechanics there is no bohmian equation of motion for the spin of the particle @xcite .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom are integrated out in the particle case ( [ curbosgr ] ) in the same manner as the degrees of freedom attributed to @xmath116 are integrated out in the superstring case ( [ curbosgrs ] ) . in this way",

    "in the previous section we have presented the deterministic bohmian equations of motion for particles and strings .",
    "however , we have not explicitly explained how the usual probabilistic predictions of the conventional formulation of quantum theory can be recovered from these deterministic equations of motion .",
    "this is what we do in this section .",
    "our approach is based on the old idea @xcite that in relativistic qm the quantity @xmath222 represents the probability density of the particle position in _ spacetime _ , rather than that in space .",
    "such an approach has an advantage that the probabilistic interpretation is manifestly relativistic covariant and can be easily generalized to many particles and strings , without introducing any preferred foliation of spacetime . here , partially inspired by the results of @xcite",
    ", we construct a bohmian version of that interpretation . actually , we further refine the ideas of @xcite by showing that , even with the bohmian interpretation , the probabilistic predictions of particle positions are easily found on _ any _ hypersurface .",
    "( for further developments see also @xcite . )    the simplest way to understand our approach is to exploit the analogy with the well - understood case of free nonrelativistic particles in an energy eigenstate , by discussing the latter from a somewhat unusual point of view .",

    "we write the time - independent schrdinger equation in the form ( [ pr1 ] ) to make the analogy with the relativistic klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) obvious .",
    "the current @xmath228 satisfies the space - conservation equation @xmath229 which are ( up to an inessential normalization factor @xmath230 ) nonrelativistic analogs of ( [ kgcur ] ) and ( [ kgcur ] ) , respectively . how to interpret ( [ pr3 ] ) in terms of conserved probabilities ?",
    "since @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath231 , ( [ pr3 ] ) also trivially implies a conservation equation involving time @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath172 .",

    "indeed , ( [ pr6 ] ) is the standard nonrelativistic bohmian equation of motion .    in practice ,",
    "one rarely measures the probability density ( [ pr5 ] ) in the whole space .",
    "instead , one frequently deals with a beam moving in the @xmath236 direction and measures particle positions on the detection screen at @xmath237 .",
    "it is convenient to model the beam by a wave function localized in the @xmath238-@xmath239 directions , but infinitely extended in the @xmath236 direction .",
    "for example , the wave function may have the form @xmath240 where @xmath241 is a localized wave packet , but a more general dependence on @xmath236 is also possible .",
    "thus we have @xmath242 nevertheless , the property ( [ pr7 ] ) does not represent a practical problem , because the measured probability density of particle positions at @xmath237 is @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the normalization factor . even though the wave function can not be normalized in the whole space due to ( [ pr7 ] ) , the physically relevant normalization factor ( [ pr9 ] ) is finite . the probability density ( [ pr8 ] )",
    "is nothing but the conditional probability density derived from the joint probability density ( [ pr5 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that ( [ pr8 ] ) is consistent with the bohmian interpretation , but it is crucial to understand why exactly this is so .",
    "the bohmian trajectories are given by 3 functions @xmath245 satisfying ( [ pr6 ] ) .",

    "in fact , and this is the crucial point , _ the physical coordinate @xmath236 in ( [ pr11 ] ) plays a role of a time coordinate_. in this picture , @xmath248 describes how the wave function evolves with `` time '' @xmath236 , while ( [ pr8 ] ) is the probability density on a surface of constant `` time '' @xmath237 .",
    "the crucial point to note is that , with the dependence on @xmath236 more general than that in ( [ pr6.1 ] ) , the norm ( [ pr9 ] ) depends on @xmath249 .",
    "consequently , the probability density on a surface of constant `` time '' is not simply given by the numerator on the right - hand side of ( [ pr8 ] ) . nevertheless , the probability density _ is _ proportional to this numerator , with the proportionality factor being @xmath249-dependent as expressed by the denominator on the right - hand side of ( [ pr8 ] ) .    how can ( [ pr8 ] ) be understood from the bohmian 2 + 1 point of view ?",
    "in general , the trajectories ( [ pr11 ] ) may have a very strange appearance from the 2 + 1 perspective .",
    "for example , by allowing a more complicated dependence on @xmath236 in ( [ pr6.1 ] ) , the trajectories may even involve motions backwards in `` time '' .",
    "nevertheless , ( [ pr8 ] ) is the correct probability density on @xmath237 .",
    "this is because the _ a priori _ probability density on the whole space is given by ( [ pr5 ] ) . from the 2 + 1 perspective , it means that not only the initial particle position @xmath250 , @xmath251 is unknown and hence subject to the probabilistic law , but also the value of the initial `` time '' @xmath252 itself is unknown and hence subject to the probabilistic law .",
    "now let us briefly generalize all this to an @xmath108-particle energy eigenstate .",
    "most of it is obvious , so let us only discuss some less obvious features .",
    "the @xmath108-particle energy eigenstate is described by a wave function @xmath253 .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability density ( [ pr5 ] ) generalizes to @xmath254 since it does not depend on @xmath231 , it is the correct joint probability density even if different particles are detected at different @xmath231 .",
    "( note that the calculation of the joint probability density does not involve an effective collapse of the wave function .",
    "the collapse is only related to the calculation of a conditional probability density , such as calculating the probability that the particle 2 has the position @xmath255 at time @xmath256 , given that the particle 1 has been found at the position @xmath257 at time @xmath258 . ) as in the 1-particle case above , we are interested in a situation in which @xmath231 is an unmeasured ( and hence effectively unphysical ) parameter . in general",
    ", it can be arranged that different particles are detected on screens positioned at different values of @xmath236 .",
    "hence , ( [ pr8])-([pr9 ] ) generalize to @xmath259 @xmath260 .",
    "the bohmian trajectories @xmath261 can be viewed as @xmath108 curves in 4 dimensions . but time can be eliminated , leading to functions @xmath262 , which can be viewed as @xmath108 curves in 3 dimensions @xmath263 . now ( [ pr8.1 ] ) is consistent with the trajectories @xmath263 because not only the initial conditions @xmath264 are subject to the probabilistic law ( [ pr5.1 ] ) , but so are the initial `` times '' @xmath265 themselves .",
    "now we are finally ready to deal with the relativistic case .",
    "actually , with the nonrelativistic case being described as above , the generalization to the relativistic case is very simple . essentially , all we need to do is to add one dimension more .",
    "more precisely , the transition from a nonrelativistic particle in an energy eigenstate to a relativistic particle is accomplished through the following correspondence : @xmath266 in particular , the parameter @xmath70 in ( [ bohm2 ] ) can be thought of as a scalar time corresponding to a fifth dimension @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath70 is an auxiliary unphysical parameter , i.e. , we are not equipped with a clock that measures it .",
    "hence it is natural to eliminate @xmath70 , so that ( [ bohm2 ] ) describes a curve in 4 physical dimensions .",
    "the wave function @xmath64 does not depend on @xmath70 , so ( [ pr4 ] ) generalizes to @xmath267 where @xmath268 and the second term in ( [ pr4.2 ] ) vanishes due to ( [ kgcur ] ) .",
    "consequently , ( [ pr5 ] ) generalizes to @xmath269 which defines a probability density conserved in @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath70 is unphysical , ( [ pr5.2 ] ) can also be thought of as the _ a priori _ probability density that particle will be found at any point @xmath270 in spacetime . in other words , ( [ pr5.2 ] ) is the probability density of _ flashes _ in spacetime .",
    "at this point it is interesting to note that flashes in spacetime have also been introduced in a different context @xcite , as a way to make the objective - collapse interpretation of qm fully compatible with relativity . in our approach , ( [ pr5.2 ] ) will be the ultimate reason why the probabilistic predictions of the bohmian interpretation are fully compatible with relativity .",
    "thus , in both cases the ultimate origin of the compatibility between relativity and hidden variables for qm lies in a use of flashes in spacetime , which can not be a coincidence . nevertheless , in our bohmian approach the particles are not flashes but continuous trajectories in spacetime , while the flashes correspond only to initial conditions .",
    "namely , a bohmian trajectory can be specified by fixing @xmath271 , which , after elimination of the variable @xmath70 , means that one must fix @xmath272 , @xmath17 , as well as @xmath273 itself .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability density for such an initial condition is given by ( [ pr5.2 ] )",
    ".    the probability density ( [ pr5.2 ] ) can not be normalized in the whole spacetime , due to an analog of ( [ pr7 ] ) @xmath274 nevertheless , this is not a problem in practice if one is interested in the probability for a fixed @xmath275 . if one is certain that a particle will be detected at the time @xmath276 , then the probability distribution of particle positions in space at @xmath276 is given by the conditional probability density @xmath277 where @xmath278 these equations are nothing but obvious generalizations of ( [ pr8 ] ) and ( [ pr9 ] ) . in nonrelativistic qm , where @xmath279 satisfies a first - order differential equation with respect to @xmath231 , the norm ( [ pr9.2 ] ) does not depend on @xmath231 .",
    "in relativistic qm described by the klein - gordon equation this norm may depend on @xmath231 ( actually , it depends on @xmath231 only if @xmath8 is a superposition of solutions with both positive and negative frequencies @xcite ) , which is the standard argument that @xmath280 is not the probability density at fixed time in relativistic qm .",
    "nevertheless , now we see that the probability density at fixed time is proportional to @xmath280 , with the time - dependent proportionality factor given by the denominator on the right - hand side of ( [ pr8.2 ] ) .",
    "given the _ a priori _ probability density of flashes ( [ pr5.2 ] ) , it is clear that ( [ pr8.2 ] ) is the correct conditional probability density .",
    "however , in nonrelativistic qm , ( [ pr8.2 ] ) ( with constant @xmath281 ) is interpreted as an _ a priori _ probability density , i.e. , one allways assumes that one _ is _ certain that the particle will be detected at any fixed value of @xmath231 .",
    "can one be certain that this will also be the case when one starts from ( [ pr5.2 ] ) ?",
    "while it may be a difficult conceptual question within the orthodox probabilistic interpretation of qm ( which may be a reason why the probabilistic interpretation of qm advocated in @xcite is not widely accepted ) , this question has a simple answer within the bohmian interpretation .",
    "since particles are actually trajectories ( not merely flashes ) in spacetime , one expects that every trajectory associated with a free klein - gordon equation crosses any given hypersurface of equal time .",
    "indeed , we have performed some numerical computations that give evidence that this is indeed the case when @xmath8 is a superposition of positive - frequency solutions only .",
    "consequently , one can be certain that a particle will be detected at any fixed value of @xmath231 ( assuming , of course , an ideal detector with perfect efficiency ) .",
    "now we can generalize it to @xmath108-particle relativistic qm .",
    "due to ( [ consoverall ] ) , the conservation equation ( [ pr4.2 ] ) generalizes to @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the right - hand side of ( [ bohm2n ] ) .",
    "consequently , by analogy with ( [ pr5.1 ] ) , ( [ pr5.2 ] ) generalizes to @xmath284 which is consistent with the bohmian equation of motion ( [ bohm2n ] ) .",
    "similarly , by analogy with ( [ pr8.1])-([pr9.1 ] ) , ( [ pr8.2])-([pr9.2 ] ) generalize to @xmath285 @xmath286 ) .",
    "it can also be generalized to the case in which the hypersurfaces of constant @xmath287 are replaced by arbitrary curved spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath288 .",
    "on such general hypersurfaces one needs to know the determinants of the induced metric @xmath289 , where @xmath290 are the coordinates on @xmath288 .",
    "( [ pr8.3])-([pr9.3 ] ) then further generalize to latexmath:[\\[\\label{pr8.4 } \\tilde{p}_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n}({\\bf x}_1,\\ldots,{\\bf x}_n ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{|g^{(3)}_1({\\bf x}_1)| } \\cdots \\sqrt{|g^{(3)}_n({\\bf x}_n)| } \\ ;    latexmath:[\\[\\label{pr9.4 } n_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_n}=\\int_{\\sigma_1 } d^3x_1 \\sqrt{|g^{(3)}_1({\\bf x}_1)| } \\cdots \\int_{\\sigma_n } d^3x_n \\sqrt{|g^{(3)}_n({\\bf x}_n)| } \\ ;    denotes that it transforms as a scalar density , which in curved coordinates should be distinguished from a quantity that transforms as a scalar .",
    "what remains is to generalize all this to bosonic strings and superstrings .",
    "the generalization to bosonic strings is trivial because all one needs to do is to replace the discrete label @xmath122 by a continuous variable @xmath136 . in particular , the analog of ( [ pr5.3 ] ) is @xmath292=|\\psi[x]|^2 , \\ ] ] and similarly for the other equations . for superstrings , it further generalizes to @xmath293=\\int[dm ] \\ , |\\psi[m , x]|^2 .\\ ] ] indeed , @xmath70 in ( [ stringbohm2.2 ] ) can be rescaled , such that the bohmian equation of motion becomes @xmath294 } .\\ ] ] this is consistent with the conservation equation @xmath295 that results from ( [ consj ] ) .",
    "few additional remarks are in order .",
    "first , the probabilistic interpretation ( [ pr5.4 ] ) requires that @xmath190 $ ] should be formally normalized such that @xmath296\\ , |\\psi[x]|^2=1 $ ] .",
    "however , the integral @xmath296\\ , |\\psi[x]|^2 $ ] is actually infinite , so such a normalization does not exist in a strict sense .",
    "nevertheless , this integral can be made finite by replacing the measure @xmath204 $ ] by an appropriately regularized measure .",
    "( for example , @xmath136 can be replaced by a discrete variable and the range of values of @xmath297 can be taken to be finite . ) at the end of calculation the regularization parameters can be turned back to their natural values .",
    "one does not expect that such manipulations would affect the final measurable results , but a detailed analysis of these technical subtleties is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "second , the probabilistic interpretation ( [ pr5.4 ] ) or ( [ pr5.5 ] ) is not the probabilistic interpretation used in standard applications of string theory .",
    "in fact , in standard applications of string theory one does not discuss a probabilistic interpretation in the configuration space at all . instead , one is usually interested in probabilities that the string will end up in a state @xmath298 $ ] , where @xmath298 $ ] is a state that has definite values of particle - like properties ( such as energy , momentum , and spin ) interesting in scattering experiments . by writing @xmath299=\\sum_a",
    "c_a \\psi_a[x , m ] , \\ ] ] the appropriate probabilities are @xmath300 .",
    "the standard applications of string theory are concentrated on practical methods for calculation of the amplitudes @xmath301 . however",
    ", a complete quantum description must also involve a description of the measuring apparatus .",
    "thus , instead of ( [ meas1 ] ) , we actually have the total wave functional @xmath302=\\sum_a c_a \\psi_a[x , m ] \\phi_a[x_{\\rm app},m_{\\rm app } ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath303 $ ] are normalized states of the measuring apparatus that do not overlap in the @xmath304-space .",
    "consequently , the probabilistic interpretation ( [ pr5.5 ] ) provides that the probability that @xmath304 will take a value from the support of @xmath303 $ ] is equal to @xmath305 .",
    "this shows that the probabilistic interpretation ( [ pr5.4 ] ) is compatible with the standard one .",
    "third , the probabilistic interpretation ( [ pr5.5 ] ) allows one additional argument for the equation of motion ( [ stringbohm2.3 ] ) . even without the bohmian interpretation ,",
    "the average local momentum of the string is @xmath306 \\int [ dm ] \\ , \\psi^*[x , m ] \\hat{p}^{\\mu}(\\sigma ) \\psi[x , m ] = \\int [ dx ] \\frac { j^{\\mu}[x;\\sigma)}{2 } , \\ ] ] where ( [ eqn34 ] ) and ( [ curbosgrs ] ) have been used to obtain the second equality .",
    "we require that the average momentum of bohmian trajectories should be equal to the quantum - mechanical average momentum ( [ aver1 ] ) .",
    "since the bohmian velocities have the same directions in spacetime as bohmian momenta , the simplest way to accomplish this requirement is to postulate that the bohmian velocities have the same directions as @xmath161 .",
    "this leads to ( [ stringbohm2.2 ] ) equivalent to ( [ stringbohm2.3 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , instead of invoking the argument of simplicity , the same result can be obtained by applying a relativistic generalization of the argument in @xcite based on weak measurements of velocities .",
    "of course , analogue arguments can also be applied to bosonic string theory without the @xmath142 variable .",
    "fourth , even though the bohmian velocities ( [ stringbohm2.3 ] ) may be spacelike and past - oriented in some cases , no deviations from predictions of standard quantum theory are possible when these velocities are measured , i.e. , when the total state is of the form of ( [ meas2 ] ) with @xmath307 being the eigenstates of @xmath308 . in particular , superstring theory does not contain tachyons , so measured velocities can not be spacelike .",
    "this paper contains several new results on boson - fermion unification , string theory , and bohmian mechanics .",
    "as our main aim is to emphasize the new conceptual aspects , some results can certainly be formulated more rigorously in the future .",
    "but what exactly are the problems that these results are supposed to solve ?",
    "it depends on what one considers to be a problem .    from the perspective of a traditional theoretician not interested in foundations of quantum mechanics ( qm )",
    ", we have contributed to the understanding of boson - fermion unification by constructing unifying particle and superstring currents .",
    "we have also seen that these currents lead to a preferred spacetime foliation in effective field theory and indicated how it reinterprets the notion of particles in qft in curved spacetime . still , to fully understand the physical meaning of these currents , it is necessary to deal with foundations of qm itself .    from the perspective of physicists interested in various interpretations of qm ,",
    "we have presented a new argument for the naturalness of the bohmian interpretation , by observing that this is a natural interpretation of the unifying particle and superstring currents .",
    "in addition , we have further developed a relativistic covariant probabilistic interpretation of wave functions based on earlier ideas @xcite .    from the perspective of physicists interested in the internal problems of the bohmian interpretation ,",
    "we have offered solutions to several fundamental problems of that interpretation .",
    "these problems and solutions may be summarized by the following items :    1 .",
    "fundamental ontology  only strings ( appearing as particles at low energies ) have an objective existence , for both fermions and bosons .",
    "2 .   creation and destruction of particles  corresponds to continuous string splitting described by the bohmian equation of motion .",
    "superluminal bohmian velocities  play an appealing role for string splitting without singular splitting points .",
    "preferred foliation of spacetime  appears to be related ( in a surprising way ) to the boson - fermion unification .",
    "relativistic covariance  once the particle or string wave function is known , the bohmian equations of motion and the corresponding probabilistic predictions are well defined and relativistic covariant .    of course , string theory , supersymmetry , and boson - fermion unification are still not experimentally confirmed , so other variants of the bohmian interpretation are not excluded by our theoretical results .",
    "nevertheless , from an aesthetical point of view , such a unified bohmian picture seems to be a very natural one .",
    "in addition , as both superstring theory and bohmian mechanics contain some nonlocal features that may manifest as a preferred foliation of spacetime , it is possible that there is an even deeper not yet discovered relation between these two theories .",
    "therefore , we believe that our results show that physicists interested in the bohmian interpretation should become more interested in superstring theory .",
    "conversely , we also believe that the results of this paper , together with those of @xcite , suggest that physicists interested in string theory should become more interested in bohmian mechanics as well .",
    "the fact that both theories are often unjustifiably criticized for not being experimentally testable is not the only thing that relates them .",
    "although the fundamental problem of measurement in qm is traditionally not regarded as a problem that the  theory of everything \" is supposed to solve , our results on the relation between superstring theory and bohmian mechanics suggest that the solution of the measurement problem could also be a part of it .",
