    "the diffusion is anomalous when the variance rises with time slower or faster than linearly and the density distribution differs from the normal distribution .",

    "traps hamper the transport and , as a consequence , a subdiffusion emerges  as well as a stretched - gaussian asymptotics of the distribution @xcite .",
    "we encounter such a situation for disordered media with impurities and defects .",
    "if the waiting time distribution is not prescribed to a given position and changes at each visit of the particle , we are dealing with an annealed disorder which corresponds to a renewal process .",
    "then the continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) is well suited to model the anomalous diffusion .",
    "if , on the other hand , the particle exercises a space structure which slowly evolves with time , the trapping time at a given site is the same for each visit of this site and a correlation between trapping times emerges ( a quenched disorder ) @xcite .",
    "the quenched trap model @xcite takes into account that the particle may remember the rest time at a given point .",
    "then the time - dependence of the variance can be derived by averaging over disorder @xcite or using a renormalisation group approach @xcite ; it takes a form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 characterises the memory .",
    "the central limit theorem may not apply also in the markovian case since a nonhomogeneous structure of the environment makes subsequent random stimulations mutually dependent .",
    "considering , in particular , the diffusion on fractals one must take into account the self - similar medium structure ; it is described by the fokker - planck equation with a variable diffusion coefficient @xcite ( for a non - markovian generalisation see @xcite ) .",
    "ctrw involves , in general , a coupled jump density distribution .",
    "when the waiting - time distribution is position - dependent , the fokker - planck equation , corresponding to the master equation , contains the variable diffusion coefficient @xcite and , in the non - markovian case , a variable order of the fractional derivative @xcite . for such inhomogeneous problems",
    ", ctrw implies a stretched - gaussian shape of the density distribution and predicts the anomalous diffusion .",
    "if , on the other hand , the jump length does not obey the normal distribution but is governed by a general lvy stable distribution ( lvy flights ) the variance does not exist ; such long jumps are frequently observed in many areas of science @xcite . they may be directly related to a specific topology of the medium and then the transport description requires a variable diffusion coefficient : the folded polymers are a well - known example @xcite .",
    "if a composite medium consists of many layers , the fractional equation is complicated and contains position - dependent both the diffusion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative @xcite .",
    "however , presence of the lvy flights does not need to imply infinite fluctuations because any physical system is finite and , if one introduces a truncation of the distribution tail , the diffusion properties are well - determined .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated that cracking of heterogeneous materials reveals a slowly falling power - law tail of the local velocity distribution of the crack front @xcite but , despite that , the authors were able to determine the variance due to the finiteness of the system .",
    "systems with memory can be conveniently handled in terms of a langevin equation by introducing an auxiliary operational time .",
    "process given by this equation is subsequently subordinated to the random physical time by means of a one - sided probability distribution with a long tail @xcite ; such a system of the langevin equations is used as an alternative formulation of ctrw @xcite and also applied to quenched random media @xcite where the intensity of the random time distribution depends on the position .",
    "ctrw was applied to transport in the heterogeneous media by using fractional derivatives @xcite and a subordinated system of langevin equations @xcite .",
    "a subordination formalism , which directly takes into account that the memory in nonhomogeneous systems must depend on the position , has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "this dependence was introduced via a variable intensity of the random time distribution and models the influence of the trap geometry on the local time lag .",
    "the system is then described by a set of two langevin equations , @xmath2 where a non - negative random time intensity @xmath3 defines a position - dependence of the memory effects and results from the presence of traps .",

    "it is well - known that for the gaussian processes the ordinary rules of the calculus are valid in the case of si , in contrast to the other interpretations , which allows us to transform the equation with the multiplicative noise into an equation with the additive noise by a simple variable change .",
    "as regards the general stable processes , we observe the same property : the numerical solutions of the langevin equation by using eq.([riem ] ) with @xmath81 agree with those where a standard technique of the variable change is applied @xcite .",
    "obviously , the ordinary rules of the calculus are always valid if one defines the white noise as a limit of the coloured noise @xcite ; equivalence of that limit and si is an important property of the multiplicative gaussian processes . in the case of eq.([lam ] ) , we obtain the equation with the additive noise by changing the variable , @xmath83 , in the first of eq.([lam ] ) .",
    "next , we decouple the medium structure and memory ( cf . eq.([las ] ) ) and get the equation @xmath84 .",

    ". then the variance was determined by a numerical solving of eq.([lam ] ) where the multiplicative noise was treated according to eq.([riem1 ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the time - dependence of the variance has the same form as eq.([war1t0 ] ) but with a modified index , @xmath181 .",
    "this form was found for all the parameters ",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath5 and @xmath50  if @xmath155 was large .",
    "the above observation is illustrated in fig.3 where some examples of @xmath182 are presented .",
    "dependence of the slope on the parameters is presented in the subsequent figures .",
    "fig.4 shows @xmath183 as a function of @xmath27 for two values of @xmath5 ; it diminishes with @xmath27 and the numerical results reveal a dependence @xmath174 ( the coefficient @xmath184 is indicated in the figure ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath183 on @xmath5 is presented in fig.5 for two values of @xmath27 , both negative and positive .",
    "whereas in the former case @xmath183 is almost constant  and larger than the value predicted by eq.([war1t0 ] )  for the positive @xmath27 we observe a linear growth in a wide range of @xmath5 ; @xmath185 becomes flat only at large @xmath5 .",
    "finally , fig.6 shows that the slope for a positive ( negative ) @xmath27 rises with @xmath50 weaker ( stronger ) than for @xmath69 and both dependences are linear .",
    "the superdiffusion emerges when @xmath27 is negative and @xmath50 large .",
    "the proposed formalism is applicable to diffusion problems where memory is connected with nonhomogeneous medium structure .",
    "therefore , we conclude with some remarks concerning the parameters in the above analysis ; they may be useful to compare the results with an experiment .",
    "we interpreted the multiplicative noise @xmath95 in eq.([lam ] ) according to si .",
    "this interpretation is distinguished in stochastic problems because it constitutes a white - noise limit of coloured noises for any @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the other interpretations may also be important .",
    "for example , the experimental analysis of the colloidal particles diffusion near the boundary favours aii ( @xmath82 ) @xcite , as we have already mentioned .",
    "we performed the numerical calculations for aii , similar to those for si , and found the same diffusion properties in respect both to the exponent and the proportionality coefficient .",
    "this conclusion could be anticipated from fig.1 : tails of the distribution for both interpretations are very similar .",
    "moreover , results presented in fig.4 - 6 are independent of @xmath135 and @xmath155 if @xmath155 is sufficiently large .",
    "the other parameters have a straightforward interpretation : @xmath5 defines the jump statistics , @xmath50 is responsible for the trapping time characterising the depth of the effective trapping potential and @xmath27 is responsible for the trap distribution .",
    "the stochastic motion in a medium with traps was studied in terms of the langevin equation and the anomalous diffusion exponent was determined .",
    "the memory effects were taken into account by a subordination of a markovian process to a physical , random time and the nonhomogeneity of the trap structure by a dependence of the time lag on the position , modelled by a non - negative function @xmath3 .",
    "if one decouples effects related to the trap structure and memory , the problem resolves itself to a multiplicative process subordinated to the random time .",
    "the langevin equation in the operational time describes a markovian jumping process with a variable rate of the poissonian waiting - time distribution .",
    "the density distribution can be exactly derived if @xmath3 has a power - law form .",
    "it has a stretched - gaussian shape and this result is similar to the prediction of the quenched trap model @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to that model , the variance may rise with time faster than linearly ; beside the subdiffusion , observed for the homogeneous case , the enhanced diffusion emerges .",
    "if one interprets the position - dependence of the memory in terms of a variable trap density and assume it in a power - law form , such a density corresponds to a fractal pattern .",
    "then the fractal dimension determines the diffusion properties : the smaller the dimension , the faster the variance grows with time .",
    "lvy flights are characterised by the infinite variance but a finite size of the system may modify the random stimulation .",
    "in contrast to the usual truncation procedure where long jumps are eliminated , our approach imposes a restriction on the noise intensity by introducing a multiplicative noise to the langevin equation .",
    "this noise may follow from a complicated medium structure near the boundary which requires a generalisation of a simple modelling in terms of the additive noise .",
    "the resulting density distributions have fast falling tails .",
    "therefore , diffusion inside the substrate is well - determined and may be quantified in terms of the variance the time - dependence of which does not depend of the system size . moreover , the diffusion properties appear robust in respect to a particular interpretation of the multiplicative noise in the langevin equation .",
    "on the other hand , diffusion inside a layer near the boundary is weaker than in the bulk and we observe two regimes with a different anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath183 .",
    "this exponent reflects both the magnitude of the memory in the system , described by the parameter @xmath50 , and the position - dependence of the memory , given by the parameter @xmath27 : it diminishes with @xmath27 and rises with @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath69 , we observe a dependence of @xmath183 on @xmath5 but only for small @xmath5 and positive @xmath27 .",
    "this conclusion points at a subtle relation between the nonhomogeneous distribution of the random time statistics and the noise statistics in respect to the diffusion properties of systems with the lvy flights .",
    "in this appendix , we demonstrate that the first part of eq.([las ] ) traces back to a markovian jumping process @xcite . this stationary process is defined by a jump - size distribution @xmath186 in a form of the lvy @xmath5-stable and symmetric distribution with a characteristic function , @xmath187 the particle performs instantaneous jumps and then rests for a time given by a waiting - time distribution which is poissonian , @xmath188 where @xmath21 denotes a position - dependent rate .",
