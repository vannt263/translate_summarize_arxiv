    "in recent years much effort has been devoted to the characterization of nonequilibrium systems for which no general theoretical framework is available .",
    "some notable progress has been achieved in the study of rather generic properties of these systems , as for example the entropy production and currents in nonequilibrium steady states @xcite , the aging phenomena in systems relaxing towards steady states @xcite , or the fluctuation properties of systems driven out of a steady state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a large part of this progress is closely related to the discovery of various fluctuation and work theorems that provide generic statements applicable to large classes of systems .",
    "one of the best known theorems is crooks relation for a system , initially in equilibrium , that is driven out of equilibrium through a time - dependent process .",
    "repetition of this forward process allows to determine the probability distribution @xmath3 of the dissipative work @xmath4 . when comparing this probability distribution with that obtained from the time - reversed process , called @xmath5 , one observes the following very simple relation @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this detailed fluctuation theorem is closely connected to other relations , notably jarzynski s work theorem .",
    "the latter is an integral fluctuation relation that relates for the special case of equilibrium initial and final states the free energy difference @xmath8 to an average over all processes leading from one state to the other : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the work done on the system .",
    "both the jarzynski and the crooks relations have been generalized to various other situations .",
    "assuming microreversibility , integral and detailed fluctuation theorems @xcite have been derived for the hatano - sasa entropy @xmath1 , also called the driving entropy production , a quantity that is closely related to the excess heat .",
    "for an equilibrium system @xmath1 reduces to the dissipative work @xmath4 and the theorems become identical to the jarzynski and crooks relations .",
    "in addition , an integral fluctuation theorem has also been formulated for the housekeeping heat @xcite .",
    "finally , it was shown recently that under the same assumptions of microreversibility integral and detailed fluctuation theorems also hold for the adiabatic and nonadiabatic trajectory entropies @xcite .    in absence of microscopic reversibility , as it is for example the case in reaction - diffusion systems , a detailed fluctuation theorem , which is based on a forward path and the time - reversed path , does not hold @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies of two of us revealed that for the hatano - sasa entropy the deviations of the fluctuation ratio from a simple exponential contain non - trivial information on the trajectories in configuration space @xcite .    in this work",
    "we revisit the fluctuation relations involving the hatano - sasa entropy when driving a system out of a steady state .",
    "we confirm that an integral fluctuation theorem is always recovered , irrespective of whether the processes are reversible or not . in the limit of slow processes , where the time between changes of some external parameter is long enough for the system to reach the steady state , a detailed fluctuation theorem prevails .",
    "finally , we discuss many - state processes that are irreversible and violate detailed balance and show that for large classes of these processes crooks relation for the hatano - sasa entropy remains valid .",
    "this remarkable result is obtained through a coarsening theorem that states that some many - state processes can be coarse - grained into systems with fewer states that have the same spectrum of @xmath1 and the same probabilities for each @xmath1 as the original systems .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections ii and iii focus on exact results on the realm of validity of fluctuation relations involving the hatano - sasa entropy .",
    "section ii is mainly devoted to the case of slow processes , whereas in section iii we discuss the coarse - graining procedure and its consequences for the detailed fluctuation theorem in many - state processes . in section",
    "iv we illustrate our main results through numerical studies of selected systems . finally , section v gives our conclusions .",
    "we consider in the following a stochastic dynamical process driven by an external parameter @xmath11 , and characterized by its internal state @xmath12  @xcite . the system is taken through a series of changes , over a total period of time , @xmath13 , whereupon the parameter @xmath11 is varied from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in a series of @xmath16 steps , each lasting a time @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the _ steady state _ pdf of the system , under @xmath18 , by @xmath19 , and write it , more compactly , as @xmath20    let @xmath21 denote the transition probability , in the time interval @xmath22 , from the initial state @xmath23 to the final state @xmath24 , when the driving parameter is @xmath18 .",
    "the weight of the particular _ path _ @xmath25=(x_0,\\g_0),(x_1,\\g_1),\\dots,(x_m,\\g_m)$ ] is given by @xmath26)=\\r_0(x_0)\\prod_{n=0}^{m-1}p_{n+1}(x_{n+1}|x_n)\\,,\\ ] ] and the average of a dynamical quantity , @xmath27)$ ] , over all possible histories , is given by @xmath28)w([x,\\g])\\,dx_0\\,dx_1\\cdots dx_m\\,.\\ ] ]    suppose that the initial pdf of the system , at time @xmath29 , is @xmath30 , then the pdf at time @xmath31 is @xmath32 by the very definition of the steady state : since the system is in the steady state to begin with , it will remain there regardless of how long it evolves ( assuming that the external parameters are held constant ) .",
    "if the initial state is different , for example , @xmath33 , the pdf after time @xmath22 , @xmath34 is _ not _ necessarily equal to the steady state @xmath35 .",
    "note , however , that if @xmath36 the system would eventually arrive at the steady state , regardless of its initial condition : @xmath37 we call _ slow process _ a process where the system is allowed to reach the steady state after each incremental change in the external parameters ( by letting @xmath36 ) . using ( [ pslow ] ) , we see then that the weight of a path for a slow process assumes the much simpler form : @xmath38)=\\prod_{n=0}^{m}\\r_n(x_n)\\,;\\qquad{\\rm slow\\ process.}\\ ] ] in the following we explore the validity of different fluctuation relations within the setting just described .",

    "thus , @xmath45 .",
    "it has to be noted that this result is valid for all processes , as we did not make any restricting assumptions .",
    "especially , the processes do not need to be reversible nor slow .",
    "the pdf of @xmath1 is given by @xmath47\\right)w([x,\\g])\\,dx_0\\,dx_1\\cdots dx_m\\,.\\ ] ] since the integrals involved are often hard to evaluate , we prefer working with the fourier transform : @xmath48    we now turn to the ratio of the pdf s for the _ forward _ and _ backward _ processes .",
    "the forward process is the process we have been considering all along .",
    "the backward process , is the same process but where the order of states is reversed",
    ". it can be thought of as a forward process along the reversed path @xmath25=(x_m,\\g_m),(x_{m-1},\\g_{m-1}),\\dots,(x_0,\\g_0)$ ] , obtained by making the substitution @xmath49 .",
    "note that in the backward process @xmath50 is assumed to be in the steady state , while @xmath51 is generically _ not _ in the steady state .",
    "thus , the backward process is not a perfect time - reversal of the forward process , but the reversal is only in the sequence of states .",
    "putting  ( [ eq : pphi ] ) and  ( [ wpath ] ) in  ( [ eq : fpphi ] ) and carrying out the integration over @xmath1 first , we obtain for the forward process @xmath52^{-ik}p_{n+1}(x_{n+1}|x_n)\\right\\}dx_0\\cdots dx_m\\\\ & = \\int\\cdots\\int\\rho_0(x_0)^{1-ik}\\prod_{n=1}^{m-1}\\left\\{\\left[\\frac{\\rho_n(x_n)}{\\rho_{n}(x_{n-1})}\\right]^{-ik}p_{n}(x_{n}|x_{n-1})\\right\\}\\rho_m(x_{m-1})^{ik}dx_0\\cdots dx_{m-1}\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , for the second line , we have rearranged the product and integrated over @xmath53 , using the fact that @xmath54 .",
    "if the states of the system form a discrete set , @xmath55 , the remaining integrals can be put in the form of a matrices product , @xmath56 with @xmath57 similarly , the transform of @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 where now @xmath60 upon taking the transpose of the rhs of  ( [ fpr ] ) it is seen that @xmath61 , provided that @xmath62 . but @xmath62 if and only if @xmath63 .",
    "this last relation is satisfied in all _ equilibrium _ processes , where it is known as _",
    "detailed balance_.    in the limit of slow processes , @xmath64 , hence @xmath65 .",
    "therefore @xmath62 ( even for nonequilibrium systems ) and the crooks relation @xmath2 is satisfied .",
    "as we discuss in the following the validity of crooks relation is much larger than what one would expect naively .",
    "in fact , there are large classes of nonequilibrium systems that obey this relation , and this despite their irreversibility and the violation of detailed balance .",
    "let us first consider a system with only two states , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "unless there is at least one transition ( say , from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) , the system is trivial and does not evolve at all .",
    "however , with only @xmath68 the steady state of the system is @xmath69 and the generalized entropy @xmath1 is not well defined .",
    "we therefore need consider only systems that include both transitions , @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "such systems , however , have an equilibrium state that obeys detailed balance , and therefore the crooks relation is satisfied for all ( relevant ) two - state systems .",
    "generally , irreversible processes with more than two states are not expected to obey the crooks relation .",
    "we now identify a wide class of such systems that does satisfy the crooks relation , despite their patent violation of detailed balance .",
    "these are characterized by the following theorem :    any system with states @xmath71 , such that all the transition rates @xmath72 are of the form @xmath73 , all the rates @xmath74 are of the form @xmath75 , the rates @xmath76 are @xmath77 , etc . , where all the @xmath78 s are _ constants _ and @xmath79 are driving parameters that are varied arbitrarily through the process duration , can be  coarse - grained \" into a system with states @xmath80 , where the  super - states \" @xmath81 are an aggregate of the states @xmath82 .",
    "the pdf s @xmath0 of the original system and the coarse - grained system are exactly the same .    for the special case where there are only two types of states , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ,",
    "the system is equivalent to a two - state coarse - grained system and the crooks relation is obeyed !    to prove the coarsening theorem we write down the rate equations , @xmath85 where @xmath86 now denotes the time - dependent probability for finding the system in state @xmath82 and the overdot denotes time differentiation . using @xmath87 , as postulated by the theorem s premise , and writing @xmath88 for all the various @xmath89-species , the equations become : @xmath90 we can now see that in the steady state , when the left side of the rate equations is set to 0 , the @xmath91 satisfy a homogeneous linear system of equations with constant coefficients and therefore they are constant ( independent of the driving fields @xmath92 ) .",
    "then , for states of type @xmath89 , the _ steady - state _ probability is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a normalization constant , determined by @xmath95 . note that while @xmath94 is a function of the driving fields , it has the very same value for _ all _ states ( of all types ) .",
    "recall now the expression for @xmath1 : @xmath96 the important thing is that in each @xmath97-factor there appears the same state @xmath98 ( both in the numerator and the denominator ) , therefore , from  ( [ rho_r ] ) , each such term depends only on the type of the state @xmath98 , but not on which particular one .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath99 is independent of @xmath100 .",
    "it follows that the _ spectrum _ of @xmath1 ( the possible values it attains ) depends only on the order that the different _ types _ of states are met : the paths @xmath101 have the same value of entropy , @xmath102 , for all @xmath103  the probability for having this particular value of entropy , @xmath104 , is given by the sum of all the pertinent path weights : @xmath105    consider now the coarse - grained system , where we associate all the states of one type with a single  super - state , \" @xmath81 , ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the probability that the system is initially in super - state @xmath89 is @xmath107 , while @xmath108 denotes the probability for being at super - state @xmath10 at step 3 , having followed the path @xmath109 ( and likewise for additional steps ) .",
    "the conclusion that the coarse - grained system has the same spectrum of @xmath1 and the same probabilities for each @xmath1 as the original system follows immediately .",
    "in this section we illustrate our results through the numerical study of some nonequilibrium reaction networks .",
    "the systems discussed in the following can be in various states , called @xmath110 , and the passage from one state to another takes place with a certain reaction rate .",
    "let us start with the simple case of a three - state system with the cyclic reaction scheme @xmath111 the rate equations are given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "the steady - state probabilities are readily shown to be @xmath114 , @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the rate equations can be integrated straightforwardly , yielding expressions for the time - dependent transition probabilities .",
    "for example , @xmath117 is obtained by using the initial condition @xmath118 and integrating to time @xmath119 . at constant values of the reaction rates",
    ", the system rapidly evolves towards the steady state .",
    "while detailed balance does not generally hold , the relation @xmath120 gets fulfilled as @xmath121 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we plot the detailed balance ratio @xmath122 as a function of time for fixed values @xmath123 and various values of @xmath124 .",
    "amusingly , the approach to stationarity is non - monotonous for @xmath125 .",
    "= 4.00 in     our focus in this paper is on situations where the reaction rates are not constant but are changed in time .",
    "the protocol that we use is the same as that discussed in the previous sections : some ( or all ) reaction rates are changed @xmath16 times over a total period of time @xmath13 , such that between two changes the rates are kept constant for a time interval of length @xmath126 .",
    "the transition probabilities between the different states can be found analytically for the simpler cases .",
    "for the more complex situations , we obtain these transition probabilities by numerically integrating the rate equations .",
    "once we have the transition probabilities , we can compute the probability distribution of @xmath1 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pphi ] ) and ( [ wpath ] ) .    as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] probability distributions obtained for our three - state model where one rate , namely @xmath124 , is increased from @xmath127 to @xmath128 in @xmath129 steps , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a . the probability distribution for this forward process",
    "is denoted by @xmath130 and the different curves correspond to different total times @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b we show the probability distribution @xmath131 for the reversed process where we start with @xmath128 and decrease that rate to @xmath127 in the same number of steps .",
    "= 4.50 in     looking at these probability distributions , the first thing one notices is their irregular structures for small times @xmath13 , characterized by pronounced peaks .",
    "these peaks become less and less prominent when @xmath13 increases , yielding a smooth distribution in the long - time limit . in addition , the distributions rapidly converge to a limiting curve when @xmath13 increases , and no notable changes in the shapes of the distributions are measured when @xmath13 exceeds 50 .    in order to verify the predictions of the previous sections ,",
    "we vary the reaction rates in different ways and compute the fluctuation ratio @xmath132 .",
    "some of our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . whereas in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a only the rate @xmath124 is changed , the rates @xmath133 and @xmath134 being constant , in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we vary all three rates in an independent way . the first case can be viewed as a simple example of a system that is equivalent to a two - state coarse - grained system ( the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be coarse - grained into a single state ) , see section  iii .",
    "consequently , we expect crooks relation @xmath135 to be fulfilled , independently of the length of the time interval . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , this is indeed the case .",
    "when all rates are varied independently , the system can not be replaced by an equivalent coarse - grained two - state system , and crooks relation does not hold , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b for @xmath136 . for very large @xmath13 , however , the process becomes slow , and crooks relation is then again recovered , in accordance with our discussion in section ii .",
    "= 4.50 in       = 3.00 in     in order to fully appreciate the coarse - graining procedure and the generality of our results , we study in the following the rather complex six - state system given in fig .",
    "inspection of that figure reveals that the processes that lead out of the states @xmath66 and @xmath137 depend only on the rate @xmath138 .",
    "similarly , processes out of the states @xmath67 and @xmath139 depend only on @xmath140 , and out of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , only on @xmath143 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath138 , @xmath143 and @xmath140 are varied independently , this six - state system should be equivalent to a three - state system , where the new states result from the union of pairs of the original states : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "if , in addition , we set @xmath147 , for example , we have only two independent variables , and our six - state process should be equivalent to a two - state system . whereas in the former case the detailed fluctuation theorem should be broken , in the latter case we should recover crooks relation even for our six - state system .",
    "= 4.50 in     we carefully checked that our original six - state model has indeed the same spectrum and probabilities for @xmath1 as the coarse - grained systems , in accordance with the theorem proven in section  iii . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we vary the three rates @xmath138 , @xmath140 , and @xmath143 independently . consequently , the six - state model can not be reduced to an equivalent two - state model and the crooks relation is not fulfilled .",
    "this is different for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where @xmath147 throughout the whole process .",
    "the six - state model can then be reduced to a coarse - grained two - state model and the crooks relation is fulfilled .",
    "understanding the properties of systems far from equilibrium is of great importance in many fields in physics .",
    "however , the challenges encountered in that endeavor remain extraordinary . in that context",
    ", the recent formulation of various fluctuation theorems , applicable either to systems in their steady states or to systems driven out of stationarity , constitutes an important development , as they allow a certain characterization and classification of various far from equilibrium systems .",
    "for that reason it is important to further probe these theorems , in order to better understand their range of applicability .    in this work we have focused on the hatano - sasa entropy @xmath1 , a quantity which reduces to the dissipative work in the special case of a system driven out of equilibrium , and that remains well defined even in the absence of microscopic reversibility .",
    "this entropy fulfills both an integral and a detailed fluctuation theorem for slow systems , i.e. , systems which reach the steady state after each change in the external parameters .",
    "most importantly , we show that for large classes of processes with many states one can find equivalent processes with fewer states that have the same spectrum of @xmath1 and the same probabilities for each @xmath1 . in the special case",
    "that this coarse - grained system is a two - state system , the original many - state process verifies crooks relation , and this even when detailed balance is broken due to the absence of microscopic reversibility .",
    "our results show that crooks detailed fluctuation theorem is much more widely applicable than thought previously , provided that the hatano - sasa entropy is used for characterizing the system .",
    "this opens the possibility to describe through fluctuation theorems wide classes of systems that have not been considered in that context previously .",
