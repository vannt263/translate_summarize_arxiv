    "_ kepler _ observations have led to a discovery that stellar flares representing impulsive powerful energy releases occur not only in m - type dwarfs ( uv ceti - type variables ) but also in a wide range of a - f type stars @xcite .",
    "previously , it was believed the f- and a - type stars do not have flaring activity .",
    "the discovery of super - flares on solar - type stars raised questions about the possibility of such flares on the sun .",
    "these results triggered new debates about the physical mechanism of stellar flares and the relationship to the dynamo mechanism .",
    "recent observations of solar flares from the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) have found that the white - light flares are often accompanied by excitation of acoustic oscillations ( p modes ) in the solar interior , so - called ` sunquakes ' . however , not all flares reveal the sunquakes",
    ". the relationship of the interior and atmospheric response to the energy release and optical emission is not understood , and is currently a subject of detailed studies in heliophysics .",
    "the flare - excited oscillations are mostly observed as local seismic waves , and while the theory predicts that the global acoustic waves are also excited , their amplitude is significantly lower than the amplitude of stochastically excited oscillations , therefore , the detection reports have been controversial .",
    "however , in the case of significantly more powerful stellar flares the impact on the star s surface is much greater .",
    "this can lead to excitation of the global low - degree oscillations to significantly higher amplitudes than on the sun .",
    "our preliminary study of the available short - cadence ( sc ) data provides indications of such ` starquakes ' .",
    "however , a statistical study for a large sample of stars and longer observing intervals are needed .",

    "recent observations of solar flares on the nasa space missions _ soho _ and _ sdo _ revealed that some flares result in excitation of acoustic oscillations in the solar interior , dubbed ` sunquakes ' .",
    "the oscillations are observed in the doppler shift and intensity variations as expanding circular waves ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "they are excited due to momentum and energy impulse in the solar photosphere , which is also observed in solar flares , but the mechanism of this impact is unknown .",
    "the expanding waves represent high - degree p modes ; however , the stellar oscillation theory predicts that the global low - degree modes are also excited .",
    "their detection has been reported from a statistical analysis of the correlation between the flare soft x - ray signals ( observed by the _ goes _ satellites ) and the total solar irradiance measurements from the space observatory _ soho _",
    "however , there was no unambiguous detection of the whole - sun oscillations caused by individual flare events .",
    "indeed , the oscillation theory predicts that the amplitudes of the low - degree modes of sunquakes are significantly lower than the amplitudes of stochastically excited oscillations ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) @xcite .",
    "the solar observations show that the sunquake events are mostly associated with compact or confined flares that do not produce coronal mass ejections and are characterized by the energy release in compact magnetic configurations in the lower atmosphere .",
    "such flares usually produce white - light or continuum optical emission , and they do not necessarily have strong x - ray emission . the origin of such flare energy release is mysterious , and the subject of intensive investigation .",
    "these flares and sunquakes challenge the standard ` thick - target ' flare model , which assumes that most of the flare energy is released in the form of high - energy particles due to magnetic reconnection processes in the coronal plasma .",
    "the particles travel along the magnetic field lines and heat the upper chromosphere to high temperature , creating a high - pressure region , which expands , producing a plasma eruption ( ` chromospheric evaporation ' ) and a downward - traveling radiative shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "this shock can reach the photosphere and excite acoustic oscillations .",
    "however , the numerical simulations of the flare hydrodynamics show that the energy of the shock may be not sufficient to explain the observed oscillations , and also the photospheric impact is often observed at the beginning of the flare impulsive phase or even during the pre - heating phase , well before the maximum of the hard and soft x - ray emissions that are supposedly produced by the particle interaction with the higher chromosphere .",
    "nevertheless , if a similar energy release mechanism works on other stars then the amplitudes of the flare - excited oscillations can be expected to be several orders of magnitude stronger than on the sun .    5  mhz @xcite ; ( b ) the signal of two large solar flares observed in the total irradiance measurements ( red channel ) with the spm instrument on the _ soho _ spacecraft .",
    "observations of stellar flares from _ kepler _ provide a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between the flare energy release and oscillations .",
    "the analysis of _ kepler _ data by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite has led to the discovery of a large number of flaring stars of various spectral classes , from m- to a - class .",
    "while large flares on m - k stars were known from ground - based observations , the discovery of similar flares on f - a stars is surprising .",
    "however , most of the flare data were obtained with long cadence , and do not provide sufficient resolution to estimate the flare amplitude and duration of the various phases of the energy release , or to investigate the seismic response of the stars . for understanding the mechanisms of flares and the impact of these flares , it is important to obtain more short - cadence data for flaring stars .    the previous _ kepler _ observations allowed us to select stars that showed multiple flares and with good quality oscillation data ( when short - cadence runs are available ) .",
    "we visually inspected the light curves of the previously detected flaring stars , as well as the database of the ground observations .",
    "the flare brightness signals observed by _ kepler _ ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) are much stronger than those on the sun ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "thus , the photospheric impacts can be much stronger , and the flare oscillations can be observed in the _ kepler _ data . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] we illustrate the potential detection of a ` starquake ' event obtained from the sc _",
    "kepler _ observations of kic 6106415 .",
    "the _ kepler _ light curve of this stellar flare is shown in panel ( a ) . the oscillation power spectrum calculated for a 2-day period immediately after the flare ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) shows an enhancement of the p - mode amplitudes at @xmath2  mhz , closer to the acoustic cut - off frequency for this star ( @xmath3  mhz ) , compared to the oscillation spectrum taken during the star s quiet period ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) , more than 5 days after the flare ( the so - called `` numax '' parameter at a frequency of @xmath4  mhz , e.g. , see chaplin et al . , 2013 )",
    "of course , more statistical studies are needed to confirm this result .",
    "oscillations associated with stellar flares have previously been observed in optical and x - ray emissions with periods ranging from a few seconds to tens of minutes , and have usually been interpreted as transient oscillations of flaring loops in stellar atmospheres @xcite .",
    "however , the atmospheric transient oscillations quickly decay , within 1 - 2 hours after a flare impulse @xcite , while the stellar oscillation modes will live for much longer , depending on the damping mechanism in stellar envelopes .",
    "also , the maximum amplitude of the oscillations modes excited by flares is expected to be in the range of 3 - 20 min , close to the cut - off period of acoustic oscillations .",
    "we can not rule out that oscillations with longer periods , corresponding to g modes and mixed modes , are also excited .",
    "nevertheless , we plan the initial search for the flare seismic responses in the frequency range around the acoustic cut - off frequency .",
    "the initial results from the _ kepler _ mission have demonstrated its tremendous capability for studying stellar activity and oscillations . in particular , the previous observing programs have discovered that flares , during which stellar brightness dramatically increases for short periods of time , are common in both cool and hot stars .",
    "previously , stellar flares were associated with active m - type stars , the uv ceti variables , thought to be similar to solar flares , which represent a sudden release of magnetic energy accumulated in the coronal part of sunspot regions in the form of high - energy particles , which heat the lower atmosphere .",
    "however , the white - light emission in solar flares is rare , and there are only few cases when it has been unambiguously observed in the intergrated sun - as - a - star observations .",
    "the stellar flares can be four orders - of - magnitude more powerful .",
    "this might be due to bigger sunspot regions generated by a more efficient dynamo process , because many of the flaring stars rotate faster than the sun .",
    "however , there is an alternative point of view that the flares may be due to interactions with close companions , ` hot jupiters ' .",
    "the discovery of similar flares on hot a - type stars with a very shallow outer convection zone and without strong magnetic fields @xcite raises additional problems with the dynamo origin of the flare energy ."
