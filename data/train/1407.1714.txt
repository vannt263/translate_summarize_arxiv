    "the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) shows a hemispherical power anisotropy @xcite , which can be parametrized as , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an isotropic and gaussian random field , @xmath2 the preferred direction and @xmath3 the amplitude of anisotropy .",
    "this model implies a dipole modulation @xcite of the cmbr temperature field .",
    "the wmap five year data leads to @xmath4 with the dipole direction , @xmath5 for @xmath6 in the galactic coordinates @xcite . this anisotropy has been confirmed by planck @xcite with amplitude and direction similar to those found in wmap .",
    "the hemispherical anisotropy has also been probed at multipoles higher than @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the signal is found to be absent at @xmath8 @xcite and also not seen in the large scale structures @xcite .",
    "these observations may be accommodated in a model which proposes a scale dependent power spectrum @xcite , such that the effect is negligible at high@xmath9 .",
    "many theoretical models , such as , @xcite , have been proposed which aim to explain the observed hemispherical anisotropy as well as other signals of anisotropy seen in data @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility is that there might have been a phase of anisotropic expansion at very early time .",
    "the inflationary big bang cosmology is perfectly consistent with such an evolution .",
    "the anisotropic modes , generated during this early phase may later re - enter the horizon @xcite and lead to the observed signals .    in this paper our objective is to determine a primordial power spectrum which may lead to dipole modulation and hence hemispherical anisotropy .",
    "it is possible to find a power spectrum based on an inhomogeneous model @xcite which is consistent @xcite with the observed temperature anisotropy .",
    "however it is not clear how an anisotropic model might lead to a dipole modulation .",
    "the simplest model that one might construct leads to quadrupolar and not dipolar modulation @xcite .",
    "the basic problem can be understood by considering the two point correlations in real space .",
    "let @xmath10 be the density fluctuations in real space .",
    "their two point correlation function , @xmath11 , may be expressed as , @xmath12 where , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in a correlation which is anisotropic and hence depends on @xmath15 besides the magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "it is clear from the definition of the correlation function that , in a classical framework , it must satisfy , @xmath17 hence it can only be an even function of @xmath15 .",
    "the simplest anisotropic function is , therefore , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are parameters .",
    "it is clear that such a model can not give rise to a dipole modulation , which requires a term linear in @xmath21 .    in this paper",
    "we argue that in a noncommutative space - time , a term linear in @xmath21 is permissible .",
    "the power spectrum that we are interested in is applicable at very early time , perhaps even the time when quantum gravity effects were not negligible . at that time",
    ", we can not assume that space - time is commutative @xcite .",
    "its noncommutativity may be expressed as , @xmath22 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{eq : basiccommutator}\\ ] ] where , @xmath23 are parameters and the coordinate functions , @xmath24 , depend on the choice of coordinate system . in a particular coordinate system",
    ", we may set , @xmath25 in @xcite the authors assume that this prefered system is the comoving coordinate system . in general",
    ", the noncommutativity can appear quite complicated in different systems .",
    "the effect of noncommutativity on cosmology has been considered earlier @xcite .",
    "however its relationship with dipole modulation has not been pointed out so far .    in @xcite",
    ", we have determined the power spectrum corresponding to an inhomogeneous model and shown that its spectral index is consistent with zero . in the present paper we determine the power spectrum of an anisotropic model based on noncommutative space - time .",
    "in this section we review the correlations between different multipoles which are induced by the dipole modulation model , eq .",

    "we assume an approximate form of the transfer function , @xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath44 is the spherical bessel function .",

    "we do nt confine ourselves to a particular model and instead extract the anisotropic power directly from data . for this purpose , we assume the following parametrization of @xmath61 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are parameters .",

    "this allows us to obtain the theoretical prediction of the statistic , @xmath89 , which can be compared to to @xmath36 in order to determine the best fit value of power spectrum parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we use the cleaned cmb map , ilc , based on wmap 9 year data @xcite ( hereafter wilc9 ) and smica , provided by the planck team @xcite .",
    "we use the kq85 and cmb - union mask in order to eliminate foreground contaminated regions for the wmap and planck data respectively .",

    "this data map is downgraded to a lower resolution with @xmath92 after applying appropriate gaussian beam to smooth the mask boundary @xcite . hence any breaks that might be introduced at the boundary of the masked region get eliminated .",
    "we also use the smica in - painted map , in which the in - painting procedure @xcite has been used to reconstruct the masked regions , provided by the planck team .    in order to determine the power spectrum parameters",

    "we find it convenient to fix the direction parameters to be same as those obtained over the entire multipole range .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these show some dependence on the multipole bin , but the dependence is relatively mild and we ignore it for present analysis .",
    "for the entire multipole range , @xmath94 the best fit value of @xmath77 is found to be , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for wilc9 and smica respectively .",
    "here we have assumed that the spectral index @xmath93 .",
    "hence the function , @xmath61 is equal to a constant , @xmath77 .",
    "we have verified that the results obtained for the case of the smica in - painted map are in good agreement with those for smica and wilc9 .",
    "we next extract the function , @xmath61 , using data in the three multipole bins , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we parametrize it in terms of @xmath77 and the spectral index @xmath78 . setting @xmath93 ,",
    "the best fit value of @xmath77 is found to be , @xmath101 with @xmath102 for wilc9 and @xmath103 with @xmath104 for smica .",

    "we show that an anisotropic power spectrum model , derived on the basis of noncommutative geometry provides a description of the observed hemispherical anisotropy .",
