    "non - extensive statistics is by now recognized as a new paradigm for statistical mechanical consideration @xcite .",
    "it revolves around the concept of tsallis s information - entropy measure @xmath1 , a generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy , that depends on a real parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter , which is called entropic index , characterizes the degree of extensivity of the system .",
    "if the system is composed of two independent systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that the probability @xmath4 the entropy of the total system is given by the following pseudo - extensive relation @xmath5 from which the denunciation non - extensive comes .",
    "tsallis s entropy becomes shannon s measure for the particular value @xmath6 .",
    "bgs entropy is the natural entropy for modelling chaotic dynamics that suffer from exponential sensitivity to initial condition , having at least one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "tsallis statistics provide possible way  to describe non - integrable systems when the sensitivity to the initial conditions diverges less than exponentially .",
    "this has been demonstrated by studying a great variety of systems . among them",
    "is the logistic map @xcite , which have been used since more than two decades to demonstrate various routes to chaos @xcite .",
    "quantum chaotic systems are known to be described in terms of the random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "it models a chaotic system by an ensemble of random hamiltonian matrices @xmath7 that belong to one of the three universal classes , orthogonal , unitary and symplectic .",
    "the gaussian probability density distribution of the matrix elements @xmath8 $ ] is obtained by maximizing bgs entropy @xcite .",
    "a complete discussion of the level correlations even for these three canonical ensemble is a difficult task .",
    "most of the interesting results are obtained for the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "analytical results have long ago been obtained for the case of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it yields simple analytical expressions for the nearest - neighbor - spacing ( nns ) @xmath11 , renormalized to make the mean spacing equal one .",
    "the spacing distribution for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , @xmath12 , is known as wigner s surmise .",
    "it is obtained by imposing the requirement of being invariant with respect to the base transformation @xcite .",
    "analogous expression are obtained for the gaussian unitary and symplectic ensembles ( gue and gse ) , respectively @xcite , and given here below .",
    "these expressions have been successfully applied to the nns of various chaotic systems . on the other hand ,",
    "there are elaborate theoretical arguments by berry and tabor @xcite that nns of classically integrable systems should have a poissonian statistics .",
    "the poisson distribution @xmath13  of the regular spectra has been proved in some cases ( see , results by sinai @xcite and marklof @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "still its mechanism is not completely understood .",
    "it has also been confirmed by many numerical studies , e.g. @xcite , so that the appearance of the poisson distribution is now admitted as a universal phenomenon in generic integrable quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that not all the regular systems have a poissonian nns  distribution .",
    "the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator is a classical example @xcite . in this case ,",
    "numerical calculations show the nns distribution vanishes everywhere except in a narrow region centered at @xmath14 .",
    "this suggests that the spectrum has nearly a picket - fence shape .    in this work",
    ", we suggest that the non - extensive generalization to rmt provides a principled way to accommodate systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "we use the maximum entropy principle , with tsallis entropy , to obtain the distribution functions for random - matrix ensembles belonging to the three canonical symmetry universalities .",
    "the tsallis entropy is defined for the continuous variables entering the hamiltonian matrix @xmath7 by @xmath15 = \\frac{1-\\int dh\\left [ p_{\\beta } ( q , h)% \\right ] ^{q}}{q-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 while @xmath17 and 4 for the hamiltonians having orthogonal , unitary or symplectic symmetries .",
    "we shall refer to the corresponding ensembles as the tsallis orthogonal ensemble ( tsoe ) , the tsallis unitary ensemble ( tsue ) , and the tsallis symplectic ensemble ( tsse ) . for @xmath18 , @xmath19tends to bgs entropy @xmath20 = -\\int dhp_{\\beta } ( q , h)\\ln p_{\\beta } ( q , h)$ ] , which yields the gaussian ensembles @xcite .",
    "there are more than one formulation of non - extensive statistics which mainly differ in the definition of the averaging .",
    "some of them are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we apply the most recent formulation @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath21  is obtained by maximizing the entropy under two conditions , @xmath22 ^{q}\\text{tr}\\left ( h^{\\dagger } h\\right ) } { \\int dh\\left [ p_{\\beta } ( q , h)\\right ] ^{q } } & = & \\sigma _ { \\beta } ^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a constant .",

    "we now calculate the joint probability density for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath7 . with @xmath33 , where @xmath34  is the global unitary group . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the elements of the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath35 diag@xmath36 of the eigenvalues and the independent elements of @xmath34 as new variables . then the volume element ( 3 )",
    "has the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the vandermonde determinant and @xmath39 the invariant haar measure of the unitary group @xcite . in terms of the new variables ,",
    "tr@xmath40 so that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) is independent of the  angular  variables in @xmath34 .  integrating ( 6 ) over @xmath41 yields the joint probability density of eigenvalues in the form @xmath42 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a normalization constant .",
    "this formula is the main result of the proposed nonextensive generalization of rmt and , to our knowledge , the eigenvalue distribution functions has never been expressed in this form before . in the limit of @xmath6",
    ", it reduces to eigenvalue distribution functions obtained in the rmt and used for further investigation of the gaussian ensembles .",
    "analytical expressions for the nearest - neighbor spacing ( nns ) distribution can be obtained for the @xmath44 matrix ensembles . for the gaussian ensembles , this approach leads to the well - known wigner surmises @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for goe , gue , and gse , respectively .",
    "they present accurate approximation to the exact results for the case of @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the non - extensive generalization of the wigner surmises , hoping that the results present a reasonable approximation to the physically interesting cases of large @xmath50 , as they do well in the case of gaussian ensembles .",
    "we rewrite eq .",

    "the figure shows that distributions ( 16 ) evolve the shape predicted by the corresponding wigner surmise towards the poisson distribution , but never reach it .",
    "the limiting distributions are @xmath82 which all tend to @xmath83 as @xmath84 . recalling the results obtained for the logistic map @xcite",
    ", we may consider these distributions as signaling the edge of chaos where the lyapunov exponents vanish .",
    "the tsallis statistics can not be extended to more regular regimes probably because the degree of mixing then does not justify the use of the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "now we consider the case of @xmath85 .",
    "for this case , the distribution ( 9 ) has to be complemented by the auxiliary condition that the quantity inside the square bracket has to be positive .",

    "the limiting distributions are @xmath92 these distributions have their peaks at @xmath93 as that of the picket - fence distribution , but their widths are not small .",
    "in summary , the nns distribution obtained from applying tsallis statistics to rmt maps two routes for the transition from chaos to order .",
    "one leads towards the integrability described by the poisson statistics by increasing @xmath94 , but ends at the edge of chaos .",
