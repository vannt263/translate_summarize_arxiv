    "conductive polymers  @xcite have received much attention due to its extensive industrial applications ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , such as in nonlinear optical waveguides , vapor - phase detectors , twisted nematic liquid crystal displays , and so on . in fact",
    ", the conductive organic polymers  @xcite can be formulated with polymers that incorporate conductive additives such as carbon black  @xcite or fine dispersed metallic particles  @xcite .",
    "this is because the presence of certain additives in the polymer can enhance the effective electrical conductivity . in particular , recently organic polymer composites filled with conductive metallic particles received much attention in scientific research  @xcite .",
    "for such polymer composites , their electrical characteristic are close to that of metals , whereas the mechanical property and processing method are typical for plastics  @xcite .",
    "the effective electrical conductivity of metal - polymer composite should depend on the conductivity of particles , the particle shape , the volume fraction of particles , and the spatial orientation or alignment of particles in the composite",
    ".    ferrogels  @xcite are a new class of magneto - controlled elastic materials , which are chemically cross - linked polymer networks swollen with a ferrofluid .",
    "a ferrofluid  @xcite is a colloidal dispersion of monodomain ferromagnetic particles . in the ferrogel",
    ", the finely distributed magnetic particles are located in the swelling liquid and attached to the flexible network chains by adhesive forces . in the absence of an applied field the magnetic moments are randomly oriented , and thus the gel has no net magnetization .",
    "if an external field is applied , the magnetic moments tend to align with the field , thus yielding a bulk magnetic moment . in case of ordinary field strengths ,",
    "the tendency of the dipole moments to align with the applied field is partially overcome by thermal agitation . as the strength of field increases",
    ", all the particles eventually align their moments along the direction of the field , and as a result , the magnetization saturates .",
    "if the field is turned off , the magnetic dipole moments quickly randomize and thus the bulk magnetization is again reduced to zero . in a zero magnetic field",
    "a ferrogel presents a mechanical behavior very close to that of a swollen network filled with non - magnetic colloidal particles . in uniform magnetic fields a ferrogel experiences no net force , and hence no macroscopic shape changes and motion",
    "are observed .",
    "ferrogels have much application ranging from soft actuators , micromanipulators , and artificial muscles  @xcite , to cancer therapy  @xcite or as an apparatus for immunoblotting  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy is a common phenomenon in most materials , and it can be an intrinsic material property or induced by the application of fields . also , in real applications , the shape of particles may deviate from a perfect spherical shape during fabrication . in ferrogels , due to the anisotropic particle shape and/or conductivity of the ferromagnetic particles , the specific spatial orientation of the particles",
    "can be realized by using an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , the electric properties of ferrogels can be controlled by reorientation of the particles in an applied magnetic field .    in this paper , we shall focus on an anisotropic ferrogel in which both the particle shape and conductivity possess a tensorial form .",
    "our aim is to study the effects of the shape and/or material ( conductivity ) anisotropy on the effective electrical conductivity of the ferrogel , by taking into account the spatial orientation of the particles , which can be affected by the external magnetic field . to this end , we find both the shape anisotropy and the external magnetic field can cause the effective electrical conductivity to increase .",
    "furthermore , the material ( conductivity ) anisotropy can increase the effective electrical conductivity significantly .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we put forth a general model for a ferrogel containing ellipsoidal ferromagnetic particles with anisotropic conductivity . in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically calculate two cases , namely , spherical particles with anisotropic conductivity , and spheroidal particles with isotropic conductivity , in an attempt to focus on the influence of the shape and material anisotropy , respectively .",
    "this paper ends with a discussion and conclusion in sec .",
    "let us start by considering an ellipsoidal particle with depolarization factors @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 along @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 axes , respectively .",
    "namely , the depolarization factor has a tensor form = (    ccc l_x & 0 & 0 + 0 & l_y & 0 + 0 & 0 & l_z    ) .",
    "the three components satisfy a sum rule , @xmath6  @xcite . in the case of crystalline anisotropic",
    ", the conductivity of the particle has a tensor form as @xmath7 the particles are embedded in a host with a scalar conductivity @xmath8 in this paper , the principle axes of @xmath9 are assumed to be parallel to the geometric axes of the ellipsoidal particle .",
    "the orientation of the conductivity tensor @xmath9 differs from inclusion to inclusion , such that @xmath9 is transformed to _ 1 = _ 1^t in a common coordinate system , where @xmath10 denotes the rotation matrix of a particle . for the volume average of the field of the whole system @xmath11 , one has  @xcite p_1 + ( 1-p ) _",
    "l= , [ ae0 ] where @xmath12 stands for the volume fraction of particles , and @xmath11 is equal to the applied field @xmath13 under appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes the volume average of @xmath15 @xmath16 represents the volume average of the lorentz field ( namely , local field in the vicinity of the particles ) which includes the contribution from the dipole moments of all the other particles , and @xmath17 represents the volume average of the local field inside the particles .",
    "thus , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ae0 ] ) as  @xcite p_1 + ( 1-p ) _ l= _ 0,[ae ] solving the electrostatic equation @xmath18 ( @xmath19 denotes the electrical potential inside the particles ) , we obtain @xmath17 such that  @xcite _ 1= _ l[ae1 ] with = ^t . here",
    "= (    ccc & 0 & 0 + 0 & & 0 + 0 & 0 &    ) .",
    "on the other hand , we average the electric current density @xmath20 over the volume of the whole system , and obtain = p_1_1 + ( 1-p)_2 _ l.[aj ] further , the effective electrical conductivity @xmath21 of the ferrogel can be defined as _",
    "e = = . in view of eqs .",
    "( [ ae ] ) ,  ( [ ae1 ] )  and  ( [ aj ] ) , we obtain _ e = , [ eff ] which can be expressed in a tensorial form such that _ e = (    ccc _ e11 & 0 & 0 + 0 & _ e22 & 0 + 0 & 0 & _",
    "e33    ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) , @xmath22 represents a unit matrix .",
    "( [ eff ] ) is a nontrivial equation , which can reproduce many other known results .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and seeing the particles _ randomly _ oriented in a host , @xmath25 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) is identical to eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , if the metallic particles are subjected to an external magnetic field ( i.e. , no longer randomly oriented ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) are identical to eqs .",
    "( 3 )  and  ( 4 ) of ref .  @xcite , respectively . finally , for spherical particles ( namely , @xmath28 ) with a scalar conductivity ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) can produce the expression for the well - known maxwell garnett theory  @xcite , namely _",
    "e = _ 2 + .",
    "we are now in a position to do some numerical calculations .",
    "we shall discuss two cases : ( case i ) spherical particle with tensorial conductivity ; ( case ii ) ellipsoidal particle with scalar conductivity .",
    "in doing so , we can focus on the effect of shape or material ( conductivity ) anisotropies , respectively .",
    "to start , we have to derive the expression for @xmath29 . for @xmath23 and @xmath30 , @xmath29 can be obtained as  @xcite = (    ccc [ _ 11+_33-(_33-_11 ) ] & 0 & 0 + 0 & [ _ 22+_33-(_33-_22 ) ] & 0 + 0 & 0 & _",
    "11+(_33-_11 )    ) , where @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the polar orientation angel of a particle , @xmath33 . since the orientation of the ferromagnetic particles in ferrogels can be affected by the external magnetic field , there is @xmath34  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 denotes the langevin function and @xmath36 the langevin parameter , where @xmath37 represents the magnetic moment of a particle , and @xmath38 the magnetic field , @xmath39 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath40 the temperature . for the sake of convenience , @xmath41 will be used to denote the magnetic field in the following numerical calculations . in a word , @xmath42 contains the information of the spatial orientation of the particles in the host . in particular , the zero field ( @xmath43 ) yields @xmath44 naturally due to the random orientation of the particles . as @xmath45 @xmath42 deviates from @xmath46 accordingly . in other words , the specific spatial orientation of the particles in the ferrogel",
    "can be achieved by adjusting the external magnetic field .      in this case",
    ", there are @xmath47 and @xmath30 . in fig .  1 , we display the effective electrical conductivity versus the langevin parameter for different conductivity ratio @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 represents the degree of anisotropy of conductivity .",
    "we find increasing the langevin parameter @xmath41 causes @xmath25 to decrease , see fig .",
    "1(a)-(b ) .",
    "in contrast , in fig .",
    "1(c)-(d ) , as @xmath41 increases , @xmath27 increases first , and decreases after a peak .",
    "in particular , at @xmath50 there is always a peak for @xmath51 $ ] . in detail , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , the corresponding peak values are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "an optimal magnetic field exists which leads to a maximum conductivity @xmath27 .",
    "it is worth noting that both @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is a number ) can predict the same @xmath25 or @xmath27 concerned , see fig .",
    "1(b )  and  ( d ) .",
    "this behavior keeps unchanged up to @xmath61 or so .",
    "moreover , larger @xmath60 and hence a stronger conductivity anisotropy can lead to a higher effective electrical conductivity @xmath25 or @xmath27 .      for this case , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "2 shows the effective electrical conductivity against the langevin parameter @xmath41 for different depolarization factor @xmath2 . for prolate spheroidal particles ( @xmath62 )",
    ", smaller @xmath2 can lead to higher @xmath25 or @xmath27 , see fig .  2 .",
    "in contrast , for oblate spheroidal particles ( @xmath63 ) , larger @xmath2 can yield higher @xmath25 or lower @xmath27 .",
    "also , for the prolate spheroidal cases , increasing the magnetic field causes @xmath25 ( or @xmath27 ) to decrease ( or increase ) .",
    "however , for the oblate spheroidal cases , as the magnetic field increases , @xmath25 increases , but @xmath27 decreases . in a word , the stronger shape anisotropy ( namely ,",
    "how @xmath2 deviates from @xmath46 ) can yield a higher effective electrical conductivity .    from cases",
    "i  and  ii , it is concluded that material ( conductivity ) anisotropies are more important to yield higher effective electrical conductivities of ferrogels than shape anisotropies , while magnetic fields can offer a correction .",
    "in addition , we also discussed the effect of the volume fraction of particles ( no figures shown here ) .",
    "it is shown that increasing the volume fraction of particles can cause the effective electrical conductivity to increase accordingly .",
    "this result is the same as that obtained by xue  @xcite .",
    "here some comments are in order . in this paper , we have presented a general model for a ferrogel in which both the particle shape and conductivity have a tensorial form , in an attempt to study the effect of the shape and/or material ( conductivity ) anisotropy on the effective electrical conductivity of the ferrogel , by taking into account the spatial orientation of the particles in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "our theory reproduced several known results , and provides a link between the particle property and orientation distribution and the effective electrical conductivity of ferrogels .    for water ,",
    "the minerals like sodium chloride are often dissolved in it , thus making it have a conductivity .",
    "more importantly , as one tries to make pure water by gradually removing electrolytes , its conductivity gradually decreases indeed .",
    "however , if all electrolytes are removed , its conductivity is still nonzero .",
    "the reason is that an infinitesimal part of the molecules of water  only about one in 500 million  is ionized as hydrogen ions ( h@xmath64 ) and hydroxide ions ( oh@xmath65 ) .",
    "theoretically , at this point , the conductivity becomes @xmath66s / m at @xmath67@xmath68c .",
    "in contrast , the conductivity of polymers could be @xmath69s / m . for the ferrogel discussed in this paper",
    ", we see the ferromagnetic particles to be embedded in the host medium which is composed of polymers as well as water .    since the structure and magnetization property of a polydisperse ferrogel can differ from that of a monodisperse system  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to extend the present work to polydisperse case , so that one could investigate the polydisperse effect on the effective electrical conductivity of polydisperse ferrogels .    in this work , we derived an anisotropic maxwell - garnett formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) ] , which is nonsymmetrical and may thus be suitable for low concentrations .",
    "for a higher concentration of particles , we can derive an alternative anisotropic bruggeman formula ( see appendix ) , which is symmetrical .",
    "similar results should be obtained by means of the anisotropic bruggeman formula .",
    "however , the bruggeman formula can predict a percolation threshold .",
    "it is also interesting to see what happens if one extend the present model to investigate the electro - optical effects  @xcite , nonlinearity enhancement  @xcite , figure of merit  @xcite , and nonlinear ac responses  @xcite of ferrogels due to the presence of the ( weak ) nonlinearity inside the metallic particles . in doing so , the particle reorientation arising from external magnetic fields",
    "is expected to play a role as well .",
    "in addition , due to the analogy of the mathematical form between conductivities and dielectric constants of composite materials , it is straightforward to apply the present theory to the effective dielectric constant of ferrogels .    to sum up , based on our general model , it was shown that material ( conductivity ) anisotropies are more important to produce a high effective electrical conductivity of ferrogels than shape anisotropies , while magnetic fields can offer a correction due to the change in orientation distributions of particles .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( german research foundation ) under grant no .",
    "ho 1108/8 - 3 . i would like to thank dr . c. holm and professor h. pleiner for their critical comments , and professor k. w. yu for fruitful discussions .",
    "to derive the anisotropic bruggeman formula , let us start from the effective dipole factor of the two components in the system .",
    "for the particles , the dipole factor @xmath70 is _ 1 = (      ) .",
    "on the other hand , the host have a dipole factor @xmath71 such that _ 2 = .",
    "now we can derive the bruggeman formula by considering the fact that the effective dipole factor @xmath72 of the whole system should be zero , and then obtain p_1 + ( 1-p)_2 = 0,[bru ] where @xmath73 . in case of @xmath28 and @xmath24 ( scalar conductivity ) , eq .",
    "( [ bru ] ) reduces to the well - know ( isotropic ) bruggeman formula p + ( 1-p ) = 0 ."
