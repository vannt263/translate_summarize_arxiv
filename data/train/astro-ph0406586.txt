    "the highest frequencies modulating the x - ray flux observed from accreting neutron stars and black holes continue to attract attention because their values are as high as those of orbital frequencies close to the neutron star surface or to the circular photon orbit around a black hole .",
    "the origin of the modulations , known as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) because they are not quite coherent , still remains a major puzzle ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) .",
    "typically these qpos come in pairs , with the higher frequency ( as high as 1.2 khz for neutron stars and 0.5 khz for black holes ) larger by about 50% than the lower frequency of the pair .",
    "it has been recognized for some time that the hf qpos may correspond to accretion disk oscillations not present in newtonian @xmath0 gravity , e.g. , modes trapped close to the maximum of the epicyclic frequency ( wagoner 1999 , kato 2001 ) .",
    "non - axisymmetric modes have been preferred , as it was thought that a considerable degree of non - axisymmetry is a necessary condition for modulating the x - rays .",
    "it has also been suggested that the hf qpo phenomenon is caused by a non - linear resonance between two modes of oscillation of the accretion disk or torus ( kluniak & abramowicz 2001 , abramowicz & kluniak 2001 ) . in a resonance",
    ", there should be a rational ratio of frequencies , and indeed the observed pairs of high - frequency qpos in black holes are in a 3:2 ratio ( mcclintock and remillard 2003 ) .",
    "more recently , it has been specifically suggested that the higher frequency corresponds to vertical oscillations of the accretion disk / torus occuring at the meridional epicyclic frequency ( kluniak & abramowicz 2002 , 2003 ; kluniak et al .",
    "2004 ; lee , abramowicz & kluniak 2004 ) .",
    "however , the mechanism of x - ray modulation remained a puzzle .    here ,",
    "we show that gravitational lensing of the photon trajectories in schwarzschild metric suffices to appreciably modulate the flux observed at infinity even if the source is symmetric about the axis of a black hole , provided that it moves parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "specifically , we show that a toroidal source oscillating about the equatorial plane of the black hole , but otherwise steady , gives rise to a periodically modulated flux .",
    "if , in addition , the source is strongly variable at another frequency , the flux will strongly vary at two frequencies , with the power ratio depending on the inclination angle of the observer .",
    "in order to compute the amount of radiation coming from the source we have developed a  new three - dimensional ray - tracing code . following the method used by rauch  & blandford ( 1994 ) we integrate geodesic and geodesic deviation equations in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "photon trajectories are integrated backward in time from the observer positioned at infinity at some inclination angle  @xmath1 with respect to the  @xmath2 axis . at certain points along the trajectory",
    "the current position , momentum , time delay and magnification are recorded .",
    "this information is then used to reconstruct each photon s path and calculate the total amount of incoming radiation .",
    "the intensity observed at infinity is an  integration of the  emissivity @xmath3 over the  path length along geodesics and it can be written down as @xmath4 the integration is along the  light ray parametrized by an  affine parameter @xmath5 .",
    "here , @xmath6 is the  time component of photon s , @xmath7 is the   factor and @xmath8 is the  photon time delay .",
    "we consider an isolated , luminous , optically thin and geometrically slender torus around a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath9 . in this problem , all radii scale with @xmath9 ( we use @xmath10 ) , and all frequencies scale as @xmath11 . for a convenient comparison with the observed frequencies we chose @xmath12 .    the torus is assumed to be circular in cross - section and to oscillate harmonically parallel to its axis . in sections 4 and 5 , we allow the same torus to execute radial oscillations as well .",
    "the circle of its maximum pressure is at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in cylindrical co - ordinates related to the schwarzschild co - ordinates through @xmath15 . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the vertical epicyclic frequency , in schwarzschild geometry equal to the keplerian orbital frequency .",
    "the amplitude of vertical motion is @xmath17 .",
    "the intrinsic emissivity per unit co - moving volume of the torus is held constant in time , as is its cross - sectional radius @xmath18 .    in this _ section _ , the only time variation of the torus is in its vertical position .",
    "we find that in spite of this , the flux observed at infinity clearly varies at the oscillation frequency ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is caused by relativistic effects at the source ( lensing and beaming ) , and no other cause need be invoked to explain in principle the highest - frequency modulation of x - rays in luminous black - hole binary sources .",
    "now consider radial oscillations of the torus under discussion . keeping the cross - sectional radius @xmath19 fixed we allow the central circle of the torus to vary as @xmath20",
    "simultaneously with @xmath21 this results in a periodic change of volume of the torus .",
    "because the optically thin torus is assumed to be filled with a polytropic gas radiating by bremsstrahlung cooling , there is a corresponding change of luminosity , with a clear periodicity at @xmath22 . with our choice of @xmath23",
    ", we have @xmath24",
    ".    the luminosity variations will depend on the properties of the torus .",
    "we take the emissivity in the local frame to be @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are polytropic index , molecular weight , atomic mass unit and the  boltzmann constant , respectively . to approximate the properties of an oscillating torus",
    ", we actually took the equipotential structure obtained by taylor expanding in the @xmath31 direction equilibrium solutions of the relativistic euler equation ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1978 ) of a torus with uniform angular momentum @xmath32 , so that @xmath33^{{1}/{\\gamma-1}}$ ] , and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the net effect is best displayed as the power spectrum at infinity of a flux of photons propagating in minkowski space , i.e. , one obtained neglecting the relativistic effects responsible for modulating the flux at the vertical epicyclic frequency .",
    "the resulting power spectrum of a torus oscillating with amplitudes @xmath35 about a newtonian point mass @xmath9 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we have computed the light trajectories for several inclination angles in schwarzschild geometry for the oscillating torus described in section  4 . in all cases ,",
    "two strong periodic components are clearly seen in the light curves and in the power spectra , at the two oscillation frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the relative power in the two components depends on the inclination angle and the amplitude of oscillation ( figs . 3 , 4 ) .",
    "[ big ]     [ small ]",
    "we have shown that gravitational lensing at the source will modulate the flux received at infinity from an axially symmetric emitter oscillating about the equatorial plane of a black hole .",
    "we also find , that in a torus executing simultaneous oscillations in the radial and vertical directions at frequencies @xmath36 , and @xmath38 , as expected in the parametric resonance model ( kluniak and abramowicz 2002 ) , both frequencies will show up in the power spectrum , with no other ( e.g. , harmonic ) strong components .",
    "the lower of the frequencies may reflect changes in the emissivity of the torus , but the presence of the upper frequency is explained by effects of relativity alone .",
    "strong - field gravity may thus have two signatures in the observed fast variability of black hole emission .",
    "first , it is responsible for the presence of two frequencies @xmath39 , where in newtonian gravity there is only one ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "second , it is responsible for modulation of the light curve ( figs .",
    "3,4 ) , where in newtonian gravity there was none at the frequency of the vertical oscillations ( fig .  2 ) .",
