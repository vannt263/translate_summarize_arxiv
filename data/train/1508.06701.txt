    "such solutions may violate the important theorems of hawking - penrose and avoid the problem of singularities .    in bardeen @xcite ,",
    "one has the first regular black hole ( rbh ) : a compact object with an event horizon and without a physical singularity ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for a short introduction ) .",
    "this realization is a consequence of ideas from sakharov and others @xcite that the spacetime inside the horizon , where the matter has a high pressure , is de sitter - like .",
    "the bardeen solution is spherically symmetric and does not violate the weak energy condition ( wec ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is formed by a nonlinear electrodynamic field .",
    "decades later , hayward @xcite constructed another regular solution with this symmetry . on the other hand , recently , solutions with axial symmetry ( bhs with rotation ) have been developed as well @xcite . in our work @xcite ,",

    "our solution generalizes previous works because adopts the cosmological constant , axial symmetry and the general mass term ( [ mass_term ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that the wec is always violated when the rotation is present .    a general approach to build solutions in gr and brane world contexts using linear constraints in the energy - momentum tensor is presented in @xcite . from known solutions ( such as schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm etc . )",
    "it is possible to construct metrics deforming the standard solutions . according to the constraint",

    "@xcite ( such an approach has been useful to generate spherical rbhs in a brane world .",
