    "meshless methods have recently emerged as numerical techniques for electromagnetic modelling @xcite .",
    "these methods do not require a predefined mesh , and use points scattered in the problem domain avoiding the need of information on the position among them .",
    "one of the most popular meshless method , the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) @xcite has been recently reformulated by the authors for computational electromagnetics ( cem ) problems .",
    "maxwell s equations , which relate the electric and magnetic fields by means of a time dependent system of partial differential equations(pdes ) are considered @xcite . due to the coupling nature of the electric and magnetic field components , the points are in such a way that the electric points should be surrounded by those of magnetic field and vice - versa .",
    "the method named as spem is applied in approximating the space field variables of the time domain maxwell s curl equations by using a kernel representation working with a cluster of scattered nodes .",
    "the differential operators applied to the field variables are transmitted to a kernel function which characterizes the spatial discretization . despite the good spatial properties of spem , the numerical integration based on explicit method for time evolution , introduces a severe constraint .",
    "in fact , as for the conventional grid based methods , spem has to satisfy the courant - friedrich - levy stability condition @xcite .",
    "as well known , this condition becomes highly restrictive when the geometry resolution forces the use of much finer space discretization than that is needed to solve for waves away from material irregularities or interfaces .",
    "this problem is firstly investigated in the paper in spem framework , in order to determine the largest allowed time increment . moreover , in technical literature , a great interest is addressed in finding numerical schemes which allow computational advantages together with unconditional stability @xcite .",
    "otherwise , an alternate implicit direction method is proposed for the time evolution of the electromagnetic field in the spem framework by preserving the leapfrog marching on in time of the explicit integration scheme . by considering a 2-stage splitting approach ,",
    "the leapfrog implicit formulation is carried out by suitably handling the formulas related to two adjacent time steps . by working with an implicit scheme ,",
    "a sparse linear system is generated and it has to be solved at each time step .",
    "the system matrix involves the kernel derivatives , and it can be assembled only once at the beginning of time integration process .",
    "details on the matrices used in the problem are investigated .",
    "the resulting algorithm is called as laf - spem method .",
    "accuracy degradation , due to a lack of particle consistency , is also taken into account : a numerical corrective strategy , which allows to restore the consistency , without any modification of the smoothing kernel function and its derivatives , is employed @xcite .",
    "test problems are simulated to validate the proposed methodology .",
    "simulations running with a time step larger than that satisfying the cfl condition has been found to remain stable , so improving the conventional spem algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "basic ideas on smoothed particle hydrodynamics method are recalled in order to provide the original spem numerical scheme in solving time - domain maxwell s curl equations .",
    "investigations about the stability criterion are also included . in section 3",
    "the laf - spem method is described and simulation results are reported and discussed in section 4 also by comparing with standard fdtd computations and existing exact solution .",
    "a brief conclusion complete the paper .",
    "the sph scheme has been adopted by the authors to compute the time - domain maxwell s curl equations by using particle approximation , so obtaining spem method @xcite . for the reader convenience ,",
    "a brief summary of spem fundamentals is reported in the following .",
    "let consider the standard maxwell  s curl equations in time domain , in a linear medium in the compact curl notation : @xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electric and magnetic vectors fields , @xmath4 is the conduction current density vector , @xmath5 as the time , @xmath6 the derivative operator , @xmath7 the medium permittivity , permeability , and conductivity , respectively , which are supposed to be constant .",
    "the sph method is based on an integral representation of the unknown function @xmath8 : @xmath9 + where @xmath10 is the problem domain and @xmath11 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the delta function is approximated by a smoothing kernel function @xmath12 depending on the spatial coordinates and on the smoothing length parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the smoothing kernel function must verify the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 2 .",
    "@xmath15 on a sub - domain of @xmath16 and @xmath17 outside ; 3 .",
    "@xmath18 4 .",
    "@xmath19 function value for a particle is monotonically decreasing + with increasing distance away from the particle .",
    "the discrete spatial formulation of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) has been obtained by using sph particle approximation : the integral representation is approximated over a set of particles placed in the problem domain .",
    "the particles are the points in which the fields components are computed at each time step , by using the information belonging to the neighbouring ones .",
    "the smoothing length _",
    "h _ defines the size of the support domain of each particle @xcite .",
    "particular attention has to be paid on the choice of _",
    "a too small _ h _ can lead to an inaccurate solution because not enough particles may be placed inside the influence area of a fixed particle @xmath20 ; a too large smoothing length , can smooth out local properties and the particle approximation suffers too . from now on , for each referred fixed particle @xmath20 , an own smoothing space length @xmath21 will be considered .",
    "the sph particle approximation of ( [ eq2 ] ) can be expressed as a linear combination of translates of a kernel basis function :    @xmath22    where _ np _ is the total number of particles in the influence domain of the fixed one @xmath20 and @xmath23 measures the surrounding media at the position of particle @xmath24 . _",
    "np _ is strictly related to the choice of the smoothing length @xmath21 . in computing the two interlaved maxwell s curl equations , particles for the electric field ( @xmath25-nodes ) and magnetic field ( @xmath26-nodes )",
    "must be considered in the spatial domain . due to the electric and magnetic coupling nature of maxwell s equations , spatial staggering of _ e_-nodes and _ h_-nodes",
    "is required .",
    "e_-nodes and the _ h_-nodes are arranged so that each _ e_-node is surrounded by _",
    "h_-nodes and each _",
    "h_-node is surrounded by _",
    "the electric field update depends on the magnetic particles in the neighbourhood of the fixed electric particle and viceversa . in solving ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "fields spatial derivatives have to be approximated by means of sph .",
    "the differential operators on the fields components are transmitted to the smoothing kernel function : so the kernel approximation allows differential operations to be determined from the values of the function and the derivatives of the kernel , rather than the derivatives of the function itself .",
    "however , this is really true only when the influence domain of a fixed particle is placed entirely inside the problem domain ; when the influence domain overlaps with the geometry boundary the smoothing kernel _",
    "w _ is truncated , and a resulting non - zero surface integral has to be opportunely treated in order to avoid the corruption of the numerical solution @xcite . in the following , for the sake of simplicity , and in agreement with the numerical results reported in section 4 ,",
    "a lossless medium is considered .",
    "thus , the two interleaved maxwell s curl equations ( [ eq2 ] ) result in spem formulation as follows : @xmath28 \\delta v_{j } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath29 \\delta v_{j}\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 \\delta v_{j}\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath31 \\delta v_{j}\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath32 \\delta v_{j}\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath33 \\delta v_{j}\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the positions of the _ i_-th and _ j_-th particle for the electric and magnetic field component , respectively ; @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the number of neighbouring particles of the _ i_-th fixed electric ( magnetic ) particle .",
    "the first derivative operator is indicated as @xmath38 , _ x , y , z _ as the spatial coordinates .",
    "a central finite difference algorithm is used to approximate time derivatives in ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a leapfrog scheme requiring only explicit updates , has been used for advancing the solution in time : the electric field is computed at whole time step and the magnetic field at the half time step @xcite . by indicating with @xmath41 the time step and with @xmath42 the generic step",

    "the previous constraint depends on the smoothing length value ; moreover , this last is strictly related to the spatial particles distances .",
    "therefore it requires the time step to be proportional to the smallest spatial point resolution : @xmath52    the previous condition guarantees the numerical stability , but it can makes the spem impractical to use , especially when the distance between the two closest nodes becomes very small . in this section",
    ", some efforts are made to obtain a better maximum allowable time step .",
    "namely , referring to the first case study reported in section 4 , a propagation of a 2d @xmath53 wave is considered . in this case , the discrete formulation of relations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) are compactly re - written , as follows : @xmath54\\\\ \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath55    @xmath56     + where @xmath57 are the vectors of the field components and @xmath58 as the matrices collecting the spatial field derivatives computed with spem formulation and the physical parameters of the problem domain . by substituting ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) in ( [ eq8 ] ) , i.e. : @xmath59\\textbf{e}_{z}^{n}+\\delta t",

    "the ( [ eq12 ] ) gives an upper limit to the increment of the time step getting away from the minimum particles spacing .",
    "furthermore , the restriction on @xmath41 limits the physical applications yet , so that in the following an unconditionally stable time advance equations has been introduced .",
    "the original spem method has been modified by preserving the leapfrog evolution in time of the explicit time integration scheme .",
    "in this section the leapfrog adi - fdtd method @xcite is generally described and re - formulated for generating the implicit leapfrog formulation of spem . in the adi - fdtd method , the temporal stepping from _",
    "n _ step is obtained by splitting the integer time step into two half - time steps . by indicating with _ e _ and _ h _ the fields components with respect to a generic coordinate in the _ x , y , z _ geometric system , the finite difference time domain scheme involves the following general relations , in which the actual field value is formally expressed as a generic function of the fields at previous time steps :    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71     + for the marching - on in time of the electric field components , equation ( [ eq16 ] ) is substituted in ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) is substituted in ( [ eq15 ] ) , so obtaining : @xmath72    @xmath73    in ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) first and second order spatial field derivatives hold and tridiagonal linear systems have to be solved to generate @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "<S> numerical solution of equations governing time domain simulations in computational electromagnetics , is usually based on grid methods in space and on explicit schemes for the time evolution . </S>",
    "<S> a predefined grid in the problem domain and a stability step size restriction must be accepted . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is given that efforts need for overcoming these heavy constraints . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the authors developed a meshless method to avoid the connective laws among the points scattered in the problem domain . despite the good spatial properties , the numerical explicit integration used in the original formulation of the method provides , also in a meshless context , spatial and time discretization strictly interleaved and mutually conditioned . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , in this paper the stability condition is firstly addressed in a general way by allowing the time step increment get away from the minimum points spacing . meanwhile , a formulation of the alternating direction implicit scheme for the evolution in time is combined with the meshless solver . </S>",
    "<S> the formulation preserves the leapfrog marching on in time of the explicit integration scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the new method , not constrained by a gridding in space and unconditionally stable in time , is numerical assessed by different numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> perfect matching layer technique is used in simulating open spatial problems ; otherwise , a consistency restoring approach is introduced in treating truncation at finite boundary and irregular points distribution . </S>",
    "<S> three case studies are investigated by achieving a satisfactory agreement comparing both numerical and analytical results .    </S>",
