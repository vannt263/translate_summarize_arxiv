    "the time points when the entropy density reaches its maximum are in between those of maximum density and maximum temperature .",
    "it indicates that when the system reaches the maximum compression stage in the central region , internal energy increases with the @xmath86 collision leading to the increasing numbers of states and therefor the entropy density is still rising up at that time . in contrast , isospin asymmetry is much later for reaching its minimum in comparison with other observables since it is mostly due to isospin transport process not directly relates to compression - expansion process .    as shown in fig .",

    "<S> thermalization process of nuclear matter in central fireball region of heavy - ion collisions is investigated by employing an extension model of boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck , namely the van der waals boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( vdwbuu ) model . </S>",
    "<S> temperature ( @xmath0 ) is extracted by the quantum fermion fluctuation approach and other thermodynamic quantities , such as density ( @xmath1 ) , entropy density ( @xmath2 ) , shear viscosity ( @xmath3 ) , isospin diffusivity ( @xmath4 ) and heat conductivity ( @xmath5 ) , are also deduced . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid - like and gas - like phase signs are discussed through the behavior of shear viscosity during heavy - ion collisions process with the vdwbuu model . </S>"
