    "when and how did disk galaxies form ?   at @xmath15 , disk galaxies that can be classified with the hubble s tuning fork",
    "exist ; they are identified with their apparent morphology , and/or their surface brightness distribution , and/or empirical indices describing such as central condensation and asymmetry . meanwhile , in the universe at @xmath16 , galaxies with various morphology are seen , and many of them show the presence of clumps and/or irregularity , though the morphology is traced in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the emergence of morphology classified with the hubble s tuning fork is considered to be around at @xmath17 , and formation of disk structure would also be expected at the epoch .",
    "the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath18 ) enables us to study morphology of galaxies in the rest - frame optical light well up to at @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite studied morphology evolution based on eye inspection .",
    "they found the disk population is increasing with redshift gradually and the population is very rare at @xmath20 . by using apparent morphology , similar trend",
    "is reported by @xcite for galaxies with a stellar mass range of @xmath21 and by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also studied the morphology evolution with eye inspection and a clearer emergence of the disk population at @xmath1 is seen after correcting for the statistical morphology misclassification .",
    "however , from the optical surface brightness distribution , the fraction of the disk galaxies is higher at @xmath20 @xcite . if the srsic index ( @xmath22 ) less than 2.5 is regarded to be an indicator of disk galaxies , the fraction of the disk population is larger at @xmath20 and is decreasing with redshift , though the details of the evolutional trend is not so simple",
    "; e.g. , if irregular galaxies are included in the sample , the disk fraction is more constant against redshift @xcite , or the fraction is rather constant for less massive galaxies ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite tried to model the two - dimensional surface brightness distribution with two components of srsic index of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and found a fraction of the disk ( @xmath24 component ) dominated galaxies decreases at @xmath1 rather sharply for stellar mass larger than @xmath26 .",
    "thus the opposite views are obtained in terms of the disk evolution .",
    "other parameters characterizing the morphological features such as central condensation , asymmetry , gini , m20 , etc seem not to be suitable to trace the morphology of galaxies in distant universe @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", studies of internal kinematics in star - forming galaxies such as bm / bx and star - forming bzk ( sbzk ) galaxies at @xmath1 revealed about one third of them show a clear rotation kinematics @xcite .",
    "this suggests we witness disk galaxies and they may be progenitor of present - day disk galaxies , though a fraction of them may evolve into the present - day elliptical galaxies through major merges , particularly those with large stellar mass .",
    "another piece of the suggestion for the disk progenitor scenario stems from the clustering property of sbzk galaxies ; sbzk galaxies with @xmath27 mag are considered to be a progenitor of present - day disk galaxies with regard to their weak clustering strength @xcite",
    ". it would be reasonable to suppose most of the sbzk galaxies in this magnitude range will evolve into the present - day disk galaxies , though the brighter sbzk galaxies may be a progenitor of elliptical galaxies .    motivated by the finding of the presence of many rotating disk among sbzk galaxies and clustering nature of them , we took a simple and straightforward approach to see whether the intrinsic shape of faint sbzk galaxies at @xmath1 is disk - like or not statistically based on apparent axial ratio distribution .",
    "we studied the surface brightness distribution and the apparent axial ratio in both rest - frame uv and optical light for sbzk galaxies with @xmath28 mag @xcite . @xcite and @xcite revealed the surface brightness distribution of them",
    "is characterized by srsic index of @xmath29 , and the half - light radius and surface stellar mass density is similar to those in the present - day disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it was turned out that the intrinsic shape of the sbzk galaxies is not a round disk ( round means intrinsic axial ratio of @xmath30 ) ; their intrinsic shape is bar - like or oval ( intrinsic axial ratio @xmath31 with the thickness similar to that of the present - day disk galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic bar - like structure of star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 is also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that this bar - like structure does not imply a direct progenitor of the local barred galaxies as discuss later .",
    "then , when did round disk galaxies appear after @xmath1 ?",
    "emergence of the round disk population should reflect the evolution process of the disk structure .",
    "hence , revealing evolution of the intrinsic shape of the galaxies is expected to give us an insight to physical process of the galaxy evolution . in this paper , we study the intrinsic shape of main sequence galaxies with @xmath32 mag in the redshift range from 2.5 to 0.5 using the same method as yuma et al .",

    "numerical simulations show a central mass condensation ( either of a bulge and/or a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) ) with a mass fraction of 1 - 10% of a disk dissolves the bar - like structure @xcite .",
    "thus the emergence of round disk population may be related to the growth of a central bulge and/or a smbh . according to the simulations by @xcite ,",
    "the bar - like structure gradually evolves into a round disk with a time scale of a few gyr , which is comparable to the elapsed time from @xmath177 to 0.9 ( @xmath64 gyr ) .",
    "however , eye inspection of our sample galaxies at @xmath161 suggests that bulge dominated galaxies are not the majority .",
    "the two - component model fit to discriminate bulge and disk in a galaxy is not straightforward and it is beyond our scope in this study .",
    "agn number density peaks at @xmath178 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the rapid growth of smbhs during the epoch .",
    "the growth of a smbh may also play a role for dissolving the bar structure , although the mass fraction may not be large enough .",
    "alternatively , the gradual cease of galaxy interaction may make a round disk .",
    "if this is the case , the epoch of the round disk population at @xmath14 would indicate the major galaxy interaction mostly ceased around at this redshift and the galaxy morphology is rather stable after this .",
    "further studies of link between intrinsic shape of disk and the growth of a bulge / smbh as well as galaxy interaction are desirable to disclose the evolution of disk galaxies .",
