    "granular gases , i.e. gases composed of particles of mesoscopic or macroscopic size which suffer inelastic collisions , may be described under certain assumptions by the same quantities as common molecular gases .",
    "one can define for these systems temperature , density , velocity field , etc .",
    ", and describe them within the framework of hydrodynamics . due to the inelasticity of the particles , however , there emerge new additional time and length scales .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", granular gases behave very differently from molecular gases .",
    "one observes cluster formation , e.g. ,  @xcite and vertexes , e.g. ,  @xcite during the evolution of an initially uniform granular gas .",
    "although plausible explanations of these effects exist ,  @xcite they still lack a comprehensive theory .    starting from a homogeneous state , all structures in granular gases",
    "develop after some time - lag . before noticeable inhomogeneities",
    "appear the gas evolves in the homogeneously cooling state ( hcs ) , when it gradually loses its energy according to inelastic collisions . during this regime of the evolution",
    "the gas is completely described by the current temperature ( which decreases with time ) and by the velocity distribution function .",
    "the hcs which precedes all further states of evolution , as e.g. clustering , is the most simple state of a granular gas .",
    "understanding the physics of the hcs might , therefore , shed some light on more complex phenomena such as cluster and vortex formation .    in the present study we focus",
    "on the diffusion processes in granular gases being in the hcs .",
    "we consider the case of a constant restitution coefficient , which frequently is assumed in literature but turns out to be an oversimplified model of a real collision , and impact - velocity dependent restitution coefficient as it is valid for viscoelastic particle interaction .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of granular particles is governed by the ( normal ) restitution coefficient @xmath0 which relates the normal components of the particle velocities before and after a collision , @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath3 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath4 gives the direction of the inter - center vector @xmath5 at the instant of the collision . from the conservation of momentum one",
    "finds the change of velocity for the colliding particles : @xmath6 for elastic collisions one has @xmath7 and for inelastic collisions @xmath8 decreases with increasing degree of inelasticity .    in literature",
    "it is frequently assumed that the restitution coefficient is a material constant , @xmath9 experiments , e.g.  @xcite , as well as theoretical investigations  @xcite show , however , that this assumption is not consistent with the nature of the inelastic collisions , it does not agree even with a dimension analysis  @xcite .",
    "the impact velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient @xmath10 has been obtained by generalizing hertz s contact problem to viscoelastic spheres  @xcite . from the generalized hertz equation one",
    "obtains the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient  @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the young modulus , @xmath14 is the poisson ratio , and @xmath15 depends on dissipative parameters of the particle material ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the effective mass and radius are defined as @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the radii and masses of the colliding particles .",
    "the constants are given by @xcite @xmath19 equation ( [ epsilon ] ) refers to the case of pure viscoelastic interaction , i.e. when the relative velocity @xmath20 is not too large ( to avoid plastic deformation of the particles ) and is not too small ( to allow to neglect surface effects such as roughness , adhesion and van der waals interactions ) .",
    "the diffusion equation @xmath21 describes the current @xmath22 of particles of sort @xmath15 at position @xmath23 against the density gradient @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the diffusion coefficient . using the continuity equation @xmath26",
    "we obtain the `` canonical '' diffusion equation : @xmath27 usually the term diffusion refers to the motion of a species of particles @xmath15 in a `` solution '' of other particles @xmath28 .",
    "it is also possible , however , that @xmath15 and @xmath28 are of the same type , distinguishable only by a feature which does not affect the mechanical properties , i.e. mechanically @xmath15 and @xmath28 are indistinguishable ; one may think of @xmath15 and @xmath28 having different colors .",
    "the process of diffusion of tagged particles among mechanically identical ones is called self - diffusion .",
    "the diffusion ( and self - diffusion ) coefficient is closely related with the mean square displacement of tagged particles with time .",
    "assume the tagged particles are located at time @xmath29 in the origin @xmath30 .",
    "then one can write for the square average displacement of particles at time @xmath31 : @xmath32 ^ 2   \\right\\rangle= \\left.\\int d \\vec{r } \\left [ \\vec{r(t)}\\right]^2 n_a ( \\vec{r},t ) \\right/\\int d \\vec{r } n_a ( \\vec{r})\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the fraction of particles @xmath15 located at @xmath23 at time @xmath31 .",
    "( note that @xmath34 is the total number of tagged particles . )",
    "now we multiply both sides of eq .",
    "( [ difcanon ] ) with @xmath35 and integrate over @xmath36 . using two times integration by parts and definition ( [ sqavdef ] ) ,",
    "one obtains for 3d - systems @xmath37 ^ 2   \\right\\rangle = 6d_a\\ , ;   \\qquad \\qquad \\left\\langle \\left [ \\vec{r } ( t ) \\right]^2   \\right\\rangle = 6d_at\\,.\\ ] ] using the kinematic relation @xmath38 , one obtains @xmath39 ^ 2   \\right\\rangle   = \\left < \\int_0^{t}\\vec{v}(t^{\\prime})dt^{\\prime}\\int_0^t   \\vec{v}(t^{\\prime \\prime } ) dt^{\\prime \\prime }   \\right >   \\label{delr}\\ ] ] and encounters with the velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) @xmath40 . for gases in equilibrium",
    "the vaf depends only on the time difference , @xmath41 and decays with a characteristic time @xmath42 . using these properties of the vaf",
    ", one can perform time - integration in ( [ delr ] ) for @xmath43 , i.e. for @xmath44 .",
    "taking into account ( [ sqavdef1 ] ) one obtains the basic relation @xmath45    although not stated explicitly , all the above discussion refers to the case of equilibrium gases .",
    "granular gases are _ a priori _ non - equilibrium systems , nevertheless , the concept of the diffusion coefficient may be generalized for such systems .",
    "obviously , this refers only to `` liquid '' or gaseous phases of the material  @xcite where the particles are highly mobile .",
    "as discussed in the introduction throughout this article we assume that the granular material is homogeneous and isotropic ( hcs ) .",
    "another quantity which we will need below is the `` granular temperature '' @xmath46 , which decreases with time due to the loss of kinetic energy according to inelastic collisions . if the particles do not lose too much energy in a collision , the temperature changes on a time - scale @xmath47 , which is much larger than the mean collision time @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this condition allows for the definition of temperature , but imposes some restrictions for the intervals of time and values of material parameters . for a full discussion",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "whereas the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 for equilibrium systems is just a constant , the time dependence of temperature causes the diffusion coefficient to be time dependent too .",
    "therefore , the natural generalization of the diffusion coefficient for nonequilibrium systems is the diffusivity @xmath51 the brackets @xmath52 denote averaging over the non - equilibrium ensemble , which evolution is described by a time - dependent @xmath53-particle distribution function @xmath54 ( for simplicity we left the same notation as for the equilibrium average ) .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the granular gas we use the formalism of the pseudo - liouville operator @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this formalism allows to treat the dynamics of a system of particles with hard - core ( i.e. singular ) interactions formally in the same way as if the particles would interact via a smooth potential . in classical mechanics",
    "the time derivative of any dynamical variable @xmath28 reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the poisson brackets , which imply differentiation of the hamiltonian with respect to the coordinates . for singular inter - particle potentials , like a hard - core potential ,",
    "poisson brackets are not well defined .",
    "nevertheless a liouville - like operator may be defined : @xmath58 the first sum in ( [ l ] ) refers to the free streaming of the particles ( the ideal part ) , while the second sum refers to the interactions of pairs of colliding particles @xmath59 which are described by the binary collision operator  @xcite : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the diameter of particles and @xmath62 is the normal component of the relative velocity of the colliding pair ( which , multiplied by the infinitesimal time @xmath63 , gives the length of the collision cylinder ) .",
    "the heaviside function @xmath64 selects approaching particles and the @xmath65-function represents the hard - core interaction .",
    "the operator @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some function of dynamical variables .",
    "the after - collision velocities of the colliding particles , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are related to their pre - collision values @xmath71 , @xmath72 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : restdef ] ) .",
    "the pseudo - liouville operator allows to perform calculations in a very elegant way : formal integration of eq .",
    "( [ ldef ] ) yields for ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 with ( [ evola ] ) the time - correlation function reads @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes integration over all degrees of freedom and @xmath77 depends on temperature @xmath78 , particle number density @xmath79 , etc . , which change on a time - scale @xmath80 . in accordance with the molecular chaos assumption at @xmath81",
    "the sequence of successive collisions occurs without correlations . if @xmath28 does not depend on the positions of the particles , its time - correlation function reads  @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes averaging with the distribution function taken at time @xmath84 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath85 is inverse to the initial slope of the vaf  @xcite .",
    "it may be found from the time derivative of @xmath86 taken at @xmath87 .",
    "( [ evolaa ] ) and ( [ aaexp ] ) then yield @xmath88 the relaxation time @xmath89 which depends on time via the distribution function @xmath77 , changes on the time - scale @xmath80 .",
    "following the idea described in section [ bp : ggd ] we calculate the velocity autocorrelation function and the self - diffusion coefficient . in the previous section we discussed a method to calculate the evolution of a general dynamic function @xmath90 .",

    "the calculation of @xmath98 may be performed if we assume that the distribution function @xmath77 is a product of the coordinate part , which corresponds to a uniform and isotropic system , and the velocity part being a product of maxwellian distribution functions @xmath99}{[2\\pi t(t^{\\prime})]^{3/2}}\\ , , \\quad i=1 , \\ldots , n\\ , .\\ ] ] we want to mention that a more sophisticated analysis ( e.g. @xcite ) shows that the velocity distribution function deviates from the maxwellian . in this paper",
    "we neglect these deviations which are small for small inelasticity of the particles ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "calculation of the diffusion coefficient with non - maxwellian velocity distribution function has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the result ( depending on the inelasticity ) may differ quantitatively from that given here , but its functional form remains unaffected .",
    "integration over the coordinate part in ( [ vtv ] ) yields @xmath101 where we use the definition of the two - particle distribution function and where @xmath102 is its contact value  @xcite , which depends on the packing fraction @xmath103 . with @xmath104 due to the collision rules and definition ( [ tij ] ) one finally arrives at @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the maxwellian distribution for the relative velocity of two particles . for @xmath0 not depending on @xmath107 eq .",
    "( [ vtv2 ] ) yields @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the enskog relaxation time  @xcite . for the granular gas it depends on time",
    "according to the same time - scale as temperature . according to eq .",
    "( [ tet ] ) the velocity correlation time for inelastic collisions is larger than for elastic collisions .",
    "this follows from partial suppression of backscattering of particles due to inelastic losses in their normal relative motion . as a result for inelastic particle interaction the angle between crossing trajectories after",
    "a collision is smaller than before the collision , while for elastic interaction both angles are identical .",
    "therefore , the velocity correlation time is larger for inelastically colliding particles .    using the velocity correlation function",
    "one writes @xmath110 on the short - time scale @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 may be considered as constants . integrating in ( [ difvel ] ) over @xmath114 and equating with ( [ dgengen ] ) yields for @xmath115 the diffusivity ( time - dependent self - diffusion coefficient ) @xmath116    using the pseudo - liouville operator one can also describe the time - dependence of the granular temperature : from ( [ ldef ] ) it follows ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath117 calculations similar to that for @xmath118 yield @xmath119\\ , t^{3/2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] so that finally one obtains a well known result for temperature @xmath120^{-2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 @xcite , @xmath122 is the initial temperature at @xmath29 , and @xmath123 is the initial mean collision time .",

    "nevertheless it was used in many publications for simplicity of the calculation . in this section",
    "we will calculate the diffusivity for a gas of viscoelastic particles for which @xmath0 is given by eq .",

    "( [ tet ] ) and we use eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) , which relates the coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "performing calculations similar to those for the constant restitution coefficient , one obtains for the time evolution of temperature @xmath134   \\label{tdot1}\\ ] ] where we introduce the small ( dissipative ) parameter @xmath135 the characteristic time for the temperature evolution @xmath136 and the numerical constant @xmath137 . solving eq .",
    "( [ tdot1 ] ) and expanding the result in terms of the small parameter @xmath65 yields @xmath138 with @xmath139 and @xmath140 being pure numbers  @xcite .    from eqs .",

    "( [ denskog ] ) and @xmath142 , @xmath143 are pure numbers  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the mean - square displacement reads for @xmath144 : @xmath145 this dependence holds true for @xmath146 where the first inequality follows from the condition @xmath144 , while the second one follows from the condition @xmath147 which makes the concept of the temperature meaningful .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ drasym ] ) and ( [ drcons ] ) one notes that the impact - velocity dependent restitution coefficient ( [ epsilon ] ) leads to a significant change of the long - time behavior of the mean - square displacement of particles in time .",
    "compared to its logarithmically weak dependence for @xmath9 ( simplified collision model ) , the impact - velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient ( [ epsilon ] ) as it appears for viscoelastic particles gives rise to a considerably faster spreading of particles according to a power law .",
    "we studied the diffusion of particles in a homogeneously cooling granular gas . with the assumption of molecular chaos we calculated the velocity time - correlation function and the time dependent self - diffusion coefficient ( diffusivity ) @xmath148 . for the case of constant coefficient of restitution @xmath9",
    "the diffusivity @xmath148 is expressed in terms of the model parameter @xmath0 . for the more realistic case of an impact velocity dependent restitution coefficient , as it has been derived for viscoelastic particle interaction",
    ", we found a relation which expresses the diffusivity in terms of material constants of the particles and characteristics of the granular gas , such as temperature , density , etc .    for granular particles suffering viscoelastic collisions we found that the mean - square displacement grows with time as a power law @xmath149 , i.e. much faster than the logarithmic growth @xmath150 for the case of a constant restitution coefficient .",
    "it worth to note that qualitatively this power - law dependence ( as well as the logarithmic one ) simply follows from scaling arguments and the time - dependence of temperature .",
    "indeed , the average velocity scales as @xmath151 , and therefore as @xmath152 for the constant restitution coefficient and as @xmath153 for the impact - velocity dependent coefficient .",
    "the diffusivity in granular gas scales as @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the mean - free path , which does not change with time ( in the regime preceding clustering ) , and @xmath156 is the mean - collision time .",
    "thus , @xmath157 , and we obtain that the mean - square displacement , @xmath158 , scales as @xmath159 in the former case and as @xmath160 in the latter .    what will be the impact of this apparently dramatic difference in the time dependence of @xmath161 for the properties of granular gases ? obviously , viscoelastic particles spread ( and , therefore , mix ) quicker than particles which interact via @xmath9 since the temperature decreases more slowly for the former case , as @xmath162 , as compared with @xmath163 for the latter one , retarded clustering may be expected .",
    "let us explain this in more detail : according to the linear stability analysis  @xcite , long - range density fluctuations in homogeneous granular gas occur to be unstable , i.e. they grow exponentially with time , leading to cluster formation .",
    "the critical value of the stable wavelengths @xmath164 ( @xmath165 is the wave number ) reads @xmath166  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "all density fluctuations with @xmath167 are unstable . for the case of viscoelastic particles",
    "the effective value of @xmath0 permanently grows with time ( as temperature decreases ) , and @xmath168 grows accordingly .",
    "this implies that the size of the regions , where the gas is still homogeneous , grows with time , since density fluctuations do not blow up on length scales smaller than @xmath168 .",
    "thus for the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient the critical wavelength increases with time ( i.e. one has a time - dependent criterion for the size of the region which is unstable in the hcs ) . as compared to the case @xmath169 , clustering occurs on a larger length - scale ; hence the conditions to remain in the homogeneous medium persist for a longer time for viscoelastic particles .",
    "obviously , self - diffusion directly counteracts clustering .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that for a granular gas of viscoelastic particles which implies an impact velocity dependent restitution coefficient , clustering is retarded as compared with a gas under the oversimplified assumption @xmath9            p. deltour and j. l. barrat , j. phys . i ( paris ) * 7 * , 137 ( 1997 ) ; f. spahn , u. schwarz , and j. kurths , phys . rev . lett .",
