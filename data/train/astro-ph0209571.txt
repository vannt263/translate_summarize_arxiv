    "( 2000 ) found that 97 percent of the optical proto - planetary discs in the trapezium cluster exhibit excess in the _ jhkl _ colour - colour diagram , indicating that the most likely origin of the observed ir excesses are the circumstellar discs .",
    "the _ disc lifetime _ derived by examining the fraction of ir excess stars ( the _ disc fraction _ ) of young stellar populations as a function of age provides an empirical limit on the duration of the disc accretion phase .",
    "this is critical for understanding the evolutionary paths followed by pms stars in the hr diagram , their angular momentum histories , and the timescales available for planet building ( e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ; hillenbrand et al .",
    "1998 ; telesco et al .",

    "considerable debate has waged concerning the longevity of discs around low mass pms stars .",
    "the effort is difficult because samples are often incomplete and biased : ctt stars are typically located by h@xmath4 and near - ir excess surveys , while wtt stars are mostly found through x - ray surveys ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) . an influential early study on the timescale for disc dissipation by strom et al . (",
    "1989 ) , based on several dozen pms stars in the taurus - auriga complex , reported the ctt / wtt transition occurs around an age @xmath8 myr .",
    "this result is supported by a recent _ jhkl _ survey of 7 clusters with mean ages from 0.5 to 5 myr that shows half the stars lose their discs within 3 myr and essentially all lose their discs in 6 myr ( haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) . at a later age of @xmath9 myr , only 1/110 sco - cen late - type stars show spectroscopic ctt emission lines and @xmath10-band excesses ( mamajek , meyer & liebert 2002 ) .    however , other studies suggest discs are more enduring .",
    "no evolution in disc fraction is found in the stellar populations of the orion nebula cluster from @xmath11 myr ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1998 ) , and in ngc 2264 from @xmath12 myr ( rebull et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the chamaeleon i cloud population , where the sample is enhanced through x - ray and _ iso _ surveys , shows no difference in the age distribution of ctt and wtt stars from @xmath13 myr ( lawson , feigelson & huenemoerder 1996 ) .",
    "spectroscopic study of the @xmath7 myr - old tw hydrae association members found active accretion in 2 stars ; tw hya and hen 3 - 600a ( muzerolle et al . 2000 ) , albeit at mass accretion rates @xmath14 magnitudes lower than is derived for younger accreting systems .",
    "the measurement of disc lifetimes is muddied by several other issues .",
    "first , despite the broad overlap in ctt and wtt age distributions , few intermediate cases are known suggesting that the transition between the two states is rapid ( wolk & walter 1996 ) .",
    "secondly , some studies suggest that two disc lifetimes must be considered ; one associated with a rapid decline in accretion onto the star and another associated with a slower dissipation of the outer disc ( clarke , gendrin & sotomayor 2001 ) .",
    "third , efforts to reconcile rotational distributions of both pms and zero - age main sequence stellar clusters assuming star - disc rotational coupling during the accretion phase have deduced relatively long @xmath15 myr disc lifetimes for slowly rotating stars ( bouvier , forestini & allain 1997 ; tinker , pinsonneault & terndrup 2002 ) , but @xmath16 myr disc lifetimes may suffice if the stellar interiors have sufficient radial differential rotation ( barnes , sofia & pinsonneault 2001 ) . finally , the astrophysical processes leading to disc dissipation are highly uncertain .",
    "possible mechanisms include accretion onto the star , bipolar outflow , stellar winds , photoevaporation , close gravitational encounters and incorporation of disc material into planets ( see the review by hollenbach , yorke & johnstone 2000 ) .",
    "the recently discovered @xmath1 chamaeleontis cluster has the potential of clarifying some of the observational issues .",
    "it is a nearby ( @xmath17 pc ) , compact ( extent @xmath181 pc ) and coeval ( @xmath19 myr ; lawson & feigelson 2001 ) system of pms stars with a small ( 15 known primaries ) population of stars spanning a relatively large range in mass ( @xmath20 m@xmath21 ; mamajek , lawson & feigelson 1999 , 2000 ; lawson et al .",

    "importantly , this census is known to be virtually complete in the inner region from a combination of a deep @xmath24 exposure , optical photometry and proper motion study of the field . unlike most other pms populations , these membership criteria are independent of the presence or absence of circumstellar discs .",
    "we can thus use the @xmath1 cha population as an unbiased laboratory to investigate the fraction of ir excess and accretion at a critical intermediate - age phase of disc evolution .",

    "as kenyon & gmez ( 2001 ) convincingly showed in their spirex @xmath25-band study of the cha i molecular cloud , @xmath25-band photometry is nearly essential for a meaningful evaluation of the disc fraction in a young stellar population .",

    "i , only those stars with the largest ir excesses fall to the right of the reddening band in the _ jhk _ plane , whereas many more stars fall to the right of the reddening band once @xmath25-band data is available .",

    "this criterion also largely eliminates uncertainty in the reddening law as a contributor to the disc fraction , as the reddening line is almost constant in ( @xmath47 ) colour over the narrow range of ( @xmath39 ) colours for the late - type stars .    from figure 1(b ) , the ` gap ' in the ( @xmath47 ) colours between 0.34 and 0.49 allows us to count 7 stars as the most likely number of ir excess objects in the low - mass population ) = 0.4 delineated the disced and the discless populations . ] . to estimate the uncertainty in this number",

    "we count the same 7 stars as the most - likely ir excess objects .",
    "if we adopt the same 2@xmath3 error budget as above , we again count @xmath48 as the range of ir excess stars . also , as the faint cluster member echa j0841.57853 has _ jhk _ colours consistent with its m4 spectral type ,",

    "thus with @xmath53 certainty , 2 of the 3 early - type cluster members are ir excess objects .      since an ir excess most likely indicates the presence of a circumstellar disc , we might then expect to find a correlation between the ir excess and accretion indicators such as enhanced h@xmath4 emission , which is believed to originate in magnetospheric columns allowing transport of disc material to the stellar surface .",

    "comparison of the ir colour excesses indicates the 3 k - type stars ( recx 1 , 7 and 11 ) have @xmath10-band excesses of @xmath82 mag , which has the effect of increasing the ( @xmath40 ) colours and decreasing the ( @xmath47 ) colours .",
    "this effect is not seen in the m - type stars , and can not be attributed to reddening . without 2-@xmath26 m spectroscopy we can not confirm if the excess is due to @xmath10-band activity , e.g. greene & lada ( 1996 ) detected br@xmath83 emission in half the ctt stars in a sample of @xmath84 oph pms stars , although in none of the wtt stars .",
    "for recx 1 , an increase in the ( @xmath47 ) colour of @xmath82 mag would make the ir excess significant .",
    "however , the star is already included in our estimate of ir excess objects once we account for observational uncertainties .",
    "considerable uncertainty reigns concerning the longevity , or more likely , the distribution of longevities , of circumstellar discs ( section 1 ) . despite its modest population ,",
    "the @xmath1 cha cluster provides a rare opportunity to examine  at high sensitivity  disc properties of pms stars with intermediate ages whose selection is unbiased with respect to disc existence cha cluster in this respect is recognized by its inclusion in the first year guaranteed time programme of the _ space infrared telescope facility_. ] . if discs decay rapidly as indicated by some past studies , then no discs at all are expected in this cluster .",
    "we find , however , that 9/15 or 60 percent of @xmath1 cha primaries show ir excesses in the @xmath85 diagram ( the late - type stars identified in figure 2 , plus @xmath1 cha and hd 75505 ) .",
    "the excess can not be attributed to errors in photometry ( section 2 ) , binarity ( section 3.4.1 ) or reddening ( section 3.4.2 ) .",
    "long - lived circumstellar discs are the only plausible explanation .",
    "one of these stars , echa j0843.3 - 7905 , is a ctt star with active accretion ( lawson et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the h@xmath86 correlation seen in the late - type population suggests that up to 3 other stars may be accreting ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic study now underway will address this issue .    why do we find a high disc fraction at @xmath87 myr when some other studies find discs largely disappear by @xmath88 myr ?",
    "we first recognize that , except for echa j0843.3 - 7905 , the @xmath1 cha discs would have been mostly missed from _",
    "colours alone ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "sensitive @xmath89band surveys are essential for the detection of aging pms discs .",
    "the principal discrepancy among @xmath89band studies lies between our high disc fraction ( 9/15 or 0.60 ) in @xmath1 cha and the low disc fraction ( 9/75 or 0.12 ) for the 5 myr old cluster ngc 2362 found by haisch et al .",
    "we suggest several explanations for this difference .",
    "first , the assigned age of ngc 2362 pms stars relies solely on the turnoff age of the o9ib supergiant @xmath90 cma ( balona & laney 1996 ) and the assumption that all stars in the cluster are coeval .",
    "secondly , ngc 2362 is 1480 pc distant compared to 97 pc for @xmath1 cha .",
    "the distance ratio alone degrades the @xmath25-band sensitivity by a factor of 200 . because of this",
    ", faint discs in ngc 2362 may not have been detected . also , the limiting mass of the haisch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) study of ngc 2362 is @xmath91 m@xmath21 ( spectral type mid - k ) compared to @xmath92 m@xmath21 ( spectral type m4 ) in our study of @xmath1 cha .",
    "as we discuss in section 3.1 , it is easier to detect an ir excess in a late - m star , compared to a k - type star , using standard ir colour - colour plane analysis . also , it is possible that disc lifetimes are shorter in higher mass stars .",
    "third , there might be variance in the disc destruction rate amongst clusters due to different rates of close encounters or photoevaporation due to massive stars , e.g. the discs in ngc 2362 might have been stripped by the uv / wind of @xmath90 cma ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "2000 for theory ) .",
    "a combination of the above factors can explain why there is a @xmath93 dispersion in the observed disc fraction for pms star clusters of a similar age ( hillenbrand & meyer 1999 ) . while noting these differences , our results seen together with studies of other older nearby pms stars ( e.g. study of the tw hydrae association members by muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ) indicate that ir - detected discs can be present in @xmath94 percent , and accretion discs can be present in @xmath95 percent , of @xmath7 myr - old pms stars .",
