    "pseudo - cubic manganites are remarkable for their rich phase diagram although properties of various phases have not been studied equally well .",
    "for example , the mechanisms of the `` charge ordering '' phenomenon ( co - phase ) or of the metallic anti - ferromagnetic phase ( a - phase ) , which usually appear near @xmath12 , to a large extent remain to be poorly understood .",
    "it is also surprising that the potential of metallic manganites as the basic elements for various hetero - structures in development of alternate devices is practically unexplored . meanwhile",
    "the diversity of their phases depending on temperature and doping concentration poses interesting questions regarding phenomena that may take place at the interface of the contacts between them .",
    "further understanding of magneto - transport properties of these materials also remains of prime importance because of several reasons .",
    "one of them is the colossal magneto - resistance effect , observed in these compounds at room temperatures . at the same time",
    "there is an increased general interest in the artificial engineering of nano - structure materials with novel physical properties , such as the giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) effect ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the discovery of the gmr effect has generated a lot of investigations focused on understanding the physical mechanism of this phenomena and that is why use of artificial hetero - structures composed of manganites suggests an interesting direction of research .",
    "indeed , the a - phase with its weakly coupled ferromagnetic planes is a natural spin - valve system itself  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results for large magneto - resistance on the domain walls in strained ferromagnetic manganite films provide another interesting example of such properties that may become important for various applications @xcite .",
    "last but not least is a richness of magnetic and transport properties of manganites . concentration dependence and even overall topology pattern of the phase diagram varies from material to material in these compounds with general formula a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( a = la , pr , nd ; b = sr , ca ) @xcite . in what follows we concentrate our attention mainly on la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lsmo ) compounds because there are no complications due to `` charge ordering '' . instead their phase diagram is remarkable for the metallic ferromagnetic and metallic anti - ferromagnetic phases inside the concentration ranges @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspondingly @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lsmo compounds allow the use of band description for broad concentration range .    usually among the main difficulties in trying to describe the properties of magnetic hetero - structures on the theory part lies the fact that a contact area between the two materials with different magnetic ordering corresponds to an abrupt change in the underlying ground states : microscopic effects at the boundaries , values of transmission coefficients of carriers , change in the exchange mechanisms between the core spins _ etc .",
    "_ , all of them taking place at the contact on the atomic scale .",
    "we are motivated by the idea that the boundary between two manganite phases with rather close doping levels may present a better ground for the understanding of interface phenomena .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that attempts to fabricate and investigate the characteristics of manganite hetero - structures have already been made @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a study of an electronic spectrum , mechanisms of conductivity and magneto - conductivity of both the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic ( a - phase ) phases .",
    "in particular , we address the phenomena that may appear at the interface of their contact .",
    "we use our results as an attempt to rationalize some experimental observations @xcite performed on films and hetero - structures made of manganites having these two phases as ground states .",
    "manganites are thought to belong to the group of the materials with strongly correlated electrons . as it was mentioned above",
    ", their phase diagram consists of numerous phases , with a crossover from one phase to another upon change in temperature @xmath15 , doping concentration @xmath16 or composition , a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 , ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the parent lamno@xmath2 compound has the anti - ferromagnetic insulating state ( a@xmath17 ) at low temperatures . upon sr substitution with la above @xmath18 , it undergoes a transition to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic state . with further increase in doping ( @xmath19 ) , as it was mentioned above , there is a transition from a ferromagnetic metallic to another anti - ferromagnetic metallic state ( a - phase ) .",
    "the latter is defined as the phase , in which the core ( @xmath20 ) spins are aligned ferromagnetically in the planes ( for example , @xmath21-plane ) and anti - ferromagnetically along the axis perpendicular to the planes ( @xmath22-axis ) . in the ferromagnetic phase electrons",
    "are fully polarized ( `` half - metallic '' state ) .",
    "the `` half - metallic '' state is also realized inside the @xmath21-planes of the a - phase .",
    "below we restrict our consideration to low temperatures .    despite of the mutual consent on the prevailing role of the double exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite as the basic mechanism responsible for ferromagnetism in manganites ,",
    "there are several theories describing their low - temperature properties from different perspectives ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "for our purposes it is worth mentioning right here that for the concentration range @xmath23 , the physical properties of the lsmo compounds at least at low temperatures can be accounted for within the double exchange ( de ) model generalized for the degenerate orbitals @xcite .",
    "the scheme suggested in @xcite is basically the band model utilizing however such important features of manganites as large values of hund s coupling constant , @xmath24 , and double degeneracy of the @xmath25 orbitals .",
    "it was shown to be capable of some predictions regarding the evolution of the physical characteristics with change in electron concentration upon doping . at larger concentrations the super - exchange interaction between the @xmath20",
    "core spins also plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the fact that the band picture captures the main physics of manganites is not obvious .",
    "often a generalized hubbard model is used to account for strong electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "however , instead of a direct hubbard on - site @xmath26 which hinders the double occupation on each mn site , one may consider the local jahn - teller effect as another way to describe the same physics . indeed , a single electron positioned on the degenerate @xmath27-orbital of the mn site will cause a local lattice distortion , reducing the energy of a system . on the other hand two electrons on the same site do not lead to jahn - teller instability and the jahn - teller energy gain does not realize itself . therefore in the local picture",
    "it is energetically favorable to have a single electron on a given site .",
    "we should also mention the large values of the hund s coupling ( @xmath28ev ) , which is responsible for the polarization of all electrons on the mn site .",
    "a tendency to the jahn - teller effect causes strong electron - phonon interaction which is thought to be the reason for various structural transitions in manganites , affecting their electronic properties .",
    "the jahn - teller instability is inherent to the _ local _ high - spin @xmath29 configuration of a manganese ion due to double degeneracy of the @xmath27 orbitals .",
    "when such an instability realizes itself as a _ cooperative _ jahn - teller transition , it also accounts for the coulomb interactions in a system , as it was discussed above .",
    "in addition the coherent long - range order correlations of the local distortions along the crystal lattice favor the band description for electrons .",
    "stability of the anti - ferromagnetic ( a-phase ) for the parent lamno@xmath2 compound was indeed explained in ref .",
    "[ ] in terms of the jahn - teller cooperative effect incorporated into the two - band tight - binding approximation .",
    "a primary manifestation of the jahn - teller effect comes about with an appearance of a proper deformation of the mno@xmath4 octahedron .",
    "however substitutional doping also leads to the lattice deformations .",
    "mismatch between the sizes of different ions is expressed by the value of the tolerance factor , @xmath3 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the ionic radii of each element in a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 . a process of doping results in an average change of the lattice parameters , which may be described by the average @xmath32 .",
    "when the value of @xmath32 is close to 1 , the `` cubic '' perovskite structure is realized as a whole .",
    "one must distinguish @xmath32 from its `` local '' value : two materials may have close @xmath32 , i.e. close lattice parameters , but the local distortions or disorder may differ strongly from one site to another .",
    "experiments show ( see @xcite and references there in ) that two compounds with close overall @xmath33 often have very different values of residual resistivity , @xmath34 .",
    "analysis in terms of the band electrons is applicable if local disorder remains reasonably small , i.e. the mean free path of electrons is large enough . from this point of view , the considerable differences in the values of conductivity of various ferromagnetic manganites at the same doping level should be ascribed to strong variations in the values of the local tolerance factor . with the increase in disorder the mean free path",
    "may become so short that the anderson mobility edge would hinder metallic conductivity even in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "such an unifying view turns out to be rather helpful for classification of the physical properties of the whole series of doped manganites @xcite .    before proceeding further another simple observation regarding the role of the jahn - teller instability",
    "can be made . at @xmath35 , according to @xcite , the a-phase in lamno@xmath2 is in the cooperative state with all bands filled up by electrons .",
    "the sr doping lifts the local degeneracy of the @xmath27 orbitals and introduces random strains in the lattice .",
    "de - localization in the electronic bands and hence gain in the kinetic energy also competes with _ cooperative _ jahn - teller effects .",
    "therefore , it is expected that at intermediate concentrations @xmath16 the a- phase is destroyed resulting in an appearance of the ferromagnetic phase in the framework of the de mechanism .",
    "there is no electron - hole symmetry in the two orbital model . at @xmath36",
    "there are no electrons in the system and , therefore , departing from the `` other end '' of the phase diagram , @xmath37 , small number of carriers , @xmath38 , experience the jahn - teller instability and should be trapped locally at the mn sites . with an increase in the number of electrons ,",
    "local jahn - teller traps will merge into a coherent state which is responsible for another lattice structure with the directions of spins remaining to be arranged .",
    "although the cooperative jahn - teller effect seems to be a major mechanism responsible for the diversity of the phase diagram of manganites at @xmath12 and higher , spin interactions must be included to finally specify the resulting ground states @xcite .    due to the small differences in ionic radii between the la and sr atoms ( @xmath33 ) , it seems , that the band description works best for la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 compounds @xcite . for these materials , being in the ferromagnetic metallic state",
    ", the residual resistivity can be as small as @xmath39  @xcite , which is a good metallic conductivity range .",
    "unfortunately , so far there are not so many experimental papers that deal with lsmo .",
    "nevertheless , there are few @xcite and in what follows we keep lsmo materials in mind in our approach to different phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we first study the magneto - transport properties of the manganites for a more general case of a _ canted _ a - phase @xcite .",
    "this term means that the core @xmath20 spins of the mn ions maintain both the fm and afm components ( e.g. spins in the a - phase can be canted by applying an external magnetic field ) .",
    "we first derive an expression for the energy spectrum of electrons for the canted a - phase manganites ( section ii ) and then proceed with the derivation of the formulas for the magneto - conductivity by generalizing the diagrammatic `` cross '' technique @xcite for green functions in the two - band model ( section iii ) .",
    "specific case of manganites makes a modification in the form of the `` impurity potentials '' necessary , to include a dependence on the orbital indexes .",
    "more specifically , the distortions of the mn - o - mn conduction network are primarily caused by random octahedral distortions . with sr doping ,",
    "the number of distorted octahedron increases so that one may expect a correlation between the number of carriers and the value of conductivity even for the high - quality samples .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the tight binding approximation in the frame of the two - orbital de model @xcite .",
    "this model , as we already mentioned , has proved to capture the main physical properties of manganites at least in the metallic concentration range . finally in section",
    "iv we briefly discuss phenomena in the vicinity of the interface between the a - phase and fm - phase manganites .",
    "the details of our numerical calculations with some exact results are provided in appendix .",
    "in the concluding section together with a general discussion an attempt also made to apply the results to recent experiments on la@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2/la@xmath6sr@xmath5mno@xmath2 superlattices @xcite .",
    "we start directly with a general case of the canted a - phase magnetic structure .",
    "the band hamiltonian has the form : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is an electron hopping matrix for the two - band model , @xmath24 is the hund s coupling constant on the mn sites , and @xmath42 is the fourier component of the af ordering along the _ c _ direction , @xmath43 .",

    "the orientations of @xmath46 and @xmath50 are fixed by magnetic anisotropy ( easy plane ) and/or by an external field .",

    "we obtain the following equation of motion : @xmath55 and similar equation for @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the secular equation , is now an @xmath57 determinant from which one must calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",
    "let us remind that the double exchange ( de ) mechanism for the manganites @xcite exploits the large value of the hund interaction , @xmath58 ev , so that @xmath59 . using this approximation , we solve eq .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) , it is straightforward to express operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in terms of the new eigenfunctions . quite generally , the transformation has the form : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are creation and annihilation operators for the true energy branches ( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath68 .",

    "the @xmath27 doublet gets split and the oxygen octahedron becomes distorted .",
    "since , in accordance with our introductory remarks , this effect is of prime importance for the mn - o - mn conduction network , disorder in manganites to a large extent comes about through a change in doping . in application of diagrammatic cross - technique , however , we assume that positions of `` impurities '' ( i.e. of b ions ) remain random and there is no correlations between the scattering processes from any two of them . secondly , for the `` impurity '' potential @xmath72 in @xmath73 ( where summation is held over the random realizations of the `` impurities '' ) one can assume the jahn - teller form of the defect potential . using the basis given by eq .",

    "parameters of the electronic spectrum are chosen beginning with the initial two - band `` cubic '' phase which , as we believe , realizes itself in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "let us also recall that the disorder in the calculations presented above expresses itself through the local octahedra distortion which , in turn , is produced by the substitutional disorder , i.e. by non - stoichiometric a@xmath0b@xmath1mno@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in ( [ eq20 ] ) the `` concentration '' of `` impurities '' is the concentration of b atoms , while the amplitude of the disorder potential is given by the value of @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) . change in composition by increasing @xmath16 decreases the number of carriers , @xmath38 , while increasing the number of defects _",
    "simultaneously_. another significant simplification above was that the distortions of the oxygen octahedra were treated independently .",
    "indeed this is a good approximation , because two octahedra surrounding two neighboring mn atoms share one oxygen atom only .",

    "factor @xmath94 in ( [ eq15 ] ) is not the only reason for dependence of conductivity on @xmath16 in ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "change in carrier concentration results in a shift of the chemical potential relative to the bottom of the bands which reflects itself in an immediate change in the occupation number in each of the four active energy bands ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "such a non - trivial intimate dependence between the number of carriers and the number of defects presents itself as a new feature for conductivity behavior in manganites .",
    "it would be of great interest to investigate such a trend experimentally .",
    "currently a shortage of experimental data for lsmo compounds for large enough sr concentrations deprives us the possibility to trace that dependence in some more details .",

    "difference in doping concentrations produces a difference in the chemical potentials on both sides away from the contact , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , i.e. difference in the `` work functions '' of two components .",
    "that leads to a redistribution of carriers near the contact plane .",
    "this effect is general and well known for the contacts between metals or semiconductors .",
    "a simplifying feature for the contacts of two manganites is in similarity of the underlying band structures on the both sides of a contact . at the same time",

    "stacks of manganite films of different thickness with abrupt change in sr concentration in the ( lasr ) planes in order to stabilize fm- or a - phase , can be made using the state of the art deposition techniques @xcite .",
    "however contacts between the fm state and the a - phase studied in @xcite pose more questions than the preceding example of the contact between the two unequally doped ferromagnetic metallic manganites .",

    "pr@xmath148sr@xmath148mno@xmath2 , nd@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 and la@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2  @xcite the values of the in - plane resistivity of these compounds lie in the range @xmath149 . in these samples one obviously has the conductivity regime in the a - phase lying close to the mobility edge .",
    "as we have seen , magnetoconductivity and other properties of the a - phase are interesting enough to justify the efforts to improve the values of resistivity in the a - phase manganites . as for the lsmo films and hetero - structures prepared in @xcite ,",
    "the value of residual resistivity in the ferromagnetic state of la@xmath6sr@xmath5mno@xmath2 compound and the value of the in - plane residual resistivity of the a - phase la@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 compound are @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "the films were prepared by a pulsed deposition method and obviously are not clean enough .",
    "nevertheless , qualitatively there is an agreement : our calculations of the values of resistivity for ferromagnetic phase and a - phase ( when @xmath116 ) for the sr concentrations @xmath152 and @xmath153 correspondingly gave a factor of ten difference while the experimentally observed difference is only a factor of two .",
    "as far as an interface is concerned , the complications that lie on the theory part are as follows .",
    "the de mechanism that played such an important role in exploring the properties of the half - metallic magnetic ground state , bears a non - local character .",
    "therefore it is not straightforward to account for it in an inhomogeneous problem with a spatial dependence near the interface ( recently , there were attempts to present the de mechanism in a local form to describe the various domain structures in fm metallic manganites @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , diminishing the number of band electrons , the anti - ferromagnetic super - exchange interaction between the @xmath20 spins becomes comparable with the de interaction .",
    "the task of combining these two mechanisms to study an inhomogeneous problem is already a serious problem .",
    "the a - phase ground state has been found in a number of other compounds , such as pr@xmath148sr@xmath148mno@xmath2 and nd@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the transition into the a - phase along the temperature axis is of the first order as it is expected from symmetry considerations .",
    "it is accompanied by a change in the @xmath154 ratio @xcite .",
    "such a transition is often described in the literature in terms of the `` orbital ordering '' @xcite .",
    "we suggest to interpret this transition as a cooperative jahn - teller effect involving the proper lattice distortion .",
    "indeed , so far we have discussed changes in the electronic band structure caused by spin re - arrangements only . meanwhile , as it was discussed in introduction , lattice effects may also play an important role .",
    "judging from various experimental results ( for a review , see @xcite ) , the importance of the lattice effects may vary and depend on a specific compound . for example , the lattice deformations strongly prevail in nd@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 compound @xcite .",
    "its ground state shows huge anisotropy in resistivity ( @xmath155 ) and much lower in - plane conductivity compared to other members of the a - phase family @xcite . as it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] the strong enough shear deformation @xmath156 of the oxygen octahedra ( @xmath11 ) alone may lead to a in practically two - dimensional electronic spectrum .",
    "we suppose that nd@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 is such an extreme case ( @xmath157 ) @xcite .",
    "after carriers are added to the 2d bands both their and core spins adjust themselves via de and super - exchange mechanisms . if in other a - phase compounds the tetragonal deformations of the lattice , @xmath11 , is less pronounced , one may neglect it as we have done above for la@xmath8sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 .",
    "the phase diagram for the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 as a function of sr doping @xmath16 and fixed tetragonal distortion @xmath154 has been theoretically studied in @xcite .",
    "we note , that the jahn - teller interaction has not been considered in @xcite and the electronic band structure was obtained for a fixed values of @xmath154 .    much attention in ref .",
    "[ ] was also given to the characterization of properties of the hetero - structures consisting of mixed phases [ f@xmath158 , a@xmath159 ( @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the number of unit cells per period of the structure ) .",
    "major conclusion drawn by the authors @xcite from data on magnetization , structural characterization of the modulated films and their in - plane conductivity have led them to the notion of stable fm and a - phase single layers , which preserve their integrity and stability even in very thin intervening structures such as @xmath162 .",
    "this result supports the point that stability of the a - phase layers is due to the coherent octahedra shrinkage , @xmath11 , in the planes .",
    "such an idea leaves room for speculation regarding the possible spin arrangements in the heterostructures .",
    "it is interesting that the conductivity measurements for the samples with composition [ f@xmath163 , a@xmath163 ] gave lower values of conductivity as if it were due to the fm layers alone .",
    "we ascribe this to the effect of charge re - distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ potel](b ) : ferromagnetic layers having more carriers supply part of them to the a - phase layers .",
    "ten layers of each phase is already a good approximation for the picture of a single interface , as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ spins ] . with",
    "@xmath160 and @xmath161 decreased , the role of coulomb effects becomes weaker and each layer preserves its nominal composition and , hence , the in - plane conductivity .",
    "one more comment we would like to add to the latter point concerns a pronounced increase in magneto - conductivity toward the [ f@xmath165 , a@xmath165 ] samples . if the number of electrons on each fm- and",
    "a - phase planes does not change , the positive magneto - conductivity effect is an indication of stronger canting of the moments in these samples .",
