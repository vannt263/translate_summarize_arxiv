    "high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) have been observed in some black hole ( bh ) x - ray binaries , which only appear in `` steep power law '' state in high luminosity ( @xmath1 ) and are in range of 40 to @xmath2 .",
    "these frequencies are comparable to the orbital frequency of innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of a stellar - mass bh .",
    "it is believed that the mechanism behind them is closely related to the dynamics of inner regions of bh accretion disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite studied the effect of viscosity on the disk stability and found the sonic - point instability ( its original name is pulsational instability ) , which is the excitation process of so called @xmath0-mode oscillations in transonic accretion flows ( this oscillation has the other name , inertial - acoustic oscillation , but we only call it @xmath0-mode oscillation in this paper ) .",
    "the mechanism of this instability is analogous to the @xmath3-mechanism in stellar pulsations .",
    "if the viscous parameter @xmath4 of @xmath4-prescription @xcite is larger than a critical value , the instability will arise from the phase relation between the viscous heat generation and oscillation , i.e. the viscous heat generation increase ( decrease ) in the compressed ( expanded ) phase of disk oscillation @xcite .    a series of works @xcite were dedicated to study the role of viscosity on hfqpos .",
    "they all found the oscillation , whose frequency is close to the maximum of epicyclic frequency @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , @xcite also found many overtones , whose frequencies are close to the integer multiples of @xmath5 .",
    "though the famous @xmath4-prescription has been used extensively since 1973 , it may be too simple to closely accord with actual accretion flows .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shearing box simulations of @xcite implied that there is certain time - delay between the viscous stress and total pressure instead of the instantaneity introduced by @xmath4-prescription .",
    "the other work of @xcite , which is based on a few relativistic mhd global simulations , pointed out that the parameter @xmath4 is a function of radius but not constant in the inner disk region .",
    "more than one decade ago , @xcite analyzed effects of viscous time - delay on the @xmath0-mode oscillations and they found that it has a little of inhibition on the growth of oscillations but excitation still exists for high viscosity cases .    our work presented in this letter is also dedicated to study the role of viscosity on qpos .",
    "the distinction of our model is the evolutionary viscous stress equation ( instead of the @xmath4-prescription ) , which is constructed to mimic effects of viscous time - delay and inconstant @xmath4 basing on the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in previous section , we adopt an additional evolutionary stress equation to describe the viscosity instead of the @xmath4-prescription .",
    "this equation can be written as @xmath23 where the factor @xmath24 is the practical viscous time - delay , which is scaled with the typical delay @xmath25 by parameter @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the expected stress by turbulence .",
    "the definitions of @xmath25 and @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 if @xmath30 and @xmath31 , equation ( [ stress ] ) will reduce to @xmath32 , which is the same as the @xmath4-prescription in @xcite .",
    "it means that equation ( [ stress ] ) contains the @xmath4-prescription as a trivial case .",
    "equation ( [ alpha - prof ] ) determines the dependence of @xmath4 on radius @xmath7 , bh mass @xmath33 and spin @xmath34 .",
    "the radial factor , including the exponent @xmath35 , was suggested by @xcite . under this profile , @xmath4 is almost a constant @xmath36 in outer disk region with large @xmath7 and increases to higher value radially inwards .",
    "we set @xmath37 and fix the mass supplying rate @xmath38 ( see table [ tab1 ] for the definition of eddington accretion rate , @xmath39 ) at the outer boundary in this work . in practice , these settings are sufficient to make the disk thermally unstable and we indeed observe the limit - cycle outburst from running code .    after defining @xmath17 , the viscous heating rate @xmath40 in equation ( [ energy ] )",
    "is redefined as @xmath41 which would be reduced to the one in @xcite when @xmath31 .",
    "we update our previous code established in @xcite and run it for eleven numerical models , whose parameters are listed in table [ tab1 ] . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied the impact of viscous time - delay on the thermal instability and found that it is not remarkable for small enough time - delay .",
    "indeed , we observe the expected limit - cycle outbursts on all models with the time delay parameters @xmath26 in the range @xmath42 to @xmath43 . therefore ,",
    "the time - delay implemented in our code does not affect the limit - cycle outbursts .    among these models ,",
    "s8 and s30 are two typical ones .",
    "s8 is a disk around a non - spinning black hole as well as s30 around a fast - spinning one . in figure",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] , we show the bolometric light curves for these two models respectively . for each point on light - curves ,",
    "the disk luminosity is made by integrating the local radiation cooling fluxes , and the sampling time corresponds to the frequency @xmath44 , which is enough to reveal any harmonic with frequency lower than @xmath45 in the power spectral density ( psd ) . due to the difficulties in hydrodynamical calculation ,",
    "we only obtain one outburst light curve for s8 and @xmath46-long luminosity ascending light curve for s30 .",
    "however , they are long enough for the calculation of psds . in figure",
    "[ fig : psds ] , we show the relevant psds for s8 and s30 .",
    "the fundamental frequency ( the lowest frequency of harmonics ) is @xmath47 for s8 and @xmath48 for s30 , which are both close to @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the respective maximal epicyclic frequencies , which are also the maximum predicted frequencies of axisymmetric oscillations in the trapped @xmath0-mode theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and a detailed relativistic analysis is ongoing by our colleague jir hork ) . the spectrum of axisymmetric ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "horizontal @xmath0-modes was recently computed by @xcite , who show that in addition to a discrete set of lower frequency modes which are trapped in the inner disk , there are modes of frequency very close to the maximal epicyclic frequency in which the oscillation is transmitted to the outer disk . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we also list the fundamental frequencies observed from the other oscillating models , which are all close to the theoretical values though they vary in a narrow frequency range .    in figure",
    "[ fig : onecycle ] , we show an oscillating cycle of model s8 for @xmath12 ( upper two panels ) and @xmath17 ( lower two panels ) .",
    "the oscillations arise near the inner boundary and propagate outwards . in the figure",
    ", one can follow the motion of individual wavelets .",
    "the negative @xmath12 denotes inflow and negative gradient of @xmath12 corresponds to the compression ( inflow speed of inner is slower than outer ) as well as positive gradient to the expansion ( inflow speed of inner is faster than outer ) .",
    "thus , any wavelet on the @xmath12-profiles can be divided into the compressed wave - front and expanded wave - rear regions .",
    "for example , the left - most wavelet on initial @xmath12-profile ( red curve in the upper - left panel ) can be divided into the wave - front ( between dashed and dash - dotted lines ) and wave - rear ( between solid and dashed lines ) regions .",
    "the relevant variation of @xmath17 , which is proportional to the viscous heating , is showed in the lower - left panel .",
    "@xmath17 ( as well as the viscous heating ) monotonously increases in compressed wave - front ( see the red curve between dashed and dash - dotted lines ) but it unceasingly increases after the maximal compression ( takes place at the dashed line ) and then decreases in the expanded wave - rear .",
    "this non - monotonicity of @xmath17 in wave - rear is due to the time - delay contained by equation [ stress ] .",
    "we deem that this is the phase relation between the viscous heat generation and disk oscillation , which implies the arise of sonic - point instability for @xmath0-mode oscillation @xcite .",
    "thus , we also deem that the oscillations actually arise near the sonic - point , which is included in our computational domain and very close to the inner boundary .",
    "in table [ tab1 ] , there are the other nine models with different viscous settings but with the same bh mass , bh spin and mass supply rate ( fixed accretion rate at the outer boundary ) as s8 .",
    "we only observe oscillations on the models with non - vanishing delay and large enough constant @xmath4 ( @xmath52 ) or @xmath4-profile .",
    "in fact , the effective value on the @xmath4-profile increases inwards from constant @xmath53 in outer disk region to the maximum @xmath54 at the inner boundary .",
    "thus , the impact of @xmath4-profile is similar to the large constant @xmath4 while it just becomes large enough near the origin of instability , sonic - point .",
    "the facts of these oscillating models imply that the large @xmath4 ( at least near sonic - point ) is a necessary condition for the arise of sonic - point instability as well as @xmath0-mode oscillation , which is consistent with the analysis of @xcite and @xcite .    on the other view",
    ", we note the effect of delay on the appearance of oscillations .",
    "the oscillating models with @xmath55 ( s7 and s8 ) have the oscillations during the whole outburst .",
    "the other oscillating models with @xmath56 ( s1 , s2 and s17 ) lose the oscillations in different luminosity stages .",
    "the models with @xmath57 ( s3 , s4 , and s16 ) have no any oscillation though they have large enough @xmath4 , while the disappearance of the oscillations on models s5 and s15 is due to the small @xmath4 .",
    "these facts imply that @xmath25 may be a favorable delay for oscillation excitation on the disk around a @xmath58 schwarzschild bh under the large @xmath4 . the last model in table [ tab1 ]",
    ", s30 is a special case for a fast - spinning kerr bh , which has another favorable delay @xmath59 .",
    "this may imply the dependence between the viscous time - delay and bh spin .    focusing on the luminosity of the oscillating models ,",
    "we observe oscillations only in the limit - cycle outburst state ( @xmath60 ) when the inner disk region has switched to slim disk mode . on the contrary",
    ", there is no any oscillation observed in the limit - cycle quiet state ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the hfqpo observations , but can not be compared with the sonic - point instability theory which does not discriminate between accretion rates .",
    "recently , the shearing box simulation of @xcite implied that the effective @xmath4 is enhanced by the vertical convection during the outburst , which is similar to the conception of @xcite .",
    "thus , larger @xmath4 required by the @xmath0-mode oscillation may be caused by the outburst , explaining why hfqpos are observed only in high luminosity state .    beside the fundamental harmonic",
    ", there are many overtones in both of the two spectra in figure [ fig : psds ] .",
    "the frequency ratio of fundamental harmonic and its overtones is a regular integer series , which is also observed by @xcite in their 2d - simulations ( in radial and azimuthal dimensions ) when the axisymmetric @xmath0-mode become dominant for large @xmath4 .",
    "however , no overtones are observed by @xcite .",
    "perhaps , this is due to their adopting of the viscous prescription with @xmath62 instead of @xmath63 in @xcite and our models .",
    "these interesting overtones may be potentially useful for explaining the observational qpo pairs , which are always in a specific integer frequency ratio .",
    "subsequently , the virtual observation from our numerical results will be logical and interesting .",
    "however , it would require more careful treatment .",
    "for example , the effective time - delay of arrival caused by the gravitational bending on the trajectories of emitted photons and the large observational view - angle , and effective blocking caused by the gravitational red - shift and the other shields .    as a rough evaluation for the effective time - delay of arrival",
    ", one can consider the observation from an almost edge - on disk , on which the photons emitted from two locations apart from distant @xmath64 at the same observer s time ( @xmath6 ) will arrive at the observer with the rough delay @xmath65 comparable with the period of @xmath49 ( our results presented in figures [ fig : lightcurves ] and [ fig : psds ] can be roughly regarded as from the face - on disks ) . the distant @xmath64 is comparable with the radius of outward wavelets propagating area , so it is possible to change observer s final view on the oscillation power spectrum .",
    "this also implies that the code for ray - tracing calculation on virtual observation must be time - dependent .    in order to roughly demonstrate the effective blocking",
    ", we calculate the light - curves without the radiation contribution from different inner cutting regions for the same model s8 and we show the relevant power spectra in figure [ fig:4psds ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the fundamental harmonic ( inside the rectangle in all four panels ) can not be easily removed from psds because of the outward propagation of the oscillation from sonic - point .",
    "it implies that the measurement of bh spin with hfqpo will be very robust even in a case when modulation of the innermost disk is not visible .",
    "so far , we have found some features of our model fortunately coinciding with the counterparts of hfqpo observations .",
    "all of these are only due to the adopting of a special evolutionary stress equation in our model , which mimics the viscous features induced from mhd simulations .",
    "however , our model still lacks some abilities for capturing various complicated features associated with the real accretion flows around bhs .",
    "in fact , it is almost impossible for seeing the oscillations during the whole outburst state ( like those in figure [ fig : lightcurves ] ) in real accretion flows .",
    "it is because the effective @xmath4 and viscous time - delay , determining the appearance of oscillations , is turbulent stochastic in real accretion flows though their expected values can be determined by certain laws .",
    "further more mhd simulations on the mean behaviors of effective turbulent viscosity is necessary for improving our understanding on accretion process around bhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also impossible for capturing the resonance between the radial and vertical oscillations suggested by @xcite , because our model is a vertically integrated model and there is only radial dependence reserved .",
    "the further analytic works and mhd simulations on the roles of radial and vertical oscillations are necessary for explaining the observational hfqpo pairs though our model has the intrinsic multi - frequency feature .",
    "in fact , the thermal instability required by our model is the theoretical one whose deviations from the observations have been found a decade ago @xcite . while the existence of thermal instability on the bh accretion disks is still an open issue at present , we only can adopt this theoretical thermal instability to produce the high luminosity outburst required by the oscillations in our model .",
    "we believe the plausibility of oscillations observed on our models though it is `` dancing '' on a poor - quality stage .",
