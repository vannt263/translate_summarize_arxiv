    "a healthy mature individual undergoes cellular replication and division in a variety of tissue types and blood cells .",
    "associated with these events is the shortening of repeat units at the ends of each chromosome called telomeres .",
    "telomeres were first recognized in the 1930 s as special structures capping the ends of chromosomes , the cell s genetic material .",
    "further research has identified telomeres to be important components in a variety of cellular processes , the most important being replication @xcite .",
    "cellular replication involves one cell dividing itself into two identical copies , each containing a full copy of the genetic material .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that a generational clock may be associated with the progressive shortening of the telomeres .",
    "the decreasing lengths of telomeres have been found to be involved in aging , with shorter telomeres associated with advanced age .",
    "there is a complicated and not always consistent association between telomere length and human diseases such as cancer @xcite .",
    "the replication of the cell s linear chromosomes is a inherently destructive process , in that each replication causes a shortening of the chromosome through a phenomenon known as the end - replication problem @xcite .",
    "cells are able to protect their ( coding ) genetic material by instead allowing telomeres to shorten @xcite .",
    "further , in the absence of particular proteins and processes ( discussed below ) there exists a limited number of such divisions before which the cell reaches the so - called hayflick limit @xcite .",
    "cells whose telomeres have been shortened to this critically short length are said to have reached replicative senescence .",
    "while almost all eukaryotic cells contain chromosomes and telomeres ( read : not mature red blood cells ) , there are only some cell types that are actively dividing throughout adulthood .",
    "other cells instead have lifetimes on the same order as the organism itself , and thus divide rarely or not at all .",
    "leukocytes , or white blood cells , are among the cell types that regularly divide .",
    "leukocytes encompass multiple different types of mono - nucleated blood cells including lymphocytes , _ viz . _",
    "b cells and t cells , as well as granulocytes .",
    "these cells are involved in the cellular component of immune response , and thus they experience large cellular turnover and are required to maintain large , dynamic populations .",
    "( the function and behaviour and , in fact , the names of these cells change with repeated sequences of replication . )",
    "the ease with which leukocytes can be extracted and analyzed , especially when compared to other rapidly dividing cell types , such as colon crypt cells , makes them the perfect subject for analyzing the hayflick limit and telomere length dynamics .",
    "all blood cells , white or red , originate as hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow .",
    "these stem cells are pluripotent , self - renewing cells capable of differentiating into unique types of hematopoietic progenitor cells , which then mature into peripheral blood cells @xcite .",
    "the hematopoietic stem cells are considered to be  immortal cells \" , and are believed to maintain their telomere length by means of the enzyme telomerase .",
    "the kinetics of b , nk and t cells , and other leukocytes has been studied extensively , and values have been obtained for their proliferation and the death rates . some estimated values are shown in table 1 .    .estimated values from the literature for the mitotic and death rates for ( memory ) t cells , ( memory ) b cells and ( neutrophiles ) granulocytes . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as cells divide and multiply the end - replication problem causes chromosomal shortening .",
    "the level of attrition in leukocytes has been measured and most estimates of the number of base pairs lost per division range from 50 to 100 bp , with the highest estimate at 120 bp / division @xcite .",
    "this value is not uniform across species or even between individuals , with the exact figure changing greatly between individuals and different cells types .",
    "leukocytes were found to be able to divide on average 23 times before reaching senescence @xcite .",
    "similiar to the amount of base pairs lost per cell division , the hayflick limit varies greatly among different cell types . for human fibroblasts between 14 and 29 divisions",
    "were observed , while for human embryos the limit was found to be between 35 and 63 divisions @xcite .",
    "the role of the telomerase enzyme is to elongate telomeres , effectively mitigating the effects of telomere shortening .",
    "it is composed of an rna structural protein complex termed terc ( hterc in humans ) and a catalytic protein complex known as tert ( htert in humans ) . as with all proteins , the function is dependent upon the structure .",
    "telomerase acts by positioning itself along the telomeric region of dna with its intrinsic strand of rna bases aligning with the @xmath1 overhang of the chromosome . in humans",
    "the alignment function is carried out by hterc .",
    "the intrinsic rna component , htert in humans , is a single strand of rna with base pairs which complement the nucleotides on the telomere . in the case of humans",
    "this corresponds to aauccc ; this * motif * is repeated roughly three times ( uracil replacing thymine in htert is not an issue , as both result in complimentary base pairing with adenine ) . using standard biological syntax the rna bases of htert would be expressed as @xmath2-aaucccaaucccaauccc-@xmath1 .",
    "the labeling is due to the fact that telomerase elongates in the @xmath2 to @xmath1 direction .",
    "this leads to the addition of a @xmath2-ttagggttagggttaggg-@xmath1 section being added to the overhang . dna polymerase then elongates the complimentary strand , thereby elongating the double stranded section of the telomere .",
    "the positioning of dna polymerase still requires an rna primer , which is not replaced , thus the @xmath1 overhang remains .",
    "the exact mechanism of this elongation was first elucidated in 1991 by greider @xcite .",
    "there are many approaches possible to model the complex biology of telomere dynamics , and a recent in - depth review of much of this work is included in a recently been published study @xcite .",
    "therefore , we refrain from providing an exhaustive listing of previously published work",
    ". of particular relevance to this paper are the models of itzkovitz _ et al _ @xcite and the revision of their model introduced by cyrenne and one of us @xcite .",
    "in particular , these models examined the various properties of a population of cells that underwent replication and death that included an index tracking the generational age of each cell .",
    "in this paper we extend these studies to include , in the simplest fashion possible , the effect of the telomere - elongating protein telomerase on such populations .",
    "the work of hirt _ et al _ @xcite , like our study , also incorporates telomerase into the modelling .",
    "it provides a detailed theory predicting the distribution of telomere lengths and its dependence on telomerase .",
    "however , unlike their work , our paper only seeks to provide the simplest possible mathematical representation of the role of the variable activity of telomerase on these dynamics .",
    "that is , we follow the number of cells of each generational age at a given chronological time . because of and in spite of the simplicity of our model , we are able to extract information regarding the dynamics that result if the expression of the telomerase enzyme exceeds a critical value",
    "further , we show , subject to the limitations of the coarse model we employ , that this critical value is not that different from the mitotic and cell death rates that are found in healthy cells .",
    "other models have identified cell immortality , and in an elegant fashion include the role of stochasticity , such as that of antal _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "however , here we study a different mechanism of telomere elongation , that is telomerase and not telomere sister chromatid exchange , and focus on how a divergence of cell population numbers are produced by the activity of telomerase .",
    "the literature includes ample qualitative discussion of telomerase levels in cancerous cells @xcite , as well as the repeated statement that in almost healthy ( non stem cell ) tissues the level of this enzyme is effectively zero @xcite .",
    "modern sequencing technology allows for precise quantitative statements to be made , with minimal effort , so here we provide such information regarding the levels of this enzyme .",
    "the results shown here are in whole or part based upon data generated by the tcga research network : http://cancergenome.nih.gov/. to be concrete , we have examined rnaseqv2 data from matched normal / tumour samples for several cancers : bladder , ovarian , prostate and breast .",
    "the raw rnaseq data were analysed by the tcga consortium using mapslice and rsem algorithms @xcite , and our conclusions are based on level 3 data . to be concrete , count",
    "data for 20,531 genes , annotated by rsem and entrez gene numbers , are obtained .",
    "for all cancers that we studied , quanlitatively and often quantitatively similar results were obtained .    to place the numbers discussed below in context , note that all samples examined had average gene expressions ( counts ) of between 900 and 1100 .",
    "the maximum gene expression counts , typically for some collagens and housekeeping genes , was of the order of 10@xmath3 .",
    "the count levels for @xmath4 and @xmath5 were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude less than the 10@xmath6 average expression level .",
    "a box - whisker plot of 18 matched normal / tumour samples for bladder cancer from tcga .",
    "the heavy solid lines denote the medians , the boxes are the 25 - 75 quartile range , the whiskers show 1.5 iqr in each direction , and the open circles are ( outlier ) data that lies outside of the range of the whiskers . the mean expression level ( denoted by gx ) in the tumours",
    "is found to be six times that of the matched normal samples .",
    "further , 7 out of the 18 normal samples have an ( effective ) expression level of zero.,width=340,height=264 ]    we found in all samples that the counts for the telomerase rna component , @xmath4 , were close to the lower detection level , usually of order one , and rarely as high as 10 .",
    "there is little difference in the @xmath4 gene expression counts between normal and tumour samples .",
    "however , the telomerase reverse transcriptase @xmath5 did show consistent changes between normal and tumour samples , with the tumours having a mean expression level between 3 and 6 times that of the associated normal samples .",
    "( a comprehensive examination of all of this data can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as one clear example , as of the time of the writing of this report there were 18 matched normal / tumour samples for bladder cancer at tcga . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bladderca ] a box - whisker plot of the expression data shows that one has a six - fold increase in the mean expression level for the tumours in comparison to the normal samples .",
    "further , in 17 of the 18 samples the expression level is higher in the tumour than the normal samples , whereas in the 18@xmath7 sample the expression levels are effectively equal .",
    "consistent with the literature , in 7 out of the 18 normal samples the expression level of @xmath5 is effectively zero .    below",
    "we proceed with the understanding that the presence of telomerase in samples is often associated with cancer , as supported by fig .",
    "[ fig : bladderca ] . experimental identification of the activity rate of the elongation telomeres by telomerase is presently difficult to obtain , but could perhaps be provided @xmath8 by florescently tagging telomeres , and then following their lengths using cytometry as a function of the concentration of @xmath5 .",
    "for the models presented in this paper , the biochemical species of interest are _ cells _ and _ telomerase proteins_. within an approximation explained below , a cell is characterized by its generational age .",
    "this is the difference in the number of times a cell has undergone mitosis and replication compared with the number of times it has been acted upon by telomerase .",
    "a cell species will be denoted by @xmath9 . the generational age is denoted by the subscript @xmath10 .",
    "when a cell undergoes mitosis its generational age increases by one ; that is @xmath11 .",
    "when a cell is acted upon by telomerase its generational age decreases by one ; that is @xmath12 . a cell s generational age can run from @xmath13 ( a newly differentiated cell ) to @xmath14 ( a senescent cell )",
    ". cell species of different generational age will be represented by @xmath15 , and the respective population of cells of each generational age is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "these cellular populations are a function of time and will be termed the _ subpopulation functions _ , @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .    a telomerase protein species is represented by @xmath19 .",
    "the telomerase population ( number of proteins ) is given by @xmath20 .",
    "then we denote the concentration of telomerase as @xmath21 in units of number per volume , or concentration .    the section of the telomeres that is lost during replication , and the lengths of telomeres that are regenerated via telomerase , are not constant or equal .",
    "previous mathematical modelling by cyrenne and one of us of a longitudinal study of baboons @xcite found lengths between 120 and 600 base pairs could be lost during mitosis .",
    "similar variations in the elongation by telomerase are expected - that is , there is a stochastic component to this biology .",
    "therefore , it is not _",
    "per se _ the number of mitotic divisions less the number of elongations that sets the hayflick limit , but rather a critical length of the telomeric region that induces replicative senescence . here",
    "we simplify our work without sacrificing the key result ( regarding a critical rate of telomerase activation giving rise to a divergent number of cells ) by taking the lengths of the telomeres lost during replication and the number of the ttaggg repeats added via the action of telomerase to be equal ( in total length , in terms of base pairs ) , and the hayflick limit to be determined by the net generational age of a cell .",
    "this approximation could change our result quantitatively , but not qualitatively , as we argue below .",
    "a comment on terminology is appropriate before proceeding .",
    "_ pristine cells _ are those with generational age of zero , @xmath22 or @xmath23",
    ". _ senescent cells _ are those which have reached the hayflick limit , @xmath24 or @xmath25 . _ permissive cells _ include all those that are not either pristine or senescent , @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "we refer to them as permissive because these cells _ permit _ mitosis and replication to occur , and consequently permit the total number of cells in the population to increase , the crucial element needed to make sense of our results .",
    "we now describe and model the relevant biochemical reactions that occur in a population of replicating cells .",
    "first , mitotic replication is taken to occur at a rate @xmath28 of replicative events per cell per unit time .",

    "@xmath32 as is made clear above , only @xmath33 cells can undergo mitosis , and the inability of a cell whose chromosomes have reached the hayflick limit to subsequently divide is often referred to as replicative senescence @xcite .",
    "acute death removes a cell from the derived population pool .",
    "this occurs at a rate @xmath34 of mortality events per cell per unit time .",

    "( [ subeq : death_reaction ] ) .",
    "@xmath35 note that in all reactions the null set @xmath36 denotes the lack of presence in the population pool of cells .",
    "cells of any generation are susceptible to acute death , and therefore these expressions are valid for @xmath37 .    the population pool is  filled \" via the differentiation of stem cells .",
    "the rate at which cells leave the stem cell population pool and enter the population pool is denoted by @xmath38 , and is in number of cells per unit time .",
    "collectively this results in the production of new @xmath23 cells and an increase in @xmath39 as shown below .",
    "@xmath40    through the previously discussed mechanisms , telomerase acts to  rejuvenate \" a cell at a rate @xmath41 per cell per unit time .",
    "the specific details as to what we choose to take as @xmath41 will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the net result is the onversion of a cell of generation @xmath10 , @xmath15 , to a cell of generation @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( it is in this sense that telomerase rejuvenates a cell - it makes it younger ) .",

    "( a model in which @xmath41 is the only non - zero rate is presented in the appendix . )",
    "we consider the system to be composed of these reactions with these _ average _ reaction rates .",

    "the telomerase concentration function , @xmath21 , can be described by the following first - order ordinary differential equation @xmath109 @xmath106 represents the rate of production of the enzyme in number of proteins per unit time , whereas @xmath107 represents the rate of degradation of the enzyme in number of proteins per unit time .",
    "we have taken the production and decay rates to be concentration independent ( although generalizations of this approach produce no important modifications to our results ) .",
    "we introduce a value we have termed _ the activation time _ and denote it as @xmath110 , and take it to represent the time when telomerase production begins , such as some time corresponding to the appearance of a neoplasia . defining @xmath111 and physically assuming @xmath112 gives @xmath113 \\theta \\left ( t - t_o \\right ) \\\\\\ ] ] clearly , after some time @xmath114 the concentration of telomerase is fixed to be + @xmath115 .",
    "now one must include the effect of this time dependence in the activity of telomerase .",
    "therefore we now introduce a new form of the telomerase rate _",
    "functional _ which implements an activator hill function , eq .",

    "a healthy post - puberty individual has a sufficiently small concentration of telomerase that we can approximate @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , a system of cells ( for some given tissue with a stem cell source of new @xmath118 cells ) reaches steady values of @xmath119 .",
    "then crisis occurs at @xmath120 , and quickly the rate @xmath41 increases and stabilizes at some new value .",

    "that is , in comparison to the results shown at the beginning of this section no qualitative change occurs , only the onset of the uncontrolled growth is shifted in time to @xmath122 .",
    "using the simplest model possible , we have incorporated the effect of telomerase being present in a cell s nucleus , thereby allowing it to elongate the telomeres of the cell s chromosomes .",
    "we have made many approximations in our treatment of this system , but none of them should influence our main result , namely that if the activity of telomerase exceeds some critical value then the total number of cells will be found to diverge as @xmath123 . in the parlance of the",
    "oft - quoted  hallmarks of cancer \" @xcite , these cells have obtained replicative immortality .",
    "the critical value , @xmath0 , that we find is similar in magnitude to the average rate of cell division ( mitosis ) @xmath28 , which is often similar but larger than the average rate of cell death @xmath34 .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite found a similar result , namely that the lengths of telomeres are elongated by telomerase , but only for unphysical levels of telomerase .",
    "our critical value seems to be physical in that the size of @xmath28 is an effective rate , one that incorporates many biological processes , and represents that all of hte breakpoints are traversed , which depend on many protein / enzyme levels , cell division occurs .",
    "if the population of cells with different telomere lengths is going to have an exponentially increasing number of total cells , bypassing the steady - state levels found in replicative senescence ( for our parameter values @xmath124 dominates the total number of cells in steady state ) , then telomere - elongation events must at least cancel out the byproducts of cell division , so finding @xmath125 is indeed the expected result .    our model ,",
    "the equations of motion for the average number of cells of each net generational age , is deterministic .",
    "however , no qualitative changes occur when one uses a stochastic simulation of the chemical master equation presented in this work ( we used the full gillespie simulation algorithm @xcite ) .",
    "details of such work , in combination with other biological processes important in the initiation of the cell cycle , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the biological implications of these mathematical results must be considered carefully .",
    "no cell lasts forever in a living organism , so @xmath63 is not a directly useful limit . instead",
    ", suppose that a healthy population of cells finds that a few cells obtain a replicative advantage , such as when a neoplasia forms .",
    "if the enzyme telomerase is activated in that population , then the advantaged cell wo nt necessarily be limited by the hayflick limit , since the role of telomerase is , in part , to make senescent cells become permissive of mitosis .",
    "that is , the results from the present model should be considered in terms of an increasing number of selectively advantaged tumour cells without bound .",
    "if such cells grow to some large size ( think of the grapefruit size tumour often found in women with ovarian cancer ) the consequences of some of these cells undergoing an epithelial - mesenchymal transition thereby possibly leading to distant metastatic cells is the life - determining upper bound in time imposed by the cancer .",
