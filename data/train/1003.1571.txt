    "fese @xcite and srfeasf @xcite have stimulated a great deal of activity on superconductors derived from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) parent compounds .",
    "this novel class of materials , besides existing cuprate - based high-@xmath7 superconductors , provides yet another system for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism . while for cuprates ,",
    "the cu - o planes are crucial to the superconducting ( sc ) behavior , in so - called @xmath8122@xmath8 iron - based superconductors , the feas layers play a similar role .",
    "suitable hole- or electron - doping as well as applied pressure can suppress both structural and magnetic transitions resulting in superconductivity with @xmath7 up to 55 k @xcite . due to the weak electron - phonon interactions and the emergence of superconductivity with a disappearance of the afm transition , spin fluctuations have been proposed to play a key role in establishing the sc state in these iron - based supercondcutors @xcite . however , in these compounds the afm state is strongly coupled to a lattice distortion and it is , therefore , important to unravel the interactions between lattice and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "[ htl ]    the parent compounds of _ _ a__fe@xmath0as@xmath0 adopt a tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0-type structure at room temperature and undergo a tetragonal- ( t ) to - orthorhombic ( o ) phase transition upon cooling .",
    "this transition is accompanied by an afm ordering with magnetic moments aligned parallel to the crystallographic _ a _ axis with a propagation vector along the [ 101 ] ( o notation ) direction ( fig .  [ structure ] ) .",
    "the majority of reports @xcite characterize the o - t transition as a first - order ( fo ) structural transition with small hysteresis , while some @xcite have argued that the accompanying afm transition seems to be continuous , or more difficult to characterize as first- or second - order .",
    "however , neutron - diffraction measurements of single - crystal cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 clearly show that the afm transition can be classified as a first - order transition with a @xmath91 k hysteresis @xcite .",
    "the synthesis , structure , and magnetic susceptibility measurements of srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 were reported by pfisterer @xcitein 1980 , where an anomaly in the susceptibility around 200 k was associated with an afm transition .",
    "this anomaly was further characterized as a fo transition at @xmath10 k in polycrystalline srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 samples by resistivity and specific - heat measurements @xcite .",
    "single - crystal studies of srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 showed a structural transition from a high - temperature t ( _ _ i__4/_mmm _ ) phase to a low - temperature o ( _ fmmm _ ) one at @xmath1 , simultaneously accompanied by the afm transition @xcite . the neutron - scattering study of a single - crystal srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( _ _ t__@xmath4 = 220 k ) @xcite determined that the afm spin direction is parallel to the crystalline _ a _ axis in _ fmmm _ symmetry and that the structural transition is first order , while the magnetic transition appears to be continuous .",
    "however , the hysteresis of both transitions was not reported .",
    "by contrast , a powder x - ray diffraction study reported that the _",
    "_ a__fe@xmath0as@xmath0 compounds ( _ a _ = ba , sr , ca ) undergo second - order displacive structural transitions @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction and resistivity measurements under pressure show that _ _",
    "t__@xmath4 shifts to lower temperatures and the transition is practically suppressed at a critical pressure range of 4 - 5 gpa . above 2.5 gpa , a significant decrease in resistivity below @xmath940 k indicates the appearance of superconductivity .",
    "40% co - doping on the iron site in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 results in the coexistence of superconductivity ( @xmath7 = 19.5 k ) and an afm state ( @xmath2 = 120 k ) @xcite , while 40 % -50 % substitution of the sr site by k and cs brings @xmath7 to 37 k @xcite . as mentioned above , the reported @xmath2 of srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 differs among studies , e.g. , 198 k ( single crystal ) @xcite , 200 k ( single crystal ) @xcite , 205 k ( polycrystal ) @xcite , and 220 k ( single crystal ) @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the subtle changes in feas layers resulting from different synthesizing processes , e.g. , the sn incorporation .",
    "[ htl ]    in order to clarify the link between magnetism and structure , both transitions have to be monitored simultaneously in one experiment .",
    "neutron scattering is an ideal technique for this kind of measurement .",
    "herein , we report a systematic elastic neutron scattering study on a single - crystal srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , focusing on the details of both magnetic and structural transitions especially close to the transition temperature .",
    "high - quality srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals were synthesized by the feas flux growth technique @xcite . the crystallinity and purity were characterized by laue back - scattering , x - ray powder diffraction , magnetization and resistivity measurements .",

    "the elastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out on the hb-1a fixed - incident - energy ( 14.6 mev ) triple - axis spectrometer using a double pyrolitic graphite ( pg ) monochromator ( high flux isotope reactor at the oak ridge national laboratory , usa ) .",
    "two highly oriented pg filters , one after each monochromator , were used to reduce the @xmath12/2 contamination .",

    "the appearance and disappearance of the afm ( 103)@xmath4 reflection and the o structure occur at exactly the same temperature range ( warming : 202 - 202.25 k ; cooling : 201.5 - 202 k ) [ figs.[lattparam]a@xmath13 and b@xmath13 ] , indicating a strong coupling of the two transitions .",
    "the difference of afm ( 103)@xmath4 between warming and cooling [ fig .",
    "[ lattparam]b ] is not expected from an ordinarily second - order phase transition .",
    "one reason for this difference can be the effect of intrinsic stress / pressure developing on the boundaries of twin domains as a result of the o distortion .",
    "such stress may have a similar effect as pressure , known to lower the afm transition temperature and even suppresses it @xcite .",
    "such an effect can lead , for example , to non - monotonic behavior of the order parameter with a monotonic variation in temperature . the field cooling ( fc ) , zero fc and heat treatments also have a strong influence on the magnetic susceptibility in this afm phase @xcite .",
