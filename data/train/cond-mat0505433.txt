    "as spectroscopic data using a variety of experimental techniques is becoming available at an ever increasing pace , there is great need to develop efficient methods for calculating electronic excitation energies in wide classes of materials .",
    "the gw approximation ( gwa ) has been the traditional route for addressing this problem @xcite .",
    "the gwa however is computationally quite intensive , which makes the routine application of the gwa in electronic structure computations difficult and for this reason gwa results have to date been limited largely to relatively simple systems .    with this motivation , in a previous study  @xcite ,",
    "we have attempted to develop a simplified scheme for obtaining quasi - particle energies by correcting the eigenvalues @xmath0 given by the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite with a state - dependent correction @xmath1 associated with the self - energy @xmath2 of the exchange - correlation hole surrounding each electron .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained within other extensions of the dft @xcite , which have been shown to describe the energy gaps in semiconductors with an accuracy comparable to that of the gwa .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to generalize the unpolarized case considered in ref .   to include spin - polarization effects .",
    "we also address the treatment of self - interaction corrections in systems with localized @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals and suggest a scheme for handling metallic systems with partially filled bands of @xmath3 or @xmath4 character .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction is followed in section  ii by a brief explanation of the relevant pair - correlation functions and their role in evaluating self - energies .",
    "the spin - resolution of the exchange and correlation energies is developed in section  iii .",
    "a somewhat more general formulation of our scheme is taken up in section  iv which also presents illustrative results in cu .",
    "finally , section  v makes a few concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the elements @xmath5 of the two - particle density matrix , where @xmath6 is the total number of electrons and @xmath7 is the ground state wavefunction of the many body electronic system .",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath8 is then defined via the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the electron density and the correlation factor @xmath11 is defined by the second equality . for an uncorrelated system @xmath12 , or equivalently , @xmath13 .",
    "two effects must now be considered , namely , exchange and correlation .",
    "the antisymmetry of the many electron wavefunction @xmath7 prevents electrons of the same spin to come too close to one another and creates an exchange hole around each electron .",
    "the associated exchange energy is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the exchange energy per particle and @xmath16 is the exchange contribution to the pair correlation @xmath17 of eq .",
    "the factor of @xmath18 accounts for double counting of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "thus , the exchange energy per particle @xmath19 can readily be interpreted as the coulomb interaction of an electron at @xmath20 with its exchange hole . for the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) of density @xmath21 , @xmath16 and @xmath22",
    "have well - known analytical expressions @xmath23 and @xmath24 and , in particular , the familiar hartree - fock - slater ( hfs ) potential is given by @xcite @xmath25 here the factor of @xmath26 arises from the fact that variations with respect to a trial wavefunction of the form of a slater determinant yield a potential term in one - particle equations which is twice as large as the corresponding energy term @xmath22 .",
    "the dft within the local density approximation ( lda ) provides a remarkably similar scheme in which the electron density @xmath10 is treated as the variational parameter@xcite .",
    "the exchange hole is still described by the pair correlation function between like spin electrons , but the exchange potential @xmath27 differs from the hfs potential by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "coulomb repulsion between electrons is an additional effect responsible for electron motions to become correlated . as a result",
    ", there also appears a correlation hole around each electron , which is dominated by electrons of opposite spin , since the like spin electrons are already excluded via the exchange hole .",
    "the correlation hole is generally less deep compared to the exchange hole , especially at high electron densities .",
    "note that the exchange hole goes to zero at the origin and excludes a total of one electron worth of charge in order to correct for self - interaction terms .",
    "in contrast , the correlation hole integrates to zero and involves only a redistribution of charge @xcite .",
    "a number of intuitive schemes for treating the exchange and correlation holes have been proposed , where the pair correlation functions are determined from a schrodinger equation for an electron pair with appropriate boundary conditions.@xcite such models are useful for generalizing the lda by improving the description of exchange and correlation in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "note , however , that in going beyond the lda , a distinction should be made between theories which attempt to find better energy functionals but still lie within the framework of the dft , and those theories which focus on the self - energy @xmath2 in order to obtain better quasiparticle energies .",
    "the present scheme belongs to the latter category where the excitation energies are given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the kohn - sham orbital @xmath31 , and @xmath1 is a state - dependent correction associated with the self - energy @xmath2 . by using a particular ansatz for @xmath2 , we have previously proposed@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the kohn - sham potential and @xmath34 is the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy per particle @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of the pair correlation functions as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the coupling constant from the hellmann - feynman theorem . within the lda",
    ", @xmath38 is a well - known function of the local density @xmath10 obtained from homogeneous electron gas results @xcite .",
    "in the spin resolved case , the prescription for the correction to the excitation energy given by eq .  [ eq_sigman ] becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spin - dependent dft potential and @xmath41 the spin - resolved electron density . as in eq .",
    "11 above , the exchange - correlation energy per particle @xmath42 is given by the coulomb interaction of an electron of spin @xmath43 at @xmath20 with its exchange - correlation hole : @xmath44 in terms of the spin - resolved correlation functions @xmath45 .",
    "it is convenient to split @xmath42 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 give the exchange and correlation components of @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the spin - resolution of @xmath49 is straightforward because the exchange hole only involves like spin electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - resolution of @xmath50 is more subtle since here both like and unlike spin electrons contribute .",
    "the energy per particle for the spin polarized heg depends only on the density parameter @xmath51 and the local spin polarization @xmath52    in this connection , the spin - resolution of the correlation energy presented recently by gori - giorgi and perdew @xcite for the heg may usefully be employed .",
    "ref .   defines spin resolved correlation energies @xmath53 by using correlation holes @xmath54 , where the pair correlation function @xmath55 has been averaged over the coupling strength @xmath37 .",
    "here we have made the dependence of various quantities on @xmath51 and @xmath56 explicit .",
    "thus the interaction energy @xmath57 of an electron of spin @xmath43 with its correlation hole can be resolved as @xmath58 parameterized expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 based on the heg are given in ref .",

    "in contrast , the correlation energy per particle of the minority spin electrons does not vanish in the limit @xmath64 due to the contribution of opposite spin electrons in eq .",
    "the effect of correlations is to reduce the @xmath56 dependency of @xmath49 . as a result",

    "it is clear immediately that correlations yield a less attractive hole for the majority spins compared to that for the minority spins .",
    "the reason is that correlation effects are dominated by the contribution of opposite spin electrons which are not prevented by the pauli principle to come close to each other .",
    "the splitting of the two surfaces increases with increasing spin polarization @xmath56 but decreases with increasing @xmath51 . at @xmath70",

    "this formulation also allows us to connect our approach to some related methods in the literature . in the interest of notational simplicity",
    ", we will omit from hereon the obvious spin dependencies and the associated spin - indices .",
    "we recall that the standard definition of the the self - energy operator @xmath2 is : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the exact single - particle green s function and @xmath77 is the reference green s function obtained within the hartree approximation .",
    "thus @xmath2 in principle contains all quasiparticle effects beyond the hartree approximation .",
    "we now write @xmath2 ( suppressing spin - indices ) as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the spin - dependent exchange - correlation potential associated with the spin - dependent kohn - sham orbitals @xmath31 .",

    "[ eq_sigmans ] and it can be the basis for curing the unphysical interaction of an electron with itself which occurs in the dft .",

[ eq_sigmans ] attempts to correct for such self - interactions by using the coulomb potential of the exchange - correlation hole , but does so only approximately since it assumes every electron to possess the same pair - correlation function . in systems with localized orbitals , it makes sense to subtract out the self - interaction for each occupied orbital explicitly by using@xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the electrostatic and the exchange - correlation potential , respectively , created by the charge density @xmath83 . the self - interaction correction ( sic ) given by eq .",
    "[ eq_sic ] has been proposed by perdew and zunger @xcite for atomic systems and possesses a straightforward spin - dependence . for atoms",
    ", sic lowers the lda eignevalues and improves agreement with measurements@xcite .",
    "note , however , that in extended systems sic encounters conceptual problems due to the delocalized character of the bloch functions.@xcite in fact , the sic correction turns to be zero for plane - waves .",
    "a route around this problem is to renormalize the wavefunction within the unit cell and perform the correction within the atomic spheres.@xcite    the so - called lda+u can be considered a simplified version of the sic where the correction @xmath84 acts only on localized @xmath3-or @xmath4-states , often splitting the metallic lda bands into upper and lower hubbard bands descriptive of mott - hubbard insulators @xcite .",
    "however , problems with both sic and the lda+u arise for systems with partially filled 3@xmath3 shells which are metallic , as for example in the transition metals.@xcite in order to handle cases where a conduction band crosses the fermi energy @xmath85 , we observe first that here the dft potential @xmath79 generally provides a reasonable approximation to the self - energy at the fermi surface ( fs ) @xcite and we may impose the condition @xmath86 on the self - energy .",
    "we now write @xmath1 as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is defined to be the average correction on the fs and @xmath89 is a state - dependent contribution .",
