    "over the past years there has been a rapidly growing interest in trying to understand the mechanism of nonequilibrium transport on the basis of dynamical systems theory @xcite .",
    "one line of work is related to computer simulations , where interacting many - particle systems under nonequilibrium conditions , like shear or an external field , are in the center of the investigations @xcite .",
    "another line of research focuses on low - dimensional models like the random @xcite or periodic @xcite lorentz gas . an even simpler model which shares certain properties of the periodic lorentz gas are two - dimensional multibaker maps @xcite .",
    "lorentz gases and multibaker maps have become standard models in the field of chaos and transport , since , on the one hand , they catch the physical essence of certain real nonequilibrium processes , but , on the other hand , they are still simple enough such that they can be analyzed in detail theoretically . the final point along this line of reduction of complexity is the problem of deterministic diffusion in one - dimensional maps , as it has first been studied by grossmann and fujisaka @xcite , by geisel et al.@xcite , and by schell , fraser , and kapral @xcite .",
    "later , methods of cycle expansion @xcite and other techniques have been applied to this and related questions @xcite .",
    "the most interesting problem in this context is to describe the dependence of deterministic diffusion on varying a single parameter value .",
    "however , for computing parameter - dependent diffusion coefficients so far either the deterministic dynamics could not be treated in full detail , and thus the results were approximative , or the task could be performed exactly only for a few simple cases of parameter values .    the idea of this article is to apply methods of dynamical systems theory , as discussed by gaspard et al .",

    ", we will explain the term deterministic diffusion , and we will define the class of dynamical system we want to analyze . in section [ txt : fpm ] , some important background of our approach will be discussed briefly , and in section [ txt : sfp ] , a method will be presented which enables the exact computation of deterministic diffusion coefficients for a broad range of parameter values .",
    "the result for the diffusion coefficient of the simple map considered here turns out to be surprisingly complex so that additional investigations , performed in section [ txt : fdk ] , are required to understand the origin of this unexpected non - trivial diffusive behavior .",

    "@xcite , chapter 2 , a brief summary has been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in a first approach",
    ", one may think about diffusion as a simple non - correlated _ random walk _",
    "@xcite , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : rwdif ] : one starts by choosing an initial position @xmath0 of a point particle on the real line , e.g. , @xmath1 , as shown in the figure .",
    "the dynamics of the particle is then determined by fixing a probability density @xmath2 such that @xmath3 gives the transition probability @xmath4 for the particle to travel from its old position @xmath0 over a distance @xmath5 to its new position @xmath6 . the same procedure can be applied to any further change in the position of the particle . for sake of simplicity , it is assumed that @xmath2 is symmetric with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity of interest is here the orbit of the moving particle , which is represented by a collection of points @xmath8 on the real line .",
    "@xmath9 refers to the discrete time , which is given by the number of iterations , or `` jumps '' , of the particle .    for performing a simple non - correlated random walk",
    ", it is assumed that the probability density @xmath2 is independent of the position @xmath10 of the particle and of the discrete time @xmath9 , i.e. , it is fixed in time and space .",
    "in other words , there is _ no history _ in the dynamics of the particle , that is , the single iteration steps are _ statistically independent _ from each other .",
    "this is called a _",
    "markov process _ in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "such a random walk can be used as a simple model for diffusion : one starts with an ensemble of particles at , e.g. , @xmath1 , and applies the iteration procedure introduced above to each particle .",
    "if one separates the real line into a number of subintervals of size @xmath11 , the number @xmath12 of particles in any such small interval after @xmath9 iterations can be counted .",
    "divided by the total number @xmath13 of particles , these results determine the probability density @xmath14 for a sufficiently large number of particles .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as the probability to find one particle at a displacement @xmath15 after @xmath9 iterations .",
    "thus , @xmath14 provides information about the _ macroscopic _ distribution of an ensemble of particles , or of the average position of one particle , respectively .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 can now be obtained from the second moment of the probability density @xmath14 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the probability density average . if the probability densities are gaussians , the diffusion coefficient of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rwdk ] ) is well - defined .",
    "this is the case for a _",
    "diffusion process as the one modeled here by a simple random walk .",
    "in contrast to this traditional picture of diffusion as an uncorrelated random walk , the theory of dynamical systems makes it possible to treat diffusion as a _ deterministic dynamical process _ : here , the orbit of a point particle with initial condition @xmath0 may be generated by a _",
    "chaotic dynamical system _",
    "@xmath19 @xmath20 is a one - dimensional map which determines how a particle gets mapped from position @xmath10 to position @xmath21 , as will be introduced in detail below .",
    "the map @xmath20 plays now the role of the model - inherent probability density @xmath2 of the previous random walk : defining @xmath20 together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddex ] ) gives the full microscopic equations of motion of the system .",
    "thus , the decisive new fact which distinguishes this dynamical process from the one of a simple uncorrelated random walk is that here @xmath21 is _ uniquely determined _ by @xmath10 rather than having a distribution of @xmath21 for a given @xmath10 .",
    "this way , the _ complete history _ of the particle is taken into account .",
    "if the resulting macroscopic process of an ensemble of particles , governed by a deterministic dynamical system like map @xmath20 , turns out to obey a law like eq.([eq : rwdk ] ) , i.e. , if a diffusion coefficient exists for the system , this process is denoted as _ deterministic diffusion _ @xcite .",
    "[ fig : model ] shows the model which shall be studied in the following .",
    "this model has apparently first been introduced by grossmann and fujisaka @xcite .",
    "it depicts a `` chain of boxes '' which continues periodically in both directions to infinity , and the orbit of a moving point particle .",
    "let @xmath22 be a map modelling the chain of boxes introduced above , i.e. , a _ periodic continuation _ of _ discrete one - dimensional piecewise linear@xcite expanding maps _ with _ uniform slope_. the index @xmath23 denotes a control parameter , which is the absolute value of the slope of the map , @xmath10 is the position of a point particle , and @xmath9 labels the discrete time .",
    "since the map is expanding , i.e. @xmath24 , its lyapunov exponent @xmath25 is greater than zero .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is dynamically instable and may in this sense be called chaotic @xcite . in order for the map to be chaotic and piecewise linear",
    ", it can not be monotonic , so there must be points of discontinuity and/or non - differentiability .",
    "the term `` chain '' in the characterization of @xmath26 can be made mathematically more precise as a _ lift of degree one _ , @xmath27 for which the acronym _",
    "old _ has been introduced @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath26 is to a certain extent translational invariant . being _",
    "old _ , the full map @xmath26 is generated by the map of one box , e.g. , on the unit interval @xmath28 , which will be referred to as the _ box map_. it shall be assumed that the graph of this box map is point symmetric with respect to the center of the box at @xmath29 .",
    "this implies that the graph of the full map @xmath26 is anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath30 , @xmath31 so that there is no `` drift '' in the chain of boxes .",
    "for convenience , the class of maps defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cob ] ) , ( [ eq : lft ] ) , and ( [ eq : sym ] ) shall be denoted as _ class @xmath32 _ ( where @xmath33 stands for piecewise linear ) , and maps which fulfill the requirements of class @xmath32 shall be referred to as _",

    "[ fig : model ] , which contains a section of a simple class @xmath32-map , the box map has been chosen to @xmath34 cf .",
    "this example can be best classified as a _",
    "lorenz map with escape _ @xcite .",
    "the chaotic dynamics of these maps is generated by a `` stretch - split - merge''-mechanism for a density of points on the real line @xcite . as a class @xmath32-map , eq.([eq : mapa ] ) , together with eqs.([eq : cob ] ) , ( [ eq : lft ] ) , and ( [ eq : sym ] ) , will be referred to as map @xmath35 .",
    "other class @xmath32-maps have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , another example is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite to look at the dynamics in this chain of boxes in analogy to the process of _ brownian motion _",
    "@xcite : if a particle stays in a box for a few iterations , its _ internal _ box motion is supposed to get randomized and may resemble the microscopic fluctuations of a brownian particle , whereas its _ external _ jumps between the boxes could be interpreted as sudden `` kicks '' the particle suffers by some strong collision .",
    "this suggests that `` jumps between boxes '' contribute most to the actual value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "brownian motion is usually described in statistical physics by introducing some stochasticity into the equations which model a diffusion process .",
    "the main advantage of the simple model discussed here is that diffusion can be treated by taking the full dynamics of the system into account , i.e. , the _ complete orbit _ of the moving particle is considered , without any additional approximations .",
    "this is another way to understand the notion of deterministic diffusion in contrast to diffusion as obtained from stochastic approaches .",
    "that is , in the purely deterministic case the orbit of the particle is immediately fixed by determining its initial condition .",
    "one should note that the strength of diffusion , and therefore the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient , are related to the probability of the particle to escape out of a box , i.e. , to perform a jump into another box .",
    "this escape probability , however , as well as the average distance a particle travels by performing such a jump , changes by varying the system parameter .",
    "the problem which will be solved in the following is to develop a general method for computing parameter - dependent diffusion coefficients @xmath36 for class @xmath33-maps . here",
    ", map @xmath35 will serve as a simple example .",
    "however , the methods to be presented should work as well for any other class @xmath32-map , supposedly with analogous results ( see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the methodology of first passage , as it has been developed in the framework of statistical physics @xcite , deals with the calculation of decay- or escape rates for ensembles of statistical systems with certain boundary conditions . in recent work by gaspard et al .",

    "this approach is quite well - known , especially in the mathematical literature @xcite and has been employed by many authors for the calculation of dynamical systems quantities @xcite .",

    "[ fig : mp4 ] , supplemented by periodic boundary conditions .",

    "to solve the frobenius - perron equation , the key idea is to write this equation as a matrix equation @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , one needs to find a suitable _ partition _ of the map , i.e. , a decomposition of the real line into a set of subintervals , called _",
    "elements _ , or _ parts _ of the partition .",
    "the single parts of the partition have to be such that they do not overlap except at boundary points , which are referred to as _ points of the partition _ , and that they cover the real line completely @xcite . in case of slope @xmath58 , such a partition",

    "[ fig : mp4 ] represents a two - dimensional image of the one - dimensional partition introduced above , which is generated by the application of the map .",

    "[ fig : mp4 ] uniformly . by applying the map",
    ", one observes that points of this interval get mapped two - fold on the interval in the second box again , but that there is also escape from this box which covers the third and the first box intervals , respectively . since map @xmath35 is _ old _ , this mechanism applies to any box of the chain of chainlength @xmath42 , modified only by the boundary conditions .",
    "taking into account the stretching of the density by the slope @xmath23 at each iteration , this leads to a matrix equation of @xmath63 where for @xmath58 the @xmath42 x @xmath42-transition matrix @xmath64 can be constructed to @xmath65 the matrix elements in the upper right and lower left edges are due to periodic boundary conditions and reflect the motion of points from the @xmath42th box of the chain to the first one and _",
    "vice versa_.    in eq.([eq : fpm ] ) , the transition matrix @xmath66 is applied to a column vector @xmath67 of the probability density @xmath14 which , in case of @xmath58 , can be written as @xmath68 where `` @xmath69 '' denotes the transpose , and @xmath70 represents the component of the probability density in the @xmath71th box , @xmath72 , @xmath70 being constant on each part of the partition .    in case of @xmath58 ,",
    "the transition matrix is symmetric and can be diagonalized by spectral decomposition . solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath64 , respectively , one obtains @xmath76 is an initial probability density vector and @xmath77 is the lyapunov exponent of the map .",
    "note that the choice of initial probability densities is restricted by this method to functions which can be written in the vector form of eq.([eq : pdvec ] ) . for matrices of the type of @xmath64 ,",

    "analogously , for discrete time @xmath9 and chainlength @xmath42 to infinity , one obtains for the probability density @xmath14 of the frobenius - perron equation ,",

    "note that the largest eigenvalue is equal to the slope of the map so that for the first term in eq.([eq : pd4a ] ) the exponential vanishes , and one obtains a uniform equilibrium density .",
    "apart from generic discretization effects in the time and position variables , which may be neglected in the limit of time to infinity and after a suitable spatial coarse graining , the eigenmodes of eqs.([eq : f2sa ] ) and ( [ eq : pd4a ] ) match precisely so that , according to eq.([eq : erf1 ] ) , the diffusion coefficient @xmath81 can be computed to @xmath86 this result is identical to what is obtained from a simple random walk model @xcite . the procedure can be generalized straightforward to all even integers values of the slope , as is shown in app .",

    "a slightly more complicated example is the case of slope @xmath88 , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , which will be treated in the following .",

    "can be determined , given schematically by @xmath91 note that , in contrast to the case of @xmath58 , here the matrix is formed by submatrix _ blocks _ which move periodically to the right every two rows . since the partition of @xmath88 is a bit more complicated than for @xmath58 , the blocks refer to the partition of each box , whereas the shift again is related to the lift property of the _ old _ map .",
    "the matrix @xmath90 is not symmetric .",
    "however , the eigenvalue problem of this matrix can still be solved analogously to the case of @xmath58 ( see app .  [ app : dkpbc ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of the matrix turns out to be highly degenerate , and therefore @xmath90 can not be simply diagonalized anymore @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the matrix @xmath90 is _ non - normal _ , i.e. , @xmath92 , which means that it does not provide a system of orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "of course still a transformation onto jordan normal form to `` block - diagonalize '' this matrix could be applied .",
    "however , this seems to be more useful for proving mathematical theorems than for analytical calculations of diffusion coefficients @xcite . since the probability density of the frobenius - perron equation",
    "is determined by iteration of transition matrices , cf .",
    "( [ eq : fpm ] ) , for slope @xmath88 it is not in advance clear how the single eigenmodes `` mix '' in the limit time and chainlength to infinity and whether they can be matched to the solutions of the diffusion equation as before so that the diffusion coefficient @xmath93 is again simply determined by the second largest eigenvalue of the matrix .",
    "this problem will first be approached pragmatically .",
    "analogously to the analytical solutions of eqs .",

    "thus , although straightforward diagonalization and , therefore , a simple solution of the frobenius - perron equation like eq .",
    "( [ eq : pd4 ] ) are not possible anymore , the largest eigenmodes of @xmath90 behave correctly in the sense of the phenomenological diffusion equation so that it is suggestive to compute the diffusion coefficient @xmath93 via the second largest eigenvalue of @xmath90 again . with @xmath94",
    "see app .",
    "[ app : dkpbc ] , and eq.([eq : erf1 ] ) , one gets @xmath95 as for @xmath58 , this result is obtained as well from a simple random walk model .",
    "however , to produce this value , the respective random walk has to be defined in a slightly different way than for @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "analogously to the case of even integer slopes , the exact calculations can be generalized to all odd integer values of the slope and lead to ( see app .  [ app : dkpbc ] ) @xmath96 which again is identical to the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .    before this approach will be extended to other parameter values of the slope in the following section , some details will be discussed which are closely related to the calculations above : a special feature of the diffusion coefficient results for integer slopes shall be pointed out ; further limits of this method with respect to generalized diffusion coefficients shall be critically discussed ; and the application of the method to absorbing boundary conditions shall be briefly outlined .",
    "( [ eq : dkr4 ] ) and ( [ eq : dkr3 ] ) show already that @xmath97 , which is at first sight counterintuitive . by evaluating the general formulas of @xmath36 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dkre ] ) and ( [ eq : dkro ] ) at other even and odd integer slopes , one realizes that this inequality reflects a general oscillatory behavior of @xmath36 at integer slopes .",
    "this result has already been obtained by fujisaka and grossmann @xcite , but it has not been discussed in further detail in their work . a similar oscillatory behavior has been observed for deterministic diffusion in certain classes of two - dimensional maps @xcite .",
    "this behavior can not be understood completely by one consistent simple random walk model @xcite .",
    "there appear serious problems in trying to extend the matching eigenmodes procedure to arbitrarily low eigenmodes , even in case of @xmath58 , where the matrix is diagonalizable .",
    "with eq.([eq : ewp4 ] ) , one can check that @xmath98 i.e. , in contrast to the @xmath99 eigenmodes of the diffusion equation eq.([eq : f2 ] ) , the frequency of the eigenmodes of @xmath64 does not increase monotonically with @xmath99 , but gets `` flipped over '' at the ( @xmath100)th ( for @xmath42 even ) eigenmode such that the first and the last half of the number of eigenmodes are identical , except a minus sign .",
    "this is due to the discretization of the position variable @xmath15 in the diffusion equation to @xmath71 in the frobenius - perron _ matrix _",
    "equation eq.([eq : fpm ] ) , which was one of the basic ingredients for the possibility to construct transition matrices .",
    "moreover , one should note that , according to eq.([eq : ewp4 ] ) , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath64 is equal to zero . for @xmath90 , a large number of eigenvalues",
    "are even less than zero ( see eq.([eq : oddev ] ) in app .",
    "[ app : dkpbc ] for @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , except for the first few largest eigenmodes , which still match reasonably well to the eigenmodes of the diffusion equation in the limit time @xmath9 and chainlength @xmath42 to infinity , one can not expect the method to work simply that the components of a `` time - dependent '' diffusion coefficient @xmath101 are determined by smaller eigenvalues of the transition matrices in straight analogy to eq.([eq : erf1 ] ) .",
    "this could be taken as a hint that , to obtain more details of the dynamics , refined methods are needed .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the first orders of a position - dependent diffusion coefficient have been determined for a class @xmath32-map according to a procedure which avoids the discretization of the real line .",
    "the same procedure as outlined for periodic boundary conditions can also be employed for absorbing boundaries .",
    "it shall be sketched briefly , according to the three steps distinguished before :    : the one - dimensional diffusion equation with absorbing boundary conditions can be solved to @xmath102 with @xmath103 denoting again the fourier coefficients .    : the transition matrices for @xmath58 and @xmath88 at these boundary conditions are identical to the ones of eqs.([eq : tm4]),([eq : tm3 ] ) , except that the matrices now contain zeroes as matrix elements in the upper right and lower left corners . however , due to this slight change in their basic structure there is no general method to solve the eigenvalue problems for this type of matrices anymore , in contrast to the case of periodic boundary conditions . at least for @xmath88 and @xmath58 ,",
    "it is still possible to obtain analytical solutions by straightforward calculations analogous to the ones performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see app.[app : dkabc ] ) , but for any higher integer value of the slope even these basic methods fail .",
    "this appears to be caused by strong boundary layers .",
    "[ fig : emabc ] shows numerical solutions for the largest eigenmodes of the first odd integer slope transition matrices in comparison to the solutions of the diffusion equation eq.([eq : f2 ] ) ( details of the numerics applied here are given in the following section ) .",
    "it can be seen that near the boundaries , there are pronounced deviations between the frobenius - perron and the diffusion equation solutions .",
    "these deviations are getting smaller in the interior region of the chain , but are gradually getting stronger with increasing the value of the slope , as is shown in the magnification .",
    "the same behavior can be found for even integer slopes , although the quantitative deviation of these eigenmodes from the ones of the diffusion equation solutions is slightly less than for odd values of the slope .",
    "thus , obviously absorbing boundary conditions disturb the deterministic dynamics significantly , whereas similar effects do not occur for periodic boundary conditions , which therefore could be characterized as a kind of `` natural boundary conditions '' for this periodic dynamical system .    :",
    "the different boundary conditions do not only show up in the eigenmodes of the transition matrices , but also in the calculation of the diffusion coefficients . in analogy to periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the escape rate of the dynamical system at @xmath88 and @xmath58 is determined to @xmath104 with @xmath105 being the largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix ( see app .",

    ", the choice of simple partitions enabled the construction of transition matrices .",
    "these matrices provided a way to solve the frobenius - perron equation in a certain limit .",
    "however , so far this method has only been applied to very special cases of map @xmath35 , defined by integer slopes .",
    "this raises the question whether an extension of this method to other values of the slope is possible . for this purpose",
    ", the idea of choosing a suitable partition of the map has to be generalized .",
    "taking a look at fig.[fig : mp4 ] again , one observes that the graph of the map `` crosses '' or `` touches '' a vertical line of the grid only at some grid points .",
    "furthermore , the local extrema of the map , which are here identical to the points of discontinuity , are situated on , or just `` touch '' horizontal lines of the grid , whereas other crossovers of horizontal lines occur at no specific point .",
    "the same characteristics can be verified , e.g. , for the respective partition of slope @xmath88 .",
    "these conditions ensure that it is possible to obtain a correct transition matrix from a partition , since to be modeled by a matrix , a density of points , which covers parts of the partition completely , has to get mapped in a way that its image again covers parts of the partition completely , and not partially .",
    "this basic property of a `` suitable partition to construct transition matrices '' is already the essence of what is known as a _ markov partition _ :    for one - dimensional maps , a partition is a markov partition if and only if parts of the partition get mapped again onto parts of the partition , or onto unions of parts of the partition @xcite .",
    "[ def : mpv ]    a more formal definition of one - dimensional markov partitions , as well as further details , can be found in refs .",
    "the next goal must be to find a general rule of how to construct markov partitions for map @xmath35 at other , non - trivial parameter values of the slope .",
    "because of the periodicity of the chain of maps it suffices to find a markov partition for a single _ box map _ , i.e. , for the respective map in one box without applying the modulus to restrict it onto the unit interval . here",
    ", the fact can be used that the extrema , which are the _ critical points _ of the box map , have to touch horizontal lines , as explained before , which means that to obtain a markov partition the extrema have to get mapped onto partition points . since",
    "any box map of map @xmath35 is symmetric with respect to the point @xmath29 , the problem reduces to considering only one of the extrema in the following , e.g. , the maximum . changing the height of the maximum corresponds to changing the slope of the map . therefore , if one needs to find markov partitions for parameter values of the slope , one can do it the other way around by the following _ markov condition _ :    [ def : mcv ] for map @xmath35 , markov partition values of the slope are determined by choosing the slope such that the maximum of the box map gets mapped onto a point of the partition again .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpex ] , four examples of non - trivial markov partitions for map @xmath35 are depicted with respect to their box maps .",
    "one may check that the handwaving conditions which have been extracted from the integer slope examples to motivate definition [ def : mpv ] are fulfilled and especially that the partitions shown in the figure obey the markov partition definition [ def : mpv ] .",
    "the detailed structure of the partitions can be arbitrarily complex . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpex ] ( a ) and ( b ) a special orbit has been marked by bold black lines with arrows .",
    "it represent what will be called the _ generating orbit _ of a markov partition : for the two examples shown here , the starting point of this orbit is given by the maximum of the preceding box map , since this maximum must also be a partition point .",
    "the iterations of this orbit , as indicated by the arrows in the figure , define the single partition points .",
    "this way , the number of partition parts is related to the number of iterations of the generating orbit . in case of fig.[fig : mpex ] ( a ) and ( b ) the orbit is eventually periodic , i.e. , it finally gets mapped onto the fixed point @xmath30 , however , it can also be periodic with a certain period , as , for example , in case of fig.[fig : mpex ] ( d ) ( period four ) .",
    "thus , the generating orbit is the key of how to find markov partition values of the slope in a systematic way .    on this basis",
    ", a general algebraic procedure to compute such values of the slope can be developed .",
    "one starts with a further _ topological reduction _ of the whole chain of boxes @xcite . since map @xmath35 is _ old",
    "_ , it is possible to construct the markov partition for the whole chain from a _ reduced map _ @xmath109 via periodic continuation , where @xmath110 $ ] is the fractional part of @xmath15 , @xmath111 $ ] , and @xmath112 $ ] denotes the largest integer less than @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it remains to find markov partitions for map @xmath113 of the equation above .",
    "this can be done in the following way : let @xmath114 be the minimal distance of a maximum of the box map @xmath115 to an integer value . with respect to the markov condition given by definition [ def : mcv ] , it is clear that @xmath116 has to be a partition point . since @xmath113 is point symmetric , @xmath117 also has to be a partition point , and because of map @xmath35 being _ old _ , the fixed point @xmath30 is necessarily another partition point .",
    "thus , the reduced map governs its internal box dynamics according to @xmath118 since @xmath119 and @xmath117 have to be partition points , the markov condition definition [ def : mcv ] can be formalized to @xmath120 i.e. , the generating orbit of a markov partition is defined by the initial condition @xmath116 , its end point @xmath121 and the iteration number @xmath9 . according to eq.([eq : epsdef ] ) , @xmath116 is determined by the slope @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , for map @xmath35 markov partition values of the slope can be computed as solutions of eq.([eq : mcond ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of this equation can be performed numerically as well as , to a certain degree , analytically . to obtain analytical results for markov partition values of the slope ,",
    "one has to determine the structure of the generating orbit in advance , i.e. , one has to know whether it hits the left or the right branch of the box map at the next iteration .",
    "then one can write down an algebraic equation which remains to be solved .",
    "for example , for the markov partition fig .",
    "[ fig : mpex ] ( c ) , the generating orbit is determined by @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 at iteration number @xmath125 .",
    "this leads to @xmath126 for which one may verify @xmath127 as the correct solution .",
    "this way , all markov partition values of the slope are the roots of algebraic equations of @xmath128th order . more examples with analytical solutions are discussed in app .",
    "[ app : dkmp ] . since one usually faces the problem to solve algebraic equations of order greater than 3 , numerical solutions of eq.([eq : mcond ] )",
    "are desirable , although one should take into account that iterations of the reduced map @xmath113 contain many discontinuities , due to the original discontinuity of @xmath113 at @xmath129 as well as due to applying the modulus to @xmath115 in eq.([eq : mod ] ) @xcite .    with respect to the three different end points @xmath121 of the generating orbit in the formal markov condition",
    "eq.([eq : mcond ] ) , three series of markov partitions can be distinguished . for",
    "each series one can increase the iteration number @xmath9 , and one can vary the range of the slope @xmath23 systematically .",
    "these three series have been used as the basis for numerical calculations of the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 , as will be explained below .",
    "however , there exist additional suitable end points @xmath121 for the generating orbit . as an example",
    ", one can choose @xmath121 to be a point on a two - periodic orbit , @xmath130 so that the generating orbit is again eventually periodic , but now being mapped on a periodic orbit which is part of the markov partition instead of being mapped on a simple fixed point .",
    "this way , certain periodic orbits can serve for defining an arbitrary number of new markov partition series with respect to the choice of respective new end points @xmath121 . on the other hand ,",
    "the set of markov partition generating orbits is _ not _ equal to the set of _ all _ periodic orbits .",
    "for example , for the range @xmath131 , eq.([eq:2po ] ) shows that there exists a two - periodic orbit for any slope @xmath23 , but _ not any _ maximum of the map in this range necessarily maps onto this periodic orbit , as is already illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : mpex ] ( a ) and ( b ) , or by other simple solutions of eq.([eq : mcond ] ) , respectively .",
    "this proves that markov partition generating orbits are in fact a subset of all periodic orbits of the map .    with respect to varying the iteration number @xmath9 and the end point @xmath121",
    ", one can expect to get an infinite number of markov partition values of the slope .",
    "in fact , for certain classes of maps the existence of markov partitions can be considered as a natural property of the map @xcite . according to the explanations above",
    ", this does not seem to be true for map @xmath35 . instead , there is numerical evidence for the following conjecture @xcite :    [ conj : mpd ] for map @xmath35 , the markov partition values of the slope a are dense on the real line with @xmath132",
    ".    this denseness conjecture should ensure that it is possible to obtain a representative curve for the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath36 solely by computing diffusion coefficients at markov partition values of the slope .",
    "conjecture [ conj : mpd ] may hold for all other class @xmath32-maps as well . to do such computations",
    ", one needs to construct the corresponding transition matrices to the markov partitions obtained , as it has been shown for the slopes @xmath88 and @xmath58 of map @xmath35 .",
    "this can be done according to the following rule : take as an example any of the box map markov partitions illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpex ] , e.g. , case ( a ) . any dashed rectangle of this partition may be denoted as a _ cell of the partition_. these single cells correspond to the single entries , or matrix elements , of the transition matrix to be obtained .",
    "the transition matrix corresponding to this markov partition can now be constructed by checking where the graph of the map goes across a cell of the partition , by counting the number of these occurrences in each cell and by writing down these values as the matrix elements . for map",
    "@xmath35 , usually these matrix elements will consist of zeroes and ones , but the way they are defined here they can also take other integer values , depending on the choice of the partition , as , e.g. , illustrated in case of @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : erf3 ] ) .    the construction of the box map transition matrix can be simplified by taking the point symmetry of the box map into account .",
    "the transition matrix of the full chain of chainlength @xmath42 again follows by periodic continuation .",
    "these matrices can be denoted as _",
    "topological transition matrices _ , since they reflect purely the topology of the map with respect to the markov partitions , without involving any transition probabilities at this point . in refs.@xcite mathematically rigorous definitions of these transition matrices can be found .",
    "the property of map @xmath35 being _ old _ induces a certain structure in the topological transition matrices .",
    "they are said to be _ banded square block toeplitz matrices _ , i.e. , they consist of certain submatrices , called _ blocks _ , corresponding to the box map markov partitions , and these blocks are the same along diagonals of the topological transition matrix parallel to the main diagonal , forming _ bands _ @xcite .",
    "applying periodic boundary conditions to the chain of boxes defines a subclass of these toeplitz matrices , called _ block circulants _ , where each row is constructed by cycling the previous row forward one block @xcite , see , e.g. , the matrices @xmath64 , eq.([eq : tm4 ] ) , as an example for a simple circulant and @xmath90 , eq.([eq : tm3 ] ) , for a block circulant . according to the transition matrix method outlined in the previous section , it remains to solve the eigenvalue problems of these matrices and to match the respective eigenmodes to the ones of the diffusion equation for computing the corresponding diffusion coefficients @xmath36 . here",
    ", periodic boundary conditions are of great advantage . analytically , as mentioned before and as shown in app .",
    "[ app : dkpbc ] , there exists a general procedure how to solve the eigenvalue problems of simple circulants @xcite , and in some cases it is possible to reduce the eigenvalue problem of a block circulant to that of a simple circulant ( see app .  [",
    "app : dkpbc ] and [ app : dkmp ] ) .",
    "if this method works , it automatically yields `` nice eigenmodes '' , i.e. , eigenvectors of the form of sines and cosines with some fine structure .",
    "these eigenmodes are similar to the eigenmodes of the diffusion equation at this stage ( see app .  [",
    "app : dkmp ] ) , i.e. , before iterating the matrices according to the frobenius - perron matrix equation eq.([eq : fpm ] ) .",
    "the situation is quite different for absorbing boundary conditions , where no such general procedure exists ( see app .",
    "[ app : dkabc ] ) .",
    "if analytical solutions of the eigenvalue problems are not possible anymore , one can obtain numerical solutions .",
    "well - known software packages like nag and imsl provide subroutines to solve the eigenvalue problems of these matrices .",
    "unfortunately , the numerically obtained results for the full spectra turned out not to be very reliable to a certain extent : in comparison to analytical results for periodic boundaries ( see app .",
    "[ app : dkmp ] ) , the nag package does not compute all eigenvectors correctly , i.e. , in the numerical results usually some linear independent eigenvectors are missing .",
    "moreover , both packages provide spectra of eigenvalues which , although partly identical to the analytical solutions , differ in their full range quantitatively to the ones calculated analytically , not taking any degeneracy into account @xcite .",
    "such numerical problems seem to be inherent to the class of non - normal toeplitz matrices , as has already been pointed out by beam and warming @xcite . in fact , solving eigenvalue problems for toeplitz matrices can be considered as a field of active recent research in numerical mathematics @xcite .",
    "however , solely for the purpose of computing diffusion coefficients not the full spectra of the transition matrices are required , but only the few largest eigenvalues and eigenvectors are of interest . with respect to eigenvectors ,",
    "the imsl package has been checked to be reliable in this range , and with respect to eigenvalues , both packages provide exact and identical numerical results , especially for the second largest eigenvalue , which determines the diffusion coefficients . from a practical point of view , the nag package is considerably more efficient in the use of computing time than imsl and more flexible in its subroutines . therefore , for quantitative computations of eigenvalues and diffusion coefficients nag routines have been used , whereas for eigenvector computations imsl procedures have been employed . for computations of diffusion coefficients ,",
    "it is also favorable to consider only the case of periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , solving eigenvalue problems for block circulants , respectively , since it has already been discussed in sect [ txt : tmm ] that absorbing boundaries lead to a poor convergence rate of the diffusion coefficient with the chainlength @xmath42 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : emex ] contains two examples of second largest eigenmodes for chains of boxes with periodic boundaries and non - trivial markov partitions .",
    "again , one gets `` nice '' second largest eigenmodes , i.e. , functions which behave like sines and cosines on a large scale .",
    "however , the structure of these eigenmodes is much more complex on a fine scale , as can be seen in the magnifications of certain regions .",
    "the periodic continuation of the fine structure suggests that it is related to the dynamics of the box map , and therefore varies with changing the slope , whereas the general large - scale behavior of the eigenmodes seems to be a property of the chain of boxes which shows up independently from such microscopic details .",
    "these characteristics have been checked numerically for a variety of other markov partition values of the slope and seem to be a universal feature of map @xmath35 , and probably of all class @xmath33-maps",
    ". one may assume that the fine structure is somehow related to the strength of the diffusion coefficient and that , on the other hand , the universal large - scale structure of the eigenmodes is related to the existence of diffusion coefficients for non - trivial markov partition values of the slope .",
    "in fact , the specific character of the eigenmodes discussed above , which shows up in any analytical solution of ( block ) circulants and which is supported by numerical results , forms the basis for the following conjecture :    [ conj : edk ] let @xmath26 be a class @xmath32-map . if for given value of the slope the map is uniquely ergodic and if there exists a markov partition , then the map is diffusive .    to our knowledge ,",
    "so far no proof has been given in the literature for the existence of diffusion coefficients in class @xmath32-maps for general value of the slope .",
    "however , dealing with a rigorous foundation of the transition matrix method turns out to be intimately connected to proving the existence of diffusion coefficients in this class of dynamical systems . without going into too much detail here ,",
    "some remarks are in order to provide at least a motivation for this conjecture : the existence of markov partitions guarantees that exact transition matrices can be used .",
    "the restriction to class @xmath33-maps ensures that topological transition matrices can be constructed in the simple way outlined before , and the _ old _ property included in the definition of class @xmath32 determines the global structure of the topological transition matrices such that the eigenmodes are `` nice '' , at least for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the requirement to be uniquely ergodic establishes the possibility of diffusion in the chain of boxes and confirms also the uniqueness of the diffusion coefficient to be obtained ( a simple counterexample shows that not any chain of boxes with escape out of one box is automatically diffusive ) .",
    "finally , the term diffusive shall be understood in the sense that a diffusion coefficient exists as defined by the statistical diffusion equation eq.([eq : f2 ] ) , which has been introduced to the dynamical system by successfully performing the matching eigenmodes procedure outlined in the previous section .",
    "therefore , the main proposition of this conjecture is that the matching eigenmodes procedure required by the first passage method works for any value of the slope , if the respective conditions are fulfilled .",
    "a corollary to this conjecture is that in the limit of time @xmath9 and chainlength @xmath42 to infinity , the frobenius - perron equation of the respective class @xmath32-dynamical systems always provides `` nice '' , i.e. , the correct diffusive eigenmodes . as another corollary",
    ", it follows that there is no anomalous diffusion in class @xmath32-maps , i.e. , that normal diffusion is `` typical '' for such piecewise linear maps . a rigorous mathematical proof of conjecture [ conj : edk ] seems to be possible along the lines of first passage and transition matrix method @xcite .",
    "results based on this method shall be presented in the next section .",
    "they have been verified by another numerical method @xcite , by another analytical method which has been implemented numerically @xcite , as well as , to a certain degree , by straightforward computer simulations @xcite . meanwhile , the same results have been obtained by j.  groeneveld with a different method @xcite , and they have also partly been reproduced by cycle expansion techniques @xcite .",
    "based on the methods presented in the previous section , the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath36 has been computed numerically for map @xmath35 for a broad range of values of the slope .",
    "the main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] .",
    "the numerical precision obtained depends on the convergence of the diffusion coefficient with the chainlength , cf .",
    "eq.([eq : dkl ] ) , and is better than @xmath133 for each @xmath36 so that error bars do not appear in the diagrams . it should be emphasized that the numerical method employed here was the first one by which these curves of @xmath36 have been obtained .",
    "it is by far not the most efficient one of the procedures developed up to now to compute deterministic diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out to be very useful as well to compute other deterministic transport coefficients , e.g. , chemical reaction rates @xcite , where more efficient methods fail .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] ( a ) shows the diffusion coefficient of map @xmath35 for values of the slope in the range @xmath134 .",
    "the strength of diffusion clearly increases globally by increasing the slope from @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "this might be expected intuitively , since the probability of a particle to escape out of a box , as well as the mean distance a particle travels by performing a jump , are getting larger by increasing the value of the slope @xcite .",
    "however , the increase of the diffusion coefficient is not monotonic and consists of oscillations not only at integer values of the slope , as has already been mentioned in section [ txt : fpm ] , but also on much finer scales between integer values .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : dkmapl ] ( a ) shows a certain regularity in the appearance of `` wiggles '' , i.e. , local maxima and minima . if one denotes the local maxima at odd integer slopes @xmath23 as wiggles of @xmath137th order and any smaller local maxima systematically as wiggles of higher order , one can find one maximum of first order below @xmath88 , three maxima of first order in the range @xmath138 , five maxima of first order in the range @xmath139 ,  .",
    "this regularity even persists to a certain extent on finer scales , although according to a slightly different rule , as can be seen , e.g. , in the magnification fig .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] ( f ) , @xmath140 , where exactly six wiggles of second order appear between the repsective wiggles of first order . in the same way ,",
    "six wiggles of third order can be observed in this region in further magnifications , and similar structures show up in the region of @xmath141 with four wiggles of second and four wiggles of third order .",
    "the region of @xmath142 is somewhat special and will be discussed separately .",
    "thus , while the number of wiggles of first order increases by a step of two with increasing the slope , the number of wiggles of higher order remains constant in the region between two respective wiggles of first order , even by increasing the order of the wiggles to be considered . on the other hand , magnifications of other regions of the slope show that the structure of the curve is not everywhere that simple .",
    "for example , blow - ups of the regions @xmath143 , fig.[fig : dkmapl ] ( b ) , and @xmath144 , fig .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] ( d ) , do not enable a clear distinction between `` wiggles of different orders '' anymore .",
    "instead , they provide more complex structures which further magnifications , as , e.g. , figs .  [",
    "fig : dkmapl ] ( c ) and ( e ) , reveal to be self - similar .",
    "it can be summarized at this stage that different regions of the curve exhibit different kinds of self - similarity , partly being fairly simple , but partly also being highly non - trivial .",
    "thus , the results of fig .  [ fig : dkmapl ] suggest that the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath36 for map @xmath35 is fractal @xcite . more evidence for the fractality of the curve can be obtained in three different ways : firstly , qualitative and quantitative explanations for the wiggles in certain regions of the slope will be provided , which ensure that these regions exhibit non - trivial self - similar behavior .",
    "this will be demonstrated in the following .",
    "secondly , it is striking to observe that especially diagrams ( c ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) resemble graphs of some fractal functions , which have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite by working on dynamical systems being very similar to the ones considered here .",
    "these functions have been shown to possess fractal dimensions close to one @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , this gives further evidence for the fractality of the curves of fig.[fig : dkmapl ] . on the other hand , this raises the new question whether there is an analytical fractal representation for certain regions of the curve , or maybe even for the full parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient of map @xmath35 .",
    "this problem is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "thirdly , it should be mentioned that numerical computations of the box counting dimension ( or capacity ) @xcite of the curve have been performed .",
    "the results indicate that the curves shown in fig .",

    ". nevertheless , more detailed investigations of the fractal dimension for various regions of the curve could be of much interest .",
    "with respect to the magnifications in fig.[fig : dkmapl ] , it may even be conjectured that the full @xmath36-curve has locally different values of fractal dimensions .",
    "[ fig : plumil ] illustrates the principles of a first qualitative approach to understand the occurrence of wiggles of @xmath137th and @xmath147st order .",
    "it will be called _ plus - minus approach_. the basic idea of this approach is to establish a connection between the appearance of wiggles in the @xmath36-graphs and the occurrence of certain dynamical correlations in the chain of boxes .",
    "these correlations are a main feature of transport of particles from one box to another , and they show up and disappear by varying the slope of the map . in the following , particles will be referred to solely by their positions , i.e. , by points on the real line .",
    "[ fig : plumil ] ( a ) and ( b ) sketch correlations of @xmath137th order : as a starting point , the escape of particles out of one box in one direction , i.e. , to the right , will be considered for varying the slope in the range @xmath148 .",
    "such an escape of points is related to a certain subinterval of the box which will be called _ escape region _ , as is shown in the figure .",
    "if points get mapped to the right at the next iteration , the respective subinterval will be denoted with a plus sign . the same way , subintervals will be denoted with a minus if points get mapped to the left .",
    "therefore , the escape region marked in fig.[fig : plumil ] is part of a plus region , and for small enough slope after only one iteration points of it get mapped directly into another plus region .",
    "this enhances diffusion , since particles can move continuously in one direction , i.e. , here to the right .",
    "the behavior persists for increasing the slope up to @xmath88 . for slopes above this value",
    ", an increasing number of points of the escape region is now mapped into the minus region of the next box .",
    "this way , one obtains a `` plus - minus '' correlation , which means that particles either get slowed down , or even get scattered back into the previous box at the next iteration , which is surely bad for obtaining a strong diffusion coefficient .",
    "this game can be played by gradually increasing the value of the slope and leads to the qualitative `` curve '' in fig.[fig : plumil ] ( b ) , which explains the oscillations at integer slopes and the wiggles of @xmath137th order , respectively . the sequences which mark the extrema in this graph give the symbolic dynamics of orbits close to , but less than @xmath149 after one iteration with respect to the reduced map eq.([eq : mod ] ) , where the region @xmath150 has been labeled with a plus and @xmath151 with a minus .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plumil ] ( c ) the number of iterations has been increased to two .",
    "the method is the same as explained before , however , a further distinction has been made after the first iteration : new subintervals have been defined , which refer to points of the escape region being mapped to another plus or minus region at the second iteration .",
    "one can see that increasing the slope corresponds to creating different plus - minus sequences for orbits close to , but less than @xmath149 .",
    "this leads to the particles being in a good or bad position for going further in one direction with respect to the next iteration , depending on the value of the slope .",
    "the @xmath36-graph in fig.[fig : plumil ] ( d ) again gives the qualitative behavior of @xmath36 to be expected with respect to the dynamical correlations after two iterations , up to @xmath152 .",
    "this result corresponds well to the number of wiggles of first order estimated in the respective regions of the slope .",
    "again , the plus - minus sequences give the symbolic dynamics of points close to , but less than @xmath149 after two iterations .",
    "the plus - minus method works on this level as well for any higher values of the slope and leads to a qualitative explanation of the number of wiggles of first order for any region of the slope . to a certain degree",
    ", it can even explain additional features of the structure of the @xmath36-curves : for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] ( b ) one observes that the local maximum is not precisely at @xmath88 , although this could be expected from the results of the plus - minus method of @xmath137th order .",
    "actually , particles of the escape region close to @xmath149 can still reach a good position for further movement in one direction , even for slopes slightly above @xmath88 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although such points get first scattered back into the previous box after two iterations , here they are now in an excellent position for further jumps to the right again .",
    "this way , these orbits perform a kind of `` spiral '' and seem to be responsible for the surprising fact that the odd integer slope values of @xmath36 are _ not _ precisely identical to the local extrema of the curve , but that there is always a kind of overhang , i.e. , a further increase of the diffusion coefficient right above odd integer slopes , as , e.g. , is shown in detail in fig .  [ fig : dkmapl ] ( c ) .",
    "although the plus - minus method can be applied to achieve a qualitative understanding of the wiggles of @xmath137th and @xmath147st order , further refinements of this method to obtain wiggles of higher order generally turned out not to be very promising .",
    "the main reason is that in case of more iterations of points of the escape region , the dynamics is getting quite complicated and is not easy to handle anymore in the qualitative way illustrated in fig.[fig : plumil ] .",
    "however , the basic idea of this method can be made more quantitative by a procedure which shall be called _",
    "turnstile dynamics_. the principle of turnstile dynamics is again to investigate the appearance and disappearance of long - range dynamical correlations by iterating points with respect to varying the slope .",
    "the new feature is now that not the full intervals of all single boxes are taken into account . instead",
    ", the analysis is restricted solely to the regions of the boxes where transport of particles from one box to another occurs in form of jumps .",
    "these regions are called _ turnstiles _ :    turnstiles are the `` coupling regions '' of the single boxes of a chain of class @xmath32 , where points of one unit interval get mapped outside that particular interval into another unit interval .    this notation has been adapted from the theory of transport of two - dimensional twist maps , such as sawtooth maps , where turnstiles are crucial for understanding large - scale diffusion @xcite .",
    "the escape region introduced above in the context of the plus - minus method represents precisely one half of such a turnstile .",
    "the main idea is to study the _ interaction _ of turnstiles , i.e. , by varying the slope it shall be investigated whether one obtains `` good '' or `` bad '' conditions for particles to get from one turnstile into another , or maybe even to get mapped successively through a series of turnstiles . as before in case of the plus - minus method , such dynamical correlations are expected to show up in the curve for the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath36 .",
    "the advantage of turnstile dynamics is that it can be made quantitative by exemplifying all turnstiles with certain points of these regions .",
    "for instance , the peak of the turnstile one starts with may be represented by the critical point , @xmath149 .",
    "now , one can try to compute the slopes for which this point maps into other turnstiles again , being exemplified by certain points , after certain numbers of iterations .",
    "this has been done in detail for the region @xmath142 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsdmapl ] .",
    "the dashed line in the figure represents the prediciton of @xmath36 for a simple random - walk model as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "note that , on a large scale , the model correctly accounts for the behavior of @xmath36 near @xmath135 , but that with respect to any fine structure , such a simple model is clearly totally apart .",
    "one can see three distinct series of values of @xmath23 in the figure . to understand the nature of these series",
    ", one should consider the orbit of the critical point .",
    "the first iterate of @xmath149 is in the second interval , @xmath153 .",
    "series @xmath154 _ values of @xmath23 are defined by the condition that the second iterate of @xmath149 is at the leftmost point of the upward turnstile in the second interval @xmath153 @xmath155 , or that the third iterate is at the corresponding point in the third interval @xmath156 , etc .",
    "the numbers on the @xmath36-curve refer to the number of intervals the image of @xmath149 has travelled before it gets to the appropriate point on the turnstiles .",
    "_ series @xmath157 _ points are defined in a similar way , but they are allowed to have two or more internal reflections within an interval before reaching the left edge of a turnstile . _ series @xmath158 _ points are defined by the condition that some image of @xmath149 has reached the rightmost edge of an upward turnstile , i.e. , some point @xmath159 , where @xmath71 is an integer .",
    "one observes that each series produces a cascade of apparently self - similar regions of decreasing size , as the limits @xmath160 or @xmath161 are approached .",
    "these cascades provide a basis for a physical understanding of the features of @xmath36 in this region : particles leave a particular unit interval through a turnstile and undergo a number of iterations before they are within another turnstile .",
    "whether they continue to move in the same or in the reverse direction at the next and later turnstiles is a sensitive function of the slope of the map .",
    "thus , the fractal structure of the @xmath36 curve is due to the effects of long - range correlations among turnstiles , and these correlations lead to changes of @xmath36 on an infinitely fine scale .",
    "we note that another way to understand this fractal structure is in terms of so - called `` pruning '' of the microscopic deterministic dynamics .",
    "that is , by varying the parameter @xmath23 certain types of orbits may suddenly disappear .",
    "this means that with respect to a given symbolic dynamics of the map certain symbol sequences , which identify the orbits , do not exist anymore .",
    "this can be related to the irregularities of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "one should note that series @xmath158 points completely label the maxima of higher order introduced before , and series @xmath157 points mark the respective minima .",
    "this way , in the region of the slope @xmath162 the picture of quantitative turnstile dynamics is in full agreement with the results obtained by the qualitative plus - minus method outlined above ( the agreement has been checked to persist at least up to a level of extrema of second order ) .",
    "however , the application of turnstile dynamics has its limits : first , this method is of no use anymore for any higher value of the slope above @xmath88 .",
    "thus , there is no other understanding of the structure in this range than the one provided qualitatively by the plus - minus approach . and second , even for values below @xmath88 turnstile dynamics",
    "is quantitatively not completely correct : apart from the lack of explaining the existence of the overhang above @xmath88 , a detailed analysis reveals further `` tiny overhangs '' at maxima of higher order , as , e.g. , right above the maximum of first order in the region @xmath163 at @xmath164 @xcite . in other words , the `` turnstile values '' marked in fig.[fig : tsdmapl ] by series @xmath158-points represent not the exact local maxima of higher order of the curve .",
    "the true local maxima are in fact shifted slightly to the right from these points , as in case of @xmath88 .",
    "the phenomenon of overhangs are further elucidated in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , apart from the qualitative remarks in the context of the plus - minus approach and the additional insight provided by the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , a detailed explanation of these overhang effects is still missing .    since turnstile",
    "dynamics points seem to separate self - similar regions , it is suggestive to use them as a tool to do some scaling .",
    "series @xmath154-values are especially suitable for this purpose , because they form a series of points which converges monotonically to @xmath88 , defining self - similar regions of decreasing size .",
    "these regions have been scaled according to the size of the intervals of the slope and of the respective diffusion coefficient intervals defined by @xmath165 ( note that @xmath135 has been taken here as series @xmath154 point @xmath137 ) . to obtain scaling factors , the fractions @xmath166 have been computed .",
    "they led to the two series of values given in table [ tab : scal ] .",
    "@xmath167 seems to converge quite rapidly to a value around @xmath168 , whereas @xmath169 approaches not that fast a value apparently between @xmath170 and @xmath168 , but this is no more than a guess based on the first five values of two infinite series , since the data set of slopes and @xmath36-values is not sufficient for obtaining better results .",
    "at least these values suggest that some quantitative scaling is possible in this region .    at this point",
    ", it should be stressed that the region below @xmath88 is special , compared to any other region of the slope : firstly , the structure of the curve is remarkably simple , as shown in fig.[fig : tsdmapl ] .",
    "secondly , the number of wiggles of higher order is not constant with increasing order , but grows according to the structure described by the turnstile dynamics performed above .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of @xmath36 in the ranges @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where one may have expected similar generalities .",
    "thirdly , the region below @xmath88 is the only one which is simple enough such that turnstile dynamics can successfully be applied at all , and this region seems to provide some simple scaling laws .",
    "all this nice behavior suddenly breaks down at the value @xmath88 , which is marked by the largest overhang of the whole curve .",
    "therefore , it might be assumed that the point at @xmath88 separates regions of fundamental different dynamical behavior of the map , i.e. , the dynamics seems to be sufficiently simple below , but suddenly gets quite complicated above this value .",
    "in fact , there is further evidence that such a transition exists , as is discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "finally , another interesting feature of the parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient for map @xmath35 shall be pointed out . to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : ddmapl ] , the first `` derivative '' of the @xmath36-curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : dkmapl ] has been computed with respect to the full data set of @xmath36-values available .",
    "this has been done in linear approximation , i.e. , two adjacent points of the data set have been connected with straight lines , and the `` derivative '' @xmath173 for @xmath174 has been computed . however , since the curve of @xmath36 is expected to be nowhere differentiable with respect to the slope , the derivative defined above should be better denoted as a `` pseudo - derivative '' , i.e. , as a kind of mean value of @xmath175 over tiny regions of @xmath176 which are approaching zero .",
    "thus , the pseudo - derivative presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddmapl ] is mathematically not well - defined .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results turn out to be quite reasonable in the sense that they reflect to a certain degree the fractal structure of the actual @xmath36-curve .",
    "for instance , the three `` bands '' right above @xmath135 seem to be due to the `` triangle - like '' self - similar structure of the region presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddmapl ] , and the `` bursts '' at odd integer values correspond to the occurrence of local maxima and to the deformations of simple self - similar structures .",
    "we remark that in fig.[fig : ddmapl ] the number of slopes for which @xmath36-values have been calculated is not homogeneously distributed over the whole range @xmath177 , but that the number of points per interval is greater in certain regions of the slope , as , e.g. , right above @xmath135 , @xmath88 and around @xmath178 .",
    "these regions thus show up as slightly pronounced parts in the derivative plot , however , the structure of the curve does not seem to be affected by it . more details of this curve are discussed in refs .  @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , we have shown that the diffusion coefficient of such a map changes in a fractal way by varying a control parameter .",
    "starting from this fundamental result , there are at least two directions in which our research can be pursued : one way is to study whether other transport quantities , like electric conductivities , chemical reaction rates , or magnetoresistancies can exhibit such an irregular behavior as well .",
    "another way is to investigate whether fractal transport coefficients exist in more complicated , and thus more realistic , dynamical systems .",

    "deterministic diffusion coefficients and deterministic currents which change irregularly by varying respective parameters have also been found in parameter - dependent two - dimensional multibaker models @xcite . in their transport properties , these models are closely related to the class of one - dimensional maps discussed here . however , in addition they provide more physical features like being time - reversible @xcite and being area - preserving or dissipative in a well - defined sense .",
    "negative currents have been observed in these systems as well , and a parameter - dependent diffusive - reactive multibaker yields chemical reaction rates which are also fractal in a parameter @xcite .    in the periodic lorentz gas ,",
    "however , there is up to now no clear indication about a fractal behavior of transport coefficients .",

    "could even be confirmed by calculations based on cycle expansions @xcite .    whether deterministic phenomena of this kind play a role in real statistical , experimentally accessible systems is a very open question . following the chaotic hypothesis of gallavotti and cohen @xcite",
    ", one may believe that these phenomena are rather due to the simplicity of the models and should eventually disappear if the systems are getting more complex .",
    "respectively , we would expect that certain necessary conditions must be fulfilled for systems to exhibit characteristics of fractal transport coefficients which may contradict the spirit of the chaotic hypothesis , such as being spatially periodic , low - dimensional , and such that particle - particle interactions are not of main importance .",
    "physical systems of this kind could - to a certain extent - already be realized experimentally in form of so - called antidot lattices . here ,",
    "magnetoresistancies which fluctuate irregularly by varying the field strength have already been observed experimentally in a classical limit @xcite , and to a certain extent they have been explained theoretically by identifying special orbits in the microscopic dynamics @xcite .",
    "another candidate of a system where certain irregularities in transport could be of a deterministic origin are so - called ratchets , where negative currents have already been found experimentally , as well as in theoretical models ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and further references therein ) .",
    "in fact , it can be argued that there exists a relation between certain types of ratchets and the class of one - dimensional maps ( supplemented by a bias ) studied here @xcite .",
    "fractal transport coefficients in one - dimensional maps actually appear to be stable with respect to imposing different kinds of random perturbations on the system @xcite .",
    "this means that the fractal structure gradually smoothes out by increasing the perturbation strength and thus survives in form of irregular oscillations on finer scales if the perturbation is small enough .",
