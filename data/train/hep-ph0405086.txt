    "in this paper the masses and decay processes of several new strange , charmed or bottomed exotic pentaquarks are predicted in the linear - molecule heptaquark approach .",
    "exotic multiquarks are expected since the early works of jaffe @xcite , and the masses and decays in the su(3 ) exotic anti - decuplet were first predicted within the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "the pentaquarks have been revived by several searches of the @xmath0(1540 ) @xcite , first discovered at leps @xcite , and by recent searches of the @xmath1(1860 ) and of the @xmath2(3100 ) , respectively at na49 @xcite and at h1 @xcite .",
    "presently the number of negative experiments is larger than the number of positive experiments .",
    "for example the recent clas higher statistics analysis contradicts previous clas and elsa experiments .",
    "nevertheless the positive experiments do nt allow us to exclude the pentaquarks , but they show that the pentaquarks can only be produced in certain processes .",
    "in particular , recent new experiments , by svd-2 and leps @xcite continue to confirm the @xmath0 pentaquark .",
    "a new @xmath3 pentaquark was also discovered recently at star @xcite , which suggests that the pentaquark may have isospin 1 or 2 @xcite .",
    "if this is confirmed , the theoretical pentaquark models predicting isospin 0 for the @xmath4 would be ruled out .",
    "experimental upgrades are already programmed to further scan the pentaquarks .",
    "pentaquark structures have also been studied in the lattice @xcite . in the range of the @xmath0 experimental mass , quenched lattice simulations only identify a parity - system , compatible with an open kaon - nucleon channel .",
    "pentaquarks motivate this effort , because they may be the first exotic hadrons ever discovered , with quantum numbers that can not be interpreted as a quark - plus - antiquark meson or as a three - quark baryon .",
    "importantly , the observed pentaquarks have an extremely narrow decay width , two orders of magnitude smaller than normal hadronic decay widths .",
    "it is also remarkable that many different models presently dispute the interpretation of these multiquarks .",
    "it is well known that the pentaquark can not be a simple five quark state in the groundstate , because it would freely recombine and decay in a kaon and a nucleon , resulting in resonance with a very broad decay width .",
    "thus all plausible models essentially propose an excitation which limits the decay width of the pentaquark . because the models of non - pertubative hadronic physics are not yet sufficiently accurate or properly calibrated to describe with an excellent precision five - particle ( or more ) states , there is still room for different theoretical models .",
    "examples of different models are the chiral soliton model of diakonov , petrov and polyakov with a rotational excitation in the pseudoscalar field @xcite , the anti - triplet diquark model of jaffe and wilczek , karliner and lipkin with a p - wave excitation @xcite , and the heptaquark model of pb and marques , applied in this paper , of llanes - estrada , oset and mateu , and of kishimoto and sato @xcite , or tri - linear - molecular model , with a quark - antiquark excitation .",
    "more experimental data on the pentaquarks are necessary to test the different models .",
    "moreover the observation of the @xmath2(3100 ) at h1 @xcite and the observation of double - charmed baryons at selex @xcite , and the expected search of double - charmed baryons at compass @xcite suggest that many new pentaquarks with one or two heavy quarks may still be discovered .",
    "multiquarks are indeed favoured by the presence of several different flavours @xcite . in this paper",
    "i perform a systematic exploration of pentaquarks with any possible combination of flavours . for different searches , see references @xcite .    here",
    ", multiquarks are studied microscopically in a standard quark - model ( qm ) hamiltonian .",
    "any multiquark state can be formally decomposed in combinations of simpler colour - singlet clusters , the baryons and mesons .",
    "the energy of the multiquark state is computed with the multiquark matrix element of the qm hamiltonian .",
    "these matrix elements also produce the short range interaction of the mesonic or baryonic subclusters of the multiquark .",
    "however , in the case of any pure exotic groundstate pentaquark , the short - range interaction can be shown to be repulsive @xcite .",
    "this repulsion agrees with the quenched lattice simulations , which in the range of the @xmath0 experimental mass , only identify a parity - system , compatible with an open kaon - nucleon channel .    to search for attraction",
    ", one should also study other cluster - cluster interactions .",
    "for instance in the @xmath5 system , the attractive long - range one - pion - exchange - potential and the medium - range sigma - exchange potential are crucial for the binding of the deuteron . in a microscopic quark",
    "hamiltonian perspective these interactions are equivalent to the coupling to a channel with an extra pion ( @xmath6 quark - antiquark cluster ) plus a p - wave excitation , and to a second channel with two extra s - wave pions respectively . because the long range interaction is vanishing or small , and the medium range interaction may be insufficient to provide all the desired attraction , the five - quark systems are too unstable to produce narrow pentaquarks .",
    "nevertheless , one may consider that an s - wave flavour - singlet light quark - antiquark pair @xmath7 is added to the pentaquark @xmath8 .",
    "when the resulting heptaquark @xmath9 remains bound , it is a state with parity opposite to the original @xmath8 @xcite , where the reversed parity occurs due to the intrinsic parity of fermions and anti - fermions .",
    "the ground - state of @xmath9 is also naturally rearranged in an s - wave baryon and in two s - wave mesons , where the two outer hadrons are repelled , while the central hadron provides stability .",
    "the mass of the heptaquark @xmath9 is expected to be slightly lower than the exact sum of these standard hadron masses due to the binding energy .",
    "because the s - wave pion is the lightest hadron , the minimum energy needed to create a quark - antiquark pair can be as small as 100 - 200 mev .",
    "this energy shift is lower than the typical energy of 300 - 600 mev of spin - isospin or angular excitations in hadrons .",
    "therefore , the first excitation of multiquarks is quark - antiquark creation .",
    "moreover , the heptaquarks @xmath9 may only decay into a low - energy p - wave channel ( after the extra quark - antiquark pair is annihilated ) , resulting in a very narrow decay width , consistent with the observed exotic flavour pentaquarks .",
    "the @xmath9 is then a linear molecular system , light and with a narrow width .    in very recent works",
    "this principle was used to indicate that the @xmath0(1540 ) is probably a @xmath10 molecule with binding energy of 30 mev @xcite , and the @xmath1(1862 ) is a @xmath11 molecule with a binding energy of 60 mev @xcite .",
    "i also suggest that the new positive parity scalar @xmath12 and axial @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 multiquarks @xcite , in agreement with the independent models of barnes , close and lipkin and of terasaki @xcite , and that the @xmath16(3100 ) is consistent with a @xmath17 linear molecule with an energy of 15 mev above threshold @xcite . assuming this description of the presently observed pentaquarks , i now predict all possible exotic strange , charmed and bottomed pentaquarks compatible with the linear - molecule model .    in section",
    "[ sec : cri ] the exotic baryon - meson short - range s - wave interaction is studied .",

    "moreover , the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite was applied by ribeiro , by oka and yasaki , and by toki @xcite to show that in exotic @xmath22 scattering the quark two - body - potential , together with the pauli repulsion of quarks , explains the @xmath22 hard core repulsion .",
    "recently , addressing a tetraquark system with @xmath23 quantum numbers , it was shown that the qm with the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath24 also fully complies with chiral symmetry , including the adler zero and the weinberg theorem @xcite .",

    "[ rgm overlaps ] is identical to the matrix element of the hyperfine potential times an algebraic number and a factor with the dimension of the square of the wave - function .",

    "( [ sum rules ] ) that the annihilation potential provides an attractive ( negative ) interaction .",

    "( [ hyperfine ] ) and the quark exchange of eq .",

    "this results in a repulsive interaction .",
    "the short - range interactions are independent of the details of the chiral - invariant quark model that one chooses to consider .",
    "therefore , i arrive at the attraction / repulsion criterion for groundstate hadrons : + - _ whenever the two interacting hadrons have quarks ( or antiquarks ) with a common flavour , the repulsion is increased by the pauli principle ; + - when the two interacting hadrons have a quark and an antiquark with the same flavour , the attraction is enhanced by the quark - antiquark annihilation_.    for instance , @xmath87 is attractive , and @xmath88 is repulsive . in the cases where attraction is added to repulsion , it turns out that attraction prevails when there are more quark - antiquark matchings than quark - quark ones .",
