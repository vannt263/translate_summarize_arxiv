    "the tauvex ( tel - aviv university ultra - violet experiment ) is a collaborative uv imaging experiment between indian institute of astrophysics ( iia , bangalore , india ) and tel - aviv university , israel .",
    "tauvex will have three uv imaging telescopes of 20-cm area which will obtain uv images of the sky in the spectral region of 1250   to 3220   with 5 different band filters .",
    "each telescope has a field of view ( fov ) of about 54 and a spatial resolution of about 6 - 10 \" , depending on the wavelength .",
    "it will be placed into a geostationary orbit as part of indian space research organization s ( isro s ) gsat-4 mission .    in its life time",
    "the satellite is expected to collect data of about @xmath0 celestial sources ( brosch 1998 ) of both point sources ( stars , qso s etc ) as well as extended sources like nebulae , galaxies , clusters etc .",
    "with such a huge data set there is a call for automatizing the segregation of the point sources from other non - point - like sources .",
    "different machine learning algorithms governed by some learning rule serves this purpose and they are now routinely used in astronomy for different classification problems .",
    "there are three major learning paradigms for machine learning algorithms : supervised learning , unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning , each corresponding to a particular learning task .",
    "some examples of such machine learning algorithms are artificial neural network ( ann ) , support vector machines , difference boosting neural network , self - organized maps ( som ) etc .",
    "odewahn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) pioneered the use of ann based scheme for automated segregation of stars and galaxies based on point - spread function ( psf ) fitting .",
    "mhnen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) used som based neural network using the ccd images directly .",
    "mhnen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also introduced another method based on fuzzy set reasoning .",
    "philip et al . ( 2002 ) used the difference boosting neural network for the star - galaxy classification of noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ) .",
    "qin et al . ( 2003 ) also demonstrated the use of spectra for the same purpose using rbf neural network , in the wavelength range of 3800 - 7420  . in this paper , we propose the use of ann with integrated flux measurements in different bands , in case of non - availability of full spectra , to separate objects ( stars and galaxies ) with different spectral energy distributions .",
    "the wavelength of concern in the present work is the uv range ( 1250 - 3200 ) .",
    "we also classify the two types of objects using corresponding full spectral informations and present a comparison between the two schemes ( i.e , using band data and full spectral data ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that the integrated flux approach has already been used to classify stellar objects into different spectral types and to estimate the colour excess for the hot stars ( bora et al .",
    "however , while doing the classification in the above mentioned work , it was assumed that the separation of the stellar objects from other celestial objects have been done apriori by some other method .",
    "thus with the incorporation of the proposed scheme both the tasks of star - galaxy segregation and star classification can be performed with the band integrated flux to be available from the tauvex satellite .",
    "in this section , we very briefly review the basics of ann and describe the network structure used in the present work .",
    "the neural network considered here is the supervised learning network , with a back - propagation algorithm ( gulati et al .",
    "1994 , 1997a , b ; singh et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the network consists of three layers , i.e. ( i ) input layer , ( ii ) hidden layer and ( iii ) output layer .",
    "patterns are presented to the network for learning at the input layers which are subsequently communicated to the hidden layer .",
    "the hidden layer interconnects the input and the output layers and can have several nodes with a particular transfer function .",
    "the actual processing is done in the hidden layer via weighted connections and the outputs are rendered at the output layers ( bailer - jones , gupta & singh 2002 ) , we have used two hidden layers of 64 nodes each with a sigmoid function as the transfer function .",
    "the scheme requires a training session where the ann output and the desired output get compared after each iteration and the connection weights get updated till the desired minimum error threshold is reached . at this stage , the network training is complete and the connection weights are considered frozen . the next stage is the testing session in which the test patterns are fed to the network and output is the classification of the objects as star or galaxy .",
    "in the following , we describe the data sources for the stellar and galaxy spectra , and the generation of the train and test test sets for the network .      _",
    "( i ) the stellar data set : _ we have used the uvblue fluxes ( rodriguez - merino et al . 2005 ) for generating the training sets for stellar spectra with solar type stars with @xmath1$]=@xmath2 ( http://www.bo.astro.it/@xmath3eps/uvblue/uvblue.html ) .",
    "the references ( allen ( 2000 ) , erika bohm - vitense ( 1981 ) , johnson ( 1966 ) , ridgway et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , alonso , arribas & martinez - roger ( 1999 ) and bertone et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) provide the necessary information for matching the parameter space of uvblue to spectral - types .",
    "the uvblue library source provides the sets of theoretical fluxes ( based on kurucz model atmospheres ) in the uv region .",
    "the test spectra were taken from the iue low resolution spectra : reference atlas , normal stars , esa sp-1052 by heck et al .",
    "( 1984 ) which contains 229 low - dispersion flux calibrated spectra of o to k spectral type at a resolution of 6   obtained by the iue satellite .    _",
    "( ii ) the galaxy data set : _ for galaxy spectra we have used the uv - optical spectra of 99 nearby quiescent and active galaxies available online on http://www.stsci .",
    "edu / ftp / catalogs / nearby_gal / sed.html ( storchi - bergmann et al . ) .",
    "the spectra covers the wavelength range 1200 - 3200    with a resolution of 5 - 8  .",
    "although an extended grid of synthetic galaxy spectra are available in the wavelength range 2500 to 10500    with zero - redshift ( fioc et al .",
    "1997 ) , there is no such grid in the range of our interest ( 1200 - 3200  ) .",
    "so , we choose a subset of the galaxies from the above mentioned database as the train set , keeping the rest for the test set .",
    "the selection of the galaxy subset for the training session is based on the following general observations related to the galaxy spectra :    the spectra of galaxies of different morphological types reveal that the elliptical and the s0 galaxies essentially have no star - formation activity and the spectra of these two types look quite similar . by contrast , the sc spirals and the irr galaxies have a spectrum dominated by emission lines . on the other hand the sa and the sb galaxies form a kind of transition between these early - type galaxies and sc galaxies ( schneider 2006 ) .",
    "depending on these spectral distributions we prepare a list of 16 galaxies spanning over all the above mentioned types as the training sample .",
    "the remaining 69 galaxies are then used as the test set .",
    "all these galaxies considered in the train set and in the test are at the low red - shift regions .",
    "it is to be mentioned that the tauvex detectors being virtually noiseless and also with little or no stray light in parts of the orbit , its detection will be limited only by photon statistics ( brosch 1998 ; safonova et al .",
    "1998 ) and so the effect of noise on the data is not taken into account .          while making the train and the test sets",
    ", one has to ensure that the number of spectral fluxes at the respective wavelengths and the starting , ending wavelengths are identical .",
    "also the spectral resolution of the two sets needs to be the same .",
    "this has been achieved by first trimming the spectra in the range of 1250 - 3200   at 40 data bins and then convolving the iue star / galaxy spectra with appropriate gaussian functions to bring down their resolution to 50 .",
    "the resolution of uvblue spectral types have also been degraded to a resolution of 50   using the relevant codes provided on the uvblue library web site ( http://www.bo.astro.it/  eps / uvblue / go.html ) .",
    "the details of the procedure adopted for generating the band integrated train and test sets is described below with reference to the tauvex filter response . for the tauvex mission",
    ", the observations will be available from 1250   to 3220   spectral region using filters , namely bbf , sf1 , sf2 , sf3 and nbf3 , in five uv bands .",
    "fig.@xmath4 shows the total response of each of the tauvex filters in units of effective area @xmath5 and their approximate characteristics are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".tauvex filters specifications [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab1 ]",
    "this work is supported by a research grant from indian space research organization under its respond scheme .",
