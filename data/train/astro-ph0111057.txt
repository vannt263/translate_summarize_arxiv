    "globular clusters are thought to contain objects with a very wide range of masses , although even the present - day mass function is rather poorly constrained by observations ( see , e.g. , bedin et al .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is even less constrained , as it depends also on the details of the overall cluster dynamical evolution ( vesperini & heggie 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , even for highly idealized systems of unevolving point masses , a wide mass spectrum , combined with the effects of two - body relaxation , leads to a variety of complex dynamical phenomena that are still poorly understood theoretically ( heggie et al .",
    "we will refer to these phenomena collectively here as `` mass segregation , '' but note that they involve a number of different processes such as as mass loss through the tidal boundary , energy equipartition and mass stratification , gravothermal contraction , and even , in some cases , gravothermal instabilities ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "the masses of directly observable stars today in globular clusters cover a relatively narrow range from @xmath9 ( e.g. , primordial binaries , blue stragglers , neutron stars ; see , e.g. , bailyn 1995 ) down to @xmath10 at the faint end of the main sequence ( e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "much more massive stars were certainly present earlier in the dynamical evolution of these clusters , including more massive main - sequence stars and binaries , as well as primordial @xmath11 black holes ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) . much lower mass objects such as brown dwarfs or planets may also have formed in large numbers within the cluster initially and , as we will show in this paper , significant numbers could also have been retained to the present",
    ".    some lower mass objects @xmath12 have been detected in globular clusters as companions to millisecond radio pulsars ( damico et al .  2001 ;",
    "ford et al .",
    "2000 ; freire et al.2001 ) .",
    "gilliland et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used _ hst _ to search for transits by giant planets in short - period orbits ( `` hot jupiters '' ) around main - sequence stars in the central region of 47  tuc .",
    "they reported a negative result and concluded that the planet frequency in 47  tuc must be at least an order of magnitude below that for the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , in the high - density central region of this cluster , where the search was conducted , planetary systems are likely to be disrupted by encounters with other stars and binaries ( davies & sigurdsson 2001 ) , and the frequency of `` free - floating '' planets is not constrained by these observations .",
    "in contrast , gravitational microlensing can be used to try to detect such `` free - floating '' planets ( paczyski 1994 ) .",
    "analysis of microlensing events toward the galactic bulge suggests the presence of a substantial amount of lower mass objects in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "more recently , in a pioneering study , sahu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) monitored about 83,000 galactic bulge stars for microlensing by objects in the globular cluster m22 .",
    "they reported one clear microlensing event associated with an object of about @xmath13 , and six events unresolved in time that were very tentatively associated with planetary - mass objects in the cluster    observational evidence for mass segregation has been found in a number of globular clusters . in some cases , direct evidence comes from the measurement of a more centrally concentrated density profile for some heavier stellar population , such as blue stragglers or radio pulsars ( ct , richer & fahlman 1991 ; layden et al .  1999",
    "; rasio 2000 ) . more often , the evidence comes from an apparent decrease in the slope of the ( continuous ) mass function toward the cluster core .",
    "this can either be estimated from the observed luminosity function at different radii ( howell et al .",
    "2001 ; sosin 1997 ) or inferred from color gradients ( howell , guhathakurta , & tan 2000 ) .",
    "note that , in contrast to younger star clusters where the present - day mass segregation may still reflect initial conditions ( figer et al .",
    "1999 ; but see portegies zwart et al .  2002 ) , any mass segregation observed in the central regions of globular clusters must be a result of dynamical evolution , since the relaxation time in those regions is typically much shorter than globular cluster ages ( by a factor @xmath14 ) .",
    "our theoretical understanding of the dynamical evolution of dense star clusters containing a wide mass spectrum is far from complete , even in the highly idealized limit of unevolving point masses .",
    "direct @xmath0-body simulations are very computationally intensive and have therefore been limited to systems with unrealistically low @xmath15 and rather narrow mass spectra ( de la fuente marcos 1996 ; giersz & heggie 1997 ; takahashi & portegies zwart 2000 ) .",
    "since realistic imfs are thought to increase ( perhaps steeply ) toward smaller masses , a lower - mass cut - off ( usually @xmath16 ) is introduced to avoid ending up with very few heavier objects and a large numerical noise in the simulation ( since these heavier objects often dominate the overall dynamics ) .    instead , in this paper , we use hnon s _ monte carlo _ method to compute the dynamical evolution of clusters containing a more realistic number of stars ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "our monte carlo code , as well as a number of test calculations and comparisons with direct @xmath0-body integrations , have been described in detail in joshi , rasio , & portegies zwart ( 2000 ) and joshi , nave , & rasio ( 2001 ) . as a first step , we consider in this paper the simplest _ two - component clusters _ , in which only two types of objects , of mass @xmath1 and @xmath17 , are present .",
    "in addition , we assume that most objects in the cluster are of mass @xmath1 , while the objects of mass @xmath2 form a _ tracer population _ , i.e. , the total component mass ratio @xmath18 . in general , the gravothermal evolution of a two - component cluster can be either stable or unstable , depending on the two ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( spitzer 1969 ) .",
    "in the stable case , the two components remain thermally coupled and the cluster evolves dynamically toward energy equipartition between the two species . in the unstable case , energy equipartition is impossible and the heavier species decouples thermally from the rest of the cluster , evolving separately toward core collapse and interacting with the lighter component through the mean gravitational field only . in a previous paper ( watters , joshi , &",
    "rasio 2000 ) we studied systematically the development of this instability ( sometimes called the spitzer `` mass - stratification '' instability ) in two - component systems , and we determined the location of the stability boundary in the parameter space of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "instead , in this paper , complementary to our previous study , we concentrate on the stable systems with @xmath21 and we study systematically the effects of their dynamical evolution toward energy equipartition .",
    "in particular , we seek to characterize quantitatively the tendency for heavier objects to develop radial density profiles that are more centrally concentrated , as well as the tendency for lighter objects to concentrate away from the central regions , and to be preferentially evaporated in the galactic tidal field .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we present an overview of our numerical approach , and we describe our initial conditions . in sec .",
    "3 we present our results for light tracers ( with @xmath22 ) and we discuss their implications for microlensing by low - mass objects in globular clusters . in sec .  4 we present our results for heavy tracers ( with @xmath23 ) and we compare them to simple analytical estimates . our conclusions and summary",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "we study exclusively two - component clusters comprised of point masses , ignoring the effects of binaries and stellar evolution . to evolve the clusters",
    ", we use our recently developed 2-d monte carlo code @xcite , which is based on hnon s monte carlo algorithm for solving the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "our code has shown close agreement with direct and fokker - planck calculations of one - component clusters @xcite , as well as calculations incorporating mass spectra and tidal mass loss @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated reasonable agreement with the results of many different codes from heggie s `` collaborative experiment '' ( @xcite ; see especially fig .  2 of @xcite ) .    for the initial conditions",
    ", we use the king model ( a lowered maxwellian ) , given by the distribution function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ( negative ) energy of each star relative to the potential at the tidal radius @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the relative gravitational potential , and @xmath28 is a normalization constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is a parameter , and should not be confused with the actual velocity dispersion @xmath30 .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , or @xcite . for light tracers",
    "we enforce the tidal boundary induced by the galaxy using a simple spherical roche approximation ( joshi et al .",
    "2001 ) , while for heavy tracers ( which tend to concentrate near the cluster center and hardly ever get ejected ) we treat the clusters as isolated .    to effect a two - component distribution , we first create a single - component distribution of stars of mass @xmath1 according to equation ( [ one ] ) , and then randomly replace a fraction of these background stars with tracers of mass @xmath2 , so that the initial density profile of the tracers is the same as that of the background .",
    "although this creates clusters that are initially slightly out of virial equilibrium , we find that they settle into virial equilibrium within a few crossing times ( a few timesteps ) .",
    "we have verified this independently using direct integrations ( see below ) , which relax to virial equilibrium within a few crossing times .    for light tracers ( with mass ratio @xmath3 ) , we consider a variety of king models for the initial conditions , with dimensionless central potentials @xmath31 , a variety of mass ratios in the range @xmath32 , and a tracer population of either @xmath33 or @xmath34 out of @xmath35 total stars .",
    "table 1 gives the initial conditions for each model . in all cases ,",
    "tracers make up no more than 0.5% of the mass of each cluster , and consequently do not significantly affect the overall evolution of the cluster .    for heavy tracers ,",
    "we consider king models with @xmath36 , a variety of mass ratios in the range @xmath37 , and a tracer population in the range @xmath38 . with a mass ratio greater than one , it is not always feasible to use such a small number of tracers that the cluster is less than a few percent tracers by mass , since then statistical noise is too great .",
    "instead , we choose a reasonable value for the number of tracers , and consequently explore both systems which can reach energy equipartition , and systems which evolve away from thermal equilibrium . a simple test to determine whether thermal equilibrium is possible for a two - component cluster",
    "is the spitzer stability condition @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the total masses of species 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath42 is less than about @xmath43 , the system is `` spitzer - stable , '' and the two components will reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath42 exceeds this value , the system is said to be `` spitzer - unstable , '' and equipartition is impossible .",
    "@xcite performed a more refined analysis using our dynamical monte carlo code to evolve a wide range of two - component clusters , and arrived at the more accurate empirical stability criterion @xmath44 table 2 gives these stability parameters , as well as the initial conditions , for each model considered .",
    "some calculations with @xmath45 were repeated with direct integrations . for these direct calculations",
    ", we used the program kira within the starlab software environment ( see @xcite and http://manybody.org ) and used the special - purpose grape-4 and grape-6 hardware ( a single grape-6 board ) @xcite to accelerate the computation of gravitational forces between stars .",
    "time integration of stellar orbits was accomplished using a fourth - order hermite scheme @xcite .",
    "kira also incorporates block timesteps @xcite and a special treatment of close two - body and multiple encounters of arbitrary complexity .",
    "given the high cost of the direct integrations we limited our selection of initial conditions to a few models with @xmath45 and performed the calculations with @xmath46 stars ; these calculations take of order 10 days each to complete on either the grape-4 or a single grape-6 board .",
    "( with our monte - carlo code , each calculation takes @xmath47 hours . )",
    "following the convention of most previous studies , we define dynamical units so that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the initial total mass and total energy of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the units of length , @xmath51 , and time , @xmath52 , are then @xmath53 application of the virial theorem shows that @xmath51 is the virial radius of the cluster and @xmath52 is of the order of the initial dynamical ( crossing ) time . in the code , we use as the unit of time the initial relaxation time , @xmath54 , which is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the initial total number of stars in the cluster . for a two - component cluster ,",
    "it is possible to define similar relaxation times for each component separately .",
    "the relaxation time for component 1 , @xmath57 , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial number of stars of component 1 , and @xmath60 is the crossing time for component 1 , given by equation ( [ time1 ] ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 replaced by the initial total mass and energy of component 1 , respectively . the relaxation time for component 2 , @xmath61 , is given analogously , although the resulting expression is only applicable when the two species have decoupled ( e.g. , a collection of black holes undergoing the spitzer mass - stratification instability ) .    to facilitate comparison with previous studies ,",
    "we report times in this paper in units of the initial half - mass relaxation time , @xmath62 , given by the standard expression ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1987 ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the initial half - mass radius , and @xmath65 is the average stellar mass .",
    "each calculation is terminated when the @xmath66 lagrangian radius of the heavier component falls below 0.001 ( in our length units ) .",
    "the lagrangian radii are then inspected graphically and the core collapse time , @xmath67 , determined by noting the time at which the innermost lagrangian radii of the heavier component begin to dip appreciably .",
    "core collapse times determined in this way are not sensitive to the precise criterion used but can have a large statistical uncertainty , particularly when the number of stars within the innermost lagrangian radii is small .",
    "intuition has it that globular clusters can not contain extremely light stars , since equipartition of energy would imply a mean velocity for the light stars that far exceeds the escape velocity for the cluster @xcite . although proportionately more light tracers than background stars are lost during the evolution , we find that a significant fraction are retained in the halo . in some cases",
    "their number density there actually increases during the evolution .      to ensure the validity of our monte carlo results",
    ", we first sought to compare integrations performed with the monte carlo code with the results of direct simulations .",
    "as a representative case , figure [ fig1 ] shows 5 , 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 , and 90% lagrange radii ( radii containing a constant mass fraction ) for background stars ( left ) and tracers ( right ) for a @xmath68 king initial model with mass ratio @xmath69 .",
    "the agreement remains quite good at all times .",
    "the two methods agree remarkably in the most relevant result : that the light tracer stars `` diffuse '' into the outer halo , while the core , comprised mainly of heavier `` background '' stars , contracts .",
    "this is consistent with the mass segregation found with previous and fokker - planck studies @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig2a ] displays the segregation more clearly , showing _ only _ the monte carlo results from figure [ fig1 ] . here",
    "background stars are represented by a solid line , light tracers by a dotted line .",
    "as one expects from simple energy equipartition arguments , the tracers gain energy from interactions and are pushed out of the core , as is seen in the mass segregation evident as early as @xmath70 .",
    "however , 25% of the tracer population is left to linger in the outer regions at the time of core collapse .",
    "( by contrast , 65% of the background stars remain in the cluster . ) instead of receiving large monolithic kicks from the heavy stars and being immediately ejected from the cluster , the light tracers slowly gain energy and are gradually pushed out into the halo , where there are so few heavy stars that the light tracers are unable to exchange energy and are left there to linger .",
    "figure [ fig2b ] is the same as figure [ fig2a ] , but for a very centrally concentrated @xmath71 king initial model . because this cluster is initially so close to core collapse",
    ", it does not have much time to evolve ; yet by collapse over 90% of the tracers occupy the outer region of the cluster in which 75% of the background stars reside .",
    "this extreme segregation is witnessed even for a more moderate mass ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig2c ] shows the same as figure [ fig2a ] , but for a @xmath73 , @xmath72 model . here , by the time of core collapse ,",
    "about 90% of the tracers occupy the outer region in which 50% of the tracers reside .    for a more detailed look at the radial profile of the light tracers relative to the background ,",
    "figure [ fig3a ] shows the number of stars in each radial bin .",
    "the number in each bin is divided by the _ initial _",
    "total number of stars in the cluster , @xmath56 , so that the vertical axis represents the fraction of stars in each bin .",
    "this histogram , which is proportional to @xmath74 , is _ not _ a number density plot but still gives a feel for the number density , and was chosen because it most clearly displays phenomena at large radius .",
    "shown is the same @xmath73 , @xmath75 model as in figure [ fig1 ] , with background stars in the top plot and tracers in the bottom .",
    "the dotted line represents a time very near the start of the simulation , while the solid line represents a time midway through the simulation , at @xmath76 .",
    "there is a clear increase in the density of background stars in the core during the evolution , while there is also a clear decrease for tracers .",
    "more importantly , there is a significant _ enhancement _ of tracers in the halo region .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig3b ] shows the same results for a @xmath77 , @xmath75 model . in this case",
    ", the number density of tracers in the halo is very visibly greater at core collapse than at the start of the simulation , and by about 50% in some regions . even for the more modest mass ratio of @xmath72 ,",
    "a similar profile is obtained , as shown in figure [ fig3c ] .",
    "although a bit noisier than the preceding , since only 1000 tracers are used here , the same significant enhancement of tracers in the halo is evident .",
    "table 1 gives relevant initial conditions for all the light tracer systems considered here , as well as core collapse times , the fraction of each species left in the cluster at core collapse , and the ratio of half - mass radii for the two species at core collapse .",
    "we have also included a few astrophysically relevant timescales : @xmath78 , the time for the number of light stars within the initial core radius to decrease by a factor of 1.5 ; @xmath79 , the time for the number of light stars within the initial core radius to decrease by a factor of 10 ; @xmath80 , the time for the number of light stars within the initial half - mass radius to decrease by a factor of 1.5 ; and @xmath81 , the time for the number of light stars within the initial half - mass radius to decrease by a factor of 10 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a representative determination of these timescales .",
    "smooth curves were fit to the data using gnuplot s ` acsplines ' ( approximation cubic splines ) routine .",
    "the timescales show a clear trend , increasing as the mass ratio approaches unity , consistent with energy equipartition arguments .",
    "a closer look reveals a critical mass ratio , around 0.3 , below which the timescales @xmath82 , and especially @xmath83 , are roughly constant : the light stars are so light that they are immediately ejected from the inner regions of the cluster on a timescale that is independent of mass ratio .",
    "a simple derivation of this critical mass ratio , @xmath84 , proceeds as follows .",
    "the escape speed from the center of the cluster is given by @xmath85 .",
    "in the core of the cluster , densities are very high and it is expected that the two stellar species will attain thermal equilibrium : @xmath86 . since the cluster is dominated by the heavy species ( species 1 ) , its velocity dispersion can be obtained directly from the distribution function ( equation ( [ one ] ) ) : @xmath87 this equation can be integrated numerically to give @xmath88 in units of @xmath89 : @xmath90 . setting the velocity dispersion of the lighter species equal to the escape speed at the center",
    "yields a simple equation for the critical mass ratio , @xmath91 below which the light stars are almost immediately ejected from the core ( within a core relaxation time ) , but not necessarily from the cluster .",
    "table 3 gives @xmath92 and @xmath84 for many values of @xmath93 .",
    "comparison with table 1 shows that , indeed , below this mass ratio the light stars are ejected from the central regions of the cluster on a timescale that is independent of mass ratio ; above this mass ratio , the segregation timescale increases dramatically .",
    "it is possible that globular clusters could contain copious amounts of non - luminous matter  often referred to as ( baryonic ) dark matter in this context @xcite .",
    "however , it is probable that the amount of dark matter is poorly constrained by observations of luminous stars .",
    "consider a cluster with a continuous salpeter imf , @xmath94 since we want to study very light objects , let the imf extend from 0.001 @xmath95 to 10 @xmath95 ( even though such a mass function was never meant to apply below @xmath96 ! ) . to place this problem in the context of two - component clusters , break up the imf into two bins : a tracer bin extending from 0.001 @xmath95 to 0.1 @xmath95 corresponding to non - luminous objects , and a background bin extending from 0.1 @xmath95 to 10 @xmath95 corresponding to main sequence stars .",
    "( for simplicity , we will ignore stellar evolution and suppose that the heavy stars keep their mass for the lifetime of the cluster . )",
    "integrating equation ( [ fourpointfive ] ) over these two bins gives a mean tracer mass of 0.0031 @xmath95 , a mean background mass of 0.31 @xmath95 , and a ratio of the number of tracers to background of @xmath97 .",
    "using the background stars as species 2 in equations ( [ two ] ) and ( [ three ] ) , we find @xmath98 and @xmath99 : this simple model is well outside the spitzer stability regime .",
    "the two species will decouple completely and evolve independently ; observations of the luminous background stars will not betray the presence of the very light tracers .",
    "approximating the continuous mass spectrum by two bins is most likely unjustified , however , since in a continuous mass spectrum stars of mass @xmath100 will certainly exchange energy with stars of mass @xmath101 .",
    "thus light stars will exchange energy with slightly heavier stars , which will exchange energy with slightly heavier stars , etc .",
    ", providing an indirect means for light objects such as jupiters to exchange energy with heavy objects such as main - sequence stars .",
    "thus thermal equilibrium among all species may not be forbidden in a realistic cluster , but the time scale over which it occurs is unclear .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered multi - component king models and assumed that thermal equilibrium _ did _ occur among species . using analytical methods",
    ", they found that the cluster surface brightness was nearly unaffected by the amount of non - luminous stars present , for a cluster with dark matter content ranging from 0% to 90% by mass .",
    "therefore , observations of the luminous cluster stars would give no evidence of the dark matter in the cluster .",
    "( however , in the most extreme cases , the projected velocity dispersion profiles could be used to detect dark matter by observing the luminous component . )    regardless of whether thermal equilibrium occurs in clusters , it is probable that dark matter would not be easily detectable by observing the luminous members of clusters .",
    "dark matter could be directly detected , however , by its gravitational lensing effect on distant , luminous sources @xcite . by convention , a microlensing event is said to occur when a background source lies , in projection , within the einstein radius of a lens and is consequently amplified by a factor greater than 1.34 @xcite .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath102 , is the probability that such an event will occur , and for low probability , is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the solid angle of sky considered , @xmath105 is the element of volume , @xmath106 is the number density of lenses , @xmath107 is the distance to the lens ( deflector ) , and @xmath108 is the angular einstein radius of the lens .",
    "the einstein radius is given by the usual expression @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the distance to the source .",
    "here we will be considering lensing of sources in the galactic bulge , for example , by globular clusters along the line of sight to the bulge ; therefore , typical values for @xmath107 and @xmath110 are @xmath111 kpc and @xmath112 kpc , respectively . since tidal radii of globulars are typically of order tens of parsecs , we can approximate @xmath107 and @xmath110 as constant over the range of integration to arrive at the simpler expression @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the surface density along the line of sight , and @xmath115 is the distance perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "figure [ fig5a ] shows the optical depth due to heavy stars ( solid line ) and light stars ( dotted line ) for a @xmath116 initial king model with 15000 tracers of mass ratio @xmath117 . we have assigned the background stars a mass of 0.31 @xmath95 , and multiplied the tracer number density by a factor @xmath118 , consistent with the preceding discussion of approximating the salpeter imf by two mass bins .",
    "( this heuristic model therefore defines a thermally equilibrized two - component idealization of the continuous mass function . )",
    "we have also multiplied both optical depths by a factor of 5 so that the figure is normalized to a cluster that initially had @xmath119 stars and a mass of @xmath120 .",
    "generic values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 were used in the calculation , and this snapshot of the system was taken at @xmath123 .",
    "note not only the mass segregation , but also that at large radii the optical depth due to the light stars is about an order of magnitude greater than that due to the heavy stars .",
    "significant numbers of non - luminous stars may linger in the outer regions of globular clusters .",
    "@xcite have carried out _ hst _ observations of the central regions of the globular cluster m22 ( ngc 6656 ) and have detected at least one microlensing event .",
    "all the parameters needed to deduce the mass of the lens from the timescale of the lensing event are fairly well known so that a prediction of its mass can be made .",
    "assuming distances of 8.2 kpc to the source ( for a typical star in the galactic bulge ) and 2.6 kpc to m22 , as well as a proper motion for m22 of 10.9 mas yr@xmath124 ( 134.4 km s@xmath124 ) , they determine the mass of the lens to be @xmath125 .",
    "this result is exciting because it is the first such detection where the mass of the lens can be estimated .",
    "they also report a tentative detection of 6 sub - jupiter mass objects in the core ( an upper limit of @xmath126 times the mass of jupiter for each ) that has since proven spurious @xcite .",
    "although the events are no longer associated with planets , we still present our theoretical analysis of the amount of dark matter in m22 as a useful exercise , illustrating how future detections could be used to estimate the amount of dark matter in clusters .",
    "it is a simple matter to calculate the optical depth due to dark matter given these detections .",
    "since the lenses are moving with respect to the source , the actual probability for microlensing is modified from equation ( [ five ] ) to @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the number of microlensing events observed , @xmath129 is the number of observations , @xmath130 is the angular velocity of the lens , and @xmath131 is the time duration of each observation . in terms of the optical depth , this is simply @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the characteristic timescale of a microlensing event .",
    "the optical depth is then @xmath134 @xcite monitored approximately 83,000 stars for a period of @xmath135 days , and found 6 candidate dark matter ( below 0.1 @xmath95 ) microlensing events lasting at most 0.8 days each .",
    "equation ( [ seven ] ) then gives an optical depth due to dark matter of @xmath136 .",
    "adopting the same simple prescription used before of approximating a continuous mass function by two mass bins , we can evolve a two - component cluster from a reasonable initial state until its profile resembles that of m22 .",
    "we can then adjust the number of tracers so that the optical depth in the core due to dark matter matches observations , and consequently estimate what fraction of the cluster mass would have been in dark matter had the 6 tentative detections proven correct .    for our initial conditions",
    "we take a @xmath137 king model with 85000 background stars of mass 0.38 @xmath95 and 15000 tracers of mass 0.016 @xmath95 to emulate a kroupa imf  which we have extended well below the @xmath138 lower limit for which it was intended  from 0.001 @xmath95 to 10 @xmath95 split into two bins at 0.1 @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the kroupa imf is more conservative than a salpeter in that it contains far fewer sub - stellar - mass objects .",
    "( the exact form of the imf chosen is largely irrelevant , since in the end we scale the number of stars in each mass bin to match observations ; however , it may affect the percentage of light stars lost from the cluster during evolution . )",
    "we then evolve the cluster until its profile matches that of m22 , approximately a @xmath139 model @xcite .",
    "we adjust the number of background stars so that the mass due to luminous matter is @xmath140 @xcite , and adjust the number of tracer stars so that the optical depth due to dark matter in the core is approximately @xmath136 .",
    "figure [ fig5b ] shows the optical depth due to luminous stars ( solid line ) and dark matter ( dotted line ) using the prescription just given . adopting the total cluster mass and dark matter optical depth quoted above",
    ", we find that the current mass of m22 would have been @xmath141 dark matter by mass",
    ". if either the total cluster mass or optical depth are off by a factor of two , this number could be as small as 12% or as high as 35% .",
    "if both are off by a factor of two , then this number could be as small as 6% or as high as 52% .",
    "this range of values is consistent with the value quoted by @xcite of @xmath142 , but implies a higher median . using the median values",
    ", this analysis implies that m22 would have had an initial mass of @xmath143 , 35% of which was dark matter ( this figure could be anywhere between 12% and 69% ) , and that it would have lost @xmath144 of dark matter to the galaxy .",
    "these ranges of values should be treated with caution , however , since our monte - carlo code ignores the effects of binaries , mass loss due to stellar evolution , and the effects of a non - spherical tidal field , all of which may affect the fraction of light tracers retained in a cluster . furthermore , it is clear that in order to tighten constraints on the amount of dark matter , one must also refine estimates of the distances to the lens and the source .",
    "all six `` planetary '' events are no longer interpreted as being due to microlensing .",
    "more careful examination reveals that the apparent brightening observed in both of a pair of cosmic - ray - split images was actually due to point - like cosmic rays hitting close to the same star in both images @xcite .",
    "this null detection , while unfortunate , can be used to estimate an upper limit on the mass fraction of m22 in very low - mass objects .    adopting our simple prescription of approximating the continuous mass function by two bins , one containing luminous matter ( objects heavier than @xmath145 ) , the other containing dark matter ( objects lighter than @xmath145 ) , we assume that the dark matter in m22 is represented by a collection of objects with the average mass in that bin , @xmath146 .",
    "we then expect the number of dark matter lensing events in an observation to obey a poisson distribution . adopting a mean of 1 dark matter lensing event , using @xmath147 for a @xmath146 lens , and performing essentially the same analysis as in sec .",
    "3.3 , a null detection yields an upper limit on the current mass fraction of m22 in very low - mass objects of @xmath8 at the 63% confidence level . adopting a mean of 3 events yields an upper limit of @xmath148 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "although our simple calculation is physically motivated , it is necessarily crude , since a careful analysis should take into account the mass distribution of the dark matter .",
    "in addition , there is another effect to consider .",
    "the typical separation between exposures in the @xcite observation is about 3 days .",
    "thus a microlensing event with characteristic width smaller than 3 days , corresponding to a lens mass of @xmath149 , has a non - zero probability of not being detected , biasing detections toward higher masses .",
    "since the smallest mass we consider is @xmath150 , presumably this effect is small .",
    "@xcite pioneered the theoretical analysis of mass segregation in clusters . considering a two - component cluster",
    "in which one component is more massive than the other , yet sparse enough to be considered a tracer population , he found that the timescale on which the heavier species contracts varies approximately as @xmath6 . for completeness",
    ", we include a brief summary of the steps leading to this result .    for the generic case of energy transfer",
    "when @xmath151 , the mean kinetic energy of the massive stars , is greater than the corresponding energy @xmath152 for the lighter stars , the rate of energy loss of the massive stars is given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the mean total energy of the heavier species .",
    "the equipartition time is approximately @xcite @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the central density of the lighter species , @xmath59 is the number of light stars in the cluster , and brackets denote an average over stars .",
    "when one expresses this timescale in units of @xmath157 , the overall relaxation timescale of species 1 , one obtains @xmath158 it follows that if the rms velocities of the two species are equal , as they are at the start of our simulations ( they remain roughly equal for the first half of the simulation ; see figure [ fig7 ] ) , @xmath159 initially varies approximately as @xmath6 .    to see how this timescales manifests itself ,",
    "assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the kinetic energy of the heavier species , @xmath151 , dominates that of the lighter species , @xmath152 .",
    "equation ( [ seg1 ] ) then becomes @xmath160 application of the usual virial theorem yields @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the potential energy of species 2 , and so we have @xmath163 under the assumption that the potential of species 2 dominates , @xmath162 is proportional to @xmath164 , where @xmath165 represents any characteristic radius of species 2 , but for concreteness has been chosen to be the half - mass radius .",
    "thus , @xmath166 which simply states that the timescale for contraction of the heavier species is given by @xmath167 , the equipartition time",
    ". equation ( [ seg6 ] ) still holds true even when the potential of species 2 is not the dominant potential .      for studying mass segregation of heavy tracers ,",
    "we use as the unit of time the overall cluster relaxation time , @xmath54 , given by equation ( [ time2 ] ) .",
    "this time differs from @xmath157 ( given by equation [ time3 ] ) , the relaxation time of species 1 and the unit of time in equation ( [ seg3 ] ) , by a factor close to unity that varies slowly among sets of initial conditions .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 also differs from the half - mass relaxation time , @xmath62 ( given by equation [ time4 ] ) , the unit of time used in the preceding sections for studying light tracers .",
    "a good rule of thumb is that @xmath168 @xcite .    to determine the mass segregation timescale  which should approximately equal @xmath167 from equation ( [ seg6 ] ) , but which we label @xmath169we look at the number of tracers in the halo , defined to be the region between the half - mass radius and the tidal radius , as a function of time and fit to it a decaying exponential .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows a representative determination of this timescale for a @xmath116 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 model .",
    "note that the exponential fit is only meaningful for the first few half - mass relaxation times , during which the ratio of velocity dispersions @xmath172 does nt change appreciably .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows this ratio hovering at unity for nearly the first half of the simulation .",
    "( for reference , @xmath173 averaged over the core is shown as a dotted line",
    ". this curve approaches 2/3 , consistent with thermal equilibrium . )",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows @xmath169 as a function of @xmath174 for king initial models with @xmath116 , 7 , and 10 . in all cases",
    ", the mass segregation timescale shows a clear @xmath6 dependence , as expected from equation ( [ seg3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] gives another look at the segregation , showing the ratio of half - mass radii of the tracers to the background stars .",
    "table 2 gives relevant initial conditions for all the heavy tracer systems considered here , as well as the thermal equilibrium stability parameters @xmath42 and @xmath175 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ two ] ) and  ( [ three ] ) ) , core collapse times , and the ratio of half - mass radii for the two species at core collapse . similarly to table 1 we have included the following astrophysically relevant timescales : @xmath176 , the @xmath177-folding timescale shown in figure [ fig8 ] ; @xmath78 , the time for the number of heavy stars within the initial core radius to increase by a factor of 1.5 ; @xmath79 , the time for the number of heavy stars within the initial core radius to increase by a factor of 10 ; and @xmath80 , the time for the number of heavy stars within the initial half - mass radius to increase by 1.5 . here",
    "again , the trend is clear : the closer the mass ratio is to unity , the longer it takes the heavy tracers to sink into the core .",
    "the shorter core collapse time scales for the models with larger @xmath174 or larger @xmath93 give these clusters little time to evolve dynamically .",
    "consequently , mass segregation is not as pronounced in these clusters , as is evident from table 2 .",
    "we have studied the mass segregation of both light and heavy tracers in two - component star clusters .",
    "the calculations were performed using our recently developed monte carlo code using @xmath5 stars , with a few key calculations repeated using a direct code running on grape computers .",
    "the two methods showed good agreement in all cases .",
    "the large @xmath0 that can be used in monte carlo simulations is essential for this type of study , as it allows us to treat a small tracer population of objects without suffering large numerical noise .",
    "we found that light tracers with @xmath178 ( depending on cluster parameters ) are ejected from the cluster core , on average , within one central relaxation time ( @xmath179yr for most globular clusters ) .",
    "the cores of globular clusters should therefore be largely devoid of stars of mass @xmath180 . as a result , we predict that any observed low - mass star in a dense globular cluster core is most probably part of a binary system with a more massive companion . for example , low - mass helium white dwarfs observed in a cluster core are most probably in binary systems ( taylor et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "some of the low - mass objects , when they are ejected from the central region of the cluster , settle in the outer halo , where the relaxation time is so long that they are prevented from further segregation or evaporation through the tidal boundary .",
    "we found in our simulations that the number density of light tracers in the outer parts of the cluster can actually become significantly higher than it was initially .",
    "we studied the implications of these results for gravitational microlensing in globular clusters and found that low - mass objects in the cluster halo can dominate the optical depth for microlensing by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "we applied these results to the recent null detection of @xcite to estimate an upper limit on the current mass fraction of m22 in very low - mass objects of @xmath8 at the 63% confidence level . for clusters with heavy tracers ( @xmath4 ) we found good agreement between our monte carlo results and direct integrations , as well as simple theoretical estimates .",
    "in particular , we found that the time scale for mass segregation , @xmath169 , varies as @xmath6 , as expected from theoretical predictions .",
    "specifically , over a wide range of initial cluster concentrations and mass ratios , @xmath181 , where the constant @xmath182 .",
