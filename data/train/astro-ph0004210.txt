    "the observed correlation between the ages and velocity dispersions of solar neighborhood stars has been a subject of study since the work of spitzer and schwarzschild ( 1951 ) and ( 1953 ) .",
    "spitzer and schwarzschild established that scattering of stars from initially circular orbits into more eccentric and inclined orbits was a likely explanation for the increase in velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , with age @xmath2 .",
    "they suggested that massive gas clouds ( then undetected ) were responsible .",
    "molecular clouds were thought to be the sole scattering agents ( e.g. , @xcite ) until @xcite showed that the observed ratio of the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane and that towards the galactic center , @xmath3 , was too low to be consistent with the predictions from this scattering process .",
    "there was also a discrepancy between the predicted and then measured relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 : if @xmath4 , models predicted @xmath5 , while observations of the time yielded @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this resulted in the development of models that incorporated the heating of the stellar disk from transient spiral structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in addition to scattering from molecular clouds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the measured value of @xmath7 depended on stellar age estimates that were necessarily highly uncertain .",
    "however , parallaxes from the hipparcos satellite , along with improvements in stellar evolution models for low - mass stars , have made it possible in the past few years to estimate the ages of stars in the solar neighborhood more precisely than previously possible ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "imprecise ages not only add scatter to a plot of stellar dispersion versus age but also smooth over any underlying structure in this relation that might actually exist in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the theoretical work by @xcite and @xcite was motivated in part by the smooth form of the age dispersion relation advocated by @xcite .",
    "however @xcite and @xcite suggested that the observations were more consistent with little or no heating between 3 and 10 gyrs and an abrupt increase in the dispersion occurring at about 10 gyrs .",
    "@xcite suggested that disk heating mechanisms saturated or became inefficient at @xmath8 km s@xmath9 and that another process , such as a merger or large scale bar , would be required to explain the high dispersions seen in the ` thick disk ' or in stars with ages greater than 10 gyrs . the thick disk was proposed to explain an excess in the number of stars compared to predictions from an exponential disk model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the discreteness of this component compared to population i stars in age , metallicity or dispersion has been difficult to establish ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stellar evolution models for the solar neighborhood have supported both forms for the age dispersion relation .",
    "@xcite found that a jump at 8 gyrs in the age dispersion relation was required to fit the stellar dispersions and other observational constraints .",
    "however , @xcite fit the color distribution of stars observed with hipparcos from an evolution model with @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we use improved age estimates to re - examine the age - dispersion correlation .",
    "we then compare the resulting relations with the existing theoretical framework .",
    "we have compiled new space velocity components for solar neighborhood stars from the metallicity study of @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained metallicity and kinematic information for 189 nearby f and g star dwarf stars within 80 parsecs of the sun .",
    "they selected stars for metallicity and effective temperature based on strmgren indices . because the stars were selected from the magnitude - limited photometric catalogue of @xcite , the sample is expected to be unbiased kinematically ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the stars in this sample we computed velocity components u , v , and w from parallaxes and proper motions measured by the hipparcos satellite and radial velocities obtained from simbad . in most cases our velocity components were within 1 km s@xmath9 of those listed by @xcite which were derived from ground - based proper motions and distances .",
    "eight stars , ( hd 17548 , 18768 , 68284 , 78747 , 98553 , 144172 , 155358 , and 218504 ) listed by @xcite have no published radial velocities , so for these stars we use the velocity components listed by @xcite . for the purposes of this study",
    ", we excluded the eleven stars labeled as new spectroscopic binaries , which could introduce spurious scatter into the velocity dispersions .",
    "new ages for the @xcite stars were taken from tables 5 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "these ages are derived in the same manner as those of @xcite , that is , by comparing each star s position in the hr diagram with theoretical stellar evolution tracks , but are based on hipparcos parallax measurements and the isochrones of @xcite , as opposed to the isochrones from @xcite used by @xcite .",
    "the precision in derived ages depends on how far a given star lies from the main sequence .",
    "stars close to the main sequence have larger uncertainties because of the smaller spacing between evolution tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "the uncertainty is generally between 0.05 and 0.3 dex , though there are cases where the uncertainty is particularly large ; for example , for hr 5459 ( @xmath7 cen a ) the @xcite and the @xcite ages differ by a factor of two ! another example , hd 148816 , was assigned an age of 13.5 gyr by @xcite , but was assigned an age of only 5.3 gyr by @xcite .",
    "its v velocity of @xmath11220 km s@xmath9 suggests that hd 148816 is actually a halo star which would be consistent with the larger age .",
    "nevertheless , we exclude hd 148816 from our analysis because of the uncertainty ; if included at the @xcite age , it increases the velocity dispersion in the log age = 0.70.8 bin from 42 km s@xmath9 to about 70 km s@xmath9 .",
    "for this reason we excluded two additional stars for which the @xcite and @xcite ages differed by more than 0.3 dex .",
    "although the actual uncertainties ( particularly systematic errors ) in the stellar ages are difficult to quantify , these ages are undoubtedly a major improvement over the ages estimated during the 1970s ( e.g. , @xcite ) which typically used mean ages for groups of stars of similar spectral types .",
    "figure 1 shows the complete set of u , v , and w velocities for all stars in our sample ( where u is defined as positive toward the galactic center , v is positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and w is positive toward the north galactic pole ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the total and u , v , w velocity dispersions derived from these data as a function of stellar age ( values are given in table 1 for each age bin ) .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the scatter of the stars in each bin and so represent the statistical error in the velocity dispersions only .",
    "a comparison of the bottom panel of figure 1 with the corresponding figure 16b of @xcite and the similar figure of @xcite shows that the we find a slight , but noticeable reduction in the scatter in the w velocities .",
    "a similar effect was noted by @xcite for the scatter in the age - metallicity relation compared to that found by @xcite .",
    "we see from figure 2 that there is a statistically significant and abrupt increase in all velocity components of the velocity dispersion at a stellar age of @xmath0 gyrs .",
    "if we use the size of the errorbars on the points to represent our uncertainty then the dispersion at 12 gyrs is @xmath13 in the individual components and @xmath14 in the total dispersion above the dispersions from 5 - 9 gyrs .",
    "note that the data in figure 2 show velocity dispersions computed directly from the velocity data , with no weightings .",
    "@xcite advocated weighting the velocity differences by the amplitude of the w component , appropriate for stars moving in a harmonic potential .",
    "a harmonic potential is appropriate for the low velocity dispersion stars . for stars which spend most of their orbit above the bulk of the stellar population",
    "the weighting should be somewhat larger .",
    "we show the results of weighting by @xmath15 in figure 3 . in general , the results are the same , with the exception that the jump in the u dispersion is reduced .",
    "nevertheless , the jump in @xmath1 at 9 gyr remains significant .",
    "we also note that our derived dispersions for the oldest ( thick disk ) stars are in excellent agreement with the values determined by @xcite , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) = ( 46@xmath194 , 50@xmath194 , 35@xmath193 ) km s@xmath9 .",
    "figure 4 shows the uv plane distribution of the stars in 4 different age bins and illustrates that there is little difference in the uv plane distribution of the stars with ages between 2.5 and 5 gyrs and those between 5 and 9 gyrs .",
    "we have been unable to imagine a selection effect that could lead to kinematic biases in the sample . although the stellar selection criteria used by @xcite causes the sample to contain a larger fraction of metal - poor stars than is actually the case in the solar neighborhood , contamination by halo stars is unlikely because the halo contributes less than 1% to the local stellar space density ( @xcite ) .",
    "only one strong candidate for a halo star ( hd  148816 ) is present in the sample .",
    "the @xcite sample may also be biased against selection of old , metal - rich stars , but it is not clear that this would result in a bias against an old , low velocity dispersion component if it exists .",
    "we therefore suspect that there is a genuine increase in the dispersion at an age of about 9 gyrs , which we associate with the onset of the thick disk .",
    "we can see from the figures that this increase happened on a timescale less than a few gyrs .",
    "an abrupt large increase is inconsistent with scattering models involving either molecular clouds or spiral arms .",
    "the only process discussed in the literature that could cause such an abrupt and large increase in the velocity dispersion would be a merger that did not completely destroy the disk of the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that the milky way could have survived merging with a smaller galaxy of up to 1/3 of the milky way s mass ( at that time )",
    ". such a merger would result in significant thickening of the disk .",
    "based on the statistics of lopsided galaxies , @xcite estimate that minor mergers occur in an @xmath20 galaxy about every 10 gyrs .",
    "this is consistent with the possibility that the milky way suffered such an event @xmath21 gyrs ago .",
    "cosmological models also predict that for an @xmath20 galaxy the merger rate would have been higher in the past ( @xcite ) .",
    "our figures show that the velocity dispersion hardly increases between an age of 3 and 9 gyrs rather than smoothly increasing during this time ( as previously proposed ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the heating mechanisms become inefficient at @xmath8 km s@xmath9 and that another process is required to explain the high dispersions seen in the ` thick disk ' .",
    "heating solely from molecular clouds predicts @xmath22 ( @xcite ) and would be consistent with the quiescent disk or minimal increase in dispersion between 3 and 9 gyrs ago .",
    "however the observed dispersion ratio , @xmath23 , is too low to be consistent with this model .",
    "@xcite showed that this ratio can be set by the ratio of the heating rate ( or radial dispersion increase ) caused by the two processes : 1 ) scattering from spiral structure and 2 ) scattering from molecular clouds . to match the observed dispersion ratio",
    "the radial heating rate from transient spiral structure must be significantly larger than that from molecular clouds .",
    "however , their model that best fit the observations of the time predicted @xmath24 which is inconsistent with what we see between 3 and 9 gyrs .",
    "@xcite assumed that heating from spiral structure was efficient for dispersions up to 70 km s@xmath9 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite once the epicyclic amplitude reaches a sizescale similar to that of the spiral arm wavenumbers , heating is much less efficient and @xmath25 .",
    "a star with such a large epicyclic amplitude would cross more than one spiral arm as it oscillates radially making it more difficult for the spiral structure to perturb the star .",
    "this lower exponent , @xmath26 , is consistent with the nearly constant dispersions between 3 and 9 gyrs shown in figure 2 and 3 .",
    "the simplest explanation for the observations is that both heating processes are important ( setting the ratio of the dispersions as modeled by @xcite ) but that heating from spiral structure becomes inefficient once the radial dispersion reaches about 30  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the saturation point or maximum dispersion reached can be compared to the limit predicted by the observed wavenumber of spiral structure in the milky way .",
    "heating from tightly wound spiral structure becomes inefficient when @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radial wavenumber of the spiral structure and @xmath29 is the epicyclic amplitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "the epicyclic amplitude is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy in the epicycle , and @xmath32 is the epicyclic frequency . for a star with maximum radial velocity @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 for a flat rotation curve with circular velocity @xmath36 at a radius @xmath37 from the galactic center . setting @xmath38 ( corresponding to a typical particle with maximum radial velocity @xmath39 ) , we find that @xmath40 when @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "km s@xmath9 and heating diminishing at @xmath43 km s@xmath9 , consistent with the dispersions between 3 and 9 gyrs , heating from transient spiral structure in the solar neighborhood becomes inefficient for @xmath44 .",
    "this is fairly tightly wound ; more tightly wound than that seen in the numerical simulations of @xcite , @xmath45 , which was adopted as limits by @xcite .",
    "this approximate limit can be directly compared to the winding number of spiral structure observed in the milky way .",
    "tracers of spiral structure in the solar neighborhood suggest that the spiral structure is quite tightly wound ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a two armed spiral is seen at k band in cobe / dirbe data with pitch angle in the range @xmath46  ",
    "@xmath47 ( @xcite ) , giving @xmath48 in the range 5.8  ",
    "this range is consistent with the approximate limit predicted from the maximum radial dispersion reached between 3 and 9 gyrs .",
    "however , the tightly wound spiral structure observed in the milky way is unlikely to efficiently heat the disk to the large velocities observed in the thick disk .",
    "spiral arms with a significantly higher pitch angle of @xmath49 ( corresponding to @xmath50 ) would be required to do this .",
    "we find that the slow increase in stellar dispersions between 3 and 9 gyrs observed in figure 2 is consistent with inefficient heating from the tightly wound spiral structure observed in the milky way .",
    "more detailed calculations are needed to more accurately determine if the slow observed increase in dispersions can be predicted from a model consistent with the observed spiral structure .",
    "@xcite found that the model cloud heating rate that fit the dispersions at ages greater than 8 gyrs ( data from @xcite ) required an order of magnitude larger cloud number density than presently observed .",
    "however , to fit the dispersions for the stars younger than 8 gyrs ( data from @xcite ) , he found that the heating required was consistent with the present molecular cloud number density .",
    "if an additional process is responsible for the largest dispersions at ages greater than 8 gyrs , we expect that there would be no discrepancy between the model heating rates and observed dispersions .",
    "the nearly constant dispersion between 3 and 9 gyrs does not imply that stars that are 8 gyrs old were heated to 30 km s@xmath9 within 3 gyrs .",
    "it may be that the oldest stars were heated initially to a lower value ( which might have been more consistent with a less massive disk ) then subsequently were slowly heated as the disk became more massive .",
    "this would be consistent with a picture where the toomre stability parameter , @xmath51 , remained constant as the disk increased in mass .",
    "# 1to 0pt#1    there are two approaches to testing any scenario for disk heating .",
    "firstly the properties of stars in the milky way disk can be more carefully studied and compared to evolution models .",
    "alternatively , one can look for scaling relations betwen disk properties in other galaxies .",
    "we consider the possibility that heating from transient spiral structure has saturated in other disk galaxies .",
    "galaxies with spiral structure are expected to have a toomre stability parameter within the range @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this defines a relation between the radial velocity dispersion and quantities that can be estimated from observations ; the disk surface density @xmath54 ( which is the product of the surface brightness and the mass to light ratio ) and the rotation curve ( which determines @xmath32 ) .",
    "if the disk lies at the maximum dispersion above which heating from spiral structure ceases to be efficient , then the winding number of the spiral structure is related to the radial dispersion by @xmath55 ( see discussion above ) . if we combine this with the definition for the toomre @xmath51 stability parameter , we find that @xmath56 if galaxies have radial dispersions at the saturation point where heating from spiral structure ceases to be efficient then we can relate the winding number of spiral structure to the underlying disk surface density .",
    "we now consider how the right - hand side of the above relation varies between galaxies .",
    "disk central surface brightnesses tend to be similar in many high surface brightness galaxies ; @xmath57 mag arcsec@xmath58 at b band ( @xcite ) . at @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the disk exponential scale length , ( approximately the location of the solar neighborhood in the milky way and where the rotational velocity is expected to reach a maximum )",
    "the heating becomes inefficient when @xmath61 where @xmath62 corresponds to the surface brightness ( not in magnitudes ) which is equivalent to @xmath63 mag arcsec@xmath58 at b band .",
    "given typical disk parameters , the scaling relations given by equation 2 could be satisfied in many disk galaxies .",
    "in other words , radial dispersions could have reached maximum values where heating from transient spiral structure ceases to be efficient .",
    "based on scaling from the cosmological spin parameter , we expect that the disk exponential scale length depends on the luminosity @xmath64 with a large scatter ( @xcite ) . using the tully - fisher relation , @xmath65 , we find that @xmath66 at saturation .",
    "this implies that more massive galaxies , if they are near saturation , should have slightly more tightly wound spiral structure .",
    "this is consistent with the the general trend of the hubble sequence ; more tightly wound galaxies are of earlier - type .",
    "using observed galaxy surface brightness profiles ( preferably at a wavelength not strongly affected by dust and young stars such as k band ) and assumed or measured values for the mass - to - light ratio and @xmath51 , it is possible to estimate the value of @xmath67 for a disk with a maximum radial dispersion . if @xmath67 estimated from equation ( 2 ) is greater than that actually observed from spiral structure in the galaxy , then the stellar radial dispersion should be increasing ( spiral structure is actively heating the disk ) . if the estimated @xmath67 is lower than that observed , then the observed spiral structure is incapable of causing the inferred high radial dispersion in the disk",
    "this would suggest that another process , such as a merger or galaxy flyby may have caused a stellar dispersion increase .",
    "this kind of study could also provide evidence for past mergers in nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suspected that the age - dispersion relation of solar neighborhood stars was not consistent with the smoothly increasing relation proposed by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we re - examine the age - velocity dispersion relation in the solar neighborhood using improved stellar age estimates which are based on hipparcos parallaxes and recent stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we find that there is an abrupt statistically significant jump in all velocity components at age of about 9 gyrs , confirming the statements made by @xcite and @xcite and modeling done by @xcite .",
    "while the slow diffusion model proposed by @xcite is consistent with the theoretical models for ages up to about 9 gyrs , it is unlikely to explain the abrupt increase in dispersions seen at this time .",
    "the most likely explanation is that the milky way suffered a minor merger that formed the thick disk .",
    "the best theoretical modeling of the age - dispersion relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) was able to fit the age - dispersion relation proposed by @xcite but was still inconsistent with the observed number density of molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite noted that this problem was resolved if he fitted only stars younger than 8 gyrs .",
    "as previously discussed in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) a model incorporating both scattering from molecular clouds and spiral structure is required to match the ratio of the vertical to planar velocity dispersions . however , to be consistent with the nearly constant observed dispersions between 3 and 9 gyrs a model with more tightly wound spiral structure than assumed by @xcite is required .",
    "in such a model , once the epicyclic amplitude reaches a size scale similar to that of the spiral arm wavenumbers , heating is much less efficient and the velocity dispersion increases extremely slowly .",
    "the limit given by the observed plateau in dispersion is consistent with the tracers of spiral structure in the milky way which find that the local spiral structure is quite tightly wound ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since we find little evidence for an increase in velocity dispersion for stars between 3 and 9 gyrs old , disk heating must occur primarily within 3 gyrs of birth . however , 3 gyrs is only about 12 rotation periods at the solar circle .",
    "this might suggest that a resonant heating model or bar induced heating model might be more appropriate ( e.g. , as explored in @xcite ) to explain the rapid increase in dispersions in the solar neighborhood rather than a random diffusive scattering model .",
    "in such a model , the ratio of vertical to planar dispersions would also be set by the relative strength of the planar heating and vertical heating rates . if the ratio of vertical to planar dispersions and the toomre stability parameter are nearly constant with radius ( as suggested by @xcite )",
    ", then we might expect that spiral structure is more important than the galactic bar in heating the stellar disk in the solar neighborhood .",
    "alternatively , the short timescale implies that local heating rates could be highly sensitive to the recent history of spiral structure or the galactic bar . in this case",
    "we might expect strong variations in the heating rates and stellar dispersions as a function of radius .",
    "it is possible that many galaxies have radial velocity dispersions at the maximum value where spiral structure ceases efficient heating of the disk .",
    "using surface brightness profiles and assumed or measured values for the mass - to - light ratio and toomre @xmath51 parameter , we suggest that the winding number of spiral structure consistent with a disk at this particular dispersion can be predicted . if the winding number of the observed spiral structure is above the predicted value , then the spiral structure is incapable of heating the stars to their estimated radial velocity dispersion . by comparing predicted winding numbers with those observed in a sample of galaxies spanning a range of properties the hypothesis that disks tend to lie near their maximum dispersions can be tested",
    "this type of study could also provide evidence for past mergers in other galaxies .",
    "indeed the large scatter in vertical scale heights seen in edge - on galaxies and tendency of interacting galaxies to have larger vertical scale heights ( @xcite ) suggests that galaxy interactions and mergers may be a dominant cause of vertical heating in disk galaxies .",
    "much of the controversy concerning the age - dispersion relation is due to the difficulties in measuring accurate ages for a large number of solar neighborhood stars .",
    "we expect that in the next few years , through more comprehensive metallicity studies , and with improved stellar evolution tracks , a larger number of stars from the hipparcos catalog will have improved ages estimates .",
    "the trends discussed in this paper can then be more thoroughly tested with a larger sample .",
