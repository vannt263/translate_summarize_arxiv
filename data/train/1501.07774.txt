    "given a polynomial @xmath7 $ ] of degree @xmath2 , the problem is to isolate the real roots of @xmath8 in an input interval @xmath0 , i.e. , compute disjoint intervals which contain exactly one real root of @xmath8 , and together contain all roots of @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "subdivision based algorithms have been successful in addressing the problem .",
    "a general subdivision algorithm uses two predicates , given an interval @xmath1 : the exclusion predicate @xmath10 , which if true means @xmath1 has no roots ; the inclusion predicate , @xmath11 , which if true means @xmath1 has exactly one root .",
    "the algorithm outputs a @xmath12 of @xmath0 , i.e. , a set of pairwise disjoint open intervals such that for each interval either @xmath13 or @xmath14 holds , and @xmath15 contains no roots of @xmath8 . to compute isolating intervals for roots of @xmath8 ,",
    "check the sign of @xmath8 at the endpoints of the intervals in @xmath12 ( this works if @xmath8 is square - free ) .",
    "the following generic subdivision algorithm constructs a root - partition : the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate for square - free polynomials ; otherwise we get an infinite sequence of intervals converging to a root of multiplicity greater than one .",
    "some standard choices of the predicates and the corresponding algorithms are :    r    sturm sequences and sturm s method @xcite ,    descartes s rule of signs and the descartes method @xcite ,    interval - arithmetic based approaches and ` eval ` @xcite .",
    "the complexity of these algorithms is well understood for the benchmark problem of isolating all real roots of a square - free integer polynomial with coefficients of bit - length @xmath3 .",
    "one measure of complexity is the size of the subdivision tree constructed by the algorithm .",
    "for the first two algorithms a bound of @xmath4 was shown in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for ` eval ` a weaker bound of @xmath16 was established in @xcite .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the bound @xmath4 is essentially tight for any algorithm doing uniform subdivision , i.e. , reduces the width at every step by some constant ( in our case by half ) .",
    "uniform subdivision can not improve on the bound mentioned above because it only gives linear convergence to a `` root cluster '' , i.e. , roots which are relatively closer to each other than to any other root .",
    "but it is known that from points sufficiently far away from the cluster , newton iteration ( more precisely , its variants for multiple roots ) converges quadratically to the cluster .",
    "this has been an underlying idea in improving the linear convergence of subdivision algorithms for root isolation @xcite , and has also been combined with homotopy based approaches @xcite .",
    "we follow the same idea with some key differences . given @xmath13 and @xmath14 , our algorithm can be described as follows ( we only give the inner loop , see for complete details ) : for detecting root clusters , we use a result of ostrowski based on newton diagram of a polynomial @xcite ; other choices are based on a generalization of smale s @xmath17-theory ( see @xcite and the references therein ) ; the details can be found in . these tools and approaches",
    "have been used earlier @xcite , however , our approach has the following differences :    r    the tools used to detect and estimate the size of a cluster are independent of the particular choice of the exclusion - inclusion predicates ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this way we obtain a general approach to improve any subdivision algorithm .",
    "another difference is the method that is combined with bisection to improve convergence . in @xcite abbott s qir method",
    "is combined with the schrder operator @xcite , whereas we apply standard newton iteration to a suitable derivative of @xmath8 .",
    "the former combination is a backtracking approach to get quadratic convergence ; the latter gives quadratic convergence right away ( but perhaps increasing subdivisions ) .",
    "this has the advantage of separating the newton iteration steps from the subdivision tree , which is reflected in the bounds on the subdivision tree size for the two approaches : for the former we have @xmath18 , and for the latter we have @xmath5 .",
    "the number of quadratically converging steps remains the same in both cases .",
    "our approach can be modified to isolate complex roots ; replace binary subdivision with a quad - tree subdivision , and choose appropriate predicates ( e.g. , ostrowski s result mentioned above , or pellet s test ) .",
    "this avoids graeffe iteration ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and yet the modified algorithm can be shown to attain a near optimal bound on subdivision tree size .    in this paper , we focus on bounding the size of subdivision tree of ` newton - isol ` . for this purpose , we use the general framework of continuous amortization @xcite .",
    "the key idea here is to bound the tree size by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a suitable `` charging '' function corresponding to the predicates used in the algorithm ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "our key contributions are the following :    r    we derive a near optimal bound of @xmath5 on the size of the subdivision tree of ` newton - isol ` when @xmath13 , @xmath14 are based on descartes s rule of signs ( see ) .",
    "this is the first application of the continuous amortization framework to a non - uniform subdivision algorithm .",
    "we show that if the distance of the cluster center to the nearest root outside the cluster exceeds roughly @xmath21 times the diameter of the cluster , then ostrowski s criterion for cluster detection works , and we obtain quadratic convergence to the cluster center ( see ) .",
    "our analysis crucially uses the cluster tree of the polynomial ( see ) .",
    "we derive an integral bound on the size of the subdivision tree ( see ) . the usual approach to upper bound this integral is to break it over the ( real ) voronoi regions of the roots @xcite .",
    "we instead break the integral over the voronoi regions corresponding to the clusters in an inductive manner based on the cluster tree .",
    "the integral over the portion of the region outside the cluster is bounded using known techniques .",
    "however , for the portion inside the cluster , we devise an amortized bound on the integral ( see ) , which is of independent interest , and is analogous to the improvement given by davenport - mahler bound over repeated applications of the root separation bound .",
    "it is this result that underlies the @xmath5 bound .",
    "a simple argument extends these bounds to sturm s method and the ` eval ` algorithm .",

    "the termination of the second loop is guaranteed , because if @xmath131 s are such that @xmath138 keeps on decreasing , then in the limit @xmath88 s converge to zero ; but the disc @xmath139 contains exactly @xmath69 roots ; since , in the limit @xmath131 s tend to a root @xmath117 of @xmath140 , this implies that @xmath117 is a @xmath69-fold root of @xmath8 , which is a contradiction as @xmath8 is square - free .",
