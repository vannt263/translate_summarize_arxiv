    ".    the analysis of dynamical fluctuations can be an important tool for localizing the phase boundary and the critical point .",
    "in particular , significant transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations are expected to appear for systems freezing - out close to cp @xcite .",
    "the position of the freeze - out point in the phase diagram can be moved by varying the collision energy and the size of the colliding nuclei @xcite",
    ". a non - monotonic evolution of fluctuations with such parameters can serve as a signature for the phase transition and the critical point .",
    "in fact , these considerations motivated an extensive program of fluctuation studies at the sps and rhic accelerators .",
    "the na49 @xcite experiment reported non - monotonic behavior of average @xmath3 and multiplicity fluctuations at the top sps energy @xcite .",
    "this intriguing result might be a first hint of the critical point .",
    "therefore the efforts to look for cp will be continued within the na61/shine @xcite project where a 2d ( energy and system size ) scan of the phase diagram will be performed .",

    "r7.cm     dynamical fluctuations can be measured by use of event - by - event methods . however , while measuring event - by - event fluctuations in nucleus+nucleus ( @xmath11 ) collisions one should remember about a trivial source of fluctuations caused by event - by - event changes of the collision geometry .",
    "therefore , a suitable choice of statistical tools for the study of event - by - event fluctuations is really important . in ref .",
    "@xcite a strongly intensive measure @xmath2 was introduced . in a superposition model @xmath2",

    "in addition , in thermodynamical models @xmath2 does not depend on volume and volume fluctuations provided that temperature and chemical potential are constant .",
    "the @xmath2 measure was already used by the na49 experiment to calculate transverse momentum fluctuations ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , two new classes of strongly intensive measures have been proposed : @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in fact , previously proposed @xmath2 belongs to @xmath1-family measures . in heavy ion experiments ,",
    "the use of strongly intensive measures of fluctuations , such as @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can be a remedy for an imperfect centrality selection of @xmath11 collisions .",
    "therefore , the na49 experiment was able to use relatively wide centrality bins while studying @xmath12 measure ( up to 0 - 15% centrality ) , whereas the analysis of multiplicity fluctuations had to be limited to 1% most central interactions only @xcite .    in this",
    "paper first basic tests of the newly proposed @xmath0 and @xmath1 measures will be presented for transverse momentum fluctuations .",
    "the obtained values will be compared to the long used @xmath2 measure of @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "several effects have been studied for events generated by use of so - called fast generators . moreover , the analysis within a much more complex urqmd3.3 model @xcite will be shown .",
    "the urqmd calculations have been done for the systems and energies which are planned to be studied in the cern na61/shine experiment ( see fig . [ phas_full ] ) .",
    "we call intensive quantities those ones which do _ not _ depend on the volume of the system . in",
    "contrary , extensive quantities ( for example mean multiplicity or variance of multiplicity distribution ) are proportional to the system volume . note , that it is useful to extend the notion of intensive and extensive quantities to the wounded nucleon model .",
    "namely , the intensive quantities can be called those ones which are independent of the number of wounded nucleons , and extensive ones those which are proportional to the number of wounded nucleons .",
    "the ratio of two extensive quantities is an intensive quantity @xcite .",
    "therefore the ratio of mean multiplicities , as well as the scaled variance of multiplicity distribution @xmath13 , are intensive measures .",
    "in fact , due to its intensity property @xmath14 measure is quite commonly used to determine multiplicity fluctuations in heavy ion experiments .",
    "there is one more important problem which one should not forget about . in high energy",
    "heavy ion collisions the volume of the produced matter can not be fixed .",
    "in fact the system volume changes significantly from event to event .",
    "therefore it is very important to be able to measure the properties of the created matter independently of its volume fluctuations .",
    "the quantities which allow this are called strongly intensive measures .",
    "they do not depend on the volume and on volume fluctuations .",
    "mean multiplicities ratios are both intensive and strongly intensive measures .",
    "the situation is however more difficult for fluctuation analysis .",
    "the scaled variance of multiplicity distribution is an intensive measure but not strongly intensive .",
    "quite long ago a strongly intensive measure @xmath2 was first introduced @xcite . in the recent paper @xcite",
    "is was shown that there are at least two families of strongly intensive measures : @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the previously known @xmath2 measure belongs to @xmath1-type family .",
    "they can be calculated for any two extensive quantities . in this paper @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 , and @xmath2 measures calculated for particle multiplicity , @xmath15 , and sum of their transverse momenta modules will be tested .",
    "the @xmath2 measure @xcite was already successfully used by na49 to determine transverse momentum fluctuations ( @xmath12 ) @xcite . following the authors of @xcite one defines the single - particle variable @xmath16 with the bar denoting averaging over the single - particle inclusive distribution . as seen @xmath17 .",
    "further , one introduces the event variable @xmath18 , which is a multi - particle analog of @xmath19 , defined as @xmath20 , where the summation runs over particles in a given event .",
    "note , that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents averaging over events . finally , the @xmath23 measure is defined as @xmath24",
    "@xmath12 is a strongly intensive measure and therefore if @xmath11 collision is represented by an incoherent superposition of independent nucleon+nucleon ( @xmath25 ) interactions ( superposition model ) , then @xmath23 has a constant value , the same for @xmath11 and @xmath25 interactions .",
    "this implies that , in particular , @xmath23 does not depend on the impact parameter ( centrality ) , if the @xmath11 collision is a simple superposition of @xmath25 interactions .",
    "another property of this measure is that @xmath23 vanishes when the system consists of particles that are emitted independently ( no inter - particle correlations ) and the single particle momentum spectrum is independent of multiplicity . in contrary ,",

    "there is an important difference between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "only the first two moments : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 are required to calculate @xmath30 , whereas @xmath31 includes the correlation term @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath30 and @xmath31 measures can be sensitive to several physics effects in different ways . in publication",
    "@xcite all strongly intensive quantities including correlation term are named the @xmath1 family , and those including only mean values and variances the @xmath0 family .",
    "the already used @xmath2 measure belongs to @xmath1-type family .",
    "the definitions of new quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , however , more general because one can use here _ any _ two extensive measures @xmath28 and @xmath29 , whereas in the original definition of @xmath2 one of them was fixed to be particle multiplicity .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper one of the extensive measures will be again multiplicity , in order to compare the results with known measure @xmath2 .",
    "finally , one should mention that @xmath30 and @xmath31 have also different properties with respect to exchange @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath42 and @xmath43    for the analysis of transverse momentum fluctuations one can use @xcite : @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 and the summation runs over all _ accepted _ particles in a given event ) , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
