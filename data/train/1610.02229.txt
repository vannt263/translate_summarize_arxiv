    "in figure @xmath1 , we display the behaviour of the normalized axial as well as circumferential current density as a function of the electric field for ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt injected axially with the hot electrons , represented by the none - quilibrium parameter @xmath103    ) chiral cnt , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106,width=359 ]    the normalized axial current density of ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt exhibits a linear monotonic dependence on the applied electric field at lower field ( i.e. the region of ohmic conductivity ) . as the electric field increases , the axial current density increases and reaches a maximum at about @xmath107 , and drops off , experiencing a negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) up to about @xmath108 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the ndc is due to the increase in the collision rate of the energetic electrons with the lattice that induces large amplitude oscillation in the lattice , which in - turn increases the scattering rate that leads to the decrease in the current  @xcite .",
    "when the electric field exceeds about @xmath108 , we once again observe an increase in normalized axial current density of chiral carbon nanotube .",
    "hence there is switch from ndc to pdc when electric field value of about @xmath108 is exceeded .",
    "this phenomena also occurs when there is an impact ionization .",
    "this has been studied in superlattices  @xcite the physical mechanism behind the switch from ndc to pdc has been explained in  @xcite the normalized circumferential current density of ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt exhibits a linear monotonic dependence on the applied electric field as up to @xmath109 as shown in figure @xmath1 . especially from @xmath110 to about @xmath111 , conductivity is mainly axially and hence circumferential conductivity is negligible or can be ignored .",
    "this is due to an extremely high length - to - diameter aspect ratio of cnts up to @xmath112 which is significantly larger than any other material  @xcite .",
    "hence cnts are quasi-@xmath1d carbon materials . in figure @xmath33",
    ", we only display the behaviour of the normalized axial current density as a function of the electric field for ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt stimulated axially with the hot electrons , represented by the non - equilibrium parameter @xmath113 . in figure",
    "@xmath33 , there is a switch from ndc to pdc in a ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt when @xmath114 near @xmath115 .",
    "as we increase the rate of hot electrons injection represented by non - equilibrium parameter @xmath113 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 chiral cnt , the behviour of hot electrons change leading to an increase in differential conductivity @xmath118 as well as the peak normalized axial current density as shown in figure @xmath33     as non - equilibrium parameter @xmath113 increases , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , width=359 ]    to put the above observations in perspective , we display in figure @xmath121 a 3-dimensional behaviour of the normalized axial current density @xmath122 as a function of the electric field @xmath123 and non - equilibrium parameter @xmath124 . the differential conductivity and the peak of the current density",
    "are at the lowest values when the non - equilibruim parameter @xmath125 .",
    "as non - equilibrium parameter @xmath113 increases from 0 to @xmath126 , both differential conductivity and peak current density increase .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of hot electrons under the influence of dc field in chiral carbon nanotube leads to a switch from ndc to pdc , differential conductivity and the peak normalized current density increase .     versus electric field @xmath123 and non - equilibrium parameter @xmath124,width=359 ]    in figure @xmath102 , we display the behaviour of the normalized axial current density as a function of the electric field for the achiral cnts stimulated axially with the hot electrons , represented by the non - equilibrium parameter @xmath104 as in  @xcite    , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt and ( b ) ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) armchair both stimulated axially with the hot electrons , represented by the nonequilibrium parameter @xmath127 as in  @xcite , width=359 ]    , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt , ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) cnt  @xcite and ( @xmath102,@xmath1 ) cnt stimulated axially with the hot electrons , represented by the non - equilibrium parameter @xmath128,width=359 ]    we generally observed in figure @xmath129 that with axial injection of hot electrons in ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt , ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt and ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) armchair cnt under the influence of dc field , there is the desirable effect of a switch from ndc to pdc characteristics .",
    "thus , the most important tough problem for ndc region which is the space charge instabilities can be suppressed due to the switch from the ndc behaviour to the pdc behaviour predicting a potential generation of terahertz radiations  @xcite which have enormous promising applications in very different areas of science and technology  @xcite .",
    "however , there are some differences such as differential conductivity , peak normalized current density , critical dc field beyond which ndc characteristics occurs and finally the value of dc field above which there is a desirable switch of ndc to pdc .",
    "first and foremost , the differential conductivity @xmath130 of ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt is the highest , ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) armchair cnt is the least while that of ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt is between the two .",
    "also in figures @xmath102 and @xmath129 , the peak normalized current density for ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt , ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) zigzag cnt and ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) cnt are about @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively .",
    "hence ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt is having the highest peak normalized current density follow by ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt whereas ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) cnt is the least .",
    "furthermore , the critical dc fields that should be exceeded before ndc are observed in ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt , ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt and ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) armchair cnt are about @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively in figures @xmath102 and @xmath129 .",
    "finally , if the rate of axial injection of hot electrons represented by non - equilibrium parameter @xmath137 , there is a switch from ndc to pdc near @xmath115 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 for ( @xmath102 , @xmath1 ) chiral cnt , ( @xmath121 , @xmath110 ) zigzag cnt and ( @xmath121 , @xmath121 ) armchair cnt respectively .",
    "in summary , behaviour of hot electrons under the influence of dc field in chiral carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated theoretically by adopting semiclassically approximation approach in solving boltzmann transport equation .",
    "it leads to changes in the nature of the dc differential conductivity by switching from an ndc characteristics to pdc characteristics due to the hot electrons injection .",
    "thus , domain instability can be suppressed , suggesting a potential generation of terahertz radiations with enormous promising applications in very different areas of technology , industry and research . unlike achiral cnts ,",
    "a potential generation of terahertz radiations in chiral counterpart can take place at lower dc field which stems from our research findings that the switch from ndc to pdc occurs at relatively low dc field .",
