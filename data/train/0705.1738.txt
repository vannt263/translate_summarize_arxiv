    "the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter plays a crucial role in many important issues in astrophysics , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it is also important for understanding both the structure of exotic nuclei and the reaction dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . within the parabolic approximation",
    ", the energy per nucleon in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the eos of symmetric nuclear matter , the @xmath4 is the symmetry energy and @xmath5 is the isospin asymmetry .",
    "both the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 are important in astrophysics although maybe for different issues .",
    "for instance , the maximum mass of neutron stars is mainly determined by the eos of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath3 while the radii and cooling mechanisms of neutron stars are determined instead mainly by the symmetry energy @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the nuclear physics community has been trying to constrain the eos of symmetric nuclear matter using terrestrial nuclear experiments for more than three decades , see , e.g.@xcite , for a review .",
    "on the other hand , a similarly systematic and sophisticated study on the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath6 using heavy - ion reactions only started about ten years ago stimulated mostly by the progress and availability of radioactive beams@xcite . compared to our current knowledge about the eos of symmetric nuclear matter",
    ", the symmetry energy @xmath6 is still poorly known especially at supra - normal densities  @xcite given the recent progress in constraining it at densities less than about 1.2@xmath7 using the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter within the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model with in - medium hadron properties governed by the br scaling . from the point of view of hadronic field theories ,",
    "the symmetry energy is governed by the isovector meson exchange .",
    "studying in - medium properties of isovector mesons is thus of critical importance for understanding the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "we first construct model lagrangians respecting the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted such that the symmetric part of the resulting eos at supra - normal densities is consistent with that required by the collective flow data from high energy heavy - ion reactions  @xcite , while the resulting density dependence of the symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities agrees with that extracted from the recent isospin diffusion data from intermediate energy heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "the constrained eos is then used to investigate several global properties of neutron stars .",
    "in - medium properties of the isovector meson @xmath8 can be studied through the special symmetry breaking and restoration .",
    "the local isospin symmetry in the yang - mills field theory , where the @xmath8 meson may be introduced as a gauge boson of the strong interaction , can serve as a possible candidate to study the in - medium properties of @xmath8 meson .",
    "however , since @xmath9 interactions actually dominate the strong interaction in hadron phase , it was rather difficult to understand how the in - medium properties of the massive @xmath8 meson could be consistent with the restoration of local isospin symmetry . on the other hand , within the microscopic theory for the strong interaction , namely , the qcd which is a color su(3 ) gauge theory , the chiral symmetry is approximately conserved .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration can be manifested in effective qcd models .",
    "based on the latter , brown and rho ( br ) proposed the in - medium scaling law  @xcite implying that hadron masses and meson coupling constants in the welacka model  @xcite approach zero at the chiral limit .",
    "the scaling was treated in the hadronic phase before the chiral symmetry restoration .    as an effective qcd field theory ,",
    "the hidden local symmetry theory has been developed to include the @xmath8 meson in addition to the pion in the framework of the chiral perturbative theory by harada and yamawaki  @xcite and it is shown that the @xmath8 meson becomes massless at the chiral limit .",
    "this supports the mass dropping senario of the br scaling .",
    "there are also experimental indication for the mass dropping , i.e. , the dielectron mass spectra observed at the cern sps  @xcite , the @xmath10 meson mass shift measured at the kek  @xcite and the elsa - bonn  @xcite , as well as the analysis of the star data  @xcite .",
    "however , data from the na60 collaboration for the dimuon spectrum  @xcite seem to favor the explanation of @xmath8 meson broadening based on a many - body approach  @xcite .",
    "so far , the controversy is still unsettled  @xcite . the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking are closely related to the mass acquisition and dropping of hadrons .",
    "since the chiral symmetry is a characteristic of the strong interaction within the qcd , it is favorable to include in the rmf models effects of the chiral symmetry through the br scaling law .",
    "however , this does not mean that the contribution of the many - body correlations  @xcite is excluded .",
    "actually , the contribution of the many - body correlations can be included phenomenologically into the rmf models to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the in - medium @xmath8 meson plays an important role in modifying the density dependence of the symmetry energy . for most rmf models that the @xmath8 meson mass is not modified by the medium , the symmetry energy is almost linear in density .",
    "the introduction of the isoscalar - isovector coupling in rmf models can soften the symmetry energy at high densities  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it reproduces the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath11pb as that given by the non - relativistic models ( about 0.22fm )  @xcite , consistent with the available data  @xcite .",
    "in well - fitted rmf models that give a value of incompressibility @xmath12 mev , a large coefficient of non - linear self - interacting @xmath10 meson term is required  @xcite and thus the naturalness breaks down . moreover",
    ", the isoscalar - isovector coupling in the rmf models increases the effective @xmath8 meson mass with density , which leads the model to be far away from the chiral limit .",
    "the walecka model with the density - dependent parameters is the simplest version to incorporate the effects of chiral symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian is written as & = & [ i_^-m^ * + g^*_-g^ * _ _ ^-g^*___3 b_0^ ] + ( _ ^-m_^*2 ^ 2 ) + & & - f_f^+ m_^*2_^ - b _ b^+ m_^*2 b_0 b_0^ [ eq : lag1 ]",

    "the incompressibility of symmetric matter can be expressed explicitly as  @xcite @xmath23 where the chemical potential is given by @xmath24 and the fermi energy is @xmath25 .",
    "the rearrangement term is essential for the thermodynamic consistency to derive the pressure in ( [ eqp1 ] ) and its expectation value in the mean field @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 the density dependence of parameters is usually described by the scaling functions that are the ratios of the in - medium parameters to those in the free space .",
    "the choice of scaling functions and their coefficients are constrained by the saturation properties of nuclear matter and experimental data about the in - medium mass dropping of vector mesons . moreover",
    ", we also use as a constraint the pressure within the density range @xmath28 extracted from measurements of nuclear collective flows in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the scaling function may take the form  @xcite : ( ) = [ sc1 ] with @xmath29 for the vector meson mass , giving @xmath30 found in qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite where the memory effect in dimuon yield was studied by considering the mass dropping of @xmath8 meson , the authors cited a scaling function  @xcite ( ) = 1-y/_0[sc2 ] with @xmath31 .",
    "data extracted from the @xmath32 reaction by the tap collaboration indicate a value of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "in addition , data from the kek photon - induced nuclear reaction indicate that the @xmath10 meson mass dropping is about the same order of magnitude at the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "song firstly built effective models based on the br scaling using the scaling functions ( [ sc1 ] ) for both hadron masses and vector coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "a reasonable incompressibility for nuclear matter was obtained by introducing the non - linear self - interacting meson terms with coefficients satisfying the hypothesis of _ naturalness _ that is originated from the chiral symmetry and qcd scaling  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , along the line of @xcite , the br scaling function ( [ sc1 ] ) was considered only for hadron masses with a small value of @xmath34 in the rmf models to study nuclear matter properties . in a more recent work  @xcite",
    ", the br scaling function ( [ sc1 ] ) was taken for the scalar and vector meson coupling constants with respective values of @xmath34 , and the scaling function ( [ sc2 ] ) was taken for hadron masses in the rmf models without the self - interacting meson interactions . though the models built in these works can give rather good descriptions of nuclear saturation properties , the pressures calculated in the density region of @xmath35 , however , are still far away from that extracted from measurements of nuclear collective flows in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "people have already tried to improve the situation by including the non - linear meson self - interacting terms .",
    "unfortunately , it is not satisfactory because even unreasonably large coefficients of non - linear meson terms that break down the hypothesis of _ naturalness _ can not reduce the pressure lower enough to pass the experimental pressure - density region .",
    "the effective nucleon mass is not dominated by the br scaling ( at least at the normal nuclear matter density ) since it is usually around @xmath36 at normal density while the mass dropping given by the br scaling is less than 15% ( @xmath37 in ( [ sc2 ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that the scalar meson coupling constant that plays a crucial role in the effective nucleon mass can adopt a different density - dependent scaling from that of the vector meson .",
    "in particular , the high pressure predicted by various models at high densities should be lowered , and this requires the scalar coupling constant to decrease more slowly .",
    "furthermore , if the scaling function ( [ sc2 ] ) for the @xmath10 meson mass is preferred by experiments , one may take the same scaling function ( [ sc2 ] ) for the coupling constant of @xmath10 meson to avoid the infinity of pressure at the chiral limit where the scalar density vanishes . in this way",
    ", the effect of density dependence from the vector meson part is cancelled out since the energy density ( [ eqe1 ] ) only relies on the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "generally , we may take the scaling functions for the coupling constants of vector mesons as @xmath40 for hadron masses ( including nucleons , if they have ) , ( [ sc2 ] ) is taken with the same value of @xmath34 used in ( [ sc3 ] ) . for the @xmath41 meson coupling constant , the same form as ( [ sc1 ] )",

    "the coupling constants given here are those at zero density . for parameter sets sl3 and s3 , the non - linear @xmath41 self - interacting coefficients are introduced ( see text ) .",

    "the resulting parameter sets sl1 and sl2 and the corresponding saturation properties are tabulated in table [ t : t1 ] . in sl1",
    "the nucleon mass scaling is not considered and the effective nucleon mass is just @xmath59 . in sl2 , the nucleon mass scaling is included , and a much larger effective nucleon mass at normal density is obtained .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the vector potential which is quadratic in density for the constant @xmath38 is known to result in a higher pressure above the experimental region .",

    "an almost linear dependence of the symmetry energy on the density is expected from eq.([esym ] ) .",
    "the symmetry energy as a function of density is shown in fig.[figse ] . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the symmetry energy extracted from the isospin diffusion data is parameterized as @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",

    "@xcite , the authors pointed out that with the in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections , a symmetry energy of @xmath69 for @xmath70 was found most acceptable compared to the isospin diffusion data .",

    "it is thus interesting to examine predictions within the rmf models with the chiral limit at high densities .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    our strategy is to first fit the symmetry energies constrained at low densities by modifying the coefficient @xmath71 in ( [ sc3 ] ) , and then predict the symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "the modified symmetry energy is shown in fig.[figse ] with the dashed blue curve denoted as sl@xmath72 . considering the nucleon effective mass at normal density is a little large in sl1 , we introduce a coefficient @xmath73 in ( [ sc3 ] ) to reduce it to the value of @xmath74 .",
    "the new parameter set is called sl@xmath72 and also listed in table [ t : t1 ] .",
    "the different parameterizations in sl1 and sl@xmath72 lead to significantly difference in pressure at high densities as shown in fig.[pden ] .",
    "however , the suppression of the symmetry energy in sl@xmath72 at high densities is dominated by the density dependence of the ratio @xmath39 in ( [ esym ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by comparing results shown in table [ t : t1 ] and fig.[figse ] that the density dependence of the symmetry energy does not change much by the different nucleon effective masses of various parameter sets . in the density - dependent rmf model  @xcite , the dropping of ratios like the @xmath38 or @xmath39 is induced by the many - body correlation contributions .",
    "though the mechanism is different from the present study , the correlation effect beyond the mean - field approximation may play some role in obtaining the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",
    "the symmetry energy at high densities from the mdi interaction with x=0 is quite close to that given by the sl1@xmath51 .",
    "this is not surprising since the sl1@xmath51 is rendered to have the same symmetry energies as the mdi(x=0 ) at low densities . on the other hand , this justifies the consistency of the symmetry energy given by both models at high densities .",
    "one can freely adjust @xmath71 to fit the symmetry energies given by the mdi(x=-1 ) model at low densities and then examine the behavior at high densities .",
    "however , the @xmath39 will increase with density by doing so , which is contrary to the empirical cases  @xcite .",
    "therefore , based on the br scaling the symmetry energy at high densities is expected to be between those given by the sl1 and the sl1@xmath51 .",
    "is just the same as the sl1 but with @xmath75 .",
    "[ fmsr],scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we now turn to the astrophysical implications of the eos s constrained above .",
    "generally speaking , these eos s have the special features of being soft at moderate densities and stiff at high densities ( see fig .",
    "[ pden ] ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to compare predictions using these eos s with the recent astrophysical observations .",
    "recent studies on the millisecond pulsar psr j0751 + 1807 suggest that it has a mass of @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) confidence@xcite .",
    "since the maximum mass of neutron star is more sensitive to the eos at high densities , this requires a rather stiff eos at least at high densities . in fig.[fmsr ] , we plot the mass - radius correlation of neutron stars obtained from solving the standard tov equation . in the models with chiral limits , hadron masses approach zero at certain critical baryon densities ( see table  [ t : t1 ] ) .",
    "the maximum central energy density in a neutron star is that calculated at the maximum baryon density . with sl1 ,",
    "the maximum neutron star mass is 2.04@xmath0 with a radius of r=9.89 km .",
    "with sl2 , these two observables are 2.17@xmath0 and r=10.13 km , respectively . as the nucleon effective mass at normal density",
    "is reduced by introducing the parameter @xmath73 , the maximum neutron star mass also drops .",
    "this is owing to that the introduction of @xmath73 softens the eos at high densities and the energy density at the critical density is thus lowered .",
    "with sl1@xmath51 , the nucleon effective mass is @xmath79 at @xmath7 , and the maximum neutron star mass is @xmath80 . for a moderate value of @xmath81",
    ", we can obtain a moderately larger neutron star mass @xmath82 .",
    "recent measurements on the neutron star exo 07482 - 676 gave a mass of @xmath83 and a radius of @xmath84 km  @xcite .",
    "the author indicated that the existence of such a massive neutron star rules out all the soft eos s of neutron - star matter . among the models studied here , only the parameter set sl3 can give values close to the measurement for the exo 07482 - 676 .",
    "however , the parameter set sl3 gives a pressure at @xmath85 that is too strong compared to that constrained by the collective flow data in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . for the other parameter sets , the radii of maximum mass neutron stars are just around 10 km , which is below that given in @xcite , though the maximum mass can be within the error bars of the measurement ( except for sl1@xmath51 ) .    compared to the eos obtained using the fsugold parameter set  @xcite",
    "the eos s in the present study are stiffer at high densities although they have the same incompressibility @xmath12 mev at normal density ( see fig.[pden ] ) . the eos s obtained here thus also result in larger maximum masses of neutron stars . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors predicted a radius span of 11.5km@xmath86r@xmath8613.6 km for the 1.4@xmath0 canonical neutron star . using the eos s obtained in the present work ,",
    "we obtain here a radius span of 11.9km@xmath86r@xmath8613.1 km for the 1.4@xmath0 neutron star , which is comparable with that obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "in summary , within the rmf framework we have constructed several new model lagrangians using in - medium hadron properties according to the brown - rho scaling due to the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities .",
    "the model parameters are determined such that the symmetric part of the resulting eos s at supra - normal densities are consistent with that required by the collective flow data from high energy heavy - ion reactions , while the resulting density dependence of the symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities agrees with that extracted from the recent isospin diffusion data from intermediate energy heavy - ion reactions .",
    "the rearrangement terms are found to play an important role in softening the eos at moderate densities .",
    "the symmetry energy depends on the in - medium hadron properties that are characteristic of the chiral symmetry restoration at the critical density according to the br scaling .",
    "the resulting eos s are then used to examine global properties of neutron stars .",
    "it is found that the radius of a 1.4@xmath0 neutron star is in the range of 11.9km@xmath1r@xmath113.1 km .",
    "compared to other eos s , the current eos s have the special feature of being soft at intermediate densities but stiff at high densities naturally .",
    "this feature is important to produce a heavier maximum neutron star mass around 2.0@xmath0 consistent with recent observations .",

    "<S> using in - medium hadron properties according to the brown - rho scaling due to the chiral symmetry restoration at high densities and considering naturalness of the coupling constants , we have newly constructed several relativistic mean - field lagrangians with chiral limits . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters are adjusted such that the symmetric part of the resulting equation of state at supra - normal densities is consistent with that required by the collective flow data from high energy heavy - ion reactions , while the resulting density dependence of the symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities agrees with that extracted from the recent isospin diffusion data from intermediate energy heavy - ion reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting equations of state have the special feature of being soft at intermediate densities but stiff at high densities naturally . with these constrained equations of state </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the radius of a 1.4@xmath0 canonical neutron star is in the range of 11.9 km@xmath1r@xmath113.1 km , and the maximum neutron star mass is around 2.0@xmath0 close to the recent observations .    </S>",
