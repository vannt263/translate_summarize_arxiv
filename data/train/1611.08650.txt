    "recent years have seen a great expansion of topological quantum materials beyond time - reversal - invariant topological insulators @xcite , driven by the search for symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) states of matter that are distinct from trivial states only in the presence of certain symmetry .",
    "this underlying symmetry can be associated with conservation of internal quantum numbers such as charge and spin @xcite , or with spatial operations such as rotation and reflection  @xcite . since spatial symmetry is a common property of all crystals , a wide array of topological band insulators protected by various crystal symmetries , commonly referred to as topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) @xcite , has been theorized .",
    "the hallmark of a tci is the existence of topologically protected gapless excitations on surfaces that preserve the relevant crystal symmetry .",
    "a notable class of tcis protected by reflection symmetry was predicted and observed in the iv - vi semiconductors sn@xmath3pb@xmath4(te , se ) @xcite , and the symmetry protection of the topological surface states has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "more recently , tcis have been generalized to band insulators with magnetic point group symmetries @xcite , nonsymmorphic symmetries  @xcite , and with both glide reflection and time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , topological insulators protected by translation @xcite and magnetic translation symmetry @xcite were studied in early works .",
    "the interplay between topology and crystallography is continuing to knit together abstract mathematics and real materials .",
    "recently , a new type of electronic tcis protected by reflection symmetry has been theoretically constructed @xcite , which is enabled by electron interactions and do not exist in free fermion systems . in a broader context , interaction - enabled topological crystalline phases were also been found in fermion superconductors @xcite and boson insulators @xcite .",
    "such phases are now attracting wide attention , and it is of great interest to find their material realizations and experimental signatures .    in this work ,",
    "we find a new class of interaction - enabled topological crystalline insulators in two and three dimensions , which are protected by time - reversal ( @xmath0 ) and reflection / rotation symmetry ( @xmath1 ) , or simply the combined symmetry @xmath5 .",
    "this phase exists in systems of spin-@xmath6 electrons with spin - orbit interaction , and can not be adiabatically connected to any slater insulator in the presence of @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "instead , this phase admits a natural description in terms of a magnetic system of interacting spins , hence is termed `` topological crystalline magnets '' ( tcms ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of tcms is the presence of gapless spin excitations on the edge parallel to the axis of reflection .",
    "these edge states exhibit strongly anisotropic response to magnetic fields in directions parallel and perpendicular to edge .    our model for two- and three - dimensional tcms",
    "is adiabatically connected to an array of _ decoupled _ one - dimensional symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) states , on which the @xmath5 symmetry acts as an internal anti - unitary @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "this stacking approach provides a unifying description of all previously known topological crystalline insulators @xcite , both with @xcite and without @xcite interactions .",
    "the one - dimensional spt state serving as the building block of our higher dimensional tcms apparently looks similar to , but , in fact , is remarkably different from the affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki ( aklt ) state  @xcite .",
    "the aklt state belongs to the haldane phase , which is a _",
    "bosonic _ spt phase protected , for example , by the dihedral ( @xmath8 ) symmetry or the time - reversal symmetry  @xcite . however , the haldane phase is not a _ fermionic _ spt phase and is hence trivial as an electronic phase  @xcite .",
    "namely , when we decompose the @xmath9 spins of the aklt model into _ mobile _ electrons with spin-@xmath10 , the ground state is adiabatically deformable into a trivial band insulator  @xcite while keeping the dihedral and the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in contrast , our 1d tcm state is a robust fermionic spt phase protected by @xmath5 as we shall see now .",
    "s and orange dots illustrate the edge degrees of freedom .",
    "a gapless edge state appears on each edge of a finite - size system .",
    "the edge degrees of freedom satisfy @xmath11 , which is distinct from physical electrons or edge states of noninteracting topological insulators .",
    "our 1d model is composed of a four - dimensional hilbert space @xmath12 on each site arising from the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of an _ even _ number of spin-@xmath6 electrons .",
    "the time - reversal operator @xmath13 thus satisfies @xmath14 on @xmath12 . as the simplest realization of such anti - unitary symmetry",
    "we take the complex conjugation @xmath15 .",
    "we also assume that states in @xmath12 are all even or all odd under a spatial symmetry @xmath1 , which is either the reflection about @xmath16 plane @xmath17 or the @xmath18-rotation about @xmath19-axis @xmath20 . the operator @xmath21 is hence represented by the identity operator @xmath22 on @xmath12 . in one dimension",
    "@xmath1 is essentially an internal symmetry , but will become a true spatial symmetry in higher dimensional cases to be studied later .    as an explicit example , @xmath12 can be identified as a subset of the states of two spin-@xmath6 electrons occupying two orbitals . assuming each orbital is invariant under reflection or rotation , the operator @xmath21 only acts on the spin part of the two - electron wavefunction .",
    "there are in total six two - electron states , consisting of spin - singlet states formed by two electrons on the same orbital , as well as spin - singlet and spin - triplet states formed by two electrons on different orbitals .",
    "we denote the electron operators associated with these two orbitals by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , where @xmath25 is the spin projection along the @xmath26 axis . then , out of the six two - electron states , the following four satisfy @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and span the desired hilbert space @xmath12 : @xmath30 reads @xmath31 where both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are a set of three hermitian operators that generate the @xmath34 algebra and mutually commute , i.e. , @xmath35&=&i \\epsilon^{abc}\\hat{\\gamma}^{\\mu c } , \\;\\ ; [ \\hat{\\gamma}^{1 a } , \\hat{\\gamma}^{2 b } ] = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the components of these @xmath38 operators are explicitly given by the following @xmath39 matrices in the basis of @xmath40 @xmath41 note that @xmath42 are pure imaginary and are hence odd under time - reversal symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of bilinears of @xmath38 s and is therefore time - reversal invariant .",
    "it is also invariant under @xmath1 since @xmath1 does not transform @xmath38 at all .    to analyze the topological nature of the ground state of @xmath43 , it is more convenient to switch the basis of @xmath12 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 by the local linear transformation @xmath46 : @xmath47 is nothing but the spin operator acting on @xmath48 , @xmath49 for example , the usual spin algebras such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 hold .",
    "therefore , @xmath43 in eq .",
    "is just an antiferromagnetic spin chain whose exchange coupling is nonzero every other bond .",
    "the ground state is the valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state : @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the nontrivial topology of the model is encoded in the symmetry property of the edge states .",
    "although the auxiliary field @xmath55 apparently behaves like an electronic spin , its transformation under @xmath56 is in fact quite distinct from the physical spin . in the @xmath57 basis , @xmath13 and @xmath21",
    "are represented by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath55 transforms under @xmath0 in the same way as the physical spins , while it does not change under @xmath1 ( @xmath60 ) unlike electrons .",
    "this peculiar transformation property of the auxiliary field @xmath55 can be summarized as @xmath61 on the two dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath48 .",
    "equation   must be compared to @xmath62 and hence @xmath63 of a physical spin-@xmath6 electron .",
    "one may think one can redefine @xmath64 to get @xmath65 , but even after that @xmath66 remains unchanged since @xmath13 is anti - unitary .    although the hamiltonian @xmath43 is invariant under @xmath13 and @xmath21 separately , we can add arbitrary symmetry - breaking perturbations keeping only the combined symmetry @xmath56 and the bulk gap . since @xmath56 is an anti - unitary symmetry that squares into @xmath67",
    ", it protects the kramers degeneracy on each edge .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath68 of our edge state is different from that of physical electrons has two important implications .",
    "( i ) the edge state of any ( noninteracting ) topological insulator satisfies @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the vbs state in eq .   can not be adiabatically connected to electronic topological insulators . in other words ,",
    "the vbs state is an interaction - enabled topological phase protected by @xmath56 .",
    "( ii ) the edge state of the vbs state is robust against the perturbation of attaching physical spin-@xmath6 electrons to the edge . in the case of the standard aklt model , for example",
    ", the edge spin-@xmath6 can be gapped by attaching an electron , since both of them fall into the same class of projective representations @xmath69 . on the other hand",
    ", the edge state of our model can not be gapped this way , since even after attaching an electron , the anti - unitary symmetry @xmath56 remains @xmath11 .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a simple 1d model of interacting electrons that realizes an interaction - enabled topological phase protected by the combined symmetry @xmath56 .",
    "the edge degrees of freedom satisfies @xmath11 and are stable against attaching additional electrons to the edge .    ]",
    "now we move onto 2d tcm models .",
    "this time the reflection / rotation symmetry is truly a spatial symmetry and the 2d tcm phases are hence protected purely by non - local symmetries .",
    "we will discuss two models .",
    "the first one is stacked 1d chains shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the basis of @xmath73 .",
    "the second one is a square - lattice model depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "@xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 in the basis of @xmath79",
    ".    for both models , each auxiliary field @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) transforms as @xmath82 so that @xmath83 satisfies @xmath84 the first transformation in eq .",
    "is again distinct from that of spin-@xmath6 electrons . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath85 satisfies @xmath11 unlike electrons as before .",
    "although both @xmath86 and @xmath87 themselves are invariant under @xmath21 and @xmath13 separately , arbitrary perturbations can be added to these hamiltonians as long as the combined symmetry @xmath56 is respected and the bulk gap is not closed .",
    "note that the reflection / rotation symmetry @xmath1 here needs to be site - centered [ @xmath88 and can not be bond - centered [ @xmath89",
    ". the bond - centered one does not protect gapless edge states as we discuss below . to break the body - centered symmetry without affecting the site - centered one",
    ", one can introduce a - b sublattice structure [ gray shadows in fig .",
    "[ fig](b ) ] by modifying the spin hamiltonian by weak perturbation .     of the 2d models in fig .",
    "the color represents the nonuniform perturbation @xmath90 with @xmath91 , for example , which respects the @xmath56 symmetry .",
    "the edge state in the region @xmath92 and @xmath93 opens a gap proportional to @xmath94 , while there will be a residual gapless edge state protected by @xmath11 on the domain wall .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the ground state of these 2d hamiltonians is the vbs state illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , analogous to eq .  .",
    "there is a 1d edge state formed by @xmath95}$ ] along the line @xmath96 , and another 1d edge state formed by @xmath97}$ ] along @xmath98 .    to see the gaplessness of the edge states ,",
    "we add a @xmath56-symmetric perturbation @xmath90 along the line @xmath96 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where @xmath99 is an odd function of @xmath100 that approaches to a constant @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "note that @xmath99 must flip sign at @xmath103 to be consistent with the @xmath56 symmetry , forming a domain wall around @xmath103 .",
    "all @xmath104 s along the edge away from the domain wall open a gap proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "however , the edge state at the domain wall @xmath103 must remain gapless .",
    "this is protected , again , by the anti - unitary symmetry @xmath56 with @xmath11 .",
    "this unavoidable gaplessness of the edge state signals the topological nature of our 2d models .",
    "essentially , @xmath105 s on the @xmath106 line plays the role of the 1d spin chain discussed above .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath1 is bond - centered , there will be an even number of @xmath107 s at the domain wall and @xmath108 and the edge may be completely gapped .",
    "an experimental signature of tcms is the anisotropic response of the edge state to the external magnetic field @xmath109 .",
    "we start with the case where @xmath1 is the reflection @xmath110 about the @xmath16 plane .",
    "recall that the @xmath111 under @xmath110 , while @xmath104 does not react to @xmath110 .",
    "both @xmath109 and @xmath104 flips sign under @xmath0 .",
    "the familiar form of the coupling to the external field @xmath112 is thus not allowed by symmetry @xmath113 . instead , arbitrary linear coupling to @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 , is allowed . when @xmath114 is set to a constant value ,",
    "this term breaks the @xmath113 symmetry and the edge states will be gapped and the gap should be proportional to @xmath116 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath117 and @xmath118 do not couple linearly to @xmath119 .",
    "we therefore expect anisotropic response of the edge state towards the external magnetic field .    when @xmath1 is the @xmath18-rotation @xmath120 around @xmath19 axis , the magnetic field @xmath121 changes to @xmath122 under @xmath120 .",
    "thus , arbitrary linear coupling between @xmath123 and @xmath124 is allowed . thus a constant @xmath123 can induce a gap to the edge , while @xmath114 and @xmath125 can not .",
    "we thus expect similar anisotropic response in this case too .    ]",
    "one can readily construct a 3d tcm model in the same way as we did for the 2d models .",
    "the 3d model is a 2d array of the 1d tcm chains , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for this 3d model",
    ", @xmath1 must be the site - centered @xmath18-rotation about the @xmath19-axis .",
    "namely , the rotation axis must coincide with one of the 1d chain .",
    "the gapless 2d surfaces at @xmath96 and @xmath98 are protected by the combined symmetry @xmath126 . to see this , let us again add a @xmath126-symmetric perturbation @xmath127 . to be consistent with the @xmath126 symmetry ,",
    "@xmath128 should satisfy @xmath129 , meaning that @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , there will be a residual zero mode at the `` vortex core '' of the perturbed surface , protected by @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we introduced tcm phases protected by non - local symmetry @xmath126 in two and three dimension .",
