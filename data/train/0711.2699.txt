    "it is well known that after discovering the algebra of quaternions @xmath0 and carving the defining relations on a stone of dublin s brougham bridge on the 16 october 1843 , the irish physicist and mathematician william rowan hamilton ( 1805 - 1865 ) devoted the remaining years of his life developing the new theory which he believed would have profound applications in physics .",
    "but one had to wait another 90 years before von rudolf fueter produced a key result of quaternionic analysis , an exact quaternionic counterpart of the cauchy integral formula @xmath1 because of the noncommutativity of quaternions , this formula comes in two versions , one for each analogue of the complex holomorphic functions ",
    "left- and right - regular quaternionic functions : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a bounded open set , the determinant is taken in the standard matrix realization of @xmath4 , @xmath5 are differentiable functions satisfying the analogues of the cauchy - riemann equations @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a quaternionic - valued differential three form that is hodge dual to @xmath8 .",
    "the cauchy formula ( [ cauchy - intro ] ) also provides extensions of functions on the unit circle to holomorphic functions on the discs @xmath9 inside and outside the unit circle in @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , one can recover the original function on the circle from the boundary values of the two holomorphic functions on @xmath9 and get a polarization @xmath11 where @xmath12 denote the hardy spaces of analytic functions on @xmath9 .",
    "the dense subspace of trigonometric polynomials is identified under the above isomorphism with the space of laurent polynomials on @xmath13 with the natural polarization .",
    "similarly , the cauchy - fueter formulas ( [ fueter - intro1 ] ) , ( [ fueter - intro2 ] ) yield decompositions @xmath14 where @xmath15 denote the balls inside and outside the unit sphere @xmath16 in @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the spaces of left- , right - regular functions on @xmath15 with square integrable norm induced from @xmath20 .",
    "this norm can also be described intrinsically , as in the complex case .",
    "again , the dense subset of @xmath21-finite ( with @xmath22 ) @xmath4-valued functions on @xmath16 is isomorphic to polynomials on @xmath23 with the polarization induced by the decompositions ( [ decomposition - intro ] ) .",
    "there is also a quaternionic counterpart of the poisson formula for harmonic functions on @xmath4 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the euclidean measure on the three - dimensional sphere @xmath16 of radius @xmath27 .",
    "the spaces of harmonic and left- ( or right- ) regular functions are invariant under the conformal ( fractional linear ) action of the group @xmath28 , as defined in proposition [ action - harmonic ] .",
    "this implies that the dense spaces of polynomial functions in the summands of ( [ decomposition - intro ] ) are invariant under the action of the lie algebra @xmath29 .",
    "this is in complete parallel with the global conformal invariance of meromorphic functions under @xmath30 in the complex case .",
    "some contemporary reviews of the quaternionic analysis are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this promising parallel between complex and quaternionic analysis essentially ends here , and , in spite of vigorous attempts , the quaternionic analogues of the ring structure of holomorphic functions , local conformal invariance , riemann mapping theorem and many other classical results of complex analysis have never been found .",
    "such a failure has even led r.  penrose to say , `` [ quaternions ] do have some very significant roles to play , and in a slightly indirect sense their influence has been enormous , through various types of generalizations .",
    "but the original ` pure quaternions ' still have not lived up to what must undoubtedly have initially seemed to be an extraordinary promise ... the reason appears to be that there is no satisfactory quaternionic analogue of the notion of a holomorphic function . ''    in this paper we propose to approach the quaternionic analysis from the point of view of representation theory of the conformal group @xmath28 or , better , the corresponding lie algebra @xmath29 and related real forms .",
    "let us denote by @xmath31 ( respectively @xmath32 ) the spaces of left- ( respectively right- ) regular functions defined on @xmath4 with values in the two - dimensional complex space @xmath33 ( respectively @xmath34 ) obtained from @xmath4 by fixing a complex structure .",
    "we also denote by @xmath35 the space of complex - valued harmonic functions on @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath35 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 turn out to be irreducible representations of @xmath29 and its complexification @xmath36 .",
    "if we want to introduce unitary structures on these spaces , we must replace @xmath29 with another real form of @xmath36 , namely @xmath37 .",
    "then we are able to identify @xmath35 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with the irreducible unitary representations of @xmath37 of spin @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath39 respectively of the most degenerate series of representations with highest weights . in order to develop further the quaternionic analysis following the parallel with complex analysis",
    ", we should look for results that can be restated in terms of representation theory of the complex conformal group @xmath30 and its lie algebra @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , the cauchy integral formula for the second order pole @xmath41 can be viewed as an intertwining operator between certain representations of @xmath30 . for illustration purposes ,",
    "let us consider three actions of @xmath30 on meromorphic functions on @xmath42 with parameter @xmath43 : @xmath44 differentiating , we obtain three actions of @xmath45 which preserve the space of polynomials on @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote this space of polynomials with @xmath45-actions @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively",
    ". then we have an @xmath45-equivariant map @xmath53 on the other hand , the derivation map is an intertwining operator between @xmath47 and @xmath49 : @xmath54 this map has a kernel consisting of the constant functions , and its image is all of @xmath49 which is irreducible .",
    "action @xmath51 of @xmath30 is similar to the action of @xmath28 on the spaces of functions @xmath35 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the quaternionic analogues of the multiplication map ( [ m - intro ] ) lead to the @xmath29-equivariant maps @xmath55 it turns out that the representations @xmath56 and @xmath57 are irreducible , unitary with respect to @xmath37 and belong to another degenerate series of irreducible unitary representations of @xmath37  the so - called middle series .",
    "the middle series is formed from the lowest component in the tensor product of dual representations from the most degenerate series  in our case of spin @xmath38 and spin @xmath39  so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the quaternionic counterparts of the intertwining operator ( [ derivative - intro ] ) and its integral presentation ( [ 2pole - intro ] ) are @xmath60 ( @xmath61 denotes the quaternionic conjugate of @xmath62 ) and ( note the square of the fueter kernel ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the volume form , @xmath65 is a certain four cycle in the space of complexified quaternions @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is a holomorphic function of four complex variables .",
    "the image of @xmath68 is @xmath57 . comparing ( [ derivative - intro ] ) and ( [ mx - intro ] ) we can see that the quaternionic analogue of the constant functions in the complex case is the kernel of the operator @xmath68 , which turns out to be a euclidean version of the maxwell equations for the gauge potential . there is also a similar formula that involves the square of the poisson kernel for the scalar - valued functions that comprise @xmath56 .",
    "next we study a natural problem of describing the projectors @xmath69 our explicit description of these projectors as integral operators can be viewed as the double pole formula in quaternionic analysis , presented in a separated form for harmonic or regular functions of two quaternionic variables .",
    "for example , for harmonic functions the projector is given by integrating against a kernel @xmath70 where the integration again is done over a certain four cycle in @xmath71 .",
    "this is a very interesting function , it can be computed using the cayley transform that maps the cycle of integration @xmath65 into the flat minkowski space .",
    "the result turns out to be related to the hyperbolic volume of an ideal tetrahedron , and is given by the dilogarithm function .",
    "the appearance of these structures indicates a potential richness of quaternionic analysis .",
    "the representation theoretic approach explains why there can not be a natural ring structure in the space of left- or right - regular functions .",
    "in fact , the latter spaces provide representations of @xmath29 from the most degenerate series , while their tensor products belong to the middle series that consists of functions depending on four rather than three variables . in the complex case the representation @xmath47 has a natural algebra structure that can be viewed as the algebra of holomorphic functions .",
    "the quaternionic counterpart of @xmath47 is the dual space @xmath72 , which consists of all quaternionic - valued functions on @xmath71 . as a representation of @xmath29",
    ", it still does not have an algebra structure , but contains a subspace which acquires a natural algebra structure if one adjoins a unity .",
    "it might seem unexpected that a generalization of the cauchy - fueter formula to the second order pole requires an extension of the quaternionic analysis to the complexified quaternions @xmath71 .",
    "but this is not the only reason for the ubiquitous presence of the complexified quaternions in the real quaternionic analysis .",
    "we have seen that in order to introduce unitary structures on the spaces of harmonic , left- and right - regular functions , we must replace the quaternionic conformal group @xmath28 with another real form of @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 , which in turn can be identified with the conformal group of the minkowski space @xmath75 realized as a real form of @xmath71 .",
    "also the minkowski space naturally emerges when we apply quaternionic analysis to the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom studied in @xcite ( also see references therein ) .",
    "it turns out that the poisson formula in @xmath4 yields the discrete part of the spectrum , while the analysis of the continuous part leads to a counterpart of the poisson formula in @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , the spaces @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 consisting of regular and harmonic functions on @xmath79 can also be realized respectively as the spaces of regular functions and solutions of the wave equation on @xmath75 .",
    "now the polarization is given by the support of the fourier transform on the future and past light cone .",
    "there is also a conformal map that transforms the unit sphere @xmath80 into the unit two - sheeted hyperboloid @xmath81 which induces natural isomorphisms @xmath82 thus the integrals over three - dimensional spheres in @xmath4 can be replaced by the integrals over two - sheeted hyperboloids in @xmath75 .",
    "it is interesting to note that integrals over just one sheet  the lobachevski space  do not give the correct poisson formula .",
    "another advantage of the minkowski space over the space of quaternions is that the four - dimensional integrals in the double pole formulas ( [ 2pole1-intro ] ) and ( [ 2pole2-intro ] ) will not need extensions to the complex domain @xmath71 if one uses generalized functions or , in other words , need only an infinitesimal extension .",
    "however , the minkowski space formulation also brings some technical difficulties related to the fact that the singularities of the kernels in ( [ fueter - intro1 ] ) , ( [ fueter - intro2 ] ) and ( [ poisson - intro ] ) are now concentrated on the light cone instead of just a single point in the initial quaternionic picture .",
    "these difficulties are resolved by infinitesimal extensions to the complex domain @xmath71 or , equivalently , using generalized functions .",
    "the minkowski space reformulation of quaternionic analysis brings us into a thorough study of minkowski space realization of unitary representations of the conformal group @xmath74 by h.  p.  jakobsen and m.  vergne @xcite who were motivated by the program of i.  e.  segal @xcite on the foundational role of representation theory of @xmath74 in physics .",
    "( also see references in @xcite . ) in our paper we use their results extensively .",
    "taking the point of view of quaternionic analysis , we extend , give alternative proofs and make more explicit some of their results for the degenerate series representations .",
    "we also would like to note that quaternionic analysis in @xmath4 clarifies certain aspects such as the unitary structures and the @xmath21-types , not directly visible in the minkowski space formulation .",
    "the minkowski space formulation also suggests that there should be analogues of the fueter and poisson formulas where integration takes place over the one - sheeted hyperboloid , usually called the imaginary lobachevski space .",
    "this will lead us to another change of the real forms of the conformal group @xmath83 and the complex domain @xmath71  to @xmath84 and @xmath85  the split real quaternions consisting of @xmath86 real matrices .",
    "this case will be considered in our upcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the appearance of various real forms @xmath4 , @xmath75 , @xmath85 of @xmath71 in the different developments of quaternionic analysis give rise to a more general point of view than we indicated in the beginning of the introduction .",
    "namely one should consider the holomorphic functions in the open domains @xmath87 , which , in addition , satisfy the quaternionic left-/right - regularity ( [ dirac1-intro])/([dirac2-intro ] ) .",
    "the fueter formula , as well as the poisson and double pole formulas , can then be stated in a greater generality involving integration over more general cycles in @xmath87 . on the representation theory side considering such functions",
    "allows us to relate representations of different real forms of @xmath83 and their subgroups , which might suggest similar results for more general classes of groups .",
    "the fueter and poisson formulas allow generalizations to higher dimensions and play a central role in clifford analysis @xcite . however , we believe that many subsequent results  such as the double pole formula  are unique to quaternionic analysis , and the theory can be developed in its own special direction . in particular , the quaternionic analysis is deeply related to the harmonic analysis associated with the simplest simple complex lie group @xmath30 studied in the classical work @xcite . in fact , thanks to the isomorphisms ( [ decomposition - intro ] ) and ( [ decomposition2-intro ] ) one can realize the spaces of functions on @xmath88 and @xmath89 via harmonic and regular functions on @xmath4 and @xmath75 respectively . in the next paper @xcite",
    "we will have a similar realization of the spaces of functions on @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the use of the wave equation for the study of harmonic analysis on hyperboloid goes back to @xcite , for more recent work in this direction see @xcite .",
    "another unique feature of quaternionic analysis is its deep relation to physics , in particular , to the four - dimensional classical and quantum field theories for massless particles .",
    "many applications of quaternionic analysis to physics are collected in the book @xcite . in our paper",
    "we would like to add to their list a few more important examples .",
    "we have already mentioned the implication of the poisson formula  both for @xmath4 and @xmath75  to the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom . in general",
    ", the minkowski formulation of various results of quaternionic analysis provides a link to the four - dimensional field theories .",
    "this is hardly surprising since the minkowski space is the playground for these physical theories , but it is still quite remarkable that we encounter some of the most fundamental objects of these theories .",
    "it is certainly clear that the equations for the left- and right - regular functions ( [ dirac1-intro ] ) and ( [ dirac2-intro ] ) are nothing but the massless dirac equation .",
    "but it comes as a surprise that the quaternionic analogue of the cauchy formula for the second order pole ( [ 2pole - intro ] ) is precisely the maxwell equations for the gauge potential .",
    "moreover , the integral itself appears in the feynman diagram for vacuum polarization and is responsible for the electric charge renormalization .",
    "also , the quaternionic double pole formula in the separated form has a kernel ( [ 2pole2-intro ] ) represented by the one - loop feynman integral . there is no doubt for us that these relations are only a tip of the iceberg , and the other feynman integrals also admit an interpretation via quaternionic analysis and representation theory of the conformal group .",
    "in fact , we make some explicit conjectures at the end of our paper .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that the quaternionic analysis is very much alive and well integrated with other areas of mathematics , since it might contain a great portion  if not the whole theory  of feynman integrals . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter theory  a vast and central subject of physics ",
    "might not seem so disconcerting and unmotivated anymore for mathematicians , and many of its beautiful results should be incorporated in an extended version of quaternionic analysis .    for technical reasons the paper",
    "is organized slightly differently from the order of this discussion . in section [ review ]",
    "we review the classical quaternionic analysis : cauchy - fueter formulas , conformal transformations , bases of harmonic and regular functions , realizations of representations of the most degenerate series of @xmath74 .",
    "we also give a new proof of the poisson formula based on a representation theoretic argument .",
    "we conclude this section with the derivation of the discrete spectrum of the hydrogen atom . in section [ m - section ]",
    "we extend the results of the classical quaternionic analysis to the minkowski space . using the deformation of contours from @xmath75 to @xmath4",
    ", we first derive the fueter formula in @xmath75 for the bounded cycles .",
    "then we consider a generalization of this formula to the case of unbounded cycles , most notably the hyperboloids of two sheets , which has a natural representation theoretic interpretation .",
    "then we prove the poisson formula for the hyperboloids of two sheets and apply it to the derivation of the continuous spectrum of the hydrogen atom . in section [ middle ]",
    "we begin to study the so - called middle series of representations of @xmath74 , which is another ( less ) degenerate series of representations .",
    "it can be realized in the spaces of all matrix- or scalar - valued functions on @xmath71 .",
    "then we derive quaternionic analogues of the cauchy formula for the second order pole  both in the euclidean and minkowski formulation .",
    "we identify the differential operator that appears in the cauchy formula for the second order pole with the maxwell equations and explain the relation between this formula and the polarization of vacuum in four - dimensional quantum field theory . in section [ decomposition - section ]",
    "we continue to study the middle series of representations of @xmath74 by decomposing the tensor product of representations of the most degenerate series into irreducible components , and we study the projections onto these components .",
    "we find an explicit expression for the integral kernel of the projector to the top component , which can be interpreted as quaternionic analogue of the cauchy formula for the separated double pole .",
    "it turns out that this kernel is given by the one - loop feynman integral .",
    "we conclude this section with a conjecture on the relation between integral kernels of higher projectors and feynman integrals .",
    "finally , we would like to thank p.  etingof , p.  gressman , r.  howe , a.  zeitlin and g.  zuckerman for helpful discussions .",

    "in subsection [ repro2-section ] we have obtained an intertwining operator @xmath1053 and the pairing @xmath1054 .",

    "the best obvious extension of ( [ w - pairing2 ] ) works only for @xmath1062 and @xmath1063 .",

    "certainly , the problem of the integral presentation of the bilinear pairing in @xmath968 persists in the minkowski picture , where the integration over @xmath694 in ( [ w - pairing2 ] ) is replaced by the integration over @xmath75 .",
    "but this case is deeply related to a fundamental problem in quantum electrodynamics known as the vacuum polarization .",
    "it does admit a `` physical '' solution which requires a better mathematical understanding .",
    "physicists manage to redefine the kernel @xmath1066  usually called the polarization operator  by considering its fourier transform and subtracting unwanted infinite terms ( for example , see @xcite ) . as a result",

    "then , using lemmas [ x - y_difference ] and [ jacobian_lemma ] , we can rewrite @xmath1185 where @xmath1186 this is a one - loop feynman integral , it has been computed in terms of the dilogarithm function and it plays a significant role in physics .",
    "we will discuss feynman integrals in subsection [ feynman ] .      as will be explained in subsection [ feynman ] ,",
    "it is very important to find explicit expressions for the integral kernels @xmath1187 s . for this purpose",
    "we propose to study the action of the casimir element @xmath1188 . since the representations @xmath1189 are irreducible , @xmath1190 acts on them by scalars @xmath1191 .",
    "moreover , for different @xmath326 the scalars @xmath1191 are different .",
    "thus , in order to prove that a given operator @xmath1192 has image in @xmath1086 , it is sufficient to show that @xmath1193 .",
    "_ from lemma [ pi_lr - algebra - action ] , @xmath1210 acts on @xmath1211 by sending it into the trace of @xmath1212 this expression can be simplified using lemma [ dz - relations ] , and the result follows .",
    "@xmath381 @xmath382          in subsection [ projectors1 ] we have derived an explicit expression for the kernel of the projector @xmath1220 as a certain integral over @xmath694 .",
    "the equivalent problem in the minkowski case is to find the projectors @xmath1221 by the same reasoning we get    the projector @xmath1222 is given by the kernel @xmath1223 where the pairing is done with respect to the variable @xmath1161 .",
    "namely , there exists a @xmath1162 such that , for @xmath171 and @xmath1224 , we have @xmath1225      the integrals of this type are well known in four - dimensional quantum field theory as feynman integrals and admit convenient graphical presentations . the integral that gives the kernel @xmath1227 of the projector @xmath1220",
    "can be viewed as the simplest nontrivial example of a convergent feynman integral , namely the one - loop integral for four scalar massless particles represented by the diagram        there are various techniques developed by physicists for computing feynman integrals .",
    "in particular , the integral corresponding to the kernel of @xmath1220 can be expressed in terms of the dilogarithm function and has a remarkable relation to the volume of the ideal tetrahedra in the three - dimensional hyperbolic space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can generalize our integral formula for the kernel of @xmath1228 to an arbitrary @xmath326 . in order to do",
    "that one needs an explicit integral expression for the invariant bilinear form on @xmath1086 .",
    "then the expression for @xmath1229 will be given by the corresponding integral representing this form .",
    "one can conjecture that these integrals are also given by certain feynman integrals .",
    "the natural candidates for the feynman diagrams representing @xmath1229 are the @xmath326-loop integrals for four scalar massless particles .",
    "however , there is an apparent difficulty that the number of such feynman diagrams is growing rapidly with @xmath326 and there are no obvious criteria for the `` right '' choice .",
    "fortunately , in the recent paper `` magic identities for conformal four - point integrals '' j.  m.  drummond , j.  henn , v.  a.  smirnov and e.  sokatchev ( @xcite ) show that all @xmath326-loop feynman integrals for four scalar massless particles are identical ! in particular , one can choose the so - called ladder diagrams for any @xmath326 consisting of a chain of @xmath326 boxes        the explicit expressions for these integrals @xmath1230 were obtained in terms of polylogarithms @xcite .",
    "thus we end our paper with the conjecture about a relation between the kernels of the projectors @xmath1231 and the @xmath326-loop feynman integrals @xmath1230 .",
    "we view this conjecture together with other relations that have appeared in this paper as a beginning of a profound theory unifying quaternionic analysis , representation theory and four - dimensional physics .",
