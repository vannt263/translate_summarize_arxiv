    "during the last decade , a vast amount of cosmological data has been collected , ranging from measures of the hubble constant ( @xmath2 )  @xcite to precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , observations of type ia supernovae ( snia )  @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite .",
    "these datasets are consistent with the standard @xmath0cdm cosmological model , which consists of a cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) plus cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "however this model suffers from several short - comings , namely the _ fine  tuning _ and _ coincidence _ problems ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these issues surrounding the cosmological constant have prompted investigation into alternative models  @xcite , such as quintessence  @xcite , whereby the dark energy ( de ) component is dynamic and is identified with a light scalar field @xmath3 , slowly evolving in a potential @xmath4 ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) . since this quintessence field must be sufficiently light to drive an accelerated expansion",
    ", we should expect it to couple to other matter forms in the universe , unless some symmetry of a more fundamental theory protects or suppresses it .",
    "whilst a coupling to baryonic matter is tightly constrained by local gravity tests  @xcite , interactions within the dark sector have not been ruled out by observations .",
    "a number of previous studies examined the cosmological implications of interacting de  cdm cosmologies ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) while analysis of cmb and bao have placed constraints on various coupled quintessence models  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that dark sector interactions can leave distinctive signatures in the background expansion history of the universe and on cosmic structure formation  @xcite , at large ( galaxy cluster ) scales in particular .",
    "intriguingly , a number of massive , high redshift clusters have recently been detected  @xcite which should be extremely rare in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it is possible that coupled quintessence cosmologies ( hereafter cq ) may alleviate these tensions by modifying the expansion history and perturbation growth  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to understand structure formation in cq models .",
    "in this paper we consider three different quintessence potentials and examine how the strength of the de  cdm coupling ( which we take to be constant ) affects the abundance of cdm haloes .",
    "we present results for three commonly used analytic forms for the cdm halo mass function , jenkins et al .",

    "how the dark energy scalar field behaves in highly non  linear regimes has yet to be understood and properly modelled .",
    "indeed , the evaluation of the linearly extrapolated density contrast at the redshift of collapse , @xmath5 , in cq cosmologies has recently been the subject of some debate  @xcite .",
    "to get a feeling for the uncertainty when modelling the non  linear behaviour of the scalar field , we consider two different methods for evaluating @xmath5 , ( i ) the spherical collapse model applied to cq , and ( ii ) the prediction obtained from the non  linear perturbation equations in the newtonian limit ( see ref .",
    "we first assume that all the cq models share the same cosmological parameters as @xmath0cdm at @xmath6 . whilst this facilitates an easier comparison between the models , as emphasised by ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of uncoupled quintessence , it is unlikely that they are consistent with observational data .",
    "therefore in the final stage of our analysis we perform a global fit using the ` cosmomc ` package  @xcite , a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) code , to find the best fit values for the cosmological parameters such that each model satisfies the cmb+bao+sn1a+@xmath2 datasets .",
    "similar analysis have been carried out for a large number of non  interacting dark energy models  @xcite .    in section [ cqcosmos ]",
    "we introduce the quintessence models under investigation . here",
    "we study the evolution of the background and perturbed quantities , pointing out the distinctive features of each model .",
    "we discuss the halo mass functions that we choose to work with in section [ massfunction ] , paying special attention to the linearly extrapolated density contrast at the redshift of collapse @xmath5 . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our predictions for halo abundance including a global mcmc fit for each model and we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "whilst in any multi  component system the total stress  energy momentum tensor of the universe must be conserved  @xcite ,    @xmath7    the stress  energy momentum tensor for each individual species @xmath8 may in general however , not be conserved .",
    "we consider cosmologies comprised of radiation ( @xmath9 ) , cdm ( @xmath10 ) , baryons ( @xmath11 ) and the quintessence field ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "neutrinos are assumed to be massless , forming a fraction of the radiation content .",
    "then , subject to the above constraint , we may consider a dark sector coupling  @xcite    @xmath13    where the source terms @xmath14 represent the interaction .",
    "we adopt natural units and set @xmath15 . if the quintessence field is coupled only to cdm , the constraint eq .",

    "our set of cosmologies are described by a lagrangian of the form    @xmath17 \\ , ,      \\label{quintlagrangian}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 are the matter fields ( baryons , cold dark matter , neutrinos ) . here",
    ", we consider a model in which only cold dark matter couples to the quintessence scalar field @xmath12 and in which the mass of the dark matter field is a function of @xmath12 : @xmath19 .",
    "the choice @xmath20 specifies the source term , which as is customary , we define as    @xmath21    with    @xmath22    an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ defbeta ] ) is that the mass of the cdm matter particles no longer scale as @xmath23 and hence ( with @xmath24 constant )    @xmath25    a coupling of the form eq .",

    "dicke theory  @xcite which leaves radiation and baryons uncoupled .",
    "radiation remains uncoupled since its stress  energy momentum tensor is traceless , whilst a coupling to baryonic matter is tightly constrained by local gravity tests  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the coupling @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ defbeta ] ) is constant throughout this work .",
    "the background and linear perturbation evolution for this set of coupled dark energy models has been widely studied for constant @xmath24 ,  @xcite as well as with regard to the effects on structure formation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , n  body simulations involving time varying couplings @xmath26 have revealed several interesting effects in the non  linear regime of structure formation  @xcite .    the zero  component of eq .",
    "( [ tmunucoupled ] ) ( where @xmath27 ) provides the conservation equations for the energy densities of each species . for @xmath28 @xmath29 , the direction of energy transfer",
    "is from the cdm ( quintessence field ) to the quintessence field ( cdm ) .",
    "the direction of energy exchange then depends upon the evolution of the dark energy scalar field @xmath12 and on the sign of the coupling , @xmath24 .",
    "once a non  zero coupling of the form eq .",
    "( [ defbeta ] ) is introduced , the evolution of the field is driven by the properties of the effective potential , @xmath30 , which may possess a minimum about which the field may undergo damped oscillation .",
    "hence , the scalar field velocity @xmath31 may switch sign , reversing the direction of energy exchange .",
