    "large modern surveys of metal - deficient stars in the galaxy have revealed that the fraction of carbon - enhanced objects is significant at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "the fraction appears to increase with decreasing metallicity ( beers & christlieb 2005 ; lucatello et al .",
    "2006 ) , although the derived fraction depends somewhat on one s choice of the definition of the carbon - enhancement phenomenon .",
    "many years ago , @xcite coined the term `` ch stars '' to refer to `` high - velocity '' carbon stars that exhibit very strong g - bands due to the ch molecule , and otherwise weak lines of other metals usually used to classify stellar spectra .",
    "the small sample of stars he had available at that time had spectra that suggested high luminosities , i.e. , membership on the giant branch .",
    "the nomenclature was extended to objects of lower luminosity by @xcite , who found subgiants with similar elemental compositions .",
    "more recently , surveys for carbon stars at high galactic latitude have also been made @xcite .",
    "the carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars found by recent surveys of metal - poor stars may well be closely related to these objects .",
    "an important question concerning the nature of cemp stars is that of the astrophysical origin of the carbon excess that is observed in these objects .",
    "one established scenario is carbon production by nucleosynthesis in an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star .",
    "since most cemp stars that are observed in the present galaxy are too old to be intrinsic agb stars , it is usually assumed that the agb star responsible for carbon production was once the primary of a binary system , and the elements produced during its lifetime and dredged to its outer atmosphere were transferred to its companion prior to the primary evolving to become a faint white dwarf .",
    "observational support for this scenario is found from the observed excess of @xmath5-process elements , as well as carbon , in classical ch stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some cemp stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other evidence comes from the binarity of the objects found in some ch and cemp stars identified from radial - velocity monitoring @xcite .",
    "the fraction of binary stars among cemp stars has been recently studied by @xcite , who concluded that all cemp stars with s - process element overabundances ( which beers & christlieb 2005 refer to as cemp - s stars ) could statistically belong to binary systems , given the limited observational constraints on the radial - velocity variations observed to date .",
    ", [ eu / fe ] , and [ ba / eu ] . for instance",
    ", the term s - process element - enhanced stars indicates objects that have high [ ba / fe](@xmath9 ) and high [ ba / eu ] ( @xmath10 ) . ]    however , in some cemp stars , no excess of neutron - capture elements is found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these stars are referred to as cemp - no stars @xcite .",
    "at least one cemp star ( cs  22892052 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been reported with an excess of neutron - capture elements associated with the r - process .",
    "lucatello et al .",
    "( in preparation ) has identified a few other such stars , hence the class cemp - r is no longer based on a single object .",
    "there are a growing number of cemp stars with apparent contributions from _ both _ the r - process and the s - process , the cemp - r / s stars ( see beers & christlieb 2005 for further discussion of these classes ) .",
    "the existence of such a wide variety of elemental abundance patterns associated with cemp stars strongly suggests that other mechanisms may be responsible for their nucleosynthetic history beyond those involving agb stars .",
    "@xcite compiled the elemental and isotopic abundances of 19 cemp stars measured by previous work where the @xmath11c/@xmath12c ratio was studied , and considered possible differences between ba - enhanced cemp stars ( cemp - s ) and ba - normal ones ( cemp - no ) .",
    "this discussion was necessarily somewhat limited because of the small sample size .",
    "our long - running investigation of these interesting objects has led us to undertake a high - resolution spectroscopic study for an expanded sample of candidate cemp stars .",
    "we have thus far obtained spectra for 26 stars with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph @xcite ; we report on their chemical compositions in this paper .",
    "we also analyze redder spectra , in order to measure their na abundances , for another nine stars for which abundances of other elements have been reported by previous work .",
    "based on the results of our present abundance study and on previous work , we discuss the distribution of the carbon - enhancement , the fraction of ba - enhanced stars , and the metallicity distribution among cemp stars .",
    "the evolutionary status of our sample is taken into consideration in our discussion .",

    "stars in our main program were selected on the basis of medium - resolution spectroscopic follow - up of metal - poor candidates from the hk survey @xcite and the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ; christlieb 2003 ) that exhibited apparently strong ch g bands and metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",

    "effective temperatures for the stars in our sample are estimated from photometric data using the color - temperature relation provided by @xcite and @xcite ( see  [ sec : param ] ) .",
    "optical @xmath16 photometry ( johnson - kron - cousins ) for these stars are reported by beers et al .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : photo ] .",
    "errors in the photometric measurements are typically on the order of 0.010.02  mag . near infrared @xmath17 photometry was collected from the database of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite .",

    "the extinction in each band is obtained from the reddening relation provided in their table 6 .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopic observations for the stars in our sample was obtained with subaru / hds , with a spectral resolving power @xmath19 ( a slit width of 0.72  arcsec ) , in october 2002 and may 2003 .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was used in all observing runs .",
    "two eev - ccds were used with two by two on - chip binning , providing approximately a three - pixel sampling of the resolution element .",
    "the spectra obtained in october 2002 cover the wavelength range 41006850  , with a small gap in the coverage between 5440 and 5520   due to the physical separation between the two ccds .",
    "the wavelength coverage was slightly ( @xmath20   ) shifted to shorter wavelengths in the may 2003 run . for cs  29528028 , which is the hottest star in our sample , a blue spectrum ( 35505250",
    " ) was also obtained during the october 2002 run .",
    "spectra of several stars not listed in table  [ tab : obs ] were also obtained .",

    "all stars other than cs  22183015 were studied by our previous work @xcite , based on blue spectra .",
    "cs  22183015 was studied by @xcite and @xcite , but the na abundance was not measured by these authors .    most of the red spectra were obtained with subaru / hds in 2005 during scheduled service observing .",
    "the single exception is cs  22898027 , which was observed during the hds commissioning phase in 2000 .",
    "photon counts per 0.18  km  s@xmath21 pixel at 5900   are listed in table  [ tab : naobs ] .",
    "note that although some objects were observed for the purpose of radial - velocity monitoring , the counts are sufficient for our present analysis .",
    "standard data reduction procedures ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , background subtraction , extraction , and wavelength calibration ) were carried out with the iraf echelle package .",
    "suspected cosmic - ray hits are removed using the technique described by @xcite .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ tab : obs ] lists the photon count ( per 1.8  km  s@xmath21 pixel ) collected at 5200   . since the primary purpose of this work is to investigate the abundance characteristics for a large sample , we pursued only moderate signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios that could be obtained with relatively short integrations .",
    "note also that the data quality is not uniform in our sample .",
    "one reason for this is that complete optical photometry was not available at the time of the spectroscopic observing run .",
    "moreover , our sample consists of stars having quite different colors .",
    "these factors made the estimation of exposure times required to obtain uniform s / n ratios quite difficult .",

    "the heavy neutron - capture elements in this star are significantly overabundant , and equivalent widths of the sr , zr , la , ce , and nd lines are measured .",
    "the equivalent widths of na lines for the nine other stars are listed in table  [ tab : ew5 ] .",
    "the na  d lines could not be measured for cs  31062050 because of severe contamination from interstellar na absorption .",
    "the na abundance of this object is determined from the @xmath225688 line .",
    "we measure heliocentric radial velocities ( @xmath23 ) using isolated lines .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . the standard error ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the standard deviation of the values from individual lines and",
    "@xmath26 is the number of lines used ) is adopted as the random error of the measurements reported in the table .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made using th - ar comparison spectra that were obtained during the observing runs .",
    "possible systematic errors of the wavelength calibration due to the stability of the spectrograph are no more than 0.4  km  s@xmath21 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "combining this possible systematic error with the random errors ( 3 @xmath25 ) , the uncertainties of the reported radial velocity measurements are 0.51.0  km  s@xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath23 of bs  16929005 measured in the present work agrees with that of @xcite ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath21 ) within the stated errors .",
    "no significant variation was found for this object between the two observations , taken roughly two years apart .",
    "the radial velocities and the binarity of cs  22948027 and cs  29497034 were investigated by @xcite .",
    "our results agree , within the measurement errors , with the predictions from the orbital parameters for these two stars derived by these authors .",
    "different orbital parameters for cs  22948027 were determined by @xcite .",
    "although the values of the orbital parameters are quite different between the two studies , both predict a similar velocity at the epoch of our observation .",
    "hence , our measurement for a single epoch does not provide meaningful constraints on the determination of the orbital parameters for cs  22948027 at present .",
    "further monitoring of the radial velocity of this star is strongly desired .",
    "a standard lte analysis , employing the model atmospheres of @xcite , is performed for the measured equivalent widths for most of the detectable elements , while a spectrum - synthesis technique is applied for the ch , c@xmath0 , and cn molecular bands .    since the calculations of model atmospheres used in the present analyses are made for scaled solar abundances , the effect of the enhancements of carbon and nitrogen on thermal structures is not included .",
    "this may have some affect on cool stars with large excesses of these elements .",
    "@xcite showed that the temperature at the layers where weak absorption lines form ( @xmath28 to 0 ) is a few hundred kelvin higher in the cn - enhanced ( [ c / fe ] = [ n / fe ] = + 2 for [ fe / h]@xmath29 ) model for @xmath30=4500  k than in the standard model ( that is , the model based on scaled solar abundances ) .",
    "the effect of the enhancements of carbon and nitrogen on , for instance , iron abundances derived from fe i lines , might be 0.20.3  dex , which is estimated from the sensitivity of the derived abundances to the effective temperatures adopted for a few cool stars ( @xmath31  k ) in our sample ( e.g. , he  1447 + 0102 ) .",
    "we note that the carbon enhancement of cs  30322023 , the coolest object in our sample , is relatively small ( [ c / fe]@xmath32 , see   [ sec : cn ] ) , thus the effect of the carbon enhancement on the thermal structure of the model atmosphere for this star might be less significant .",
    "effective temperatures are often determined in high - resolution spectroscopic studies by ensuring that the derived abundance of some species ( e.g. , fe ) is independent of the excitation potential of the spectral lines employed . however , since the measurement accuracy of the weak absorption lines is not so high in our moderate s / n spectra , the spectroscopic method to determine effective temperature is less than ideal .",
    "instead , we estimate effective temperatures of our program stars from broad - band photometry , although we note that the determination of effective temperatures for cemp stars from photometric data can also present a challenge , due to the presence of severe molecular absorption in some photometric bands .",
    "we first estimate the effective temperatures for the stars in our sample from their @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 colors , using the empirical temperature scale of @xcite for cs  29503010 and cs  29528028 ( warm stars ) and @xcite for the others , after reddening corrections were applied ( table  [ tab : photo ] ) .",
    "corrections for the filter systems which we employed , in order to put them onto the alonso et al .",
    "scale , were as reported by @xcite .",
    "the metallicity applied to the effective temperature scale is first assumed to be [ fe / h ] @xmath37 , and is then corrected after the first - pass abundance analysis has been completed .",
    "the determination of the effective temperature and abundance analysis are iterated until the derived iron abundance is no longer significantly different from the assumed value .",
    "we give priority to the results from @xmath33 ( @xmath38 ) , as mentioned below , which are listed in table  [ tab : photo ] .",
    "the average of the effective temperatures from the other three colors is calculated , and the differences of this average with respect to @xmath38 are also listed in the table . a typical error of the @xmath33 color is 0.03 mag ( errors of the @xmath39-band photometry and reddening estimates are usually dominant ) .",
    "the error of the @xmath40 of 0.03 mag results in an uncertainty in @xmath30 of 90  k.    the effect of molecular absorption is relatively small in the @xmath41 and @xmath39 bands for most stars in our sample .",
    "indeed , the @xmath33 colors calculated by models including enhancements of carbon and nitrogen by @xcite are in reasonable agreement with the values derived by the empirical color@xmath42 relation by @xcite . for this reason the results from the @xmath33 color is adopted for most of our program stars . however , we made corrections to the effective temperatures of the following five stars :    \\(1 ) * cs  22948027 and cs  29497034 * : these stars have been studied in previous work by @xcite and @xcite , who adopted @xmath43  k for both objects .",
    "the effective temperatures we derived from the @xmath33 colors are 330  k and 230  k higher than their values , respectively .",
    "these differences could be due to the differences in the reddening corrections adopted . moreover , other colors yield lower temperatures . including these results , we adopt 5000  k and 4900  k for cs  22948027 and cs  29497034 , respectively , in our analysis .",
    "\\(2 ) * he  10051439 and he",
    "1447 + 0102 * : a large discrepancy between @xmath44 and those estimated from the other three color indices is found in stars with strong c@xmath0 and cn molecular bands ; in general , the temperature derived from @xmath33 is lower ( the effect of molecular bands on @xmath36 color is significant ) , as was also found for cs  22948027 and cs  29497034 .",
    "however , the opposite results are obtained for he  10051439 and he  1447 + 0102 , for which quite high temperatures are derived from the @xmath33 colors .",
    "we suspect there is some problem in the estimate of the temperatures from this color for these objects , and adopt the lower values .",
    "\\(3 ) * cs  29528028 * : the effective temperature of cs  29528028 from the @xmath33 and other colors is higher than the values found in most low - metallicity main - sequence turn - off stars . in such stars , the effect of molecular absorption is almost negligible in the broad - band photometry , and the @xmath45 color also provides useful information .",
    "the effective temperature of cs  29528028 from the @xmath45 calibration @xcite is 6580  k , significantly lower than that from @xmath33 .",
    "we adopted 6800  k for this object .    for the above five stars we assumed larger uncertainties in the estimate of errors of abundance determination due to the uncertainties in their adopted atmospheric parameters ( see   [ sec : err ] ) .",
    "we perform an abundance analyses of our program stars in the standard manner for the measured equivalent widths of fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath46 ) is determined from the fe i lines by demanding that there exist no dependence of the derived abundance on equivalent widths . for he  05071653",
    ", he  11570518 , he  13191935 , and he  22210453 , however , no or only a few weak fe i lines were available , hence reliable microturbulent velocities could not be directly determined . in these cases",
    "we assumed a microturbulent velocity of 2.0  km  s@xmath21 , close to the average of the values of the other cemp giants in our sample .",
    "a larger uncertainty on the microturbulent velocity is assumed for these three stars in calculations of their abundance errors (   [ sec : err ] ) .",
    "surface gravities ( @xmath47 ) are determined from the ionization balance between fe i and fe ii .",
    "the final atmospheric parameters are reported in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "figure [ fig : teffg ] shows the correlation between the effective temperatures and gravities for our sample ( filled circles ) and also for other stars studied by previous work ( see  [ sec : sample ] for references ) .",
    "a clear correlation is found for stars with @xmath48  k , as most stars in our sample lie along the halo red - giant branch .",
    "our sample also includes a number of main - sequence turn - off and subgiant stars .",
    "we investigated the correlation between the lower excitation potential and the derived fe abundances from individual lines .",
    "we found that eight objects among the 26 stars show statistically significant dependence of the derived abundances on the excitation potential .",
    "the dependence disappears by assuming lower effective temperatures by 150250  k than derived from the colors .",
    "this result possibly implies that our calibration based on color indices systematically overestimates the effective temperature of cemp stars .",
    "however , given the agreement of the results for similar number of objects for which sufficient number of lines are measured , the systematic error is unlikely to be as large as 200  k. it should be noted that the five objects to which we applied special corrections of effective temperatures show no significant correlation between the excitation potential and the abundances from individual lines .    for the stars for which na",
    "abundance measurements are made , we adopt the atmospheric parameters determined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for cs  22957027 , for cs  22183015 , and for the other seven stars , respectively .      for the ch 4323   band and/or the c@xmath0 swan bands , carbon abundances are determined using a spectrum - synthesis approach .",
    "the ch band is used for stars that have relatively weak absorption features of molecules due to their high temperature and/or small excesses of carbon . the c@xmath0 swan 00 band ( 5167   )",
    "is applied to the analysis for stars in which the ch band is highly saturated . for cool objects with significant enhancements of carbon , even the c@xmath0 swan 00 band is severely saturated . in these instances the c@xmath0 swan 01 band at 5635   is used . the results are listed in table  [ tab : res ] , where the absorption band used for the analysis is also presented for each star .",

    "the effects of inhomogeneity of the stellar atmosphere ( the so - called 3d effects ) are also thought to have a significant influence on the determination of c and n abundances from molecular features @xcite .",

    "* ) , indicating the influence of extra mixing during evolution along the red - giant branch @xcite .",
    "as a result , the surface abundance of carbon in late - type stars will in general be lower than it was when the star was in an earlier evolutionary stage .",

    "a similar trend was obtained by @xcite for their metal - poor field giants ( figure 10 of their paper ) .",
    "we note that their carbon abundance ratios ( [ c / fe ] ) are systematically lower than ours by about 0.4  dex , although their abundances were determined from the ch molecular bands as in our present analyses .",

    "the slope of the solid line ( 0.84 dex per dex ) is also interesting . if the [ ba / fe ] and [ c / fe ] values are determined by the enrichment of agb stars and the dilution in the secondary objects , a slope of unity is expected .",
    "the regression analysis indicates that this possibility can not not rejected ( at the 70% confidence level ) .",
    "a discussion of the stars with lower metallicity can be found below .    as can be seen in figure  [ fig : bafe ] , the 27 stars with [ fe / h ]",

    "the enhancement of carbon in the ba - enhanced cemp stars is primarily determined by the process of agb nucleosynthesis in the binary mass - transfer scenario .",

    "we note that the carbon yields rapidly decrease with increasing mass ( @xmath105m@xmath69 ) , due to hot bottom burning .    given these model yields of [ c / h ]  @xmath106  0",
    ", the simplest explanation of the upper cutoff of [ c / h ]  @xmath106  0 in figures  [ fig : cfe ] and [ fig : histc ] is that the observed upper envelope represents objects in which the bulk of the material originated in the agb star and was transferred when the secondary was on or near the main sequence .",
    "the amount of mass transferred was so large that subsequent mixing / dilution in the convection envelope of these objects during giant branch evolution has not greatly changed [ c / h ] from the value that existed in material transferred from the agb donor .",
    "although the [ c / h ] values of most ba - enhanced cemp stars are found in a rather narrow range , a correlation between the [ c / h ] and luminosity is found .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : chcnhl ] shows [ c / h ] as a function of luminosity for the ba - enhanced cemp stars ( filled symbols ) and the ba - normal ones ( open symbols ) .",
    "a least - square fit to the data for the ba - enhanced stars is shown by the solid line . the null hypothesis that no correlation exists between these two quantities",
    "is rejected by the regression analysis and by the spearman rank correlation test , both at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the [ c / h ] value decreases by 0.6  dex ( i.e. , a factor of four ) with increasing luminosity from @xmath107 0 to 3 .",
    "if this correlation reflects the decrease of carbon abundance at the surface of the object during evolution along the red giant branch , two mechanisms to decrease carbon might be considered .",
    "one is the dilution of the carbon - rich material provided by the donor agb star with the non carbon - rich material of the secondary we are currently observing .",
    "the other is the cn cycle inside the star through the first dredge - up and extra mixing .",
    "however , the bottom panels of figure [ fig : chcnhl ] exhibits a similar correlation between the [ ( c+n)/h ] values and luminosity to that found for [ c / h ] , although the confidence level of the null - hypothesis rejection is only 90% in this case .",
    "that is , the cn cycle is unlikely the primary reason for the relatively low carbon abundances found in some high luminosity objects .",
    "an exception is cs  30322023 ( [ c / h]@xmath108 and [ ( c+n ) /fe]@xmath109 ) , whose surface chemical composition should be severely affected by the cn cycle .",
    "we also shows the plot for [ n / h ] in the middle panel for completeness , where no statistically significant correlation is found between the two values .    in summary ,",
    "some dilution of the envelope material in the receiving companion is suggested for ba - enhanced cemp stars from the correlation between [ c / h ] ( and [ ( c+n)/h ] ) and luminosity .",
    "most ba - enhanced cemp stars in our sample show , however , that the decrease of [ c / h ] during the stellar evolution is less than 1  dex .",
    "given the fact that the convective layer becomes about two orders of magnitude deeper when a star evolves to become a red giant , the small dilution of carbon found in ba - enhanced cemp stars suggests that a significant amount of carbon - enhanced material has been accreted from the donor agb star .",
    "in contrast to the ba - enhanced objects , the [ c / h ] values of ba - normal cemp stars exhibit a very wide distribution , with an average value of [ c / h ] that is significantly lower than that of ba - enhanced stars .",

    "is rejected by the rank - sum test at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "this result suggests again a difference in the mechanisms that enrich carbon between ba - normal and ba - enhanced stars .",
    "we note that , since the average metallicity of ba - normal cemp stars is much lower than that of ba - enhanced stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histfe ] ) , their carbon abundance ratios ( [ c / fe ] ) are higher than the criterion for cemp stars (  4 ) , although their [ c / h ] values are not outstandingly high .",
    "we also note that apparent correlations are found between the luminosity and abundance distributions of c , n , and c+n for ba - normal stars in figure  [ fig : chcnhl ] .",
    "however , they are likely affected by observational bias .",

    "all ba - enhanced stars but one ( cs  30322023 ) have [ c / h ] @xmath112 , while most of ba - normal stars have lower carbon abundances . the ch bands that are used in the usual abundance studies are easily detected even in main - sequence stars if the carbon abundance is as high as solar ( i.e. , [ c / h ] @xmath8 ) . however , if the abundance is lower than [ c / h ] @xmath113 , quite high - quality spectra are required for detection of the ch band . in order to estimate the detection limit of the ch g band , we calculate synthetic spectra for model atmospheres of dwarfs ( @xmath30=60007000  k and @xmath47=4.0 ) , subgiants ( @xmath30=5500  k and @xmath47=3.5 ) and giants ( @xmath42=40005000  k and @xmath47=1.02.5 ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig : chteff ] indicates the [ c / h ] values required for the depth of the ch g band to be about 2  % , which we take as a conservative limit for detection of this feature in high - quality high - resolution spectra .",
    "the detection limit of the ch g band in medium - resolution spectra , by which cemp stars are usually initially identified in surveys , is higher than the values shown by this line .",
    "even if ba - normal cemp main - sequence stars having similar carbon excesses to those found in ba - normal cemp giants exist , they would not be identified as cemp stars in the surveys . on the other hand ,",
    "carbon - enhanced giants are detected even if the carbon enhancement is not as significant as those of cemp main - sequence stars .",
    "ba - enhanced dwarfs as well as giants are detected because of their very high carbon excesses .",
    "this could lead to differences in the observed luminosity distributions of the two types of cemp stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : aball ] shows the abundance ratios ( [ x / fe ] ) as functions of [ fe / h ] for elements other than c , n , and ba .",
    "the abundances of non - cemp stars are adopted from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . besides these sources , the results of @xcite are also shown for na abundances , while those of @xcite are shown for na , mg , ca , ti , cr , and ni abundances .",
    "the distributions of the abundance ratios of sc , ti , cr , ni , and zn in cemp stars are quite similar to those in non carbon - enhanced stars .",
    "a few stars appear to deviate from the observed trends .",
    "for instance , he  13191935 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath114 ) has [ cr / fe ] @xmath115 , and cs  30338089 has [ sc / fe ] @xmath116 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath117 ) ( both stars are ba - enhanced objects ) .",
    "however , these results are based on measurements for only one line , and no clear interpretations for these stars can be made at present .",
    "several cemp stars exhibit quite high ca abundances compared to the typical value of non - cemp stars ( [ ca / fe ] @xmath118 ) . in our sample , three stars ( he  14290551 , he  15280409 , and he  22210453 )",
    "have [ ca / fe ] @xmath119 .",
    "however , the abundances are determined from only 13 lines in 55006200   .",
    "the three objects are relatively cool and exhibit large carbon excesses ; numerous c@xmath0 and cn molecular lines exist in this wavelength range .",
    "hence , the ca abundances of such objects are possibly overestimated due to contamination by molecular features .",
    "five stars from the literature have [ ca / fe ] @xmath120 ( table  [ tab : cempall ] ) .",
    "one is cs  31062050 , studied by @xcite , who measured the abundance from two lines in the blue range . however , these lines are possibly affected by ch molecular lines . indeed , an analysis for 15 lines in the red spectrum of cs  31062050 , which is used for the analysis of na lines in the present work , results in [ ca / fe ] = + 0.40 ( contamination by c@xmath0 and cn molecular lines is not severe in the red spectrum of this object ) .",
    "we conclude that our previous measurement overestimated the ca abundance for this object .",
    "the other four objects having [ ca / fe ] @xmath120 were studied by @xcite , who measured the ca abundances for blue lines as @xcite did .",
    "the four stars are cool giants having large excesses of carbon .",
    "although we can not further investigate the ca abundances of these stars , because red spectra for them are not available , our re - analysis for cs  31062050 suggests that the analyses for blue lines in cemp stars possibly overestimate the ca abundances .",
    "hence , we here do not regard the large ca overabundances found in several objects as general characteristics of cemp stars .",
    "in contrast , a large range of abundance ratios is found for na and mg .",
    "we find moderate overabundances of mg for most of the cemp stars in our sample , as is usually observed for non carbon - enhanced stars , but three stars in our sample exhibit large excesses of mg .",
    "one such star is he  1447 + 0102 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath37 ) , whose mg abundance ( [ mg / fe ] @xmath121 ) is determined from the mg i 5172   line alone , with a correspondingly large uncertainty .",
    "the mg abundances of cs  29497034 ( [ mg / fe ] @xmath122 , [ fe / h ] @xmath123 ) and cs  29528028 ( [ mg / fe ] @xmath124 , [ fe / h ] @xmath125 ) are , however , based on measurements for three lines , and the scatter of abundances derived from individual lines is not significantly large .",
    "therefore , we suggest that these two stars have distinguishable excesses of mg from other metal - poor stars . it should be noted that @xcite and @xcite reported an excess of this element in cs  29497034 , although the mg abundance derived by their work is not as high as our present result ( see   [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "other stars with excesses of mg studied by previous work are lp  62544 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath126 ; aoki et al .",
    "2002a ) , cs  22949037 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath127 ; e.g. , depagne et al .",
    "2002 ) , and cs  29498043 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath128 ; e.g. , aoki et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the origin of the mg excesses in the latter two stars has been suggested to be `` faint supernovae '' explosions that ejected only a small amount of material surrounding the iron core @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sources of mg in other mg - enhanced cemp stars are still unknown .",
    "we note that lp  62544 , cs  22949037 , and cs  29498043 also exhibit large overabundances of oxygen ( see references above ) .",
    "for the two stars with mg excesses in our sample , no useful constraint on the oxygen abundance has been obtained at present .",
    "measurements of oxygen abundances for these stars , possibly from the triplet lines at 7770   or near - infrared co lines , are strongly recommended .",
    "the na abundances of cemp stars exhibit a large range of enhancements . although some uncertainties arising from non - lte corrections and the treatment of damping exist in the determinations of na abundances , this large scatter can not be fully explained by measurement errors alone .",
    "previous evidence @xcite points to there being a slight increase in [ na / fe ] in more evolved , metal - poor red giants .",
    "the former work suggests values around [ na / fe ] = @xmath129 for field subgiants , [ na / fe ] = @xmath130 for field giants , and possibly higher values in globular - cluster giants .",
    "many ba - enhanced cemp stars deviate in their sodium abundances from the solar ratios . in order to investigate the correlation between the excesses of carbon and na , we show [ na / fe ] as a function of [ ( c+n ) /fe ] in figure [ fig : cnna ] . in this figure ,",
    "ba - enhanced and ba - normal cemp stars are shown by filled and open symbols , respectively .",
    "a clear correlation is found for the 14 ba - enhanced stars in our sample ( filled circles ) for which c , n , and na abundances are determined ( as confirmed by the rank correlation test at the 99% confidence level ) , while the correlation is weaker for the full sample of ba - enhanced objects .",
    "we can at least conclude that na - enhanced stars also have high [ ( c+n)/fe ] values .",
    "the mg - enhanced stars cs  29497034 and cs  29528028 exhibit very large enhancements of na ( [ na / fe ] = + 2.74 and + 1.78 , respectively ) .",
    "the iron abundances of these two stars are very low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath131 ) while their excesses of c , n , and ba are very high , as compared to the rest of our sample .",
    "these two stars can be regarded as extreme cases of the ba - enhanced cemp stars .",
    "sodium abundances have also been determined for seven ba - normal cemp stars in the present sample ( in addition to these stars , he  01075240 and he  13272326 , the objects having [ fe / h]@xmath132 , and the dwarf carbon star g77 - 61 , are also shown by open triangles in the figure ) .",
    "four stars among them do not deviate significantly from solar ratios , or have lower values .",
    "the carbon excess in these stars is moderate ( [ c / fe ] @xmath133 ) . this class of objects",
    "was first reported by @xcite , and possibly is a separate class from the other three ba - normal , extremely carbon - enhanced objects .",
    "the two ba - normal @xmath134-element - enhanced cemp stars , cs  22949037 and cs  29498043 , both have large enhancements of na .",
    "the other extremely carbon - rich cemp star , cs  22957027 , also exhibits a large excess of na .",
    "although the abundances of @xmath134-elements in cs  22957027 are normal , this star could be related in some manner to the above two @xmath134-element - enhanced objects .      as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the fraction of carbon - enhanced objects is significant at low metallicity , although the estimate of this fraction is dependent on the definition of carbon - enhanced stars and the methods used to identify them .",
    "for instance , @xcite have claimed that the fraction of cemp stars in a sample of giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath13 is 14.5 @xmath135% .",
    "lucatello et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based on high - resolution analyses of a much larger sample of stars , including many earlier - type stars than the cohen et al .",
    "sample , conclude that this fraction is at least 20 @xmath136% .",
    "an important question is what is ( are ) the origin(s ) of the carbon - enhancement in such objects .",
    "our results indicate that the majority of cemp stars are ba - enhanced objects  the fraction of ba - enhanced objects is more than 80% in our sample .",
    "this trend is particularly remarkable for stars with relatively high metallicity , above [ fe / h ] @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , our conclusion is that the large fraction of cemp stars at low metallicity can be principally attributed to the high efficiency of agb nucleosynthesis followed by the mass transfer to a surviving companion @xcite .    at the lowest metallicities",
    ", the contribution of ba - normal stars to the population of cemp stars becomes large .",
    "this is another factor that leads to the increased fraction of carbon - enhanced stars at low metallicity .",
    "the most extreme cases are the carbon - enhanced hyper metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath137 he  13272326 @xcite and he  01075240 @xcite , for which only upper limits of ba are determined .    given the wide distribution of carbon abundances among cemp stars , as well as the unique abundance patterns of several stars in this class , the cemp population of stars almost certainly comprises several astrophysical origins .",
    "no well - established model exists to explain the ba - normal cemp stars , although @xcite suggested that they form from carbon - rich gas ( from a massive progenitor - star population ) in contrast to the agb progenitor paradigm , which explains many features of ba - enhanced objects .",
    "for the two stars cs  22949037 and cs  29498043 , large excesses of the @xmath134-elements and oxygen are also found , suggesting the contribution of `` faint supernova '' nucleosynthesis , with the progenitor stars undergoing mixing and fallback @xcite .",
    "a similar interpretation might be applicable to the hyper metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath138 ( see also iwamoto et al .",
    "2005 ) , although several other models have been proposed for these stars .",
    "one idea is that such stars might have formed from gas polluted by mass loss from early - generation massive , rapidly - rotating stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "this model has the additional advantage of being able to account for the otherwise mysterious lack of detected li in the turnoff star he  13272326 @xcite .",
    "piau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have argued that this same population might even be responsible for the alteration of primordial li from ( higher ) big bang nucleosynthesis values down to a level consistent with the spite plateau li abundance found in metal - poor turnoff stars .",
    "if a significant population of such primordial objects did indeed exist , one might argue that they could be closely related to the astrophysical origin of the ba - normal cemp stars found at quite low metallicity .",
    "karlsson ( 2006 ) has appealed to the same progenitors to account for the possible gap in the metallicity distribution of halo stars between [ fe / h ] @xmath140 and @xmath141 revealed by the hk and he s prism surveys . also of interest",
    "is the recent paper by chiappini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where their new chemical evolution models _ require _ the large yields of carbon and nitrogen from the models discussed by @xcite in order to account for the upturn of the observed [ n / o ] and [ c / o ] ratios in the `` unmixed '' carbon-_normal _ stars described by spite et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "other possibilities for the origin of ba - normal cemp stars , in particular for the objects having normal abundance ratios of the @xmath134-elements , exist .",
    "@xcite suggested that one possible interpretation could be that the s - process in agb stars with such low metallicities did not produce any distinctive excess of barium . @xcite",
    "have recently proposed that the ba - normal cemp stars are the result of nucleosynthesis in extremely metal - poor agb stars with masses higher than 3.5  m@xmath69 .",
    "their models of agb stars , originally developed by @xcite , suggest that the s - process does not occur in extremely metal - poor agb stars in this mass range because of the low efficiency of radiative @xmath11c burning ( the case iv in their classification ) .",
    "interestingly , according to their models , this class of agb stars should have metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath142 , which is very similar to the metallicity range over which ba - normal cemp stars are found (  [ sec : ba ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no evidence of binarity for most objects in this class .",
    "however , according to their models , binary systems having very long orbital periods are able to produce carbon - enhancement by stellar winds from a primary agb star at very low metallicity . for such long - period binary systems ,",
    "the present absence of variations in radial velocity is not conclusive . a statistical analysis ( e.g. , lucatello et al .",
    "2005 ) based on large samples of ba - normal cemp stars observed over very long temporal baselines will be required in order to test such models .",
    "in this paper we have determined chemical abundances for 26 metal - poor stars , and classified 22 stars among them as carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , based on a new definition for the carbon - enhancement phenomenon including the effects of evolution along the giant branch on observed carbon abundances .",
    "sodium abundances were determined for another nine cemp stars for which abundances of other elements were previously studied . combining the results of previous work for 42 cemp stars and the 22 other cemp stars in our present sample , we investigated the abundance trends found in cemp stars and discussed the origins of carbon excesses in these objects .",
    "we found that most cemp stars ( more than 80% ) exhibit excesses of neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , ba ) , suggesting significant contributions of agb nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , the fraction of ba - normal stars increases at lower metallicity .",
    "the difference in the metallicity distribution of ba - enhanced and ba - normal cemp stars found in the present work should be a key to understanding the processes responsible for the ba - normal cemp stars .",
    "another difference between the ba - enhanced and ba - normal stars is found in their carbon abundance distributions . while the ba - enhanced stars have quite high carbon abundances ( @xmath143 [ c / h ] @xmath144 ) , independent of their metallicity , the [ c / h ] values of ba - normal cemp stars distribute over a wide range , while their average value is relatively low .",
    "this difference also suggests that the processes responsible for the ba - normal cemp stars are quite different from the agb nucleosynthesis that can explain the chemical abundances of ba - enhanced cemp stars .",
    "some possible interpretations are proposed for the origin of ba - normal cemp stars , in particular for the @xmath134-element - enhanced stars . moreover , these stars are likely to be closely related to the two known hyper metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] below @xmath145 . however , the sample of such stars studied with high - resolution spectroscopy is still quite small ( ten objects in the present sample ) .",
    "further observations for this class of objects are strongly recommended .",
    "measurements of abundances for ba - enhanced cemp stars based on high - resolution spectroscopy have been rapidly increasing in recent years .",
    "although the abundances of these objects are usually interpreted within the paradigm of agb nucleosynthesis and mass transfer in binary systems , their detailed abundance patterns are not well explained by current models .",
    "one example is the abundance pattern found for objects with very large excesses of neutron - capture elements , which can not be explained by the present agb models .",
    "several cemp stars are known to have enhancements of both r- and s - process elements , the so - called cemp - r / s stars .",
