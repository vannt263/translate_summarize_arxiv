    "the primary setting of descriptive set theory , including the study of borel and hausdorff hierarchies , is that of polish spaces . these are spaces homeomorphic to complete metric spaces that have a countable dense subset , for example the cantor space , the baire space , the real line and its intervals .",
    "the question of what parts of classical descriptive set theory still hold for spaces , specifically for general @xmath0 topological spaces , has not been yet systematically studied .",
    "major progress has been done by victor selivanov in his investigations centered mainly in algebraic domains ( directed complete partial orders with a countable base of compact elements ) in an ongoing series of papers on this topic that started in 1978 .",
    "recently , matthew de brecht ( 2011 ) presented the theory of _ quasi - polish _ spaces , a unifying framework for polish spaces and countably based domains ( i.e. , @xmath3-continuous domains , or directed complete partial orders with a countable basis ) .",
    "de  brecht characterized quasi - polish spaces in terms of the choquet topological games , and he proved that descriptive set theory can be nicely developed in such spaces .    in this paper",
    "we consider alternative unifying topological spaces , that we call _ approximation spaces_. not only they contain all polish spaces and all continuous domains , but a natural subclass of approximation spaces coincides with the class of quasi - polish spaces .",
    "approximation spaces can be viewed as the   la domain \" version of the   la polish \" unifying framework of de brecht .",
    "these spaces can also be characterized in terms of choquet games .",
    "we study the borel and hausdorff difference hierarchies in approximation spaces , revisiting the work done for the other topological spaces .",
    "we also consider the problem of effectivization of these results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . ",
    "[ s : preliminary ] presents the preliminary material .",
    "we recall the needed notions about the borel and hausdorff hierarchies in a @xmath0 ( possibly not @xmath2 ) topological context .",
    "we give an overview of the needed material on domains with the scott topology and quasi - polish spaces .",
    "we also present some prerequisites on the banach - mazur and choquet topological games .    ",
    "[ s : app ] is devoted to the class of approximation spaces .",
    "we prove that both , polish spaces and continuous domains , are approximation spaces .",
    "indeed , we show that all quasi - polish spaces are approximation spaces .",
    "theorem  [ thm : approx games ] characterizes approximation spaces in terms of choquet games .",
    "theorem  [ thm : coincide ] proves that quasi - polish spaces and _ convergent approximation spaces _ are the same class .    in the context of polish spaces ,",
    "the baire property asserts that any countable intersection of dense open sets is dense .",
    "thus , countable intersections of open sets , the @xmath4 sets , constitute the @xmath5 level of the borel hierarchy . in the context of @xmath0 but not @xmath2 spaces",
    "this is not true any more : the @xmath5 level consists of countable intersections of _ boolean combinations _ of open sets .",
    "then it is natural to consider the @xmath5 baire property which asserts that any countable intersection of dense differences of open sets is dense .",
    "as shown by de brecht ( 2011 ) , the usual @xmath4 baire property and hausdorff - kuratowski s theorem both hold for quasi - polish spaces .",
    "consequently , these two results are ensured for convergent approximation spaces .",
    "theorem [ thm : pi2 baire ] proves that , in fact , all approximation spaces satisfy the @xmath5 baire property .",
    "theorem [ thm : hausdorff ] extends hausdorff s theorem to spaces having a countable basis and such that every closed subspace is an approximation space : the @xmath6 class coincides with the difference hierarchy .",
    "this result was previously obtained by selivanov for @xmath3-algebraic domains and then for @xmath3-continuous domains ( selivanov 2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "de brecht ( 2011 ) proved that the full hausdorff - kuratowski theorem holds for quasi - polish spaces ; hence , it holds for convergent approximation spaces",
    ". we do not know whether it holds for all approximation spaces .",
    "in  [ s : hausdorff domains ] we revisit a part of selivanov s work ( 2005 , 2008 ) on domains that does not apply to polish spaces : his characterization of the classes of the hausdorff hierarchy in terms of alternating trees , and his proof of non existence of ambiguous sets in this hierarchy .",
    "we check that the assumption of @xmath3-algebraicity or @xmath3-continuity can be replaced , mutatis mutandis , by that of continuity .    ",
    "[ s : effective hierarchies ] is devoted to effectivization .",
    "the definition of approximation spaces admits a straightforward definition of an effective version .",
    "we make the first steps in developing the effective theory .",
    "we first recall the notions of effective topological space and effective domains .",
    "we also include the known machinery of effective borel codes .",
    "thorem  [ thm : hausdorff effective ] proves a weak effective version of hausdorff s theorem in effective approximation spaces .",
    "we obtain this proof as an adaptation of selivanov s work ( 2003 ) for the baire space .",
    "a general effective version of hausdorff s theorem is still an open question .",
