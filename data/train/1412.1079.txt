    "the unease of understanding quantum theory ( qt ) began at the very beginning of its establishment .",
    "the famous bohr - einstein debate @xcite inspired a lively controversy on quantum foundations .",
    "qt is surely an empirically successful theory , with huge applications ranging from subatomic world to cosmology .",
    "however , why does it attract such a heated debate over its whole history ?",
    "the controversial issues on quantum foundations mainly focus on two aspects : ( @xmath0 ) what does a wave function ( or a quantum state ) really mean ? ( @xmath1 ) is the so - called quantum measurement problem @xcite really a problem ? the first axiom of the standard qt states that a system s wave function provides a complete description of the system . but accepting the wave function as qt s central entity , what is the physical meaning of the wave function itself ? in this regard , there are two alternatives that the quantum state might be either a state about an experimenter s knowledge or information about some aspect of reality ( an epistemic  viewpoint ) , or a state of physical reality ( an ontic  viewpoint ) .",
    "a recent result @xcite on this issue seems to support the reality of quantum states , yet with ongoing controversy @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum measurement problem is perhaps the most controversial one on quantum foundations . according to the orthodox interpretation ( namely , the copenhagen interpretation @xcite ) of qt , a quantum system in a superposition of different states evolves deterministically according to the schrdinger equation , but actual measurements always collapse , in a truly random way , the system into a definite state , with a probability determined by the probability amplitude according to the born rule .",
    "when , where , and how the quantum state really collapses are out of the reach of qt as it is either uninteresting or unscientific to discuss reality before measurement  @xcite .",
    "our classical world view implies that there exists a world that is objective and independent of any observations . by sharp contrast , what is observed on a quantum system is dependent upon the choice of experimental arrangements ; mutually exclusive ( or complementary ) properties can not be measured accurately at the same time , a fact known as the complementarity principle .",
    "in particular , which type of measurements one would like to choose is totally a _",
    "free will _",
    "@xcite or a _ freedom of choice _ @xcite .",
    "such a freedom of choice underlies the pusey - barrett - rudolph theorem @xcite and the derivation of bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , one could ask : what does a free will or a freedom of choice really mean and whose free will or freedom of choice ?",
    "thus , in the orthodox interpretation classical concepts are necessary for the description of measurements ( which type of measurements to choose and the particular measurement results for chosen measurement ) in qt , although the measurement apparatus can indeed be described quantum mechanically , as done by von neumann @xcite . seen from its very structure , quantum mechanics contains classical mechanics as a limiting case , yet at the same time it requires this limiting case for its own formulation  @xcite . in this sense current qt has a classical - quantum _ hybrid _ feature . at a cosmological scale , the orthodox interpretation rules out the possibility of assigning a wave function to the whole universe , as no external observer could exist to measure the universe .    facing with the interpretational difficulties , various interpretations on qt were proposed by many brilliant thoughts , such as the hidden - variable theory @xcite ( initiated by the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen paper @xcite questioning the completeness of qt ) , many - worlds interpretation @xcite , the relational interpretation @xcite , and the decoherence theory @xcite , to mention a few .",
    "thus , `` questions concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics have been picked over so thoroughly that little meat is left '' @xcite .",
    "the discovery of bell s inequalities @xcite ( recently questioned from the many - worlds interpretation @xcite ) and the emerging field of quantum information @xcite might be among a few exceptions .",
    "the recent development of quantum information science sparks the information - theoretical understanding of quantum formalism @xcite .",
    "inspired by the classical - quantum hybrid feature of current qt and the above - mentioned interpretational progresses , here we present an informationally - complete quantum theory ( icqt ) by removing any classical concepts in our description of nature .",
    "the icqt is based on the _ informational completeness principle _ :",
    "a quantum system s state provides an informationally - complete description of the system . in other words ,",
    "quantum states represent an informationally - complete code of any possible information that one might access .",
    "current qt is _ not _ informationally - complete and thus suffers from interpretational difficulties . after working out the informational completeness explicitly in our formalism , we show that informationally - complete physical systems are characterized by dual entanglement pattern , the emergent * * dual born rule and dual dynamics .",
    "the computational content of our theory is uncovered by defining an informationally - complete quantum computer with potential of outperforming conventional quantum computers .",
    "moreover , we consider the possible conceptual applications of our theory , hoping to shed new light on some existing problems in physics .",
    "the orthodox quantum measurement theory @xcite was proposed by von neumann and can be summarized as follows . for an unknown @xmath2-dimensional quantum state @xmath3 of a quantum system @xmath4 to be measured , a measurement apparatus ( a pointer ) @xmath5",
    "is coupled to the system via a unitary operator @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is system s observable whose eigenstate with respect to the eigenvalue @xmath8 reads @xmath9 , namely , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 is the momentum operator which shifts pointer s @xmath13-reading ( @xmath14=i$ ] ) . assuming that the pointer is initialized in a ready  state @xmath15 and expanding @xmath16 in terms of @xmath9 as @xmath17 , then the system and the apparatus are mapped into @xmath18 . to ideally measure @xmath7 , one has to assume that @xmath5 must have at least @xmath2 macroscopically distinguishable pointer  positions ( plus the ready position corresponding to @xmath19 ) , and the pointer state @xmath20 and the measured states @xmath9 have a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the above is the usual pre - measurement progress .",
    "the orthodox interpretation of the measurement can only predict the collapse of a definite state @xmath9 with a probability @xmath21 given by the probability amplitude @xmath22 ; the collapse occurs in a truly random way . for latter convenience ,",
    "we call ( @xmath23 ) as an observable pair .",
    "it is interesting to note that a factorizable structure of the measurement operation  @xmath6 was discovered in the context of the dynamical approach to the quantum measurement problem @xcite .    to avoid the quantum measurement problem",
    ", here we take a key step by assuming explicitly informational completeness , whose meaning will be clear below , in our formalism of describing nature . to this end ,",
    "starting from a separable state @xmath24 , we introduce the third system , called the programming system  ( @xmath25 ) hereafter .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 has @xmath26 dimensions spanned by @xmath26 orthogonal states , called programming states @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , where @xmath26 is to be determined by informational completeness .",
    "let us define a unitary programming operation @xmath29 which means that if @xmath25 is in @xmath30 , then do a unitary measurement operation @xmath31 on @xmath32 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath25 is prepared in an initial state @xmath33 . then the state of the whole system @xmath34 after the programming operation reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 encodes the programmed entanglement between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "for a given @xmath27 , the observable pair , denoted by ( @xmath37 ) , to be measured is determined by the schmidt form of @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 can also be written in a schmidt form with positive real coefficients @xcite .",
    "hereafter we suppose that the schmidt decomposition of @xmath40 has been done .",
    "now the key point of our formalism is to require that the programming system @xmath25 encodes all possible , namely , informationally complete , measurement operations that are allowed to act upon the @xmath32-system . to be informationally complete",
    ", all programmed measurement operations @xmath41 can at least achieve the measurements of a complete set of operators for @xmath4 ; for the @xmath2-dimensional system , the complete set has @xmath42  operators @xcite , i.e. , the minimal @xmath43 .",
    "note that informationally complete set of operators or measurement is also important for quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "another trick in the above discussion is that , to enable the informationally - complete programmed measurements , it seems that one needs @xmath26 different measurement apparatuses .",
    "hereafter we take a step further by dropping this specific measurement model by regarding the @xmath5-system as a single system with @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) dimensions . in this case",
    "we have @xmath46 .",
    "the step is necessary for seeking a model - independent and intrinsic description of the whole system @xmath34 .    to have an easy understanding of our informationally - complete description of physical systems , some remarks are necessary .",
    "first , we note that the third system is also included in other interpretations of qt , such as the many - worlds interpretation @xcite and the relational interpretation @xcite .",
    "however , the third system in our formalism plays a role that is dramatically different from those interpretations .",
    "actually , imposing informational completeness into our quantum description of nature distinguishes our theory from all previous interpretations of qt .",
    "second , the fact that @xmath38 , as entangled , can always be written in a schmidt form implies a symmetric role played by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , the role of @xmath25  is dramatically different from that of either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "but @xmath25 and the combined system @xmath32 play a symmetric role .",
    "we anticipate that such a feature could have profound consequences , particularly for the internal consistency of the theory .",
    "we will find that this is indeed the case when we consider the dynamics within the icqt .",
    "how to acquire information and which kind of information to acquire are two questions of paramount importance . according to the icqt",
    ", on one hand , the only way to acquire information is to interact ( i.e. , entangle ) the system @xmath4 and the apparatus @xmath5 with each other ; no interaction leads to no entanglement and thus no information .",
    "this is in a similar spirit as the relational interpretation @xcite , which treats the quantum state as being observer - dependent , namely , the state is the relation between the observer and the system . on the other hand",
    ", the programming system @xmath25 , by interacting with @xmath32 , dictates the way ( actually , the informational - complete way ) on which kind of information to acquire about the system @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , if the whole system is programmed to measure @xmath47 , then @xmath4 and @xmath5 interact with each other to induce the programmed measurement operations @xmath31 .",
    "this process generates the entangled state @xmath38 with which @xmath5 knows , in a completely coherent way , all information about @xmath4 in the basis of @xmath47 ; the amount of entanglement contained in @xmath38 quantifies the amount of information acquired during this measurement .",
    "also , @xmath25 knows , also in a completely coherent way , the information about which kind of information ( here @xmath38 ) @xmath5 has about @xmath4 ; the amount of the @xmath25-@xmath48 entanglement quantifies the amount of information on which kind of measurements to do .",
    "all information is coherently and completely encoded there .",
    "note that information here is characterized by _ dual _ _",
    "entanglement_the @xmath25-@xmath48 entanglement ( maximally , @xmath49 ) and the @xmath4-@xmath5 entanglement ( maximally , @xmath50 ) contained in @xmath51 . as both @xmath52 and @xmath39 are pure states , their entanglement is uniquely quantified by the usual entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "this immediately identifies each of the squared coefficients of their schmidt decompositions as a probability to reconcile with shannon s definition of entropy .",
    "put differently , in our informationally - complete description of physical systems , entanglement is all _ the _ information ; classical terms like probability arise in our description because of either our reliance on classical concept of information or an approximate and incomplete description to be shown below .",
    "the status of quantum states in the informational completeness formalism thus represents a complete reality of the whole system ( @xmath25 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) .",
    "such a reality picture is only possible by taking into account the informational completeness explicitly in our formalism .",
    "quantum states do exist in a world that is informational and objective .",
    "whatever an observation might be , they always encode information pertaining to that observation as programmed , without invoking observers or having to appeal to any mysterious mechanisms to account for wave function collapse ; there is simply no wave function collapse",
    ". here local quantum states ( i.e. , states for each of @xmath25 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) are all relative , but information encoded in dual entanglement is invariant under the changes of local bases .",
    "if one likes , the choice of local bases can be called a free will or freedom of choice , corresponding to certain gauge . yet",
    ", all physical predictions of the theory are encoded in dual entanglement and do not depend on the chosen gauge .    in certain sense ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath5 act like a quantum being  ( qubeing ) who holds coherently all the informationally - complete programmes on how to entangle @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in this way",
    ", the qubeing has all the information about @xmath4 .",
    "however , our human beings , unlike the qubeing , only have limited ability to acquire information , with limited precisions , limited degrees of freedom , limited information detection and storage , and so on ; or simply we are so used to and familiar with classical concepts on information and physical systems .",
    "for example , an experimenter , alice , would like to acquire information about @xmath16 .",
    "first of all , she has to _ decide _ which kind of information she would like to know . after making a decision",
    ", she needs then to _ observe _ ( that is , to interact with ) the apparatus readily entangled with @xmath4 . in principle , alice s decisions and observations are all physical processes which should be described quantum mechanically .",
    "nevertheless , alice is macroscopic , and has so many quantum degrees of freedom and limited ability ( lack of full knowledge of the entire system ) . in this case",
    ", she has to trace out  her quantum degrees of freedom involved in her decisions ( interaction with @xmath25 ) , leading to a mixed state @xmath53 .",
    "this state allows a probability interpretation about alice s freedom of choice : each of her decisions @xmath27 occurs with a probability of @xmath54 .",
    "as far as a particular choice @xmath27 has been made , again she has to trace out her quantum degrees of freedom involved in her observation ( interaction with @xmath5 ) .",
    "this then leads to the usual born rule about @xmath16 for the given measurement .",
    "thus , in the icqt , the born rule is an emergent or derived rule determined by the dual entanglement structure .    to summarize the above picture , the world view of the icqt is fascinating .",
    "if we regard the system @xmath4 as an indivisible part of the qubeing @xmath55 , the whole system @xmath34 then represents an informationally complete and objective entity ; it seems that the qubeing has its own consciousness , a kind of miraculous quantum ability , to encode and access all its information in the form of dual entanglement , in which the constituent parts of the qubeing are mutually measured or defined . in other words , for the qubeing all information ( namely , all physical predictions ) is encoded in dual entanglement via interaction and not obtained via the usual quantum measurement with the unavoidable concept of the wave function collapse .",
    "the trinary picture ( the division of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 ) of physical systems arises here as a new feature of the icqt , as shown in figure 1 . to retain the informationally complete description of nature , such a trinary picture seems to be unavoidable .",
    "the limitation of informational contents in dual entanglement could be tentatively called the trinity principle , instead of the conventional complementarity principle , to put the trinary property of physical systems on the most fundamental ground .",
    "the loss of the trinary picture of describing physical systems leads to the _ emergent dual born rule _ ,",
    "i.e. , the probability description on which kind of observables to measure and on which eigenvalue of the observable to measure , due to , e.g. , lack of full knowledge of the entire system in our icqt .",
    "the conventional von neumann entropy quantifies this dual loss of information . in other words ,",
    "the conventional born rule arises as a consequence of the sacrifice of informationally - complete description in the trinary picture ; the sacrifice leads to a _ partial _ reality of physical system as described by conventional qt .    , measurement apparatus @xmath5 , and programming system @xmath25 naturally arises in the informationally complete description of physical systems .",
    "the taiji pattern  shows in an intuitive manner the @xmath4-@xmath5 interaction ( entanglement ) , while the green discs inside and outside the taiji pattern represent the programmed measurement operations @xmath56 between @xmath25 and @xmath32 . in ancient china , taoists regarded the taiji pattern as a diagram of the universe .",
    "the trinary picture of the world shown here is ubiquitous in the sense that the world , at the most fundamental level , is made up of a trinity : gravity ( @xmath25 ) , elementary particles ( @xmath4 ) and their gauge fields ( @xmath5 ) ; the trinity should be describable by the icqt . ]",
    "according to the above picture of nature , single free systems are simply meaningless for acquiring information and thus in the information - vacuum  state ; a system , which does not give information to ( i.e. , interact with ) other systems in any way , simply does not exist .",
    "the @xmath4+@xmath5  description in the usual qt is also inadequate because of its informational incompleteness .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the icqt has to obey the informational completeness principle within the trinary picture and thus will be dramatically different from the usual picture .",
    "namely , the icqt is characterized by the indivisibility of its kinematics and dynamics to maintain the informationally - complete trinary description .    before considering the informationally - complete dynamics ,",
    "let us introduce an important conception of _ dual _ _ measurability _ : the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability and the programmed @xmath57 measurability .",
    "the former means the ability of measuring @xmath25 with @xmath32 and vice versa ; the latter means the ability of measuring @xmath5 with @xmath4 and vice versa , under a given programmed measurement operation of @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability ( the programmed measurability @xmath57 ) leads to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) and thus a symmetric role between @xmath25 and @xmath32 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "note that here measurability does not means certain von neumann measurement actually performed by an experimenter .",
    "after the above preparation , now we give a definition of informationally - complete physical systems : a physical system is said to be informationally - complete if and only if ( the use of if and only if  will be explained below ) it is consisted of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath25 described as a trinity such that the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability and the programmed measurability @xmath57 are satisfied . as a result of this definition ,",
    "the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability implies the existence of at most @xmath60 independent _ informationally complete measurement ( entanglement ) operations _ in the hilbert spaces of both @xmath25 and @xmath32 ; these operations generate at most @xmath60-dimensional entangled states between @xmath25 and @xmath32 and at most @xmath60 entangled states between @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that @xmath25 and @xmath32 are mutually measuring and defining .",
    "meanwhile , under the given programming state of @xmath25 , the programmed measurability @xmath57 implies the existence of at most @xmath61-dimensional entangled states between @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mutually measuring and defining , as programmed . for convenience",
    ", we also call the complete set of states and operators defined in the hilbert space of @xmath25 or @xmath32 are informationally complete .",
    "accordingly , states and operators for either @xmath4 or @xmath5 alone are _ informationally incomplete_.    let us suppose that the informationally - complete system @xmath34 has a general hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "we assume that the whole system evolutes according to a schrdinger - like equation ( we take @xmath63 ) , namely , @xmath64 . in general , @xmath65 , where the subscripts label the corresponding systems .",
    "now our problem is to determine how the informational completeness principle constrains the form of @xmath62 and thus the dynamics of the @xmath34-system .",
    "note that we can choose an orthonormal basis ( the programming basis ) \\{@xmath66 } to span the whole hilbert space of @xmath25 .",
    "we associate each programming state @xmath67 as an eigenstate of @xmath25-system s programming observable  @xmath68 with eigenvalue @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the following hamiltonian obeys the informational completeness principle : @xmath70 if we impose the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability condition as follows @xmath71=0 , \\label{pmc}\\ ] ] namely , @xmath72 and @xmath73  are commutative .    in eq .",
    "( [ ipsa ] ) @xmath74 is an informationally - complete operator set of @xmath32 and as such , @xmath75 has also been included therein , up to local unitary tranformations .",
    "@xmath76 induces a dynamical evolution @xmath77 ; the evolution operator @xmath78 always has a factorizable structure @xmath79 as a result of the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability condition ( [ pmc ] ) , such that @xmath80 @xmath81 in this way , the dynamical evolutions of @xmath25 and @xmath32 are mutually defined , in accordance with the informational completeness principle .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath76 as given above respects the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability .",
    "if we also require the programmed measurability @xmath57 ( @xmath82 ) , the evolution governed by @xmath83 will similarly acquire the factorizable structure as @xmath84 + \\hat{h}_{\\mathcal{s}\\left\\vert _ { \\mathcal{p}}\\right .   }",

    "similarly to the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability condition ( [ pmc ] ) , we need to impose the programmed measurability @xmath57 condition @xmath90=0\\ \\ \\ \\ ( \\forall e_{n}).\\label{sapmc}\\ ] ] the @xmath57 dynamics is then similar to the @xmath25-@xmath32 dynamics considered above .",
    "such a _ dual dynamics _ of the whole system @xmath34 is an attribute of the trinary description and quite distinct to the usual schrdinger evolution .",
    "what is the physical significance of the programming basis \\{@xmath91 } and the associated observable @xmath68 ?",
    "actually it is physically transparent that \\{@xmath91 } can be identified with the schmidt basis for the @xmath25-@xmath32 decomposition , which is not affected by the local transformations generated by @xmath73 .",
    "when applying the icqt to quantum gravity @xcite , the usual schrdinger equation reduces to a constraint @xmath92 , known as the wheeler - dewitt equation . in this case",
    ", the programming observable @xmath68 then corresponds to a dirac observable @xcite .    to end this section ,",
    "it is important to note that the distinguished roles of @xmath25 and @xmath32 are relative .",
    "depending on the specific form of the trinary hamiltonian , we could have another possibility that @xmath32 can programme the evolution of @xmath25 . in this case",
    ", the programming basis is chosen for @xmath32 and associated with an observable being commutative with @xmath93 such that the @xmath25-@xmath32 measurability and a similar dynamics as in eq .",
    "( [ dual - dyn ] ) can still be obtained .",
    "furthermore , the roles of @xmath25 and @xmath32 are actually symmetric due to a nice property of the schmidt decomposition @xcite , in which if an orthonormal basis labelled by an index ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) is chosen for a system , then the orthonormal basis for another system , by acting a unitary tranformation upon it , is labelled by the same index .",
    "this property implies that both of the bases are already the schmidt bases , up to local unitary tranformations .",
    "a similar consideration is applicable to the programmed measurability @xmath57 , too .",
    "what is the relation between ( [ dual - dyn ] ) and the usual schrdinger equation ? here the dynamical evolution is such that systems @xmath25 and @xmath32 are mutually defined , and so systems @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in an informationally - complete quantum field theory ,",
    "if we regard @xmath4 as particle fields and @xmath5 as gauge fields , and @xmath32 together as matter fields , then we immediately recognize that system @xmath25 must be the gravitational field ( i.e. , spacetime ) , nothing else .",
    "if we think this way , an amazing picture ( figure 1 ) of our world arises : the gravitational field and matter fields are mutually defined and entangled  no matter , no gravity ( spacetime ) and vice versa , and for each of their entangled patterns , particle fields and their gauge fields are likewise mutually defined and entangled . if this is indeed what our nature works to obey the informational completeness principle , the conventional qt will be an approximation of our icqt when nature s programming system , i.e. , gravity , hides  its quantum effects .",
    "under such an approximation the icqt reduces to conventional qt , characterized by the usual schrdinger equation and the probability description and as such , qt in its current form is thus informationally incomplete .",
    "this is in the exact sense that classical newtonian mechanics is an approximate theory of special relativity when a physical system has a speed much less than the speed of light .    on the other hand ,",
    "no matter how weak gravity is , it is forced to be there by the informational completeness principle , to play a role for the internal consistency of the theory .",
    "this unique role of gravity ( or spacetime ) in our theory is consistent with the remarkable fact that only gravity is universally coupled to all other physical fields ( particle fields and gauge fields ) .",
    "of course , our current quantum description is an extremely good approximation .",
    "but for scales near the planck one and for early universe , quantized spacetime acts as the programming system and the icqt will be necessary .",
    "thus , both facts ( i.e. , current qt works so well and quantum gravity effects are so weak at normal scales ) hide so deeply any new theoretical architecture beyond current qt , like the icqt . even in the string theory , there is no change of the underlying quantum formalism .",
    "by contrast , what we suggest within the icqt is that at the level of quantized fields including quantized spacetime , everything is quantized and one does not have the usual separation of the quantum system and the observer . in this case",
    ", one has to give up the classical - quantum hybrid feature of current qt . for this purpose , the most obvious way seems to be the elimination of the measurement postulate in our fully quantum ( namely , not classical - quantum hybrid ) description of nature .",
    "as we hope to argue , giving up the classical concepts associated with the measurement postulate in current qt does not lead to any sacrifice of our predictive power as the complete information is encoded by the dual entanglement structure .",
    "if we take the above argument seriously , then _ the icqt captures the most remarkable trinity of nature _ ,",
    "namely , the division of nature by particles , their gauge fields and gravity ( spacetime ) , though the role of the higgs field needs a separate consideration .",
    "the previous two sections argued the necessity of the informational completeness in the trinary description .",
    "here we see that it is also sufficient : we do not have to invoke more programming systems to program @xmath34 simply because we do not have spacetime ( gravity ) out of spacetime ( gravity)trinity is necessary and sufficient .",
    "this eliminates the von neumann chain in the usual quantum measurement model .",
    "thus , the icqt gives a strong motivation or reason for quantizing spacetime .",
    "however , quantizing gravity as yet another field , as in concentional quantum field theory , is not sufficient and does not automatically result in a correct and consistent quantum theory of all known forces .",
    "only when the informational completeness in the trinary description is integrated into our quantum formulation , can we have the desired theory of the universe . only after that , can the relation between our theory and the conventional quantum theory be rigorously discussed .    as we showed elsewhere @xcite , following",
    "the above argument indeed leads to a consistent framework of unifying spacetime ( gravity ) and matter , without the fundamental inconsistencies @xcite between gravity and conventional quantum field theory , implying the conceptual advantages of our theory .",
    "for instance , with the theoretical input from loop quantum gravity predicting the quantized geometry @xcite , the informationally complete quantum field theory naturally gives the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "such a strong limit on the allowed states of the trinary system in any finite spacetime regime , as imposed by the icqt , paves the way to escape the infrared and ultraviolet singularities ( divergences ) that occur in conventional quantum field theory .",
    "the natural position of gravity in the icqt can not be accidental and may be a strong evidence supporting our informationally - complete description of nature .",
    "thus , at the most fundamental level , our reasoning suggests once again the trinary picture of our world consisting of particles , gauge fields and gravity as a trinity .",
    "it is surprise to see that nature singles out gravity as a programming field , which plays a role that is definitely different from matter fields .",
    "this also indicates the distinct roles of matter - matter ( particles and their gauge fields ) entanglement and spacetime - matter ( i.e. , gravity - matter ) entanglement and might explain the reason why quantizing gravity as usual quantized fields suffers from well - known conceptual problems .    as an abstract mathematical structure ,",
    "current qt is content - irrelevant in the following sense .",
    "while it is believed to be universally applicable to physical systems of any physical contents , ranging from elementary particles and ( super)strings to the whole universe , what physical content that it describes does not matter and the physical content never changes its very structure .",
    "the situation for classical mechanics is quite similar in this aspect .",
    "however , the icqt changes this in a dramatic way in the sense that the trinary picture of nature has to be integrated into a consistent formulation to enable an informationally - complete description .",
    "the physical content that the icqt describes does matter as the states and their dynamical evolution of the trinary system are constrained or structured into the dual forms specified above .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of the programming system , identified with gravity in the field - theoretical case , is very essential and necessary in our description .",
    "a new theory should make new predictions or / and motivate new applications .",
    "of course , previous interpretations of qt are very important for a better understanding of the theory .",
    "however , no interpretations make new predictions or / and motivate fundamentally new applications .",
    "now we argue that our icqt indeed motivates new applications if we consider its computational power .",
    "even though gravity would play certain role in our future understanding of nature , artificial informationally - complete quantum systems are realizable as a quite good approximation .    what is an informationally - complete quantum computer ( icqc ) ?",
    "we define the icqc as an artificial informationally - complete quantum systems , or a quantum intelligent system ( qubeing ) , which has an informationally - complete trinary structure consisting of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the icqc starts from an initial state @xmath95 . as usual",
    ", the @xmath4 system has @xmath94 qubits , and thus dimensions of @xmath96 . to be well defined",
    ", we also use qubits to make up the @xmath5 system and the @xmath25 system ; @xmath5 ( @xmath25 ) has @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) qubits and dimensions of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) . to satisfy the informational completeness principle , we have @xmath101  and @xmath102 .",
    "our icqc then works by applying certain patterns of universal quantum logic gates ( single - qubit and two - qubit ones ) , determined by quantum algorithm pertaining to the question under study . generally speaking , as an artificially controllable quantum system",
    "the patterns of gates are allowed to exhaust all unitary operations on the whole @xmath103 system , which we denote collectively by @xmath104 . at the end of running the icqt",
    ", we perform the programmed measurement operation @xmath56 on @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting final state of the icqc reads @xmath105 . here , @xmath106 and all @xmath107 span a complete operator set for @xmath32 .",
    "is the icqc defined above a usual quantum computer merely with more ( @xmath108 ) qubits , but without the informational - completeness and trinary structure ?",
    "the answer is definitely no  because of the conceptual difference between the two quantum computing devices . to see this",
    ", we prepare each qubit of @xmath4 in the initial state @xmath109 such that @xmath16 is in a superposition of all @xmath96 bit - values with equal probability amplitude : @xmath110 .",
    "the initial states of @xmath5 and @xmath25 are likewise prepared : @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "such a coherent superposition of conventional quantum computer s initial states is believed to be the very reason for the speedup of quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "now let us make a further simplification by doing nothing anymore on @xmath5 and @xmath4 , namely , the icqc only acts @xmath56 on the initial state as @xmath113    for such a simplified icqc , @xmath56 can encode all possible ( i.e. , informationally complete ) programmed measurement operations upon @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "these operations are actually all allowed quantum algorithms and their outputs on @xmath94-qubit state @xmath114 , in the terminology of conventional quantum computing .",
    "then we immediately see that in the icqc , one has _ dual parallelism _ : parallelism in initial states as usual _ and _ parallelism of programmed operations ( algorithms and outputs ) . in other words ,",
    "_ a single icqc with _ @xmath115",
    "_ qubits could compute in parallel all algorithms of usual quantum computers with _ @xmath94 _",
    "qubits_. due to this particular dual parallelism enabled by the icqc , it is reasonable to expect much higher computational power with the icqc .",
    "actually , the icqc is , by definition , the most powerful computational machine on qubit systems in the sense of informational completeness ; otherwise it is informationally incomplete . finding algorithms on the icqc to explicitly demonstrate the computational power of the icqc is surely a future interesting problem .",
    "also , computational complexity and error - tolerance in the icqc framework are two important issues .",
    "if nature does use the informational completeness as a guiding principle , it computes the world we currently know ; such a world could be simulated and thus comprehensible by the icqc ( i.e. , qubitization  within an informationally - complete trinary description ) in principle .",
    "below we give , only very briefly , a few conceptual applications of the informational completeness principle and the icqt , hoping to shed new light on some long - standing open questions in physics .",
    "an important question is how to understand the occurrence of the classical world surrounding us , including the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time , in our new framework characterized by the informational completeness principle and the trinary picture of nature .",
    "though we can not present quantitative analysis of the problem here , a qualitative and conceptual answer to the problem is quite transparent : for informationally complete quantum systems , always - on interactions lead to the increase of entanglement for @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath25-@xmath32 systems ; the universe as a whole has an increasing entanglement , a kind of _ entanglement arrow of time_. it is easy to verify the entanglement creation by considering the @xmath34 evolution governed by @xmath76 from a separable state . at a thermodynamic / macroscopic scale , tracing out thermodynamically / macroscopically irrelevant degrees of freedom , only as an approximate description of the underlying informationally complete physics , leads to the second law of thermodynamics , the arrow of time , and ultimately , the classical world .",
    "we note related analysis on the role of entanglement in the thermodynamic arrow of time in the framework of conventional @xcite or time - neutral formulation @xcite of quantum mechanics .",
    "as gravity arguably plays an essential role in our informationally complete description of nature , it is intriguing to see that gravity plays some role in the occurrence of the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time , as hinted in the study of black - hole thermodynamics @xcite . in the disi - penrose model @xcite ,",
    "gravity was argued to play certain role for the wave function collapse .",
    "now let us briefly consider the potential conceptual applications to cosmology .",
    "obviously , the conceptual difficulty of applying usual qt to the whole universe disappears in our icqt .",
    "actually , the icqt is interpretation - free and does not need an observer as the observer is a part of the universe ; the description of the universe by the icqt would give us all information as it could be .",
    "the contituent parts in trinity are mutually defining and measuring in a specific dual entanglement structure , eliminating any subjective aspects regarding the current interpretations of quantum states  the existence of the universe does not rely on the existence of potential observers observing the universe .",
    "their entanglement in the dual form encodes , without relying on any external observers , all physical information and can give all physical predictions of the theory .",
    "there is no reason why we can not describe our human beings as an informationally complete ( classical , but ultimately , quantum ) system via a trinary description . in this way",
    ", some aspects of human beings could be comprehensible purely from the informational and physical point of view .",
    "for instance , if we define alice s body and all of her sense organs as @xmath5 and her outside world as @xmath4 , then alice knows her world or gets known by her world via interaction ( i.e. , information exchange ) between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "now an intriguing problem arises here : what is the programming system @xmath25 in this context ?",
    "a straightforward way is simply to define @xmath25 ( or , the correlations between @xmath25 and @xmath32 ) as the mind ( consciousness ) . by analogy to the above quantum trinary description , the mind @xmath25 and @xmath32 are mutually defined in an informationally - complete sense .",
    "this prescription thus provides an interesting possibility of understanding the most mysterious part ( namely , consciousness ) of human beings from an informational and physical perspective .",
    "particularly , alice s brain undertakes only _ partial _ ( though the most important ) functioning of her mind according to the above definition ; the remaining functioning of her mind is distributed nonlocally in such a way that enables programming the interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that , in an informationally - complete field theory @xcite , the programming system is the quantized spacetime . if we take the above analogy more seriously , a very strange conclusion seems to be unavoidable : alice s mind @xmath25 should be ultimately explainable by the spacetime @xmath25 , namely , the mind is certain spacetime code of alice s @xmath32 .",
    "the reason behind the conjecture is the strong belief that the informational completeness should underlie the world , ranging from the elementary trinity ( elementary fermions , their gauge fields , and spacetime ) to our human beings and the whole universe  actually , everything in the world is built from the informationally - complete elementary trinity .    in certain sense",
    ", it seems that human beings work as a quantum - decohering icqc .",
    "similarly to the fact that an icqc is conceptually different from a normal quantum computer , a classical computing device with an integrated trinary structure similar to the icqc should be quite different from the normal turing machine and could be capable of simulating human - like intelligence better .",
    "does this mean certain `` consciousness computing '' , or `` intelligence computing '' ?",
    "further consideration in the context will be given in future .",
    "therefore , it could well be that the informational completeness is of significance in a broader sense and should be a basic requirement for any physical systems , classical or quantum .",
    "it is in this sense that the informational completeness deserves to be named as a principle .",
    "it is a missed principle in our current understanding of nature and a rule behind the comprehensibility of the world ",
    "the informationally complete world is comprehensible by informationally complete human beings .",
    "in the present work , we have presented an interpretation - free qt under the assumption that quantum states of physical systems represent an informationally - complete code of any possible information that one might access . to make the informational completeness explicitly in our formalism",
    ", the trinary picture of describing physical systems seems to be necessary .",
    "physical systems in trinity evaluate and are entangled both in a dual form ; quantum entanglement plays a central role in the icqt  our world is information given in terms of entanglement at the most fundamental level .",
    "so _ the icqt modifies two postulates ( on quantum states and on dynamics ) of current quantum mechanics in a fundamental way and eliminates the measurement postulate from our description_. we give various evidences and conceptual applications of the icqt , to argue that the icqt , naturally identifying gravity as nature s programming system , might be a candidate theory capable of unifying matter and gravity ( spacetime ) in an informationally complete quantum framework ; for further development on our theory in the context of quantum gravity , see ref .  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the conventional qt will be an approximation of our icqt when quantum effect of gravity is ignored or unimportant .",
    "such an approximation leads to the approximate schrdinger equation and the probability description of current qt .",
    "this is in the exact sense that classical newtonian mechanics is an approximate description of relativistic systems .",
    "the icqt motivates an interesting application to informationally - complete quantum computing .    as we argued above , current quantum mechanics",
    "is _ not _ informationally - complete and thus suffers from interpretational difficulties .",
    "the explicit demand of informational completeness not only removes the conceptual problem of our current understanding of quantum mechanics , but also leads to a profound constraint on formulating quantum theory .",
    "thus , the icqt should not be understood simply as another interpretation of current qt ; rather , it , by giving up the classical concept of probability associated with the measurement postulate , generalizes current quantum formalism  the physical prediction ( outcomes of an observable and the corresponding probabilities ) of a quantum measurement in conventional qt is now entailed by entanglement ; no entanglement implies no information and thus no prediction . as we noted previously , adding informational completeness requirement into our current quantum formalism leads to serious consequences : informational completeness not only restricts the way on how to describe physical systems , but also the way how they interact / entangle with each other .",
    "this will thus give a very strong constraint on what physical progresses could have happened or be allowed to happen .",
    "on one hand , the icqt provides a coherent conceptual picture of , or sheds new light on , understanding some problems or phenomena in current physics , including the intrinsic trinity of particles , gauge fields and gravity , the occurrence of the classical world , the arrow of time , and the holographic principle . on the other hand ,",
    "some other problems , such as the complementarity principle , quantum nonlocality @xcite and quantum communication , should be reconsidered from the viewpoint of the icqt .",
    "all current quantum communication protocols @xcite have to make use of classical concepts on information .",
    "it is thus very interesting to see how to do communication in the icqt and , particularly , to see whether or not it is possible to achieve unconditionally secure communication .    according to the icqt , the world underlying us",
    "is all about information ( entanglement ) ; it is informationally complete , deterministic , self - defining , and thus objective .",
    "such a world view ( quantum determinism ) is of course quite different from what we learn from current quantum mechanics , but in some sense , returns to einstein s world view and not surprisingly , represents an embodiment of wheeler s thesis known as it from bit  @xcite .",
    "such a viewpoint calls for a reconsideration of our current understanding on physical reality , information , spacetime ( gravity ) and matter , as well as their links .",
    "let us cite the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen paper @xcite here : _ while we have thus shown the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality , we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists .",
    "we believe , however , that such a theory is possible_.  it is too early to judge whether or not our icqt completes current quantum mechanics in the einstein - podolsky - rosen sense as experiments will be the ultimate judgement .",
    "but if nature does work like a description provided by the icqt , nature will be very funny and more importantly , nature does be comprehensible .    * * acknowledgements**i am grateful to chang - pu sun for bringing ref .",
