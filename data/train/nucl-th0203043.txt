    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is a fundamental relationship in open system problems such as the brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the most famous one is the einstein relation , which connects the diffusion coefficient to the friction coefficient with the temperature as the proportional coefficient .",
    "this relationship can be easily derived if the bare potential for the brownian particle , or more generally the collective motion , is flat and if the environment can be approximated by a canonical distribution .",
    "it has to be modified if the quantum fluctuation becomes comparable to the thermal fluctuation .",
    "when the bare potential for the collective motion is a parabolic well , the modified formula is well known .",
    "it resembles the original einstein relation , in which temperature is replaced by an effective temperature @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature converges to the genuine temperature when the thermal energy dominates the quantal zero point motion energy of the collective motion , and it converges to the zero point motion energy in the opposite limit .",
    "however , there exist only a few investigations when the bare potential of the collective motion is not a potential well but a potential barrier @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address to this question . following the standard treatment for deriving the fluctuation - dissipation relation for motion in a potental well , we investigate the connection between moments of the response and the correlation functions for the motion along a potential barrier .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this study is important in various problems .",
    "one of the examples is the stability of nuclear collective excitation @xcite .",
    "another example is the fusion between two very heavy nuclei , which is used to try to synthesize superheavy elements . in this case",
    ", the fission barrier locates inside the fusion barrier .",
    "consequently , it is not sufficient to overcome the fusion barrier in order for the two nuclei to fuse .",
    "they have to overcome also the fission barrier .",
    "one possible theoretical approach to this problem is to apply the fokker planck equation , which has been originally put forward by kramers @xcite to describe nuclear fission and chemical reactions , to describing the time evolution from the fusion point to the region inside the fission barrier .",
    "though several pioneering works in this method have already been published @xcite , it is not obvious whether one can apply the original fokker planck equation of kramers as it is .",
    "for example , it is required to synthesize superheavy elements at temperatures as low as possible in order to sustain the shell correction energy which yields the barrier against fission by quantum effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature of the fission barrier is of the order of 1 mev .",
    "one will then need to care about the quantum fluctuation . in this connection , it is highly desirable to generalize the original fokker planck equation by kramers by taking quantum fluctuation into accont for the diffusion process along a potential barrier .",
    "the formalism presented here provides a first step in this direction . following a weak - coupling treatment ,",
    "we derive a generalized fokker - planck equation which incorporates quantum statistical effects in terms of non - markovian transport coefficients .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we sketch the basic ideas of our theory to describe the time evolution of coupled collective and microscopic motions .",
    "it is a generalization of the quasi linear response theory in ref .",
    "@xcite to include a quantum effect of the collective motion .",
    "we thus derive the generalized fokker - planck equation for the collective motion with non - markovian transport coefficients . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the properties of the force exerted by the microscopic motion , which we sometimes call the bath space , to determine the average classical trajectory of the collective motion . in section iv , we represent the response and the correlation functions in terms of the spectral functions @xcite , and discuss their symmetry properties . in section",
    "v , we discuss the memory times of the response and the correlation functions . in order to have some concrete ideas , we resort to the caldeira - leggett model @xcite to this end . section vi deals with the collective motion in a flat potential or in a parabolic well and derives the well known fluctuation dissipation relation including the effect of quantum fluctuation . in sect.vii",
    "we consider the case of ohmic dissipation of the caldeira - leggett model , and give the explicit expressions of the odd moment of the response function and the even moment of the correlation function for the motion in a potential well and the odd moment of the response function for the motion along a potential barrier . in sect.viii",
    "we study the properties of the even moment of the correlation function for the collective motion along a parabolic potential barrier by taking the case of the ohmic dissipation of the caldeira - leggett model with a cut - off function as an example .",
    "we show the strong time dependence of the even moment of the correlation function and show that the asymptotic value as the time goes to infinity converges to a classical expectation value at high temperatures , but significantly deviates from it at low temperatures .",
    "we summarize the paper in sect .",
    "ix . appendix a gives the main steps of the perturbation treatment of the coupled von - neumann equations for the collective and microscopic motions and show how the reduced von - neumann equation with non - markovian transport coefficients is obtained .",
    "appendix b is added to briefly sketch the symmetry property of the spectral function which is useful to derive the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "appendix c collects some basic formulae and the spectral function of the caldeira - legget model . in appendix",
    "d we present a general expression of the m - th moment of the response function for the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "we give an explicit expression of the linear friction for the case of ohmic dissipation .",
    "also we show that the linear friction is absent in the case of the super - ohmic dissipation , and that the leading order is the n - th oder friction if the spectral density is proportional to @xmath0 .",

    "figure 4 shows the memory time as a function of the temperature for three values of the cut - off frequency .",
    "these results show that the memory time is nearly independent of temperature t and the cut - off frequency @xmath137 provided @xmath138 mev , and its magnitude is around @xmath139 second . consequently , when the temperature is comparable or even lower than the energy of the quantum zero point motion , a sufficiently large cut - off frequency guarantees a short memory time even at such low temperatures .",
    "we are now ready to derive the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the case , where @xmath140 , i.e. for the diffusion process in a flat potential or in a potential well .",
