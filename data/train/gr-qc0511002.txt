    "a  quantization of a four - simplex for the riemannian general relativity was proposed by barrett and crane @xcite .",
    "it was built on the idea of the barrett - crane intertwiner .",
    "it was shown by reisenberger @xcite that the barrett - crane intertwiner is the unique solution to the barrett - crane constraints corresponding a tetrahedron ( except for the non - degeneracy condition ) .",
    "here i would i  like to present an alternative proof of uniqueness by systematically deriving the barrett - crane intertwiner by imposing the barrett - crane constraints .",
    "the bivectors @xmath1 associated with the ten triangles of a four - simplex in a flat riemannian space satisfy the following properties called the barrett - crane constraints @xcite :    1 .",
    "the bivector changes sign if the orientation of the triangle is changed .",
    "each bivector is simple .",
    "if two triangles share a common edge , then the sum of the bivectors is also simple .",
    "the sum of the bivectors corresponding to the edges of any tetrahedron is zero .",
    "this sum is calculated taking into account the orientations of the bivectors with respect to the tetrahedron .",
    "the six bivectors of a four - simplex sharing the same vertex are linearly independent .",
    "the volume of a tetrahedron calculated from the bivectors is real and non - zero .    the items two and three can be summarized as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the @xmath4 represents the triangles of a tetrahedron . if @xmath5 , it is referred to as the simplicity constraint . if @xmath6 it is referred as the cross - simplicity constraints .    barrett and crane have shown @xcite that these constraints are sufficient to restrict a general set of ten bivectors @xmath7 so that they correspond to the triangles of a geometric four - simplex up to translations and rotations in a four dimensional flat riemannian space .",
    "a quantum four - simplex for riemannian general relativity is defined by quantizing the barrett - crane constraints @xcite .",
    "the bivectors @xmath1 are promoted to the lie operators @xmath8 on the representation space of the relevant group and the barrett - crane constraints are imposed at the quantum level .",
    "the last two constraints are inequalities and they are difficult to impose . for these reasons here after i  would like to refer to a state sum model that satisfies only the first four constraints as an _ essential barrett - crane model _ , while a state sum model that satisfies all the six constraints as a _ rigorous barrett - crane model_. the barrett - crane intertwiner corresponds to essential barrett - crane model only .",
    "we will do a systematic derivation of the essential barrett - crane model here .",
    "our treatment of the simplicity constraints is basically a review of work done before @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath9 is isomorphic to @xmath10 .",
    "an element @xmath11 of the lie algebra of @xmath12 can be split into the left and the right handed @xmath13 components,@xmath14 there are two casimir operators for @xmath12 which are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the flat euclidean metric . in terms of the left and right handed split i can expand the casimir operators as@xmath17@xmath18 where the dot products are the trace in the @xmath13 lie algebra coordinates .",
    "the bivectors are to be quantized by promoting the lie algebra vectors to lie operators on the unitary representation space of @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "the relevant unitary representations of @xmath12 are labeled by a pair ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) of unitary representations of @xmath13 .",
    "the elements of the representation space @xmath23 @xmath24 are the eigen states of the casimirs and on them the operators reduce to the following : @xmath25@xmath26 the equation ( [ eq.1 ] ) implies that on @xmath23 @xmath24 the simplicity constraint @xmath27 is equivalent to the condition @xmath28 .",
    "i would like to find a representation space on which the representations of @xmath12 are restricted precisely by @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath22 .    in ref:@xcite",
    "it has been shown for @xmath31 that the simplicity constraint reduces the hilbert space associated to a triangle to that of the @xmath32 functions on @xmath33 .",
    "consider a square integrable function @xmath34 @xmath35 on the sphere @xmath36 defined by @xmath37 it can be fourier expanded in the representation matrices of @xmath13 using the isomorphism @xmath38 @xmath13,@xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 is an isomorphism from @xmath36 to @xmath42 @xmath43 the fourier coefficients , @xmath44 are the matrix elements of spin @xmath45 representation of an element @xmath46 and @xmath47 the dimension of the @xmath45 representation",
    ". the group action of @xmath48 on @xmath49 @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 using equation ( [ cs3exp ] ) i can consider the @xmath52 as the basis functions of @xmath32 functions on @xmath53 the matrix elements of the action of @xmath54 on @xmath36 is given by@xmath55 i see that the representation matrices are precisely those of @xmath12 only restricted by the constraint @xmath28 . since we have all the simple representations included in the representation",
    ", the simplicity constraint effectively reduces the hilbert space @xmath56 to the space of @xmath32 functions on @xmath36 .",
    "next let me quantize the cross - simplicity constraint part of the barrett - crane constraint .",
    "consider the quantum state space associated with a pair of triangles @xmath57 and @xmath58 of a tetrahedron .",
    "a general quantum state that just satisfies the simplicity constraints @xmath59 and @xmath60 is of the form @xmath61 @xmath62 , @xmath63 .    on the elements of @xmath64 the action @xmath65 is equivalent to the action of @xmath66 but since @xmath67 on @xmath61 we have @xmath68 ] .",
    "this implies that the cross - simplicity constraint @xmath69 requires the simultaneous rotation of @xmath70 involve only the @xmath29 @xmath71 representations .",
    "the simultaneous action of @xmath72 on the arguments of @xmath61 is@xmath73 the harmonic expansion of @xmath61 in terms of the basis function @xmath52 is@xmath74 the rest of the calculations can be understood graphically . the last equation can be graphically written as follows : @xmath75{jsimplicity1.eps}},\\ ] ] where the box @xmath76 represents the fourier coefficient @xmath77 .",

    "i have assumed all the repeated indices are either integrated or summed over for the previous and the next two equations .",
    "using this i can rewrite the @xmath83 and @xmath84 parts of the result ( [ gfresult ] ) as follows:@xmath85 and@xmath86 now we have @xmath87{jsimplicity3.eps}}.\\ ] ]    to satisfy the cross - simplicity constraint the expansion of @xmath88 must have contribution only from the terms with @xmath28 .",
    "let me remove all the terms which do not satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "also let me set @xmath89 now we can deduce that the functions denoted by @xmath90 obtained by reducing @xmath61 using the cross - simplicity constraints must have the expansion , @xmath91{jsimplicity35.eps}}\\text{,}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath92 introduced depends on the precise definition of the cross - simplicity projector . but as we will see , the final answer does not depend on the @xmath92 s . now",
    "the clebsch - gordan coefficient terms in the expansion can be re - expressed using the following equation : @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath13 and @xmath97 the bi - invariant measure on @xmath13 . using this in the two middle clebsch - gordan coefficients of @xmath90",

    "now the quantization of the fourth barrett - crane constraint demands that @xmath106 is invariant under the simultaneous rotation of its variables .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath107 is a constant function of @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the quantum state of a tetrahedron is spanned by@xmath108 where the measure @xmath109 on @xmath36 is derived from the bi - invariant measure on @xmath13 .",
