    "the gravitational wave sensitivity for the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) will be limited at low frequencies by the stray acceleration noise in the orbits of the nominally free - falling test masses that serve as interferometry end mirrors .",
    "the test mass ( mass @xmath2 ) acceleration noise @xmath3 is typically divided into a contribution from random , position independent forces ( @xmath4 ) and another from coupling ( with spring constant @xmath5 ) to the noisy motion of the spacecraft shield : @xmath6 the closed loop satellite position noise arises in the noise @xmath7 of the position sensor used to guide the satellite control and in the imperfect compensation of external forces @xmath8 acting on the satellite by the finite gain thruster control loop ( gain @xmath9 ) .",
    "lisa aims to limit the test mass acceleration noise spectral density to @xmath10 ( 3 fm / s@xmath0@xmath1 ) at frequencies down to 0.1  mhz @xcite .",
    "ltp is a single spacecraft experiment that tests drag - free control for lisa by measuring the differential motion of two test masses , each `` free - falling '' inside a lisa capacitive position sensor , along a single measurement axis ( the ltp configuration and measurement schemes are described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a schematic of the apparatus design is shown in fig .",
    "[ ltp_figure ] ) .",
    "the simpler 1-spacecraft , 1-axis configuration requires use of control forces along the measurement axis , a performance limiting departure from lisa . the main measurement for ltp , in which the satellite is controlled to follow the first test mass ( tm1 ) while the second test mass ( tm2 ) is forced electrostatically to follow the satellite , aims to put an overall acceleration noise upper limit of 30  fm / s@xmath0@xmath1  at 1  mhz , relaxed by an order of magnitude with respect to lisa in both noise level and frequency .",
    "in addition to a global limit on acceleration noise , ltp will fully characterize the satellite coupling term in eqn .",
    "[ eqn_lisa ] .",
    "the external force level @xmath8 can be extracted from the closed loop position sensor error signal , and the sensor noise can be obtained by comparison with a more precise optical readout .",
    "`` stiffness '' @xmath11 is measured by modulating the satellite control setpoint @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the random force measurements @xmath4 that will be possible aboard ltp . while the overall acceleration noise limit possible with ltp is an order of magnitude above the lisa goal , a special control scheme isolates the random force contribution , allowing measurement of @xmath12  to within a factor 2 of the lisa goal for most sources .",
    "additionally , several critical noise sources can be modulated coherently for precise measurement of their coupling into test mass acceleration .",
    "combined with the measurements of @xmath11 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 discussed above , the random force measurement pushes the characterization of the lisa noise budget to lower acceleration noise levels .",
    "precise measurement of key noise parameters will allow dissection of the random noise measurement as well as a more accurate extrapolation of the noise model to the lower frequencies and lower disturbance levels needed for lisa .",
    "the control scheme for the ltp random force measurement is a modified version of that used for the overall acceleration noise measurement mentioned above .",
    "the satellite is controlled to follow tm1 , and tm2 is controlled , by nulling the differential displacement interferometric readout , to follow tm1 . in this configuration",
    ", the residual error signal measured by the interferometer can be expressed @xmath13      - \\delta x \\ : { \\ensuremath{\\omega^2_{2p } } } + x_{n , opt } \\left ( { \\ensuremath{\\omega^2 _ { } } } - { \\ensuremath{\\omega^2_{2p } } } \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indices 1 and 2 refer to tm1 and tm2 , @xmath14 is the differential interferometry noise , @xmath15 is the distortion of the baseline separating the two position sensors , and @xmath16  is the electrostatic control loop gain for tm2 . here",
    "the satellite motion couples to the differential interferometry signal only through the stiffness difference @xmath17 $ ] , a small quantity which can be measured and , if necessary , tuned electrostatically to negligible magnitude @xcite .",
    "this control scheme thus minimizes the effect of stiffness , which is the limiting factor in the overall acceleration noise measurement , and thus isolates the random forces @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the noise in the interferometry signal @xmath20 in eqn .",
    "[ eq_ltp_m3 ] is thus a measurement of @xmath21 for lisa , with several additional ltp specific `` instrumental '' noise sources .",
    "in addition to the negligible contribution from satellite coupling , the baseline distortion term ( @xmath15 ) is also negligible for the high stability zerodur optical bench and 10@xmath22  k@xmath1  temperature stability projected for ltp .",
    "the remaining dominant instrumental noise sources for the ltp measurement of random force noise are then :    * _ interferometry noise _ noise in the differential interferometry readout converts into an effective random force noise ( directly from eqn .",
    "[ eq_ltp_m3 ] ) @xmath23 the ltp interferometry requirement is roughly 8  pm@xmath1  above  3 mhz and is relaxed as @xmath24 at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "this interferometry noise also includes a contribution from the thermal expansion of the test masses and optical windows , though this term should be small .",
    "interferometry noise is the dominant instrumental noise source above 3 mhz . *",
    "_ actuation noise _ any instability in the applied electrostatic actuation forces produces acceleration noise given by @xcite @xmath25 while actuation noise is part of the random force @xmath19 , we include it as an ltp instrumental noise source because it originates in the need to compensate a dc acceleration imbalance ( @xmath26 ) in ltp s 1-axis measurement configuration and is not present in lisa .",
    "limiting this noise source requires both high actuation voltage stability levels ( relative fluctuations @xmath27",
    "@xmath28 @xmath1at 1  mhz ) and tight gravitational balancing of the satellite ( @xmath29  1.3  nm / s@xmath0 ) .",
    "this is likely the dominant instrumental limitation to the ltp random force noise measurement below 3  mhz .",
    "here we have used eqn .",
    "[ eq_ltp_m3 ] to convert these instrumental disturbances into effective force noise , normalized to the random force noise on a single test mass @xmath12 and assuming that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are uncorrelated .",
    "the instrument noise limit for measuring such uncorrelated noise sources is roughly 5  fm / s@xmath0@xmath1at 1  mhz , within a factor 2 of the lisa goal . while the uncorrelation assumption holds for many sources , including electrostatic effects , circuitry back - action , and brownian noise sources , it is less valid for noise from temperature and magnetic field noise , which can act coherently on the two test masses ( the instrumental noise source conversion factor @xmath30 in the denominator of eqns .",
    "[ eqn_interfere ] and [ eqn_actuation ] would range from 0 - 2 depending on the nature and degree of correlation ) .",
    "we should point out , however , that these environmental disturbances are dominated by short range , on - board sources , and , additionally , that the physical mechanisms coupling to the environment ( such as the random residual magnetic moment ) are not likely to be equal in the two test masses .",
    "as such , a substantial cancellation , which would render ltp insensitive to such effects , is unlikely ..    before addressing individual random force noise sources relevant to ltp and lisa , we should clarify the frequency dependence of the sources in fig .",
    "[ ltp_instr_noise ] .",
    "first , noise sources which are not inherently frequency dependent ( for thermal gradient effects , for example , @xmath31 ) are drawn as flat ( `` white '' ) noise sources , even though they are likely to have a `` pink '' spectral shape due to a very likely low frequency increase in the driving noise source ( temperature fluctuations in this example ) . in the absence of detailed spectral information ,",
    "we choose to apply here the low frequency ( 1  mhz for ltp , 0.1  mhz for lisa ) target for the given fluctuations ( thermal , magnetic , sensor noise , etc ) even at higher frequencies where one would expect the noise to improve .",
    "for the same reason , we extend the ltp noise curves only to 1 mhz , the official low frequency limit of the mission .",
    "ltp will measure to even lower frequencies , but with sensitivity likely deteriorating as @xmath24 or worse , considering both the actuation and interferometer performance .",
    "several key random force noise sources are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ltp_instr_noise ] for ltp and in fig .",
    "[ lisa_noise ] for lisa ( references @xcite all address noise sources for ltp , drs , and lisa ) .",
    "the ltp random force noise measurement can , for specific known disturbances , be better extrapolated to the frequencies and environmental conditions of lisa by making precise measurements of the parameters that govern these noise sources .",
    "additionally , coupled with simultaneous measurements of environmental effects , they also permit debugging of the ltp force measurement itself , through correlation and possible subtraction of disturbances from the interferometry time series .",
    "this will also allow characterization of a noise source that might have escaped the random noise measurement because of a coherent cancellation between the two test masses .    to characterize a specific noise source , we employ the differential interferometer to detect forces excited by coherently modulating the given disturbance ( on one or both test masses ) , with the low background force noise allowing fn measurement resolution in a 1  hour measurement @xcite .",
    "envisioned measurements of known sources include :    * _ magnetic moment _ interaction of the test mass magnetic moment ( @xmath32 ) with magnetic field ( @xmath33 ) fluctuations produce a force @xmath34 , with moment @xmath32 likely dominated by the remnant ferromagnetic moment @xmath35 , which should be below 0.02  @xmath36a m@xmath0 for the au - pt test mass .",
    "the field gradient goal for ltp is 0.25  @xmath36t / m@xmath1 , improving to 0.025  @xmath36t / m@xmath1  for lisa .",
    "ltp will have magnetometers and helmholtz coils to measure and apply magnetic fields . with two coils oriented along the @xmath37-axis , symmetrically on either side of a test mass  /  sensor , the moment @xmath38",
    "can be measured by modulating a magnetic gradient @xmath39 ( currents opposing in the two coils ) and measuring the resulting force in @xmath37 .",
    "components @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be measured by applying a homogeneous field along @xmath37 ( parallel coil currents ) and observing the torques excited about , respectively , the @xmath42 and @xmath43 axes . in both cases",
    "field levels of order 10  @xmath36 t are sufficient for moment measurement at the percent level .",
    "while the test mass magnetic moment will also be measured on the ground , measurement in - flight will check for possible magnetic contamination occurring during final preparations , launch , or flight .",
    "* _ temperature gradient effects _ temperature differences between opposing faces in the position sensors that surround the test masses create forces through the radiometric effect and differential radiation pressure . for the 10@xmath44  pa pressure projected for the ltp position sensor vacuum chambers , differential radiation pressure is likely to be roughly twice as large as the radiometric effect , producing 2 fm / s@xmath0@xmath1  for the envisioned 1  mhz temperature difference stability of 10@xmath22  k@xmath1  ( lisa aims to improve this thermal stability by a factor 10 down to 0.1  mhz ) .",
    "an additional , less predictable thermal gradient force disturbance could arise in any temperature dependent outgassing of the sensor walls . to measure the total temperature gradient `` feedthrough , '' ltp",
    "will be equipped with thermometers and heaters , to excite and measure temperature differences across the position sensors , with differences as small as 10  mk allowing measurement within 1% of the radiation pressure effect .",
    "* _ stray dc electrostatic fields _ stray dc biases on the electrode surfaces of the capacitive position sensors can interact with the noisy test mass charge and dielectric noise to produce low frequency acceleration noise @xcite .",
    "the dc biases can be measured with modulated sensing voltages and then compensated by applying appropriate `` counter - bias '' voltages with the actuation circuitry .",
    "measurement of stray dc biases of tens of mv , and their compensation to within 1  mv , has been demonstrated on ground @xcite and will be performed on ltp and lisa to significantly reduce this potentially dangerous noise source ( figs .",
    "[ ltp_instr_noise ] and [ lisa_noise ] assume a more modest compensation to within 10  mv ) .",
    "longer measurements could also characterize the noise in the stray bias itself , a possible noise source at very low frequencies . *",
    "_ cross - talk effects _ the coupling of residual satellite motion along the non - measurement translational and rotational degrees of freedom into acceleration along the critical @xmath37 axis is an important and complicated noise source for both ltp and lisa .",
    "one example is the gravity gradient @xmath45 , which is dominated by the massive optical bench lying just beneath the axis connecting tm1 and tm2 and could be as large as @xmath46/s@xmath47 ; this accelerates a test mass in @xmath37 in response to satellite motion in @xmath42 .",
    "another example is the @xmath37 acceleration noise arising through the slight rotation of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 actuation forces with the satellite rotational noise .",
    "cross - talk effects could be as big as 5 - 10  fm / s@xmath0@xmath1  in the ltp random force noise measurement , where a modest level of off - axis satellite control is considered acceptable for cost reasons ( ltp requires 70  nm@xmath1  on the @xmath43 and @xmath42 axes , compared to 10 for lisa ) .",
    "cross - talk feedthrough coefficients can be measured by coherent modulation , at the @xmath36 m level , of the spacecraft position via the control setpoints on different axes .",
    "achievement of ltp s principle scientific objective , demonstrating an overall acceleration noise limit of 30  fm / s@xmath0@xmath1  at 1  mhz , is sufficient to establish lisa s capability to detect a host of interesting gravitational wave sources @xcite",
    ". the higher precision measurement of the random force noise discussed here , to within roughly twice the lisa goal at 1  mhz , will further increase confidence in lisa s performance goals .",
    "this improves substantially upon the resolution of earth based torsion pendulum measurements of stray forces ( currently roughly two orders of magnitude above lisa s goal at 1 mhz @xcite ) and confronts many of the challenges of precision metrology in space , from launch survival to all - axes satellite control , that lisa will face .",
    "additionally , the coherent disturbance experiments will extend modelling of key noise sources to lisa s lower frequencies , with noise parameter measurements performed in representative flight conditions subject to possible damage and contamination , from handling , launch , or the satellite environment , that could affect sensitive surface electrostatic , magnetic , or outgassing properties for lisa ."
