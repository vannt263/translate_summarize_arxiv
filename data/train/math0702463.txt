    "quite a few recent papers use the term `` scale - free networks '' to refer to those large sparse graphs formed from real - world data .",
    "such graphs often exhibit power - law degree distributions .",
    "namely , the number of vertices with degree @xmath1 is roughly proportional to @xmath2 , for some positive @xmath3 .",
    "however , the term `` scale - free '' is rarely defined in the literature , at least in the rigorous mathematical sense .",
    "furthermore , accounts in the literature of how power laws arise have been largely model - dependent .",
    "that is , a number of models of random - graph growth have been proposed that give rise , under circumstances of varying generality , to power - law degree distributions .",
    "the most popular growth model of this kind is the `` preferential attachment '' scheme , exemplified by @xcite .",
    "though many of the growth rules are quite intuitive  in that one expects many real - world phenomena to approximate them  an explanation of the sheer ubiquity of power laws that does not appeal to particular models is conspicuously lacking .    here",
    "we attempt to address these omissions .",
    "first , it is natural to ask , what is a scale ?",
    "an obvious candidate for a scale is the number of vertices of a graph . here",
    "`` scaling the graph down '' means `` taking an induced subgraph '' .",
    "of course , subgraphs may look quite different from one another .",
    "hence , we consider only the average behavior . + * random induced subgraph @xmath4 : * for any @xmath5 , let @xmath4 be the induced subgraph of @xmath6 on a random subset of vertices @xmath7 . for each vertex @xmath8 of @xmath6",
    ", @xmath8 is in @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 independently .",
    "+ there are some simple cases that the graph @xmath4 is similar to @xmath6 . for example ,    * let @xmath6 be a complete graph on @xmath11 vertices",
    ". then @xmath4 is also a complete graph on around @xmath12 vertices .",
    "* let @xmath6 be an empty graph on @xmath11 vertices .",
    "then @xmath4 is also an empty graph on around @xmath12 vertices .",
    "* for any constant @xmath13 , let @xmath6 be the random graph @xmath14",
    ". then @xmath4 is also a random graph @xmath15 over a randomly chosen set of size @xmath16 .",
    "crucially , these examples are not `` real - world graphs '' , in the sense that graphs appearing `` in nature '' tend to be quite sparse .",
    "most vertices have small degrees .",
    "to characterize this property , we use the following definition : + for a given sequence @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 , with @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , a sequence of graphs @xmath21 on @xmath11 vertices is said to have degree sequence with limit distribution @xmath17 if the number of vertices with degree @xmath1 in @xmath22 is @xmath23 for each @xmath20 .",
    "we also say that @xmath21 has limit distribution @xmath24 , for @xmath25 , if @xmath22 has @xmath23 vertices of degree @xmath1 for each @xmath26 .",
    "we consider two questions .    1 .",
    "if the degree sequence of @xmath6 in @xmath27 has a limit distribution , for any fixed @xmath10 , does the degree sequence of the random induced subgraph @xmath4 also have a limit distribution ? 2 .",
    "for what distribution @xmath28 is the limit distribution of the degree sequence of @xmath4 essentially the same as the limit distribution of the degree sequence of @xmath6 ?    to answer the first question , we observe that a vertex of degree @xmath29 in @xmath6 would badly affect the concentration of the degree sequence of @xmath4 . on the other hand , using the vertex - exposure martingale",
    ", we can show that the degree sequence of @xmath4 will have a limit distribution if @xmath30 this condition is satisfied , for example , if @xmath6 has maximum degree bounded by @xmath31 .",
    "suppose @xmath32 is the degree frequency sequence of a graph @xmath6 , with @xmath33 representing the number of vertices in @xmath6 with degree @xmath1 .",
    "what is the degree frequency sequence of @xmath4 ?",
    "if a vertex @xmath8 survives in @xmath4 , its degree has binomial distribution @xmath34 .",
    "there is no simple way to describe the joint distribution because of edge - correlations . nonetheless , the expected degree frequency sequence for @xmath4 is easy to compute .",
    "let @xmath35 be the expected degree frequency sequence of the random induced subgraph @xmath4 .",
    "we have @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 depends linearly on @xmath39 .",
    "we can therefore normalize both sequences by dividing by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , from now on , we assume @xmath40 are the fraction of numbers of vertices with degree @xmath41 in graph @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , we consider a sequence of graphs @xmath42 , such that the number of vertices with degree @xmath1 in @xmath42 is @xmath43 .",
    "we only consider sparse graphs such that @xmath44    it is worth remarking that this manuscript can be read , in effect , as a response to the well - known stumpf , wiuf , and may paper , `` subnets of scale - free networks are not scale - free : sampling properties of networks '' ( @xcite ) and its authors related publications .",
    "although the present authors became aware of this work only after discovering the results below , it is clear that there is a very strong resemblance to the work of stumpf , wiuf , and may .",
    "however , we offer the counter - assertion `` subnets of scale - free networks _",
    "are _ scale - free , as long as one ignores suitably small - degree vertices . ''",
    "we also take a somewhat different tack by studying , in particular , the asymptotic conditions under which scale - freeness holds .",

    "divide both sides of equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) by @xmath76 and integrate it with respect to @xmath10 from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",

    "we believe that the situation is very similar to that of graphs when the hypergraphs being considered are uniform ( with edges removed whenever at least one of their vertices is removed ) .",
    "perhaps the answer lies in a more refined description of scale - freeness .",
