    "since pioneering works of jelley  @xcite and scheibe  @xcite , who discovered the phenomenon of linear aggregation of polymethine dye molecules in solution with rising their volume concentration and , as a result , drastic changes of their optical properties ( the appearance of a red - shifted narrow band , called now j - band ) , these species have been the subject of unremitting interest of reseachers . in the beginning of the nineties , wiersma and co - workers  @xcite demonstrated the possibility of further narrowing of the j - band as well as shortening of its emission lifetime by an order of magnitude via cooling to the temperature of liquid helium . at present , it is widely accepted that the unusual properties of such systems originate from the fact that their optically active states are frenkel exciton states ( see for a comprehensive review refs . and  ) .    in recent time , a considerable attention has been drawn to the problem of strong coupling of organic polymers and molecular aggregates to resonant radiation .",
    "room temperature spectral narrowing of emission  @xcite and cooperative emission  @xcite in @xmath0-conjugated polymer thin films , superradiant lasing from the j - aggregated cyanine dye molecules adsorbed onto colloidal silica and silver  @xcite as well as the room temperature polariton emission from strongly coupled organic semiconductor microcavities  @xcite have been reported .",
    "all these effects unambiguously mean a collectivization of polymers and j - aggregates via the emission field and are of great importance from the viewpoint of laser applications ( see refs .   for reviews )",
    ". on the other hand , the conditions of such a strong coupling are those necessary for manifestation of a bistable behavior of a collection of homogeneously broadened two - level systems .",
    "much efforts have been undertaken to this problem with its projection to j - aggregated assemblies .",
    "the conditions for the bistable optical response to observe from an individual j - aggregate  @xcite and even of a dimer  @xcite have been analized .",
    "bistability discussed in refs .   is attributed to _ an individual _ aggregate and consists of an abrupt switching of the aggregate population from a low level to a higher one as the pump intensity rises .",
    "consequently , the reflectivity ( transmittivity ) of a macroscopic ensemble of such species may be switched off ( on ) in a step - wise way , allowing thus creation of an all - optical bistable element .",
    "the effect we are speaking about originates from the dynamical resonance frequency shift dependent on the population of the system .",
    "however , as it has been shown in refs .   and  , an aggregate of a length smaller than the emission wavelength does not display any bistable behavior .",
    "this finding makes the above mechanism of the aggregate bistability to be hardly experimentally verified . indeed , despite an aggregate may incorporate to itself thousands of molecules and thus may have a length larger than the emission wavelength , in reality , only a subsystem of segments , consisting of a portion of the aggregate ( the so - called coherently bound molecules ) , responds to the action of a resonant external field .",
    "@xcite because of a disorder ( of static and thermal nature ) of the surroundings , the exciton coherence length , being the physical length of an aggregate in the absence of disorder , is reduced to a size @xmath1 dependent on the degree of disorder . for the real conditions ,",
    "the number @xmath1 is usually smaller than the emission wavelength counted in the lattice unit . at room temperature , @xmath1 is determined basically by dephasing ( originated from thermal fluctuations of molecular positions ) and has an order of magnitude of several lattice units .",
    "@xcite on decreasing the temperature , disorder tends to be of static nature .",
    "it is determined by static fluctuations of the aggregate structure as well as the surroundings and becomes dominating as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "the static disorder results in anderson localization of the exciton within an aggregate segment with the typical size of the order of several tens of lattice units .",
    "the number of molecules within the localization length plays now the role of @xmath1 and , in fact , represents a higher limit for the number of coherently bound molecules . further increasing @xmath1",
    "would be possible by means of reducing the degree of static disorder that is generally out of control .    in this connection , in refs .",
    "the question was risen whether _",
    "an ensemble _ of localized exciton states may behave in a bistable fashion .",
    "it was used the fact that the exciton states , located within the same localization domain and being active in the optical response , form a local energy structure with a few levels ( two or three ) similar to the one existing on a regular chain with length @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite in other words , an aggregated sample can be modelled by an ensemble of short ( compared to the emission wavelength ) linear frenkel chains stochastically distributed over their lengths @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown that an ultrathin film with a thickness much smaller than the emission wavelength ( which makes possible to use the mean - field approach ) manifested bistability of the resonance optical response .    in this paper , we follow the conjecture proposed in refs .   and generalize the results reported there to film thicknesses of the order of or larger than the emission wavelength , when the mean - field approach , being an adequate approximation for thinner films , is no longer valid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the model and mathematical formalism . section  [ utf ] deals with an analysis of the feasibility of a bistable response from an ultrathin film ( under the condition of validity of the mean field approximation ) , taking into account the fluctuations of all exciton optical parameters , such as the one - exciton transition frequency and dipole moment as well as the one - exciton exciton radiative rate .  @xcite further ( sec .",
    "[ numerics ] ) , we present results of numerical simulations for thin films of thickness larger than the emission wavelength and determine the ranges of driving parameters , for which the film reflectivity and transmittivity manifests bistability . in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] , we make estimates for j - aggregates of pic and show that critical parameters for the occurence of such a behavior seems to be achievable for thin films at low temperatures . finally , sec .",
    "[ concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "some preliminary results of the present study have been reported in our recent paper .",
    "an elementary object of an ensemble we will be dealing with represents a short ( with a length smaller than the emission wavelength ) ordered linear chain consisting of @xmath3 two - level molecules ( with @xmath3 much larger than unity ) . due to the strong intermolecular dipolar coupling ,",
    "the optically active states are the frenkel exciton states rather than the states of individual molecules . in the nearest - neighbour approximation , which we adopt hereinafter",
    ", one - dimensional frenkel excitons appear to be non - interacting fermions  @xcite so that any state with a fixed number of excitons can be constructed as a slater determinant of one - exciton states @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ket - vector of the excited state of the @xmath6th molecule .",
    "the energies of the one - dimensional exciton gas may take the values @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the occupation number of the @xmath9th one - exciton state and @xmath10 is the corresponding energy given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transition frequency of an isolated molecule and @xmath13 ( chosen hereinafter to be positive ) is the magnitude of the nearest - neighbour hopping integral .    the optical transition from the ground state of the chain to the lowest state of the one exciton band @xmath14",
    "has the dominating oscillator strength ( @xmath15 of the total one ; see , for instance , ref .  ) .",
    "furthermore , the transition betweeen the bottoms of one - exciton and two - exciton bands is blue - shifted as compared to the ground - state - to - one - exciton band bottom transition by an energy @xmath16 .",
    "the blue shift originates of the fermionic nature of one - dimensional frenkel excitons and was experimentally verified for the first time in ref .  .",
    "these two facts were put forward in ref .   as a motivation to consider the transition from the ground state to the bottom of the one - exciton band as an isolated two - level transition .",
    "this assumption can indeed be approved provided that the actual rabi frequency of the external field is smaller than the blue shift of one - to - two exciton transitions .",
    "further analysis of the transitions to higher exciton manifolds showed that they did not lead to qualitative changes of the behavior found within the framework of the two - level model .",
    "@xcite based on these findings and taking into account that the spatial inhomogeneity of the field and matter variables complicates the treatment drastically , we will use in what follows the two - level approach to describe the matter response .",
    "thus , we model the ensemble of linear frenkel chains as that comprised of inhomogeneously broadened ( due to the fluctuations of chain lengths ) two - level systems , but with the optical characteristics of the transition having all attributes of a one - exciton transition .",
    "note that neglecting the one - to - two - exciton optical transitions means that no more than one exciton per chain is created by the external field .",
    "respectively , such a channel of efficient exciton quenching as the intra - chain exciton - exciton annihilation  @xcite plays no role within the framework of the two - level approximation . in principle , the excitonic annihilation can involve two excitons created on different chains . as follows , however , from the results presented in ref .  , the rate of such a process is negligible under the restrictions of our model : low temperature and @xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that the transition dipole moments of all chains are parallel to each other as well as to the film plane .",
    "@xcite with regard to the input field @xmath18 , the on - resonance and normal incidence conditions are chosen .",
    "the input field polarization can be set without loss of generality to be directed along the transition dipole moment .",
    "then , all quantities can be considered as scalars .    under the above limitations , the time evolution of the film",
    "is described in terms of the @xmath19 density matrix @xmath20  standing for determination of the state of a chain of length @xmath3 .",
    "the density matrix equation together with the maxwell equation for the total field @xmath21 , including a secondary field produced by the film , form the closed system of equations in the problem we are dealing with .",
    "it reads    [ 1 ] @xmath22 @xmath23 - \\gamma_{1 } ( z + 1)\\ , \\label{1_zn}\\ ] ] @xmath24    where the dots denote time derivatives ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26\\approx \\omega_{21 } - 2u/\\hbar + u\\pi^2/\\hbar n^2 $ ] is the transition frequency for an individual chain of size @xmath3 ; @xmath27 is the transition dipole moment of a chain of size @xmath3 scaled as @xmath28  , where @xmath29 is the transition dipole moment for an isolated molecule ; @xmath30 is the spontaneous emission constant of the optically active one - exciton state : @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the analogous constant for an isolated molecule ( for the sake of simplicity , we have replaced the numerical factor @xmath33 in the expression for @xmath27 and @xmath30 by unity ) ; @xmath34 is the dephasing constant including the contribution ( @xmath35 ) not connected with the radiative damping .",
    "the last formula of the set ( [ 1 ] ) is nothing else but the integral form of the maxwell equation for a film , in which @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the speed of light and for the film thickness , respectively , and @xmath38 is the electric polarization : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the volume density of chains in the film and the angle brackets denote averaging over the chain length distribution with a probability distribution function @xmath41 : @xmath42 .    as was pointed out in refs .",
    ", using the integral wave equation to study the non - stationary nonlinear response from a dense absorber has an obvious advantage : the boundary conditions are not required within this framework .",
    "indeed , the reflected @xmath43 and transmitted @xmath44 fields can be calculated obviously on the basis of eq.([1_maxwell_eq ] ) if the spatial distribution of the electric polarization @xmath38 is known .",
    "the latter , in turn , is calculated from constituent equations  ( [ 1_rho21 ] ) - ( [ 1_zn ] ) and  ( [ p ] ) . the background refraction index is not included in eq.([1_maxwell_eq ] ) because , in fact , this simply results in constant renormalization .",
    "@xcite    rigorously speaking , for a dense system as that we are considering , the deviation of the acting field from the average ( maxwell ) field may be significant .",
    "a simpleast way to account for this difference is to add the ( lorentz - lorenz ) local - field correction in the form @xmath45 to the maxwell field @xmath21 in the matter equations  ( [ 1_rho21])-([1_zn ] ) ( see , for instance , ref .  ) . along this paper , however , we will neglect the local field correction justifying this approximation by our previous study : for that arrangement of the incident fequency we are going to study ( see sec .  [ numerics ] ) , this correction leads only to small quantitative effects .",
    "@xcite    assume that the incident field has the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the frequency and wavenumber , respectively , and @xmath49 is the amplitude , slowly varying in the scale of the optical period @xmath50 .",
    "thus , by passing to the rotating frame by means of the representation @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with complex amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath54 slowly varying in time , and neglecting the counter - rotating terms , we obtain the set of truncated equations    [ 2 ] @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    here , the notation @xmath58 is introduced .    the reflected and transmitted",
    "waves we are interested in are simply given by the formulae :    [ 3 ] @xmath59 @xmath60 e^{ik_il}\\ . \\label{transmfield}\\ ] ]    as in our previous papers ,  @xcite we will neglect the retardation effects replacing @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the actual passage time of the light through the film has the order of magnitude of the optical period while all the characteristic times of the problem discussed @xmath62 are much longer .",
    "one can , therefore , consider the field as propagating instantaneously inside the film .    to perform numerical calculations ,",
    "let us rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) in a dimensionless form using the dimensionless field amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath64 as well as the dimensionless spatial and temporal coordinates @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the mean transition dipole moment and the mean relaxation constant , respectively .",

    "the quantity @xmath86 can be identified with the inhomogeneous width of the exciton absorption line , so that the limits @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 and @xmath90 in dimensional units ) correspond to the cases of dominating homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening , respectively .",
    "equations  ( [ 4 ] ) constitute the basis of our analysis of the optical response from a thin film consisting of linear frenkel chains",

    "[ fig1 ] the curve ( dashed ) obtained under the approximations used in ref .  , i.e. , assuming the detuning @xmath83 as being the unique stochastic variable and setting @xmath117 .",
    "as can be seen , there is almost no difference between the solid and dashed curves .",
    "this means that indeed , fluctuations of the detuning basically determine the result of averaging in eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] with solid lines . with dotted lines , we present the results of analogous calculations obtained only by switching back the incident field amplitude from a higher ( @xmath127 ) to a lower ( @xmath125 ) value .    from these data ,",
    "it can be claimed first that the transient time depends on whether the incident field amplitude is switched up or down .",
    "second , the transient time is of the order of a few units of the population relaxation time @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , in units of @xmath129 this time interval is of the order of 10 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath130 in this particular calculation , one arrives at the above stated conclusion .",
    "in our previous studies of nonlinear resonant reflection from an extended ( @xmath131 ) dense system of _ homogeneously broadened _ two - level molecules ,  @xcite we found that the reflectivity of such a system could show different regimes ( bistability and self - oscillations  @xcite as well as chaos  @xcite ) basically governed by the parameter @xmath132 , instead of @xmath133 for an ultrathin film ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath132 is nothing but the halfwidth ( in units of the homogeneous width @xmath134 ) of a gap in the spectrum of field + molecules collective excitations - polaritons ( polariton splitting ; see for more details the monograph by davydov  ) .",
    "this gap appears in the vicinity of the molecule - field resonance and requires the condition @xmath135 to be fulfilled . the linear dielectric constant for frequencies ranging within",
    "the gap is negative ( the refractive index is imaginary ) , implying total reflection of the light of such frequencies .",
    "@xcite    the physical origin of the effects reported in refs .",
    "is attributed to saturation of the refraction index by the field acting within the polariton band gap .",
    "let us recall briefly the motivation rised in those papers . for an input field varying slowly in the scale of the relaxation times @xmath136 ( the case of our interest in the present study ) ,",

    "the higher the field amplitudes , the deeper the field penetrates into the medium .",

    "@xcite this interface plays the role of an `` artificial '' mirror giving rise to a feedback necessary for the effects outlined above to build up .",
    "it turned out that namely in the limit of larger @xmath132 , i.e. , in the presence of the polariton band gap , the system shows the above mentioned peculiarities of nonlinear optical response that are absent in the opposite case @xmath150 .",
    "when inhomogeneous broadening dominates ( the main range of our interest ) , one should compare the inhomogeneous width @xmath151 with the width of the gap @xmath152 .",
    "a simple analysis of eq .  ( [ nonlindielfunc ] ) reveals the clear result that a well - pronounced gap ( where the dielectric function has a dominating negative real part ) develops at @xmath153 .",
    "an inhomogeneous broadening of the order of , or higher than @xmath152 destroys the gap and , as a consequence , all the nonlinear effects accompanying the presence of this gap .",
    "below , we show details of the influence of inhomogeneous broadening on the nonlinear optical response of the film .      all nonlinear features accompanying the presence of the polariton gap",
    "were found to be stronger when the input field frequency lies in the middle of the gap , i.e. , at @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite therefore , when studying the nonlinear reflection from and transmission through a film consisting of _ inhomogeneously broadened _ two - level systems , we will also set @xmath155 and consider @xmath156 ( @xmath157 is the threshold for bistability in reflection  @xcite ) to get the optimal conditions for the effects we are looking for .",
    "it is worth noting that , as was found in ref .  , the local - field correction at @xmath155 has a relatively small quantitative effect .",
    "in particular , the threshold value @xmath157 changes from 4.66 to 5.45 if the local - field correction is taken into account .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] presents examples of the input field dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients for a thin film of thickness @xmath158 depending on the inhomogeneous width @xmath159 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 were fixed ( @xmath160 ) and @xmath161 was varied .",

    "[ fig4 ] , is that the switching amplitudes of the input field do not depend strongly on the inhomogeneous width ( at a fixed magnitude of @xmath132 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we depicted spatial profiles of the amplitude module of the field inside the film versus the input field amplitude @xmath119 .",

    ", we can claim the following . despite the fact that the thickness of the system does not exceed one wavelength in vacuum , @xmath166 , the field inside the film is not uniform at any amplitude of the input field . for not - saturating magnitudes of @xmath119 ,",
    "this is simply explained by the fact that the ( linear ) refraction index in this case ( at @xmath155 ) @xmath167 , that , in turn , gives rise to decreasing the field amplitude on a scale short compared to @xmath166 . at higher magnitudes of the input field , ranging within the bistable interval ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the spatial inhomogeneity of the field demonstrates a global character , originating in the interplay between the forward and backward ( in the present case , reflected from the back boundary of the film ) waves .",
    "comparison of the field profiles depicted in the plots ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) at a fixed magnitude of the input field reveals that they differ one from the other . in other words",
    ", one may make a statement about the existence of spatial hysteresis of the field inside the film .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] sheds light on the transient time of approaching the reflectivity ( a ) and transmittivity ( b ) their stationary values when switching the incident field amplitude up ( solid lines ) and down ( dotted lines ) , similar to that presented in fig .",

    "[ fig7 ] we present the data of similar calculations as depicted in fig .  [ fig4 ] performed for thicker films : @xmath171 and @xmath172 . as follows from these results , the hysteresis in reflection remains to be very pronounced .",
    "however , it tends to disappear in transmittivity .",
    "it is simply due to the fact that in order to make transparent a film of higher thickness , one needs to apply an input field of very high amplitude , for which the system already does not manifest at all bistability in transmission .",
    "by contrast , with regards to reflection , the film behaves as a `` semi - infinite '' medium , for which bistability in reflection may occur provided the parameter @xmath132 exceeds its critical value @xmath173 .",

    "[ fig8 ] , we depicted the spatial profile of the field inside the film with thickness @xmath171 for the conditions for bistability to occur .",
    "it is clear from these pictures that the field is absolutely attenuated within a depth a bit longer than @xmath166 and , hence , the transmittivity in this case is negligible .    as follows from our previos",
    "study  @xcite of the nonlinear reflection from a collection of dense _ homogeneosly broadened _ two - level atoms , the system may show instabilities of different types ( self - oscillation and chaos ) at higher values of the polariton splitting @xmath132 .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] presents an example of such a behavior of the film reflectivity ( self - oscillation ) for @xmath174 and the _ inhomogeneous broadening _",
    "the attempt to get a hysteresis loop of the reflection coefficient reveals that the lower branch is unstable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9]_a _ ) .",
    "the calculation done at a fixed amplitude of the input field ( @xmath175 , above the switching threshold ) shows that indeed , the system has a regime of self - oscillations with a frequency of the order of @xmath176 .",
    "first , let us discuss the applicability of the two - level model used in this paper .",
    "one should compare the typical energy spacing between the first and second exciton levels @xmath177 with the switching magnitude of the input field @xmath119 .",
    "for the parameters at hand , the former quantity ranges within the interval @xmath178 $ ] while the latter is approximately equal to @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that our approach is correct and there is no necessity to include the one - to - two exciton transitions .",
    "it is worthwhile to analyze the parameters of real systems in order to get insight into feasibility of the bistable mechanism we are dealing with . in this sense ,",
    "the j - aggregates of pic , as one of the most studied species of the type we need , seem to be suitable objects .",
    "the width of the red j - band of pic - br ( centered at @xmath180 nm ) , at low temperature , has an inhomogeneous nature and an order of magnitude of @xmath181 ( or @xmath182 in frequency units )  @xcite .",
    "the blue shift of the transition from one - to - two exciton bands with respect to that from the ground state to the one - exciton band for the red j - band has the same order .",
    "the polariton splitting is @xmath183 , so that taking @xmath184  and @xmath185  ( an achievable concentration of molecules before aggregation ) , we obtain @xmath186 , i.e. , a value that exceeds twice the halfwidth of the j - band @xmath187 ( @xmath188 in our notation ) . hence ,",
    "for the parameters used , we are under the conditions needed for bistability to occur .",
    "in this paper , we have numerically studied the optical bistable response of a thin film with thickness of the order of and larger than the emission wavelength , comprised of oriented linear frenkel chains .",
    "we have taken into account a distribution of chains over length , resulting in an inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton optical transition as well as in the distribution of the transition dipole moment .",
    "\\(i ) within a certain range of driving parameters ( resonance detuning , polariton splitting , and inhomogeneous width ) , the films of thickness of the order of the vacuum emission wavelength really show a bistable behavior with respect to both the reflection and transmission of the resonant light ;          \\(v ) the parameters needed for the bistable behavior seem to be achievable for a thin film of j - aggregates of polymethine dyes and for some classes of conjugated polymers deposited onto a dielectric substrate such as poly(_p_-phenylene - vinylene ) derivatives .    the inhomogeneous broadening acts as a destructive factor .",
    "reducing any source of inhomogeneity is thus of great importance . in this sense ,",
    "thin films comprised of thiophene oligomers seem to be very attractive objects , too , due to the possibility of precise controlling the sizes of this type of molecules .",
    "@xcite    to conclude , it is to be noting that the authors of ref .   reported a room - temperature formation of polariton states in ordered cyanine dye films .",
    "the latter thus can also be considered as a promising object from the viewpoint of our findings .",
