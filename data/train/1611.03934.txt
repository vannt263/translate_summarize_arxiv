    "organ transplantation is the therapy of choice for patients with end stage diseases who are refractory to medical therapies ( shah 2012 ) . even though organ transplantation can increase the life expectancy and quality of life for the recipient , the operation can entail various complications , including infection , acute and chronic rejection and malignancy ( huynh 2014 ) .",
    "pre - operative anticipation of the risk associated with organ transplantation is a regular task that transplant centers perform in order to determine which patients would benefit from transplantation and accurately identify these for whom the risk of transplantation is too high and would therefore provide no survival benefits .",
    "such a risk assessment task is quite complicated for that post - operative patient survival depends on different types of risk factors : recipient - related factors ( e.g. cardiovascular disease severity of heart recipients ( wozniak 2014 ; nwakanma 2007 ; russo 2006 ; silva 2016 ) ) , recipient - donor matching factors ( e.g. weight ratio and hla ( jayarajan 2013 ) , blood group compatibility ( jawitz 2013 ) , race ( allen 2010 ) , etc ) , and donor - related factors ( e.g. diabetes ( arnaoutakis 2012 ; taghavi 2013 ) ) .",
    "the interactions among all these risk factors make the prognosis problem for the organ transplant outcomes highly complex ; the nhlbi working group suggests resolving this problem by enhancing the phenotypic compatibility characterization of the pre - transplant recipient - donor population ( mancini 2010 ; collins 2015 ; shah 2012 ) .    in the light of the above",
    ", we seek an enhanced phenotypic characterization for the compatibility of patient - donor pairs via a _ precision medicine _ approach ( collins 2015 ) in which we construct _ personalized _ predictive models that are tailored to the individual traits of both the donor and the recipient to the finest possible granularity .",
    "the advent of electronic health records ( ehr ) inspire a data - driven approach for constructing such predictive models in which the complex recipient - donor compatibility patterns are discovered from observational data . to that end",
    ", we develop _ confidentmatch _ : an automated system that learns the recipient - donor compatibility patterns from the ehr data in terms of the probability of transplant success for given recipient - donor pairs .",
    "confidentmatch can be utilized by the clinicians as a prognostic tool for managing organ transplantation selection decisions in which information about the donor and recipient are fed to the system , and the output comes as the probability of the transplant s success .",
    "the system can also be used in conjunction with a matching algorithm , such as the nobel prize winning algorithm of shapley and roth ( shapley 1962 ; roth 2003 ) , where a set of patients are matched to a set of donors given the compatibility scores that confidentmatch computes .    in order to learn the highly complex recipient - donor compatibility patterns , confidentmatch adopts a novel learning framework in which the recipient - donor feature space is partitioned into disjoint subsets , and a separate predictive model ( learner ) is assigned to each partition .",
    "such a learning approach gives rise to a highly complex overall predictive model for mapping recipient - donor features to transplant success probabilities . over - fitting",
    "is controlled by penalizing the number of partitions in the recipient - donor feature space and the complexity of the learners assigned to the different partitions .",
    "unlike existing meta - learning algorithms , confidentmatch solves an optimization problem through which it jointly determines how to partition the recipient - donor feature space , and what predictive model to assign to each partition .",
    "since such an optimization problem is np - hard , we propose an efficient greedy algorithm that proceed iteratively by first fixing the number of partitions in the recipient - donor feature space , optimizing the predictive models assigned to each partition , and then further stratifying each partition and re - assigning more ",
    "specialized \" predictive models to the new , finer partitions .",
    "the algorithm stops stratifying the recipient - donor feature space when further stratification would lead to new partitions with no enough per - partition training data for learning finer predictive models .",
    "experiments conducted on the unos heart transplant dataset ( cecka 1996 ) show that confidentmatch can provide predictions of success with 95@xmath0 confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients  410 more patients than for the best state - of - the - art machine learning algorithm ( deepboost ) .",
    "we identify two broad categories of learning algorithms that are capable of combining multiple predictive models and/or stratifying the feature space into fine clusters : ensemble learning algorithms and clustering algorithms .",
    "we compare confidentmatch with these methods hereunder . +   + * ensemble learning algorithms * methods based on ensemble learning , such as random forest ( liaw 2002 ) , logitboost ( friedman et al . 2000 ) , adaptive boosting ( freund 1997 ) and deepboost ( kuznetsov 2014 ) , operate by allocating different sets of training data to different weak learners , and then aggregating the predictions of these weak learners through a weighted sum to issue a final prediction ( dai et al . 2016 ) and ( tekin et al .",
    "while these methods can learn complex functions through the synergy of multiple weak learners , they do not integrate the allocation of the training data to the different learners ( in both the bagging and boosting approaches ) as part of their loss minimization problems .",
    "therefore , these methods do not  in principle ",
    "learn a granular predictive model that performs well uniformly over the feature space , but rather learn a predictive model that works well  on average \" .",
    "contrarily , confidentmatch jointly optimizes the partitioning of the feature space together with the predictive model associated with each partition , and hence , it learns a refined recipient - donor phenotypic compatibility characterization in which the predictions are tailored to fine segments of the recipient - donor feature space , leading to an overall improved performance as compared to conventional ensemble methods .",
    "we will demonstrate the superiority of confidentmatch to ensemble learning algorithms in the  results and discussion \" section .",
    "+   + * clustering algorithms * clustering is a natural approach for identifying phenotypic characterizations by grouping  similar \" patients ( or recipient - donor pairs ) into distinct clusters .",
    "clustering algorithms can be divided into two categories : unsupervised and supervised clustering .",
    "unsupervised clustering algorithms , such as the @xmath1-means algorithm ( macqueen 1967 ) , utilize the feature space solely to learn the partitions that maximize some given objective , and hence they can not address the organ transplant prognosis problem since they do not consider the transplant outcomes ( i.e. labels ) in the clustering process .    supervised clustering algorithms utilize both the feature space and the label space for constructing clusters ( eick 2004 ; finley 2005 ) ; however , the predictive models assigned to each partition of the feature space are limited to indicator functions ( an example for such algorithms is the regression tree ( strobl 2009 ) ) . for the organ transplant setting ,",
    "the complex interactions between the donor and recipient features create highly complex patterns of recipient - donor compatibility ( transplant success probabilities ) that would exhibit very high per - partition impurity under conventional supervised clustering or tree learning algorithms .",
    "this means that learning such complex medical concepts would face the dilemma of exhibiting large over - fitting errors when adopting a large number of clusters ( or very deep decision trees ) to resolve the per - partition impurity , and exhibiting a large bias error when restricting the number of clusters ( or restricting the depth of decision trees ) .",
    "confidentmatch approaches this problem by providing a versatile framework for complexity control where complex predictive models can be assigned to every partition to reduce the per - partition bias error , which enables learning complex functions with less partitions and hence utilize the training data more efficiently .",
    "let the @xmath2-dimensional recipient - donor feature space be denoted as @xmath3 ; every instance in @xmath3 corresponds to a recipient - donor pair with certain given characteristics .",
    "denote the corresponding label space which designates the success or failure of an organ transplant for a given recipient - donor pair as @xmath4 ; every label instance can be defined as the specific event of transplant success or failure if @xmath5 , or the probability of the transplant s success if @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath7 be a dataset extracted from the ehr ; we split the dataset @xmath7 into two separate sets : a training set @xmath8 and a validation set @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are disjoint ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "every entry in @xmath10 and @xmath11 comprise a recipient - donor feature pair and a transplant outcome .",
    "the goal of confidentmatch is to construct a predictive model @xmath13 that maps recipient - donor pairs to anticipated transplant outcomes ; such a model has to be learned from the dataset @xmath14 , and can be used for out - of - sample recipient - donor pair in order to assess the risk of a recipient s transplant operation .",
    "the problem of learning the predictive model @xmath15 from the labeled dataset @xmath7 is a standard supervised learning problem ( shalev - shwartz 2014 ) .",
    "the expected loss of a predictive model @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18 is a general loss function , and @xmath19 is the joint recipient - donor feature - label distribution , which is unknown to the clinicians .",
    "the optimal predictive model is defined as @xmath20 ; since @xmath19 is unknown , we can not directly find the optimal predictive model , and hence we resort to minimizing the empirical loss as measured over the training and validation sets .",
    "the empirical loss for the training set is defined as @xmath21 , and it can be defined similarly for the validation set .    note that as pointed out in the previous section , the optimal predictive model @xmath22 is likely to be of a very complex structure as it abstracts a complex medical concept , i.e. the interactions between the recipient and donor features and their effect on the transplant outcomes . a poor initial choice for the space of possible models @xmath23 , e.g. letting @xmath23 be a hypothesis class with a small vc dimension , may lead to a large bias in the loss function of @xmath22 , and hence we need a more versatile learning framework for which the complexity of the predictive model @xmath16 adapts to the complexity of the underlying medical concept being learned .",
    "confidentmatch adopts a novel framework for crafting complex predictive models out of simpler baseline models by creating a phenotypic characterization of the recipient - donor feature space in which separate predictive models are assigned to disjoint partitions of the feature space .",
    "that is , confidentmatch outputs a set of partitions that cover the entire recipient - donor feature space , together with a set of predictive models , each tailored to a given partition , thereby leading to an overall complex , granular predictive model .",
    "formally , we divide the recipient - donor feature space @xmath3 into @xmath1 disjoint subsets , where @xmath1 is to be determined based on the given dataset , in such a way that for each subset , we can have a separate optimal predictive model that minimizes the overall expected risk .",
    "we write @xmath24 to denote a partition of the feature space @xmath3 , where all such partitions are ensured to be disjoint and cover @xmath3 .",
    "the partition @xmath24 can be translated to a partitioning of the training set @xmath10 and validation set @xmath11 , i.e. the training set is partitioned as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "given the above construct , the learning problem becomes a problem of ( jointly ) finding the optimal partitioning @xmath24 of the recipient - donor feature space , together with the optimal predictive model @xmath27 associated with every partition @xmath28 , i.e. assuming that we know the distribution @xmath19 , the optimal predictive model is found by solving the following optimization problem @xmath29 \\bigg ] \\\\ & \\text{subject to } & \\mathcal{x } = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k \\mathcal{x}_i \\mbox { , and } \\mathcal{x}_i \\cap \\mathcal{x}_j = \\emptyset\\ ; \\forall i \\neq j. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we break down the problem in ( [ eq1 ] ) into two nested optimization problems ; we first focus on the solution of the inner optimization problem and define its solution ( for a given partitioning @xmath24 ) as @xmath30 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that given a partition @xmath31 , the solutions to the inner optimizations are separable , i.e. the optimal predictor of one partition can be determined independent of the choice of the predictors for the other partitions .",

    "<S> this paper proposes a novel system ( confidentmatch ) that is trained using data from electronic health records . </S>",
    "<S> confidentmatch predicts the success of an organ transplant ( in terms of the 3-year survival rates ) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the donor and recipient . </S>",
    "<S> confidentmatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and recipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and constructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the system controls the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows for assuring more granular and confident predictions for a larger number of potential recipient - donor pairs , thereby ensuring that predictions are  personalized \" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest possible granularity . </S>",
    "<S> experiments conducted on the unos heart transplant dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of confidentmatch to other competing benchmarks ; confidentmatch can provide predictions of success with 95@xmath0 confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients , which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark algorithm ( deepboost ) . </S>"
