    "it is widely believed that the luminosity of a type  ia supernova ( snia ) is due to the deposition of gamma - rays and positrons from the radioactive decay , @xmath0ni @xmath8 @xmath0co @xmath8 @xmath0fe , of @xmath0ni created in the explosion ( pankey 1962 ; colgate & mckee 1969 ) . given the central importance of this process",
    "it is surprising that only a couple of pieces of _ direct _ evidence in favour of a radioactively driven light curve have been presented .",
    "axelrod ( 1980a , b ) studied the [ co  iii ]  0.59  @xmath9 m feature in the type  ia sn  1972e , and found that its decline was consistent with @xmath0co decay .",
    "a similar result was obtained by kuchner _",
    "( 1994 ) who used optical spectra of a sample of type  ia sne to follow the co / fe mass ratio .",
    "both of these studies made use of optical spectroscopy of type  ia sne in their ` nebular ' or ` late - time ' phase . by this",
    ", we mean the era starting about 60  days post - maximum - light when the ejecta are optically thin to most of the infrared ( ir ) and optical lines .",
    "( throughout this paper , epochs are defined with respect to maximum light in the b - band , t@xmath10=0  days ) .",
    "nevertheless , some of the stronger optical lines can remain optically - thick for a significant time after the nebular phase begins .",
    "clumping can exacerbate this effect .",
    "in addition , the sheer number of strong lines in the optical region results in severe line blending , causing identification uncertainty and inaccurate flux measurement of individual lines . in particular , the identification and measurement of the [ co  iii ]  0.59  @xmath9 m line was vital for the work of axelrod and kuchner",
    "_ et al._. a concern about this identification was the extent of contamination by na  i  d. unfortunately , there are no other strong lines of na  i present in the optical spectra and so it was difficult to place an observational constraint on the strength of na  i  d. consequently , some doubt was expressed ( wheeler _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) as to the reliability of the 0.59  @xmath9 m feature as a direct test of the radioactive decay model .",
    "however , as kuchner _",
    "_ point out , it can be argued on theoretical grounds that significant na  i  d contamination is unlikely .",
    "hoyle & fowler ( 1960 ) proposed that a type ia supernova results from the explosion of a white dwarf due to the thermonuclear fusion to @xmath0ni of @xmath110.51  m@xmath12 of the nuclei suspended in the electron - degenerate gas .",
    "different classes of models which invoke this mechanism are the chandrasekhar - mass models ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1984 , nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 ; khokhlov 1991 ; woosley & weaver 1994a ) and sub - chandrasekhar - mass models ( livne 1990 ; livne & glasner 1990 ; woosley & weaver 1994b ; livne & arnett 1995 ; hflich & khokhlov 1995 ) .",
    "while all these models tend to eject 0.21.0  m@xmath12 of @xmath0ni , they nevertheless all have problems ( woosley & weaver 1994b ) .",
    "the thermonuclear explosion mechanism is challenged by s.  colgate and collaborators ( colgate _ et al .",
    "they favour instead a core - collapse model with low mass ejection ( @xmath130.1  m@xmath14 ) . the reason they advocate this hypothesis is due to apparent difficulties in accounting for the decline rates of the optical light curves at late times .",
    "as early as 100 days it is observed that the type  ia bvr fluxes decline with a faster time - scale than the 77  day half - life of @xmath0co . in both the thermonuclear and core - collapse scenarios ,",
    "this can be initially explained as being due to an increasing fraction of the gamma - rays escaping as the ejecta expand .",
    "eventually , however , the luminosity is driven predominantly by the positrons which are more easily absorbed than the gamma - rays ( positron emission occurs in 4% of the @xmath0co decays ) . in the thermonuclear case",
    ", the large ejecta mass ( @xmath111  m@xmath14 ) means that the positrons continue to be totally trapped , even after they dominate the luminosity .",
    "the fact that the light curve nonetheless continues to decline faster than the @xmath0co decay rate is explained as being due to an increasing fraction of the energy emerging at wavelengths longward of 2.5  @xmath9 m and so escaping detection .",
    "in particular , strong fine - structure lines of [ fe  ii ] and [ fe  iii ] in the 1530  @xmath9 m range are anticipated ( axelrod , 1980 ) .",
    "this crucial prediction has yet to be tested .",
    "as mentioned above , an alternative explanation is provided by the small ejecta mass ( @xmath110.1  m@xmath12 ) of the core - collapse model which results in a steadily increasing transparency to the positrons .    clearly , it is vital to establish the mass of @xmath0ni in the sn ejecta in order to distinguish between the thermonuclear and core - collapse explosion mechanisms .",
    "in particular , a conclusive test would be to determine the mass of iron in the ejecta at late times .",
    "such a measurement also holds out the prospect of distinguishing between specific thermonuclear models , although higher precision is probably needed here .",
    "the measurement of the absolute mass of ejected iron is difficult and has rarely been attempted .",
    "significant uncertainties exist in distance , atomic data , and ejecta conditions ( ionization , temperature , density ) .",
    "the first attempts were by meyerott ( 1980 ) and axelrod ( 1980a , b ) who inferred a substantial mass of ejected @xmath0ni from the forbidden iron lines in the optical spectra of the type  ia sn  1972e , although the aforementioned uncertainties meant that only a weak constraint on the mass ( 0.31.0m@xmath14 ) was achieved .",
    "more recently , spyromilio _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) used near - infrared ( nir ) and optical spectra of the _ peculiar _ type  ia sn  1991 t to deduce the presence of about 0.5  m@xmath12 of @xmath0fe in the ejecta but also with a large uncertainty ( 0.41.2m@xmath12 ) .",
    "ruiz - lapuente ( 1992 ) modelled the optical spectra of the _ peculiar _ type ia sn  1986 g and derived a @xmath0ni mass of about 0.4 m@xmath14 , although this too was subject to large uncertainties in the atomic data used .",
    "we conclude that the widespread belief in the standard type  ia scenario of a thermonuclear explosion and radioactively - driven light curve rests on remarkably little direct evidence . in order to place our understanding of snias on a more secure observational basis",
    "we have begun a programme of nir spectroscopy of a number of typical type  ia supernovae during the nebular phase .",
    "since the ejecta are optically thin , observation during this era offers the best prospects of measuring directly total relative and absolute masses . in the nebular phase we expect the ejecta to be cooled mainly through forbidden - line emission from singly- and doubly - ionized cobalt and iron atoms .",
    "observation in the nir region has a couple of advantages over the optical band .",
    "optical lines are generally of higher excitation and so are more temperature - sensitive . in addition",
    "the opacity of certain optical transitions are higher than those in the ir , and may even be optically thick , especially if the ejecta are clumped .",
    "the presence of forbidden nir lines of iron and cobalt in the type  ia nebular - phase spectra together with the advent of sensitive ir spectrographs , and significant improvements in the accuracy of atomic data ( hummer _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , offers the possibility of a powerful direct test of both the explosion mechanism and of the radioactive decay hypothesis .    to test for the presence of radioactive cobalt we use forbidden cobalt and iron lines and a simple spectral synthesis model to determine both the total cobalt / iron mass _ ratio _ and the absolute masses of cobalt and iron over a sequence of epochs .",
    "the determination of absolute mass is , in principle , subject to greater uncertainty owing to its sensitivity to distance and temperature errors .",
    "the ratio method was applied originally to the type  ii sn  1987a by varani",
    "_ et  al . _  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the technique exploits several interesting features of the cobalt - iron nebula which render it relatively insensitive to the details of the spectral synthesis code .",
    "firstly , the similar atomic configurations and thus excitation energies of iron and cobalt , plus the fact that if the iron and cobalt do arise from @xmath0ni decay then they should be spatially co - extensive in the ejecta , means that estimates of the _ ratios _ of masses of co@xmath15/fe@xmath15 or co@xmath16/fe@xmath16 are much less sensitive to temperature or temperature gradients than are absolute mass determinations ( varani _ et al .",
    "secondly , the first ionization potentials of iron and cobalt are virtually the same ( 7.9  ev for fe and 7.87  ev for co ) , and the second ionization potentials differ by only 5% ( 16.19  ev for fe and 17.08  ev for co ) ( fuhr , martin and wiese 1988 ) .",
    "consequently the individual mass ratios co@xmath15/fe@xmath15 or co@xmath16/fe@xmath16 derived from model spectral matches to the data should be equal to the total cobalt / iron mass ratio .",
    "thirdly , such ratios are largely unaffected by uncertainties in distance or extinction .",
    "this is particularly so for infrared lines where the extinction is lower .",
    "prior to this work , little was known about the nir behaviour of type  ia sne in the nebular phase .",
    "nir photometry in the 60100 day era ( elias _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 , 1985 ) revealed a strong flux - deficit in the j - band ( j  h@xmath11 + 1.5 ) .",
    "indeed , this deficit was present as early as 15  days .",

    "_ 1997 ) showed that the j ",
    "h reddening in the 1360  day era is due to the presence of a deep , wide flux deficit between 1.1 and 1.5  @xmath9 m .",
    "this deficit , originally suggested to be a broad absorption ( kirshner _ et al . _",
    "1973 ; elias _ et al . _ 1981 ; graham _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , has more recently been attributed to a lack of emission lines in that region ( spyromilio , pinto & eastman 1994 ; meikle _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    in this paper we present near - ir spectra of seven type  ia supernovae , namely sne  1986 g , 1991 t , 1992 g , 1994ae , 1995d , 1995al and 1996x .",
    "the 92 g , 94ae , 95al and 96x spectra are presented for the first time .",
    "these observations span epochs 13  days to 338  days , thus providing the most extensive temporal coverage ever achieved for type  ia sne nir spectra . while this work focuses on those spectra taken during the nebular phase only , for completeness we have also included several spectra taken during the earlier photospheric phases of some of these supernovae .",
    "type  ia nir spectra in the photospheric phase have already been presented and discussed by frogel _",

    "the sn  1986 g spectra were acquired with cgs2 at ukirt , while the day  60 spectrum of sn  1991 t was obtained with iris at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "all the other infrared spectra were acquired using the cooled grating spectrograph , cgs4 , at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) with the short focal length ( 150  mm ) camera and either the 75 or 150  l / mm grating .",
    "sky subtraction was achieved by nodding between two positions along the slit .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the cgs4dr ( daly 1996 ) and figaro ( shortridge 1995 ) packages . except where stated otherwise",
    ", the cgs4 wavelength calibration was with respect to krypton and argon arc lamps .",
    "where roughly contemporary optical spectra are available , these are shown in fig .",
    "the observing log for the optical spectra is given in table  3 .    since our aim was to simultaneously model contemporary nir _ and _ optical spectra , close attention was given to both relative and absolute fluxing .",
    "only for sn  1995d was there a sufficiently high signal - to - noise overlap in the optical and nir spectra ( 0.851.04  @xmath9 m ) to allow the relative fluxing to be directly checked .",
    "it was found that the total flux in the overlap range as measured from the nir and optical spectra differed by only 1% .",
    "this suggests not only that the relative fluxing was good but also , given that the nir and optical data were obtained at different times , at different sites and with different instruments , it gives us confidence about the quality of our absolute fluxing .",
    "all spectra were absolute flux - calibrated using flux standards .",
    "in addition , the fluxing was checked by comparing our observed spectral fluxes in the standard pass - bands with those derived by extrapolation from photometry , using type  ia light curves .",
    "fluxing in the optical band was checked by extrapolating early - epoch v - band photometry to the epochs of our observations , using the standard v - band light curve of doggett & branch ( 1985 ) .",
    "these magnitudes were then compared with our observed total spectral flux in a square passband spanning 0.50550.5945  @xmath9 m . for sn  1995d at 92  d and 1995al at 176  d the broadband flux obtained by extrapolation exceeded the observed total spectral flux by about 30% . for sn  1991 t ,",
    "the difference was less than 5% .",
    "absolute fluxing in the nir band was checked as follows .",
    "using ircam2 at ukirt , h- and k - band photometry of sn  1995al was obtained at 162  d. no nir light curves are available for this era and so we used the i - band light curve of schlegel ( 1995 ) to extrapolate to 94  d and 175  d. the extrapolated fluxes were then compared with the total observed spectral fluxes in square passbands spanning 1.451.85  @xmath9 m and 1.92.5  @xmath9 m .",
    "we found that the spectral fluxes tended to exceed the extrapolated broadband fluxes by about 15  % .",
    "for sn  1994ae at 174  d we followed a similar procedure , extrapolating from aat / iris h - photometry obtained at 120  days ( courtesy of j. spyromilio ) . in this case , the spectral flux was fainter than the extrapolated value by @xmath1140% , but the signal - to - noise is very low .",
    "for sn  1995d , no nir photometry was available .",
    "we therefore scaled the observed nir spectral flux by an amount equal to the difference in the peak v - magnitudes of sne  1995d and 1995al .",
    "this was then compared with the extrapolated h - band flux as for sn  1995al .",
    "we found the observed spectral flux was less than the extrapolated broadband value by 15% . only for the nir fluxing of sn  1991 t at 338",
    "d was a photometry check not possible due to the non - availability of reliable infrared light curves extending to such a late epoch .",
    "given that the square passbands we adopted only roughly approximate the shape of the photometry passbands used , we conclude that the agreement between the measured spectral fluxes and the extrapolated values is encouraging .",
    "it seems unlikely that the fluxing of either the optical or nir spectra was in error by more than @xmath1125% .",

    "many of the discrepancies in this region may well be due to the inaccurate a - values for doubly - ionised cobalt and for the [ fe  ii ]  a@xmath2 g term .",
    "another probable cause is the non - inclusion of intermediate - mass elements in the model such as silicon and magnesium . a third possibility is suggested by a preliminary calculation using a more complete model , which shows that the ion fraction of fe@xmath16/fe@xmath15 increases with radius .",
    "the total flux which results is the average over this distribution and may not be achievable from any single ionization ratio .",
    "a curious discrepancy is that emission in the 0.43 - 0.44  @xmath9 m region is underproduced by the model , with the shortfall worsening with time .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in the model fits of ruiz - lapuente ( 1992 ) for sn  1986 g at 257 , 296 and 323 days . using a more sophisticated model , liu ,",
    "jeffery & schultz ( 1997 ) also find this effect , although in their study it only becomes a problem at about 1  year .",
    "they suggest that by these late times a significant contribution to the fe  ii emission may come from the recombination or charge transfer cascades from fe@xmath16 .",
    "they also suggest time - dependent effects or emission from other species as alternative explanations .",
    "another interesting result from the model comparison is that strong observed features at 0.47  @xmath9 m and 0.589/0.591  @xmath9 m are blueshifted with respect to the model [ fe  iii ]  0.47  @xmath9 m and [ co  iii ]  0.589/0.591  @xmath9 m lines by @xmath113500  km / s and @xmath111500  km / s respectively .",
    "blueshifts of @xmath111000  km / s are also apparent for the features at 1.56 and 2.01  @xmath9 m .",
    "we note that the 89  d optical spectrum of sn  1994ae exhibits similar blueshifts to those seen in sn  1995d .    for sn  1995al at 94  d ( fig .",
    "7 ) only an infrared spectrum was available .",
    "in this case we were unable to pin down the electron temperature , ion density or ionization ratio .",

    "8 & 9 ) , the relatively low s / n and the smaller wavelength coverage in the nir ( fig .",
    "9 ) prompted us to use only the 149 day optical spectrum ( fig .",
    "8) , scaled to roughly match the epoch of the infrared spectrum , for determining the model parameters .",
    "the temperature was adjusted to provide a match to the observed [ co  iii]0.589/0.591  @xmath9m/[fe  iii]0.466/0.470  @xmath9 m flux ratio .",
    "the ionization ratio was then adjusted to match the [ fe  ii]0.716/0.717  @xmath9 m flux .",
    "the resulting nir spectrum was then compared with the data . given the low s / n in the nir ,",
    "the model is reasonably consistent with the observed nir spectrum of sn  1995al . nevertheless , there is still unexplained emission around 1.26  @xmath9 m and 1.65  @xmath9 m . in the optical region ,",
    "even allowing for the additional deliberate model match in the 0.716  @xmath9 m region , the match is significantly better than for the @xmath1190d spectra . in particular , the wavelength agreement of the strong 0.47  @xmath9 m and 0.59  @xmath9 m features with the model is much better than for sn  1995d at 92  d. there is no evidence of a blueshift in the 0.59  @xmath9 m feature , while at 0.47  @xmath9 m the shift is less than @xmath111000  km / s .",
    "unfortunately we do not have an earlier optical spectrum for sn  1995al to compare with the @xmath1190  d sn  1995d and sn  1994ae spectra .    for sn  1994ae at 175  d ( fig .",
    "10 ) only an infrared spectrum was available .",
    "therefore a similar approach was adopted as for sn  1995al at 94d , using the same electron temperature as for sn  1995al at 176  d. the greater uncertainty in the model parameters due to the lack of an optical spectrum , was worsened by the very low s / n of the nir spectrum , even after binning by a factor of four .",

    "firstly , for each supernova we made an independent estimate of the atomic density by distributing 1  m@xmath12 of iron - group elements throughout a sphere defined by the maximum velocity and epoch .",
    "we found that the atomic densities derived in this way agreed to within a factor of three of the total densities obtained from the spectral models .    secondly , the heating and cooling rates of the gas were compared .",
    "energy is deposited in the ejecta by the decay of @xmath0co at a rate of    @xmath30    where t is the time in days after the explosion and f is the fraction of @xmath31-rays absorbed ( axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "f varies as t@xmath32 so that we would expect f - values of @xmath330.5 at 3 months and @xmath110.1 at 6  months to a year for",
    "the supernovae studied .",
    "we compared predicted heating rates with the three cases for which we have both optical and nir spectra .",
    "we find that the observed total optical+nir luminosities correspond to cooling rates about a factor of two below the heating rates . given that , in each case",
    ", only part of the total supernova spectrum was used we conclude that the predicted heating rates were in reasonable agreement with the cooling rates .",
    "we find that a spectral model based on @xmath0co - decay can be adjusted to reproduce several of the prominent features in the nir and optical spectra of type  ia supernovae at three distinctly different epochs ( 3 , 6 and 11 months ) . at 3 and 6  months ,",
    "feature identifications include [ co  iii]0.589 , 0.591  @xmath9 m , [ co  iii]2.002  @xmath9 m , [ co  ii]1.547  @xmath9m[co  iii]1.549  @xmath9 m , [ fe  iii]0.466 , 0.470  @xmath9 m , while at 11 months [ fe  ii]0.717 , [ fe  ii]1.257 and [ fe  ii]1.644  @xmath9 m are prominent . plausible temperatures and densities",
    "are also found ( cf .",
    "axelrod 1980 ) .",
    "there does exist some unexplained emission in the j and h  windows in the 36 month period .",
    "however , the fact that this does not occur at 1  year indicates that the problem may lie with the modelling of the cobalt lines which contribute significantly at the earlier epochs .",
    "we suspect that inaccuracies in the atomic data for cobalt may be at least part of the problem .",
    "as pointed out earlier , there is a possibility that na  i  d contributes to the 0.59  @xmath9 m feature .",
    "since our wavelength coverage extends into the nir we are able to use na  i 2.21  @xmath9 m to estimate the strength of na  i  d. for lte conditions at a temperature of @xmath117000  k we would expect na  i 2.21  @xmath9 m to have a flux level of @xmath113% of na  i  d. for sn  1995d , the flux around 2.2  @xmath9",
    "m has a flux of about 1% that of the 0.59  @xmath9 m feature . while this does not rule out the presence of na  i  d in the 0.59  @xmath9 m feature",
    ", it does seem unlikely that it could be the dominant contributor .",
    "we also note that in our model fitting we found no need for the addition of sodium to improve the match .",
    "while encouraging , these results alone do not rule out the possibility that a similar success could be achieved with a completely different model having the requisite number of freely - adjustable parameters .",
    "however , having adjusted our model to match the above specific features , we find that a number of other spectral lines are also successfully explained , particularly in the nir .",
    "these are [ co  iii]1.742/1.764  @xmath9 m , [ fe  iii]2.146  @xmath9 m and [ fe  iii]2.243  @xmath9 m .",
    "the ability of our model to _ predict _ these other features gives us added confidence in the appropriateness of the @xmath0co - decay hypothesis .    in spite of the relative success of the @xmath0ni - based model in reproducing much of the observed nir and optical nebular spectra , it is important to check the range of cobalt - to - iron mass ratios which uncertainties in the observed spectra , atomic data and distances would allow . at our earliest phase ( @xmath113  months ) , the electron density is above the critical value ( i.e. the electrons are in lte ) and yet the lines have become optically thin .",
    "consequently , as explained above , derived mass ratios are distance independent .",
    "however , a - value uncertainty is still important .",
    "the mass ratio for a particular degree of ionization under lte conditions can be expressed analytically as :    @xmath34    where co@xmath35 and fe@xmath35 indicate ions of the same degrees of ionization , i is the line flux , @xmath36 the transition wavelength , a the einstein a - value , g the statistical weight , e the upper level energy , z the partition function , m the atomic mass and the subscripts ji and ji represent the transitions in the relevant cobalt and iron ion lines respectively . at later epochs the spectrum is produced under increasingly non  lte conditions . in general , this means that the derived mass ratio is sensitive to uncertainties in both a - values and collision strengths , as well as ( to a lesser extent ) distance , as explained above . in this regime , we do not have a simple analytical expression for the mass ratios .",
    "for both lte and non - lte conditions , to determine the effects of our imprecise knowledge of the atomic data we assumed gaussian distributions in their uncertainties and used a monte carlo simulation to find the range of mass ratios for which a match to the observed spectra was still obtainable .",
    "a change in temperature will also produce a change in the mass ratio .",
    "the effect is strongest in the boltzmann factor , producing around @xmath2810% in the mass ratio for @xmath37t=@xmath28500k , which is the typical temperature range that the model fits permit .",
    "the partition functions are also sensitive to temperature , but their _ ratios _ are much less sensitive , typically remaining within @xmath285% for @xmath37t=@xmath281000k . in addition",
    ", distance uncertainty can have a small influence on the mass ratio for non - lte conditions .",
    "taking these various effects into account , we find that the values of m@xmath38/m@xmath39 are uncertain by factors of @xmath111.5 to @xmath114 depending on the availability and quality of the data .",
    "these ranges are shown in table  9 .",
    "we also used the model fits to estimate the _ absolute _ masses of @xmath0ni produced in each supernova . in table  10",
    "we present the masses of the individual species , together with the total mass of @xmath0ni obtained by summing the singly- and doubly - ionized iron and cobalt .",
    "we include upper limits for neutral iron and cobalt .",
    "the neutral iron limit was estimated from the region of the h - band which covers part of the [ fe  i]1.443  @xmath9 m feature .",
    "the neutral cobalt limit was then derived assuming the same ionization fraction and the radioactive decay mass ratio .",
    "we find that the contribution of neutral cobalt and iron to the total iron - group mass is generally less than 15% . in the case of sn  1995al at + 176 days",
    "the h - band spectrum does not extend far enough blueward to allow us to place an upper limit on neutral iron and cobalt .",
    "unfortunately , triply - ionized cobalt or iron do not produce any prominent emission lines in the nir or optical region and so a significant mass of either can not be ruled out by the data .",
    "axelrod ( 1980 ) estimates that the contribution of triply - ionized material could be about 10% of the total mass at 3  months rising to @xmath1125% at 6  months and @xmath1140% at one year .",
    "these estimates are therefore also included in table  10 . however , the values for the total @xmath0ni mass shown in table  10 are conservative as they are obtained by summing the singly- and doubly - ionized iron and cobalt only .    as with the mass ratio study , absolute mass determination is subject to atomic data uncertainty . in general , however , it is more sensitive to temperature , distance and extinction uncertainty .",
    "the effect of all these uncertainties is that the derived masses are uncertain by factors of @xmath111.5 to @xmath114 , again depending on the availability and quality of the data ( see table 10 ) .",
    "we note that the level of uncertainty in the mass _ ratio _ estimates is not significantly less than this , in spite of their lower sensitivity to distance and temperature errors .",
    "this is because the atomic data uncertainties , dominate the overall error for both the relative and absolute masses .    for sne  1991 t , 1995d and 1995al",
    "our estimates for the total @xmath0ni mass of all four ionization states are in the range 0.370.90  m@xmath14 .",
    "if we confine our mass estimate to the directly measured singly- and doubly - ionized species only , the mass is 0.270.67m@xmath12 . the total @xmath0ni mass for sn  1994ae is found to be only about 0.2  m@xmath14 but it must be remembered that the data in this case are of very low signal - to - noise .",
    "and at least twice this amount is possible .",
    "thus , in spite of the uncertainties , the values found point towards the ejection of substantial masses of @xmath0ni , and so support the basic thermonuclear scenario .",
    "in this paper we have presented the most extensive nir spectral coverage hitherto of type  ia supernovae , spanning 13 to 338  days after maximum blue light . in some cases ,",
    "contemporary or near - contemporary optical spectra were also shown .",
    "the nir spectra are highly structured throughout the j- , h- and k - bands . in particular , all nine spectra in the 13 to 176  day era show a characteristically steep decline in the @xmath111.021.13  @xmath9 m region , while all seven spectra taken between 13 and 94  days show a sharp rise at @xmath111.50  @xmath9 m .",
    "we conclude that the 1.131.50  @xmath9 m deficit is responsible for the red colour for the entire period from 13 to at least 94  days .",
    "comparison of the nebular - phase spectra with a simple non - lte spectral model based on @xmath0ni - decay abundances , indicates that significant fractions of both the nir and optical spectra are made up of iron and cobalt lines .",
    "singly - ionized sulphur also contributes strongly to the emission around 1  @xmath9 m . we conclude that the 1.13 - 1.50  @xmath9 m deficit is due to a lack of emission lines from species which dominate the rest of the ir / optical spectrum , as originally proposed by spyromilio , pinto and eastman ( 1994 ) . identified nir features include [ fe  ii]1.257  @xmath9 m , [ fe  i]1.443  @xmath9 m , [ co  ii]1.547  @xmath9m[co  iii]1.549  @xmath9 m , [ fe  ii]1.644  @xmath9 m , [ co  iii]1.7421.764  @xmath9 m , [ co  iii]2.002  @xmath9 m , [ fe  iii]2.146  @xmath9 m and [ fe  iii]2.243  @xmath9 m .",
    "failure to account for some of the nir emission in the 36 month period may be partly due to inadequate atomic data for cobalt .    the model comparison for sn  1995d at 92  d revealed blueshifts in the features at 0.47  @xmath9 m , 0.589/0.591  @xmath9 m , 1.56  @xmath9 m and 2.01  @xmath9 m .",
    "similar shifts were seen in the optical spectrum of sn  1994ae at 89  d. however , for the 94  d nir spectrum and 149  d optical spectrum of sn  1995al , the blueshifts were much smaller or non - existent . at later epochs the blueshifts diminished or disappeared altogether .",
    "the fact that the sn  1995d blueshifts occurred at several places over the entire nir - optical spectrum tends to argue against blending with unidentified lines as the general cause , although this may be a partial explanation for the larger blueshift at 0.47  @xmath9 m .",
    "in addition , all the model lines are optically thin and so the effect can not be simply one of optical depth in a homogeneous medium .",
    "we therefore suggest the ejecta are actually inhomogeneous and that the blueshifts are due to density enhancements which are optically thick .",
    "some support for this is provided by the fact that small or no blueshifts were seen at 6 and 11  months .",
    "our @xmath0ni - based model , using plausible temperatures and densities , both accounts for and predicts features in the nir and optical regions .",
    "in particular it shows that the cobalt lines decay with time relative to the iron lines and that this is due to the decline in the abundance of cobalt at the @xmath0co - decay rate .",
    "this gives us confidence in the appropriateness of the @xmath0ni - decay light - curve hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , there are important discrepancies between the model predictions and the observations .",
    "this is probably due to a combination of unidentified lines , inaccurate atomic data , and the use of a simple spectral model . in spite of the large uncertainties in various parameters ,",
    "_ we nevertheless conclude that the mass of ejected @xmath0ni is large . _",
    "we believe that , on balance , our results support the basic thermonuclear explosion scenario and argue against the core - collapse model of colgate _",
    "( 1997 ) , at least for most type  ia supernovae .",
    "the range of values encompasses predictions of white - dwarf - merger , delayed - detonation and sub - chandrasekhar mass models .",
    "the work presented here is only a first attempt to describe and interpret the late - time nir behaviour of type  ia supernovae .",
    "compared with the optical band , the quantity and quality of spectra are still much inferior .",
    "however , the introduction of more sensitive nir detectors coupled with adaptive optics means that rapid improvement in data quality can be anticipated in the near future .",
    "indeed it may become possible to detect the presence of other radioactive isotopes such as @xmath40co ( _ cf _ varani et al .",
    "the development and application of more self - consistent and comprehensive spectral synthesis codes such as eddington ( eastman & pinto 1993 ) coupled with our steadily improving knowledge of the distance scale out to @xmath1150  mpc will lead to elucidation of the appropriate thermonuclear explosion model .",
    "however , this will not be possible if better atomic data does not become available .",
    "this is the key improvement required for the field to progress . +",
