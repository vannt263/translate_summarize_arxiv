    ", we will focus on the agn rlfs .    in an actual survey , only a very limited number of objects in the universe can be observed .",
    "how many sources entering the sample depends on the survey depth and selection function .",
    "thus the estimation of lfs is inevitably based on a truncated sample of objects .",
    "another difficulty is brought about by @xmath0-correction .",
    "it not only affects the accurate determination of intrinsic luminosity of individual sources , but also complicates the process of translating flux selection limits into luminosity selection limits , even for a single band selected survey @xcite .",
    "the truncation boundary on the @xmath1 plane of a real sample is often a complicated region , but not a regular curve .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-correction can affect the estimation of lfs by making it difficult to define the truncation boundary .",
    "for example , @xcite found that a wide range of @xmath0-corrections being applied across different galaxy types can bias the shape of the global lf .",
    "for the radio agns , their spectra are frequently characterized as a simple power - law , @xmath4 , and the @xmath0-correction has a simple form of @xmath5 .",
    "then the @xmath0-corrections of radio sources can be represented by their spectral properties ( include spectral curvature , spectral index @xmath6 and its distribution ) .",
    "several authors have discussed the potential problem of spectral curvature and its effect on obtaining reliable k - corrections for distant flat - spectrum radio sources and also for steep - spectrum sources @xcite .",
    "particularly , @xcite highlighted the effect of spectral curvature that removes the evidence for the rapid decline in number density at high redshift suggested by @xcite , and suggested that curvature would need to be incorporated in a full analysis of the rlf .",
    "nevertheless , a recent study of @xcite pointed out that the effect of curvature only becomes important at higher frequencies ( @xmath7 ) and it can be avoided by measuring the spectra at lower frequencies . in the same paper , @xcite also highlighted the importance of a distribution in spectral index in the parametric modeling of rlf ( also see * ? ? ? * ) . in this work",
    ", we analyze the bias caused by traditional bivariate rlf estimators based on monte carlo simulations , and further prove the necessity of incorporating the spectral index distribution into the rlf calculation .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a lambda cold dark matter cosmology with the parameters @xmath8 = 0.27 , @xmath9 = 0.73 , and @xmath10 = 71 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the procedure of our method is summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , simulated samples of radio agns are generated by the monte carlo method at given input rlfs .",
    "then the traditional bivariate rlf estimators and a trivariate estimator that considers the spectral index distribution are respectively used to estimate the rlfs based on the simulated samples .",
    "finally , the estimated rlfs are compared with the input rlfs to quantify the effect of spectral index distribution on estimating the rlf .      to begin with",
    ", we need to define a trivariate rlf in which the distribution of spectral index is incorporated .",
    "it is defined as the number of sources per comoving volume @xmath12 with radio luminosities in the range @xmath13 , and with spectral indexes in the range @xmath14 .",

    "the function @xmath24 is the intrinsic spectral index distribution .",
    "@xmath2 is related to the probability distribution of @xmath25 by    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the total number of sources in unit solid angle in the universe , and is given by the integral of @xmath28 over @xmath6 , @xmath29 and @xmath12 .",

    "we can obtain random draws of ( @xmath31 ) as follows :    1 .",
    "we first draw a random value of @xmath45 from the spectral index distribution @xmath24 , and then draw a random value of @xmath46 from its marginal distribution @xmath47 , which is given by the integral of equation ( 3 ) over @xmath6 and @xmath29 . a random value of @xmath48 is then drew from the conditional distribution @xmath49 .",

    "now we will investigate how accurate estimation can these traditional methods give for the input rlf defined in section 2.2 .",

    "generally , the @xmath64 and 2d mle methods give biased estimation , and the bias increases towards high redshift .",
    "this is because the @xmath0-correction increases with redshift .",
    "the bias is especially pronounced for flat - spectrum populations whose spectral index distribution is more scattered .",
    "the @xmath64 estimator is prone to underestimate the faint end rlf and produce an artificial redshift - related flattening or break , giving an impression of luminosity - dependent evolution .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath64 estimator can give a good estimation for local rlf ( see the redshift bin @xmath98 ) .",
    "the 2d mle method can give a relatively good estimation to the steep - spectrum rlf , while it only give a poor approximation to the flat - spectrum rlf .",
    "we also find that the 2d mle result closely depends on the choice of flux limit line that is a function of @xmath6 and redshift .",
    "by contrast , the 3d mle method can give an excellent estimation for both the steep- and flat - spectrum rlfs .",
    "a second presentation of the rlf data is given in figure [ rlf - z ] , in which space densities are plotted as a function of redshift for four ranges of intrinsic power .",
    "the @xmath64 estimated rlfs are shown as colored points with poisson errors , and the 2d mle result is shown as green bands with 2@xmath63 uncertainties .",
    "the dashed lines represent the input model rlfs taking values of @xmath99 .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the @xmath64 estimator always give an artificial luminosity - dependent decline of space density ( known as redshift cut - off in the literature ) for bins near the flux cutoff of the sample .",
    "our input model rlf indeed advocates a luminosity - dependent evolution where the low - luminosity radio sources experience weak evolution to @xmath100 1 , while the high - luminosity radio sources undergo strong evolution to @xmath101 .",
    "however , the @xmath64 estimator obviously exaggerate the significance / degree of this luminosity - dependent evolution , producing an impression that the space density of the powerful sources peaks at higher redshift than that of their weaker counterparts .",

    "the @xmath64 estimated rlfs are shown as colored points with poisson errors for four power ranges , @xmath65 , and @xmath66.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "it is found that the bivariate rlf estimators can cause significant bias .",
    "the primary reason is that in the analysis process of bivariate rlf estimators , the effect of spectral index distribution is not sufficiently considered . in a real radio survey ,",
    "one often make great efforts to construct a so - called  flux - limited complete \" sample . in fact , one also potentially attach a spectral index selection criterion to the final sample .",
    "take the steep - spectrum sample for example , only the sources with spectral index ( @xmath40 ) are selected into the final sample .",
    "thus the selection function of radio sample is actually a two - dimensional surface defined as @xmath102 in the @xmath103 space .",
    "the robustness of a lf estimator depends on how accurately it can deal with the selection function ( or referred as boundary condition ) of the truncated data . due to the intrinsic scatter of spectral index as well as the fact that @xmath0-correction is a function of both spectral index and redshift , the truncation boundary on the @xmath1 plane of sample is complicated .",
    "the traditional bivariate rlf estimators have difficulty in dealing with this boundary condition properly .",
    "the 2d mle simply treat the boundary condition as a one - dimensional curve but not a two - dimensional surface . for the @xmath64 estimator",
    ", it does not stick to a single survey - limit line in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "it calculate the accessible volume @xmath104 using the spectral properties of each source individually .",
    "however , this process can neither guarantee that the boundary condition is properly treated .",
    "thus we suggest that a feasible way to get a robust rlf estimation is incorporating the spectral index distribution into the analysis process .    from figure 1 , it is clear that sources near the flux limit become sparse for both the steep- and flat - spectrum samples .",
    "this is not a real decline of density , but just a result of selection effect .",
    "a bivariate rlf estimator may fail to properly account for this selection effect , and regard the sparseness as a real decline in density .",
    "the situation is especially severe for the flat - spectrum radio sources just because their spectral index distribution is more scattered .",
    "this may partly explain why a sharp redshift cut - off is easier to observed in the flat - spectrum rlfs , while in the steep - spectrum rlfs it still has much controversy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , for the flat - spectrum population , it particularly need to incorporate the spectral index distribution into the analysis process to get a robust rlf estimation .",
    "generally , methods of estimating lfs can be classified into nonparametric- and parametric estimators .",
    "the nonparametric method constructs the lfs directly from the data and makes no assumptions about the form of the lfs .",
    "however , the traditional nonparametric methods are not good at treating the truncation boundary , especially when the spectral index distribution is incorporated and the estimation becomes a trivariate density estimation problem .",
    "what s more , multiple samples from different surveys with different flux limits are usually combined together to determining the lfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this case further complicates the process because there exist multiple truncation boundaries . it is easier for the parametric estimators to consider the truncation boundaries , even if for a trivariate density estimation problem",
    "however , the parametric estimators need to assume a particular analytical form for the lfs .",
    "this is not an easy task , especially in the absence of any guidance from astrophysical theory .",
    "notably , in recent years some more rigorous approaches , such as a powerful semi - parametric approach @xcite and a bayesian approach @xcite have been proposed . nevertheless ,",
    "although powerful , these methods are bivariate estimators .",
    "they need to be developed to be competent to solve the trivariate density estimation problem",
    ". this will be the subject of our future work .      in order to rule out the possibility that our input rlf is too special to make the bivariate rlf estimator produce bias , we need to perform more simulation based on other input rlfs . for example , figure",
    "[ ple ] shows the result of another simulation in which the input rlf is modeled as a pure luminosity evolution .",
    "again , the @xmath64 estimator give an artificial luminosity - dependent decline of space density , exaggerating the significance of luminosity - dependent evolution .",
    "in recent years , researches have suggested that the position of rlf peak is luminosity dependent , being interpreted as a sign of cosmic downsizing .",
    "this work is not against the robustness of luminosity - dependent evolution in agn rlfs .",
    "but for some previous results , which are based on bivariate rlf estimators and did not sufficiently consider the effect of spectral index distribution , we do worry there is a risk that the significance / degree of luminosity - dependent evolution should be more or less magnified .",
    "the main results of this work are as follows :    1 .   based on a monte carlo method",
    ", we find that the traditional bivariate rlf estimators can cause bias in varying degree .",
    "the bias is especially pronounced for the flat - spectrum radio sources whose spectral index distribution is more scattered .",
    "the bias is caused because the @xmath0-corrections complicate the truncation boundary on the @xmath1 plane of the sample , but the traditional bivariate rlf estimators have difficulty in dealing with this boundary condition properly .",
    "we suggest that the spectral index distribution should be incorporated into the rlf analysis process to obtain a robust estimation . 2 .",
    "the classical nonparametric @xmath64 estimator can produce an artificial luminosity - dependent decline of space density for bins near the flux cutoff of the sample . as a result of this distortion to the true rlf ,",
