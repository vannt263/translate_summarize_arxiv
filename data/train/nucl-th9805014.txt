    "the role of strangeness in low and medium energy nuclear physics is currently of considerable interest , as it has the potential to deepen our understanding of the relevant strong interaction mechanisms in the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "for example , the system of a strange baryon ( hyperon @xmath0 ) and a nucleon ( @xmath1 ) is in principle an ideal testing ground for investigating the importance of su(3)@xmath2 symmetry in hadronic interactions .",
    "existing meson exchange models of the @xmath3 force usually assume su(3 ) flavor symmetry for the hadronic coupling constants , and in some cases @xcite even the su(6 ) symmetry of the quark model .",
    "the symmetry requirements provide relations between couplings of mesons of a given multiplet to the baryon current , which greatly reduce the number of free model parameters .",
    "specifically , coupling constants at the strange vertices are then connected to nucleon - nucleon - meson coupling constants , which in turn are constrained by the wealth of empirical information on @xmath4 scattering .",
    "essentially all these @xmath3 interaction models can reproduce the existing @xmath3 scattering data , so that at present the assumption of su(3 ) symmetry for the coupling constants can not be ruled out by experiment .",
    "one should note , however , that the various models differ dramatically in the treatment of the scalar - isoscalar meson sector , which describes the baryon - baryon interaction at intermediate ranges .",
    "for example , the nijmegen group @xcite views this interaction as being generated by genuine scalar meson exchange . in their model d @xcite an @xmath5",
    "is exchanged as an su(3)@xmath6 singlet . in models f  @xcite and nsc  @xcite , a scalar su(3 ) nonet is exchanged  namely , two isospin-0 mesons ( besides the @xmath5 , the @xmath7 in model f and @xmath8 in model nsc ) , an isospin-1 meson @xmath9 and an isospin-1/2 strange meson @xmath10 . the tbingen model @xcite , on the other hand , which is essentially a constituent quark model supplemented by @xmath11 and @xmath12 exchange at intermediate and short ranges , treats the @xmath12 meson as an su(3 ) singlet with a mass of 520 mev .    in the ( full )",
    "bonn @xmath4 potential  @xcite the intermediate range attraction is provided by uncorrelated and correlated @xmath13 exchange processes ( figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)(b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , respectively ) , with @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 intermediate states . from earlier studies of the @xmath13 interaction",
    "it is known that @xmath13 correlations are important mainly in the scalar - isoscalar and vector - isovector channels . in one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials these",
    "are included effectively via exchange of sharp mass @xmath12 and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "one disadvantage of such a simplified treatment is that this parameterization can not be transferred into the hyperon sector in a well defined manner .",
    "therefore in the earlier @xmath3 interaction models of the jlich group  @xcite , which start from the bonn @xmath4 potential , the coupling constants of the fictitious @xmath12 meson at the strange vertices ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) are free parameters  a rather unsatisfactory feature of the models .",
    "this is especially true for the extension to the strangeness @xmath19 channels , interest in which initiated with the prediction of the h - dibaryon by jaffe  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , so far there is no empirical information about these channels .",
    "these problems can be overcome by an explicit evaluation of correlated @xmath13 exchange in the various baryon - baryon channels .",
    "a corresponding calculation was already done for the @xmath4 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) in ref .",
    "the starting point there was a field theoretic model for both the @xmath20 born amplitudes and the @xmath13 and @xmath21 elastic scattering  @xcite . with the help of unitarity and dispersion relations the amplitude for the correlated @xmath13 exchange in the @xmath4 interaction was computed , showing characteristic discrepancies with the @xmath12 and @xmath16 exchange in the ( full ) bonn potential .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite the jlich group presented a microscopic derivation of correlated @xmath13 exchange in various baryon - baryon ( @xmath22 ) channels with strangeness @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath21 channel is treated on an equal footing with the @xmath13 channel in order to reliably determine the influence of @xmath21 correlations in the relevant @xmath25-channels . in this approach",
    "one can replace the phenomenological @xmath12 and @xmath16 exchanges in the bonn @xmath4 @xcite and jlich @xmath3 @xcite models by correlated processes , and eliminate undetermined parameters such as the @xmath26 coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the resulting models thus have more predictive power and should allow a more reliable treatment of the @xmath19 baryon - baryon channels .",
    "4.3 cm    in the next section we describe the basic ingredients used to derive correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange potentials for the baryon ",
    "baryon amplitudes in the @xmath12 and @xmath16 channels .",
    "we also give a short outline of the microscopic model for the required @xmath27 amplitudes .",
    "the results for the potentials are presented in section 3 , where we focus on the @xmath13 correlations in the @xmath12 channel .",
    "these are compared with the results obtained from the exchange of a sharp mass @xmath12 meson in the bonn @xmath4 @xcite and jlich @xmath3 @xcite potentials .",
    "furthermore , we introduce and discuss results obtained with a parameterization of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange potentials by an effective @xmath12 exchange for the @xmath4 and @xmath3 channels . finally , some concluding remarks are made in section 4 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a graphic representation of our dynamical model for correlated @xmath28 exchange . here",
    "@xmath29 stands for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32/@xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the basic ingredients are the @xmath35 , @xmath21 born amplitudes and the @xmath13-@xmath21 interaction , which we outline below . note that a microscopic model of correlated @xmath13 exchange for the @xmath4 case was already presented in ref .",
    "interestingly enough , the resulting strength turned out to be considerably larger than that from sharp mass @xmath36 and @xmath16 exchanges used in the ( full ) bonn potential @xcite .",
    "the dynamical model used here is based on the meson exchange framework of refs . @xcite involving the @xmath13 and @xmath21 coupled channels .",
    "the driving terms for @xmath37 consist of exchange and pole diagrams ( fig .",

    "the bare parameters ( masses , coupling constants ) in the pole diagrams are dressed by unitarizing the interaction terms in a relativistic schrdinger equation . the @xmath43 interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , third diagram ) is strongly isospin dependent : in the scalar - isoscalar channel all contributions ( @xmath16 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) add up and provide a sizable attraction , which leads to a @xmath21 bound state at @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the resulting phase shifts )  the genuine scalar resonance @xmath47 sits at a higher energy , at about 1.4 gev . on the other hand , in the vector - isovector channel",
    "there is strong cancellation between @xmath16 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 exchange , since the former changes sign .",
    "consequently , the influence of the @xmath21 channel here is negligible .",
    "the corresponding phase shift is dominated by the @xmath16-pole diagram , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .      based on the @xmath37 amplitude ( which has a",
    "well defined off - shell behavior ) the evaluation of diagrams such as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) for any @xmath22 system can be done in two steps .",
    "firstly the @xmath49 amplitudes ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) are determined in the pseudophysical region ( @xmath50 ) . for the transition born amplitude , @xmath51 ,",
    "both the @xmath1 and @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in case of @xmath56 ) exchanges are taken into account .",
    "corresponding coupling constants in the transition interaction are taken from the bonn @xmath4 @xcite and the jlich @xmath3 potential models @xcite .",
    "note that this can not be done for the cutoff masses at the vertices since the form factors now act in quite a different kinematic regime , where the baryon is the essential off - shell particle .",
    "for the @xmath4 case , the parameters can be fixed independently ( to @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev ) by using quasi - empirical information obtained by hhler at el .",
    "@xcite by analytically continuing the @xmath59 and @xmath60 scattering data . such information is , however , not available for the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) channels , so that here we make the reasonable assumption that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "from the @xmath65 helicity amplitudes the spectral functions can be calculated ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , which are then inserted into dispersion integrals to obtain the ( on - shell ) baryon - baryon interaction : @xmath66    we should note that the helicity amplitudes obtained according to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] still generate the uncorrelated ( first diagram on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , as well as the correlated pieces ( second and third diagrams ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the contribution of the truely correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange we must eliminate the former from the spectral function .",
    "this can be done by calculating the spectral function generated by the born term and subtracting it from the total spectral function : @xmath67    note that the spectral functions characterize both the strength and range of the interaction .",
    "clearly , for sharp mass exchanges the spectral function becomes a @xmath9-function at the appropriate mass .",
    "it is convenient to present our results in terms of effective coupling strengths , by parameterizing the correlated processes by ( sharp mass ) @xmath12 and @xmath16 exchanges .",
    "the interaction potential resulting from the exchange of a @xmath12 meson with mass @xmath68 between two @xmath69 baryons @xmath70 and @xmath71 has the structure : @xmath72 where a form factor @xmath73 is applied at each vertex , taking into account the fact that the exchanged @xmath12 meson is not on its mass shell .",
    "this form factor is parameterized in the conventional monopole form , @xmath74 with a cutoff mass @xmath75 assumed to be the same for both vertices .",
    "the correlated potential as given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can now be parameterized in terms of @xmath25-dependent strength functions @xmath76 , so that for the @xmath12 case : @xmath77 the effective coupling constants are then defined as : @xmath78 similar relations can be also derived for the correlated exchange in the isovector - vector channel @xcite , which in this case will involve vector as well as tensor coupling pieces .",
    "we stress once more that this parameterization does not involve any approximations as long as the full @xmath25-dependence of the effective coupling strengths is taken into account .",
    "the parameters of @xmath12 and @xmath16 exchange are chosen to have the same values in all particle channels .",
    "the masses @xmath68 and @xmath79 of the exchanged particles have been set to the values used in the bonn - jlich models of the @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath3  @xcite interactions ,   @xmath80 mev , @xmath81 mev .",
    "the cutoff masses @xmath82 and @xmath83 have been chosen so that the coupling strengths in the @xmath23 baryon - baryon channels vary only weakly with @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting values ( @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 gev ) are quite large compared to the values of the phenomenological parameterizations used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and thus represent rather hard form factors .",
    "note that in the obe framework the three reactions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 are determined by two parameters ( coupling constants ) @xmath89 and @xmath90 , whereas the correlated exchanges are characterized by three independent strength functions , so that vertex coupling constants can not be determined uniquely .    in the physical region",
    "the strength of the contributions is to a large extent governed by the value of @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "the values for the various channels are shown in table [ tab:5_6_10 ] .",
    "apart from the values for our full model , table 1 contains results obtained when uncorrelated contributions involving spin-1/2 baryons only are subtracted from the spectral function of the invariant baryon - baryon amplitudes .",
    "these are the proper values to be used for constructing a @xmath4 or @xmath3 model based on simple obe - exchange diagrams . for the full bonn @xmath4 model , contributions involving",
    "spin-3/2 baryons also need to be subtracted , since the corresponding contributions are already treated explicitly in this model , namely via box diagrams with intermediate @xmath52-states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . obviously processes involving spin-3/2 baryons increase the correlated contribution , in practice by about 30% in all channels .    comparing the relative strengths of effective @xmath12 exchange in the various baryon - baryon channels",
    ", one observes that the scalar - isoscalar part of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange in the @xmath4 channel is about twice as large as in both @xmath3 channels , and 3  4 times larger than in the @xmath19 channels .",
    "@xmath93    the average size of the effective coupling strengths is only an approximate measure of the strength of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange in the various particle channels .",
    "the precise energy dependence of the correlated exchange as well as its relative strength in the different partial waves of the @xmath94-channel reaction is determined by the spectrum of exchanged invariant masses , or spectral functions , leading to a different @xmath25-dependence of the effective coupling strengths . to demonstrate this we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:5_6_3 ] the on - shell @xmath4 potentials in spin - singlet states with angular momentum @xmath95 and 4 , which are generated directly by the scalar - isoscalar part of the correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange .",
    "as expected it is attractive throughout .",
    "figure [ fig:5_6_3 ] shows that the results evaluated from the microscopic correlated @xmath28 exchange model ( solid curves ) are comparable to those of the @xmath12 exchange in the bonn obept potential ( dashed curves ) in partial waves with @xmath96 .",
    "however , the correlated @xmath28 exchange is significantly stronger in high partial waves because the @xmath12 exchange , which corresponds to a spectral function proportional to @xmath97 , does not contain the long - range part of the correlated processes . indeed , parameterizing the results derived from the microscopic model by @xmath12 exchange as before , but using the effective coupling strength @xmath98 at @xmath92 ( dotted curves ) , we obtain rough agreement with the exact result in the @xmath99 partial wave , but underestimate the magnitude considerably in the high partial waves .",
    "obviously the replacement of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchanges by an exchange of a sharp mass @xmath12 meson with a @xmath25-independent coupling can not provide a simultaneous description of both low and high partial waves .",
    "note that the above curves are based on the spectral function with subtraction for obe models .",

    "[ fig:5_6_4 ] we show the corresponding on - shell matrix elements for the @xmath100 channel . also here we see that the results generated by the scalar - isoscalar part of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange are comparable to the ones of the @xmath12 exchange used in the jlich @xmath3 model  a. in fact , correlated @xmath13 exchange is slightly stronger in the @xmath99 partial wave , but weaker in the @xmath101 partial wave .",

    "these differences will have an impact on the properties of the new hyperon - nucleon interaction model currently being developed @xcite .",
    "specifically , the weaker interaction in the scalar - isoscalar channel resulting from our microscopic model of correlated @xmath13 exchange provides much less attraction in the @xmath104 @xmath105-waves and , in turn , should also reduce the coupling between the @xmath106 and @xmath104 channels .",
    "the strong coupling between these two systems in the original jlich @xmath3 model is possibly one of the reasons why it does not lead to a bound state for the hypertriton @xcite .",
    "an essential part of baryon - baryon interactions is the strong medium - range attraction , which in one - boson - exchange models is parameterized by exchange of a fictitious scalar - isoscalar meson with mass around 500 mev . in extended meson exchange models",
    "this part is naturally generated by two - pion exchange contributions . as well as uncorrelated two - pion exchange , correlated contributions",
    "must be included in which the exchanged pions interact during their exchange ; these terms in fact provide the main contribution to the intermediate - range interaction .    in the scalar - isoscalar channel of the @xmath13 interaction the coupling to the @xmath21 channel",
    "plays a strong role , which has to be explicitly included in any realistic model for energies near and above the @xmath21 threshold .",

    "channel the strength of correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange decreases with the strangeness of the baryon - baryon channels , becoming more negative . in the @xmath4 channel",
    "the scalar - isoscalar part of correlated exchanges is stronger by about a factor of 2 than in both hyperon - nucleon channels ( @xmath100 , @xmath103 ) , and 3 to 4 times stronger than in the @xmath19 channels ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) .    with the current model it is now possible to reliably take into account correlated @xmath13 and @xmath21 exchange in both the @xmath12 and @xmath16 channels for various baryon - baryon reactions .",
    "this will be especially important in processes where only scant empirical data exist , as the elimination of the phenomenological @xmath12 and @xmath16 exchanges considerably enhances the predictive power of baryon - baryon interaction models . given the strong constraints on @xmath12 as well as @xmath16 exchange from correlated @xmath13 exchange , a more sound microscopic model for the @xmath3 interaction can hence now be constructed , which can be used to address open questions such as the role of su(3 ) flavor symmetry , or the nature of the short range part of the @xmath22 interaction arising from @xmath44 exchange .",
