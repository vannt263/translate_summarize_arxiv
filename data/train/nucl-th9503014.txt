    "there is currently a great deal of interest in finite - temperature properties of hadronic resonances  @xcite . recently , preliminary results for the @xmath0 meson mass spectrum in si+au collisions at lab energy 11.6 gev / nucleon were obtained at brookhaven s alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) , by reconstructing the @xmath0 mesons from final - state kaon pairs  @xcite .",
    "no change was observed from the vacuum width of the @xmath0 , although a possible small mass shift was observed for the most central events .",
    "these negative preliminary results could dampen the enthusiasm of other groups to study the @xmath0 peak in the dilepton channel .",
    "we show here that no observable change is expected for the @xmath0 peak in the dikaon spectrum , but that effects may be visible in the dilepton spectrum .",
    "thus , there is still good reason to study the dilepton @xmath0 peak at the ags , in spite of the fact that dikaon results are negative .",
    "the behavior of the hot matter is somewhat more complicated in events at ags energies than in ultra - relativistic events , due to the large baryon densities and the lack of strangeness equilibration .",
    "the equation of state used here is almost the same as those used in refs .",
    "we describe the system using the temperature @xmath1 , the baryon chemical potential @xmath2 , and the strangeness and antistrangeness chemical potentials , respectively @xmath3 and @xmath4 , using the high energy conventions @xmath5 .",
    "the matter has nearly isospin zero , so the up and down quark chemical potentials , respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks are approximately in chemical equilibrium with their antiquarks , so the @xmath11 and @xmath12 chemical potentials are @xmath13 . finally , the net strangeness is also zero , since strong interactions conserve strangeness and the time scales are too short to allow weak interactions to be significant .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 chemical potentials are respectively @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so that @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in chemical equilibrium with each other , because @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the volume of the hot matter , @xmath21 is the production rate of @xmath14 quarks per unit volume , @xmath22 is the density of @xmath14 quarks , and @xmath23 is time .",
    "however , we assume for simplicity that the system is in chemical equilibrium , so that @xmath24 ; this assumption will be relaxed in later works .",
    "the mean number of @xmath14 quarks per event is much greater than unity , so the possible @xmath25 pair chemical potential @xcite is omitted .",
    "we model the qgp as a collection of free quarks and gluons , with a constant ( bag ) energy density @xmath26 .",
    "the low - temperature phase is treated as a resonance gas ( rg ) , using all confirmed strongly - interacting particles with known quantum numbers and without @xmath27 or @xmath28 content @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential for resonance @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of constituent quarks of species @xmath32 in resonance @xmath29 , and the chemical potentials correspond to those in the qgp .",
    "we take an excluded volume , @xmath33 , for every resonance in the rg phase @xcite .",
    "our justification for this is that when the resonances overlap , the region where this occurs should be in the qgp phase , so we do not allow overlap in the rg phase .",
    "the transition temperature , @xmath34 , is obtained by setting the pressures equal in the two phases , with all chemical potentials fixed . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the transition temperature as a function of @xmath2 , for the cases ( i ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( strangeness equilibrium under the strong interactions ) , and ( ii ) @xmath37 ( complete strangeness suppression ) .",
    "we give results for @xmath38 and 1 fm in each case , adjusting the bag constant to give @xmath39 mev for @xmath40 ; for the equilibrium case , we take @xmath41 and 220 mev for @xmath38 and 1 fm respectively , while for the case of complete strangeness suppression we take @xmath42 and 210 mev . here ( and for the remainder of this paper ) we evaluate all momentum integrals numerically to one percent accuracy .",
    "we fix @xmath3 for the strangeness equilibrium curves by requiring that the qgp or rg be strangeness - neutral ( @xmath43 ) . at fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "the transition from one strangeness - neutral phase to the other phase ( of arbitrary strangeness ) occurs at almost exactly the same temperature whether the initial phase is qgp or rg , so we only show rg curves .",
    "this result , first noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , is somewhat surprising , as the value of @xmath3 in the rg depends on the strange hadron spectrum , so that the transition temperatures could easily be very different for the two phases .",
    "we model the initial evolution following ref .  @xcite .",
    "we approximate the nucleon wavefunctions to be constant inside cylinders with radius @xmath44 and length ( parallel to the beam direction ) @xmath45 , and zero outside these cylinders .",
    "the radius is given by the nuclear radius , @xmath46 fm for au , while the length in the center of momentum ( cm ) frame is @xmath47 .",
    "here @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the nuclear velocity in the cm frame ; for fixed target collisions at beam energy 11.6 gev / nucleon , @xmath50 . in principle",
    ", @xmath45 is bounded from below by the minimum parton wavelength , of order @xmath51 fm , but for the collisions considered here @xmath52 fm so this lower bound is unimportant .",
    "we then assume that the nucleon properties are unchanged during the collision , and neglect collisions of secondary particles .",
    "the rate of production of any quantity during the collision is then proportional to the overlap of the nucleon wavefunctions .",
    "for example , if the cylinders first touch at proper time @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the position along the beam axis , the baryon rapidity density at rapidity @xmath55 is @xmath56/2 , \\quad & 1/2 < \\tau _ * < 1 , \\\\ 1/2 , \\quad                                 & 1 < \\tau _ * ,                \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is an unspecified normalization constant , and @xmath58 . the volume of hot matter per unit rapidity is approximately @xmath59 , so the baryon density at @xmath55 is @xmath60/\\tau _ * , \\quad & 1/2 < \\tau _ * < 1 , \\\\ 1/\\tau _ * , \\quad                                 & 1 < \\tau _ * ,                \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the observed baryon rapidity density at @xmath55 .    for @xmath62 , we evolve the hot matter hydrodynamically , maintaining boost - invariance ( and hence neglecting transverse expansion ) .",
    "we assume strong superheating in the rg phase , so that the hot matter never makes a transition to qgp , as the temperature never rises very far above @xmath34 .",
    "the hot matter then follows the boost - invariant hydrodynamic equations @xcite @xmath63 along with the equilibrium condition , @xmath64 here @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are respectively the energy density , pressure , and @xmath15 density .",
    "we connect the hydrodynamic evolution to the initial evolution by using the fact that the baryon and entropy rapidity densities , respectively @xmath61 and @xmath68 , are approximately invariant after the initial collisions .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the trajectory followed by the hot matter at @xmath55 in a central au+au collision at 11.6 gev / nucleon , using @xmath69 fm .",
    "we use the preliminary results @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite in the central rapidity region , from which we estimate @xmath72 if the freezeout temperature @xmath73 mev . at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 mev , and",
    "the maximum temperature reached is 169 mev , so the hot matter is only superheated by @xmath77 mev during the initial evolution . for comparison , we show also the trajectory obtained with the initial conditions used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath78 gev-@xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath79 for @xmath81 , along with the critical temperature , @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum temperature reached with this second trajectory is 200 mev , significantly higher than for our trajectory .",
    "however , our trajectory should reflect the conditions of the thermalized matter , which is most likely to remain at @xmath55 , and thus will be accurately determined by rapidity density measurements .",
    "there are a number of calculations of the @xmath0 mass and width at finite @xmath1 .",
    "the range of predictions for the mass is very wide .",
    "haglin and gale  @xcite find that the mass shift @xmath82 increases slowly and monotonically with increasing @xmath1 , with @xmath83 mev , while asakawa and ko  @xcite find that @xmath84 decreases monotonically with @xmath85 mev .",
    "the range of values for the width , @xmath86 , is much narrower .",
    "ko and seibert  @xcite and haglin  @xcite both find that the rg contribution to @xmath86 is approximately 30 mev at @xmath87 mev , although it may be as low as 10 mev if vertex form factors are included  @xcite .",
    "the qgp contribution to the width depends on the dynamics of the two - phase coexistence region , as it is proportional to the fraction of matter in the qgp phase and inversely proportional to the mean qgp droplet radius  @xcite . in the adiabatic limit ( when the nucleation rates for both phases are infinite )",
    ", the qgp contribution to @xmath86 is infinite ; however , the contribution to observable quantities is probably small , just a few mev in an au+au collision at @xmath88 gev / nucleon and of order 10 mev at @xmath89 gev / nucleon .    for the mass",
    ", we take two very different parametrizations , following refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ; @xmath90 we use these masses in the rg phase , and assume that there are no recognizable @xmath0 mesons in the qgp . as the corrections for finite baryon density are uncertain , we neglect them at present . for the width ,",
    "we use @xmath91    the dilepton signal from before freezeout is obtained by convoluting the four - volume per unit rapidity , @xmath92 , the @xmath0 density @xmath93 , the thermal phi mass distribution @xmath94 , and the decay rate to dileptons , @xmath95 .",
    "the post - freezeout contribution is calculated in the same manner , except that we use the vacuum mass and width , and assume that after freezeout the number of @xmath0 mesons decreases exponentially in @xmath96 with the @xmath97 decay rate .",
    "@xmath98,\\ ] ] we take @xmath95 to be constant , evaluate @xmath99 numerically , and assume a breit - wigner mass distribution , @xmath100 ^ 2 { } ~+~ m_{\\phi}^2(t ) \\ , \\gamma^2(t)}.\\ ] ] we neglect possible dileptons produced before the hot matter is thermalized at proper time @xmath101 fm/@xmath27 after the point of maximum overlap ; this signal is probably small , and we have no idea what the mass distribution is for these particles .",
    "the calculation is simplified by the fact that the lepton mean free path is long , so that virtually all produced pairs escape from the hot matter without interacting .",
    "the kaon signal is calculated in almost the same manner , but with two changes .",
    "first , the decay rate to kaons , @xmath102 , depends strongly on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we include this by using @xmath103^{3/2 } } { m_{\\phi}(t)^2 \\ , \\left [ m_{\\phi}(0)^2 - 4 m_k^2 \\right]^{3/2 } } \\gamma(0),\\ ] ] where @xmath104 mev is the vacuum kaon mass .",
    "second , we fold in the probability for the kaons to escape the hot matter without interaction , which is approximately @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mean time between kaon interactions , and @xmath107 is the mean thermal velocity for @xmath0 mesons . the numerator in the first expression is the product of the surface area of the cylinder and the mean distance from the surface for a pair of emerging kaons ( half that for a single kaon ) , while the denominator is the total volume . as the kaon velocity in the @xmath0 rest frame is not too large , we assume that the kaon and @xmath0 velocities are the same ; when the @xmath0 velocity is small enough that this is not true , it is very unlikely that both produced kaons will escape without interaction , so this should produce only a small correction since our escape probability is proportional to @xmath107 and hence goes to zero in this case . @xmath108.\\ ] ] we take @xmath107 to be the ( non - relativistic ) rms thermal velocity , @xmath109^{1/2},\\ ] ] and use the parametrization @xmath110 which agrees well with the results of haglin and pratt @xcite .",
    "we show predicted dilepton and dikaon mass spectra in fig .  3 , taking @xmath111 and @xmath112 mev .",
    "the dikaon spectra differ significantly only far from the @xmath0 peak , when the signal has dropped to less than 1% of the peak value . as there is large combinatoric background near the peak , the small difference in the dikaon signal",
    "will almost certainly be lost , while the difference in the dilepton signal is over 10% and thus may be detectable .",
    "note the small secondary peak in the dilepton spectrum at @xmath113 mev for @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "this peak appears because the hot matter spends @xmath115 fm/ with @xmath116 mev , just as in the case of a first - order phase transition @xcite ( when the hot matter remains at @xmath34 for a long time ) .",
    "the peak here reflects the ( approximately constant ) initial temperature , which results from the spatial extent of the parton wavefunctions , and depends only weakly on @xmath34 . in the case of a phase transition",
    ", the temperature of the hot matter does not remain constant in the coexistence region even though @xmath34 is the same for the two phases , because the entropy per baryon is significantly higher in the qgp at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite , leading to smearing of any secondary @xmath0 meson peak created during a phase transition at finite @xmath2 .",
    "the larger peak at @xmath117 mev is due to the fact that the system is assumed to freeze out instantaneously , so that there is no hot matter with @xmath118 and thus no @xmath0 mesons are seen in the corresponding mass range ; this peak will soften and possibly disappear if more realistic dynamics are used .",
    "although the total signal from dikaons is larger than that from dileptons , the vast majority of the dikaons come from @xmath0 mesons that decay after freezeout of the hot matter .",
    "thus , we see that , not very surprisingly , it is difficult to measure thermal mass shifts by observing strongly interacting particles .",
    "conversely , dileptons make a good probe of thermal mass shifts , since they escape from the hot matter throughout the collision .",
    "there are two reasons for the lack of a strong signal from dikaons .",
    "the first is that , once the @xmath0 mass drops appreciably , the decay rate to dikaons vanishes .",
    "however , this is not so easily corrected by observing meson decay to lighter particles , such as pions .",
    "although the decay rate then increases , the velocity of the decay products also increases , so that it is greater than the mean thermal velocity of the heavy meson .",
    "the decay products then tend to emerge back - to - back in the lab frame , so that the probability of both decay products escaping from the hot matter without interacting is small .",
    "it is also possible that the kaon mass drops with increasing @xmath1  @xcite , and that the @xmath0 mesons decay to these lighter kaons .",
    "however , in this case we expect that the thermal kaons will interact when they leave the hot matter , as they acquire the vacuum kaon mass , and that this interaction will likely remove the pairs from the @xmath0 peak .    as a result of the lack of sensitivity of the dikaon signal to thermal @xmath0 meson properties",
    ", it is very important to study dilepton production in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , particularly near vector meson peaks .",
    "this is the only likely means for detecting finite - temperature shifts in meson masses and widths . as the study of meson properties may provide valuable insight into the equation of state of hot strongly - interacting matter @xcite , we would hope to see more experimental attention devoted to these measurements in the future .",
