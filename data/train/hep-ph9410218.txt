    "<S> our problem is to determine this asymptotic behavior .    an elegant way to solve </S>",
    "<S> this problem is to construct a sequence of two effective field theories which reproduce static correlation functions at successively longer distances . </S>",

    "<S> it is @xmath45 the coefficients of some of the higher dimension operators in @xmath40 were recently calculated to leading order by chapman @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of the polyakov loop correlator comes not from the 1loop diagram in which two electrostatic gluons are exchanged , but instead from higher  loop diagrams that involve the exchange of magnetostatic gluons . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> magnetostatic gluons remain massless in eqcd , and the diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] give a contribution to the correlator that falls like @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not the correct asymptotic behavior , since nonperturbative effects become important at a distance @xmath0 of order @xmath56 .    in order to determine the true asymptotic behavior of the polyakov loop correlator </S>",
    "<S> , it is useful to construct a second effective field that reproduces static correlators at distances @xmath0 of order @xmath56 or larger . this effective theory , which we call magnetostatic qcd ( mqcd ) , is a pure su(3 ) gauge theory in 3 space dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the only fields are the magnetostatic gluon fields @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the action is @xmath57 where @xmath58 includes all local gauge - invariant operators that can be constructed out of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge coupling constant of mqcd and the parameters in @xmath58 can be tuned so that mqcd is completely equivalent to eqcd , and therefore to thermal qcd , at distances of order @xmath56 or larger . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath44 is sufficiently small , the parameters of mqcd can be obtained by perturbative calculations in eqcd . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion parameter is @xmath59 , which is of order @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge theory mqcd itself is inherently nonperturbative . </S>",
    "<S> any perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath37 is hopelessly plagued with infrared divergences . </S>",
    "<S> thus the correlation functions in this theory must be calculated nonperturbatively using lattice simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the static correlators of gauge - invariant operators in eqcd are reproduced at distances @xmath60 by the corresponding operators in mqcd . </S>",
    "<S> in eqcd , the polyakov loop operator creates electrostatic gluons only . </S>",
    "<S> it couples to magnetostatic gluons through loop diagrams involving electrostatic gluons , such as the 1loop diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> because of screening , electrostatic gluons can only propagate over distances of order @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for magnetostatic gluons with wavelengths much greater than @xmath61 , the polyakov loop operator behaves like a point - like operator that creates magnetostatic gluons . </S>",
    "<S> it can therefore be expanded out in terms of local gauge - invariant operators constructed out of the field @xmath38 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 represents operators of dimension 5 or larger , such as @xmath65 .    like the parameters in the effective action ( [ mqcd ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients in the operator expansion ( [ plope ] ) are computable in terms of the parameters of the eqcd action using perturbation theory in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> both eqcd and mqcd reproduce the nonperturbative dynamics of thermal qcd at distances much greater than @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> their perturbation expansions also give equivalent ( although incorrect ) descriptions of the long - distance dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> since the coefficients in the operator expansion ( [ plope ] ) are insensitive to the long - distance dynamics , the equivalence between perturbative eqcd and perturbative mqcd can be exploited as a device to compute the coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to calculate the coefficient @xmath66 in ( [ plope ] ) to leading order in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest quantity that can be used to calculate @xmath66 is the coupling of the polyakov loop operator to two long - wavelength magnetostatic gluons , which we denote by @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the gluons to have momenta @xmath68 and @xmath69 , vector indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and color indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in perturbative mqcd </S>",
    "<S> , we can read off the coupling of the operator @xmath74 to the two gluons directly from the expression ( [ plope ] ) for the polyakov loop operator : @xmath75 in perturbative eqcd , the coupling is given by the sum of the 1loop diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] : @xmath76 expanding the integrand out to second order in @xmath68 and @xmath69 and evaluating the loop integrals , we find that ( [ omgge ] ) reduces to @xmath77 comparing ( [ omgg ] ) and ( [ omggk ] ) , we can read off the coefficient @xmath66 : @xmath78 having determined the coefficient @xmath66 in the operator expansion ( [ plope ] ) to leading order in @xmath6 , we can now express the polyakov loop correlator ( [ cpl ] ) in terms of correlators in mqcd : @xmath79 the @xmath64 in ( [ cgg ] ) represents the contributions of higher dimension operators in the operator expansion ( [ plope ] ) , such as @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of a correlator in mqcd , such as the one in ( [ cgg ] ) , is related to the spectrum of qcd in ( 2 + 1 ) space - time dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this is a confining gauge theory with a dynamically generated mass gap @xmath81 between the vacuum and the state of next lowest energy . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle states in the spectrum are bound states of gluons ( glueballs ) , and @xmath81 is the mass of the lightest glueball . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the lowest glueball @xmath82 is a scalar particle , the fourier transform of the correlator @xmath83 has a pole at @xmath84 , as well as poles and branch cuts that are farther from the real @xmath85 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior in @xmath0 is dominated by the pole at @xmath84 . denoting the residue of the pole by @xmath86 , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior is @xmath87 both the mass @xmath81 and the coupling strength @xmath88 can be calculated using lattice simulations of mqcd . by dimensional analysis , @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath9 , while @xmath88 is proportional to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall coefficient of the exponential in ( [ cmas ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare the asymptotic behavior ( [ cmas ] ) with the result one would obtain at leading order in perturbation theory in mqcd . </S>",
    "<S> the leading order diagram is the 1loop diagram in which two magnetostatic gluons are exchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of a dynamically - generated magnetic screening mass @xmath90 can be taken into account by replacing the propagators @xmath91 of the gluons by @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression for the correlator is @xmath93\\ ] ] the perturbative result , which is obtained by setting @xmath94 , falls like @xmath55 . in the presence of magnetic screening , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior is @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> thus this model does not give the same asymptotic behavior as ( [ cmas ] ) , even if we make the identification @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlator of polyakov loops has been calculated nonperturbatively using lattice simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have found that , at temperatures well above the quark  </S>",
    "<S> gluon plasma phase transition , the behavior of the correlator at large @xmath0 is consistent with the form @xmath97 with @xmath98 in the range @xmath99 . at the highest temperatures available , </S>",
    "<S> the preferred value of @xmath98 is close to 2 , as predicted by the leading electrostatic contribution ( [ ceas ] ) . at lower temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the preferred value of @xmath98 is closer to 1 , consistent with the true asymptotic result ( [ cmas ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results have a simple interpretation . the electrostatic contribution ( [ ceas ] ) </S>",
    "<S> falls off like @xmath100 , with a coefficient proportional to @xmath101 . the magnetostatic contribution ( [ cmas ] ) </S>",
    "<S> falls off more slowly like @xmath102 , but its coefficient is proportional to @xmath14 . at the highest temperatures that have been probed by lattice simulations , the running coupling constant @xmath44 is quite small . </S>",
    "<S> because it has a very small coefficient , the magnetostatic contribution will probably not dominate over the electrostatic contribution until @xmath0 is much larger than the size of present lattices . </S>",
    "<S> thus the measured correlator behaves like @xmath103 , and the mass @xmath104 extracted by fitting the correlator to this form can be interpreted as twice the debye screening mass . at lower temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostatic contribution is not so strongly suppressed and the true asymptotic behavior @xmath105 is probably observed on the lattice . if this interpretation of the numerical simulations is correct , then the mass @xmath104 extracted from fitting the correlator to the form @xmath106 has nothing to do with debye screening , but instead is related to magnetostatic effects . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation could be verified by calculating @xmath13 and @xmath107 using a lattice simulation of mqcd . </S>",
    "<S> one could then use ( [ cmas ] ) to predict quantitatively how large @xmath0 must be in order to reach the truly asymptotic region of the polyakov loop correlator .    </S>",
