    "runaway stars are isolated stars or binaries which have escaped from their parent clusters .",
    "a satisfactory set of observational characteristics that defines them is difficult to find .",
    "often , it is assumed that a runaway star must have a space velocity of @xmath0 or greater .",
    "the most commonly observed massive runaway stars are ob runaways @xcite . currently about 56 such stars are known in the galaxy , @xcite with velocities up to @xmath1 .",
    "there are some cases known with velocities greater than @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these high velocities and the stellar lifetimes of a few million years imply that such stars travel many parsecs from their initial positions before themselves exploding in core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "there are two scenarios that create massive runaway stars .",
    "the first is dynamical ejection scenario ( des ) where stars are ejected by close encounters in a dense cluster .",
    "the second is the binary supernova scenario ( bss ) when one of the stars in a binary under goes a sn explosion and the system becomes unbound .",
    "the companion star then travels at roughly its pre - sn orbital velocity .",
    "it is thought that both scenarios contribute similar numbers of runaway stars .",
    "however evidence suggests that the bss could be responsible for up to two thirds of observed runaways @xcite .",
    "methods to discriminate between the two rely on the observational characteristics of the runaway star .",
    "typically bss runaways are expected to have a surface compositions that indicates they have experienced a binary interaction , while typical des runaways might have main - sequence composition .",
    "a further complication is that some runaway stars , especially those with velocities in excess of about @xmath3 , may come from a binary that was ejected by the des with one star being boosted to high velocities after a bss ejection as discussed by @xcite .",
    "such binaries would be less common but could naturally explain the highest velocities observed for runaway stars .",
    "interest in the final fate of runaway stars has increased owing to the observations of @xcite .",
    "they observed that some long gamma - ray bursts @xcite occur a few hundred parsecs away from the nearest star forming region .",
    "@xcite suggest that this can be explained if the progenitor of the grb was the secondary in a binary system that was ejected via the bss .",
    "concurrently the observations made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite also reveal details of how sne are distributed in their host galaxies .",
    "they found that type ic sne and grbs tend to be associated with the most luminous parts , and thus the sites of most intense star - formation , of galaxies while type  ii and type  ib sne tend to be more evenly distributed throughout their host galaxies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite put this down to the difference in progenitor mass for the different sn types .",
    "the most massive stars explode earliest and thus closest to the sites of active star formation . while less massive stars have longer lifetimes and are not as closely associated with the most recent star formation .",
    "they did not consider the effect of runaway stars .",
    "it is important to understand how runaways change the distribution of sne within a galaxy to remove any systematic error in determining the nature of different sn progenitors .    in this paper",
    "we concern ourselves with describing the population of runaway stars from the bss and their effect on the distribution of sne within a galaxy .",
    "first we describe our method of simulating the runaways .",
    "secondly we give our predictions for the space velocities of runaway stars , binaries and compact remnants and the distances our model runaways travel before exploding as sne .",
    "thirdly we outline how this affects how sne are distributed with respect to their initial locations .",
    "fourthly we perform a similar analysis for the merger of double compact object binaries owing to orbital decay by gravitational radiation .",
    "finally we discuss our results and outline our conclusions .",
    "our method is built upon the models and the population synthesis code described by @xcite .",
    "we use the large number of detailed stellar evolution models that were calculated with the cambridge stars evolution code , created by @xcite and updated by various authors since @xcite .",
    "the population synthesis code then uses our detailed binary models to estimate various details of a binary population that are of interest and comparable with observations .",
    "for example , the relative numbers of different stellar types , the relative rates of different sn types and , here , the expected velocities of runaway stars .",
    "similar studies have used binary population synthesis to predict the runaway population before @xcite .",
    "however this is the first time the effect of runaway stars on the distribution of sne within galaxies has been considered .",
    "while a full description of our detailed models can be found in @xcite we provide a brief overview .",
    "all the models employ our standard mass - loss prescription because it agrees best with various observations @xcite . for pre - wr mass loss",
    ", we use the rates of @xcite except for ob stars for which we use the theoretical rates of @xcite .",
    "when the star becomes a wr star [ @xmath4 , @xmath5 , we use the rates of @xcite .",
    "we scale all rates with the standard factor @xmath6 @xcite , except for the rates of @xcite which include their own metallicity scaling .",
    "we have modified our stellar evolution code to model binary evolution .",
    "the details of our binary interaction algorithm are relatively simple compared to the scheme outlined by @xcite .",
    "we used their scheme as a basis but we changed some details which can not be directly applied to our detailed stellar evolution calculation .",
    "we also make a number of assumptions to keep our code relatively simple . our aim was to investigate the effect of enhanced mass loss due to binary interactions on stellar lifetimes and populations .",
    "therefore , we concentrated on this rather than every possible physical process which would add more uncertainty to our model .",
    "we also make assumptions in calculating our synthetic population to avoid calculating a large number of models . for example",
    ", we do not model the accretion on to the secondary in the detailed code .",
    "we take the final mass of the secondary at the end of the primary evolution as the initial mass of the secondary when we create our detailed secondary model .",
    "this avoids calculating 10 times more secondary models than primary models .",
    "we always define the primary as the initially more massive star and we only evolve one star at a time with our detailed code . when we evolve the primary in detail , it has a shorter evolutionary time - scale than the secondary which remains on the main sequence until after the primary completes its evolution and so we can determine the state of the secondary with the single stellar evolution equations of @xcite .",
    "when we evolve the secondary in detail , we assume that its companion is the compact remnant of the primary ( a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ) and treat this as a point mass .",
    "if roche lobe overflow occurs mass lost from the primary is transferred to the secondary but not all is necessarily accreted .",
    "accretion causes the star to expand owing to increased total mass and therefore an increased energy production rate if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the thermal , or kelvin - helmholtz , time - scale .",
    "we assume that the star s maximum accretion rate is determined by its current mass and its thermal timescale .",
    "we define a maximum accretion rate for a star such that @xmath9 .",
    "if the accretion rate is greater than this , then any additional mass and its orbital angular momentum are lost from the system . in general ,",
    "stars with lower masses have longer thermal time - scales than more massive stars .",
    "efficient transfer is only possible if the two stars are of nearly equal mass so the thermal time - scales are similar .",
    "this is an approximate treatment but provides a similar result to the more complex model of @xcite who included rotation and found that it led to inefficient mass transfer . for compact companions",
    ", we derive the maximum accretion rate from the eddington limit @xcite .    in summary",
    "our stellar models are a set of around 15,000 detailed stellar evolution models of single stars , primary stars , secondary stars and merged systems @xcite .",
    "we also include a new series of models to account for quasi - homogeneous evolution .",
    "these are discussed below . for this work we made several refinements to our population synthesis code to predict runaway velocities and account for the possibility of sn reversal .",
    "that is when the initially lower - mass secondary star undergoes its sn first after mass accretion .",
    "our population synthesis calculations are built upon those described by @xcite with some improvements .",
    "here we focus on the evolution after the first sn in the binary .",
    "first we estimate the lifetimes of the primary and the secondary star .",
    "our secondary models only have a limited companion mass range but this provides a reasonable estimate because the lifetime varies little with different amounts of mass loss .",
    "we compare the lifetimes of the two stars to check whether the sn order is reversed .",
    "we find that it is more likely at higher metallicity but only occasional , occurring in 7 per cent of our binary systems .",
    "if the secondary lifetime is shorter than the primary lifetime we perform a similar calculation as described below but now the secondary explodes first and may eject the primary star .",
    "this gives rise to more stripped sne occurring away from their initial position .",
    "if a star has a carbon / oxygen core mass greater than @xmath10 and the final mass of the star is greater than @xmath11 we assume it explodes in a sn .",
    "we select the sn type as described below.we estimate what type of compact remnant a stellar model will produce by using the method outline in @xcite .",
    "we assume that first a neutron star is formed at the centre of the star after core collapse of mass @xmath12 .",
    "this produces about @xmath13j of energy from the release of gravitational binding energy in neutron star formation .",
    "we then assume a hundredth of this energy is transferred into the envelope by some unknown mechanism .",
    "the current suggestion is the transfer occurs via neutrinos released from forming the protoneutron star that are thermalized within the envelope or dense outer parts of the core .",
    "we integrate the binding energy of the star from the surface towards the centre until we reach @xmath14 . the envelope outside this region",
    "is ejected with the remaining amount forming the remnant .",
    "if we have @xmath15 , it is a black hole and we set @xmath16 .",
    "otherwise we have a neutron star with mass @xmath17 .",
    "we determine the fate of the binary if a neutron star is formed by the work of @xcite and @xcite with the latest determination for the kick velocity distribution from observations of @xcite .",
    "if the system is unbound then the velocities of both stars are calculated by the method of @xcite that considers every relevant factor . however we neglect the supernova impact on the companion star .",
    "if the system remains bound then the velocity of both components is the resultant system velocity @xcite .",
    "if the remnant is a black hole , we assume that it receives a similar kick . because the masses of black holes are greater than those of neutron stars we use the kick distribution of @xcite but as a momentum distribution .",
    "we calculated the black hole kick velocity , @xmath18 from @xmath19 .",
    "where @xmath20 is a kick velocity selected at random from the neutron star kick velocity distribution and @xmath21 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "black holes are not normally considered to have significant kicks although their importance has been investigated by others @xcite .",
    "we find that we must include them or we obtain no runaway wr stars with initial masses greater than @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting velocities of runaway stars and runaway binaries are recorded .",
    "we also record the sn type and its location at the initial position of the binary .",
    "we weight each event by a saltpeter imf and assume the distributions of initial mass ratios and the logarithm of separations are flat .",
    "our models have initial separations that take values between @xmath23 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the mass ratio takes values of @xmath24 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.9 .",
    "we do not use the @xmath25 models employed by @xcite because there is growing evidence that the mass ratio is skewed to larger values in massive binaries @xcite .",
    "we next consider the fate of the secondary star .",
    "if it accreted material from the primary we assume the star is rejuvenated and use its post mass transfer mass as its new initial mass . if a secondary accreted more than 5 per cent of its initial mass when it was a main - sequence star we assume it has been spun up and rotationally induced mixing mixes fresh hydrogen into the core and it is rejuvenated and take it to be a zero - age main - sequence star .",
    "we do this at all metallicities .",
    "this extends the lifetime of some of our runaway stars .",
    "this is a similar assumption as used by @xcite . if the binary was unbound by the first sn we use a single star model to determine the result of its evolution .",
    "if the system remains bound then we use our secondary models . if the secondary experiences a sn it does so after it has travelled away from the location of the primary sn .",
    "we determine the distance travelled by considering in detail the geometry of situation using the runaway velocity relative to the original plane , the orientation of the binary to the line of site , the phase of the stars in the binary and the time that has passed since the first sn .",
    "we then record the location of the sn .",
    "finally we determine the final outcome of the binary and whether the system is unbound or a double compact object .",
    "we record the velocities of the single and binary compact object .",
    "we perform the above analysis over the full range of our primary models .",
    "because we select our neutron star kicks at random , we repeat our calculations a large number of times to cover the full range of possible outcomes after the first sn .",
    "we include one new evolutionary path , not in the standard picture of binary evolution for our secondary stars .",
    "if a secondary accreted more than 5 per cent of its initial mass as discussed above we assume it has been spun up and rotationally induced mixing mixes fresh hydrogen into the core and it is rejuvenated and take it to be a zero - age main - sequence star . if the secondary s initial metal mass fraction is less than or equal to @xmath26 and it has a mass after accretion of more than @xmath27 , we assume it continues to evolve fully mixed during its entire main - sequence lifetime .",
    "this is referred to as quasi - homogeneous evolution ( qhe ) .",
    "it is the result of rapid rotation due to the accretion of material from the primary star and is described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the star does not spin down as at lower metallicity stellar winds are weaker so less angular momentum can be lost .    to include we use simple models",
    "in which we assume the stars are fully mixed during their hydrogen burning evolution .",
    "once hydrogen burning ends this extra mixing is turned off .",
    "we use the models whether the binary was bound or unbound after the primary sn .",
    "we find , at @xmath28 , qhe increases the percentage of sne that are type ib / c from 20 to 26 per cent .",
    "we find that three per cent of all stars that experience qhe give rise to a long - grb as we also require a final co core mass of greater than @xmath29 for a long - grb to occur .",
    "more metal rich stars do not experience qhe as we assume the stars rapidly spin - down as the stronger stellar winds take away angular momentum more rapidly .",
    "our requirement for qhe to occur may seem quite relaxed .",
    "@xcite restricted their study to a case b , post - main - sequence mass - transfer system rather than case a system .",
    "this was to avoid orbital synchronization slowing the rotation of the secondary .",
    "therefore we may be overestimating the number of long - grbs via qhe .",
    "however most of the qhe systems in our models are case b and also systems with high mass ratios which have similar thermal timescales so mass - transfer is most efficient .",
    "therefore the opportunity of tidal synchronization is low .",
    "further more such synchronization is unlikely as the stars have radiative envelopes during much of their evolution .",
    "thus any tidal forces are likely to be weak .",
    "in addition our 5 per cent increase in mass required for qhe may also seem arbitrary .",
    "only about 10 percent of the mass of a main sequence star needs to be accreted to bring its spin from zero to critical .",
    "however qhe does not need critical rotation and the initial rotation rate of these stars is not zero .",
    "therefore 5 per cent is a reasonable limit .",
    "a full treatment would require a more detailed model of rotation within the star and the binary .",
    "however the inclusion of this would severely limit the stability of the code and thus make it currently difficult to create the large number of models required for population synthesis .      in table",
    "[ mergers ] we list the relative fraction of binaries that merge before the first sn occurs .",
    "we find that 7 to 10 per cent of binaries with primaries massive enough to explode in a sn experience a merger .",
    "therefore the majority of binaries provide two possible supernova progenitors and contribute to the runaway stars .",
    "however even stars not massive enough to provide a sn can merge and in some cases the resulting star is massive enough to produce a sn .",
    "we find more mergers in the higher mass binaries .",

    "<S> when a core collapse supernova occurs in a binary system , the surviving star as well as the compact remnant emerging from the supernova , may reach a substantial space velocity . with binary population synthesis modelling at solar and one fifth of solar metallicity </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the velocities of such runaway stars or binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we compile predictions for runaway ob stars , red supergiants and wolf - rayet stars , either isolated or with a compact companion . for those stars or binaries which undergo a second stellar explosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until a type  ii or type  ibc supernova or a long or short gamma - ray burst occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we find our predicted population of ob runaway stars broadly matches the observed population of stars but , to match the fastest observed wolf - rayet runaway stars , we require that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at solar metallicity type  ic supernova progenitors travel shorter distances than the progenitors of other supernova types because they are typically more massive and thus have shorter lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> those of type  iip supernovae can fly farthest about 48pc _ on average _ at solar metallicity , with about 8 per cent of them reaching 100pc . in considering the consequences of assuming that the progenitors of long gamma - ray bursts are spun - up secondary stars that experience quasi - homogeneous evolution , we find that such evolution has a dramatic effect on the population of runaway wolf - rayet stars and that some 30 per cent of grbs could occur a hundred parsecs or more from their initial positions . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider mergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we find the most common type of visible mergers are neutron star  </S>",

    "<S> all compact mergers have a wide range of merger times from years to gyrs and are predicted to occur three hundred times less often than supernovae in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that there may be a population of low - velocity neutron stars that are ejected from a binary rather than by their own natal kick . </S>",
    "<S> these neutrons stars need to be included when the distribution of neutron star kicks is deduced from observations .    </S>",
