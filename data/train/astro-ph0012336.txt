    "the shapes of distant galaxies can be distorted due to gravitational lensing by the intervening matter distribution ( gunn 1967 ; see e.g. bartelmann & schneider 1999 for a recent review and further references ) . while the distortions are usually small , a signal can still be detected statistically since neighboring objects will be deformed in a similar way , thereby producing measurable correlations in galaxy shapes .",
    "recently , shape distortions of order 1% have been detected by several groups in deep galaxy surveys on scales from one up to several arc minutes ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 , wittman et al .",
    "2000 , bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 , kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ) .",
    "the amplitude of these distortions appears consistent with that predicted from weak lensing by large scale structure .",
    "weak lensing is not the only possible source of galaxy shape correlations ; these can also arise between physically close galaxies as a consequence of the galaxy formation process or subsequent interactions .",
    "one possible mechanism for this is the coupling of galaxy spins : galaxy disks tend to be oriented perpendicular to their angular momentum vectors , so angular momentum couplings of neighbors will induce alignments in the projected galaxy shapes .",
    "this will also be true but to a lesser extent for elliptical galaxies if they rotate along their shortest axis .",
    "the amplitude of the expected shape correlations from angular momentum couplings have recently been studied in numerical simulations by heavens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and analytically by crittenden et al .",
    "( cnpt 2000 ) , while alternative mechanisms for intrinsic correlations have also been suggested ( croft and metzler 2000 ; catelan et al .",
    "intrinsic correlations will be especially important in relatively shallow surveys such as the 2df or the sloan digital sky survey , where the median redshift is @xmath0 .",
    "evidence for the existence of such intrinsic correlations in the nearby universe has been recently presented by pen , lee & seljak ( 2000 ) and brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , looking in the tully and the super cosmos galaxy catalogs , respectively .",
    "one way of disentangling the intrinsic shape correlations from those induced by weak lensing is to examine the patterns of the average galaxy shapes .",
    "the shapes of galaxies are typically described by two degrees of freedom ; their average ellipticity and orientation . the distribution of galaxy shapes can be described by a symmetric and traceless 2d tensor field . in general ,",
    "any such tensor field can be written as a sum of two terms , one of which is curl - free and the other is divergence - free . in analogy with the radiation field in electromagnetism , these are usually referred to as the ` electric ' ( @xmath1 ) and the ` magnetic ' ( @xmath2 ) component , respectively .",
    "lensing by a point mass will create a tangential , curl - free distortion pattern .",
    "the most general distortion field produced by lensing will be a linear superposition of such patterns and will also be a curl - free , ( i.e. @xmath1-type ) field ( kaiser 1992 , stebbins 1996 ) .",
    "however , as we show below , the distortion field resulting from intrinsic spin alignments has @xmath1 and @xmath2-type modes of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this property will enable us to uniquely disentangle angular momentum correlations and to subtract their contribution from a measured distortion field in order to more accurately compute and isolate the distortions induced by lensing alone .",
    "when the deformations are dominated by lensing , the @xmath3 decomposition can improve the signal to noise level , since noise and other systematic effects are expected to contribute to both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels .",
    "current surveys have measured the sum of @xmath1 and @xmath2 powers , thus doubling the noise power relative to the decomposition strategy that we propose here .",
    "the expected amplitude of galaxy shape correlations is fairly small . in order to measure it given the large scatter in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies , many galaxies must be observed . at present , observations of mean ellipticities are dominated by the intrinsic scatter .",
    "direct decomposition into @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes is a non - local operation , requiring derivatives of these noisy observations and so is very problematic . here",
    "we show how the correlation functions of the observable ellipticities can be directly converted into correlations of the @xmath1 and @xmath2-modes .",
    "it is also useful to have locally defined quantities which reflect the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decomposition .",
    "kaiser et al . ( 1994 ) and schneider et al . ( 1998 ) looked at this issue in the context of lensing and developed a statistic known as the ` aperture mass ' which enabled them to put a lower bound on the projected mass in a localized region of the sky .",
    "more generally , this statistic gives a direct , local measure of the electric contribution to the distortion field , and a similar observable can be evaluated to measure the magnetic component .",
    "we develop this formalism here and relate the correlations of these local @xmath1 and @xmath2 estimators to those of the observable ellipticities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by defining the @xmath3 decomposition in terms of observed ellipticities , and demonstrate that the lensing distortions are curl free , whereas those due to intrinsic alignments are not . in section  3 ,",
    "we discuss estimators of the @xmath3 correlations and their relation to correlators of the ellipticities . in section  4",
    ", we define the local @xmath1 and @xmath2 measures and calculate their correlations .",
    "we conclude in sections 5 - 6 with a cookbook style summary on how the @xmath3 decomposition can be derived from the statistical weak lensing surveys .",
    "the projected shape of a galaxy on the sky can be approximated by an ellipse with semi - axes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , of which the major axis makes an angle @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath8-axis of the chosen coordinate system .",
    "it can then be concisely written as a complex number , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the phase dependence @xmath12 expresses the fact that the ellipticity is invariant under a rotation over @xmath13 radians .",
    "note that the two components @xmath14 and @xmath15 are analogous to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 stokes parameters for linearly polarized light . given a distribution of galaxies on the sky with measured ellipticities",
    ", the complex scalar ellipticity field defines a traceless , symmetric @xmath18 tensor field , @xmath19_{ab } = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\epsilon_{+ } & \\epsilon_{\\times}\\\\   \\epsilon_{\\times } & -\\epsilon_{+ } \\end{array}\\right]\\ , .",

    "see stebbins ( 1996 ) for the generalization to a curved sky .",
    "the shear field eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) can be written in terms of a gradient or @xmath1  -piece and a curl or pseudo - scalar @xmath2  -piece ( stebbins 1996 ) by introducing two scalar functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "each component of the ellipticity field can be written as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath24 the @xmath1 and @xmath2 parts can be extracted explicitly from the shear tensor by applying the @xmath25 operator , @xmath26 the relation between the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the projected gravitational potential will become obvious in what follows . it is useful to perform the @xmath3 decomposition in terms of variables that have the same dimension as the measured ellipticities ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these are related to the ellipticities by @xmath29    since only the _ derivatives _ of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined in terms of the ellipticity field , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are ambiguous up to a constant and linear gradient term . in the same way ,",
    "constant and linear gradient terms in the measured ellipticities should not impact the @xmath3 decomposition . to see this , consider an ellipticity field where @xmath34 and @xmath35 this can either be a consequence of a pure @xmath1-mode ( @xmath36 ) , the result of a pure @xmath2-mode ( @xmath37 ) , or a linear combination of the two .",
    "a rotation of the basis axes translates @xmath38 into @xmath39 and vice versa , but does not affect the @xmath3 decomposition . in particular , the ellipticity measured in a basis which is at an angle @xmath40 relative to the original basis is given by : @xmath41 thus , a global rotation of @xmath42 transforms @xmath43 , but since the position vectors are also rotated , the @xmath3 decomposition remains invariant .",
    "however , one can also take an ellipticity field and rotate each ellipticity individually by @xmath42 , keeping the position vectors fixed .",
    "this new ellipticity map has the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes of the original map interchanged : @xmath44 .      in the case of gravitational lensing",
    ", the resultant distortion field @xmath45 can be written in terms of a gravitational deflection potential @xmath7 as ( e.g. bartelmann and schneider 1999 ) @xmath46 the deflection potential @xmath7 is a convolution over the projected surface mass density @xmath47 , @xmath48 . comparing this expression to the @xmath3 decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eb1 ] ) we can identify @xmath49 and @xmath50 thus for the shear field induced by lensing , the @xmath1-mode is related to @xmath51 , the projected surface mass density in units of the critical surface mass density for a given configuration of source and lens , and the @xmath2-mode is identically zero ( as was discussed by kaiser 1995 ; kamionkowski et al .",
    "note that weak lensing only approximately gives pure @xmath1-modes , as @xmath2-modes may arise when the light is bent in more than one scattering event .",
    "however , these @xmath2-modes arise at higher order and are suppressed relative to the @xmath1-modes .",
    "if one measures the @xmath1-mode contribution of a given map and then rotates every measured ellipticity by @xmath42 and repeats the same measurement , one obtains an estimate of the @xmath2-contribution which should be consistent with zero for a pure lensing signal .",
    "therefore , the absence of @xmath2-modes naturally provides a robust test for isolating the lensing component of the distortion field and provides an estimate of the noise level of the data ( kaiser 1992 ) .",
    "note that lensing is not the only possible source of curl - free correlations .",
    "if the shapes of galaxies are primarily determined by tidal stretching , this would lead to intrinsic correlations ( catelan , kamionkowski & blandford , 2000 ; croft & metzler , 2000 ) . for these shape distortions ,",
    "the observed ellipticities are also linear in the tidal field , leading to pure electric modes just as in lensing . for spiral galaxies which have had many dynamical times to evolve ,",
    "tidal stretching is likely to be small compared to the contribution from spin alignments . even for elliptical galaxies , a bulk rotation of as small as 1",
    "km / sec would erase the galaxy s original alignment .",
    "almost all observed ellipticals rotate faster than that , so the shape - shear alignment in catelan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is unlikely to be observable .",
    "however , it could be significant for larger objects like clusters which are dynamically much younger .",
    "shape correlations between galaxies can also arise from alignments in the direction of their angular momenta . while this is particularly true for spiral galaxies , given the assumption that their disks are perpendicular to the angular momentum vectors , it is true to a lesser extent for elliptical galaxies as well .",
    "ellipticals probably rotate about their intermediate axis ( dubinski 1992 ) , so averaging over all statistical randomized alignments , the average major axis is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector , just like a spiral galaxy .",
    "the strength of the correlation signal has recently been studied in numerical simulations by heavens et al .",
    "we have recently attempted to model these theoretically ( cnpt 2000 ) by assuming angular momentum is induced by tidal torques . following the formalism developed by catelan and theuns ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the correlations can be calculated for gaussian initial fluctuations using linear theory coupled with the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the induced intrinsic correlations of ellipticities will primarily result from correlations in the direction of the angular momenta .",
    "as discussed in cnpt this implies that the ellipticities are effectively quadratic in the angular momenta , @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the shear of the gravitational potential , and @xmath54 denotes the shear tensor normalized by @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 run over three coordinates , @xmath58 in contrast to above where two dimensional ( projected ) quantities were considered . the quadratic dependence on the shear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tshear ] ) is fundamentally different from the linear one appropriate for the lensing case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gshear ] ) , and as a result the @xmath2-modes are non - zero .    in particular , it is straight forward to show that @xmath59 and similarly @xmath60 the amplitude of the @xmath2-modes is comparable to that of the @xmath1-modes , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the presence of @xmath2-modes provides a mechanism for disentangling the correlations which arise from lensing from those resulting from intrinsic alignments due to angular momentum couplings .",
    "this is not the sole means of disentangling intrinsic correlations from weak lensing .",
    "the observed ellipticity correlations from intrinsic alignments are strongest at low redshifts , while the lensing signal is larger when the sources are at higher redshifts .",
    "in addition , morphology distinctions will be useful , since intrinsic correlations of elliptical galaxies are smaller than those of spirals because they are intrinsically more round .",
    "further possible methods for distinguishing lensing from intrinsic correlations are discussed in catelan , kamionkowski and blandford ( 2000 ) and cnpt ( 2000 ) .",
    "the decomposition into curl and gradient contributions is most straight forwardly performed in fourier space ( kamion - kowski et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , often it is useful to consider this in real space , as many issues which might complicate matters in fourier space , such as finite field size or patchy sampling , are more easily handled in real space . in this section",
    "we deal with performing the decomposition statistically in real space using the ellipticity two point functions .",
    "this approach is particularly relevant when the observations are noise dominated , such as is the case when there are relatively few galaxies with which to measure the mean ellipticity , which is the case for the current surveys on small scales where most of the lensing signal lies . in the next section",
    ", we will address the issue of a local decomposition .      here",
    "we will relate the correlations of the electric and magnetic shear directly to correlations of the ellipticity .",
    "the real space correlation function of @xmath30 is related to correlation of its corresponding potential , @xmath20 , by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "an analogous relation holds for @xmath31 correlations , while the cross correlation , @xmath63 , is zero if the field is invariant under parity transformations .",
    "these correlations can be directly computed from the observed correlations in @xmath38 and @xmath39 , defined through @xmath64 where the ensemble average is over pairs with separation @xmath65 , for which the separation vector @xmath66 makes an angle @xmath40 with respect to the chosen basis .",
    "the sum of these correlations is rotationally invariant , but their difference depends explicitly on the choice of orientation of the coordinate axes ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ) .",

    "this operator is not simply a convolution as would be the case if @xmath101 were a function only of the difference @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , the fourier space operator takes nearly the same form as the real space operator .",

    "in contrast to the gravitational lensing cases , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes are seen to be of comparable magnitude in this model .",
    "various parameter choices have been made in the examples we have shown , but we believe the @xmath3 decomposition to be largely independent of most of these . for simplicity , the figures assume the galaxies are effectively perfect disks ( @xmath129 in the notation of cnpt ) . using more realistic galaxy shapes will only suppress the overall amplitude of the correlations .",
    "we have also assumed that the angular momentum directions correspond with those that would be predicted by linear theory ( @xmath130 ) non - linear evolution may affect the direction of a galaxy s angular momentum , but as long as these changes are not coherent then they will only suppress the overall correlation amplitudes . finally , we have assumed a mean redshift for the sources of @xmath131 .",
    "changing this will change the angular scale at which a given level of correlations are seen , but it should not affect the nature of the @xmath3 decomposition .    as discussed above , one factor which could affect the @xmath3 decomposition is the rate at which ellipticity correlations drop off .",
    "the case when the density correlation falls off as @xmath132 implies that for large separations , the projected ellipticities fall off as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the angular separation . since @xmath135 , @xmath69 will be the same as @xmath75 , and @xmath70 will be the same as @xmath76 .",

    "more generally , the integrals of the tangential shape distortions can be directly related to the local electric distortion .",
    "thus @xmath1-modes are associated with either tangential or radial patterns , as shown in figure 2 ( left panel . )",
    "@xmath2-modes are also related to the circular distortion pattern , but these have an associated ` handedness ' or orientation , as shown in the right panel of figure 2 .",

    "assume the radial function to have the form of a mexican hat wavelet , which is the derivative of a gaussian function , @xmath165 and its fourier transform is simply @xmath166 for this particular choice , the convolution of @xmath151 with itself is @xmath167\\ , \\exp(-r^2/4\\sigma^2)$ ] .",
    "finally , using the fact that the fourier representation of @xmath168 is @xmath169 , we have , @xmath170 = { 1\\over 2\\sigma^2}\\,\\left({r^2\\over4 \\sigma^2}\\right)^2\\,e^{-r^2/4\\sigma^2}\\,.\\ ] ] this particular wavelet has the advantages that it is simple , analytic and very compact , falling off exponentially at large distances .",
    "in this section we address the direct analysis of real survey data .",
    "we first consider the extraction of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 correlators .",
    "for this purpose , one only needs to measure the two pairwise ellipticity correlation functions @xmath171 ( defined before eqn ( 15 ) ) for all pairs of galaxies as a function of separation , which has been done by van waerbeke et al , ( 2000 ) and does not depend on the geometry of the survey or its boundary shapes .",
    "this correlation function ( plus its error bars and the covariance matrix of errors ) contains all the second order statistics of the map , and is a complete and optimal two point description .",
    "we now have two functions , both of which contain noise , and our goal is to apply a rotation such that one function contains lensing signal and the other no lensing signal , but which will give an estimate of contamination from noise and intrinsic correlations .",
    "the current analyses effective have added the two correlations , which adds a function which contains lensing to one which contains no lensing but an equal amount of noise , which doubles the amount of noise we have .",
    "instead , we can define @xmath172 r'dr ' -6/r^4 \\int_0^r [ \\xi_+(r')+ \\xi_\\times(r ' ) ] r'^3dr'$ ] .",
    "we can now derive pure @xmath1-type and @xmath2-type correlators which depend only on correlations at separations less than @xmath65 , @xmath173 in the case of pure weak lensing , the @xmath2-type correlator should be consistent with pure noise , while @xmath69 contains all the lensing signal , and only half the noise .",
    "we have achieved the correlation function analogy of kaiser s 45 degree rotation : rotating all the images by 45 degrees swaps @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "one can also obtain expressions for the variances of the fields smoothed by a tophat filter with radius @xmath108 .",
    "this is done by convolving the correlation functions with a window which is proportional to the area of overlap between two circles of radius @xmath108 and separation @xmath65 , @xmath174 this again contains half as much noise power as the standard procedure of actually convolving the map and computing its variance , which is what all work to date has performed .",
    "this decomposition was performed directly on the correlator , and there exists no transformation on the shear map such that the correlation function of the transformed shear map is given by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : dummy ] ) .",
    "similarly , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : th ] ) is not identically equal to the tophat smoothed map variance .",
    "if one actually wants to make a map , the aperture shear decomposition eqn .",
    "( 28 ) allows one to make a local decomposed map , whose variance one can then measure .",
    "note that in making a map , one looses information near the boundaries , and variation in source counts leads to inhomogeneous signal - to - noise , decreasing the overall sensitivity to measuring the true correlation function .",
    "luckily the aperture mass approach also allows a direct computation of the same quantities from the correlation functions , as shown in eqn .",
    "here we have investigated the general decomposition of flat two dimensional spin-2 fields into so - called electric ( gradient ) and magnetic ( curl ) components .",
    "while this decomposition involves derivatives and is intrinsically non - local , we have shown how local correlations of the electric and magnetic components can be found given correlations in the components of the ellipticity ( equations 17 and 18 ) .",
    "for the case of power law correlations , this implies a relationship between the spectral index of the correlations and the relative amplitude of the different types of ellipticity correlations .    in addition , following kaiser et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we have shown how local estimators for the electric and magnetic modes can be constructed from circular integrals of the tangential and @xmath42 ( or @xmath16 and @xmath17 stokes parameters ) distortions respectively ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we calculated correlations of these local estimators and related them to the ellipticity correlations .",
    "this decomposition has important consequences when applied to the projected shapes of galaxies .",
    "gravitational lensing primarily produces electric modes , as does the tidal stretching of galaxies .",
    "however , as we have shown here , angular momentum couplings produce @xmath1 and @xmath2-modes in comparable amounts and one might expect that noise , telescope distortions and other sources of systematic errors will produce curl modes as well .",
    "thus the presence of @xmath2-modes will be useful for disentangling intrinsic correlations caused by angular momentum couplings from those induced by cosmic shear and from gravitational lensing .",
    "even if lensing distortions dominate , this decomposition will be useful as a means of estimating the levels of noise and systematic errors in the observations .",
    "in addition , it provides a means of reducing noise levels of lensing observations by a factor of @xmath175 ( kaiser 1995 . )    the prospects for isolating the contribution of @xmath2-modes using these local correlators are promising with several of the ongoing shallow redshift and imaging surveys presently taking data .",
    "these include the sloan dss ( www.sdss.org ) , 2df ( www.ast.cam.ac.uk/aao/2df ) , 2mass ( pegasus.phast.umass.edu ) , deep ( dls.bell-labs.com ) and the int wide field survey ( www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath176wfcsur/ ) .",
    "the low median redshift implies minimal contamination from the lensing signal and therefore an improvement in the signal to noise of the extraction .",
    "finally , most of these considerations apply equally well to the imminent observations of cmb polarization ( e.g. kamionkowski , kosowsky & stebbins 1997 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ) . in this case ,",
    "scalar fluctuations induce only @xmath1-modes , while noise and gravitational radiation induce both @xmath1 and @xmath2-modes . as in the case of galaxy shapes , these observations will be initially noise dominated , so these kinds of correlation analyses will be essential .",
    "the lessons we learn from the lensing data now available will be directly applicable to the polarization data when they become available in a few years time ."
