    "nowadays , a relevant topic of research in statistical physics is the characterization of metastable and non - equilibrium states of physical systems @xcite .",
    "multiple efforts have been made in order to explain this kind of behavior , but the discussion intensively continues because of the large variety and complexity of physical processes involved @xcite .    in this work we intend to present a more complete discussion of the statistical description previously sketched in ref .",
    "we expect to describe the statistical physics of a large class of metastable and stationary states .",
    "our main suggestion to deal with these situations is that statistical properties of the metastable or stationary non - equilibrium states depart from the gibbs thermal states in equilibrium in the following sense : _ the metastable or non - equilibrium configuration may be the results of an additional dynamical constraint , maintaining the system for a while in the metastable state , if the restriction is only an approximate one ; and retaining the system in a time independent configuration , in the case of non - equilibrium stationary states . after the removal of the condition , the system is allowed to evolve in a thermal state described by the bloch density matrix_. hence , the time independence of the statistical properties of the systems leads to commutation between the density matrix and the hamiltonian during the time for which the metastable or stationary state exists .",
    "as it was mentioned , we will assume that an extra constraint @xmath1 is conserved in time , then @xmath1 will also commute with the hamiltonian . in the large class of systems having a non - degenerate spectrum of the energy , the hamiltonian @xmath6 , the density matrix @xmath2 and the extra constraint @xmath1",
    "can be diagonalized in the same common basis of eigenstates .",
    "the same property is not necessarily valid when the energy spectrum is non degenerated . from now on",
    ", we will simply restrict the discussion to systems exhibiting the mentioned commutativity among @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that the extra constraint defines the metastable state .",
    "then , it is possible to note the existence of some related conserved constraints .",
    "a particular interesting one is given by the product operator @xmath7 .",
    "note , that the assumed commutativity of @xmath8 with @xmath1 implies the possibility of expressing @xmath1 as a function of @xmath9 the above remark , motivated in us the idea of constructing a special analytical form of the condition to be incorporated in the lagrange multiplier scheme for the maximization of the entropy .",
    "this condition will be constructed as a modified expectation value of the energy , in which in the density matrix in the usual mean value is substituted by the constraint function @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity results to be conserved as a direct consequence of the validity of the constraint @xmath1 .    as a result of the above construction",
    ", it follows that , when the additivity condition of the resulting statistical description is assumed to be valid for two approximately independent subsystems , the constraint function @xmath1  should have the tsallis homogeneous structure @xmath10 where @xmath5 is a real number to be determined .",
    "it should be underlined that this conclusion follows for systems in which the energy spectrum is sufficiently dense for to be considered as continuous . for such systems ,",
    "the analysis , seems to indicate an interpretation of the tsallis @xmath5 parameter as corresponding to the degree of homogeneity of the constraint @xmath1 after to be represented as a function of the density matrix @xmath2 .    in order to start investigating its implications ,",
    "the procedure was applied in this work to describe the experimental data obtained from the plasma experiment performed by  huang and driscoll @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the electron density were chosen as an input of an iterative procedure for solving the equations for the probability density @xmath9 the results predicted for the densities at radial distances at which the their values are not small , describe the experimental results with similar quality as the ones following from two theoretical schemes existing for this problem .",
    "they are the minimization of the enstrophy on one case and the maximization of the tsallis entropy in the other one @xcite .",
    "it is known that these procedures are equivalent and their applications to the considered problem are recognized as main studies existing in recent literature @xcite . in connection with the zone of small radial distances , both of the analysis describe this region with similar precision and their results are close to the experimental data . however , at large radial distances , where the density is small enough , their results strongly deviate from the experimental measurements reported by huang and driscoll @xcite .",
    "our results radically improve the outcome of the aforementioned theoretical procedures in this large distance region . in this sense",
    ", the presented approach gives a new description of the smooth vanishing tail of the density profile , which has been experimentally measured .",
    "each one of the alternative procedures needs to justify the presence of a non - analytical behavior of the density distributions in the region of the tail of small densities , as coming form the requirement of the non - negative character of the electron density . in the here proposed discussion",
    ", such a procedure is not becoming necessary and , as noted before , the dependence of the density as a function of the radial distance is predicted to smoothly decay .",
    "our procedure has been applied to the quasiequilibrium state of excitonic polaritons @xcite .",
    "these polaritons are quasibosonic quasiparticles arising from the strong interaction of excitons and confined light modes in a microcavity .",
    "a finite model is studied in ref . [ ] with a help of a master equation for the density matrix .",
    "the result is that the density matrix approximately commutes wit the hamiltonian .",
    "we assumed that the quasiequilibrium is the result of a constraint in phase space and showed that an analytical expression for the density matrix , resulting from our procedure gives a reasonable fit to the numerical results .    the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the basic elements of the proposed statistical description .",
    "section [ parameterq ] , then continues by arguing that the assumption of additivity in the statistical description implies that the constraint function should be a simple @xmath5 power of the density matrix . in section [ plasma ]",
    "the procedure is applied to describe the results of the plasma experiment of huang and driscoll .",
    "finally , section [ summary ] resume the results of the work .",
    "let us consider a physical system having a quantum dynamics described by a hamiltonian @xmath6 . in the gibbs approach ,",
    "the properties of the system in thermal equilibrium are contained in the bloch density matrix @xmath11 which satisfies @xmath12=0 $ ] and determines the conditional maximum of the entropy functional  @xmath13+\\alpha(tr[\\rho h]-e)+\\\\ &   + \\beta(tr[\\rho]-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are lagrange multipliers corresponding to imposing two conditions : the conservation of the energy @xmath16 and the normalization of the trace of the density operator @xmath2 .",
    "the latter condition is placed in order to furnish a probability interpretation to the diagonal elements of @xmath2 , this is @xmath17=1 $ ] .",
    "eventually , additional conserved quantities can be added by also introducing their corresponding multipliers .",
    "our main assumption in this work is that during a large relaxation time @xmath18 , the considered physical systems are forbidden to reach the thermal equilibrium state , as a consequence of the action of extra constraints .",
    "these restrictions are assumed to be dynamically generated and able to obstructs during macroscopic time intervals the standard evolution which normally drops the density matrix to the bloch form . in other words , we propose the existence of a conserved quantity @xmath1 , whose effects over the motion of the system is to delay the usual evolution , then leading the system to an intermediate equilibrium state differing from the gibbs thermal one : the metastable or non equilibrium stationary state .",
    "therefore , the system is compelled to remain in those states during the time lapse in that the extra constraint works . thus , as a result of the precedent assumptions we will have : @xmath19=0.\\ ] ] therefore , the constraint @xmath1 and the density matrix @xmath2 both commute with the hamiltonian . as mentioned before , in the large class of systems in which @xmath6 has a non degenerated spectrum ,",
    "it is possible to simultaneously diagonalize @xmath20 @xmath2 and @xmath1 , within a common basis of eigenfunctions .",
    "however , in a more general situation , we will simply restrict the discussion to the cases in that all the three quantities commute among them .",
    "thus , the conserved constraint @xmath1 can be expressed as a certain function of the density matrix @xmath21 . from the mentioned assumptions",
    "if follows that the quantity @xmath22 is also conserved @xmath23 &   = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] further , the evolution of the system in the considered metastable or stationary states , also implies the time invariance of the specially constructed expectation value  @xmath24}{tr[f(\\rho)]}.\\ ] ] now , let us precisely state our main dynamical principle : the metastable and stationary states are determined by the maximization of entropy @xmath0 subjected to the conditions of conservation of normalization , energy and the aforementioned expectation value .",
    "then , the usual constraints plus the extra one , after multiplied by their corresponding lagrange multipliers , are added to the entropy functional to construct the modified form of the gibbs lagrange multiplier scheme .",
    "the functional takes the explicit form@xmath13+\\alpha(tr[\\rho h]-e)+\\\\ &   + \\beta(tr[\\rho]-1)+\\gamma(\\frac{tr[f(\\rho)h]}{tr[f(\\rho)]}-e_{c})\\\\ &   = -\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\log(p_{i})+\\alpha(\\sum_{i}p_{i}\\epsilon_{i}-e)+\\beta ( \\sum_{i}p_{i}-1)+\\\\ & + \\gamma(\\frac{\\sum_{i}f(p_{i})\\epsilon_{i}}{\\sum_{i}f(p_{i})}-e_{f}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , are the diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath26 .",
    "let us now consider implications of the modified statistical physics being introduced .",
    "they follow after assuming the additivity in the statistical description for the combination of two quasi independent systems .",
    "that is , each one of the subsystems will be assumed to be in the same kind of metastable state , showing analogous statistical properties as the whole body .",
    "then , let us consider a pair of such systems that weakly interact between them .",
    "any one of the bodies is considered in the same kind of metastable state .",
    "the entropy and the constraint functions of the first system can be written as @xmath27    analogously , the same quantities for the second system may be expressed as @xmath28 now let us consider that the description is also valid for the combination of both systems .",
    "then , the entropy and constraints can be expressed as follows @xmath29 where the pair  @xmath30 indicates the state of the composite system in terms of the indices of the states of the single systems as @xmath31 .",
    "the assumed separability of the two bodies allows to write a relation for the probability of the combined states @xmath32 in the following way @xmath33 thus , the probability constraint for the individual subsystems is valid for the probability constraint of the composite system .",
    "the additivity of entropies follows in a similar way @xmath34 we have the same outcome for the addition of energies @xmath35 let us come to the main new element considered in this section .",
    "now we assume that the @xmath5-expectation value of the energy also satisfies the statistical independence condition for the combined system as@xmath36 therefore , the @xmath5-expectation value also satisfies the additivity properties , as follows@xmath37 however , this condition also imposes a strong restriction on the possible forms of the function @xmath1 defining the newly introduced expectation value .",
    "in order to see this central point of the presentation , the statistical independence condition ( [ indep ] ) will be rewritten .",
    "consider @xmath1 as expanded in powers of its argument @xmath38 , in the general form @xmath39 combining eqs.([indep ] ) and ( [ expansion ] ) , it is possible to write    @xmath40    after a suitable rearrangement of the variables , it follows @xmath41 next , let us assume that the domain of the probability @xmath4 for all the values indices @xmath42 is a continuous set .",
    "then , the completeness of the basis formed by the powers of a variable implies  @xmath43 at this point , let us suppose that @xmath44 for a particular value of @xmath45 .",
    "then , the validity of the above relation directly implies that @xmath46 for all the values of @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the explicit form of the operator @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 can be written in the following simple way @xmath48 the parameter @xmath5 is a real number which value should be dynamically determined . the above conclusion complete the argue indicating the tsallis mean value structure of the modified average imposing the dynamical constraint @xmath1 .",
    "let us examine in this subsection the @xmath1 dependent modified expectation value . as noted",
    "before , its most interesting property is the full coincidence with the tsallis @xmath5-expectation value of the energy @xmath49 where the index @xmath5 is the power of the probability in ( [ qtsallis ] ) .",
    "the modified entropy functional takes the form @xmath50 and the lagrange extremum equations following from the functional are@xmath51 their explicit calculation leads to the following set of coupled equations for the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath2@xmath52    after some algebra , we obtain the integral relation @xmath53 the last expression establishes a connection among the entropy , energy and the lagrange multipliers . as usual",
    ", it seems useful to be employed in constructing generalizations of the free energy and other thermodynamical potentials and relations .",
    "however , we will not deal with this discussion here .",
    "in this section , we apply the statistical procedure being investigated to an important example : the relaxation of a 2d turbulence to a metaequilibrium state . a relevant experiment related with this problem",
    "was performed and discussed by huang and driscoll @xcite .",
    "they compared results from several theoretical approaches to their measured data .",
    "the theoretical scheme which furnish the best approximation , is the minimum enstrophy model .",
    "the experiment considered the 2d dynamics of a electron plasma fluid .",
    "the authors were able to identify and measure properties of a metaequilibrium state ( mes ) for a plasma sample in which a turbulence initially occurs within a rotating magnetized cylindrical electron column .",
    "the turbulence relaxes to a long - lasting metaequilibria state with axial symmetry .",
    "the relevant conserved quantities of the electron column in the mes are the following : energy @xmath6 , entropy @xmath0 , angular momentum @xmath54 and number of particles @xmath55 .",
    "we start from the poisson equation in order to relate the potential @xmath56 to the particle density @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the potential and the particle density ( in the international system of units ) .",

    "@xcite all magnitudes are expressed in a special set of units , in which the cylinder radius is equal to 1 .",

    "[ ] as @xmath84 , and the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) as @xmath85 .",
    "the procedure starts by evaluating the vector @xmath86 for all its components @xmath87 , in the initial density data @xmath78 .",
    "then , this vector becomes a function of the lagrange multipliers and the value of @xmath5 .",
    "next , the values of those parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 that minimize the quadratic difference @xmath91 were determined .",
    "finalizing this first step , the set of obtained multipliers were substituted in the expression for @xmath85 together with the initial density @xmath78 , defining in this way @xmath92 as the l.h.s . of ( [ extremo2 ] ) .",
    "the new density data to be employed in the next iteration @xmath93 were determined from @xmath94/\\left(\\sum_k 2 \\pi r_k \\delta r_k \\exp[l^1_k]\\right)$ ] , where the denominator shows that the normalization is imposed .",
    "the new step continues by writing a new vector @xmath95 in which the density @xmath93 is substituted in @xmath96 and the parameters are set free again .",

    "the l.h.s goes from -6742 in the first step , down to 0.1 in the last one .",
    "thus , the numerical solution of the system was taken as the @xmath100 iterative results for the density values @xmath101 and the set of parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .     vs. the radial position .",
    "the squares show the experimental result @xmath105 of ref .",

    "the diamonds indicate the density evaluated from the iterative solution of the maximum entropy principle subject to the constraint @xmath67 : @xmath106 .,width=472 ]    in fig.[figura1 ] the data of huang - driscoll  @xcite are depicted in comparison with the ones predicted by the restricted minimum enstrophy model and our iterative solution .",
    "the values of the parameters obtained from the iterative procedure are given by @xmath107    both for the parameters and the physical magnitudes , the errors are given by the difference between the value of the quantity in the last iteration @xmath100 and in the previous @xmath108 .",
    "the values obtained for the physical magnitudes are @xmath109 which are reasonably close to the experimental values @xcite given the natural presence of experimental errors and our discrete approximation of the integrals .",
    "the experimental values are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it can be noted that the results for the lagrange multipliers associated to the energy constraint , the tsallis constraint like condition an the number of particles requirement are relatively high quantities .",
    "this curious outcome results to be compatible with the resulting value of @xmath5 which is very close to the unit . in this case , the only way in which the finite differences between the gibbs and the present result for the density could arise is due to those large values for the multipliers .",
    "this is so because because the additional constraint for such a value of @xmath5 very close to the unit is very close to the gibbs energy constraint .",

    "the observed property is also fulfilled for the multiplier of the number of particles @xmath112 .",

    "they were now calculated by taking a trapezoidal approach : @xmath113 , with @xmath114 .",
    "the obtained results are basically the same as the ones showed here for : the density solution of eq.([extremo2 ] ) , the magnitudes of the lagrange multipliers and the convergence of l.h.s from eq.([integral ] ) to zero .    the fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] , indicates that our solution reasonably agrees with the experimental data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the points with bigger values of the density",

    "in contrast , the present discussion correctly predicts the experimental smooth decay of the density to zero at large distances .",
    "thus , in that region , the proposed procedure is able to avoid the singularity predicted by the minimal enstrophy analysis .",
    "it can be concluded that the performed numerical study shows that the statistical mechanics proposal investigated in this work , reasonably well describes the metaequilibrium state found in ref .",
    ".,width=472 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ gibbs ] and for comparison purposes , the obtained density is plotted in common with the density evaluated from the same procedure but in which the tsallis like constraint @xmath67 is not considered : @xmath118 .",
    "that is : the conserved magnitudes are energy , angular  momentum and normalization .",
    "both results drastically deviate from each other at small radial distances .",
    "a recent work studying the behavior of a similar system @xcite establishes that in certain ranges of the ratio @xmath119 it could dominate an evolution guided by a near maximum entropy principle ( for bigger ratio ) , or alternatively , a minimum enstrophy ( for smaller ratio ) .",
    "the huang - driscoll experiment furnishes a primer of the second case , since it is approximately well described by a minimum enstrophy state .",
    "therefore , as we are able to reasonable well describe their data @xcite , our results deviate from the gibbs behavior , and furnish support to the additional constraint argued here to be relevant in determining metastable and stationary states .    it should be underlined that an issue that is yet puzzling for us , is the reason for that very small deviations from the unit of the @xmath5 number ( and its associated large values of the multipliers ) , are precisely the ones leading to a reasonable good match between the numerical solution and the quasiequilibrium plasma density .",
    "we expect to be able of considering this question elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we propose a modification of the gibbs approach in order to deal with stationary and metastable equilibrium states of physical systems . as usual , the time evolution is assumed to maximize the value of the entropy @xmath0 by satisfying the standard constraints , like constant energy and normalization .",
    "however , the description of the no - equilibrium states is searched by considering that those configurations are stabilized by the presence of an extra constraint @xmath1 , being ( approximately ) conserved in the motion .",
    "the constraint , being restricted to be time invariant , is assumed to play the central role in stopping the evolution of the entropy to its maximal value in the gibbs thermal equilibrium state .",
    "afterwards , we assume a situation in which the description , which is valid for a composite system formed by two quasi independent subsystems , is also valid for each of them .",
    "this supposition implies that , if the constraint @xmath120 commutes with density matrix , then @xmath121 has a simplified dependence on @xmath4 of the form @xmath3 .",
    "one of the main outcomes of the work arises from this conclusion : the suggestion of an interpretation of the tsallis @xmath5 parameter as the order of the homogeneity of the constraint @xmath1 , when it is expressed as a function of the density matrix .",
    "remarkably , for small and medium radial distances the approach furnish results of similar quality as the ones given by the extremum of the enstrophy and tsallis procedures .",
    "but , moreover , the smooth tail of the experimental density distribution at large distances is also predicted .",
    "therefore , the analysis becomes able of avoiding the non - analyticity shown by the density curve in the mentioned alternative schemes , by describing the density decay tail of the huang - driscoll experimental data at large radial distances .",
    "finally , it can be referred , that the proposed description has been also applied in ref . [ ] , to a gas of polaritons contained within a quantum dot pumped by an optical resonator .",
