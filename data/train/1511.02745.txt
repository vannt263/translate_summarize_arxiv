    "the existence of a magnetic flux tube penetrating a type ii superconductor , named * vortex * , was first demonstrated by abrikosov @xcite , by using the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .",
    "some years later , nielsen and olesen @xcite have shown , by using a classical relativistic field theory , composed by higgs fields interacting with abelian one , that presents spontaneously gauge symmetry broken , contains static cylindrically symmetric solution carrying a magnetic flux .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the vortex solution .",
    "the equations of motion associated for this system form a set of coupled non - linear differential equation , that , in general , has no closed solutions .",
    "the analysis of the influence of this system on the geometry of the spacetime was analyzed numerically by garfinkle @xcite and laguna @xcite many years ago . in these papers",
    "the authors showed that , the vortex has a inner structure characterized by a non - vanishing core carrying a magnetic flux , whose extension is determined by the energy scale where the symmetry is broken .",
    "two length scales naturally appear , the one related with the extension of the magnetic flux proportional to the inverse of vector field mass , @xmath5 , and the other associated with the inverse of the scalar field mass , @xmath6 . the latter being the radius that the scalar field reaches its vacuum value .",
    "moreover the authors also verify that asymptotically the surface perpendicular to the vortex corresponds to a minkowski one minus a wedge .",
    "a special vortex solution that satisfy the bogomolnyi - prasad - somerfield ( bps ) limit , presents both masses equal , i.e. , @xmath7 . for this case linet @xcite",
    "was able to find , in the infinity electric charge and higgs field self - coupling limit , exact solution for the metric tensor , which is determined in terms of the linear energy density of the string .",
    "in this limit , the surface perpendicular to the vortex - line solution has a conical structure , and the space around this object corresponds to an idealized cosmic string .    according to the big bang theory ,",
    "the universe has been expanding and cooling . during its expansion , the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries leads the universe to a series of phase transitions . in most interesting model of high - energy physics ,",
    "the formation of topological defects such as domain walls , monopoles , cosmic string , among others are predicted to occur @xcite .",
    "these topologically stable structures have a number of interesting observable consequences , the detection of which would provide an important link between cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the various type of topological defects , the most studied . though the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out them as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , cosmic strings give rise to a number of interesting physical effects such as gamma rays bursts @xcite , the emission of gravitational waves @xcite and the generation of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "string - like defects also appear in a number of condensed matter systems , including liquid crystals and graphene made structures .",
    "the complete analysis of the behavior of a quantum charged field in the neighborhood of an abelian nielsen and olesen ( no ) string must take into account not only the influence of the geometry of the spacetime , but also the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "two distinct analysis can be mentioned : @xmath8 the first one is to consider the string as an idealized linear topological defect , having a magnetic field running along it .",
    "this case can be treated analytically .",
    "@xmath9 the second approach is to consider the non - zero thickness for the string .",
    "unfortunately this problem is analytically intractable . in the idealized model ,",
    "the conical structure of the spacetime modifies the zero - point vacuum fluctuation of quantized fields inducing non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vev ) for important physical observable .",
    "this analysis has been developed in many papers for scalar , fermionic and electromagnetic fields ( see , for instance , references given in @xcite ) ; moreover considering the presence magnetic flux , additional polarization effects associated with charged quantum fields take place @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular this magnetic flux induces non - vanishing current densities , @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated for scalar fields in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis of induced fermionic currents in higher - dimensional cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a magnetic flux have been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all these analysis",
    ", the authors have shown that induced vacuum current densities along the azimuthal direction appear if the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one has a nonzero fractional part .",
    "moreover , induced fermionic and scalar current densities in compactified cosmic string spacetimes have been considered in @xcite and @xcite .    because the analysis of a quantum system in a realistic model for the no vortex can not be exactly analyzed , an intermediate approach is to assume an approximated model for this string , that consists to consider the spacetime produced by the string as being conical everywhere , but having a non - zero thickness magnetic field surrounding it . in this way",
    ", some improvements were obtained in the calculations of the vev of some physical observable when compared with the idealized case .",
    "this approach was used in @xcite to calculate the vev of charged scalar and fermionic energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "more recently the scalar vacuum current induced by a magnetic flux in a cosmic string considering a non - vanishing core has been developed in @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the vacuum polarization effects present two contributions . the first one associated with a zero - thickness magnetic flux .",
    "this contribution is a periodic function of the magnetic flux inside the tube , with the period equal to the quantum flux .",
    "the second contribution , named core - induced contribution , is not a periodic function of the flux .",
    "in fact the core - induced contribution depends on the total magnetic flux inside the core .",
    "three different configurations of magnetic flux that allow us to obtain exact wave - function solutions were considered : @xmath8 a magnetic field on a cylindrical shell , @xmath9 a magnetic field proportional to @xmath1 , and finally @xmath11 a homogeneous magnetic field inside the tube .    motivated by these results , we decided in this paper to analyze the induced fermionic current density in the system defined above , i.e. , an idealized cosmic string surrounded by a magnetic field confined in a tube of finite radius . in order to do that we shall explicitly calculate the wave - functions inside and outside the tube for each case , and by the summation method we shall develop the calculation of induced fermionic current .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section [ geometry ]",
    "we describe the background geometry of the spacetime and the configuration of the magnetic fields .",
    "we provide the general structure of the complete set of normalized positive- and negative - energy fermionic mode functions , which can be adapted for each magnetic field configuration .",
    "these functions obey the continuity boundary on the surface of the cylindrical tube of radius @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ mode ] , by using the mode - summation method , we show that the vevs for the charge density , the radial and axial current densities vanish .",
    "only azimuthal current density is induced .",
    "then we evaluate the renormalized vev of this current density .",
    "we show that the later can be decomposed in two parts : the first one corresponds to the induced current by a zero - thickness magnetic flux in the geometry of an idealized cosmic string , and the second one is induced by the non - zero core of the magnetic tube .",
    "the latter is calculated , separately , for the three kinds of magnetic flux considered .",
    "the behavior of them are discussed in various asymptotic regions of the parameters .",
    "we also present some plots associated with the core - induced azimuthal current exhibiting its behavior as function of the most relevant physical variables .",
    "our most relevant conclusions are summarized in section [ conclu ] . in the appendix [ appenda ] we present some recurrence relations involving whittaker functions @xmath12 , needed by us to construct the fermionic wave - functions in a simpler form .",
    "we would like to point out that these relations were not found in the literature . because these relations may be useful for anybody else in the future",
    ", we decided to explicitly present them . throughout the paper",
    "we use the units with @xmath13 .",
    "the background geometry associated with an idealized cosmic string along the @xmath14-axis , can be given , by using cylindrical coordinates , through the line element below : @xmath15 where the coordinates take values in range @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 associated with the planar angle deficit is related to the mass per unit length of the string , @xmath21 , by @xmath22 .",
    "the quantum dynamic of a massive charged spinor field in curved space - time and in the presence of an electromagnetic four - vector potential , @xmath23 , is described by the dirac equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the dirac matrices in curved space - time and @xmath26 is the spin connection .",
    "both matrices are given in terms of the flat space - time dirac matrices , @xmath27 , by the relations @xmath28    in the above expression @xmath29 represents the basis tetrad satisfying the relation @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being the minkowski space - time metric tensor .",
    "the system that we want to analyse takes into account three different configurations of magnetic fields .",
    "they are : @xmath8 a magnetic field on a cylindrical shell of radius @xmath0 , @xmath9 a magnetic field proportional to @xmath1 , and finally @xmath11 a homogeneous magnetic field inside the tube . in these three cases , the axis of the infinitely long tube of radius @xmath0 coincides with the cosmic string . in order to reproduce these three configurations of magnetic field and proceed with our calculations , we consider the potential vector given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 for the first model , @xmath34 for the two second models",
    ", we can represent the radial function @xmath35 by : @xmath36 with @xmath37 in the expressions above , @xmath38 represents the heaviside function , and @xmath39 the total magnetic flux .    to find the complete set of mode of fermionic wave - functions for the problem under consideration , we shall use the standard representation of the flat space dirac matrices : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the pauli matrices .",
    "we take the tetrad basis as follow : @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 identifies the rows of the matrix . with this choice",
    ", the gamma matrices take the form @xmath44 where we have introduced the @xmath45 matrices for @xmath46 : @xmath47 for this case the spin connection and combination appearing in the dirac equation we find @xmath48 then the dirac equation take the form @xmath49    for positive - energy solutions , assuming the time - dependence of the eigenfunctions in the form @xmath50 and decomposing the spinor @xmath51 into the upper @xmath52 and lower @xmath53 components , we find the following equations @xmath54\\psi_{-}=0 \\   , \\ ] ] @xmath55\\psi_{+}=0   \\   .\\ ] ] substituting the function @xmath56 from the second equation into the first one , we obtain the second order differential equation for the spinor @xmath57 : @xmath58\\psi_{+}&=&0   \\    .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the same equation is obtained for @xmath56 .",

    "these configurations of the magnetic fields have been used in @xcite to analyze the non - relativistic quantum motion of a spin @xmath73 charged particle with a gyromagnetic ratio @xmath74 interacting with magnetic field and considering the presence of a magnetic dipole interaction ; moreover , the corresponding relativistic analysis has bee developed in @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "only two configurations of magnetic field have been considered , the homogeneous field and the cylindrical shell with a delta - dirac distribution .    for the outside region , @xmath71",
    ", there is no magnetic field and the vector potential given by , @xmath75 being @xmath39 the magnetic flux .",

    "the dominant contribution in comes from the contribution of large @xmath255 . to find the leading term it is convenient to introduce a new variable @xmath256 , and use the uniform expansion for large order for the modified bessel functions @xcite .",
    "however , before to do that , we would like to notice that , changing @xmath257 the summation over _ j _ keeps unchanged , but the parameter @xmath258 change as @xmath259 and @xmath260 . if , in addition , we also change @xmath261 , then @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "it means that , when we make @xmath257 and @xmath261 we have @xmath264 . on basis of this analysis , and",
    "considering @xmath265 , the behavior of the core - induced azimuthal current near the boundary is given by , @xmath266 because we are considering @xmath267 , from now on we use the approximation , @xmath268 .",
    "for the three models , it is necessary to find the leading term of @xmath269 for large value of @xmath228 .",
    "for the first two models , this term is obtained by using the uniform expansion for large order for the modified bessel functions for the first model and the asymptotic expansion for the corresponding whittaker functions for the second model . after some intermediate and long steps",
    ", we found that both leading terms coincide and are given below , @xmath270 where @xmath271 .",
    "the third model converge to the same result . in order to see that we express the whittaker function in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite , @xmath272 , and",
    "use the expansion below for the latter , @xmath273 finally we use the uniform expansion for large order for the bessel function .",
    "so , for the three models , the core - induced azimuthal current density is given by @xmath274 where @xmath275 .",
    "using the approximation @xmath276 , and observing that the denominator of the integrand in can be approximate to unity , for the three models , we have : @xmath277 solving the above integral we have @xmath278 here , we must notice that the current density diverges near the boundary .",
    "because the zero - thickness azimuthal current , @xmath279 , presents a finite value near the boundary , we can conclude that , in this region , the total azimuthal current , is dominated by the core - induced contribution .",
    "an alternative way to show that the three models provide the same result for the core - induced azimuthal current near the boundary , is given by analyzing the radial differential equations and given in appendix [ appenda ] for large value of @xmath228 .",
    "replacing the parameter @xmath149 by @xmath280 , specifically for , we get : the equation is similar to by changing @xmath258 by @xmath281 . ]",
    "@xmath282 substituting , or into the above equation , it is possible to see that the solutions can be written in a general form below : @xmath283 where @xmath284 is equal to unity for the first model , eq . , and for the second and third models , it reads , @xmath285 and @xmath286 respectively .",
    "because the coefficient @xmath116 depends on the ratio of the two radial functions , @xmath212 and @xmath211 , for large value of @xmath228 , the leading term of this ration is : @xmath287 consequently the three models behave , in this limit , in a similar way .",
    "after these above general descriptions of the core - induced azimuthal current , we would like to provide additional informations which are not easily observed by the analytical expressions for it .",
    "so , in order to full fill this lack , in the rest of this section we will develop some numerical evaluations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the dependence of the core - induced azimuthal current density , @xmath288 , as function of @xmath289 considering @xmath290 and @xmath291 . on the left plot , we present the behavior for the current induced by the cylindrical shell of magnetic field , taking into account positive and negative value for @xmath292 . in order to provide a better understanding about this current ,",
    "on the right plot we exhibit its behavior as function of @xmath289 , for the three different models of magnetic fields considering @xmath293 . by this plot",
    "we can infer that for a given point outside the tube , the intensity of the current induced by the first model is the biggest one .    \" , as function of @xmath289 for the values @xmath290 and @xmath291 . in the left plot we consider the current induced by the magnetic field configuration of the first model , and taking @xmath293 and @xmath294 . on the right plot",

    "we consider the current induced by the magnetic field configuration of the first model , and taking @xmath293 and @xmath294 . on the right plot",
    "we compare the intensity of the core - induced current for the three different models of magnetic fields considering @xmath293.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    another analysis that deserves to be developed is related with dependence of the core - induced azimuthal current with the parameter which codifies the presence of the cosmic string , @xmath20 .",
    "so , in fig [ fig2 ] , we display , for the magnetic field concentrated in a cylindrical shell , the behavior of @xmath288 as function of @xmath289 for @xmath295 . as we can see the intensity of the current increases with @xmath20 . for this plot",

    "in this paper we have investigated the influence of the conical topology of the spacetime and the finite core effect on the vacuum expectation value of fermionic current densities induced by magnetic fluxes . in the model",
    "considered we have adopted that the geometry of the spacetime corresponds to an idealized cosmic string everywhere , surrounded by a magnetic tube of radius @xmath0 . in this tube",
    "three different configurations of magnetic fields have been taken into account : a cylindrical shell , a field decaying with @xmath1 and finally a homogeneous magnetic field . in order to develop these analysis we had to construct the normalized fermionic wave - function for the region outside the tube , and calculated the fermionic current densities by using the mode summation method , as shown in and .",
    "this complete set of the fermionic wave - function was constructed by imposing continuity condition for the wave - functions in the regions inside and outside the tube , at the boundary , @xmath110 .",
    "these functions were given by and , respectively .",
    "as to the normalization condition , it determines the values of the interior radial functions at the boundary , see .",
    "although the magnetic field vanishes outside the tube , the magnetic field inside the tube induced a non - vanishing only an azimuthal current density in the exterior region .",
    "this outside current is consequence of two type of effects : the aharonov - bohm - like effect , and the direct interaction of the charged fermionic field with the magnetic field inside the core .",
    "this phenomenon is explicitly manifested in the structure of the induced current .",
    "the latter been decomposed in two distinct contributions : the first one depends only on the fractional part of the ratio of the total magnetic flux by the quantum one .",
    "it is given in and is a periodic function of the total flux with the period equal to quantum flux .",
    "the second contribution named core - induced given by , in general is not a periodic function of the magnetic flux and depends on the total magnetic flux inside the core . by general analysis",
    "we could observe that the core - induced azimuthal current decays with @xmath205 for @xmath201 ( see ) .",
    "for the zero - thickness azimuthal current the corresponding decay is @xmath208 for @xmath207 , consequently the latter dominates the total azimuthal current . for @xmath209 ,",
    "both contributions are of the same order .",
    "we have also analyzed the core - induced current for two other asymptotic regions of the parameters . in these analysis",
    "we have explicitly used the solutions for the radial function inside the tube for the three different models of magnetic flux . given in the appendix [ appenda ] . ] for massless field and at large distance from the core , the result was given by eq . , and explicitly we see that this current decays with @xmath253 for large distance from the tube . comparing this result with the corresponding one for the massless limit of the zero - thickness azimuthal current wiche decays with @xmath254 , we conclude that for large distance the total azimuthal current , is dominated by the zero - thickness contribution . for point near the tube core , the core - induced current diverges with @xmath300 , as shown by .",
    "so this contribution is dominant in this region .",
    "finally we have also provide , by using numerical evaluation , the behavior of the core - induced current as function of several physical quantities relevant in our analysis . in figure 1",
    "we have two plots . in the left plot",
    "an expected result is presented .",
    "the current changes its sign when we change the sign of @xmath292 . in the right plot",

    "it is shown that the intensity of the current induced by the first model is the biggest one . in figure 2",
    ", we exhibit the behavior of current density for the first model as function of @xmath289 and fixed value of @xmath292 for different values of @xmath20 . by this plot",
    "we can infer that increasing @xmath20 the intensity of the current also increases .",
    "( although this latter numerical analysis was presented only for the first model , for the other two models the current behaves in a similar way . ) in figure 3 , we have displayed current as function of the intensity of the magnetic flux . in the left plot",
    "we have considered only the first model fixed @xmath289 and varying @xmath20 .",
    "this plot reinforces the fact that the intensity of the current increases with @xmath20 ; moreover , it shows that the current is not a periodic function of the flux .",
    "the right plot exhibits the behavior of the core - induced current , for the three models , for fixed value of @xmath20 .",
