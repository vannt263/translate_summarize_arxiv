    "one interesting feature in the superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 ( t@xmath3 = 40 k)@xcite is the possibility of coexistence of two energy gaps",
    ". this immediately leads to many intriguing questions , like whether the two gaps follow @xmath4(t ) and share the same critical temperature .",
    "there have been numerous tunneling spectroscopic studies to investigate this phenomenon at low temperatures .",
    "most of these studies are performed with scanning tunneling microscope@xcite or point contact@xcite . to provide the needed stability for temperature and field dependence studies",
    ", we have synthesized planar tunnel junctions@xcite on bulk mgb@xmath0 with pb as the counter electrode .",
    "as indicated in figure 1,@xcite the major peak ( @xmath5 ) in most of our junctions occurs consistently around 2 mev .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the bcs value . the second gap ( @xmath6 ) appears as a small feature at around 9 mev . for conductance curves when pb is normal",
    ", we can fit the data with a simple model by mixing two bcs density of states ( with energy gaps @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) at a ratio of c. a depairing term @xmath7 is introduced to account for different depairing effects , and barrier strength z is also included to account for the zero bias offset by andreev reflection@xcite .",
    "thermal broadening is included at the particular temperature of the fitting .",
    "c , @xmath7 , and z are determined by the curve at temperature = 7.78 k above pb @xmath8 7.2 k. they have the best fitted values of 0.064 , 0.95 mev , and 1.33 mev respectively .",
    "these values are then fixed for all subsequent fittings at higher temperatures . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the only adjustable parameters for higher temperature curves .      the temperature dependence of the two energy gaps is shown in the right insert of figure 1 .",
    "it is clear that both energy gaps follow a bcs - like behavior and both gaps survive up to the bulk t@xmath3 of mgb@xmath0 . from this",
    "we can conclude that the commonly observed small energy gap is not a result of surface degradation , but a true bulk property of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath5(0 ) and @xmath6(0 ) are 1.8 mev and 8.2 mev respectively , and the ratio @xmath6/@xmath5 is about 4.5 through out the temperature range .",
    "this ratio is close to both the theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally suggested@xcite values .",
    "the left insert in figure 1 shows the field dependence of the major peak position at 4.2 k. at low fields , this corresponds to the sum of pb gap ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen that there is a discontinuity in the peak position at the critical field of pb ( @xmath11 , when pb ceases to be superconducting .",
    "the peak position corresponds to @xmath12 at all higher fields . at a field of about 3.2 t",
    "most of our junctions `` collapse '' into josephson tunneling and the change is not reversible .      the behavior of one of these josephson junctions is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the josephson tunneling is between mgb@xmath0 and pb .",
    "the normal resistance ( @xmath13 ) varies only very slightly with temperature .",
    "@xmath14 is estimated to be about 2.1 mv ( insert , fig .",
    "2 ) for the curve at 4.2 k. if we assume @xmath15 and @xmath16 1.08 mev , we can estimate @xmath12 to be 1.75 mev .",
    "this is consistent with our result from the quasiparticle tunneling discussed above .",
