    "the so - called complex networks theory is now an accepted branch of physics and , in pariticular , of statistical physics . in fact , networks are mainly studied by means of those tools developed in the traditional field of statistical mechanics and this has lead to the definition of concepts and methods formally analogue to those used there @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful concepts is the one of _ ensemble _ , whose definition mimicks the traditional one : a set of networks each one having an associated probability coefficient , used to compute the average of some topological property of interest @xcite .",
    "the less statistically - biased way to build an esemble is by means of the maxent procedure , that is the maximization of the shannon entropy under some imposed contraints @xcite : a number of different ensembles can be defined by varying the number and the type of constraints .",
    "the main difficulty with this procedure is the calculation of the partition function for such ensembles , leading to a closed - form function : however , if linear constraints are chosen , a smart choice of the support greatly simplifies the calculations @xcite .",
    "the far most common choice is to consider the set of all graphs with the same number of nodes ( say @xmath3 ) and with a number of links varying from zero to the maximum . in what follows",
    "we will consider only binary networks , so that only two possibilities are given for each pair of nodes : they are connected ( and there is one link between them ) or not ( and zero links are present between them ) .",
    "this implies that the maximum number of links is @xmath1 for binary , undirected networks ( the total number of undirected pairs , given @xmath3 objects ) and @xmath2 for binary , directed networks ( the total number of directed pairs , given @xmath3 objects ) .",
    "if we consider the total number of nodes pairs as the available volume to store the given particles ( that is , the directed or undirected links ) we can identify the collection of graphs defined above as the usual _ grandcanonical ensemble _ in physics , characterized by the three constraints @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the volume ( the total number of nodes pairs ) , @xmath6 is the chemical potential ( controlling for the average number of particles / links ) and @xmath7 is the temperature ( controlling for the average value of the energy : a physical definiton of energy adaptable to networks - even if maybe unnecessary - is still missing but attempts to include it in the set of quantites imposable as networks contraints have already been made @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , as long as the volume of the system does not change and the number of particles changes , the only meaningful identification is with the grandcanonical ensemble ( in fact , neither the microcanonical , or @xmath8 , nor the canonical , or @xmath9 , ensemble satisfy these requests @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that allowing for the number of links to vary , greatly simplifies the calculations involving the partition function , thus making the grandcanonical ensemble a powerful tool to solve analytical models .",
    "however , despite the easiness in carrying on the calculations on this support , no efforts have been made to characterize it from a mathematical point of view .    in the next sections ,",
    "an aswer to this question will be provided ( and with an abuse of language , we will call `` ensemble '' only the support of the distribution , disregarding the type of distribution defined over it ) .",
    "the explicit generation of the grandcanonical ensemble of binary networks can be realized by a tree - like process .",
    "let us consider binary , undirected networks for simplicity .",
    "the pairs of nodes can be double - indexed ( i.e. @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and ignoring , as usual in network theory , the diagonal elements ) and listed according to a double - order : firstly , by ordering the index @xmath12 and , then , the index @xmath13 .",
    "for example , with @xmath14 nodes we would have the following @xmath15 pairs :    @xmath16    these undirected pairs will be the vertices of our tree",
    ". in @xmath15 steps we will build all the branches of our tree , whose `` leaves '' will be the matrices constituting the grandcanonical ensemble .",
    "this procedure , even if long , makes the mechanism leading to the definition of this kind of ensemble clear .",
    "note that the double index leads to the definition of a matrix ( the adjacency matrix ) , usually indicated with @xmath17 and whose elements , the @xmath18s , represent the pairs of nodes under consideration : @xmath19 indicates that the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are linked ; @xmath20 indicates that the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not linked .",
    "[ tree ] shows the first four ( out of six ) steps leading to the definition of the grandcanonical ensemble of binary networks with @xmath14 .",
    "let us start from the first pair of nodes and decide if the vertices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are linked or not ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) , the two choices corresponding to the first two branches .",
    "after the first pair , let us consider the next one , @xmath25 , and ask again if the nodes @xmath21 and @xmath26 are linked or not ; these two possibilities correspond to the two pairs of branches drawn under the vertex @xmath25 ( and note the there are two vertices of this kind , corresponding to the previous , two different choices ) .",
    "so , the recipe is clear : it prescribes to draw two branches under each vertex ( corresponding to 0 and 1 ) to link it to the following , until the last choice .    proceeding in this way",
    ", we have explicitly listed all the possibilities , by assigning @xmath0 or @xmath21 to each adjacency matrix element and producing @xmath27 binary , undirected matrices .",
    "note that the empty graph , @xmath28 , is produced by a series of @xmath29 zeros ( on the left side of the tree ) and that the complete graph , @xmath30 , is produced by a series of @xmath29 ones ( on the right side of the tree ) .",
    "a worked example of this tree - generation is provived in fig .",
    "[ grand ] .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the binary , directed networks . in this case , the tree would have @xmath31 leaves because also the `` reciprocal '' pairs should be considered and drawn , accordingly ( so , each pair @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , would be linked to the reciprocal , @xmath10 with @xmath32 , and not directly to @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ) .     vertices .",
    "the leaves are the binary , undirected networks constituting the corresponding grandcanonical ensemble , whose cardinality is @xmath35",
    "a binary graph is usually defined as a couple of sets , @xmath5 and @xmath36 where @xmath5 is the set of vertices and @xmath36 is the set of edges : when considering binary , undirected networks @xmath37 ^ 2 $ ] ( the latter being the subset of the power set of @xmath5 , whose elements have cardinality two ) ; when considering binary , directed networks @xmath38 ( the latter being the cartesian product of @xmath5 with itself ) .",
    "these definitions can be unified , considering the definition of _ relation _ @xcite .    given two sets , @xmath39 and @xmath7 , a relation @xmath40 is a subset of the cartesian product @xmath41 .",
    "let us come back to the explicit generation of the grandcanonical ensemble .",
    "we could also ask , at every step : _ are @xmath12 and @xmath13 in relation ? _ by repeating this question at every step of the previous tree , and by answering `` yes '' ( 1 - and drawing a link between the corresponding vertices ) or `` not '' ( 0 - and not drawing a link between the corresponding vertices ) , a graphical representation of the considered relation is obtained .",
    "in fact , let us consider the cartesian product @xmath42 and think about the link set , @xmath36 : links are nothing but the pairs @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "so , @xmath20 indicates that the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not linked and the pair @xmath46 does not belong to @xmath36 : @xmath47 ; on the other side , @xmath19 indicates that the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are linked and the pair @xmath46 belongs to @xmath36 : @xmath48 . in summary ,    @xmath49    ( where the line over the letter @xmath40 indicates that the two elements are not related ) showing that _ binary graphs are graphical representations of relations",
    "so , given @xmath3 vertices , the total number of binary relations ( binary networks ) definable over them is @xmath50 .",
    "even if the correspondence between graphs and relations is well - known , complex network theory can provide the tools to `` quantify '' the considered relation .",
    "a relation is said to be reflexive when @xmath51 .    to verify",
    "if a given relation is reflexive @xcite , we have to verify if every vertex is in relation with itself .",
    "this is easily done by considering the trace of the adjacency matrix @xmath17 : @xmath52 .",
    "we have three cases : all the vertices are in relation with themselves , only some of them are in relation with themselves and no vertex is in relation with itself ; the trace assumes three different values , respectively :    @xmath53    it is possibile to count how many relations ( networks ) are of the three kinds , above : there are @xmath31 antireflexive relations , @xmath31 reflexive relations and the remaining @xmath54 $ ] are not - reflexive . if , as usual in network theory , the diagonal elements ( or self - loops ) are often ignored : this means that @xmath55 and only the @xmath31 antireflexive relations are considered ( exactle the cardinality of the grandcanonical ensemble of binary , directed networks ) .",
    "a relation is said to be symmetric when @xmath56 .",
    "a relation is said to be antisymmetric when @xmath57 with @xmath58 .    in other words",
    ", to verify the symmetry of a relation we have to verify if every link has its reciprocal ( i.e. another link connecting the same two vertices but pointing in the opposite direction ) @xcite .",
    "as for the reflexivity , a quantity exists to measure the degree of ( a)symmetry of a given relation : the reciprocity @xcite ,    @xmath59    ( where every index runs from 1 to @xmath3 ) according to which    @xmath60    note that an empty network has all the adjacency matrix entries equal to zero .",
    "this implies that @xmath61 , that is @xmath62 is an indeterminate form . in this case , the network is trivially both symmetric and antisymmetryc and the indeterminate form can be solved both as 0 or 1 .",
    "even if the relations considered in complex network theory are antireflexive , the definition of reciprocity explicitly excludes them frome the sums : this makes @xmath62 a valid index to measure the reciprocity of a generic relation ( even in presence of its diagonal elements ) because the diagonal of a relation has not influence on its symmetry @xcite .",
    "now , it becomes clear why binary , undirected networks are particular cases of binary , directed networks : they represent symmetric relations where all links have their own reciprocal : @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "it is possibile to count how many relations ( networks ) are of the three kinds , above : there are @xmath65 symmetric relations , @xmath66 antisymmetric relations ( note that the @xmath3 diagonal elements are counted in both ) and the remaining are asymmetric .",
    "so , the grandcanonical ensemble of binary , undirected networks ( being a subset of the set of relations definable on @xmath3 vertices ) is obtainable by simply requiring that the networks ( relations ) are undirected and without self - loops ( that is , symmetric and antireflexive ) , restricting the number of graphs to be @xmath67 . on the other side ,",
    "the grandcanonical ensemble of binary , directed networks is obtainable by simply requiring that the network ( relations ) are directed and without self - loops ( that is , antireflexive ) , restricting the number of graphs to be @xmath31 .",
    "a relation is said to be transitive when @xmath68 .",
    "it is evident that the following , particular cases are included in the definition of transitivity @xcite :    @xmath69 @xmath70    implying that pairs of nodes mutually interacting should also interact with themselves , by means of a pair of self - loops .",
    "however if , as usual in network theory , antireflexive relations were considered , no vertex would interact with itself thus making a symmetric relation automatically not - transitive . to avoid this , we can restrict the definition of trasitivity to the triples of distinct vertices : @xmath71 with @xmath72 . in this case",
    "a quantity can be defined to measure the degree of transitivity of the considered relation @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ clustdir ] :    @xmath73    ( where the indexes run from 1 to @xmath3 ) . the symbols above refer to standard quantities in network theory : the _ out - degree _ of node @xmath12 , @xmath74 , that is the number of outgoing links from @xmath12 ; the _ in - degree _ of node @xmath12 , @xmath75 , that is the number of incoming links to @xmath12 ; the _ reciprocal degree _ of node @xmath12 , @xmath76 , that is the number of links outgoing from @xmath12 and having a reciprocal partner . in the case of a symmetryc relation , @xmath64 and @xmath77 , the last symbol defining the _ degree of a node _ , that is the number of its neighbors ; so , in this case ,    @xmath78    and we recover the usual definition of the _ undirected clustering coefficient _ @xcite .",
    "the grey vertex , @xmath12 , is assumed as the point of view from which the measures are taken . ]    to understand how it works , let us consider a symmetric relation ( that is , a binary , undirected network ) .",
    "the degree of a node is the number of its neighbors : so , @xmath79 is the maximum number of @xmath12 s neighbors pairs that could be connected or , equivalently , the maximum number of triangles having @xmath12 as a vertex . now , an undirected triangle is a graphical representation of a transitive relation : since the clustering coefficient counts the fraction of triangles effectively completed , it is also a measure of the fraction of transitive relations effectively realized .    for binary ,",
    "directed networks the only difference lies in what follows : because of the directionality of the links , the order of the considered vertices is not irrelevant .",
    "@xmath80 counts the number of transitive relations by taking the point of view of the central ( `` middle '' ) vertex of the triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ trans ] and table [ tabtrans ] for a visual example ) . as with the trace and the reciprocity",
    "we have three cases :    @xmath81    if the denominator is zero for some vertex , there are no relations to realize . in the binary ,",
    "undirected case , this amounts to consider isolated nodes . in the directed case , the evenience of having a vanishing denominator is more subtle ( see fig .",
    "[ trans ] ) . in both these cases",
    ", we would have the indeterminate form @xmath82 , for some @xmath12 .",
    "as for the reciprocity , these can be solved both as 0 and 1 .     shows the effectiveness of the index @xmath80 in measuring the transitivity of the considered relation .",
    "vertex 1 completes only one of the two potential transitive relations of which it is a vertex : the triangle 214 . the triangle 213",
    "is not completed .",

    "the grandcanonical ensemble @xmath87 of binary networks ( undirected or directed ) , equipped with the operations od intersection , union and complement of a graph , is a boolean algebra .",
    "it is easy to verify that the intersection of graphs is an _",
    "internal _ operation , that is @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , being the results of the intersection between corresponding pairs of nodes only @xmath0 or @xmath21 , it represents a binary element whose contribution to the resulting graph is automatically accounted for in the tree generation .",
    "the same is valid for the union of graphs : @xmath89 .",
    "the complement of a graph is an _ internal _ operation , too : @xmath90 .",
    "this is even more evident than for the precedent operations : it is sufficient to consider that , at every step of the tree generation , a choice between @xmath0 and its complement , @xmath21 , has to be made .",
    "so , the complement of every choice is accounted for by this process .",
    "the neutral element for the intersection is the complete graph with @xmath3 vertices , @xmath91 : in facts , @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , all the adjacency matrix elements of @xmath93 are 1 , so @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the neutral element of the union is the empty graph with @xmath3 vertices , @xmath96 : @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , all the adjacency matrix elements of @xmath98 are 0 , so @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that    @xmath101    because these operations reduce to operate between pairs of nodes and it is evident that @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these operations have also the other requested properties .",
    "when computed on a single pair of variables , the intersection and the union are commutative , associative , mutually distributive @xcite .",
    "when dealing with graphs , all the pairs have to be considered independently from each other .",
    "so these propeties are preserved also for graphs : the intersection and the union are commutative    @xmath106    associative    @xmath107 @xmath108    and mutually distributive    @xmath109 @xmath110    so , by enriching @xmath111 with these three operations we have a _",
    "boolean algebra of binary , undirected ( or directed ) graphs _ , having @xmath3 vertices each :    @xmath112    we have made no distinction between undirected and directed graphs during the proofs because they can be treated in exactly the same way .",
    "so we can end up with a boolean algebra of binary undirected or directed graphs , depending on the type of network chosen .",
    "from the operations defined above , we can consider every generic graph @xmath113 in @xmath114 as a `` subset '' of @xmath93 , in the sense that @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , that is , the link set of every graph is a subset of the link set of the complete graph .",
    "in fact , by using the intersection operation    @xmath117    the grandcanonical ensemble @xmath114 is the sigma - algebra generated by the subsets of the complete graph @xmath93 ( its power - set ) : the so - called discrete sigma - algebra , whose cardinality is @xmath67 for binary , undirected networks and @xmath31 for binary , directed networks .    in the first place , @xmath118 : this is evident from the tree generation process .    in the second place , @xmath119 : in fact , every graph has its complement inside the grandcanonical ensemble .    in the third place , @xmath120 , that is : the union of a finite familiy of graphs , belonging to the grandcanonical ensemble , still belongs to it .",
    "this can be verified by taking , first , the union of two graphs ( which is an internal operation , as seen before ) and then considering a third one and so on .",
    "of course , no infinite union can be considered , because the cardinality of the grandcanonical ensemble is finite .    with a new symbol",
    ", we can indicate this sigma - algebra as    @xmath121",
    "in statistical mechanics of networks , the set of all graphs with the same number of vertices and number of links varying from zero to the maximum ( the support of the grandcanonical distribution , known , in physics , as the _ grandanocanical ensemble _ ) is used as a tool to carry on the calculations of the partition functions . however",
    ", little attention has been paid to its mathematical structure . in this paper , an answer from a logic - algebraic point of view has been provided .",
    "even if the extension of the logical operations as the union , the intersection and the complement between boolean variables to binary graphs was already known , very little attention has been paid to the role of these operations in characterizing algebraic structures of binary graphs .    by enriching the grandcanonical ensemble with the three operations of _ intersection _ , _ union _ and",
    "_ complement of graphs _ , we have found the structure of a _",
    "boolean algebra _ , that is a set of elements closed under the aforementioned operations and including the neutral elements of the intersection and the union .",
    "moreover , by considering the graphs belonging to the grandcanonical ensemble as subsets of the complete graph @xmath93 ( which is true for the corresponding link sets ) and extending the operation of union also to finite sets of graphs , the grandcanonical ensemble becomes also a _ sigma - algebra _ : in particular , the so - called _ discrete sigma - algebra _ , generated by the power - set of @xmath93 .",
    "a natural extension of this analysis concerns the weighted networks , on the one side , and the characterization of the microcanonical ensemble , on the other .",
    "one of the major challenges about the weighted networks is to find the right generalization of the binary , logic operations to the weighted grandcanonical ensemble ; the microcanonical ensemble , instead , forces us to face the need of defining a novel algebraic structure to take into account the hard , topological constraints that are usually imposed over it ( as the degree sequence , for example ) ."
