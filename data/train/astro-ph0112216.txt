    "the x - ray emission from the supernova remnant msh14 - 6_3 _  ( rcw 86 , g315.2 - 2.3 ) is characterized by spatially distinct soft and hard x - ray components ( vink , kaastra , & bleeker 1997 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission has a thermal nature , but the hard x - ray emission shows relatively little line emission , suggesting x - ray synchrotron radiation ( borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) , similar to sn 1006 ( koyama et al . 1995 ) .",
    "borkowski et al .",
    "argue that additional evidence for x - ray synchrotron radiation is the spatial correlation between hard x - ray and radio emission .",
    "a problem is , however , that the hard x - ray emission is accompanied by fe k line emission at 6.4  kev ( vink et al .",
    "the energy of the line emission indicates that the emission is from underionized iron ( fe xvii or lower ) , but it also proofs that the line emitting plasma contains electrons with energies in excess of 7.1  kev",
    ". these electrons should give rise to bremsstrahlung emission , suggesting that at least part of the hard x - ray continuum is bremsstrahlung .",
    "we present here xmm - newton  data of msh14 - 6_3_. xmm - newton  offers a superior sensitivity and spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath1 6 ) compared to asca .",
    "this allows for a better separation of the hard and soft x - ray emitting regions .",
    "the complete set of observations covers most of the remnant , but here we only discuss data from the southeastern , central and northwestern part , which were observed in august 2000 with exposures of @xmath2  ks to @xmath3  ks .",
    "more recent observations of the southwestern part will be presented in a future article .",
    "the soft x - ray emitting regions have a relatively low ionization characterized by o vii , o viii , ne ix and fe xvii with an interesting variation in the relative importance of o vii emission .",
    "the line emission is best illustrated by the spectrum from the northern shell obtained with the reflective grating spectrometer ( rgs ) ( fig .",
    "[ spectra]a ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by o vii emission , as is also the case for regions north of the shell and the fainter soft x - ray emitting regions in the southeast .",
    "[ spectra]b shows the variation in o vii and o viii emission , as observed by the epic pn instrument ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the low ionization is likely to be the result of a low electron temperature and a small ionization timescale .",
    "unfortunately , these two plasma properties are not well constraint . for the region with the lowest ionization , a region north of the northern shell , a temperature above 0.5  kev is only possible if the ionization timescale is @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "a lower limit to the temperature can be obtained by fitting a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) model , indicating an electron temperature possibly as low as 0.09  kev . the brightest soft x - ray emitting regions in the southeast may have @xmath7= 0.17  kev ( cie ) .",
    "the observed temperature range ( 0.1 - 0.5  kev ) is lower than indicated by the asca spectra ( which was not very sensitive to o vii emission ) , but is consistent with the measured width of the h@xmath8  and h@xmath9 lines , which , under assumption of full electron - ion equilibration , imply shock velocities of 310 - 605  km / s ( ghavamian et al .",
    "if it were not for the presence of the fe k emission , the most likely mechanism for the x - ray continuum would be synchrotron radiation .",
    "the presence of fe k emission , which is confirmed by the xmm - newton  data suggests , however , that at least part of the hard x - ray emission is bremsstrahlung .",
    "the xmm - newton  data indicates an fe k equivalent width of @xmath10  kev .",
    "modeling bremsstrahlung and fe k line emission from thermal and non - thermal electron distributions using the well known lotz formula ( e.g. mewe 1999 ) , we find that for the observed equivalent width and solar abundances , a temperature of at least 3  kev or a electron power law index @xmath11 are required , the latter value is consistent with the observed power law index of @xmath12 .    emission from underionized fe suggests that other elements may be underionized as well , but are not observed in the spectra as lower z elements have a smaller probability for a radiative transition after inner shell ionization .",
    "vink et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued that non - thermal bremsstrahlung may be a more appropriate model than thermal bremsstrahlung , as the cool , thermalized , part of the non - thermal distribution delays the ionization of the plasma .",
    "moreover , the low temperatures and shock velocities from other parts of the remnant are in sharp contrast to the @xmath13  kev temperatures needed to explain the fe k emission .",
    "non - thermal distributions have been predicted for heating and acceleration of particles by collisionless shocks ( bykov & uvarov ) .",
    "there are , however , some problems with this interpretation . for instance , the lack of o vii emission from the hard x - ray emitting regions require a low temperature and additional non - equilibration ionization effects .    the statistics for the fe k emission is limited , but its spatial distribution is consistent with that of the hard x - ray continuum , suggesting the two are related .",
    "this is hard to reconcile with a synchrotron model , for which the continuum is caused by electrons with energies in excess of 10  tev , and the line emission is caused by electrons with energies lower by 9 orders of magnitude .    with the better spatial resolution and sensitivity of xmm - newton",
    "it is now also clear that , even in a qualitative sense , there is not a good correlation between hard x - ray and radio synchrotron emission , which was one of the principle arguments for synchrotron emission put forward by borkowski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , based on the poor resolution asca hard x - ray maps .",
    "[ mosaics ] shows this in particular for the southeastern region , where the hard x - ray emission bends towards the center , where there is no obvious radio counterpart .",
    "based on xmm - newton  observations we have argued that the hard x - ray emission from msh14 - 6_3 _  is ( non - thermal ) bremsstrahlung rather than synchrotron emission .",
    "the mysterious x - ray emission may play a key role in studying non - thermal processes associated with collisionless shock heating and acceleration . to understand the nature of the hard x - ray emission ,",
    "detailed maps of the continuum and fe k emission are needed .",
    "a close correlation between the two would indicate a bremsstrahlung nature .",
    "a lack of correlation would indicate that the hard x - ray emission comes from two distinct components : ultrarelativistic electrons and a hot plasma .",
    "this issue can therefore be resolved by a deep xmm - newton  observation .",
