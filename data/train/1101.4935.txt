    "over the past two decades a standard model of agn has emerged . in this ` unified ' model efficient disk accretion of cold matter on the central supermassive black hole ( bh )",
    "provides the radiation field that photoionizes emission - line regions .",
    "however , there is a certain fraction of agn identified by radio observations that poses a challenge to the unified model , the so - called low - excitation radio agn ( hereafter :  leragn ) .",
    "the main difference between _ high - excitation radio agn ( heragn ) _ and these _ leragn _ is that the latter do not exhibit strong emission lines in their optical spectra ( jackson & rawlings 1997 ; evans et al .",
    "2006 ) .    recently , hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have suggested that high- and low - excitation radio agn may represent a principal separator between populations fundamentally different in their black hole accretion mechanisms ( see also evans et al . 2006 ; allen et al .",
    "2006 ; kewley et al .",
    "they developed a model in which central supermassive black holes of heragn accrete in a standard ( radiatively efficient ) way from the cold phase of the intragalactic medium ( igm ) , while those of leragn are powered in a radiatively inefficient manner by bondi accretion of the hot igm .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that low- and high excitation radio agn exhibit not only systemic differences in their black hole masses and accretion rate properties , but also in their host galaxy properties , such as stellar masses and stellar populations .",
    "this is consistent with these two classes of radio agn dividing in a stellar mass vs.  color plane in such a way that leragn occupy the red sequence and heragn inhabit the so called `` green valley '' , a sparsely populated region between the blue - cloud and the red - sequence ( 2009 ) .",
    "the stellar mass vs.  color plane can be interpreted as a time - sequence for galaxy evolution .",
    "galaxies are thought to evolve from an initial star - formation - dominated state with blue optical colors into the most massive `` red - and - dead '' galaxies through a transition phase reflected in the green valley ( bell et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b ; borch et al . 2006 ; faber et al .",
    "2007 ; brown et al . 2007 ) . in recent years",
    "it has been suggested that radio outflows from agn likely play a crucial role in this massive galaxy build - up @xcite . in this context the radio - agn feedback ( often called the `` radio '' or `` maintenance '' mode ) , which is thought to limit stellar mass growth in already massive galaxies , is expected to occur only in leragn (  2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the cosmic evolution of the space density of various types of radio agn is significantly different ( e.g.  peacock et al .",
    "1985 , willott et al .  2001 ; smolcic et al.2009 ) . based on a study of the evolution of the radio agn luminosity function out to @xmath3 ,  et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have shown that the comoving space density of low - luminosity radio agn ( predominantly leragn ) only modestly declines since @xmath3 , while that of powerful agn ( predominantly heragn ) dramatically diminishes over the same cosmic time interval .",
    "this suggests that leragn and heragn not only represent physically distinct galaxy populations , but also populations in different stages of massive galaxy build - up .",
    "if this is the case , the molecular gas masses and fractions in low- and high- excitation radio agn are expected to directly reflect this trend .",
    "we here investigate this idea by observing co(@xmath4=1@xmath50 ) emission of a carefully selected , representative sample of nearby ( @xmath1 ) he- and leragn with carma .",
    "we adopt a @xmath6cdm cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we here utilize a sample of 21 type 2 agn at @xmath1 that have been observed in x - rays ( with chandra or xmm - newton ) by @xcite .",
    "18 out of the 21 agn have been drawn from the 3crr survey , adding 3 more sources ( 3c  403 , 3c405 and cen  a ) for completeness ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the sample properties are summarized in  ( see also tab .  1 in evans et al.2006 ) .",
    "we separate our agn into leragn ( i.e.  liners ) and heragn ( i.e.  seyferts ) using standard diagnostic tools based on optical emission line flux ratios where possible ( see  and ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for this",
    "we make use of the emission line fluxes extracted from high resolution spectroscopy of 3cr sources presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also tab .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "in cases where the relevant emission line fluxes are not available , we make use of the galaxy type information available in the nasa extragalactic database to separate the sources into le- and he - ragn .",
    "the sample contains 9 heragn and 12 leragn .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath10  the given limit was computed excluding the tentative co detection in 3c  272.1 ( see ) . including the gas mass for this source yields an average of @xmath11  .",
    "compared to leragn , heragn on average have a factor of @xmath12 higher radio continuum luminosities , significantly higher accretion efficiencies , but about an order of magnitude lower mass central black holes .",
    "furthermore , their host galaxies have about a factor of 1.5 younger stellar populations and stellar masses , but about a factor of @xmath2 higher molecular gas masses .",
    "as discussed in the next section , this is consistent with the idea that high- and low- excitation radio agn form two physically distinct populations of galaxies that reflect different phases of massive galaxy formation .",
    "our main result is that heragn have systematically higher molecular gas masses ( a factor of @xmath2 ; see ) , compared to leragn .",
    "flaquer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have found a similar trend by dividing their sample ( @xmath13 radio agn observed with the iram 30 m telescope , partially overlapping with our sample ) into fr class i and ii objects .",
    "they find that the molecular gas mass in fr  iis is a factor of @xmath14 higher than that in fr  is .",
    "the fr class can be taken to roughly correspond to the low- and high- excitation classification .",
    "flaquer et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have , however , concluded that the systematic differences they find are likely a result of a malmquist bias , i.e.  simply due to a systematically higher redshift of their fr - ii sources . although our heragn lie on average at a slightly higher redshift , compared to our leragn ( 0.046 vs.  0.030 , resp . ) in the following we argue that the systematic differences we find in molecular gas mass are not due to a malmquist bias .",
    "mori et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown that the redshift distributions of carefully selected samples of radio - selected liners and seyferts are approximately the same ( see their fig .",
    "this eliminates malmquist bias from their results .",
    "they find that the detection fraction in the fir is significantly lower for liners than for seyferts ( 6.5% vs.22% , resp . ) in their sample .",
    "assuming that the star formation law parameterized by @xmath15 ( as a proxy for total gas mass ) and @xmath16 ( as a proxy for star formation rate ; e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ; solomon & vanden bout 2005 ; bigiel et al .",
    "2008 ) , on average , correctly represents the star formation properties of these samples ( as confirmed by the co / fir luminosities of the iras detected sources analyzed here ; see ) , the lower average fir luminosity in low - excitation sources ( i.e.  liner ) implies lower gas masses than in high - excitation ( i.e.  seyfert ) types of galaxies .",
    "a similar result is obtained based on average ( optically derived ) star formation rates , suggesting that those in liners are by about a factor of 3 lower than in seyferts in a redshift - matched sample .",
    "these findings suggest that the systematic differences in molecular gas mass in high- and low - excitation radio agn are physical , and not due to malmquist bias .",
    "the systematically higher molecular gas masses that we find in heragn , relative to leragn in our @xmath1 radio agn sample , are in excellent agreement with the systematic differences in various properties of high- and low- excitation radio agn , both on pc- and kpc- galaxy scales ( see  and ) .",
    "we find that , on average , heragn have lower stellar masses and stellar ages compared to leragn ( see ; see also 2009 ) .",
    "this is consistent with heragn and leragn being green valley and red sequence sources , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we show that heragn have on average higher radio luminosities than leragn , consistent with the results presented in kauffmann et al.(2008 ) .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "have shown that the fraction of radio agn with strong emission lines in their spectra significantly rises beyond @xmath17  .",
    "in general , the comparison of the black hole and host galaxy properties inferred for our 21 @xmath1 agn with much larger samples of radio agn ( kauffmann et al .  2008 ;  2009 ) suggests that our agn sample is representative of high- and low - excitation radio agn in the nearby universe .    from the average stellar masses that we infer for our high- and low excitation sources",
    "we extrapolate that they occupy @xmath18  and @xmath19  halos , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to the systematic molecular gas mass difference , this yields an even more dramatic discrepancy of more than 2 orders of magnitude in the average molecular gas fractions in he- ( @xmath20 ) and le - ragn ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the discrepancy remains significant ( about an order of magnitude ) if the average gas - to - stellar mass fraction ( which can be interpreted as star formation efficiency ) is considered .    on small scales ,",
    "the average black hole accretion efficiencies in he- and le - ragn suggest different supermassive black - hole accretion mechanisms ( standard disk accretion of cold gas in heragn vs.  bondi accretion of hot gas in leragn ; see evans et al .",
    "2006 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "furthermore , the higher black hole masses in leragn suggest a later evolution stage of their host galaxies , compared to that of heragn . this is further strengthened by the higher stellar masses in leragn , as well as older stellar ages , and less massive gas reservoirs . in the blue - to - red galaxy formation picture , blue gas rich galaxies",
    "are thought to transform into read - and - dead gas - poor galaxies , the stellar populations in the host galaxies of heragn are expected to be younger and have lower masses , while their molecular gas reservoirs  fueling further stellar mass growth  are expected to be higher than those in leragn .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the results presented here .",
    "thus , in summary , our results strengthen the idea that low- and high - excitation radio agn form two physically distinct galaxy populations that reflect different stages of massive galaxy formation .",
