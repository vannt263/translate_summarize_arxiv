    "about twenty events of supernova neutrinos were detected from sn1987a @xcite .",
    "some neutrino features such as neutrino temperatures and the energy carried out by neutrinos that had been obtained from the data of sn1987a were consistent with theoretical expectation @xcite . however , the detected number of the neutrino events was still too small to find out more details about other flavors of the supernova neutrinos and the explosion mechanism .",
    "although , we have not yet obtained neutrino events from the second core - collapse supernova which is the rare event of the century , detection of next supernova neutrinos is highly desirable to obtain important information on the neutrinos and the explosion mechanism .",
    "the expected information from the supernova neutrino observations is classified into two categories of implication for neutrino physics and for supernova physics .",
    "large - volume underground detectors are now operating to detect various neutrino events .",
    "for example , super - kamiokande ( sk ) , which is at the kamioka mine in japan , is a water cherenkov detector , filled with 50,000 ton pure water ( 32,000 ton fiducial volume for the burst mode and 22,500 ton for the other modes ) @xcite .",
    "kamland is a liquid scintillator detector with 1,000 ton active volume @xcite .",
    "sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has operated as a heavy water cherenkov detector , filled with 1,000 ton fiducial volume @xcite .",
    "now , a new generation experiment , sno+ , is planned to be constructed @xcite .",
    "we achieved remarkable development of the neutrino physics , especially about neutrino oscillation from the solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino experiments with these detectors .",
    "in addition , the supernova neutrinos are thought to be fascinating targets of these detectors .",
    "if one supernova explodes at the galactic center , thousands of neutrino events will be observed in super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "furthermore , megaton - size neutrino detectors will detect @xmath12 supernova neutrino events in the future @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos are released directly from the core , in which the extreme physical condition of very high density is realized .",
    "therefore , the supernova neutrinos would become the probe of such an environment .",
    "neutrino flavor change by the neutrino oscillations relates to neutrino oscillation parameters , i.e. , the mixing angles , mass hierarchy , and cp violation phase . most of neutrino oscillation parameters have been determined by the various neutrino experiments @xcite",
    ". however , the mixing angle @xmath0 is not precisely constrained , and only the upper bound is known from reactor experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , the sign of @xmath13 , and the cp violation phase remain unknown . however , among many studies about implication on these unknown neutrino parameters from future supernova neutrinos @xcite , there are several proposed possibilities that the detection of the neutrinos from the next galactic supernova would constrain the neutrino oscillation parameters and identify the mass hierarchy more precisely @xcite .    most of the supernova neutrinos are released for about 10 seconds after the core bounce , and interact with electrons when the neutrinos propagate through stellar matter .",
    "therefore , mikheyev - smirnov - wolfstein ( msw ) effect is to be taken into account in the neutrino oscillations of the supernova neutrinos .",
    "the msw effect on the supernova neutrino signal has been investigated previously in literatures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the initial progenitor mass dependence of the early neutrino burst taking account of the msw effect was studied in @xcite , and the earth matter effects of the supernova neutrinos were identified in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "neutrino spin - flavor conversion in supernova has been studied considering numerically in @xcite and analytically in @xcite .",
    "recently , the effect of the shock wave on msw effect of neutrino oscillations in supernova was studied @xcite .",
    "this effect appears as a decrease of the average energy of @xmath2 in the case of normal mass hierarchy ( or @xmath1 in the case of inverted mass hierarchy ) @xcite .",
    "since the shock wave passes through h - resonance region , whose typical resonance density is @xmath14 @xmath15 g/@xmath16 in a few seconds after core bounce , the adiabaticity of the resonance changes .",
    "the time dependence of the neutrino events monitors the density profile of the supernova @xcite .",
    "therefore , using msw effects embedded in the supernova neutrinos , we are able to find the density profile of the supernova .",
    "however , in many previous studies the influences of the shock wave on the neutrino events were discussed schematically using simplified and parameterized shock - wave profiles @xcite .",
    "there are many supernova simulations taking account of various explosion mechanisms . however , there are a few studies in which the neutrino oscillations were calculated by using simulation results because almost all supernova simulations were performed in only core region although msw effect occurs at outer envelope of the star . in practice",
    ", it is still very hard to carry out multidimensional simulation with neutrino transport to proceed to the shock propagation from the core throughout the envelope .",
    "therefore , it is important for the studies of the neutrino oscillations to calculate the shock propagation throughout a supernova not only in the core but also in the envelope .    in this paper",
    ", we study how the shock wave propagation and the neutrino oscillation parameters affect the supernova neutrinos .",
    "we calculate neutrino oscillations of the supernova neutrinos by using supernova simulation result in adiabatic explosion model . in our model , we calculate all processes of core collapse , bounce , and shock propagation continuously in a unified manner . in order to clarify detailed dependence of the result on the neutrino oscillation parameters and the shock wave , we calculate survival probabilities , energy spectra , and the event rates of three flavors of supernova neutrinos to be detected with sk and sno .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2 ] , we introduce our numerical method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : level3 ] , we show time evolution of the survival probability and energy spectra of the supernova neutrinos . we also study the event rates .",
    "we analyze the dependence of these neutrino signals on neutrino oscillation parameters and the shock effect .",
    "we discuss the ratio of high- to low - energy neutrino events which will be detected by sk and sno .",
    "we discuss the difference of the expected supernova neutrinos using both parameterized density and the density obtained by the simulations of supernova explosion in sec .",
    "[ sec : level4 ] .",
    "we also discuss other effects of supernova explosions and supernova neutrinos which should affect the time evolution of the neutrino signal .",
    "finally , we conclude our paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : level5 ] .",
    "in order to obtain the detailed density profile in a supernova explosion and to examine the msw effect on supernova neutrinos , we use one dimensional simulation result of the supernova .",
    "we model the supernova explosion using an implicit lagrangian code for general relativistic spherical hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the numerical tables of shen s relativistic equation of state ( eos ) @xcite and timmes s eos @xcite are adopted for the high and low density matters in this code , respectively .",
    "we adopt the presupernova model of a 15@xmath17 star provided by woosley and weaver ( ww95 ) @xcite as the initial condition .",
    "we use the distribution of the electron fraction @xmath18 in ww95 .",
    "we perform calculations of all processes throughout the core collapse , bounce , and shock propagation continuously by adiabatic collapse with fixed electron fraction to follow the shock wave for a long time scale ( @xmath19 s ) and a wide density range , consistently @xcite .",
    "we thus succeeded in the calculation of the propagation of the shock , which is generated by the collapse of the iron core , until the shock wave reaches the hydrogen rich envelope . throughout one calculation",
    ", one finds that the density of the central core reaches @xmath20 @xmath21 and the shock wave propagation for beyond the hydrogen envelope ( @xmath22 @xmath21 ) is solved simultaneously @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ele - density ] shows the calculated density profiles as a function of radius for every 1 s from 0 to 7 s after the core bounce .",
    "the shock wave reaches the oxygen - rich layer in 1 s and passes through the helium layer in 10 s. the horizontal lines show the density at the h - resonance of the neutrino energy .",
    "the shock wave reaches the h - resonance in about 2 s. the density behind the shock wave hardly decreases because we neglected neutrino cooling of the proto - neutron star in the present study .",
    "therefore , the shock velocity is kept almost constant at @xmath23 cm / s in this model . when the neutrino cooling of the proto - neutron star is taken into consideration ,",
    "the density and the pressure behind the shock would inevitably decrease . as a result , the shock wave would be decelerated .",
    "we study detailed analysis of the cooling effect of the proto - neutron star elsewhere .",
    "we assume the neutrino energy spectra with fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "numerical simulations of supernova explosions which include neutrino transport suggested that the resultant neutrino spectra at low - to - intermediate energies do not exactly follow fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "however , since we are interested in the event number of neutrinos to be detected in a water cherenkov detector , the neutrino signals are sensitive to high energy neutrinos because the neutrino - induced reaction cross sections in the detector are proportional to the neutrino energy . as large",
    "as the neutrino energies above @xmath24 mev are concerned , therefore , fermi - dirac distributions with finite chemical potentials may be justified as one of the reasonable approximations to the results of numerical simulations of the neutrino transport ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "although several simulations suggest different neutrino temperatures from one another , they all satisfy a common hierarchy @xmath25 .",
    "the interactions between @xmath2 and neutrons freeze out at lower temperature and density than the interactions between @xmath1 and protons do inside the neutralized supernova core , while the interactions between @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) and nucleons freeze out at much higher temperature and density because @xmath31 interact with matter only through the neutral current . in the present study ,",
    "the neutrino temperatures are set to be @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 mev , and @xmath34 mev associated with the neutrino chemical potentials @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 mev , and @xmath37 mev .",
    "these parameter values are well approximated to the time integrated spectra of the neutrinos obtained from a supernova simulation in livermore group @xcite .",
    "previous studies of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos in galactic chemical evolution of @xmath38b and @xmath39b @xcite and the r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite indicated that the neutrino temperatures are constrained by the theoretical fit to the observed elemental abundances of these nuclei : @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 mev , and @xmath42 mev , still satisfying hierarchy condition @xmath43 , where the uncertainty due to finite chemical potentials @xcite are taken into account in the inferred temperature values .",
    "our adopted values @xmath44 mev , @xmath45 mev , and @xmath46 mev are in reasonable agreement with these constraints .",
    "the energy spectrum of each flavor of neutrinos is presumed to be independent of time . the total neutrino energy carried by neutrinos",
    "is set equal to @xmath47 erg and the energy is equipartitioned to three - flavors of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "we assume the exponential decay of the neutrino luminosity with a decay time of 3 s.      in order to calculate neutrino oscillation effect on the neutrino spectrum , we solve the time evolution of the neutrino wave function along the density profile of our supernova model .",
    "the time evolution of the neutrino wave function is solved using the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy difference between two mass eigenstates , mass squared differences , the fermi constant , the neutrino energy , and the electron number density . in case of anti - neutrinos , the sign of @xmath54 changes .",
    "@xmath55 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - masukawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) @xcite .",
    "we here put the cp violating phase @xmath60 equal to zero in the ckm matrix .",
    "the neutrino oscillation parameters are taken from the analysis of various neutrino experiments @xcite , except for @xmath61 @xcite , as @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and inverted ( @xmath64 ) mass hierarchies for four cases of @xmath65 value : @xmath66 , @xmath4 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the energy spectra of the neutrinos passed through the exploding supernova , @xmath69 , are obtained from the spectra of the neutrino emitted from the neutrino sphere , @xmath70 , multiplied by the survival probability in accordance with the following equation ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 , and _",
    "@xmath73 are survival probabilities of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "neutrinos change largely their flavors at resonances of neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are two resonances for supernova neutrinos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance points of higher and lower electron number densities correspond to h - resonance and l - resonance , respectively .",
    "the electron number density at the resonance point is written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath11 at h - resonance and to @xmath78 and @xmath79 at l - resonance , respectively .",
    "the flavor change at a resonance strongly depends on adiabaticity of the resonance . when the resonance is adiabatic , large flavor change occurs .",
    "the neutrino adiabaticity is estimated by @xmath80 , @xmath81 if @xmath80 is larger than 1 , the resonance becomes adiabatic , but if it is small , resonance becomes non - adiabatic .",
    "the change of adiabaticity mainly occurs at h - resonance owing to the shock propagation .",
    "when the shock wave reaches the h - resonance , the density gradient becomes large and the value of @xmath82 decreases .",
    "this leads to a change of survival probability of neutrinos .",
    "since the resonance point is inversely proportional to the neutrino energy , this effect appears from low - energy side and moves toward high - energy side according to the shock wave propagation .",
    "as shock wave propagates outward , the density at the shock front decreases and the resonance condition is satisfied for higher energy neutrinos .      the expected event number of the neutrinos in a water cherenkov detector can be expressed as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the detection number of neutrinos , @xmath85 is the energy of electron or positron , @xmath52 is the energy of neutrino , @xmath86 is the target number , @xmath87 is the efficiency of the detector , @xmath88 is the distance from the supernova , @xmath89 is the neutrino spectrum , and @xmath90 is the cross section as a function of the neutrino energy @xcite .",

    "the cross sections of these reactions are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the cross sections become larger as the neutrino energy increases .",
    "although the sno experiment has already ended , we also evaluate the neutrino events by sno because the detection efficiency of @xmath2 is high and similar in next generation detector like sno .",

    "in the case of @xmath111 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are about 0.2 and 0.4 in @xmath112 s , respectively .",

    "if @xmath65 is large and there is not the shock wave at the resonance region , @xmath82 is larger than 1 , and the resonance is adiabatic . as a result , the survival probabilities are 0 .",
    "when the shock wave reaches a resonance , large density gradient reduces @xmath80 and the resonance becomes non - adiabatic .",
    "thus , the survival probabilities become finite during the shock passage in the resonance region . in contrast , if @xmath113 is very small , @xmath82 is smaller than 1 , and the resonance is non - adiabatic .",
    "consequently , the survival probabilities are finite , and the influence of the shock wave hardly appears to the survival probability , since h - resonance totally in non - adiabatic regardless the existence of the shock wave . in the case of @xmath114 , however , the influence of the shock wave is not clearly seen though the @xmath115 is large .",

    "the average energies of the three flavor neutrinos just emitted from the proto - neutron star satisfy the following relation ; @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , the average energy of @xmath1 in adiabatic case becomes higher than that in non - adiabatic case . as the main reaction cross section for @xmath1",
    "is proportional to @xmath159 as discussed in section [ sec : level2c ] , the detection probability of high - energy neutrinos is larger than that of low - energy neutrinos . therefore , the event rate of @xmath1 for large @xmath0 ( adiabatic case ) becomes much larger than that for small @xmath0 ( non - adiabatic case ) .",
    "this is the reason for large split between the expected event rates for large @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath129 and @xmath4 ) and small @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath160 and @xmath68 ) .",
    "we find difference of event rates by @xmath161 at @xmath125 between the two cases .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the event rates for @xmath1 which exhibits the shock wave propagation effect changes dramatically when @xmath116 is large ( right lower panel of figure [ fig : eventrate - eb ] ) . the ratio of @xmath1 increases at around 2 s , and decreases after 3 s , which is similar to @xmath2 event rates in normal hierarchy ( left lower panel of figure [ fig : eventrate - e ] ) .",
    "the mechanism is quite similar to each other so that the shock wave propagation through the h - resonance starts from low energy neutrinos to high energy neutrinos , which eventually decreases the event rates .",
    "however , the decrease in the ratio of the @xmath1 event rates is remarkable by at most 30 % for @xmath162 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio changes weakly for the other @xmath0 values because h - resonance is non - adiabatic regardless of the shock wave , although its degree is still larger than the @xmath2 event rate ( see left lower panel of figure [ fig : eventrate - e ] ) .",
    "the event rate of @xmath1 is extremely larger than that of @xmath2 ( for a given neutrino oscillation parameter set ) .",
    "this is mainly because the total cross section of @xmath1-induced reactions is about @xmath163 times larger than that of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the total cross section of @xmath1-induced reactions is almost proportional to the square of neutrino energy , but the total cross section of @xmath2-induced reactions is linearly proportional to the neutrino energy . owing to this different energy dependence of the cross sections , one can expect that the effect of the shock wave should be identified more clearly in the @xmath1 events . in practice , since the shock effect is folded in the observed event rates of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we should carry out careful theoretical analysis .",
    "the observed event rates are statistically uncertain of the order of their square root . as for @xmath2 in normal hierarchy",
    ", the statistical error is the same order as the change in the ratio @xmath164 of the event rates with and without the shock effect because absolute number of expected event rates are small @xmath165 ( figure [ fig : eventrate - e ] ) : actually , @xmath166 at @xmath167 s when the shock effect becomes maximum strength , and thereby @xmath168 . on the other hand , for @xmath1 in inverted hierarchy",
    ", the statistical error is expected to be small enough because of large absolute number of expected event rates @xmath169 ( figure [ fig : eventrate - eb ] ) : in this case , since @xmath170 at @xmath167 s , @xmath171 which is much smaller than the maximal change in the ratio @xmath172 of the event rates .",
    "there is a potential difficulty in identifying the influence of the shock wave upon the observed neutrino events because time evolution of the original neutrino spectra , which is unaffected by the shock wave as well as the msw effect , is unknown .",
    "the original neutrino spectra must be assumed theoretically a priori .",
    "we therefore look for another useful observable that should show a clear signature of the shock wave effect even when we do not know the time evolution of the original neutrino spectra .",
    "we consider now the ratio of the high - energy component to the low - energy component of time - integrated neutrino events .",
    "this ratio @xmath173 is defined by @xcite , @xmath174 where x refers to sk or sno and @xmath175mev ( sk ) and 5 mev ( sno ) as explained below eq .",

    "these characteristics in the parameter dependence of @xmath179 and @xmath180 are consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameter dependence which we confirmed in @xmath179 and @xmath180 as discussed above could be an important observational signature to discriminate neutrino mass hierarchy , normal or inverted , as well as the mixing angle , @xmath0 . in normal hierarchy , the ratios @xmath179 and @xmath180 are small regardless of the mixing angle @xmath0 and the shock effect .",
    "furthermore , @xmath180 changes a little according to the value of @xmath0 and @xmath179 hardly changes .",
    "we defined @xmath173 as the total events of all flavors .",
    "most of the events detected in sk is @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the variation of @xmath2 events is hindered by larger @xmath1 events unchanged by the @xmath0 variation .",
    "on the other hand , the events of sno contain the events of @xmath2 as much as that of @xmath1 , because the cross section of @xmath2-induced reaction is of the same order as that of @xmath1-induced reaction .",
    "therefore , we can see the variation of @xmath2 . however , the variation of @xmath2 is small because the number of events is not so different between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in inverted hierarchy , the ratios @xmath179 and",
    "@xmath180 correlate with the mixing angle @xmath0 and the shock effect .",
    "larger @xmath0 value indicates larger @xmath179 and @xmath180 ratios .",
    "however , the shock effect reduces @xmath179 and @xmath180 even in large @xmath0 value .",
    "therefore , we do not distinguish the value of @xmath0 and the shock effect in @xmath179 and @xmath180 .      in the previous subsection , we discussed the ratio of high - energy to low - energy events , @xmath173 , which is the ratio of the neutrino events integrated over the time .",
    "we also evaluated in sec .",
    "[ sec : eventrate ] the time - dependent event rates integrated over the neutrino energy . figures [",
    "fig : eventrate - e ] and [ fig : eventrate - eb ] indicate that some effects of shock wave propagation could be observed at later times when the shock wave reaches h - resonance .",
    "however , we apparently lose some important information on the effects of shock wave in either case . in this subsection",
    ", we explore for the signature of the shock wave effects by taking account of double differential as to both time and energy .",
    "we here define time - dependent ratio of the events of high - energy to low - energy neutrinos , @xmath182 where x refers to sk or sno .",
    "figure [ fig : timeratio ] shows this ratio @xmath183 as a function of time .",
    "the values of @xmath184 are @xmath185 , @xmath4 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 from top to bottom panels .",
    "left panels are for normal hierarchy and right panels are for inverted hierarchy .",
    "solid and dashed lines are the calculated results with and without shock wave , respectively .",
    "note that the scale of each panel is different .",
    "first , we show @xmath186 in normal hierarchy in left panels of figure [ fig : timeratio ] .",
    "the effect of shock wave is seen , but it is a very small effect of at most about 10 % .",
    "as for observed @xmath2 spectrum in normal hierarchy , 70 % is the original @xmath31 and 30 % is the original @xmath2 in the non - adiabatic case , though almost 100 % is the original @xmath31 in the adiabatic case .",
    "on the other hand , 70 % of the observed @xmath2 is the original @xmath1 and 30 % is the original @xmath31 in inverted hierarchy .",
    "moreover , the shock effect of @xmath2 in normal hierarchy is washed out by neutral current and charged current of @xmath1 because the target of neutrino detection is deuteron .",
    "therefore , the variation of the event rate ratio is small in the normal hierarchy .",
    "there is , however , possibility of finding shock wave effect if much larger events are detected by the next generation detector .",
    "second , we show @xmath187 in inverted hierarchy in right panels of figure [ fig : timeratio ] .",
    "the event rate ratio @xmath187 is constant in early times and strongly depends on @xmath116 .",
    "it is 4.7 and 1.8 in the case of @xmath162 and @xmath68 , respectively , at @xmath150 s. the value of @xmath187 is large when @xmath116 is large , because the h - resonance is adiabatic and the average energy of @xmath1 is high .",
    "the small @xmath187 value is due to non - adiabatic state of h - resonance . when the shock wave effects are included and @xmath188 is @xmath4 ( large ) , @xmath187 greatly changes with time .",
    "although @xmath187 is 4.7 until 2 s , it decreases to @xmath9 , which is closer to the ratio in the case of non - adiabatic state in 4 - 8 s. this decrease is due to the change of the adiabaticity of h - resonance according to the shock propagation .",
    "the h - resonance is adiabatic before the shock arrival to the resonance .",
    "in contrast , the h - resonance is non - adiabatic while the shock wave propagates in the resonance , and @xmath187 approaches @xmath189 which is the ratio in small @xmath115 case ( see the bottom panel ) .",
    "when @xmath190 is as small as @xmath68 , we see only small differences of @xmath187 between the cases with and without the shock wave and hardly see the time dependence .",
    "the h - resonance is non - adiabatic whenever the shock wave is on the resonance or not in this case of small @xmath113 .    to conclude",
    ", we can see a clear signature of the shock wave in the time - dependent high - energy to low - energy ratio of @xmath183 although the influence of the shock wave is less clearly seen in the ratio of time integrated event rates , @xmath173 .",
    "therefore , the observations of the time evolution of @xmath183 is quite an important observable to constrain the neutrino oscillation parameters and to find the effects of shock propagation in supernovae .",
    "fogli et al.@xcite found qualitatively similar result to ours in the calculated event rates with and without forward shock in the case of inverted hierarchy for @xmath191 .",
    "their results are however different from ours quantitatively for several reasons . for one ,",
    "their event rates at the neutrino energy 45 @xmath192 5 mev are calculated by assuming the next generation detector of 0.4 mton pure water that is 12.5 bigger than 32 kton for sk .",
    "we can scale our calculated results by 12.5 times in order to remove this apparent difference .",
    "the second reason is that they adopted completely different supernova model from ours .",
    "although it is hard to reconcile the difference between the two models , we tried to compare at least the effect of shock wave propagation in the following manner .",
    "we should , first , refer to our result of the event numbers at the same neutrino energy 45 @xmath192 5 mev at 5 s after the core bounce for @xmath193 .",
    "this aims to compare the two results of the event rates so that the shock wave effect appears most remarkably in both calculations in the case of inverted hierarchy .",
    "second , we should remove the bias based on different supernova models especially arising from different density profiles from each other . for this purpose",
    "we normalize our event number without shock to fogli s event number without shock .",
    "we thus obtain finally the following event numbers ; 135 with shock and 300 without shock in inverted hierarchy .",
    "these scaled and normalized numbers should be compared with fogli s results ; 130 with shock and 300 without shock .",
    "note again that the latter number in either calculation is the same by definition of normalization .",
    "our numerical calculations show 55.0 % decrease in the event number as a resultant net effect of shock wave propagation , which is in reasonable agreement with 56.7 % decrease as shown by their calculations .",
    "we thus conclude that their theoretical calculations and ours of the neutrino event rates agree with each other despite several essential differences : we solved in eq .",
    "( 1 ) both flavor conversion of neutrinos and supernova density profile numerically in our method described in sec . 1 , while fogli et al .",
    "@xcite applied an artificial model of density profile of shock wave propagation without solving dynamical supernova explosion . for further comparison ,",
    "let us analytically estimate the decrease in the neutrino events in the non - adiabatic case ( with shock ) compared with the adiabatic case ( without shock ) . in the non - adiabatic case , we define the survival probability of @xmath1 as @xmath194 in our model , and we use the result of @xmath1 in the case of normal hierarchy in fogli s model .",
    "we set @xmath195 in the adiabatic case .",
    "thus estimated analytical results show 62.3 % and 63.0 % decrease in the neutrino events from adiabatic to non - adiabatic cases in our model and their model , respectively .",
    "these values are close enough to each other , and @xmath196 are not very different from @xmath197 which was inferred from numerical calculations as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this fact justifies that our treatment of analytical estimates are reasonable .",
    "therefore , regardless of all possible differences between the two models , the supernova neutrinos provide a powerful tool to indicate the shock wave propagation inside supernova if @xmath116 is large in the inverted hierarchy .",
    "we assumed that cp violating phase is zero and @xmath198 throughout this study .",
    "however , cp - phase is unknown and there is an uncertainty in the mixing angle @xmath199 .",
    "here we discuss the dependence of the shock effect on neutrino flavor transitions on cp - phase and @xmath199 .",
    "transition probabilities of neutrinos in arbitrary density profile have been studied theoretically in @xcite , where it was found that the transition probabilities of @xmath200 and @xmath201 do not depend on cp - phase and mixing angle @xmath199 at all .",
    "furthermore , one can show from their formula in @xcite that the sum of the transition probabilities of @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( @xmath204 and @xmath205 ) are totally free from cp - phase and @xmath199 .",
    "since the spectra of @xmath206 and @xmath29 ( @xmath28 and @xmath30 ) are the same at the neutrino sphere , the transition probability from @xmath206 or @xmath29 ( @xmath28 or @xmath30 ) to @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) can be written as a half of the sum of the transition probabilities of @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( @xmath204 and @xmath205 ) . the transition probability from @xmath206 or @xmath29 ( @xmath28 or @xmath30 ) to @xmath2 ( @xmath1 )",
    "does not depend on cp - phase and @xmath199 .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no effect of cp - phase and mixing angle @xmath199 on the supernova neutrino spectra .",
    "if the influence of the shock wave is seen very early ( @xmath209 ) in the observation of the supernova neutrinos , it might mean that the shock wave reaches h - resonance ( @xmath210 ) very early after core bounce . then",
    ", we would expect that this kind of supernova explosion exhibits a strong shock wave effect in the direction of observer .",
    "moreover , assume that we could know viewing angle from the axis of a supernova in optical and radio observations .",
    "if the viewing angle is small and the influence of the shock wave is seen very early , this supernova has strong shock like a narrow beaming jet along the axis of supernova explosion .",
    "therefore , we would expect that this supernova explodes in the mechanism associated with the jet formation @xcite .",
    "if the viewing angle is large and the influence of the shock is seen very early , we would expect that this supernova has a rather wide jet and may be close to the spherical symmetric explosion .    on the other hand , if the influence of the shock wave is seen in the supernova neutrinos at relatively later time , and the viewing angle is small , we would expect that this explosion is also close to the spherical symmetry without jet .",
    "therefore , we would expect that this supernova explodes in the mechanism without a jet .",
    "details of the influence of neutrino oscillation on jet explosion are discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , oxygen emission - line profiles from supernovae are observed , which could be a signature of an aspheric explosion @xcite .",
    "we would study the asphericity of the supernova explosions more in detail from such an optical observation and simultaneous detection of the supernova neutrinos .",
    "the flavor - exchange effects by the neutrino self - interactions might also be important because of their huge flux immediately after the emission out of the proto - neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this could change initial neutrino spectrum from what we assumed here .",
    "we investigated the neutrino signal to study the effect of the shock wave propagation as well as the dependence on unknown neutrino oscillation parameters of mass hierarchy and @xmath0 by carrying out numerical calculations of the neutrino event number using the simulation result of a supernova explosion .",
    "we followed adiabatic collapse of iron core , core bounce , and the shock wave propagation in the stellar envelope for a long time ( @xmath211 s ) using general relativistic hydrodynamical code and realistic density profile .",
    "then , we could calculate detailed time evolution of the event number rate and spectra of the supernova neutrinos .",
    "the expected event rate of @xmath1 in the case of the inverted mass hierarchy and that of @xmath2 in the normal mass hierarchy depend on the mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath3 is larger than @xmath212 , the influence of the shock wave appears in the observation after 2 s in our model .",
    "it is the time when the shock wave reaches the h - resonance .",
    "therefore , the shock effect and the constraint on @xmath0 can be inferred even by the event rate integrated by the whole energy range .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish the influence of the shock wave and the neutrino oscillation parameters only from the time evolution of the event rate .",
    "the time - integrated ratio of the events of high - energy to low - energy neutrinos is another indicator to examine the shock effect and constrain mass hierarchy and @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter dependence of the time integrated ratio @xmath173 ( x = sk or sno ) could be an important observational signature to discriminate neutrino mass hierarchy , normal or inverted , as well as the mixing angle , @xmath0 . both of the ratios @xmath179 and @xmath180 correlate with the value of @xmath0 in inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "therefore , the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy , might be able to be constrained by this ratio .",
    "the shock effect reduces the ratios @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this effect is not distinguished with smallness of @xmath0 .",
    "the time - dependent ratio of high- to low - energy neutrino events is more preferable indicator to find out the shock effect clearly .",
    "the ratio decreases after 2 s for @xmath186 in normal hierarchy and for @xmath187 in inverted hierarchy .",
    "the decrease is the most remarkable in the case of @xmath154 and more clearly in inverted hierarchy .",
    "the dramatic decrease in the ratio could be a clear signal for the shock wave effect and would constrain the minimum value of @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , observations of the time - dependent ratio of the high- to low - energy neutrino event are an important observable to find the effects of shock propagation in supernovae .",
