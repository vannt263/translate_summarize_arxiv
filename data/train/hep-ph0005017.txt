    "the study of the process @xmath3 and the related form factors when two virtual photons produce a neutral pion provides a simple , interesting and clean test of qcd .",
    "in contrast to the pion electromagnetic form factor it is not asymptotically supressed by being multplied by the strong coupling constant @xmath4 . in the lowest order in @xmath4 ,",
    "perturbative qcd predicts that @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the phenomenological pion distribution amplitude and @xmath7 are the fractions of the pion light cone momenta carried by the quarks in the region where both photon virtualities @xmath8 and @xmath9 are large .    the most experimentally favourable situation is when one of the photons is real , @xmath10 and this has led to the measurement of the form factor @xmath11 by the cello @xcite and clio @xcite groups .",
    "recently , radyushkin and ruskov @xcite have undertaken to obtain the transition form factor @xmath12 independently of the specific form of the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "they  have rather first evaluated the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions to the amplitude @xmath13 in the deep euclidean region and have the extrapolated to the mass - shell of one of the photons in a qcd  sum rule @xcite approach .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to undertake this extrapolation in a more straightforward and much less model dependant way .",
    "the task of extrapolating qcd  prodictions from the deep asymptotic region to low energies is not a trivial one , an effective way is the use of qcdsum rules @xcite in which use is made of the analyticity properties of an amplitude to write dispersion integrals the low energy part of which is saturated by known resonances and where qcd is employed to evaluate the asymptotic part .",
    "it is in general hard to assess the quality of the approximations made as resonance saturation should not be expected to hold over too large an interval and deviations from qcd could become important far away from the euclidean region .",
    "a simple model independant method of extrapolation is proposed in this note in which the integration kernel in the dispersion integral is modified by adding to it polynomials of low order @xmath14 .",
    "the polynomials are chosen such as to annihilate the kernel as well as its derivatives up to order @xmath14 in the region where both resonance saturation and qcd are least reliable .",
    "the method is applied to obtain the form factor @xmath15 .",
    "it is shown that extrapolation of the qcd expression of radyushkin and ruskov @xcite with the values they use for the damping parameters , which they deduce from stability considerations , as well as the values commonly used for the qcd non - perturbative vacuum condensates lead to values of @xmath12 in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "another application of the method is to the anomaly relation @xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the pion decay constant , which holds when both photons are on their mass - shell .",
    "in particular we evaluate corrections to the value of the @xmath18 coupling constant given by vector meson dominance .",
    "the effectiveness and stability of the method is finally demonstrated by calculating the charge and charge radius of the pion from the asymptotic behaviour of the pion s electromagnetic form factor obtained some time ago by ioffe and smilga @xcite and by nesterenko and radyushkin @xcite .",
    "agreement with experiment is good in all cases .",

    "the corresponding form factor is defined when both photons are off their mass - shell .",

    "there is no consensus on the value of the 4-quark condensate , in particular the vacuum saturation approximation @xmath32 is likely to be badly violated @xcite .",
    "fortunately the contribution of the non - perturbative condensates to our sum rules is quite small which renders our results insensitive to their exact values .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our purpose is to extrapolate expression ( [ 2.2 ] ) to @xmath33 and compare with the experiemtal measurment of @xmath34 done by cello @xcite and clio @xcite .    at low values of @xmath35",
