    "<S> coulomb repulsion between 4@xmath1 electrons gives rise to a gap formation on the order 10 mev at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> while such materials behave like a kondo metal at temperatures ( @xmath6 ) higher than the gap energy , they show insulating behavior at low @xmath6 . for smb@xmath2 , the collapse of the insulating gap and the emergence of a magnetic order occur at the same pressure  @xcite , which suggests that the gap formation competes with the long - range magnetic ordering .    </S>",

    "<S> the system undergoes a valence transition at a critical pressure of approximately @xmath8 0.7 gpa at @xmath9 300 k from divalence to mixed valence , accompanied by a color change from black to golden yellow  @xcite . in this mixed - valence phase ( named golden sms ) , two configurations of 4@xmath10 and 4@xmath11 are energetically degenerate : @xmath12 this is also described formally as ( @xmath13 ) sm@xmath14 sm@xmath15 with 0 @xmath161 , which leads to the definition of the mean valence as @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> magnetic susceptibility revealed that the ground state at @xmath31 is antiferromagnetic ( afm )  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the broken curve in the paramagnetic phase , which terminates at the tcp , is a crossover line signifying the opening of a pseudogap at the characteristic temperature @xmath24  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the extensive studies mentioned above , including a theoretical analysis , the origin of the pseudogap remains unknown . in this letter , we present systematic experiments on golden sms . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) all physical quantities studied here showed an anomaly at the same temperature @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in particular , the magnetic susceptibility exhibited spin - singlet state formation below @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> to explain these results , we propose a scenario of exciton formation ( i.e. , the electron @xmath22 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) being trapped at the sm@xmath15 ion ) below @xmath24 , as theoretically predicted by kikoin  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> single - crystal preparation was presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 19 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental details of transport , thermal expansion , and thermoelectric power were described elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dc magnetization was measured by a commercial squid magnetometer . </S>",
    "<S> high pressure was generated using a piston - cylinder clamped cell with daphne oil 7373 as the pressure - transmitting medium . </S>",
    "<S> applied pressure was estimated at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ low - temperature region at @xmath32  _ </S>",
    "<S> we start with the presentation of low-@xmath6 experimental results at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath33 of a sm - excess sample . @xmath33 increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a hump structure , before increasing again below 10 k. note that a similar structure was observed in all the other samples studied here with different compositions </S>",
    "<S> [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) and ( c ) ] and in the samples presented in previous reports  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these suggest that the anomaly can be intrinsic to golden sms .    </S>",
    "<S> to explore the origin of the anomalous behavior , we measured several physical quantities at almost the same pressure ( @xmath8 0.6 and 1.6 gpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-3(f ) .         0.6 and 1.6 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) thermal expansion coefficient @xmath34 , ( b ) electrical resistivity @xmath35 , ( c ) magnetic susceptibility @xmath36 , ( d ) hall coefficient @xmath37 , ( e ) relative charge mobility @xmath38 , and ( f ) seebeck coefficient @xmath39 . broken ( vertical ) lines denote @xmath24.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    \\(a ) at 0.6 gpa , thermal expansion coefficient @xmath40 shows a broad negative minimum at @xmath41 22 k. by subtracting the ambient result as a phonon contribution , we observed a schottky - like anomaly with a ( pseudo)gap @xmath42 61 k  @xcite . for the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , in which one may notice that the gap disappears suddenly in the vicinity of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) the temperature at which @xmath33 shows the hump structure almost coincides with @xmath24 probed by the thermodynamic technique mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the low-@xmath6 increase ( below @xmath24 ) in the resistivity is clearly intrinsic and of bulk origin .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) according to a previous report  @xcite , @xmath43 monotonically increases with decreasing @xmath6 , and saturates at a constant value at low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a new finding in this study is a small but clear decrease below @xmath24 described as @xmath44 ( see dotted line in the inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the spin gap is estimated as @xmath45 k at 0.6 gpa , which is almost the same as the pseudogap @xmath26 obtained above . by analogy to the local bound state in kis , we interpret the spin gap as a signature of the local bound state formation with a spin singlet .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(d ) the hall constant @xmath46 exhibits a minimum at @xmath24 ( see the inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the major carrier at low @xmath6 is a hole , in contrast to an electron in the afm ordered state  @xcite . assuming that @xmath47 for a compensated metal ( where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the hole and electron carrier densities , respectively ) </S>",
    "<S> , we have the relation @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the hole and electron mobilities , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the inequality @xmath53 because @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain the carrier number @xmath55 3 @xmath56 10@xmath57 per formula unit ( f.u . )  at 2 k. this upper value of @xmath28 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the room - temperature value , indicating that the carrier density decreases due to the pseudogap opening below @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(e ) the ratio @xmath58 yields the relative charge mobility @xmath59 . whereas @xmath60 at high @xmath6 , @xmath61 at low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that electrons become less mobile than holes at low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the mobility shows a strong @xmath6 dependence at low @xmath6 . if the impurity scattering is dominant , then the mobility is @xmath6-independent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the low-@xmath6 scattering mechanism is not dominated by impurity scattering but presumably by carrier - carrier scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is consistent with the result derived from ( d ) ; the carrier density decreases with decreasing @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(f ) the seebeck coefficient @xmath62 shows a very similar feature to @xmath40 . according to a theory of ki  @xcite , the peak of @xmath63 indicates ( pseudo)gap formation . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of @xmath62 is indeed consistent with that of @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ low - temperature region at @xmath31  _ in the afm region above @xmath0 , the major carrier is an electron in contrast to that in the pseudogap region , and its density is approximately 0.5 per f.u .  [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this value is of the same order as that expected from the high-@xmath6 @xmath19 value [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] , indicating that the carrier number is almost invariant with @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(a ) shows @xmath33 in a semi - logarithmic plot . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the resistivity to logarithmically increase with decreasing @xmath6 before decreasing at @xmath25 . at low @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) ] , @xmath33 shows a fermi liquid behavior , @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> . the @xmath65-coefficient decreases with increasing @xmath7 away from @xmath0 , consistent with a previous report  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath65-coefficient amounts to a large @xmath66 @xmath67cm / k@xmath68 at @xmath69 gpa , comparable to that of the kondo metal ceb@xmath2 in the afm ordered state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is inferred from the so - called kadowaki - woods relation that the electronic specific heat coefficient of the present system exceeds 200 mj / k@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , golden sms ( at @xmath31 ) is identified as a metallic heavy - fermion system , in which a virtual bound state forms at low @xmath6 .     at pressures identified in figure . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath70 dependence of resistivity at @xmath71 2.22 and 2.57 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> dotted lines denote the @xmath70 dependence.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     multiplied by @xmath6 at @xmath71 0.98 gpa and ( b ) inverse of @xmath72 . here , @xmath73 is the @xmath6-independent term of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> dotted lines indicate @xmath43 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) in the text.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    _ high - temperature region  </S>",
    "<S> _ there is no phase transition at high @xmath6 over the entire @xmath7 region investigated here , as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider @xmath43 again . </S>",
    "<S> figure  5(a ) shows the @xmath6 dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in the form of @xmath74 against @xmath6 at @xmath8 0.98 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a @xmath6-linear dependence in the high-@xmath6 region . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to describe the magnetic susceptibility as @xmath75 with a @xmath6-independent term , @xmath76 emu / mole f.u . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed from the plot of the data in the form of @xmath77 against @xmath6 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the curie constant @xmath78 0.089 emu k / mole f.u . </S>",
    "<S> is comparable to the free sm@xmath15 ion value . in conjunction with </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic @xmath6-dependence of @xmath33 mentioned in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) , we suggest the presence of localized magnetic moments in the high-@xmath6 region .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us interpret the results presented above in terms of the exciton model  @xcite , assuming that exciton binding energy is given by @xmath79 ( where @xmath80 is a boltzmann constant ) . at high @xmath6 greater than @xmath24 , the bound state breaks down ; hence , the sm@xmath15 ion and the electron @xmath22 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) are decoupled and contribute to the curie and @xmath73 terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the electron @xmath22 carries an electrical current </S>",
    "<S> . then , the interplay between the sm@xmath15 ion and the electron @xmath22 can give rise to kondo scattering , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . at low @xmath6 ( less than @xmath24 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the binding energy overcomes the thermal energy , then the electron @xmath22 is trapped to form the bound state , resulting in the carrier number decrease shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the pseudogap results from exciton formation . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is compatible with the absence of a hybridization gap in calculated band structures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we attempt to estimate the exciton radius @xmath81 , assuming the well - known formula @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the binding energy and bohr radius of the hydrogen atom , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the dielectric constant @xmath85 230  @xcite , which is obtained for a scraped surface at ambient pressure , and @xmath86 k at @xmath0 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ] , we have @xmath87 nm , which should be regarded as an upper limit of @xmath81 because @xmath88 is expected to become greater with increasing @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we evaluate @xmath89 nm using the equation @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the screening length ) . here , we assumed that the exciton breaks down due to the screening effect at @xmath0 , and estimated @xmath92 by the thomas - fermi approximation @xmath93 with @xmath94 per f.u .  </S>",
    "<S> [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two values of @xmath81 may not be incompatible with each other considering the crude approximations made . </S>",
    "<S> if we accept this , then we suggest that the screening effect plays a role in the phase transition at @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> .    one may ask if excitons condense at low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> all of the physical properties studied here exhibit an anomaly at @xmath24 , but there is no indication of the phase transition there . at the present stage , </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the ground state is not a bose - einstein condensate but an exciton gas . </S>",
    "<S> it may be interesting to explore if the condensation would occur at an extremely low @xmath6 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the thermodynamic , transport , and magnetic properties of golden sms , and proposed an exciton model to interpret them . at high </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 , there are localized moments as confirmed from the curie law . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state depends on pressure . at @xmath32 , </S>",
    "<S> the localized moments disappear as a result of the spin - singlet , exciton - like bound state formation below @xmath24 . at @xmath31 , by contrast , the localized moments survive and form the afm ordering below @xmath25 owing to the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction via heavy quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the ground state changes from the real bound state to the kondo virtual bound state at @xmath0 , which may result from the competing interactions of pseudogap formation and antiferromagnetic ordering under the influence of screening . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that golden sms can be a model system in which the discontinuous qpt occurs between the valence fluctuation and kondo metal regimes . </S>"
