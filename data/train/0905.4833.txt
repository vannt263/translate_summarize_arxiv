    "the study of non - equilibrium phenomena in interacting quantum systems is one of the most challenging problems of modern condensed matter physics because several of the conceptual tools developed to describe physical systems in equilibrium ( e.g. , the partition function , mean field theory , the renormalization group ) are not readily generalized to non - equilibrium conditions . in order to make some progress in our understanding of the non - equilibrium behavior of these systems ,",
    "it is important to identify simple paradigms of non - equilibrium processes that may be studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "recently , some progress in this direction has been made through the realization of non - equilibrium experiments with cold atomic gases loaded in optical lattices@xcite that , to a good degree of accuracy , are well described by simple many - body models such as the bose - hubbard model.@xcite    the simplest non - equilibrium process among those presently under study is the _ quantum quench _ : an abrupt change in time of one of the system parameters from an initial value @xmath1 to a final one @xmath2 . in a closed system , this process corresponds to the preparation of the system in the ground state @xmath3 of an initial hamiltonian @xmath4 $ ] , which is then allowed to evolve in time according to a final hamiltonian @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this process is particularly interesting if some qualitative changes in the state of the system between @xmath1 and @xmath2 occur .",
    "this was the case in ref .  2 , where a gas of bosonic atoms was taken abruptly across a quantum critical point from the superfluid to the mott insulating region of the phase diagram .",
    "the observation of intriguing many - body collapse and revival cycles of the two phases in the momentum distribution function signaled the high degree of many - body coherence in the dynamics of these systems.@xcite    theoretically , processes assimilable to quantum quenches have already been studied a few decades ago in a series of seminal papers.@xcite more recently , however , the experiments discussed above have inspired an impressive and rapidly growing activity on this subject.@xcite apart from the concrete possibility of testing theoretical results with experiments , the main motivation behind this interest has been the shift of focus toward a broad class of fundamental issues .",
    "more specifically , a number of recent studies addressed the extension of the concept of universality to the out of equilibrium behavior of quantum critical systems subject to either quenches at or close to criticality@xcite or to linear sweeps of the control parameter across the quantum critical point.@xcite similarly , a great deal of activity is devoted to the search for dynamical manifestations of quantum integrability and to the study of the relation between non - integrability and thermalization.@xcite    looking for a simple and fundamental way to characterize quantum quenches from the point of view of non - equilibrium physics , it was recently observed that a quantum quench may be considered in the context of basic statistical mechanics as a simple thermodynamic transformation.@xcite it is thus quite natural to characterize quantum quenches using standard thermodynamic variables : the work @xmath6 done on the system,@xcite the entropy @xmath7 produced,@xcite and the heat @xmath8 generated.@xcite setting our attention on the work done , we note that since a quantum quench is not a quasistatic transformation , measurements of the work will display fluctuations among different realizations of the same process.therefore , for a complete characterization of the quench it is necessary to specify the full probability distribution of the work done @xmath9 , which has to satisfy a number of constraints , such as the jarzynski equalities and the tasaki - crooks fluctuation theorem.@xcite for quantum quenches the characteristic function @xmath10 of the distribution @xmath9 was found to be related to the loschmidt echo,@xcite @xmath11 u}e^{-ih[\\lambda ' ] u}\\ , |\\psi(\\lambda)\\rangle,\\ ] ] a quantity that emerged previously in the study of x - ray singularities in metals,@xcite dephasing,@xcite and quantum chaotic behavior.@xcite the loschmidt echo is a simple and interesting object : up to a wick rotation it can be seen as the analog of a partition function.@xcite in addition , its direct computation for a prototype quantum critical system , the quantum ising chain , revealed that for global quantum quenches of the transverse field the presence of criticality leads to singularities of the moments of @xmath9 as a function of the quench parameters , while for local quenches @xmath9 itself displays an edge singularity at low energies.@xcite    the goal of the present paper is to move one step forward toward elucidating and eventually establishing the connection between the qualitative features of the statistics of the work @xmath9 and the generic characteristics of a physical system ( e.g. , its integrability , the presence of a critical point in parameter space ) . in order to do so",
    ", it is important to obtain benchmark results for @xmath9 in exactly solvable models , understand its main qualitative features , and describe their physical origins . with this motivation",
    "we study the statistics of the work done in quantum quenches in the dicke model,@xcite an exactly solvable hamiltonian describing a gas of two level atoms interacting with a single electromagnetic cavity mode .",
    "the dicke model is an infinite dimensional quantum critical system displaying as a function of the atom - photon coupling a quantum phase transition between a normal and a superradiant phase.@xcite    focusing on quenches of the coupling constant within the normal phase , we show that criticality leaves clear signatures in the dynamics of the system and on @xmath9 : as the initial coupling tends to the critical point the average work done on the system tends to diverge , while for quenches ending at criticality the probability distribution displays an interesting sequence of edge singularities",

    "<S> we study the statistics of the work done in a zero temperature quench of the coupling constant in the dicke model describing the interaction between a gas of two level atoms and a single electromagnetic cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> when either the final or the initial coupling constants approach the critical coupling @xmath0 that separates the normal and superradiant phases of the system , the probability distribution of the work done displays singular behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the average work tends to diverge as the initial coupling parameter is brought closer to the critical value @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for quenches ending close to criticality , the distribution of work has finite moments but displays a sequence of edge singularities . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasting behavior is related to the difference between the processes of compression and expansion of a particle subject to a sudden change of its confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this by studying in detail the time dependent statistics of other observables , such as the quadratures of the photons and the total occupation of the bosonic modes . </S>"
