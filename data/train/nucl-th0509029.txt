    "in various scattering and production reactions of pions on the deuteron , the cross sections exhibit a bump at backward angles for energies around the @xmath0 production threshold . in early discussions of the underlying dynamical mechanisms",
    "the main emphasis was put on the interpretation of these anomalies in terms of dibaryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "later work , however , was mainly focused on a more natural explanation by relating this structure to the threshold effect caused by the opening of the @xmath0 production channel . in particular , in a recent experiment on coherent @xmath3 photoproduction such a bump was observed in the cross section in the backward direction around a lab photon energy @xmath4 mev  @xcite .",
    "this nontrivial energy dependence was explained in  @xcite , in which the authors conclude that the mechanism , where first an @xmath0 meson is produced on one nucleon which then interacts with the second nucleon followed by @xmath3 production , is responsible for the enhancement around the @xmath0 threshold . in particular , according to the conclusion of  @xcite , the appearance of the peak is nothing else than the signature of the @xmath5 resonance whose excitation is believed to dominate @xmath0 photoproduction @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to perform a more detailed and extensive investigation of this phenomenon .",
    "the main question we address here is the same as in  @xcite , namely what is the dynamics behind this enhancement .",
    "although it might generally be clear that the observed structure is caused by the appearance of an @xmath0 meson in one way or another , the question about the underlying mechanism seems to be non - trivial . to be more specific",
    ", we would firstly like to note three main points which will be discussed separately .",
    "\\(i ) the wide peak in the @xmath7 cross section can be a direct consequence of the cusp - like structure in the elementary amplitude @xmath8 in the @xmath9 channel near the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the case in point is the strong coupling between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states in the region of the @xmath5 resonance resulting in a very pronounced cusp in the electric dipole amplitude @xmath12 for pion photoproduction at @xmath13 710 mev .",
    "the latter was also observed in the energy independent multipole analyses ( see , e.g. , energy independent solution in ref .",
    "turning now to the process on the nucleon , which is bound in the deuteron , the elementary amplitude is expected to undergo an energy shift and a broadening of its structure due to the fermi motion . of crucial importance",
    "is the question to which extent this modification could affect the cusp in the elementary @xmath12 multipole and how prominent could be the @xmath5 resonance in the reaction on the deuteron .",
    "\\(ii ) the bump - like structure could also arise from an additional mechanism , appearing when the elementary photoproduction process is embedded into the deuteron .",
    "namely , one could expect that the anomalies are , at least partially , caused by the three - particle unitary cut in the amplitude @xmath14 starting at the energy of the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "this cut arises because of the possibility to exchange a physical @xmath0 meson between the @xmath9 resonance excited on one of the nucleons and the second nucleon .",
    "the exchange mechanism is characterized by the pole which turns into the cut after the loop integration .",
    "thus , the opening of a new physical channel leads to an additional contribution in the imaginary part of the amplitude reflecting a new inelasticity .",
    "such a picture is typical for coupled channels and , if the corresponding dynamical equations are exactly solved , results in the three - body unitary relation .",
    "because here we take into account only the leading term in the multiple scattering series , the whole amplitude does not fulfill the unitary relation .",
    "however , the @xmath2 three - body cut appears already at this level , and the question is , how does the amplitudes behave at the branch point .",
    "\\(iii ) a sizable attraction in the @xmath2 system can lead to a strong correlation between all three particles .",
    "it is worth noting that in some work the @xmath2 interaction is predicted to generate even a bound state in the quasi - deuteron configuration @xmath15 .",
    "results provided by more sophisticated models  @xcite show , however , that the fundamental @xmath16 interaction is likely to be too weak for yielding binding of the @xmath2 system , so that only a virtual ( antibound ) state can be generated . in the context of the present discussion",
    "two points are relevant : ( a ) although the pole ` recedes ' to the nonphysical region , it remains quite close to the zero energy . as a result",
    ", the virtual state can strongly influence physical processes involving an @xmath0 meson .",
    "indeed , a variety of theoretical calculations and experimental analyses exhibit a strong rise of the @xmath0 production cross section just above threshold .",
    "this collective effect , in which all three particles participate , is naturally explained within a three - body model  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the origin of the pole in the amplitude is not of crucial significance , and the existence of an @xmath2 bound state is not the necessary condition for an anomalous behavior of the @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "important is only how far is the pole from the threshold energy .",
    "( b ) perturbative models , like the first order rescattering approximation noted in ( ii ) , where only the leading order terms are kept in the multiple scattering series , are unable to reproduce the real dynamics of the @xmath2 system in the low energy region .",
    "the most simple explanation is that the corresponding neumann series converges very slowly near the pole position  @xcite , so that the leading terms turn out to be a bad approximation to the whole series . from the last considerations we conclude that any realistic study of the role of @xmath0 mesons in the reaction @xmath7 should be based on a three - body approach to the @xmath2 system .",
    "resuming now the qualitative discussion , we would like to note that all mentioned factors can come into play to form the observed characteristic bump in coherent @xmath3 photoproduction close to the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "important is the quantitative relation between the different mechanisms , which is the main object of the present paper . in the following",
    "we consider all three points separately with special emphasis with respect to their contribution to the resulting cross section . a brief description of the formal ingredients in sect .  [ form ]",
    "is followed by the discussion of our results for the differential cross section of @xmath7 in sect .",
    "an appendix contains the listing of various formulas used for the calculation of the reaction amplitude in the impulse approximation .",
    "we start the brief description of the basic formal ingredients by presenting in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the diagrams which we consider in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the three combinations ( a ) , ( a)+(b ) , and ( a)+(b)+(c ) present three different , successively improved levels of approximation to the reaction amplitude , corresponding to the three points ( i ) through ( iii ) discussed above . we will refer to them as impulse approximation ( ia ) , first order rescattering approximation , and three - body calculation , respectively .     included in the present work : ( a ) impulse approximation ; ( b ) first order rescattering contribution ; ( c ) additional contribution from three - body dynamics only in the @xmath17-wave ( @xmath18 ) ; ( d ) equation for the amplitude @xmath19 of photoproduction of the @xmath9 resonance on the deuteron.,width=529 ]    the starting point of our formalism is the impulse approximation which is completely determined by the elementary amplitude for @xmath20 and the deuteron wave function . as elementary amplitude",
    "we take the maid analysis  @xcite and for the deuteron wave function the parametrization of the bonn - potential model ( obepq - version )  @xcite with inclusion of the tensor component .",
    "the latter is certainly very important in the region of large momentum transfers .",
    "the general expression for the amplitude is given in the appendix .",
    "for the additional contributions of the diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) , we adopt the following simplifications .",
    "firstly , in the pion exchange contribution to the second diagram only the @xmath9 resonance was taken into account neglecting the contribution of other resonances .",
    "although this neglect leads to an underestimation of the pion rescattering effect it should not strongly affect the quality of our results because of the following reasons : ( i ) since rescattering of intermediate pions is not related to the threshold effects it does not contribute into formation of the peak structure which we discuss here .",
    "what we can expect is only a smooth change of the cross section at backward angles ; ( ii ) the role of pion exchange seems to be not very essential . in ref .",
    "@xcite where this mechanism was calculated more precisely the corresponding effect in the second resonance region is less than 20  % .",
    "secondly , as is indicated in fig .  [ fig1 ] , the three - body problem for the @xmath2 system was solved only for the @xmath17-wave state @xmath21 ( @xmath22 = @xmath23 ) . as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite it is the state of lowest orbital momentum which is mostly distorted by the multiple scatterings between particles . other states with higher orbital momentum can be included perturbatively within the rescattering approximation ( diagrams ( a)+(b ) ) . in order to avoid double counting",
    "we remove from the three - body amplitude those diagrams which possess the same topology as the ones already included in ( a ) and ( b ) shown in the same figure .    for the elementary amplitudes appearing in other diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we assume that the photoproduction of an @xmath0 meson as well as its interaction with nucleons proceeds exclusively via the excitation of the @xmath5 resonance . as mentioned above , the same ansatz was adopted for pions .",
    "according to this assumption the @xmath24 matrix of meson - nucleon scattering is given by the conventional isobar model @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the invariant energy and @xmath27 the various self energy contributions from the @xmath28 channels with @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath24 matrix is determined by the bare resonance mass @xmath30 and the parameters of the vertex functions @xmath31 , for which we take a simple hulthn form @xmath32 the contributions to the self energy from the various channels are expressed in terms of @xmath33 as @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "since the double pion channel @xmath36 is not explicitly included in the calculation , primarily because of its rather weak coupling to the @xmath5 , we parametrize , following  @xcite , the corresponding self energy in a simplified manner as a pure imaginary contribution proportional to the three - particle phase space @xmath37    for the photoproduction amplitude we take the same ansatz as in ( [ tmat ] ) where one hadronic vertex function is replaced by the electromagnetic vertex @xmath38 for @xmath39 which depends only on the invariant energy @xmath26 and is parametrized in the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the isospin dependence of the @xmath5 photo excitation amplitude was taken according to the relation  @xcite @xmath42    .",
    "parameters of the @xmath11 scattering matrix in eqs .",
    "( [ tmat ] ) through ( [ em1 ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath30 are in mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    the parameters , appearing in the expressions ( [ tmat ] ) through ( [ em1 ] ) , are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "they are chosen in such a way that , on the one hand , the reactions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are well reproduced in the @xmath9 channel as presented in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the chosen parameter set predicts for the @xmath11 scattering length the value @xmath47  fm which we consider as an approximate average of the various values provided by the @xmath11 analyses .    the method which we use to solve the three - body problem for the @xmath1 interaction is described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we refer the reader to this paper for the details . here",
    "we only would like to mention that the key point of the method is the separable representation of the driving two - body interaction in the @xmath48 , @xmath11 , and @xmath49 subsystems .",
    "the corresponding @xmath24 matrix for meson - nucleon multiple channel scattering is given by the isobar formula ( [ tmat ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath49 sector , we use the separable representation of the bonn potential as given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath21 and @xmath50 configurations .",
    "as is well known , the separable ansatz makes it possible to reformulate the three - body problem in terms of two - body scattering between quasiparticles . as a consequence ,",
    "the solution of the problem is given by an amplitude @xmath19 of the effective transition @xmath51 as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) . the needed physical amplitude @xmath52 is then obtained through an additional loop integration ( the first diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) .",
    "in order to demonstrate the quality of the impulse approximation , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the resulting pion angular distribution , and compare them with the available data from the compilation of  @xcite .",
    "although the agreement is quite satisfactory for the forward angles , the data are significantly underestimated in the backward region .",
    "we will return to this point at the end of the discussion . a comparison with the ia calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite also exhibits differences which are , however , not very dramatic .",
    "for instance , our cross section at @xmath53 = 700 mev shows quite a monotonic behavior and does not possess a deep minimum at very forward angles as obtained in ref .",
    "it is intuitively clear that as long as small angles are considered where the two - nucleon effects are minimal ( except for pion two - body absorption ) the magnitude of the cross section should be mostly determined by the elementary amplitude .",
    "therefore , the difference between the two theoretical results has to be ascribed primarily to the differences in the corresponding elementary operators , especially in the spin - flip part ( see eq .",
    "( [ kl ] ) ) , which accounts for the dominant fraction of the forward cross section on the deuteron .     at two photon energies .",
    "the curves are the results of the impulse approximation ( ia ) .",
    "the data are taken from the compilation in  @xcite.,width=529 ]    now we turn to our main results on the additional interaction effects as presented in fig .",
    "the curves show the predictions according to the different approximations discussed in the introduction .",
    "as one might expect , at forward angles the cross section shows very little influence of these effects . with increasing momentum transfer , corresponding to increasing pion emission angles , small internuclear distances come into play and thus corrections to the simple ia calculation from the two - nucleon mechanisms become more and more important .",
    "furthermore , a bump in the energy dependence around @xmath53 = 650 mev is clearly visible at very backward angles . among other things ,",
    "this fact can be considered as strong evidence that primarily the two - nucleon mechanisms are responsible for this phenomenon .",
    "as function of incident photon energy for two pion emission angles in the @xmath54 c.m .  system .",
    "the curves show the results of the impulse approximation ( dashed ) , first order rescattering ( dash - dotted ) and three - body calculation ( solid ) .",
    "the dotted curve shows the contribution of the @xmath0 rescattering term alone ( diagram ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) where the resonance propagators were substituted by constants ( see text ) .",
    "the corresponding values of the four - momentum transfer squared in @xmath55 are shown on the top abscissa.,width=529 ]    this obvious statement does not , however , diminish the role of the single nucleon response .",
    "as one readily sees in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , some nontrivial structure , a shoulder , appears in the cross section near the @xmath0 threshold already in the impulse approximation where the second nucleon is not actively involved .",
    "a more detailed analysis reveals , however , that the enhancement is not caused by the presence of the @xmath5 resonance .",
    "rather it is a combined effect of different terms in the maid amplitude which we use here .    on the other hand",
    ", we would like to note that the @xmath5 resonance itself does in principle produce a slight shoulder close to the @xmath0 threshold , which , as already mentioned in the introduction , is a signature of the cusp in the @xmath12 multipole smeared out by the fermi motion in the deuteron . however , this resonance contributes little to the coherent reaction on the deuteron , so that this cusp - like structure turns out to be invisible in the cross section .",
    "hence , the slight enhancement observed in the otherwise monotonic behavior of the ia cross section is not related to the @xmath2 dynamics and should be ascribed to properties of the elementary pion production amplitude in this region .",
    "now , when the first - order rescattering of the produced @xmath56 and @xmath0 mesons is included , a peak structure clearly evolves as exhibited by the dash - dotted curve in fig .",
    "as was emphasized in  @xcite , the main origin of this effect is the presence of the @xmath5 resonance in the diagram with @xmath0 rescattering .",
    "our results in general confirm this statement .",
    "it is , however , interesting that the new three - body unitary cut in the amplitude connected with the @xmath2 channel also make a slight contribution to the formation of the bump . indeed ,",
    "if the strong energy dependence of the amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath57 ( see diagram ( b ) in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) near the @xmath0 threshold is ` neutralized ' by keeping the @xmath9 propagator constant , the rescattering term alone exhibits slight enhancement ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "turning now back to the discussion of three - body effects in @xmath3 photoproduction , the three - body calculation clearly predicts a much more prominent peak structure accompanied by a slight shift to lower energies .",
    "thus the difference between the solid and the dash - dotted curves demonstrates convincingly the importance of the higher order terms in the multiple scattering series for the intermediate @xmath2 interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that in the ` ideal case ' the measurement of the peak might be an indicator of the dynamical properties of the @xmath2 system .",
    "in particular , if a bound @xmath1 state would exist , it would appear in the @xmath58 channel as a pure @xmath17-wave three - body resonance .",
    "the mass difference @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mass of this hypothetic resonance , would then give the binding energy .",
    "if on the other hand the @xmath2 scattering amplitude possesses only a virtual pole , as is predicted by our model , the resonance peak should fall directly on the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "nevertheless , it is obvious that the extraction of such information would require a quite thorough partial wave analysis ( we need to consider only the @xmath17-wave contribution ) and , moreover , a very precise energy resolution and a small statistical error , which could then allow one to fix the resonance position .",
    "a similar scheme was already realized in the experiments aimed at a search for @xmath0 mesic nuclei with @xmath61he  @xcite and heavier targets  @xcite .",
    "but although the quality of the data permits one to make quite definite conclusion about the peak position , there are still problems with the interpretation of the measured angular distribution and the energy dependence of the corresponding cross section within existing theoretical models  @xcite .    ) with clas preliminary data  @xcite.,width=529 ]    a comparison of our results in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] with preliminary data from ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the theory underestimates the observed cross section at backward angles by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the same discrepancy is noted for the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the cross section is also far below the data in the same region .",
    "yet , the authors of  @xcite use an oversimplified operator for @xmath62 and it is therefore difficult to identify the prime reason of this drawback .",
    "furthermore , similar underestimation may be exhibited in the work of  @xcite , although the deviation is not as significant as in our case .    the noted discrepancy might not be very surprising after all .",
    "we can expect that as long as the pions are produced on the individual nucleons and as long as the angular dependence of the elementary amplitude @xmath8 is not varying strongly , the form of the differential cross section is mainly governed by the deuteron form factor . in order to locate the appropriate portion of the form factor which enters in the kinematical conditions , we present on the top x - axis in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the corresponding four momentum transfer squared .",
    "as one can see , its characteristic values range between 15 and 35 @xmath55 , where the form factor as seen in electron scattering exhibits a sizeable sensitivity to higher order mechanisms like @xmath56 and @xmath63 mec s ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is very probable that additional two - nucleon mechanisms , not included in the present calculation , will make sizeable contributions to the backward cross section .",
    "for example , meson exchange currents were found to be quite significant for @xmath64 photoproduction on @xmath61he in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the effect is associated with double meson photoproduction followed by absorption of one of the mesons on the spectator nucleon . however ,",
    "if such mechanisms are really quite important , their inclusion would tend to diminish the effect discussed above , i.e.  the relative size of the peak as its manifestation . in this case",
    ", we will have to face again the same question about the origin of the structure observed in the @xmath3 photoproduction .",
    "we have discussed various aspects of the influence of @xmath0 degrees of freedom on coherent @xmath3 photoproduction on the deuteron .",
    "two interrelated features determine the significance of the @xmath0 meson in this reaction .",
    "firstly , the strong coupling between @xmath48 and @xmath11 states in the energy region of the @xmath5 resonance leads to a significant admixture of the @xmath2 configuration to the @xmath65 intermediate states .",
    "what is more important , in contrast to pions , slow @xmath0 mesons interact strongly with nearby nucleons . as predicted in a variety of investigations , this dynamical feature leads to highly correlated @xmath2 states , which should manifest themselves in the @xmath17-wave part of the @xmath3 photoproduction amplitude .",
    "both factors lead to the appearance of a pronounced bump in the energy dependence of the backward differential cross section around the @xmath0 production threshold .",
    "this effect was analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a theoretical model where in addition to the mere impulse approximation @xmath56 and @xmath0 rescatterings were included .",
    "in contrast to the conclusion of  @xcite , we find that already in the impulse approximation a shoulder appears in the cross section around @xmath53 = 700 mev . however , as is explained in the present work , this effect does not have a deep physical significance , and is likely to reflect the special structure of the pion production amplitude used here .",
    "the inclusion of first - order rescattering and , finally , all terms in the multiple scattering series within a three - body model shifts the peak position and make it significantly more pronounced . in particular , it was shown that a three - body treatment of the @xmath2 interaction is of special importance for the understanding of the reaction dynamics .",
    "in general , according to our results , the physics behind the bump structure in the cross section for @xmath7 may be much more complicated than was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . among other things , we are very sceptical about the possibility to extract a model independent information on the fundamental @xmath11 interaction from the @xmath66 reactions .    the present calculation as well as those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered as a natural explanation of the experimental results reported in  @xcite . however , the status of these findings is quite unclear , because the theory strongly underestimates the data in the relevant angular region , making any quantitative analysis of the observed cross section impossible .",
    "further theoretical investigations in this field are certainly needed .",
    "the author would like to thank hartmuth arenhvel for useful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 443 ) .",
    "here we give a brief outline of the impulse approximation of the @xmath67-matrix of coherent pion photoproduction on the deuteron in the c.m .",
