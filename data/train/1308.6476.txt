    "the properties of hadronic matter at high density are poorly understood both theoretically and experimentally , and pose a challenge in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "they are critically concerned with such issues as the equation of state ( eos ) relevant for compact - star matter and the chiral symmetry breaking / restoration in dense matter .",
    "the sign problem in lattice qcd and the nonperturbative nature of the strong interaction in the effective field theory approaches restrict their applicability for dense matter studies .",
    "a series of works  @xcite have shown that the skyrmion approach , where the classical soliton solutions of the mesonic theory capturing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the large @xmath8 limit are interpreted as baryons , provides a natural framework for exploring dense baryonic matter without being obstructed by the notorious problems mentioned above . furthermore , it enables one to study the properties of dense matter and in - medium hadrons in a unified way  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the parameter dependence in the results of simple models that include only a few low - lying mesons , the skyrmion approach could not provide quantitatively meaningful predictions .",
    "recently , we have studied the skyrmion approach  @xcite using a chiral lagrangian , where the @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons are introduced as the gauge bosons of the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite with the @xmath0 terms in the chiral order expansion including all the homogeneous wess - zumino ( hwz ) terms taken into account .",
    "all the parameters of the lagrangian are fixed by their relations to the sakai - sugimoto s five - dimensional holographic qcd ( hqcd ) model  @xcite , while two parameters of the latter are fixed to yield the empirical values of the pion decay constant and the vector meson mass in matter - free space .",
    "we shall refer to this model as hls(@xmath9 ) .",
    "several remarkable results , qualitatively different from , or not observed in , the previous works on skyrmions were obtained in refs .",
    "we will return to some of them later .",
    "here we mention a few to illustrate the key issues that will concern what we treat in this paper .    *",
    "although the results show some discrepancies from nature , if one considers the fact that none of the parameters is adjusted with baryon properties , they could be taken as the first ",
    "parameter - free \" predictions of the skyrmion approach .",
    "furthermore , in spite of the limitations of the model such as the large @xmath8 , large t hooft constant ( @xmath10 ) , and chiral limits taken in the hqcd model , the semiquantitative agreement of the results with experiments is quite remarkable .",
    "* the full @xmath0 terms , in particular the hwz terms that carry the @xmath1 meson degree of freedom , are found to be essential for the soliton structure of elementary baryons .",
    "this highlights the particularly important role , thus far unexposed , played by the @xmath1 meson in the baryon structure .",
    "we assert that the lagrangian given up to @xmath0 can not be approximated by a few terms as was done in the past .",
    "* in dense matter simulated on the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) crystal , it is found that the transition from skyrmions to half - skyrmions accompanied by the vanishing quark condensate takes place near the normal nuclear matter density ( denoted by @xmath5 from here on ) in contrast to the case without the vector mesons and the @xmath0 terms . in the latter case ,",
    "the transition density , denoted @xmath11 , is much too high compared with @xmath5 .",
    "a qualitatively different feature found there , which has not been noticed in the past , is that the medium - modified pion decay constant @xmath12 that decreases smoothly up to @xmath11 roughly in the same way as in chiral perturbation calculations stops decreasing at @xmath11 and then stays more or less constant , although the space averaged quark condensation @xmath13 vanishes in the half - skyrmion phase .",
    "the nonvanishing @xmath12 in the half - skyrmion phase implies that the chiral symmetry remains still in the nambu - goldstone mode even though @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the quark condensate is not a good order parameter in the crystal description .",
    "* it is found that the medium - modified effective nucleon mass @xmath15 tracks closely @xmath16 , indicating that the large @xmath8 approximation continues to hold in medium .",
    "furthermore , in the half - skyrmion phase , the mass remains @xmath17 % of its vacuum value .",
    "the condensate - independent mass is reminiscent of the chiral - invariant baryon mass @xmath7 that figures in the parity - doublet baryon model  @xcite , but its physical origin is not clarified yet .",
    "we note that some of the features mentioned above are in disagreement with what was obtained in the mean field approximation  @xcite and in a naive formulation of hls in the meson sector  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they bring tension with the vector manifestation ( vm ) ) was used .",
    "of course the vanishing of the @xmath2 meson mass can never occur unless @xmath18 at the chiral restoration point identified with the vm . ] and the brown - rho ( br ) scaling .",
    "given that what we are dealing with here is an effective theory of qcd given in terms of the ",
    "macroscopic \" degrees of freedom , i.e. , hadrons , we need to match the effective theory to qcd at a certain scale at which the chiral symmetry gets restored . by matching the correlators of hls to those of qcd in the wilsonian sense",
    ", one finds that near the chiral restoration scale , here the putative critical density @xmath19 , the parameters in hls should satisfy the following relations : @xmath20 which are called  vector manifestation \" of the wigner realization of chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the matching between the effective theory and qcd renders the low energy constants ( lecs ) of the theory _ intrinsically density dependent_. however , if , as mentioned , @xmath16 stays as a nonzero constant in the half - skyrmion phase and @xmath21 does not scale in medium , it is not clear how to access the vm unless some other ( hadronic ) mechanism intervenes before the qcd degrees of freedom enter .",
    "the objective of this paper is to resolve this problem . for this",
    ", we resort to scale ( or conformal ) symmetry of qcd .",
    "it is well known that the chiral symmetry breaking and scale symmetry are intricately linked to each other and that chiral symmetry breaking could be triggered by spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry which in turn is caused by the presence of explicit scale symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "this is the mechanism that we exploit to investigate the possible realization of vm by incorporating the qcd trace anomaly in hls .",
    "we find that , with an appropriate inclusion of the scalar field associated with the explicit breaking of conformal symmetry , both vm and the br scaling  @xcite can be realized .",
    "there are a variety of reasons to believe that the scalar degree of freedom is needed in addition to those that figure in hls in the structure of both elementary baryon and multibaryon systems .",
    "firstly the skyrmion mass obtained in hls(@xmath9 )  @xcite overshoots the empirical nucleon mass by @xmath22  mev .",
    "one expects that the @xmath23 casimir energy , missing in the @xmath24 soliton mass , can account for the attraction needed of that amount .",
    "in the skyrme model , the casimir contribution comes from pion loops that account for the scalar channel and is of the right magnitude to lower the mass from the canonical @xmath25  mev down to @xmath26  mev  @xcite . secondly , in the mean field approach to nuclear matter , a ( chiral ) scalar mass of @xmath27  mev is indispensable for binding the matter , counterbalancing the repulsion from the @xmath1 meson exchange .",
    "closer to the problem at hand , the simulation of the nuclear property from the fcc crystal shows that the density @xmath28 at which the per - skyrmion energy is the minimum is larger than the normal nuclear density @xmath5 and the binding energy at @xmath28 is @xmath29  mev , which is larger than the empirical value @xmath30  mev per baryon  @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies also signal that there is something missing in the present skyrmion crystal description for the eos of nuclear matter in hls(@xmath9 ) .",
    "although there is such a defect in our approach , in fact , what we are suggesting here is that one can make predictions on certain fluctuation properties of hadrons on top of the skyrmion background which is treated semiclassically , which is what the simulation all about .",
    "the advantage of having the vector mesons as ( hidden ) gauge fields is that a systematic chiral perturbation theory can be formulated with vector mesons in addition to the pion  @xcite .",
    "introducing scalar fields in this framework is , however , highly problematic .",
    "what was done in the past and will be done here is to use the trick of the conformal compensator field or  conformon \" used in cosmology and also in the technidilaton approach to a higgs - like boson , to write a conformally invariant lagrangian with the conformal symmetry spontaneously broken by a coleman - weinberg - type potential . the conformon field",
    "is then identified as a ( pseudo-)nambu - goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry , i.e. , the dilaton .    in what follows",
    "we analyze in what way this dilaton resolves the problem mentioned above .",
    "this will reveal how it affects the structure of both the elementary nucleon and multibaryon systems at large density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sumhls ] , after a sketch of the general strategy of approaching elementary baryon and multibaryon systems with one single lagrangian anchored on hidden local symmetry , we introduce the dilaton associated with the scale symmetry breaking of qcd as a conformon to hls .",

    "the isosinglet vector meson @xmath1 plays a crucial role in the structure of both the elementary nucleon and multinucleon systems . given that the @xmath1 meson is in the topological term encoding anomaly , it can not be properly , if at all , captured in models that have no explicit @xmath1 degree of freedom such as the famous skyrme model or chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the density @xmath11 at which the skyrmion  half - skyrmion transition , a generic feature of all the skyrmion models on crystal , takes place is found to be not far from the equilibrium nuclear matter density @xmath284 @xmath285 .",
    "it is therefore testable experimentally , such as through the medium modified kaon mass  @xcite and nuclear tensor force  @xcite ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . without the @xmath2 and @xmath1 fields ,",
    "the transition takes place at much too low a density to be compatible with what is accurately known in normal nuclear matter , and without the hwz term  i.e. , without the @xmath1 meson it comes much too high to be relevant to nature .",
    "[ p1 ] in medium , the effective pion decay constant @xmath16 encoding the _ intrinsic _ density dependence is found to drop smoothly , roughly in consistency with chiral perturbation theory , to the density @xmath11 , but stops dropping at @xmath11 and remains constant @xmath286 of the free - space value in the half - skyrmion phase .",
    "[ p2 ] the in - medium nucleon mass @xmath15 tracks closely the in - medium pion decay constant @xmath16 ( multiplied by a scale - invariant factor proportional to @xmath287 ) which indicates that the large @xmath8 dominance holds in medium as it does in free space and stays constant @xmath286 of the free - space value in the half - skyrmion phase for @xmath288 .",
    "given that @xmath289 in the half - skyrmion phase , the constant nucleon mass must be a chirally invariant term in the lagrangian .",
    "this resembles the chiral - invariant @xmath7 term in the parity - doublet baryon model . in our calculation ,",
    "such a term is not explicitly present in the lagrangian with which the skyrmion crystal is constructed .",
    "therefore it could very well be a symmetry ",
    "emergent \" from many - body correlations different from what glozman interprets as an intrinsic property of qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the items [ p1 ] and [ p2 ] get support from independent analyses based on the one - loop rg flow with baryon hls ( bhls ) and mean - field approximation with dilaton - implemented bhls  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the qualitative structure of the half - skyrmion phase is correct .",
    "however , as pointed out in the present work , there is a tension with the vm and br scaling .",
    "this is because , since the pion decay constant and the @xmath2 meson mass stay constant and do not tend to the vm fixed point , one can not make the matching of the hls correlators to those of qcd crucial to describe chiral restoration at a certain high density @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    ", we remove the obstacle to the vm found in the hls crystal by the dilaton field associated with the spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry .",
    "we found that in order for the dilaton to retain the vm feature or br scaling , the @xmath58}_{\\rm hls}$ ] symmetry for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 which seems to hold in matter - free space has to be broken in medium . with the symmetry",
    "breaking induced in the vector meson mass rather than in the gauge coupling as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , all four features mentioned above were retained and , in addition , the tension with the vm present in the hls model ( without the dilaton ) could be removed .",
    "we should point out that there are some caveats to the  good \" results mentioned above .",
    "( 1 ) the energy of the system is minimized at a larger density than the known equilibrium density @xmath5 with a binding energy much larger than the empirical value .",
    "this is not surprising since we have here a large @xmath8 theory . in standard nuclear many - body theory anchored on effective field theory ,",
    "a similar overbinding and higher saturation density are obtained unless one introduces three- and multibody forces ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "whether this  higher - order \" effect is encoded in the crystal calculation needs to be clarified .",
    "( 2 ) in all cases considered , the density @xmath11 comes below the empirical value of @xmath5 , with the hls - ii giving @xmath11 close to @xmath5 . from the phenomenology discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the density @xmath11 most likely relevant to nature should be @xmath290 .",
    "however , it seems that there will be no difficulty even if @xmath11 comes close to but above @xmath5 .",
    "( 3 ) the half - skyrmion structure is a classical picture , already present in the skyrmion description of mass number 4 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and will surely be modified by quantum effects .",
    "it is interesting to compare what we have found in this paper to what have been seen in other developments , which are closely related to each other .",
    "* phenomenologically relevant is the application of the skyrmion  half - skyrmion topology change to an effective nuclear field theory description of the eos for compact stars  @xcite . using the notion that topology change can be  translated \" into the parameter change of an effective lagrangian ,",
    "here in the form of the  intrinsic density dependence \" defined above , an effective nuclear lagrangian was constructed by means of renormalization group equations and applied to calculating a high - order nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the principal observation there was that in order to correctly describe nuclear matter and then extrapolate to higher density , it was essential that the effective nucleon mass drop smoothly to @xmath293 up to density @xmath294 and then stay constant up to the density @xmath295 predicted to be present in the interior of a massive neutron star and that the @xmath296 coupling be more or less unscaled in the density regime involved .",
    "this is roughly the feature obtained in dhls - ii . *",
    "suppose we follow the development made in ref .",
    "@xcite using the mean - field approximation in dhls - i , supplemented with explicit baryon degrees of freedom and @xmath58}_{\\rm hls}$ ] symmetry breaking in the gauge coupling constants instead of in the vector meson masses . in the dhls - i(@xmath9 ) crystal calculation , the corresponding procedure would be to replace @xmath57 with a density - dependent one in the form of @xmath297 where @xmath5 is the normal nucleon density and @xmath298 is a parameter .",
    "we refer to this model as dhls - ia and present the obtained results for the per skyrmion energy and @xmath275 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhlsiii720 ] for two cases with @xmath299 and @xmath300 , respectively .",
    "the dilaton mass is taken to be @xmath301  mev , as before .",
    "our result shows that to arrive at the minimum of @xmath194 , a smaller parameter @xmath298 is preferred .",
    "it clearly shows that there is a density region after @xmath11 in which the nucleon mass is nearly density independent .",
    "this agrees with the observation made in ref .",
    "note that because of the density - dependent coupling @xmath57 , @xmath11 is pushed to a higher density by the dilaton .",
    "* in the hls calculation , we find that , in the half - skyrmion phase , the space average @xmath262 , but @xmath302 although it is a small density - dependent quantity .",
    "this observation might indicate that , although the space average quarkonia condensate vanishes in the half - skyrmion phase , the space average tetraquark condensate does not .",
    "probably this is the first example which realizes the chiral symmetry breaking pattern @xmath303 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite _ emergent _ in dense baryonic matter , whose features of the thermodynamic quantities and hadron mass spectra of this phase in the two flavor case are explored in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if one assumes the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation holds in the half - skyrmion phase in the form @xmath304 , with @xmath305 a density - independent constant , then since @xmath306 drops to a small value while @xmath12 remains more or less constant , one should expect @xmath307 should accordingly decrease fast in the half - skyrmion phase in the real world where the pion mass is nonzero .",
    "this would imply that the contribution from the pion exchange to the nuclear tensor forces will be enhanced for density @xmath308 and hence will increase the net tensor - force attraction , as is clear from the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite . as was pointed out a long time ago by pandharipande and smith  @xcite",
    ", such an enhanced tensor force could lead to a p - wave @xmath309-condensed neutron solid at high density in compact stars . *",
    "a remarkable feature that has been uncovered in all models anchored on hls is that at a certain density above the normal nuclear matter density , the effective nucleon mass @xmath15 stops being dependent on the chiral condensate , saturating at @xmath310 of the free - space mass , and then stays constant until quark deconfinement .",
    "we note that this is reminiscent of the chiral - invariant mass @xmath7 posited in the parity - doublet baryon model .",
    "the mass @xmath7 could be an intrinsic quantity of qcd proper in the sense suggested in ref .",
    "however , the parity - doublet baryon model is an effective theory . now in our treatment , the chiral - invariant mass  that breaks explicitly conformal invariance  is not put in _ ab initio _ in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that it rather reflects an emergent symmetry due to hls skyrmion interactions , and not an intrinsic one .",
    "we note that since what we are looking at is a process of  unbreaking symmetry \" by density , this indicates a subtle mechanism by which the nucleon mass could have been generated .",
