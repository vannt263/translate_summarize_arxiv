    "qualitatively , a neutron star is analogous to a white dwarf star , with the pressure due to degenerate neutrons rather than degenerate electrons .",
    "general relativity is significant for neutron stars , and the simplest models are found by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations @xcite , which are derived from einstein s equations in the schwarzschild metric for a static , spherical star composed of an ideal gas .",
    "the assumption that the neutrons in a neutron star can be treated as an ideal gas is not well justified : the effect of the strong force needs to be taken into account by replacing the equation of state ( eos ) for an ideal gas by a more realistic eos .",
    "neutron stars can be regarded as laboratories for testing different hypotheses relating to the eos through their influence on the properties of neutron star models , including radius , mass , central density and kepler frequency .",
    "the effect of many possible eos have been studied in this context @xcite .",
    "one class of eos is based on the assumption that the neutron star is composed only of hadrons @xcite , plus an essential small admixture of electrons . in order to construct appropriate eos for these hadronic stars ,",
    "one must rely on models which describe nuclear matter bulk properties .",
    "another possibility is that the interior of the neutron star includes quarks ; such models are known as _ quark _",
    "stars @xcite or _ hybrid _ stars @xcite . in hybrid stars low density regions",
    "are composed of hadronic matter , but in high density regions , a deconfinement of the quarks from the hadrons occurs , leading to a quark phase .",
    "many different eos have been built , including eos for the phase immediately after the formation of the neutron star when the neutrinos are still trapped @xcite , and for the subsequent ( deleptonized ) phase after the neutrinos escape @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the interior of a neutron - like star does not consist primarily of neutrons , but rather of the strange matter .",
    "strange matter is composed of deconfined quarks , including up , down and strange quarks , plus the leptons necessary to ensure charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "this possibility arises because at the high densities present in the interior of neutron stars , a phase transition from hadronic to quark phase is possible @xcite .",
    "approximately one third of the quarks are strange quarks , with the exact fraction depending on the model used to describe the quark phase .",
    "for example , the strangeness content is slightly lower for the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite than for the mit bag model @xcite , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that strange matter is the true ground state of all matter , and if this is the case , then as soon as the core of the star converts to the quark phase , the entire star converts .",
    "this led to the suggestion that there may be no neutron stars , and that all neutron - like stars and in fact strange stars @xcite .",
    "further evidence in favor of strange stars is the fact that some stars seem to rotate faster that what would be expected from a neutron star @xcite .",
    "neutron stars are gravitationally bound with the pressure approaching zero as the density approaches zero .",
    "strange stars , on the other hand , are self - bound by the strong interaction and gravity is not necessary for their stability . in this case",
    "the pressure goes to zero at a finite density , so that there is a sharp change in density at the surface of a strange star .",
    "the restriction on the rotational speed of a gravitationally bound star , such that does not break up due to the centrifugal acceleration exceeding the gravitational acceleration at the equator of the star , does not apply to a strange star . hence",
    ", strange stars can rotate faster than neutron stars .",
    "a strange star must have a thin layer on its surface dominated by the electrons which are necessary to enforce charge neutrality .",
    "this layer could suspend a hadronic crust , which would not be in contact with the stellar core @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the presence of a crust provides a natural explanation for pulsar glitches @xcite , which are sudden changes in the rotation period of the pulsar .",
    "other authors have argued against the presence of a crust @xcite , and that strange stars should be bare .",
    "recently , @xcite identified some possible characteristics of the radiation that would come from hot , bare strange stars .",
    "in this paper we focus on the different possible models for strange matter and their implications for models of strange stars . besides the mit bag model @xcite ,",
    "normally used for strange stars , more sophisticated models are the color - favor - locked phase ( cfl ) @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "we consider only the mit and the cfl models here .",
    "we also discuss the effects of the inclusion of a crust , not only in strange stars , for which the crust is not in contact with the interior , but also for hadronic and hybrid stars for which it is in contact with the interior .",
    "we calculate the kepler frequencies using a prescription given in @xcite to test the hypothesis that strange stars can rotate faster than neutron stars .",
    "finally , we also investigate how changes in the eos affect the star properties within the temperature range of 10@xmath0 .",
    "in this section we summarize the models we use to describe the properties of quark matter .",
    "the mit bag model @xcite has been used extensively to describe quark matter . in its simplest form ,",
    "the quarks are considered to be free inside a bag and the thermodynamic properties are derived by treating them as an ideal fermi gas .",
    "the energy density , the pressure and the quark @xmath1 density , respectively , are given by @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the number of colors , @xmath6 for the spin degeneracy , @xmath7 for the quark masses , @xmath8 represents the bag pressure .",

    "we assume the masses @xmath12 , @xmath13 and adopt different values for the bag constant @xmath8 .",
    "the foregoing equations apply at arbitrary temperature . for @xmath14 , there are no antiparticles , the chemical potential is equal to the fermi energy , and the distribution functions for the particles is the usual step functions @xmath15 . for neutron stars ,",
    "the typical temperatures are somewhat lower than the fermi temperatures , and the approximation @xmath14 is normally made .      in a star with quark matter",
    "we must impose both charge neutrality and equilibrium for the weak interactions , referred to as @xmath16 equilibrium @xcite . in this work",
    "we only consider the stage after deleptonization when the neutrinos have escaped . in this case",
    "the neutrino chemical potential is zero . for matter in @xmath16 equilibrium",
    "we must add the contribution of the leptons as free fermi gases ( electrons and muons ) to the energy and pressure .",
    "the relations between the chemical potentials of the different particles are given by the @xmath16-equilibrium conditions @xmath17 for charge neutrality we must impose @xmath18 for the electron and muon densities we have @xmath19 where the distribution functions for the leptons are given by substituting @xmath1 by @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ distf ] ) , with @xmath21 the chemical potential for leptons of type @xmath20 . at @xmath14 , equation ( [ rhol ] ) becomes @xmath22 the pressure for the leptons is @xmath23      recently many authors @xcite have discussed the possibility that the quark matter is in a color - superconducting phase , in which quarks near the fermi surface are paired , forming cooper pairs which condense and break the color gauge symmetry @xcite . at sufficiently high density the favored phase is called cfl , in which quarks of all three colors and all three flavors are allowed to pair .    in this section",
    "we study the equation of state taking into consideration a cfl quark paired phase .",
    "we treat the quark matter as a fermi sea of free quarks with an additional contribution to the pressure arising from the formation of the cfl condensates .",
    "the cfl phase can be described with the thermodynamic potential @xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the neutron chemical potential , and @xmath27 @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 is a contribution from the goldstone bosons arising due to the chiral symmetry breaking in the cfl phase @xcite , @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 is the negative of expression ( [ pressl ] ) , and the quark number densities are equal , i.e. , @xmath35 in the above expressions @xmath36 , the gap parameter , is taken to be @xmath37 @xcite .    the electric charge density carried by the pion condensate",
    "is given by @xmath38    for the case of strange stars , charge neutrality has to be enforced .",
    "hence , we take @xmath39 in the above expressions so that @xmath40 vanishes . in writing down the thermodynamic potential ,",
    "we neglect the contribution due to the kaon condensation , which is an effect of order @xmath41 and hence is small compared with the@xmath42 contribution to the thermodynamic potential for @xmath43 .",
    "in order to describe the crust of hadronic , hybrid and strange stars we use the well known eos calculated in @xcite for very low densities . this is justified because all our codes only run up to subnuclear densities of the order of 0.01 @xmath44 and the crust can , in principle , bear much lower densities .",
    "next we investigate the differences arising from different eos for strange matter . in figure [ eoscrust ]",
    "we plot the eos obtained from the bag model for three values of the bag constants .",
    "one can see a clear discontinuity between the hadronic crust and the inner strange matter .",
    "this plot is similar to the one shown in @xcite .",
    "the differences arising from different bag values appear only at reasonably large energy densities but do affect the properties of the stars . in particular , the larger the bag value , the larger the gap between the crust and the core of the strange star .",
    "note the units : @xmath45 .",
    "in figure [ strangeeos ] we show the differences in stiffness in the eos obtained from the bag and the cfl models within the range of energy densities where they are used .    in previous studies of hybrid stars containing a core of quark matter @xcite it was found that stable stars are sensitive to the @xmath8 value . in a hybrid star with the quark phase described by a cfl model , for a given gap constant @xmath36 a phase transition to a deconfined cfl phase",
    "was found possible only for @xmath8 greater than a critical value . for lower values",
    "pure quark matter stars were found . for @xmath46 one should have @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath48 it was not possible to obtain stable stars with masses equal to most of known radio - pulsar masses . in the present work we also vary the value of the bag constant to check its influence on the properties of the strange stars .    given the eos , the next step is to solve the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations @xcite : @xmath49\\left[m+ 4\\pi r^3 p\\right ] } { ( r-2 gm ) } , \\label{tov1}\\ ] ] @xmath50 with @xmath51 as the gravitational constant and @xmath52 as the gravitational mass inside radius @xmath53 .",
    "we use units with @xmath54 .",
    "these equations are integrated from the origin for a given choice of the central energy density , @xmath55 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 , where the pressure vanishes defines the surface of the star .",
    "in figure [ tovall ] we plot the mass radius relations of various kinds of stars . in order to understand the role of the crust in each one of them , we display the results of each kind with and without its crust . once the crust is inserted into the eos , the radius of the star changes its behaviour .",
    "one can compare three sets of stars : hadronic , hybrid and strange stars . in all of them ,",
    "if no crust is considered , the radius slightly increases and then decreases as the mass decreases .",
    "once the crust is inserted into the eos , the radius becomes very large beyond a certain critical mass .",
    "actually , the radius can increase up to huge values if densities as low as @xmath57 @xmath58 are considered . in order to plot this figure for the hadronic and hybrid stars we choose",
    "the eos derived in @xcite , where the hybrid stars were obtained by the enforcement of gibbs criterion for phase coexistence . in this case , the eos is smooth and no discontinuities are present .",
    "notice that the results for the hybrid stars seems to interpolate between the results for hadronic and strange stars .",
    "although the general plots of the stars with and without crust look somewhat different , more so for strange stars than for hadronic or hybrid stars , and also the effect of a crust is weaker on the properties of stars near maximum mass .",
    "in figure [ tovquarks ] we display the mass radius relations of strange stars .",
    "our aim here is to compare different quark models and for this purpose the inclusion of the crust is not necessary . in both models considered ,",
    "i.e. , mit bag or cfl model , the bag constant was taken as @xmath59 , 180 and @xmath60 . in what follows",
    ", mit145 always refers to the bag model with a bag constant equal to @xmath61 , cfl211 refers to the cfl model with @xmath62 and so on .",
    "both models show a decrease in the maximum mass with increasing bag constant , which effect is evident from table  i.    in table  i we show the stellar properties for the eos discussed above , namely , the maximum gravitational and baryonic masses , the central energy density and the radius of the star with the maximum mass .",
    "we do not include the maximum radius because it can vary depending on how low in density we go with the bps eos .",
    "with few exceptions , the maximum gravitational mass increases , the maximum baryonic mass decreases , the radius increases and the central energy density decreases when the crust is included .",
    "we also include a calculation of the kepler frequency , which determines the spin rate of a neutron star .",
    "based on a simplification of the kepler frequency for a rigid body , the authors of reference @xcite found that the maximum rotation rate ( in hertz ) for a star of mass @xmath63 , not close to the maximum mass , and nonrotating radius @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 we use this prescription to estimate the kepler frequency and its related period .",
    "we calculate frequencies and periods only for stars without the crust . in a strange star ,",
    "the crust and the core are not connected and one can not assume rigid body ; a detailed discussion on this point is given in @xcite .    as a final example , we consider the eos for the mit bag model for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which covers the highest temperatures , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , considered for the surface of a bare strange star @xcite . in table",
    "ii we display the strange star properties for these temperatures and in figure [ tovtpt ] the corresponding mass radius curves .",
    "one sees that for the bag value of @xmath70 , the @xmath66 and @xmath67 results are somewhat similar , and for @xmath62 the @xmath14 and @xmath66 mev are essentially indistinguishable ; our codes do not have enough precision to distinguish temperatures so close to each other .",
    "the measurement of the gravitational redshift of spectral lines produced in a neutron star photosphere can provide a direct constraint on the mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "a redshift of 0.35 from three different transitions of the spectra of the x - ray binary exo0748 - 676 was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this redshift corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "another constraint on the mass to radius ratio is from the observation of two absorption features in the source spectrum of the 1e 1207.45209 neutron star , which gives @xmath72 to @xmath73 @xcite . in this second case",
    ", however , the interpretation of the absorption features as atomic transition lines is controversial . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors claim that the aborption features are cyclotron line , which imply no obvious constraint on the redshift . in figures",
    "[ tovall ] and [ tovquarks ] we add the lines corresponding to these constraints .",
    "all the models analyzed in this paper are consistent with the constraints .",
    "while the hadronic and hybrid equations of state are not consistent with the complete set of constraints , the strange stars , either crusted or bare , are consistent with all constraints .",
    "a similar conclusion concerning strange stars was reached in @xcite .    from table",
    "i it follows that strange stars can rotate much faster than either hybrid or hadronic stars , and can have periods as short as 0.4 to @xmath74 . for comparison ,",
    "the highest observed spin rate from pulsar psr b1937 + 21 is @xmath75 @xcite , and this value is consistent with the pulsar being an ordinary neutron star .",
    "however , according to @xcite , if a period less that @xmath76 were found , this would be strong evidence that the star must be bound more tightly than by gravity alone , implying a strange star .",
    "however , whereas extreme rotation speed can rule out a neutron star , actually , as pointed out in @xcite , in other cases it is difficult to distinguish a strange star from a neutron star . from table  ii one can conclude that , although strange stars are thought of as hot objects , characterized by super - eddington luminosities , it is reasonable to neglect the temperature ( and to assume @xmath14 ) in a detailed investigation of quark matter .",
    "the possible existence of pentaquarks , that is four quarks and one antiquark confined inside an exotic baryon , has been discussed in the literature @xcite . this hypothesis was confirmed in 2002 , when a narrow baryon of strangeness @xmath77 and mass equal to @xmath78 was detected @xcite .",
    "the effective mass of a nucleon at nuclear saturation density is about 30% less than the mass of a free nucleon and a pentaquark is stable only if its effective mass in the medium decreases more than the nucleon effective mass , a condition which is probably not satisfied .",
    "however , if it is satisfied , it may also be a possibility for the quark matter in strange stars .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the nambu - jona - lasinio @xcite is also a much richer model than the models used in the present work and it should also be considered in the description of strange matter .",
    "these two possibilities are currently under investigation .",
    "this work was partially supported by capes ( brazil ) under process bex 1681/04 - 4 .",
    "d.p.m . would like to thank the friendly atmosphere at the reserch centre for theoretical astrophysics in the sydney university , where this work was done and dr constana providncia for the careful reading of the manuscript and useful comments .",
