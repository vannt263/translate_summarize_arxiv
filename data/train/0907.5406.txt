    "with increasing interest in the various long  anticipated potential applications to condensed matter and nuclear physics of gauge / gravity duality techniques such as ads / cft and its generalisations@xcite , it has been of considerable interest to understand how to cleanly capture the physics of the fermi surface of strongly coupled systems using holographic methods .",
    "this is because of the potential utility the methods might have to complement and extend the already impressive and ubiquitous power of the fermi liquid paradigm , and also because there is a wealth of experimental phenomena that suggest that there are fermi liquids that have behaviour that lies beyond the reach of standard techniques .",
    "holographic methods may allow access to such behaviour .",
    "recently , the work of ref.@xcite presented convincing evidence for the fermi surface of the strongly interacting 2 + 1 dimensional system at zero temperature and finite density that is holographically dual@xcite to an extremal electrically charged reissner  nordstrm black hole in four dimensional anti  de sitter spacetime ( ads@xmath0 ) .",
    "( that work continued and refined the important initial studies presented in ref.@xcite , and there has been further discussion and extension of this particular line of development in refs.@xcite .",
    "see also ref.@xcite for a discussion of possible holographic descriptions of fermi surfaces in a different context . )    a key observation of ref.@xcite was the fact that the fermi liquid had distinctly non  landau behaviour , showing unusual dispersion characteristics of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected , not just because the system is strongly coupled ( remember that landau fermi  liquids arise in strongly coupled contexts too ) , but because one might anticipate that the effectively weakly coupled quasiparticle theory that arises ( after strong coupling dressing ) in the vicinity of the fermi surface ought not to have a ( simple ) gravitational dual .",
    "when all is said and done , it is , after all , just a free field theory .",
    "one might wonder , however , what range of dispersion characteristics might be accessible using holographic duals , and in particular how close one can get to landau  like behaviour for a given system . the recent work of ref.@xcite answers some of this by doing a careful analysis of the ads@xmath1 throat region region ( first discussed in this holographic context in ref.@xcite ) that appears near the horizon of the black hole at zero temperature .",
    "much of the physics of the critical exponents can be traced to the ir physics located down this throat and is controlled by the masses of fields there .",
    "our work shows a different way of deforming the critical behaviour . as we will show , adding a magnetic field moves the dispersion of the quasiparticle spectrum back _ toward _ landau  like behaviour , in a manner that may have precise experimental analogues , especially given how natural magnetic fields are as laboratory probes and control parameters in a condensed matter context .",
    "moreover , we find that at a given value of the magnetic field @xmath2 ( below what appears to be a certain limiting value @xmath3 ) , multiple quasiparticle peaks can appear in the spectrum , representing a _ finite _ series of levels ( a kind of `` band '' structure ) .",
    "our boundary condition is such that we are at the zeroth landau level , so the levels we see are not the infinite family of equally spaced landau ",
    "rabi levels known from weak coupling intuition .    to introduce a background magnetic field @xmath2 we simply add magnetic charge to the ads@xmath0rn black hole , making it a dyon .",
    "we then study the system by probing it ( as done in the @xmath4 case ) with a minimally coupled dirac fermion of electric charge @xmath5 .",
    "we compute the retarded green s function associated with this probe , from which , after fourier transforming to momentum",
    " frequency space @xmath6 , we extract our physics .    generically , it can be seen that the magnetic field shifts the effective mass of the fermion , which translates into a deformation of effective dimension of the operator we are probing the theory with . following the discussion in refs.@xcite , it is not hard to infer that this will certainly affect the dispersion of the resulting quasiparticle peaks , but this needs to be explored explicitly , and this is what we report on in this paper .",
    "the metric for the dyonic black hole in asymptotically ads@xmath0 spacetime , using cartesian coordinates is@xcite : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the length scale set by the negative cosmological constant @xmath9 in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gravitational coupling and our signature is @xmath12 .",

    "the horizon of the hole is at @xmath15 .",
    "we choose our gauge such that the gauge field can be written in the following form : @xmath16 the electric component sets , by virtue of its value on the boundary , a chemical potential @xmath17 for the @xmath18 charge , while the magnetic component determines a background magnetic field of magnitude @xmath19.the parameter @xmath20 has dimensions of inverse length . for simplicity , in the sequel",
    "we make the following redefinitions so that we are working entirely in terms of dimensionless fields and coordinates : @xmath21      we consider the dirac action in this background : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the covariant derivative given by : @xmath24 and @xmath25 are world indices and @xmath26 are tangent  space indices .",

    "the solution is given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are functions independent of @xmath40 .",
    "the various relationships between the various powers of @xmath40 is relevant for the ads / cft dictionary @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if we restrict ourselves to @xmath41 , then the source of the dual operator is proportional to @xmath39 , and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the operator is proportional to @xmath38 . in this case , the dimension of the operator is given by : @xmath42 we now proceed away from @xmath14 and further decompose the two  component fields @xmath43 as : @xmath44 and make the following choices for the @xmath45 s : @xmath46 and these fields satisfy the following coupled equations of motion @xmath47 \\ ,",

    "henceforth we will work at zero temperature .",
    "this means , from equation  ( [ eqn : massandtemperature ] ) that there is a relation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 that we must bear in mind : @xmath50 in particular , note that ( we temporarily restore @xmath20 for this discussion ) the chemical potential @xmath51 naively gets shifted from its @xmath52 value due to this relation . also of note",
    "is the fact that as @xmath49 increases , @xmath48 must decrease in order to keep the temperature vanishing .",
    "there is a maximum value of @xmath49 , @xmath53 , at which @xmath48 vanishes .",
    "this is all to be physically interpreted for our system as follows .",
    "first , we need to decide what physical quantity we are holding fixed while adding magnetic field to the system .",
    "a good such quantity is the chemical potential @xmath51 .",
    "even though @xmath48 decreases for non  zero @xmath49 , we simply increase @xmath20 to hold it at the same value that it was at zero @xmath49.(according to equation  ( [ eqn : massandtemperature ] ) , this increases the energy density @xmath54 of the field theory , but this is quite natural as the magnetic field lifts the available energy levels of all charged particles . ) writing @xmath55",
    "we can write @xmath56 so that @xmath57 is fixed as @xmath58 . meanwhile we see that the physical magnetic field @xmath59 goes to infinity , showing that we do not have a limiting _ physical _ applied magnetic field .      in order to satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions at the event horizon ,",
    "we redefine the fields as follows ( for @xmath60 ; see subsection  [ sec : omegazero ] for a comment on the @xmath61 case ) : @xmath62 with this field redefinition , the equations of motion expanded at the event horizon give the following conditions : @xmath63 this result suggests that the `` correct '' variables to study the problem are actually : @xmath64 @xmath65 the equations of motion are now given by : @xmath66 at the event horizon , we impose the following condition : @xmath67 which has solution given by : @xmath68 this solution can be understood as an infinite sum of the separable solutions of the problem in terms of the coordinate @xmath69 .",
    "for this reason , we refer to this solution as the `` infinite  sum '' solution .",
    "we elaborate more on this relationship in our companion paper  @xcite .",
    "this boundary condition restricts us to the zeroth landau level .",
    "this then leaves us with the following conditions at the event horizon : @xmath70 @xmath71 which solution is chosen depends on the direction of the magnetic field . for the rest of our analysis",
    ", we stick to the solution with @xmath72 which means we have negative @xmath49 .    in all that follows , we restrict ourselves to @xmath73 for our probe fermion . by the ads / cft dictionary , this means we are turning on operators with dimension @xmath74 .",
    "this case was studied in great detail for the case of @xmath75 in ref .",
    "@xcite .      following the prescription for extracting the green s function from ref .",
    "@xcite , the green s function is given by ( assuming @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 which in term of our fields @xmath78 and @xmath79 gives : @xmath80 note that these fields are given in momentum ",
    "space and not position  space .",
    "a subtlety here is that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fields always had a separable form with respect to the ads radial coordinate and the space  time coordinates of the field theory , whereas here this is not the case .",
    "we assume that the prescription continues to hold and we simply fourier transform our fields at the ads boundary and use the result in the prescription .      for the special case of @xmath81 , the condition @xmath82 is no longer required .",
    "in fact , we need to change the behavior of the fields at the event horizon .",
    "consider first the @xmath75 case .",
    "we go back to equations  ( [ eqt : field_redef_1 ] ) and make the following redefinition : @xmath83 the exponent of the @xmath84 term is chosen such that there is a non  zero solution for the fields .",
    "now we define @xmath78 and @xmath79 as before , and find the following condition at the event horizon : @xmath85 in particular , if we take @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 , and we get for our green s functions at the event horizon : @xmath88 another independent solution is to take : @xmath89 which gives at the event horizon : @xmath90 again if we take @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 but with the green s function gives as : @xmath91 if we now turn on @xmath49 , the situation becomes much more complicated .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath78 and @xmath79 at the horizon require a more complicated exponent for @xmath84 in their behaviour . for our purposes",
    ", we will have no need to focus on the case of @xmath61 and determine these exponents since the interesting physics ( specifically , the quasiparticle peaks ) will appear away from @xmath61 .",
    "we will therefore not pursue this further in the present work .",
    "recalling that we will work with @xmath73 henceforth , we begin by considering the trivial case of a separable solution which occurs for @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath93 in this case , the four equations of motion reduce to two : @xmath94 therefore in the separable case , @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , looking at the initial conditions at the event horizon for @xmath96 , we find that @xmath97 , and therefore we can consistently take @xmath98 . therefore , we automatically get that @xmath99 .",
    "+ the other separable solution occurs for @xmath75 , and our solution should match those of ref .  @xcite . in this case , we can take : @xmath100 choosing @xmath101 we do indeed recover the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , as we show in figure [ fig : h=0 ] .     and",
    "@xmath102 using mathematica s ndsolve , width=192 ]    these two cases of separable solutions provide good test cases for the accuracy of numerical procedure when we solve the infinite  sum cases next .    before proceeding , we emphasize that our separable ansatz in equation ( [ eqt : ansatz_separable ] ) only considers the zeroth order hermite function .",
    "the ansatz can be generalized for higher order hermite functions , the physics of which we study in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to solve the problem with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we choose to discretize the equations of motion using a `` fully  implicit '' method : @xmath105 where we have defined : @xmath106 the problem is now to solve a large number of linear equations at each @xmath40 step .",
    "the associated matrix is of block tri  diagonal form , i.e. : @xmath107 where each of the @xmath108 s are matrices ( @xmath109 matrices in this case ) .",
    "this matrix can be inverted using a `` forward elimination ",
    "backward substitution '' method .",
    "the first test of our numerical method is to reproduce the known separable results we describe above .",
    "we present the result for @xmath75 , ( with @xmath110 and non ",
    "zero @xmath111 ) in figures [ fig : h=0_c++ ] and  [ fig : h=0_scaling ] , demonstrating with the latter that we can reproduce the correct quasiparticle peak and its associate scaling behaviour .",
    "it is interesting to test the case of @xmath112 .",
    "we find considerable deviation from the expected answer of @xmath113",
    ". we can understand this completely as arising from numerical error .",
    "the field @xmath114 at the boundary should be zero in this case , but it turns out to be proportional to the derivative of the @xmath39 s .",
    "it is straight  forward to understand this discrepancy : it comes from the finite difference approximation to the @xmath115derivative , which has zeros for non ",
    "zero @xmath49 at zero @xmath111 , causing a loss of accuracy .",
    "given that we have rotational symmetry , we can choose , without loss of generality , to put all our momentum into @xmath111 and work in the more well  behaved @xmath110 sector for the remainder of our investigations .",
    "we are now ready to numerically explore @xmath116 landscape for various @xmath49 , searching for quasiparticle poles in the green s function .",
    "there are several important general features that we encountered in our numerical explorations , and we collect them all together here .",
    "* for a given magnetic field , as @xmath111 is increased , a region appears where im(@xmath117 ) is negative for values of @xmath118 .",
    "we explain the meaning of this region below , but we illustrate in figure [ fig : gapbehavior ] how @xmath119 behaves as we increase @xmath111 for fixed magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we note that as @xmath120 , the behavior of @xmath119 is linear and appears to remain a fixed distance from the @xmath121 line . for higher magnetic fields , the separation from the line decreases . *",
    "we find a peak for values of @xmath122 .",
    "we refer to the position of the peak as @xmath123 .",
    "we show samples of the behavior of @xmath123 in figure [ fig : ridgebehavior ] .",
    "this is the ridge of ref .",
    "@xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : ridgebehavior ] , one sees that as the magnetic field is increased , the ridge gets closer to the @xmath124 line , crosses it , and continues to approach it from above ( see figure [ fig : ridge0.35 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the ridge always remains above the gap line ( except when they meet ) .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : ridge_gap_behavior ] .",
    "we also show an example of the large @xmath111 behavior for different magnetic fields in figure [ fig : large_kx_behavior ] . +    ( red ) and @xmath123 ( blue ) at fixed @xmath125 , width=240 ] * for a fixed value of @xmath49 , when @xmath126 at some @xmath127 , we find a pole in im@xmath117 .",
    "notice that this means that a pole appears whenever the ridge curve touches the gap curve .",
    "we find that the curves never cross but bounce off each other .",
    "we show an example of such a pole in figure [ fig : pole_behavior ] .",
    "this is a quasiparticle peak .",
    "it indicates a fermi surface at @xmath128 .",
    "away from the poles , the numerical results should be interpreted carefully since there one should consider a complex @xmath129 and not a purely real  @xmath129 . this is relevant because in our numerics the poles occur immediately after a region where the imaginary part of the green function is negative , which is not allowed if the theory is unitary .",
    "we believe that the proper treatment of the complex @xmath129 in these regions would resolve this .",
    "+ the fact that @xmath130 tells us that the fermi energy @xmath131 is greater than the @xmath18 chemical potential @xmath57 .",
    "this is quite natural : the physical magnetic field @xmath132 has lifted the energy of the charged particle , as earlier discussed .",
    "( note that we see peaks for negative @xmath129 as well , but focus on positive @xmath129 for physical interpretation . )",
    "+ in particular , we note that the behavior is very reminiscent of the behavior of the full green s function ( that includes both the advanced and retarded green s function ) at the fermi surface where both quasiparticles and quasiholes are observed .",
    "it is also important to note that there can be multiple ( but we believe only a finite number ) such peaks , at a given @xmath49 , appearing at distinct values @xmath133 .",
    "+    for @xmath134 at @xmath111 = 0.871847 , width=240 ] * there exists a maximum magnitude of the magnetic field at approximately @xmath135 above which we do not find any poles .",
    "we notice that above this maximum , the ridge remains above the @xmath124 line for all values of @xmath111 and the gap remains below the line , preventing the two from meeting .",
    "we explain in the following subsection what this maximum corresponds to .",
    "we proceed to study the scaling properties of the poles observed in im@xmath136 .",
    "we present samples of the results in figure [ fig : w_scaling ] .",
    "we find that the behavior near the pole seems very close to linear once @xmath137 , if approaching from below or above .",
    "contrast this with the case of @xmath75 ( discovered in ref.@xcite , recomputed here and displayed in figure  [ fig : h=0_scaling ] ) .",
    "however , as one can see from the figure , there is always a change in slope as we go from @xmath138 to @xmath139 .",
    "this suggests that there is perhaps curvature to the lines infinitesimally close to @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the system is still in a non  landau fermi liquid regime but with a scaling less than that found for the @xmath75 case .",
    "crucially , we see that as we increase the magnetic field , the slopes of the two lines begin to approach each other .",
    "our results suggest that when the slopes approach the limit of being equal , that is exactly when we no longer find any poles .",
    "this seems to be the mechanism by which the system protects itself from becoming a simple ( linear ) landau fermi liquid , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "in addition , we note that when there are are multiple poles present ( for a given @xmath49 ) , the dispersion behavior of the poles may not be the same .",
    "we present an example of this in figure [ fig : w_scaling_fixed_h ] .",
    "the results suggest that the further along the ridge one finds a pole , the more the behavior of the pole approaches that of a landau fermi liquid ( _ i.e. , _ linear dispersion ) .",
    "this suggests why there may only be a finite number of poles for a fixed magnetic field , since as we saw earlier , beyond a certain @xmath49 , or far enough along the ridge , the ridge and gap no longer cross .",
    "we ve found a rich set of physical results ( the deformation of dispersion characteristics , and the discrete fermi levels ) from our holographic studies of the fermi surface and quasiparticle spectrum in a background magnetic field .",
    "we expect that there is even more rich physics to be found from these systems .",
    "it is very exciting that some of these phenomena seem akin to the sorts of strongly coupled physics that are experimentally accessible , including with background magnetic fields as a probe of physics .",
    "our exploration work was primarily numerical .",
    "a precise analytic relation between the value of the magnetic field and the nature of the dispersion of the peaks would be a valuable result .",
    "however , there is an apparent obstruction to doing the obvious generalization of the analysis of ref.@xcite that exploits the presence of the ads@xmath140 region .",
    "there , an expansion about the @xmath141 point , where the quasiparticle peak appears , representing a fermi surface with fermi energy @xmath131 equal to the @xmath18 chemical potential @xmath57 .",
    "things are different in our case . while it is trivial to show that there is again an ads@xmath140 region near the horizon of the dyon ( rather nicely , the electric field is entirely in the ads@xmath142 and the magnetic field is entirely threading the @xmath143 ) , this is not enough . in the presence of magnetic field , the energy of the system gets lifted .",
    "the lowest available level at which we find a quasiparticle peak , for a given @xmath2 has fermi energy @xmath131 greater than the @xmath18 chemical potential @xmath57 , and so occurs away from the @xmath144 point that was the focus of refs.@xcite .",
    "there is no good analytical guide ( so far ) as to where in @xmath129 the peaks will arise , and so we search for them numerically",
    ". an analytical characterization of exactly how the presence of @xmath2 affects the dispersion relation will have to await future work .",
    "we would like to thank arnab kundu and mohammad edalati for conversations that led to this project .",
