    "due to recent progress in the field of ultracold gases , spinor bose - einstein condensates with various types of spin - orbit coupling can now be realized experimentally @xcite by using spatially varying laser fields to couple internal pseudo - spin degrees of freedom to the momentum .",

    "of particular interest have been two - component bosons with isotropic rashba - type @xcite spin - orbit coupling , where in the absence of interactions the energy dispersion assumes a minimum on a circle in momentum space @xcite .",
    "if the bosons do not condense , such a surface in momentum space can be called a bose surface , in analogy with the fermi surface of an electronic system @xcite .",
    "of course , bosons do not obey the pauli exclusion principle , so that the bose surface can not be the boundary between occupied and unoccupied states ; however , the bose surface defines the location of the low - energy excitations in the system , similar to the fermi surface of an electronic system .",
    "the fact that bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in bose systems where the dispersion has degenerate minima on a surface in momentum space differs qualitatively from conventional bec has been pointed out a long time ago by yukalov  @xcite .",

    "which phase is realized experimentally depends on the specific properties of the interaction . at this point",
    "a generally accepted agreement on the nature of the ground state in the spinor bose gas with rashba - type spin - orbit coupling has not been reached .",
    "phase transitions in systems whose fluctuation spectrum exhibits minima on a surface in momentum space form their own universality class , the so - called brazovskii universality class @xcite ; for example , the critical behavior in cholesteric liquid crystals belongs to this class @xcite .",
    "because scaling transformations and mode elimination in renormalization group calculations should be defined relative to the low - energy manifold , the classification of interaction vertices in systems belonging to the brazovskii universality class is different from the corresponding classification in systems where the low - energy manifold consists of a single point ; in particular , all two - body scattering processes where the momenta of the incoming and the outgoing particles lie on the low - energy manifold are marginal , so that in renormalization group calculations one should keep track of infinitely many marginal couplings . note",
