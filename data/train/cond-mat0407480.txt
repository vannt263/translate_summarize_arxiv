    "semiflexible polymers are macromolecules with a bending stiffness intermediate between that of an absolutely flexible ( gaussian ) chain and a rigid rod .",
    "a measure of the directedness of a polymer is its persistence length , which is proportional to the bending stiffness .",
    "semiflexible polymers have a presistence length of the order of the total contour length .",
    "they have been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental study in recent years primarily because many biologically important macromolecules fall in this class .",
    "the structural elements of the cytoskeleton ( actin filaments , microtubules , intermediate filaments ) and double - helix dna exhibit elastic behavior dominated by their bending stiffness @xcite .",
    "single - molecule experiments have allowed the study of the influence of external forces or force fields on the conformational properties of semiflexible polymers@xcite .",
    "their theoretical study is considerably more challenging compared to that of flexible chains and one of the main reasons is the lack of scaling properties except for limiting cases ( e.g. , weakly bending polymers ) . in the worm - like chain model , pulling a semiflexible polymer at its ends is formally analogous to the stark effect of a quantum rotator @xcite .",
    "this analogy has led to semi - analytical solutions of the force - extension problem .",
    "the response to a force field is even more complicated as the quantum analogy involves a non - local ( in imaginary time ) interaction .",
    "further complications arise from intramolecular interactions between different polymer segments which may become important in realistic experimental situations where a polymer is subject to a hydrodynamic flow or it is charged and placed in an electric field .",
    "marko and siggia @xcite have derived an approximate analytical field - extension relation for a semiflexible polymer which has one end fixed and is free to rotate about it .",
    "their result for strong fields appears to be in good agreement with an experiment done with dna in an external electric field @xcite .",
    "@xcite have calculated conformational properties of a grafted semiflexible polymer in a uniform force field in two dimensions using recursion relations in the weakly bending approximation which is valid at strong fields and/or large persistence lengths .",
    "we should mention that the standard gaussian polymer model is inadequate to describe stretching in strong fields because it is infinitely extensible @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the worm - like chain is characterized by a fixed total contour length constraint and this problem is avoided .    charged polymers with two types of charge ( positive and negative ) along their backbone are called polyampholytes .",
    "they have attracted a lot of attention because of their inherent theoretical interest and their relevance to the protein folding problem @xcite .",
    "there have been studies of their response to an electric field @xcite but most of the previous works deal with their conformational properties due to the intramolecular interactions in the absence of an external field .",
    "they all consider charge distributions on backbones described as flexible or freely - jointed chains and do not take into account the possibility of an internal bending stiffness .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the linear response of a grafted worm - like chain to a uniform electric field for arbitrary bending stiffness and field orientation . in sec .",

    "the worm - like chain is a fluctuating , continuous , locally inextensible line with a fixed total contour length @xmath0 . in the absence of any external force ,",
    "its effective free energy functional depends only on the bending ( curvature ) and is given by @xmath1= \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\int_0^l ds \\big [ \\frac{\\partial { \\bf t}(s)}{\\partial s } \\big ] ^2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the unit tangent vector of the curve @xmath3 at arc length @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the bending stiffness @xcite .",

    "this simple model neglects the intramolecular interaction between different segments of the same polymer and also the steric self - avoidance .",
    "the latter is expected to be negligible for @xmath14 . for polymers with a large aspect ratio , like double - helix dna or f - actin ,",
    "self - avoidance effects become important only for @xmath15 .    if @xmath16 is the angle between the tangent vector @xmath17 and the field @xmath10 , we can write @xmath18 the orientational probability distribution of a worm - like chain having a conformation with a tangent vector @xmath19 at one end and a tangent vector @xmath20 at the other is given by a path integral which is formally analogous to the density matrix element , in the angle representation , of a quantum rigid rotator @xcite",

    "indeed , the response of a worm - like or a freely - jointed chain to a strong field has different scaling behavior and is free from this pathology as it is shown in refs .",
