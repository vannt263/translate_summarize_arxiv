    "it is widely accepted that neutron stars ( nss ) are born with fast rotating angular velocities . due to magnetic torques ,",
    "however , the ns periods could well be spun down .",
    "this spin - down causes a reduction in the centrifuge force and , consequently , the central energy density of the nss increases . those stars , born with densities close to that of the quark deconfinement , may undergo a phase transition forming a strange quark matter core .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that it is not a common sense that such a transition really takes place .    as a consequence of such a putative phase transition",
    ", the stars could suffer a collapse which could excite mechanical oscillations .",
    "the great amount of energy generated in this process , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , could be dissipated , at least partially , in the form of gravitational waves ( gws ) , which are studied in the present work .",
    "we adopted in the present paper the history of star formation derived by springel & hernquist @xcite , who employed hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation in a @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) cosmology .",
    "these authors study the history of cosmic star formation from the  dark ages \" , at redshift @xmath6 , to the present .",
    "besides the reliable history of star formation by springel & hernquist , we consider the role of the parameters @xmath7 , which gives the fraction of the progenitor mass which forms the remnant nss .",
    "we consider that the remnant mass is given as a function of the progenitor mass , namely @xmath8 .",
    "later on we justify why @xmath9 is written in this way . recall that a given initial mass function ( imf ) refers to the distribution function of the stellar progenitor mass , and also to the masses of the remnant compact objects left as a result of the stellar evolution .    in the present study",
    "we have adopted a stellar generation with a salpeter imf , which is consistent with springel & hernquist , since they show that population ii stars could have been formed at high redshift too .",
    "we then discuss briefly what conclusions would be drawn whether ( or not ) the stochastic background studied here is detected by gw observatories such as ligo and virgo .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with the ns eoss adopted in our study ; in section 3 we consider the imf and the ns masses ; section 4 deals with the gw production ; in section 5 we present the numerical results and discussions ; section 6 the detectability of the background of gws are considered and finally in section 7 we present the conclusions .",
    "we consider in the present study a particular model developed by taurines et al @xcite for a new class of parameterized field - theoretical model described by a lagrangian density , where the whole baryon octet is coupled to scalar and vector fields through parameterized coupling constants .",
    "the free lepton fields contributes to the electrical equilibrium in the ns matter .    using a parametrization for the baryon - meson coupling constants ,",
    "this model describes a wide range of ns parameters , such as a maximum mass ranging from ( very low values ) @xmath10 up to @xmath11 , and the corresponding radii that vary in the range of @xmath12 .",
    "each pair in the mass - radius relation is associated with a different parametrization of the eos ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "of course , each value of such parametrization represents different values of nuclear matter properties .",
    "another scenario to be discussed concerns the strange quark star .",
    "the model used in this analysis is the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "the effects of pressure difference in the interior and exterior regions of the bag are summarized in the bag constant .",
    "once the transition to quark - gluon matter occurs , the weak interaction processes for the quarks u , d and s @xmath13 and @xmath14 will take place , and a rapid transition occurs with a consequent gravitational micro - collapse . as a result , a huge amount of energy is dissipated , some in the form of gws produced by quasi - normal modes excitation .",
    "the calculation of the gw background from ns phase transition requires the knowledge of the distribution function of stellar masses , the so called stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath15 . here",
    "the salpeter imf is adopted , namely    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the normalization constant and @xmath18 ( our fiducial value ) .",
    "the normalization of the imf is obtained through the relation    @xmath19    where we consider @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that concerning the star formation at high redshift , the imf could be biased toward high - mass stars , when compared to the solar neighborhood imf , as a result of the absence of metals @xcite .    on the other hand , in the study by springel and hernquist , besides a high - mass star formation , it is shown that the population ii stars , whose imf could well be of the salpeter s type , could start forming around redshift 20 or higher .    in the present study",
    "we consider this population ii studied by these authors .",
    "then , for the standard imf , the mass fraction of nss produced as remnants of the stellar evolution is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the minimum stellar mass capable of producing a ns at the end of its life , and @xmath24 is the mass of the remnant ns .",
    "stellar evolution calculations show that the minimal progenitor mass to form nss is @xmath25 , while the maximum progenitor mass is @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we do not intend to discuss in the present paper stellar evolution scenarios related to the formation of nss .",
    "many works can be found in the literature concerning the study of stellar evolution , supernova and ns formation @xcite .",
    "however , we need to formulate a relation between the progenitor star mass @xmath27 and the remnant ns mass @xmath28 . for the remnant , @xmath28 ,",
    "we take    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants ; the first one is dimensionless and the second one is given in solar masses .",
    "as the results for stellar evolution are not yet fully determined , we studied this parametrization in three different scenarios for the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 which would represent the distribution of ns mass as function of the progenitor mass ( see table 1 and the following sections ) .",
    "for example , considering nss formed from progenitors with @xmath32 we would have remnants with masses @xmath33 1.375@xmath34 , 1.5@xmath34 and 2.7@xmath34 .",
    "these parameters describe sharper or softer distribution of ns masses around the standard value of mass @xmath35 .",
    "note that we are considering in the end that @xmath24 is independent of the redshift .",
    ".the values of @xmath7 which determines the fraction of the ns remant . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     as shown in table 3 , the signal - to - noise ratio for all models studied is lower than one , even for an advanced ligo .",
    "therefore , contrary to the claim of @xcite such a putative gw background would hardly be detected .",
    "note that the signal - to - noise ratio , for given imf , @xmath36 , and integration time , depends on @xmath37 and @xmath38 as follows @xmath39    and it also depends on the sfr density in a more complicated way , namely , through an integral involving the redshift @xmath40 .",
    "the higher the star formation rate , the higher the signal - to noise ratio will be .    just a matter of comparision , even considering models with @xmath41 , a signal - to - noise ratio significantly greater than one , for the advanced ligo , would be possible either the sfr density would be much greater than that by springel & hernquist , or the energy generated in the phase transition were almost completely channeled to excite the f- mode .",
    "obviously , an optimist combination of the sfr density and the energy channeled to the f - mode would also render the same .",
    "we present here a study concerning the generation of gws produced from a cosmological population of nss .",
    "these stars may undergo a phase transition if born close to the transition density , suffering a micro - collapse and exciting quasi - normal modes .",
    "we show that a detectable background is possible only if the sfr density is much greater than that predicted by springel & hernquist or if the energy generated in the phase transition is almost completely channeled to excite the f- mode .",
    "obviously , a too optimistic combination of these two possibilities could do the same ."
