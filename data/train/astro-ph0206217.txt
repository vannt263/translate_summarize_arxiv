    "recent observations of high redshift quasars @xcite offer a unique probe of the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) shortly after the epoch of reionization .",
    "similar future observations will increase the amount of observational data multi - fold and will provide critical constraints on the theories of galaxy formation .",
    "however , if we want to go beyond the epoch of reionization and to study the pre - overlap stage during which ionized  regions expand into still neutral low density gas , we need to use different bands of electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "next generation space telescope ( ngst ) will provide valuable clues on the earliest episodes of galaxy formation from infra - red observations , although a relationship between the first galaxies and the properties of the igm at high redshifts will not necessarily be easy to determine from such observations .",
    "radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen might be capable of measuring the pre - reionization signal @xcite , although such a measurement will be at the very edge of the capability of the next generation radio instruments such as low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "another possible channel to probe the pre - overlap stage of reionization is studying secondary cmb anisotropies @xcite .",
    "while such a measurement is also in the future , observations of the secondary cmb anisotropies can provide constraints on the physical conditions in the igm that are not accessible by other means .",
    "in fact , because cmb anisotropies are sensitive to the total thompson optical depth , they can probe low levels of ionization in the mostly neutral gas - which can not be done by radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm line .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed recently in which the universe undergoes a protracted episode of incomplete ionization prior to full reionization , either due to early supernova - driven winds @xcite or ionizations by energetic x - rays @xcite .",
    "this kind of `` smoldering '' reionization ( which results in a partial reduction in the neutral hydrogen fraction ) will be virtually impossible to detect with radio observations .",
    "such a signature also can not be detected by measuring just the spectrum of the fluctuations , because , as was shown in gnedin & jaffe , the power spectrum of secondary anisotropies is only weakly dependent on the redshift of reionization .",
    "however , gnedin & jaffe noticed that the fluctuations themselves were highly non - gaussian . in this paper",
    "we show how tests of the non - gaussianity of the secondary cmb anisotropies can detect the signature of an epoch of `` smoldering reionization '' .",
    "the physical reason behind such a possibility is simple : the earlier the epoch of `` smoldering reionization '' begins , the more nonlinear the objects that are responsible for the production of ionizing photons should be , and , therefore , the more non - gaussian the secondary cmb anisotropies will be . and it does not matter for this test what the sources of ionizations really are , only that they form early and , therefore , highly nonlinear at early times , when the linear fluctuations are smaller .",
    "a big advantage of a morphological approach is that it is virtually independent of assumptions about the underlying cosmological model .",
    "for example , the redshifted 21 cm emission and absorption will depend on the rate at which ionization front expand into the low density igm , gobbling up the neutral gas on the way . and",
    "because secondary cmb anisotropies are dominated by nonlinear structures on small scales @xcite , they are insensitive to the specific details of how ionization fronts expand .",
    "in this paper we use the synthetic maps of the secondary cmb anisotropies from gnedin & jaffe .",
    "these maps were obtained from a numerical simulation of cosmological reionization , published in gnedin .",
    "the simulation included all the physical ingredients required to study the process of reionization , including the 3d radiative transfer .",
    "it assumed a currently fashionable cdm+@xmath8 cosmological model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 in a comoving box with the size of @xmath15 .",
    "however , for the purpose of this paper the specific details about a cosmological model are unimportant .",
    "for the considered cosmology the angular size of a fixed comoving length is almost independent of redshift for @xmath16 .",
    "for example , our @xmath15 box subtends 2.7 arcmin at @xmath17 , 2.2 arcmin at @xmath18 , and 1.9 arcmin at @xmath4 .",
    "due to computational limitations , our highest resolution images include @xmath19 pixels .",
    "thus , we are able to access multipoles from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .    because our goal is to measure the degree of the non - gaussianity of the cmb maps , we need an appropriate tool for such a task .",
    "one of the most powerful mathematical tools to study different morphologies are minkowski functionals .",
    "morphology , i.e.  geometry and topology , of a random field can be quantified by a set of measures know as minkowski functionals @xcite .",
    "although being known in mathematics since the beginning of 20th century , they were brought into cosmology not long ago by mecke , buchert & wagner despite occasional partial rediscoveries ( gott 1990 ) . in the simplest form of a connected region",
    "represent three numbers characterizing the shape of a region : the area @xmath22 , perimeter @xmath23 , and genus @xmath24 , which can be defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of holes in the region .",
    "are additive , therefore they have precise meaning for any set of the regions , and can be easily computed if they are known for each region in the set . of the excursion set",
    "often called the global are particularly popular in cosmology @xcite .",
    "global of the two - dimensional gaussian field is known analytically @xcite @xmath27 , \\cr p(u)&=&\\frac{1}{2r}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right),\\cr g(u)&=&\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{3}{2 } } \\frac{1}{r^2}u   \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right ) , \\label{gmf_g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the scale of the field ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the rms of the field and its first derivatives ( in statistically isotropic fields both derivatives @xmath31 and @xmath32 have equal rms ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath33 . here @xmath34 is the fraction of the total area in the regions of the excursion set",
    ", @xmath35 is the total length of the contour or total perimeter per characteristic area @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the ( number of regions ) - ( number of holes ) per @xmath36 .",
    "the popularity of the global is probably related to the existence of the analytic formulae ( eq .  [ gmf_g ] ) and computational easiness .",
    "computing global is usually done simply by identifying the pixels satisfying the threshold condition and applying the crofton formulae @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this simple technique is quite crude resulting in nonconvergence of the contour length . for large maps",
    "a statistical correction can be applied @xcite , however its effects in finite size maps is not quantified .",
    "the least effect would be a significant growth of noise .",
    "we use a different technique which identifies every region in the excursion set and computes its area , perimeter and genus from the contour points obtained by the interpolation between pixels .",
    "one can find the details of the technique in @xcite .",
    "in addition to significant increase of the accuracy the method allows to use additional information about individual regions of the excursion set . in this study along with global we also use the number of regions ( or - using the jargon of the cluster analysis - number of clusters @xmath0 ) and the of the largest area region ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) labeled as percolating cluster since it plays a crucial role in identifying the percolation transition .",
    "the of the percolating cluster of gaussian fields are not not known in analytic form but can be easily computed ( see shandarin ) .",
    "we parameterize the measurements by the total area in the excursion set @xmath40 measured in units of the total area of the map .",
    "the advantages of this parameterization are described in shandarin .",
    "since minkowski functionals depend on the power spectrum ( @xmath41 and @xmath29 are obviously determined by the power spectrum ) of the statistical field , we need to separate this dependence from the dependence on the non - gaussian statistics . for this purpose for each simulated field of cmb anisotropies",
    "we produce 100 gaussian realizations with exactly the same power spectrum , and analyze these gaussian realization in exactly the same manner as the simulated field .",
    "this also reduces the discreteness and boundary effects .",
    "we can then compare minkowski functionals for the simulated image and for the gaussian realizations in order to measure the non - gaussian signal .",
    "an example of such a comparison for all 6 functionals considered here is given in figure [ figmf ] .",
    "the behavior of all functionals is typical for all grids .",
    "plotting the deviation from the median of 100 gaussian realizations better illustrates the type of non - gaussianity in the @xmath42 fields ( figure [ figmf512 ] ) .",
    "generally there are fewer regions @xmath0 and the global perimeter @xmath1 is shorter than in the corresponding gaussian fields .",
    "the global genus @xmath43 at very small @xmath40 ( for rare peaks ) is close to @xmath0 , since rare peaks have no holes .",
    "however , at the other extreme it is significantly affected by the presence of holes and is different from the gaussian genus .",
    "the area of the percolating region does not differ much from the gaussian fields but the perimeter of the percolating region generally somewhat shorter .",
    "the genus of the percolating region @xmath39 shows more significant deviation from the gaussian field indicating that the number of holes in the largest region is smaller than in the gaussian case . comparing it with the corresponding part of the global genus ( at @xmath44 )",
    "one can see the influence of small regions : they are present in @xmath43 but omitted in @xmath39 .",
    "one can notice that the number of clusters @xmath0 , the isocontour perimeter @xmath1 and the genus @xmath39 show the strongest deviations from the gaussian distribution .",
    "the global perimeter @xmath1 is measured in the grid units and then normalized to one site .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we will focus on @xmath39 and @xmath1 functionals for brevity .",
    "the task of quantifying the degree of deviation of the simulation from the gaussian distribution is a formidable one and is generally an unsolved mathematical problem .",
    "specifically , we would like to know how much gaussian or non - gaussian are the black curves in fig .",
    "[ figmf ] .",
    "because we can not solve this problem in a general case , we have designed the following simple approach that allows us to measure the degree of non - gaussianity in some cases and identify cases where this can not be done .",
    "we start by assuming that we can treat each curve @xmath45 in the interval @xmath46 as a collection of random variables @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a subdivision of the interval @xmath49 $ ] ( it does not have to be uniform ) .",
    "we then treat @xmath50 from gaussian realizations as gaussian random variables ( this is the main assumption ) , so that the joined probability for all @xmath50 for a given curve @xmath45 is @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the mean for @xmath50 and @xmath53 is the correlation function . both @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "can be computed directly from 100 gaussian realizations .",
    "then for a given collection of @xmath56 from the simulated map we can compute the `` effective '' chi - square @xmath57 the problem with this approach is that often @xmath55 is ill - defined if the curves are smooth and neighbouring points @xmath50 and @xmath58 are highly correlated . in order to avoid small eigenvalues in matrix @xmath55 we use the singular value decomposition to expand the correlation matrix as @xmath59 where @xmath60 are eigenvalues of @xmath55 and matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 are orthonormal .",
    "we can then rewrite the effective chi - square ( [ ecsdef ] ) as a sum over inverse eigenvalues , @xmath63 let us now consider not the full sum but a partial sum , where we assume that @xmath60 are sorted in the descending order ( they are all positive since the correlation matrix is always positive definite ) , @xmath64 the expression @xmath65 as a function of @xmath66 reaches a maximum at some value of @xmath67 . if we interpret @xmath68 as chi - square per degree of freedom @xmath66 , then @xmath67 gives us the number of degrees of freedom present in the simulated curve @xmath56 , and we choose to truncate the sum ( [ ecsprt ] ) at this value of @xmath66 - thus , discarding small @xmath60 which makes the inverse correlation matrix ill - defined .    because @xmath69 is not real chi - square",
    ", we can not use standard tables to compute the confidence level on our simulated curve .",
    "instead , we compute @xmath69 for 100 gaussian curves @xmath50 and compare the cumulative distribution @xmath70 for 100 gaussian realization with the value @xmath71 for the simulation .",
    "if @xmath71 falls within the range of values that gaussian realizations span , we can directly estimate the probability that the simulation is non - gaussian by counting how many gaussian realizations have @xmath69 greater then @xmath71 .",
    "however , because we only have 100 gaussian realization , we can not measure probabilities better than 1% in this way .",
    "so , if @xmath71 does not lie within the range spanned by gaussian realizations , we assume that @xmath69 for gaussian realizations indeed obey the chi - square distribution and compute the confidence level on @xmath71 from that assumption .",
    "we also compare the distribution of @xmath69 with the true chi - square distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test , and when this test fails our assumption becomes invalid . in that case",
    "we can only say that the simulation is non - gaussian at better than 99% confidence level .",
    "figure [ figre ] shows the effect of angular resolution of the measurement of the minkowski functionals . for brevity ,",
    "we only show the genus of the percolating region as a function of total area of the excursion set for four values of angular resolution ( which also implies different pixel sizes because the image size is fixed to 2.2 arcmin ) . in order to provide a better illustration",
    "we plot the deviation of the genus from the median value obtained from 100 gaussian realizations .",
    "as one can see , higher resolution gives progressively more non - gaussian signal .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ figgg ] , which shows the probability that the signal is gaussian as a function of the image size .",
    "the number of clusters statistic @xmath0 and global perimeter @xmath1 show similar trends .",
    "this trend is easy to understand : as the resolution increases , we probe progressively smaller spatial scales that are more non - linear - and , thus , more non - gaussian - than larger scales .",
    "a similar trend is observed when we change the redshift of reionization ( we follow the specific procedure described in gnedin & jaffe ) .",
    "the redshift of reionization is defined as the moment at which the rate of change of the mean free path to ionizing radiation peaks .",
    "it roughly corresponds to the moment when the volume weighted mean fraction of neutral hydrogen is about 10% .",
    "figure [ figep ] shows the genus and perimeter , but other minkowski functionals follow a similar trend . in this figure",
    "we again show the deviations from the median .",
    "( _ a _ ) ( _ b _ )    for this result to hold , however , it does not matter whether the universe is reionized completely or the neutral fraction remains of the order of 10% or so .",
    "after all , the cmb anisotropies are sensitive to the total optical depth .",
    "so , if the mean neutral fraction drops to 10% at , say , @xmath72 , and the complete reionization ( during which the neutral fraction drops to @xmath73 ) takes place at @xmath74 , our results for @xmath4 would apply , whereas neither radio observations ( because the neutral fraction is only 10% ) nor optical / ir observations ( because the neutral fraction is still 10% ) will be able to obtain any information about the `` smoldering reionization '' period from @xmath72 to @xmath74 .    real observations are almost always suffer from noise . in order to test the robustness of the morphological statistic used here , we added gaussian noise to the maps of the model with the reionization epoch at @xmath75 .",
    "besides the model without noise we analyzed the models with the signal to noise ratios @xmath76 .",
    "we found that increasing noise from zero to about @xmath77 the deviations of the minkowski functionals from the median of the gaussian ensemble steadily change from that shown in fig.[figmf512 ] to fig.[figmf512ns05 ] .",
    "the further decrease of the signal to noise ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath78 eventually makes the non - gaussian signal undetectable as illustrated by fig.[figmf512noise ] .",
    "quantitatively the probabilities of the number of regions @xmath0 shown in fig.[figmf512noise ] to be gaussian are much less than 1% for @xmath79 and @xmath80 and is about 5% for @xmath78 .",
    "we remind that making comparison with only one hundred gaussian fields one can not reliably estimate this probability much better then 1% .",
    "this conclusion is also rather insensitive to the precise value of the neutral fraction during the `` smoldering '' phase",
    ". really , for our values for the cosmological parameters , the thompson optical depth accumulated from the redshift interval from @xmath81 to @xmath82 is @xmath83 @xmath84.\\ ] ] thus , if we assume that the universe is fully reionized at @xmath2 , the interval from @xmath2 to @xmath85 produces @xmath86 .",
    "a period of `` smoldering '' reionization from @xmath4 to @xmath2 with the average free electron fraction @xmath87 would give another contribution to the thompson optical depth of @xmath88 .",
    "for example a model in which the universe reionizes fully at @xmath75 is very similar to the model which reionizes fully at @xmath2 but has a period of `` smoldering reionization '' from @xmath4 to @xmath2 with @xmath89 .",
    "thus , until @xmath87 drops below about @xmath90 , it will be possible to detect the period of `` smoldering '' reionization . in that case , however , radio observations will likely be capable of tracing the neutral hydrogen abundance .    of course",
    ", if the period of `` smoldering '' reionization is shorter , the sensitivity to the average free electron fraction will be respectively weaker .",
    "however , for the scenario proposed in venkatesan et al .  , the effect is indeed measurable .",
    "we showed how the morphological analysis of the maps of the secondary cmb anisotropies on sub - arcminute angular scales can detect an extended period of `` smoldering '' reionization , during which the universe remains partially ionized .",
    "if the neutral hydrogen fraction during such a period is below about 50% but still well above @xmath91 , such a period will be detectable neither by radio observations of the redshifted 21 cm line nor by ir observations of the lyman - alpha forest . in that case",
    "morphology of the cmb anisotropies offers the best chance to probe the igm at early times .",
    "we computed each of six parameters as a function of the fractional area of the excursion set , @xmath40 : 1 ) the number of regions in the excursion set , @xmath0 , 2 ) total perimeter in the excursion set , @xmath1 , 3 ) genus of the excursion set defined as the number of regions minus the number of holes , @xmath43 , 4 ) area of the largest ( i.e. percolating ) region , @xmath92 , 5 ) perimeter of the largest region , @xmath93 , and 6 ) the genus of the largest region , @xmath39 .",
    "three parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath1 and @xmath43 ) are known as the global minkowski functionals of the excursion set , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath39 are the minkowski functionals of largest ( by area ) region .",
    "we found @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath39 are particularly sensitive to the non - gaussianity in @xmath42 maps due to secondary reionization , they are also the most robust to effects of noise . @xmath92 and @xmath93 are not sensitive to this type of non - gaussianity , @xmath43 is significantly less sensitive then @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath39 .",
    "using @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath39 one can detect the non - gaussianity in the cmb maps with @xmath7 at the significance level of better than 99% .",
    "morphological analysis of the shapes of individual regions in the excursion set provides considerably more information about non - gaussianity of the maps and potentially may improve the current result both in terms of the resolution of the maps and signal to noise ratio .",
    "we reserve this study for the future work .",
