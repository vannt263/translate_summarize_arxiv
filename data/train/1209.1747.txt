    "the correlation femtoscopy , or intensity interferometry method , is the direct tool to measure the spatial and temporal scales of extremely small and short - lived systems created in particle and nuclear collisions with accuracy of @xmath2 m and @xmath3 sec , respectively .",
    "the method @xcite , is grounded on the bose - einstein ( be ) or fermi - dirac ( fd ) symmetric properties of the quantum states .",
    "it has a deep analogy with the intensity interferometry telescope that was proposed by hanbury brown and twiss for measurements of angular sizes of remote stars @xcite . in distinction on standard",
    "telescopic and microscopic techniques based on the registration of intensities of light or particles , e.g. , electrons , coming from ( or through ) the object , this method deals with the correlation between intensities of the source radiation registered by two ( many ) spatially separated parts of devices , such as telescopes , reflectors , particle detectors , etc .",
    "in fact , it measures the correlations between numbers of emitted identical particles detected in separated parts of the detector .",
    "the femtoscopic space - time structure of the systems is typically represented in terms of the interferometry radii .",
    "they are result of the gaussian fit of the correlation function defined as a ratio of the two- ( identical ) particle spectra to the product of the single - particle ones . in the pioneer papers @xcite the measured interferometry radii",
    "were interpreted as the geometrical sizes of the systems . later on it",
    "was found @xcite that for typical systems formed in experiments with heavy ions , the above geometrical interpretation needs to be generalized .",
    "the treatment of the interferometry radii as the homogeneity lengths @xcite in the systems and the crucial suggestion for femtoscopy scanning of the source radiation in different momentum bins bring the possibility to analyze different parts of the source and explain the behavior of the interferometry radii .",
    "in addition , the practical method how to use the final state interactions ( fsi ) and effects of long - lived resonances to extract the be correlations in relatively large systems created in heavy ion collisions has been proposed @xcite .    the other challenge , which is still actual , concerns the femtoscopy analysis of relatively small systems created in particle interactions such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where the observed femtoscopic scales are approximately 1 fm or smaller @xcite . typically , the suppression of the correlation function is fairly large in these processes . here",
    "we will analyze the femtoscopy of such small systems accounting for the uncertainty principle , coherence of the radiation from spatially very closely set emitters and non - femtoscopic ( non be , fd and fsi ) correlations .",
    "the latter appear due to the energy - momentum conservation law and incoherent contributions to the two- and single - particle spectra induced by particle clusterization in momentum space and fluctuations of initial conditions of the collision processes .",
    "the detailed analysis of these theoretical problems can help to provide the correct femtoscopy study of the small systems .",
    "the intensity interferometry method for the measurement of the stars angular sizes was proposed and realized first by hanbury brown and twiss @xcite at the end of the 1950s .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation from the star is the mixture of different , almost monochromatic wave trains , which are mutually incoherent at the moment of radiation . to see the principal aspects ,",
    "let us consider the emission from the different sites of a radiating object .",
    "if the stellar object is close to the observer , like our sun , then one can easily select , say , the opposite sites ( edges ) of it . if the two telescopes are directed to those different sites and one measures the correlations between photon numbers coming to each of the two telescopes , then the waves from different sites of the source do not mix in the telescopes , and the correlations between them are absent  the signals coming to the two telescope reflectors are mutually incoherent .",
    "if , however , the stellar object  let us consider now the double star system  is very remote , so that it is impossible to select only one of the two stars by a telescope , the light from both stars will come to each of the two reflectors and become mutually ( partially ) coherent . for simplicity",
    "let us imagine that at some moment in time the telescopes register only one wave train from each star , and both these trains are equally polarized and follow each other continuously .",
    "_ ipso facto _ we ignore the real problems of the intensity interferometry method  how to extract the signal from the noise",
    " but preserve the principal point of this method",
    ".      one can decompose the electric field strength into positive and negative frequency parts , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the ideal photon counter reacts just to the product @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "far from the stellar object the light is described well by the plane waves , so that    @xmath7    the complex amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath9 have stochastic independent phases : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which are roughly constants during coherence time @xmath12 of the wave train , e.g. , @xmath13 sec , so that being averaged over a period of time @xmath14 , the amplitudes and their product become zero : @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the intensity of light that is proportional to the number of photons registered by the telescope / reflector and photo - multipliers at point @xmath18 is    @xmath19    where we supposed that @xmath20 are almost independent on @xmath21 .",
    "the statistically averaged intensity registered by one of the telescopes contains the information only about the ( averaged ) squared modulus of the amplitudes .",
    "however , the correlation of intensities @xmath22 , defined as the ratio of the averaged product of intensities registered at the two space - time points @xmath23 and @xmath24 to the product of averaged intensities registered at these points , depends already on the differences of momenta and energies of the light quanta .",
    "to simplify notation , we put @xmath25 and get @xmath26\\label{intcorr}\\\\ & \\approx & 1+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos [ \\theta \\left| \\mathbf{k}\\right|d+((x_{l1}-x_{l2})/c - t_1+t_2)(\\omega_1-\\omega_2)],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one took into account that @xmath27 , etc . here",
    "the @xmath28 is the angular size of the double star system with `` transverse '' distance @xmath29 between stars in the plane perpendicular to the direction to the system , @xmath30 is the distance to the system , @xmath31 is the `` transverse '' distance between two telescopes , @xmath32 is the mean detected wave number , @xmath33 is the `` longitudinal '' , directed to the system , coordinate of the _ i_-telescope and @xmath34 is the signal delay between points @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is worth noting that the time resolution @xmath37 in the method has to be smaller than the coherence time , @xmath38 , in order to provide correlation measurement of photon numbers during the mutual coherence time @xmath12 of the electromagnetic waves in points @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for a stationary process",
    "the averaging over a large period of time @xmath39 plays the role of the averaging over the ensemble of events with duration time @xmath12 . also note that the condition of the validity of formula ( [ intcorr ] ) is @xmath40 otherwise , @xmath41 , and the correlations disappear , @xmath42 , because of the mutual incoherence of waves coming to the two telescopes .",
    "the formula ( [ intcorr ] ) demonstrates the principle of measurement the differences in momenta ( and energies ) of photons radiated by remote stars by measuring the correlation function depending on distances between telescopes / reflectors and time delay .",
    "in fact , the momentum difference in the transverse plane is connected with the angular size of a stellar object . as for the difference in the energy of the photons , it is possible , in principle , to measure it with the restriction given by eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , and this difference would be associated with different temperatures of the two stars , if such a situation could take place .",
    "however , there is no direct connection of the difference in the energy of radiated photons with the time and space scales of the stellar system , and , therefore , only the angular size of this object can be extracted in this way .",
    "the latter is the basic application of the intensity interferometry telescope , and the method was used to measure the angular sizes of single remote stars . at the whole stellar disk , and formula ( [ intcorr ] ) is modified at @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44}\\stackrel{n\\rightarrow \\infty}{\\rightarrow}(\\frac{2j_1(\\theta|{\\bf k}|d)}{\\theta|{\\bf k}|d})^2 $ ] .",
    "determining the distance corresponding to the first zero of the correlation function in this representation hanbury brown and twiss have measured the angular size of sirius and some other stars . ]    despite the classical description of the hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) method , the detailed analysis of the measurements accounting for the principle of photon registration pointed to the quantum nature of the effect @xcite .",
    "the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions of the electromagnetic waves has been established through the formalism of coherent states @xcite .",
    "appealing to the quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields , one can say that the method of the measurement of the star angular size is based on the positive correlations between numbers of photons registered in two close _ space - time _ points because of bose - einstein statistics for these quanta .",
    "if a double star system is so far from the detectors that the latter can register only a few photons per @xmath37 , then one has to use the amplitudes of registration at points @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the two photons emitted with mutually random phases from the two stars @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then taking the ratio of the averaged modulus squared of symmetric ( over photons permutation ) two - photon amplitude @xmath51 to the product of the averaged single - photon amplitudes one can get again the correlation structure ( [ intcorr ] ) . note that describing a registration of the two neutrinos from the star , one should use the antisymmetrized amplitude @xmath52 .",
    "in particle physics the positive correlations between numbers of identical pions with close momenta emitted from an interaction region in proton - antiproton annihilations were found in 1960 by goldhaber _",
    "( gglp effect ) @xcite .",
    "it was understood that the nature of the effect lies in quantum statistics for identical particles demanding the symmetrization of bosonic wave function .",
    "later on , based on this fundamental principle , kopylov and podgoretsky @xcite developed the method of the pion interferometry microscope , or correlation femtoscopy / interferometry .",
    "they found an analogy between the correlation interferometry and hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) stellar intensity interferometry @xcite .",
    "as one can see below , the basic mathematical structure of the two methods can be presented in identical form . however , at the hbt measurements , the interference of intensities / photon numbers happen near the detector ( telescope pair ) , where the correlations form , while in the femtoscopy the quantum statistical ( qs ) correlations arise in the emitting object .",
    "the hbt is based on the analysis of particle correlations as they depend on the space - time separation of the telescopes / reflectors , while the correlation interferometry deals with dependence of the correlations on the particles momenta differences .",
    "correspondingly , the measurands are different .",
    "the hbt method measures differences of momenta and energies of photons radiated by stellar objects , and the only angular sizes associated with observed momenta difference , but not spatiotemporal scales can be extracted . in contrast , the correlation femtoscopy measures the space and time separation of the emission points , and so extracts all the sizes and three - dimensional geometrical shape of the source , as well as a duration of the emission . in this sense the term `` hbt radii '' that one often uses to present the femtoscopy measurements is not quite adequate , as is stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the basic ideas of the correlation femtoscopy are described in many publications , e.g. , ref .",
    "we reproduce them here with some important remarks .",

    "( [ w(p1p2 ) ] ) with result ( [ intcorr ] ) , related to the interferometry telescope , one can see that they differ from each other by a factor of @xmath68 before the cosine .",
    "the attentive reader can notice the difference between the two cases .",
    "in the case of emission from a double star system the correlation of intensities accounts for all the possibilities : this is the correlation between intensities of the wave trains coming from different stars as well as from the same star .",
    "in contrast , when formula ( [ w(p1p2 ) ] ) is derived , it is supposed that if one boson ( with momentum @xmath69 ) is emitted from the point @xmath70 , then another boson ( with momentum @xmath71 ) is emitted from different point @xmath72 and vice versa , but the possibility when the two bosons are emitted from the same point , @xmath70 or @xmath72 , is excluded . in the case of _ independent _ particles radiation all the possibilities have to be taken into account .",
    "for such a case one usually demonstrates the idea of the correlation femtoscopy method by means of factorization of the two - particle normalized emission function , @xmath73 and integrates the two - point probability ( [ w(p1p2 ) ] ) over the space - time region",

    "the latter requirement is satisfied in the above case of the flat momentum spectrum for each emitter , @xmath137 , since the initial quantum states @xmath138 taken in different points @xmath122 are orthogonal .",
    "if the momentum spectrum @xmath139 is essentially not flat , this corresponds to the wave packets characterized by their centers @xmath140 and some finite width . in this realistic case",
    "one can not consider quantum states with very close distances between emitter centers as distinguishable and independent because similar to the situation when two identical bosons are emitted from the same point , such a system gives no contribution to the bose - einstein correlation function @xcite , like a fully coherent state ( [ fullcoh ] ) .",
    "one can discriminate between the different states with emission centers @xmath140 and @xmath141 only if they are approximately orthogonal : the overlap integral ( [ gij ] ) is small , @xmath142 . in other words ,",
    "the distance between the centers of the emitters has to be larger than the width of the emitted wave packets . since the latter is the inverse of the variance @xmath143 of the momentum spectrum ,",
    "so @xmath144 .",
    "the latter expresses the uncertainty principle : one can discriminate the wave packet with center @xmath140 _ without noticeable violation of the particle spectrum _ if the measurement that localizes the particle s position somewhere inside the sphere with the center @xmath140 and the diameter not less than @xmath145 , unambiguously points to the quantum state with center @xmath140 , but not @xmath141 .",
    "so , the distance between the emitter centers @xmath146 should satisfy the uncertainty principle in the form @xmath147 .",
    "then the states are almost distinguishable and orthogonal , so the radiation from both emitters can be considered as independent and well approximated within the random phase approach with probabilities @xmath148 for separate quantum states .",

    "( [ phase - aver ] ) has to be smeared when one deals with wave packets .",
    "so , for normalized wave packets , one can not use the random phase approximation if the distance in space and time between emitters is less than the width @xmath145 of the wave packet ( in units @xmath62 ) .",

    "the last term expresses the uncertainty principle for energy - momentum & time measurements .",
    "therefore , the fully random phases , corresponding to the standard femtoscopy approach @xcite , are possible only under some conditions which we have discussed : the phase average for quantum states emitted from the points @xmath140 and @xmath141 , written in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ phase - aver ] ) , ( [ gij ] ) , @xmath156 has to be close to zero .",
    "here @xmath129 is the overlap integral ( [ gij ] ) , and @xmath143 is a variance of the momentum spectrum of emitters .    in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath157 , the states are indistinguishable and overlap integral ( [ phase - aver - gen ] ) @xmath158 at @xmath159 .",
    "then the result looks like the one for fully coherent radiation ( [ fullcoh ] ) , which takes place for very close emitters @xcite .",
    "so , in both limiting cases of chaotic and fully coherent emission eq .",
    "( [ phase - aver - gen ] ) leads to physically obvious results , and therefore the quantity ( [ phase - aver - gen ] ) , @xmath160 , is the natural measure of distinguishability / indistinguishability and mutual coherence of the two emitted states caused by the uncertainty principle at any distance between the emission centers @xmath161 . in this way",
    "we solve the problem of distinguishability of the quantum states @xmath162 associated with different emission points @xmath136 : we always sum @xmath122-amplitudes , not @xmath122-probabilities , and average the resulting distributions / spectra over partially coherent phases in correspondence with the requirement of maximal possible distinguishability and the independence of different @xmath122-states compatible with the uncertainty principle for momentum & position and energy - momentum & time measurements .",
    "we discussed above the simplest situation with only two emitted bosons ( pions ) .",
    "typically , the basic formalism of correlation interferometry in multipion systems for inclusive momentum spectra is similar @xcite : one can use the same basic formula ( [ femtobasic ] ) with the following substitutions : @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "the correlation between the space - time position @xmath140 of the emission point and momentum @xmath110 of emitted particle , reflected in @xmath110-dependence of the emission function @xmath166 , leads to dependence of the interferometry radii in formula ( [ gauss ] ) on the mean momentum @xmath110 of pion pair , @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath168 correlation appears due to fast expansion of the multiparticle systems created in high energy @xmath169 ( or even @xmath170 ) collisions .",
    "the radii @xmath171 are associated then with homogeneity lengths in @xmath122-direction in inhomogeneous expanding systems @xcite .",
    "so , one can carry the two - pion correlation results from the two - pion system to multiparticle systems if one applies the above substitutions .",
    "in fact , our quantum - mechanical consideration is related to the rest frame of the homogeneous emitting subsystem forming the spectra in a vicinity of some momentum @xmath110 .",
    "another aspect of multiparticle emission is that the two - pion wave function may not always be factorized out as for independent subsystems : @xmath172 , where state @xmath173 is related to the residual part of the total system .",
    "the symmetrization / antisymmetrization procedure has to be applied to the total system wave function @xmath174 .",
    "however , it can be difficult to provide it if one supposes the distinguishability of the radiation points as in the standard correlation interferometry method of independent sources @xcite .",
    "for example , let us suppose that one pion with momentum @xmath113 , @xmath175 is the primary particle emitted from the fireball near the point @xmath45 , and another pion @xmath176 with the momentum @xmath114 is emitted together with particle @xmath173 at the resonance decay , @xmath177 ( say , @xmath178 ) near the point @xmath46 .",
    "such a system may not have @xmath179 symmetry because    \\(i ) if at the @xmath179 exchange the momentum @xmath180 of the particle @xmath173 is preserved , then the momentum of emitted resonance is changed and gets the other value @xmath181 .",
    "this new resonance state has typically another probability to form as compared to the previous resonance state .",
    "( in extreme cases it can even happen that the value @xmath182 instead of @xmath183 excludes the resonance decay into the pair @xmath175 , @xmath184 because of the kinematics ) .",
    "in general , all that suppresses the interference effect @xcite ;    \\(ii ) if the exchange of @xmath185 momenta is accompanied by the change of @xmath180 by the value @xmath186 , @xmath187 , then the two configurations @xmath188 and @xmath189 become distinguishable and so can not interfere ;    \\(iii ) if at @xmath179 the particles @xmath184 together with @xmath176 are emitted by the resonance @xmath190 from the fireball near point @xmath45 and primary pion @xmath175 radiates from @xmath46 , the requirement of distinguishability of the emission points may lead to principal distinguishability of the emission points @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the particle @xmath173 that excludes the pion interference effect .",
    "so , the exact symmetry of the total system at @xmath191 exchange can be lost in similar situations , and the two configurations @xmath192 and @xmath193 of the two - pion subsystem can interfere only partially .",
    "this has to be taken into account in the transport models used for high energy collisions .",
    "the attempt to estimate the limits of applicability of the standard correlation femtoscopy is done in ref .",
    "it is argued that when @xmath194 then the classical phase - space position of the residual part of the system is changed by the value @xmath195 along each direction @xmath122 .",
    "if this change exceeds the size @xmath196 of the elementary cell of the phase - space per one degree of freedom , then the _ residual _ system moves to another quantum state , and it can be , in principle , measured .",
    "therefore the pion interference should disappear when @xmath197 ( @xmath62 ) , where @xmath198 is the effective system size / homogeneity length in @xmath122-direction .",
    "however , this argumentation fails already in the simplest case when the system contains only identical particles .",
    "such a system can be symmetrized with distinguishable and independent radiation points , and there is no principal possibility to measure the exchange of the momenta between two identical pions at any value of @xmath199 using for this aim the residual system containing the same sort of pions .",
    "we think that the real picture of the pion interference can be restored on the basis of symmetrized / antisymmetrized amplitude of the _ total _ system with partially coherent phases in the way described in subsection [ uncpr ] .",

    "<S> the basic principles of the correlation femtoscopy , including its correspondence to the hanbury brown and twiss intensity interferometry , are re - examined . </S>",
    "<S> the main subject of the paper is an analysis of the correlation femtoscopy when the source size is as small as the order of the uncertainty limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is about 1 fm for the current high energy experiments . </S>",
    "<S> then the standard femtoscopy model of random sources is inapplicable . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty principle leads to the partial indistinguishability and coherence of closely located emitters that affect the observed femtoscopy scales . in thermal systems </S>",
    "<S> the role of corresponding coherent length is taken by the thermal de broglie wavelength that also defines the size of a single emitter . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism of partially coherent phases in the amplitudes of closely located individual emitters is used for the quantitative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the general approach is illustrated analytically for the case of the gaussian approximation for emitting sources . </S>",
    "<S> a reduction of the interferometry radii and a suppression of the bose - einstein correlation functions for small sources due to the uncertainty principle are found . </S>",
    "<S> there is a positive correlation between the source size and the intercept of the correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarities of the non - femtoscopic correlations caused by minijets and fluctuations of the initial states of the systems formed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions are also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization property for the contributions of femtoscopic and non - femtoscopic correlations into complete correlation function is observed in numerical calculations in a wide range of the model parameters .    </S>",
