    "the measurement of the branching ratio ( br ) of 3pig  decay completes the kloe program of precision measurements of the dominant kaon branching ratios , fully inclusive of radiation effects .",
    "we have already published an evaluation , from a fit to the kloe measurements of the charged kaon lifetime @xcite , and brs , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , constraining the br sum to unity : br(@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the most recent br(@xmath8 measurement , based on 2330 events from a sample of @xmath1 10@xmath9 kaon decays , dates back to 1972 and gives no information on the radiation cut - off : br(@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the pdg value , br(@xmath11 @xcite , is obtained from a global fit that does not use any of the available br(@xmath8 measurements but the rate measurement @xmath12  s@xmath13 published in 1970 @xcite . furthermore the br(@xmath8 value enters in the evaluation of the difference @xmath14 between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17-wave @xmath18 scattering lengths @xcite @xcite ; this will be discussed in section 5 .    in the following we report the measurement of the absolute branching ratio br@xmath19 performed with the kloe detector using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity @xmath20 dt @xmath4 174 pb@xmath13 collected at , the frascati  @xcite .",

    ". the unique feature of a   is the tagging : detection of a @xmath27 ( the tagging kaon ) tags the presence of a @xmath28 ( the tagged kaon ) with known momentum and direction .",
    "the availability of tagged kaons enables the precision measurement of absolute brs providing the normalization sample .",
    "the decay products of the @xmath29 pair define two spatially well separated regions called in the following the tag and the signal hemispheres .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc )  @xcite , surrounded by a lead scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )  @xcite both immersed in an axial 0.52  t magnetic field produced by a superconducting coil . at the beams ip the spherical beam pipe of 10  cm radius is made of a beryllium - aluminum alloy of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "the dc tracking system has 25 cm internal radius , 4 m diameter and 3.3 m length , with a total of @xmath30 wires , of which @xmath31 are sense wires arranged in a stereo geometry . in order to minimize the multiple scattering and @xmath32 regeneration , and to maximize the detection efficiency for low energy photons , the dc works with a helium - based gas mixture and its walls",
    "are made of light materials , mostly carbon fiber composites .",
    "spatial resolutions are @xmath33 m and @xmath34  2 mm and the transverse momentum resolution is @xmath35 .",
    "the calorimeter covers 98% of the solid angle and is composed by a barrel and two endcaps .",
    "particles showering in the lead - scintillator - fiber emc structure are detected as local energy deposits by clustering signals from read - out elements . for each impinging particle",
    "the calorimeter information consists of energy , position of impact point and time of arrival with accuracies of @xmath36 = 5.7@xmath37 , @xmath38 = 1.2 cm/@xmath39 , @xmath40 = 1.2 cm , and @xmath41 .",
    "energy clusters not associated with reconstructed tracks in the dc ( neutral clusters ) identify neutral particles .",
    "the definition of energy clusters associated with reconstructed tracks is related to the track - to - cluster association procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the trigger @xcite is based on energy deposits in the calorimeter and on hit multiplicity in the drift chamber .",
    "only events triggered by the calorimeter have been used in the present analysis .",
    "the trigger system includes a second - level veto for cosmic - ray muons ( cosmic - ray veto or crv ) based on energy deposits in the outermost layers of the calorimeter and followed by a third - level software trigger .",
    "a software filter ( sf ) , based on the topology and multiplicity of energy clusters and drift chamber hits , is applied to filter out machine background .",
    "both crv and sf may be sources of events loss .",
    "their effect on the br measurement has been studied on control data samples acquired respectively without the crv and the sf filters .",
    "the data sample used for this analysis has been processed and filtered with the kloe standard reconstruction software and the event classification procedure @xcite .",
    "the kloe monte carlo ( mc ) simulation package , geanfi , has been used to produce a sample equivalent to data , accounting for the detector status and the machine operation on a run - by - run basis .",
    "tagging with  ( @xmath42 tags ) and  ( @xmath43 tags ) provides two indipendent samples of pure kaons for the signal selection useful for systematic uncertainties evaluation and cross - checks @xcite .",
    "these decays are easily identified as clear peaks in the distribution of p@xmath44 , the momentum of the charged secondary track in the kaon rest frame evaluated using the pion mass .",
    "distribution from @xmath42 decays is slightly broadened due to the pion mass hypothesis @xcite . ]",
    "the selection efficiency of the two tagging normalization samples are similar , about 36 %",
    ". then these events are classified as @xmath45 and archived in dedicated data summary tapes , as described in ref .",
    "mc studies show that the contamination due to @xmath21-meson decays other than @xmath29 is negligible .    to minimize the impact of the trigger efficiency on the signal side , we choose as normalization sample @xmath42 or @xmath43 tags providing the trigger of the event ( self - triggering two - body decays ) .",
    "after this request the @xmath42 sample is reduced by a factor of @xmath1 33% , while the @xmath43 sample by a factor of @xmath1 43%",
    ". the residual dependence of the signal sample on the tag selection , which we refer to as tag bias , has been evaluated for the br measurement .",
    "moreover we use @xmath46 as the tagging kaon ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) and @xmath2 as the tagged kaon ( signal ) , since the nuclear cross section for positive kaons with momenta @xmath4 100 mev is lower by a factor of @xmath47 with respect to that of negative kaons @xcite .",
    "the track of the tagging kaon is backward extrapolated from its first hit in the dc to the ip .",
    "we use the momentum of the tagging kaon at the ip , @xmath48 , and the momentum of the @xmath21-meson measured run by run with bhabha scattering events , @xmath49 , to evaluate the momentum of the tagged kaon at the ip , @xmath50 .",
    "finally we extrapolate @xmath51 inside the dc ( signal kaon path ) .",
    "the kaon and the three charged pions from its decay have low momenta , less than @xmath52 mev , and curl up in the kloe magnetic field ; this increases the probability to have poorly reconstructed tracks broken in more segments ( the track reconstruction procedure in kloe is described in ref .",
    "we significantly improve the quality of the reconstruction requiring the @xmath2 decay to occur before it reaches the dc sensitive volume , i.e. inside a cylindrical fiducial volume centered at the ip and with a transverse radius @xmath53 close to the dc inner wall ( detector acceptance @xmath1 26% ) . in this way only the pion tracks are reconstructed , and we extrapolate only two of them to search for a vertex along the signal kaon path .",
    "no further request on the charge of the particles is applied to maximize the selection efficiency .    to extract the number of @xmath54 we fit the missing mass spectrum @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the momenta of the selected tracks , with mc - predicted shapes for the signal and the background .",
    "the branching ratio is given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of signal events , @xmath60 is the number of tagged events and @xmath61 is the overall signal selection efficiency , including the detector acceptance and the reconstruction efficiency . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the corrections for the machine background filter and the cosmic - ray veto .",
    "@xmath64 accounts for the tag bias effect .",
    "the normalization sample is given by @xmath60 = 12065087   @xmath65 tagging events .",
    "the @xmath54 signal selection uses dc information only .    any reconstructed track identified as a @xmath2 ( and therefore corresponding to a @xmath2 outside the fiducial volume )",
    "is rejected .",
    "more specifically we reject tracks with the point of closest approach ( pca ) to the ip satisfying the conditions @xmath66 10  cm , and @xmath67 20  cm , with the momentum within @xmath68  mev , and with a good matching with the position and the momentum extrapolated from the tagging kaon .    to select the decay vertex @xmath69 we require at least two reconstructed tracks that have :    1 .",

    "the background composition is given by @xmath2 in two - body @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 , semileptonic @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xmath84 , and @xmath85 decays .",
    "these single track events pass the selection criteria because a secondary charged track is wrongly reconstructed as two separate tracks .",
    "the top panel of fig [ fig2 ] shows the result of the fit of the missing mass distribution compared to data .",
    "the fit gives @xmath86  =  48032@xmath87286 signal events ( the error accounting for data and mc statistics ) , with @xmath88/ndf = 44.8/46 ( p(@xmath88 ) = 0.52 ) .",
    "the bottom panel of fig [ fig2 ] shows the fit normalized residuals .",
    "the signal selection efficiency , @xmath61 , is related to the track reconstruction efficiency of two charged secondaries from @xmath2 decays .",
    "we evaluate the selection efficiency from mc , and then we correct it to take into account data - mc differences in the track reconstruction . to this aim",
    "we select , both on data and mc , a control sample of @xmath89 decays ( for signal events x corresponds to @xmath90 ) .",
    "the first requirement is the presence of a self - triggering @xmath65 in the tag hemisphere .",
    "then the track of the @xmath91 candidate is selected with the following requirements :    1 .",
    "the number of neutral clusters with an energy @xmath92 30 mev must be , n@xmath93 1 ; 2 .",
    "the momentum of the selected track in the kaon rest frame must be , p@xmath94  130  mev ; 3 .",
    "the distance of closest approach between the extrapolated track and the signal kaon path must be , dca@xmath95 @xmath71 7 cm ; 4 .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle between the momenta of the signal kaon and the momenta of the selected track must be , cos(@xmath96 - 0.85 .",
    "the control sample @xmath89 , selected with a background contamination of @xmath410.7@xmath97 , is used to measure the efficiency corrections as function of the total transverse momentum @xmath98 , and of the total longitudinal momentum @xmath99 of the @xmath100 pair ( the average efficiency correction is @xmath1 0.92 ) .",
    "the selection efficiency , is finally obtained folding the mc selection efficiency with the measured corrections : @xmath61 = 0.0842 @xmath87 0.0003 .",
