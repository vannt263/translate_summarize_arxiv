    "the first study of quark stars was performed by itoh @xcite for static matter in equilibrium .",
    "the physical processes governing the behaviour of quark matter with ultrahigh densities is still under investigation .",
    "of special interest is the equation of state for quark matter .",
    "the phenomenology of the mit bag model indicates that a linear form for the equation of state is possible with a nonzero bag constant .",
    "this is shown in the works by chodos _",
    "et al _ @xcite , farhi and jaffe @xcite and witten @xcite .",
    "the review of weber @xcite highlights models of compact astrophysical objects composed of strange quark stars .",
    "some recent investigations for compact objects with a quark equation of state include the treatments of kalam _",
    "et al _ @xcite and mafa takisa and maharaj @xcite .",
    "the effect of the electromagnetic field on quark star was studied by mak and harko @xcite in the presence of a conformal symmetry . sharma and",
    "maharaj @xcite considered the role of anisotropy for a specified mass distribution .",
    "charged anisotropy matter with a linear equation of state , extendible to the more general nonlinear case , was analysed by varela _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "other papers containing interesting features relating to charge and anisotropy are given in the references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "mak and harko @xcite found strange quark stars with isotropic pressures in the presence of charge .",
    "komathiraj and maharaj @xcite presented a method of solving the einstein - maxwell system to produce new models of charged quark stars . in the present work",
    "we show that the komathiraj and maharaj method allows us to integrate the einstein - maxwell equations with anisotropic pressures and charge .",
    "therefore we are able to generate new quark stars which are charged and anisotropic .",
    "two new classes of solutions to the field equations are obtained by specifying the measure of anisotropy .",
    "earlier solutions are shown to be contained in our results .",
    "a notable feature of our models is that we get the anisotropy to vanish , for particular parameter values , and isotropic pressures are regained . in many previous investigations",
    "the anisotropy is always present which is not desirable .",
    "a physical analysis indicates that the gravitational potentials and the matter variables are well behaved , and we can generate masses consistent with observations .",
    "we intend to model the stellar interior with quark matter in general relativity . the spacetime geometry is static and spherically symmetric .",
    "the interior spacetime is represented by the line element @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions representing gravity .",
    "the exterior spacetime is given by the reissner - nordstrom line element @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the total mass and charge of the star respectively .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for anisotropic charged fluid matter is of the form @xmath6 in the above @xmath7 is energy density , @xmath8 is the radial pressure , @xmath9 is the tangential pressure , and @xmath10 is the electric field intensity .",
    "these quantities are measured relative to a comoving unit timelike fluid four - velocity @xmath11 .",
    "then the einstein - maxwell equations can be written as    [ emf ] @xmath12    where primes denote differentiation with respect to radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 represents the proper charge density .",
    "we are using the units where the coupling constant and the speed of light are unity . for a quark star",
    "we assume a linear relationship between the radial pressure and the energy density @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bag constant . to transform the field equations to a more convenient form",
    "we introduce new variables defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are arbitrary constants",
    ". then the einstein - maxwell field equations ( [ emf ] ) for quark matter have the following form    [ nnewemf ] @xmath20    the quantity @xmath21 is the measure of anisotropy .",
    "this system consists of eight variables @xmath22 in six equations .",
    "it is apparent that if we specify two of these variables then the system may be integrated .",
    "the gravitational behavior of the anisotropic charged quark star is governed by the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath23 we have the isotropic model that was described by komathiraj and maharaj @xcite .",
    "for neutral fluids with isotropic pressures @xmath24 there is no freedom in the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) as the equation of state has been specified . for a charged fluid with anisotropic pressures @xmath25 , with the linear equation of state",
    ", there are two degrees of freedom because of the appearance of new matter quantities , the electric field and anisotropy . from a mathematical viewpoint any two of the eight variables",
    "may be chosen to integrate the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) ; the choice should be carefully made on physical grounds so that a well behaved model results .    in order to find exact solutions to this model we have to specify two quantities",
    ": we choose the potential @xmath26 and the quantity @xmath27 .",
    "we specify the metric function @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants .",
    "a similar choice was made by komathiraj and maharaj @xcite .",
    "the choice guarantees that the metric function @xmath26 is regular and well behaved within the interior .",
    "it remains finite at the centre of the star .",
    "note that special cases of the potential @xmath26 corresponds to known quark models , e.g. when @xmath32 , @xmath33 we regain the mak and harko @xcite quark star model and when @xmath34 , @xmath35 we regain the komathiraj and maharaj @xcite model for a quark star with isotropic pressures .",
    "we expect that the potential ( [ choice - y ] ) is therefore likely to produce new solutions , and more general models , to the einstein - maxwell system when charge and anisotropy are present .",
    "also we specify the measure of anisotropy in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 are arbitrary constants .",
    "this choice is physically reasonable and ensures that we regain isotropic pressures when @xmath38 .",
    "note that we have effectively taken three orders of a taylor expansion for @xmath27 in terms of the radial coordinate .",
    "this form of @xmath27 enables us to integrate the einstein - maxwell system ; higher order terms lead to expressions which are not integrable .",
    "an important point to note is that the form ( [ choice - delta ] ) allows us to regain isotropic pressures by setting parameters to vanish . in most other treatments involving anisotropic stellar configurations",
    "this is not the case as indicated in the work of dev and gleiser @xcite , esculpi and aloma @xcite , harko and mak @xcite , and mak and harko @xcite .",
    "the recent strange quark models of kalam _",
    "et al _ @xcite and paul _ et al _ @xcite also have a nonzero anisotropy throughout the star . in our model",
    "the choice ( [ choice - delta ] ) enables us to regain isotropic pressures . from ( [ choice - y ] ) and ( [ nnewemf4 ] ) , and simplifying using partial fractions , we obtain the differential equation @xmath39 once ( [ ode4 ] ) is integrated we can directly find the remaining quantities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath40 and @xmath14 from the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) . in order to find an exact solution to ( [ ode4 ] ) we need to specify values for the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we can find an exact solution to ( [ ode4 ] ) when @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this case line element",
    "becomes @xmath41 the matter variables are qiven by    [ exactsoln - mak - harko ] @xmath42\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\times \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x } ( a+\\sqrt{x})(2a+3\\sqrt{x})^{2}}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{mak - electricfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to simplify the relevant expressions we have set @xmath43 the exact solution ( [ mk - line element ] ) and ( [ exactsoln - mak - harko ] ) is a new model for a charged anisotropic quark star .",
    "if we set @xmath38 , then we regain the first komathiraj and maharaj @xcite line element @xmath44 with isotropic pressures and with equation of state @xmath45 .",
    "we observe that when we set @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in ( [ exactsoln - mak - harko ] ) we obtain expressions for the energy density @xmath7 , the pressure @xmath49 and electric field @xmath40 which are identical to those in the komathiraj and maharaj @xcite model .",
    "furthermore if we let @xmath50 in ( [ mk - line element2 ] ) we obtain mak and harko @xcite line element @xmath51 with the matter variables @xmath52 on setting @xmath53 we regain the misner and zapolsky @xcite particular solution with the equation of state @xmath54 .",
    "note that the class of solutions found in this section contains a singularity in the electric field at the centre .",
    "this feature is also present in the mak and harko @xcite model for quark star .",
    "however the total charge and mass remains finite which is a good feature of this class of models .",
    "we can find another exact solution of ( [ ode4 ] ) by choosing @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "for this choice the line element becomes @xmath55 the matter variables are    @xmath56    [ nonsingular - exact ]    for simplicity we have set @xmath57 the mass function giving the total mass within a sphere of radius @xmath58 is given by @xmath59    the exact solution ( [ nonsingular - line element1 ] ) and ( [ nonsingular - exact ] ) is a new model for the einstein - maxwell system with charge and anisotropy .",
    "if we set @xmath38 , then we regain the second komathiraj and maharaj @xcite line element @xmath60 with isotropic pressures .",
    "we observe that when we set @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in ( [ nonsingular - exact ] ) we obtain expressions for the energy density @xmath7 , the pressure @xmath49 and electric field @xmath40 corresponding to the nonsingular komathiraj and maharaj @xcite model .",
    "the matter variables , including the electric field , remain finite at the centre so that the model is nonsingular",
    ". consequently the class of solutions found in this section are good candidates to produce charged anisotropic stars with physically reasonable interior distributions .",
    "in this section we indicate that the exact solution of the field equations of the previous section are well behaved .",
    "to do this we generate graphical plots for the gravitational potentials , matter variables and the electric field .",
    "the python programming language was used to generate plots for the particular choices @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the graphical plots generated are for the potential @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ one ] ) , potential @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ two ] ) , energy density @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ three ] ) , radial pressure @xmath74 ( fig . [ four ] ) , tangential pressure @xmath9 ( fig . [ five ] ) , measure of anisotropy @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ six ] ) , the electric field @xmath40 ( fig . [ seven ] ) and the mass @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ eight ] ) .",
    "all figures are plotted against the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "these quantities are regular and well behaved in the stellar interior . the energy density , the radial pressure and the tangential pressure are decreasing functions as we approach the boundary from the centre . in general the measure of anisotropy",
    "@xmath27 is finite and continuous .",
    "we observe that @xmath27 increases from the centre until it attains a maximum value and decreases sharply towards the surface of the star .",
    "this profile is similar to that obtained by sharma and maharaj @xcite and mafa takisa and maharaj @xcite .",
    "the electric field @xmath40 is finite and regular at the centre .",
    "it increases from the centre and then decreases after reaching a maximum value .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ eight ] that the mass increases with radial distance monotonically .",
    "finally we note for the values @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 we can generate a quark star with radius @xmath82 km and mass @xmath83 .",
    "these figures correspond to a distribution with a linear quark equation of state .",
    "they are consistent with the values found by mak and harko @xcite .",
    "other values of the parameters produce radii and masses consistent with previous investigations .",
    "a detailed analysis of the physical features of the models found here will be undertaken in future work .",
