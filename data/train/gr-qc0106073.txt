    "the @xmath0-mode instability , and the associated spin - down of rapidly rotating young neutron stars , has created considerable interest in the astrophysical community , particularly as this may be a detectable source of gravitational waves .",
    "however , it was soon realized that a lot of effects tend to work against the growth of the @xmath0-mode .",
    "viscous damping , coupling to the crust , magnetic fields and differential rotation could severely reduce the importance of the instability , if not suppress it completely .",
    "since there is a large number of papers published on this subject we refer the reader to two recent reviews ( andersson & kokkotas , 2001 ; friedman & lockitch , 2001 ) .",
    "most of the results have been obtained in a newtonian context , with radiation effects incorporated through the standard multipole formulae .",
    "however , in a first step towards a fully relativistic treatment , it was first shown by kojima ( 1997 , 1998 ) that the newtonian treatment might actually miss important relativistic effects , such as the frame dragging .",
    "working in the low - frequency approximation , which actually neglects any gravitational radiation , he showed that instead of having a discrete @xmath0-mode frequency , the frame dragging , being a function of the stellar radius @xmath0 , gives rise to a whole band of frequencies .",
    "the existence of this continuous spectrum was proven by beyer & kokkotas ( 1999 ) in a rigorous way .",
    "however , it is still possible to find mode solutions for uniform density stars , as has been shown by lockitch , andersson & friedman ( 2001 ) . in a previous paper ( ruoff & kokkotas , 2001 ) , which we refer to henceforth as paper i",
    ", we have corroborated these results both through explicit mode calculations and through the evolution of the time dependent equations .",
    "however , at the same time we have shown that certain polytropic models , and some stellar models based on realistic equations of state , do not allow the existence of physical @xmath0-modes .",
    "although for @xmath3 , it was always possible to find a mathematically valid mode solution with its eigenfrequency lying inside the continuous band , the associated fluid velocity was diverging at some point inside the star .",
    "therefore , we considered such solutions as being unphysical , and hence non - existent .",
    "this view was supported by the explicit time evolution of the relevant equations , as the system did not show any tendency to oscillate with the `` unphysical '' frequency predicted by the mode calculation .",
    "these results were obtained in the low - frequency approximation , which amounts to neglecting the radiative metric perturbations . in this paper , we consider the complete set of axial equations , which follow from expanding the einstein equations up to first order in the rotation rate @xmath1 .",
    "however , we do not include the coupling to the polar equations . as we shall show , the main results from paper i concerning the existence of the @xmath0-mode more or less directly carry over to the fully relativistic case .",
    "this means that even if one takes into account the radiative back - reaction , there are certain cases where , at least within the slow - rotation approximation , discrete purely axial @xmath0-modes can not be found .",
    "if we focus on purely axial perturbations , the perturbed metric can be written in the following form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denote the scalar spherical harmonics .",
    "the unperturbed metric @xmath6 represents a non - rotating stellar model with a first order rotational correction @xmath7 ( the frame dragging ) in the @xmath8-component : @xmath9 the fluid is assumed to rotate with uniform angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the axial component of the fluid velocity perturbation can be expanded as @xmath10 einstein s field equations then reduce to three equations for the three variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( kojima 1992 ) .    to obtain a system of equations , which is suitable for the numerical time evolution ,",
    "the most straightforward way is to use the adm - formalism ( arnowitt , deser & misner 1962 , ruoff 2001 ) .",
    "for the axial perturbations , the expansion of the metric variables @xmath14 , and extrinsic curvature variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 , has been given in paper i. we just restate the connection between those variables and the ones defined above : @xmath17 the evolution equations for the variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 are @xmath19\\;,\\\\    \\label{k3 }    { \\left ( } { \\frac{\\partial { } } { \\partial { t } } } + { \\mbox{\\rm i}}m\\omega{\\right)}k_3 & = & \\frac{l(l+1 ) -2}{r^2}v_4    + \\frac{2{\\mbox{\\rm i}}m}{l(l+1)}\\omega'e^{-2\\lam}k_6\\;,\\\\    \\label{k6 }    { \\left ( } { \\frac{\\partial { } } { \\partial { t } } } + { \\mbox{\\rm i}}m\\omega{\\right)}k_6 & = & v_4 ' - \\frac{{\\mbox{\\rm i}}mr^2}{l(l+1 ) }    \\left[\\omega'k_3 - 16\\pi\\varpi(p + \\eps)u_3\\right]\\;,\\\\    \\label{u3 }    { \\left ( } { \\frac{\\partial { } } { \\partial { t } } } + { \\mbox{\\rm i}}m\\omega{\\right)}u_3 & = & \\frac{2{\\mbox{\\rm i}}m\\varpi}{l(l+1 ) }    { \\left(}u_3 - k_6{\\right)}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the abbreviation @xmath20 furthermore , we have one momentum constraint : @xmath21 we could use this constraint to replace @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ k6 ] ) and thus obtain a complete set of three equations . however , we prefer to use the above set of four equations and use the constraint to monitor the numerical evolution .",
    "of course , we also need the constraint ( [ k6 ] ) to construct valid initial data .",
    "we evolve the above system using a two - step lax - wendroff scheme yielding second order convergence , which can be easily checked by monitoring the violation of the momentum constraint ( [ mc_odd ] ) for different spatial resolutions .",
    "the above system of evolution equations describe both the @xmath22- and @xmath0-modes . in this paper",
    ", we would like to focus on the @xmath0-modes only , and so we will try to minimise the @xmath22-mode contribution by choosing appropriate initial data .",
    "in addition we will compare the evolution of the full system with the evolution of the equations in the low - frequency approximation .    in the low - frequency approximation , @xmath23 , and the evolution system involves only the variables @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "as initial data , we chose an arbitrary function for @xmath18 and solved the elliptic equation ( 32 ) of paper i for @xmath24 .",
    "for the full system , we can do exactly the same .",
    "we set @xmath25 and choose an arbitrary function for @xmath18 .",
    "next , we solve eq .",
    "( 32 ) of paper i for @xmath16 and finally compute the remaining variable @xmath15 from the momentum constraint ( [ mc_odd ] ) .",
    "the conversion of the evolution system ( [ v4 ] )  ( [ u3 ] ) into a time independent form is straightforward . assuming a harmonic time dependence @xmath26",
    ", we can deduce the following two ordinary differential equations : @xmath27 together with the two algebraic relations : @xmath28 eq .",
    "( [ u3alg ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( 40 ) of paper i and is singular if the denominator becomes zero , which can only happen if @xmath29 is real . for real sigma , the expression @xmath30 can also vanish , and eq .",
    "( [ k3alg ] ) becomes ill defined .",
    "however , as @xmath29 is expected to be a complex frequency , both equations for @xmath15 and @xmath18 should remain regular .",
    "still , these singular structures can pose difficulties for the numerical treatment when the imaginary part of @xmath29 becomes very small .",
    "we should make a few more remarks on the above system . in principle",
    "we could transform it into a single second order ode for the quantity @xmath14",
    ". however , this equation would be rather messy since the necessary algebra leads to many terms quadratic in @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "if , however , we neglect any terms quadratic or of higher power in @xmath1 and @xmath7 , we can recover eq .",
    "( 42 ) of kojima ( 1992 ) with the polar source terms",
    "@xmath31 set to zero .",
    "this equation was later used by andersson ( 1998 ) to compute the rotational corrections to the axial @xmath22-modes and the @xmath0-modes .    however , as we shall show , the values given by andersson for the @xmath0-modes can not be corroborated neither through the time evolution nor through mode calculation with the above set of equations .",
    "this is because the extra terms that are not included in his form of the equations are critical , at least for the study of the @xmath0-modes . to be more specific",
    ", a basic property of the @xmath0-modes is that their frequency @xmath29 is proportional to the rotation rate @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the coefficient of @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ u3alg ] ) is not of order @xmath1 but of order 1 , i.e.  @xmath18 and @xmath16 are of the same order .",
    "if one looks for an equation similar to eq .",
    "( 42 ) of kojima ( 1992 ) , which is second order in @xmath29 , it is clear that one has to retain all the @xmath32 terms if one wants to correctly compute the @xmath0-mode frequencies , because in this case , it is @xmath33 .",
    "however , in eqns .",
    "( 42 ) of kojima ( 1992 ) and ( 10 ) of andersson ( 1998 ) , the @xmath32 terms were discarded , hence these equations are not suitable for computing correct @xmath0-mode frequencies .",
    "therefore , we leave eqs .",
    "( [ v4ode ] )  ( [ k6ode ] ) as they are , and solve them as a coupled first order system . to this end we follow the method of andersson ( 1998 ) and integrate ( [ v4ode ] ) and ( [ k6ode ] ) using a complex valued @xmath0 coordinate in the exterior spacetime . in the asymptotic exterior ,",
    "the behaviour of the perturbation variables is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the well - known tortoise coordinate .",
    "the quasi - normal modes are defined as purely outgoing solutions , i.e.  solutions with @xmath36 . for a complex - valued frequency @xmath29 , the amplitude of one of the terms in eq.([asy ] ) will always diverge if the integration is performed along the real @xmath0-axis .",
    "however , this can be overcome by choosing the path of integration in the complex @xmath0-plane to be a straight line with the angle to the real @xmath0-axis given by arg(@xmath0 ) = -arg(@xmath29 ) . in a region",
    "far enough from the stellar surface , we then test our solution by computing the wronskian with the pure outgoing solution @xmath37 .",
    "the vanishing of the wronskian tells us that we have found a quasi - normal mode of the star .",
    "we have tested this method by computing the axial @xmath22-modes for non - rotating neutron star models , reproducing the values given by kokkotas ( 1994 ) for uniform density models and other polytropic models .",
    "in the newtonian limit , one can estimate the growth time for the @xmath38 @xmath0-modes of uniform density models as ( kokkotas & stergioulas , 1999 ) @xmath39 in general , the growth time is proportional to @xmath40 , whereas the oscillation period increases linearly with the rotation period @xmath41 .",
    "of course , formula ( [ g_rate ] ) has been derived by applying the standard multipole formulae for the mass and current multipole moments obtained from newtonian theory .",
    "it is clear that for very compact stars , there should be deviations due to higher order corrections . in fig .  1",
    ", we show the growth times for four uniform density models with different values of the compactness @xmath42 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 . in a double - logarithmic plot ,",
    "a power law is represented by a straight line . for the less relativistic stellar models with",
    "@xmath42 0.1 and 0.2 , the agreement of formula ( [ g_rate ] ) with the results of our mode calculations for @xmath3 is very good , and for higher values of @xmath43 , we can recover the @xmath44 dependence of the exponent , in fact we find that @xmath45 for more relativistic models , however , we find a systematic deviation and the growth time rather goes with a power of @xmath46 , for small values of @xmath41 .",
    "for large values of @xmath41 , we still have a @xmath44 dependence , however , formula ( [ g_rate ] ) tends to underestimate the growth times , i.e.  the instability is not as strong as formula ( [ g_rate ] ) suggests .",
    "this weakening of the instability for very compact stellar models might be linked to the formation of a potential well inside the star , which can trap the gravitational waves .",
    "this would make it more difficult for the mode to grow .",
    "nevertheless , for uniform density models with a compactness in the range of realistic neutron star models , the agreement between relativistic linear perturbation theory and the results from the multipole formula is very good .",
    "in addition to mode calculations , we also performed the explicit evolution of the time dependent equations .",
    "the results for the four different compactness ratios are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "to make the growth time accessible to the numerical evolution , we have chosen the rotation rate to be @xmath47 corresponding to values of @xmath48ms .",
    "this is significantly above the kepler limit , which is given approximately by @xmath49 . above this rotation rate",
    "the star becomes unstable with respect to mass shedding .",
    "of course , in this case , the slow - rotation approximation is not valid any more , but if implemented correctly , the mode calculation and the time evolution should always yield the same complex - valued frequencies for any given value of @xmath50 . in all four cases ,",
    "it is clearly discernible that after a short initial time , an exponentially growing mode appears , which soon dominates the evolution . from the mode calculations we obtain the growth times given in table 1 . in the graphs of fig .  2 , we have indicated these growth times by straight lines , matching exactly the amplitudes of the growing modes .",

    "moreover , the metric variable @xmath64 exhibited an infinite slope at this particular point .",
    "based on these facts , we considered such solutions as being unphysical , and hence nonexistent .",
    "we we able to corroborate our point of view by explicitly evolving the time dependent equation , which showed that there was no sign of a mode at the frequency predicted by the mode calculation . a further indication came from the behaviour of the amplitude of the metric variable @xmath64 . in those cases where a physical mode existed , the amplitude remained constant after a certain initial time , whereas in the other cases",
    ", the amplitude kept decaying .",
    "of course , the low - frequency approximation is quite restrictive , since it cuts off the gravitational radiation .",
    "this is the reason why the associated eigenvalue problem becomes singular , as the mode frequencies have to be real valued . with the inclusion of the gravitational radiation ,",
    "each mode acquires a finite imaginary part , being positive for a damped mode and negative for a growing mode .",
    "the addition of an imaginary part ( no matter how small ) to the mode frequencies removes the singular structure of the equations .",
    "hence , it has been argued that in considering the problem with the inclusion of the gravitational radiation effect , one should be able to find the @xmath0-modes , with the anticipated growth times derived from newtonian theory .",
    "we find that this does not prove to be the case . for uniform density models ,",
    "the equations are _ always _ regular , i.e.  both with and without the radiative terms , and it is always possible to find a physical @xmath0-mode . however , all those stellar models which did not admit physical @xmath0-modes in the low - frequency approximation _ still _ do not do so when radiation reaction is included . in other words , the qualitative picture which has emerged from the low - frequency approximation does not change at all .    in fig .  3",

    ", we find the expected exponential growth , in agreement with the values computed from explicit mode calculations . however , for the other values @xmath69 , 0.8 and 1.0 , no growth is visible and instead the amplitude decays . this decay becomes stronger as @xmath2 is increased .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the imaginary parts of the frequency for a sequence of polytropic models with the polytropic index @xmath2 ranging from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in steps of 0.05 .",
    "both panels show the same data . in the right panel , however , the plot is on a logarithmic scale and for a larger range of @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that the kepler limit is reached for @xmath72 , hence any value of @xmath50 above is unphysical .",
    "we nevertheless show the behaviour of the growth times up to @xmath73 , in order to gain more insight into how the mode disappears . for @xmath74 , the growth times follows the expected power law in the range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 . for larger @xmath50 ,",
    "a deviation becomes obvious .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , this deviation becomes more pronounced and a bulge starts to emerge at @xmath77 , at which the imaginary parts tend to become smaller .",
    "recall that smaller imaginary part means longer growth time . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the curve exhibits a local minimum at @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    "the curves cross the zero line at some specific value of @xmath50 and reappear at some larger value of @xmath50 .",
    "the larger @xmath2 is , the sooner the imaginary part becomes zero , and the larger @xmath50 is at the reappearance point . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the imaginary part becomes zero at @xmath82 , for larger @xmath2 this occurs even for much smaller @xmath50 .    from the left panel of fig .",
    "4 , one could be led to the conclusion that the imaginary part does not vanish but actually crosses the @xmath50-axis and becomes negative .",
    "this would correspond to the @xmath0-mode being damped .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case .",
    "what happens instead is that it becomes impossible to numerically find the mode at all .",
    "of course , numerically not finding the mode does not mean that the mode ceases to exist for certain parameters , but from the analogy with the results of the low - frequency approximation , we conclude that the @xmath0-mode does indeed vanish , and there is only the ( non - radiative ) continuous spectrum left .",
    "this view is corroborated by the numerical evolutions , which in those cases show the decay of the metric amplitude , whereas each fluid layer oscillates with its own frequency , keeping a constant amplitude in exactly the same way as it did in the low - frequency approximation .",
    "this is clarified in fig .  5 , where we show the evolution of the same initial data , once using the full set of equations , and once using the low - frequency approximation .",
    "we plot the amplitudes of both the fluid variable @xmath18 ( somewhere inside the star ) and the metric variable @xmath16 ( somewhere outside the star ) .",
    "as it can been seen , after about 10 ms , the fluid variable @xmath18 remains at the same constant amplitude for both cases , whereas @xmath16 keeps decaying .",
    "it decays even faster in the full case than in the low - frequency approximation .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath16 is smaller from the very beginning because the radiative metric variable @xmath14 absorbs some of the energy of the initial data and radiates it away in a sharp pulse .",
    "this is not possible in the low - frequency approximation , since there the radiation effects are neglected .    finally , in fig .  6",
    ", we show the dependence of the complex mode frequency @xmath29 on the polytropic index @xmath2 , for a sequence of polytropic models with fixed compactness @xmath83 and a rotation period of @xmath84ms .",
    "we plot both the real and the imaginary part of @xmath29 in the same graph , using the left scale for the real part and the right scale for the imaginary part .",
    "in addition we include the region of the continuous spectrum , which is bounded by @xmath85 for small @xmath2 , the real part re@xmath86 lies outside the range of the continuous spectrum , but for increasing @xmath2 it approaches the lower boundary .",
    "the imaginary part im@xmath86 first grows with increasing @xmath2 , but eventually turns around and drops sharply down to zero . in this case",
    ", re@xmath86 reaches the lower boundary of the continuous spectrum and im@xmath86 goes to zero for @xmath87 .",
    "no mode can be found for larger @xmath2 .      as with the polytropic models",
    ", we can more or less take over the results of paper i for models which are based on a realistic eos .",
    "it is for the stiffest eos that @xmath0-modes can exist for the whole physically acceptable mass range , whereas for intermediate eos , the @xmath0-mode vanishes if the compactness exceeds a certain critical value . for the softest eos",
    ", none of the models can support @xmath0-modes .",
    "we have performed both mode calculations and time evolutions of purely axial perturbations of rotating neutron stars using the slow - rotation approximation , i.e.  including only rotational correction terms linear in the angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "this work is thus an extension of our previous results of paper i. we have shown that on the one hand , we are in full agreement with newtonian - limit predictions for uniform density models , but on the other hand , we obtain completely different results for relativistic stars obeying polytropic equations of state with the polytropic index @xmath2 being larger than about 0.8 . in agreement with our previous analysis of the @xmath0-modes in the low - frequency approximation ( paper i ) , we showed that in these cases , no discrete @xmath0-modes can be found .",
    "for the uniform density models , we find that for less relativistic models , the growth time is well described by a power law with an exponent of @xmath88 , whereas for more relativistic models the strength of the instability is somewhat suppressed .",
    "we conjecture that this can be traced back to the appearance of a potential well inside the star , which on the one hand can trap the gravitational waves and thus give rise to very long - lived spacetime modes ( the trapped modes ) , but on the other hand should reduce the growth of the unstable @xmath0-mode .    in paper",
    "i , we have shown that due to the singular structure of the eigenvalue equation in the low - frequency approximation , there exists a class of physically reasonable stellar models based on polytropic or certain soft realistic equations of state , which does not permit the existence of physical @xmath0-modes . as a result of the present work ,",
    "it became clear that even with the inclusion of the gravitational radiation reaction , the slow - rotation approximation can still fail to yield the @xmath0-mode solutions expected from newtonian theory .",
    "although we can find very good agreement for uniform density models , the @xmath0-modes seem to disappear for the relativistic polytropic cases with large polytropic index @xmath2 .",
    "it might well be that inclusion of higher order corrections in @xmath1 or the coupling to the polar equations will drastically change the above picture , and relativistic @xmath0-modes can be found for any stellar model .",
    "however , it also might be the case that the above picture persists , and that the @xmath0-modes simply do not exist for certain stellar models , which might be a consequence of the relativistic frame dragging .",
    "a first hint in this direction might come from recent results by karino et al .",
    "they computed the @xmath0-modes of rapidly and differentially rotating newtonian polytropic models without resorting to the slow - rotation approximation .",
    "they found that for certain parameters of the rotation , their numerical scheme ceases to yield mode solutions , because of the appearance of co - rotation points . through this analogy",
    ", we may conjecture that the same could hold in the rapidly rotating case , where one does not expand the equations in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "of course , not finding the modes numerically does not prove their non - existence .",
    "however , the results of karino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) seem at least to indicate that even if there exist @xmath0-modes in the regime where their code failed to detect any , they might at least be strongly affected by the differential rotation and have quite different physical properties than the @xmath0-modes in weakly differentially or uniformly rotating stars",
    ".    the same could be true for the relativistic @xmath0-modes of those stellar models where , within the slow - rotation approximation , one can not find any , as the relativistic frame dragging has an effect similar to that of differential rotation .",
    "if it is only by including higher order terms that the true physical @xmath0-modes can be found , we might expect them to have quite different physical properties , and probably much larger growth times , as would be expected from newtonian theory .",
    "of course , if the true eos of a neutron star is such that it already permits the existence of @xmath0-modes in the slow - rotation approximation , i.e.  if the eos is rather stiff , and unless other physical mechanism do not prevent the @xmath0-mode from growing , then the results obtained from newtonian theory should be reliable .",
    "on the other hand if the eos is rather soft , then it might well turn out that the implications of the @xmath0-mode instability , as based on newtonian estimates , such as spin - down scenarios and gravitational wave emission , might be less significant .",
    "either way , a full understanding of the relativistic @xmath0-modes is still outstanding and has to take into account at least the coupling to the polar equations , if not even the inclusion of all @xmath89 corrections .",
