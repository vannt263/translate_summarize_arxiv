    "mean - field theories such as the hartree - fock theory ( hf ) , the haree - fock bogoliubov theory , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , and the quasi - particle rpa have extensively been used to study the ground states and collective excitations of atomic nuclei @xcite . for more realistic theoretical treatment of nuclei such as inclusion of the ground - state correlations",
    "other than pairing correlations and the damping effects of collective excitations , however , we must go beyond the mean - field theories .",
    "the time - dependent density - matrix theory ( tddm ) @xcite which has been formulated by truncating the chain of the equations of motion for reduced density matrices up to the two - body level is one of such extended mean - field theories .",

    "[ fig4 ] , an improvement similar to the @xmath138 case is achieved .",
    "the importance of the three - body correlation matrix in the standard lipkin model is strongly in contrast to the case of an extended lipkin - model hamiltonian which we have previously studied @xcite .",
    "the extended lipkin model has the additional particle scattering term ( @xmath144 term ) @xcite @xmath145.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this @xmath144 term generates a mean - field potential @xcite and gives nonzero off - diagonal elements of the occupation matrix , that is , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",

    "( [ elipkin ] ) is carried as the mean - field energy @xcite , almost independently of the strength of the @xmath144 term . as a consequence ,",
    "the two - body correlation matrix and the correlation energy become quite small in the extended lipkin model .",
    "the effect of the three - body correlations on the ground - state energy was found even smaller when the @xmath144 term was included @xcite . in the case of the extended lipkin model",
    "the ground - state energies calculated in tddm1 are always above the exact values and such an overbound problem as in the standard lipkin model does not occur .",
    "now the importance of the three - body ground - state correlations in the standard lipkin model is understood as a consequence of lack of the mean - field energy , which makes the truncation of the reduced density matrices up to the two - body level unreliable and enhances the relative importance of the three - body correlations .",
    "the standard lipkin model has _",
    "deformed _ hf solutions with @xmath149 for @xmath150 @xcite , which consequently carry the mean - field energy which sums up already a lot of correlations .",
    "one may then think that the truncation up to the two - body level be reliable when the two - body correlation matrix is defined using the deformed hf single - particle states . to answer this question , we performed a simplified gradient - method calculation where the three - body parts in eq .",
    "( [ gradient ] ) are neglected and a deformed hf state at @xmath151 is used as the initial state .",
    "we found that the converged results are the same as those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] : the residual interaction plays a role in restoring the symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ elipkin ] ) which is violated by the deformed hf solution . in other words starting with a deformed solution , at the end of the iteration cycle the solution is back to sphericity. thus the use of the deformed hf basis does not improve the two - body level approximation for the standard lipkin model .",
    "this somewhat surprising feature may be due to the small number of particles considered .",
    "it is known that standard deformed rpa becomes exact in the macroscopic limit .",

    "the effect of the three - body correlations on the one - phonon state is drastic because it significantly improves the occupation probabilities and the two - body correlation matrices as shown in figs [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",

    "the excitation energies of the one - phonon state in irpa and irpa1 are larger than the exact values and increase with increasing @xmath139 .",
    "this is explained by the increase in the self - energy terms in eq .",
    "( [ a - term ] ) . since the deviation of the occupation matrix and correlation matrix from the exact values is larger in tddm1 than in tddm , the excitation energies in irpa1 are larger than those in irpa .",
    "the difference between the results in irpa and erpa and also between irpa1 and erpa1 is due to the coupling of the one - body amplitudes to the two - body ones .",
    "since the parity of the number of particle - hole pairs is conserved in the standard lipkin model , the one - body amplitudes can couple to the two - body amplitudes that have the same parity : for example , @xmath155 couples to @xmath156 , which expresses excitations built on the two particle - two hole configurations in the ground state . as shown in fig .",

    ", the two - phonon state excited by @xmath158 does not couple to the one - phonon state in the standard lipkin model .",
    "the excitation energies both in erpa and erpa1 are higher than the exact value and the improvement of the two - phonon state due to the inclusion of the three - body correlations is not so large as in the case of the one - phonon state .",
    "this indicates that the correlations among the two - body amplitudes are not sufficient to lower the energy of the two - phonon state , suggesting the importance of the coupling to the three - body amplitudes which are neglected in erpa and erpa1 .",

    "this means that the stability condition is not always satisfied for unphysical states .",
    "these states correspond to non - collective phonons as discussed in ref .",
    "the density - matrix formalism which includes the effects of three - body correlations on the ground state was applied to the standard lipkin model .",
    "it was found that the inclusion of the three - body correlations removes unpleasant features of the two - body level approximation and drastically improves the ground - state properties .",
    "it was discussed that the importance of the three - body correlations in the standard lipkin model is attributed to the fact that it does not have the mean - field contributions when the conservation of the number of particle - hole pairs is respected .",

    "it was found that the spectrum of the one - phonon state is drastically improved by the inclusion of the three - body correlations . in the case of the two - phonon states , however , the agreement with the exact solutions is not so good as in the case of the one - phonon states , which suggests the importance of the coupling to the three - body amplitudes .",
    "inclusion of the three - body correlations for realistic nuclei may be impracticable .",
    "fortunately , mean - field effects are quite important in nuclei and the mean - field theories give good first description for ground states and collective excitations .",
