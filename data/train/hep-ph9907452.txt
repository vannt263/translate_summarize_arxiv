    "historically , neutrinos contributed significantly in the development of particle theory .",
    "firstly , pauli postulated it to satisfy the energy conservation and rotational invariance . then weak interaction with neutrinos",
    "was described by fermi s four fermion interaction which was known to be nonrenormalizable .",
    "thus the current renormalizable theory of weak interactions , standard model(sm ) , can be traced to the origin where the introduction of the electron type neutrino , @xmath3 , was crucial .",
    "however , neutrinos have been elusive , which made it difficult to find their properties such as the masses and magnetic moments .",
    "we are now in the new era of neutrinos with the accumulating evidence on their oscillation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have some information on @xmath4 and mixing angles . these important data , especially the maximal mixing of the muon type neutrino @xmath5 with a neutrino other than @xmath3 , @xmath6 may hint a new particle(s ) or a new theory .    because it has been turned out that the mixing angles are almost maximal , it is worthwhile to study the neutrino mass generating mechanisms without using the see - saw mechanism . to pose the problem within the zoo of the known sm fermions ,",
    "we assume that for weakly interacting fermions there exist only the sm fermions below the electroweak scale .",
    "but we will introduce scalars if needed . [ with supersymmetry , the fermions , axino  @xcite and gravitino  @xcite , can be light since their interactions are much weaker than the weak interaction . ]",
    "namely we are assuming three light neutrinos : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we do not assume light sterile neutrinos . then there does not exist a dirac mass term for neutrinos .",
    "neutrino masses must be of the majorana type , @xmath9 where the matrix @xmath10 is omitted for the simplicity of notation .",
    "the majorana neutrino mass term violates the lepton number @xmath0 .",
    "thus the neutrino masses can arise only if the theory violates the lepton number .",
    "the well known see - saw mechanism@xcite violates @xmath0 through the majorana mass term at high energy scale which is the source for the light neutrino masses .    in this paper",
    ", we study phenomenological implications of the neutrino mass of a model which does not have a true goldstone boson . toward a model with this property",
    ", we will not introduce a neutral scalar field .",
    "then in the vacuum respecting @xmath11 invariance , there is no place for a goldstone boson .",
    "of course , with neutral scalars introduced , the potential can have appropriate parameters so that the additional hypothetical neutral scalars do not develop vev s .",
    "we simply do not bother to worry about to find this limited region of the parameter space .    in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a few models in which neutrino masses have been generated . in this short review ,",
    "we emphasize the symmetry argument and relate it to feynman diagrams . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss a model without neutral higgs scalar field to avoid possible problems with goldstone bosons . in this model",
    ", we present the limits of the parameters introduced from various experimental data .",
    "iv is a conclusion .",
    "for the neutrino mass , it is important to pinpoint how the @xmath0 symmetry is broken in the model . in the literature , already there",
    "exist numerous studies on the @xmath0 symmetry violation through singly charged scalars . in this section , we briefly comment on the diagrammatic symmetry argument in these models .",
    "majorana neutrino mass can be generated with a triplet higgs scalar @xmath12 through the interactions @xcite f_ij , where @xmath13 is symmetric under the exchange of indices .",
    "if we assume @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath14 . to generate neutrino mass @xmath0 must be broken spontaneously , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "we take the following potential for the triplet and one higgs doublet @xmath16 v = m^2 h^ h + m^2 ^+ _ 1 ( h^h)^2 + _ 2 ( ^)^2 + _ 3 ( h^h ) ( ^ ) . where we have not allowed the cubic term , ( |^0 h^0 h^0 + ^- h^+ h^0 + ^h^+ h^+)+h.c .. with the potential eq . ( 4 )",
    ", the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be developed .",
    "the presence of non  zero vev of the neutral triplet higgs boson modifies the @xmath19 parameter as follows @xcite : = . from @xmath20 @xcite",
    ", one can obtain @xmath21 gev . to introduce an ev range neutrino mass , @xmath22  o(ev ) .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath23 must be fine  tuned to equal to @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "this is unnatural .",
    "moreover , this model contains the massless cp  odd field ( majoron ) which corresponds to the goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 and cp  even field which has a small mass proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the @xmath25 decay into the majoron and the light scalar with a decay width of two neutrino flavors @xcite , which is ruled out because of the lep results of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mev @xcite . but this model with the cubic terms given in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , which violates @xmath0 explicitly , can be considered natural since the vacuum expectation value is of order @xmath28 in the limit @xmath29 and consistent with the lep data because all physical neutral scalars become heavy @xcite .",
    "another @xmath0 violating model was proposed by zee  @xcite , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 lepton doublet , @xmath33 with @xmath34 is the higgs doublet present in the sm lagrangian @xmath35 , @xmath36 with @xmath34 is the higgs doublet _ not coupled to fermions _ , @xmath37 is a singly charged @xmath38 singlet scalar field , @xmath39 is the @xmath38 levi - civita symbol , and the couplings are suppressed .",
    "the coupling @xmath40 is antisymmetric in @xmath41 .",
    "the sm lagrangian gives @xmath33 the lepton number @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 coupling defines @xmath44 for @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath45 coupling defines @xmath46 for @xmath36 .",
    "thus the above lagrangian does not violate the @xmath0 number .",
    "but @xmath0 can be broken by the vacuum expectation value(s ) of the @xmath0 carrying neutral higgs field(s ) .",
    "indeed , there exist one such component in this theory , the neutral element of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 breaks @xmath0 spontaneously , and this theory predicts a goldstone boson .",
    "neutrinos obtain mass at one loop - level , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that fig .",
    "1 includes all the couplings and the vev needed to break @xmath0 as discussed above . to give the goldstone boson a mass",
    ", the lagrangian should violate the lepton number explicitly .",
    "it can be done by introducing @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "then the neutrinos get masses through the two - loop diagrams as in fig . 2 even with @xmath50 .",
    "in any case , the diagonal elements of the mass matrix vanish .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of the model has been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "one simple feature is that the neutrino mass matrix has vanishing diagonal elements in the flavor basis , which can lead to a nontrivial prediction on the neutrino oscillation phenomenology .      in this section",
    ", we briefly comment on the roles of scalars(mainly the sleptons ) in the r - parity violating models @xcite .",
    "but for the baryon number conservation , we impose the baryon parity ( @xmath51-parity ) .",
    "then there exist the @xmath0 violating terms in the superpotential in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , [ lvsup ] _ i _ 2 _ i + 12_ijk _ i _ j",
    "^c_k + _ijk _ i _ j ^c_k .",
    "these interactions lead to the neutrino mass through the tree and one - loop level as shown in fig .  3 with the appropriate gaugino mass term @xmath52 and the soft terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in the tree level diagram ,",
    "the gaugino mass term and the gaugino interaction term with the neutrino and sneutrino are needed to define the appropriate lepton number of the sneutrino field .",
    "the gaugino mass mass term defines @xmath55 ; and hence @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath57 results from two insertions of @xmath58 . fig .",
    "3(a ) contains all these information .",
    "being the gauge interaction , the @xmath59 coupling is universal ( democratic ) , and the mass matrix arising from this diagram contains the common entry to every elements .",
    "thus , only one state obtain mass by fig .",
    "similarly , the loop diagrams present in fig .",
    "3(b)(c ) violate the lepton number and contribute to the neutrino masses . at one - loop level ,",
    "@xmath60 term and the mass term of the charged lepton ( down - type quark ) are needed to define the lepton numbers of the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 fields . in the case of @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) , the charged lepton mass term and @xmath65 term give @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this lepton number assignments leads to @xmath68 interactions through @xmath69 and @xmath70 interactions .",
    "this explains that why , at least , four kinds of interactions are involved to generate the majorana neutrino mass and the induced mass is proportional to the internal fermion mass and @xmath65 term .",
    "similar arguments can be applied for the case of @xmath71 case , viz .",
    "fig .  3 ( c ) .",
    "since the couplings appearing in these diagrams are the yukawa couplings , the mass matrix arising from the one - loop is quite general and all three neutrinos can obtain masses .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we study another interesting model , violating @xmath0 with scalars , singly charged @xmath73 and doubly charged @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this model is free from the problem of a goldstone boson since there is no extra neutral scalar field .",
    "we can generate the neutrino masses with just one singly charged scalar @xmath74 and one doubly charged scalar @xmath72 .",
    "then the resulting neutrino mass matrix is not general enough , and hence we introduce an additional singly charged scalar @xmath75 where @xmath76 or 2 , @xmath77 is the family number index @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the @xmath38 singlet charged anti - lepton field . in a theory with only one singly charged @xmath38 singlet scalar , we have @xmath80 only .",
    "note that we introduced an @xmath38 singlet doubly charged scalar @xmath72 .",
    "note that coupling matrix @xmath81 is an antisymmetric matrix and @xmath82 is symmetric .",
    "the @xmath83 coupling defines the @xmath0 number for @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 coupling defines the @xmath0 number for @xmath72 as @xmath87 .",
    "but the @xmath88 coupling defines the @xmath0 number of @xmath72 as @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the interaction terms give inconsistent @xmath0 numbers of @xmath72 , i.e. the lagrangian does not respect the @xmath0 symmetry . since @xmath0 is not a symmetry of @xmath89 , neutrino masses can arise at higher orders , here at a two - loop level .",
    "at least the two - loop as shown in fig .",
    "4 is needed to include @xmath90 and @xmath88 couplings , which are the requisite for the violation of @xmath0 . because @xmath0 is explicitly broken in the lagrangian",
    ", there does not exist a goldstone boson in this model .    from the above lagrangian and fig .",
    "4 , we estimate the two - loop neutrino mass as ( m_^2-loop)_im _ a , b , j , k_^jkf^a_ijf^b_mk , [ newnm ] where @xmath91 denotes the mass of the charged lepton and we assume @xmath92 is heavier than @xmath93 .",
    "this two - loop neutrino mass matrix is symmetric in flavor basis if @xmath94 is symmetric .",
    "this means that only the symmetric part of @xmath94 contributes the majorana neutrino mass . from now on ,",
    "we assume @xmath94 is symmetric .",
    "now , let s estimate the size of @xmath95 of eq .",
    "( [ newnm ] ) .",
    "( m_^2-loop)_im 0.5 _ a , b , j , k_^jkf^a_ijf^b_mk ( ) ( ) ( ) ^2 kev .",
    "for example , neglecting the electron mass and assuming universal @xmath82 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the neutrino mass matrix is m_^2-loop 2_ f^2 (    ccc 1 + 2 r_+r_^2 & 1+r _ & r_+r_^2 + 1+r _ & 1 & r _ + r_+r_^2 & r _ & r_^2    ) kev , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath83 denote the universal values of @xmath100 and @xmath97 , respectively , and the normalization factor @xmath101 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to explain the large mixing between @xmath5 and @xmath8 with universal @xmath97 and @xmath100 .",
    "the hierarchies between @xmath97 s and @xmath100 s are needed to accommodate the large mixing angle solution of @xmath5 for the atmospheric neutrino data .    since the large ( 1,1 ) component of @xmath102 is not desirable to explain the deficit of @xmath5 in super kamiokande data as oscillation of @xmath103 @xcite , we need tunings between couplings @xmath100 s and @xmath104 s .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath82 s as universal parameters . to suppress the large ( 1,1 ) component of @xmath102 ,",
    "we require the following relations between couplings : ^23_ & & ,   ^22_r_^n ,   ^33_= -2 r _ , + f_12&&-f / r _ ,   f_13=-f / r _ ,   f_23f g , [ result ] where we take @xmath105 as positive integer and neglect the electron mass .",
    "note that @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ". then , the mass matrix is given by m_^2-loop 2 f^2 g (    ccc r_^n / g & 1 & 1+r_^n+1 + 1 & -2 r _ g & -r _ g + 1+r_^n+1&-r _ g & r_^n+2 g    ) kev .",
    "with this mass matrix , we obtain for @xmath108 (    c _ e + _ + _    ) (    ccc -+ & + & - + + & - & - + - & + &    ) (    c _ 1 + _ 2 + _ 3    ) , with m_1 ^ 2&&(2f^2 g)^2 ( 2 + 2 g r _ )",
    "kev^2 , + m_2 ^ 2&&(2f^2 g)^2 ( 2 - 2 g r _ )  kev^2 , + m_3 ^ 2&=&0 , the mixing matrix and eigenvalues are independent of @xmath105 if @xmath109 up to @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , to give @xmath111 , the combination of the couplings and mass parameters satisfies the relation f^2 g ( 0.8 - 2.7 ) 10 ^ -5 , and m_sol^2=|m_2 ^ 2-m_1 ^ 2|=2m_atm g r _ ( 0.8 - 9.5 ) 10 ^ -5 ( ) ev^2 .",
    "we observe that this model can explain the atmospheric neutrino data and accomodate the large angle msw resolution of the solar neutrino data .",
    "now let us consider the phenomenological constraints on @xmath83 s and @xmath88 s .",
    "the current experimental data of the muon decay @xmath112 and radiative decay @xmath113 , whose constraints @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , are not enough to determine these parameters @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 come from the tau decay @xmath120 and radiative decay @xmath121 .",
    "the decay @xmath120 can be described by the following four - fermion effective lagrangian induced by the doubly charged boson exchange ( after appropriate fiertz transformation ) : |e_k^p_r e_i |e_l _",
    "since the doubly charged scalar interacts only with the right  handed charged leptons , the effective lagrangian has @xmath122 form . from this effective lagrangian",
    "we obtain @xcite , ( 3 ) ( _ e |_e ) ( ) ^2 . where @xmath123 is the fermi coupling constant . from the upper bound on the decay mode @xmath124 and",
    "the branching ratio @xmath125 @xcite , we obtain 1.3 10 ^ -2 g_f .",
    "this constraints can be easily satisfied without affecting the results from the neutrino data if , for example , we take large enough @xmath105 even with @xmath126 , viz .",
    "( [ result ] ) .",
    "for @xmath121 through the one  loop diagram with the doubly charged scalar @xcite , ( ) ( _ e |_e ) ( ) ^2 . from the upper bound on the decay mode",
    "@xmath121 @xcite and using the eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) , 2.4 g_f .",
    "this allows @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , there are no significant constraints on @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 at present .",
    "but the product of couplings @xmath127 , and @xmath128 must satisfy the relation  ( 17 ) .",
    "we studied a neutrino mass generating model with a doubly charged scalar @xmath72 and singly charged scalars @xmath129 .",
    "this has been motivated from the observation that the neutrino mixing angles are large , which is not easily incorporated in the see - saw mechanism . in this study",
    ", we emphasized the importance of the consideration of the lepton number @xmath0 .",
    "however , the parameters introduced in this model through eq .  ( 9 ) are restricted as eq .  ( 17 ) to explain @xmath130 .",
    "this constraint is not very strong since it is a constraint on the product of four coupling constants .",
    "generalizing the doubly charged scalar idea to gut models such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 may not be easy .",
    "however , it is not impossible .",
    "for example , it can be introduced in higher dimensional representations which couple to @xmath133 of @xmath131 . in an @xmath134 model",
    ", one can introduce a singlet which is charged . in this case",
    ", one does not need high dimensional representations .",
    "however , the gut inclusion of a doubly charged scalar field is premature to study at present , without a detailed knowledge of light particles below the gut scale .",
    "distinguishing the doubly charged scalar idea from the see - saw mechanism can be achieved from the study of rare processes occurring through the exchange of the doubly charged scalars as studied in this paper .",
    "also , if its mass is below the threshold of future accelerators , it can be easily identified through its decay to four leptons , @xmath135 .",
    "while we were finishing this manuscript , we received a preprint by joshipura and rindani @xcite considering the neutrino masses and mixings in a zee model extended by the doubly charged scalar field . in this model ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix of this model has contributions from both one and two  loop diagrams because the model has one more sm @xmath136 doublet comparing with the model considered in sec .",
