    "the study of @xmath1  theory at finite temperature is of great interest for a wide field of applications .",
    "a self  interacting scalar field serving as a simple model for the higgs particle in the standard model of electroweak interactions may allow the study of symmetry changing phase transitions .",
    "in fact , the order of the electroweak phase transition plays a crucial rle in the framework of cosmological scenarios as well as for the badly understood process of baryogenesis @xcite . despite the simplicity of the model , one may at least hope to gain some insight in the mechanism of the phase transition .",
    "moreover , the theory is a suitable test ground for analytic non  perturbative methods , e.g. variational methods @xcite as well as for lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "high temperature symmetry restoration in a spontaneously broken theory was already noted by kirzhnits and linde @xcite and worked out quantitatively subsequently @xcite . the convenient tool to study the behavior of the theory turns out to be the effective potential .",
    "whereas the critical temperature is already determined by the one loop potential and thus relatively simple to find , the order of the phase transition depends on the detailed shape of the potential which requires also the analysis of higher loop contributions , even for small coupling constant",
    ".    in particular , one finds , quantizing the theory around the classical non  trivial minimum that the one loop self  energy at high temperature behaves like @xmath2 , independent of external momenta and the value of the classical minimum .",
    "thus , for large @xmath3 the thermal mass dominates over the tree - level mass and the minimum of the effective action becomes the trivial one .",
    "the theory exhibits two important features : non  temperature stable vacuum and effective temperature dependent mass .",
    "it was consequently proposed @xcite to move the tree level mass into the interaction part and to start perturbation theory with the free lagrangian @xmath4 including a yet undetermined mass parameter @xmath5 .",
    "then one calculates the effective potential and fixes the parameter by the principle of minimal sensitivity @xmath6 .",
    "a more systematic approach of a self  consistent loop expansion was developed already some time ago by cornwall , jackiw , and tomboulis ( cjt ) in their effective action formalism for composite operators @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce a bilocal mass operator in the generating functional instead of the local mass @xmath5 .",
    "then one defines the generalized effective action @xmath7 as the double legendre transform of the generating functional which is now not only a functional of the expectation value of the field but also depends on the expectation value of the time  ordered product @xmath8 .",
    "the principle of minimal sensitivity gets replaced by the the so  called gap ",
    "equation @xmath9 which is employed to eliminate the exact two  point green function @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is dedicated to investigate on the solution of the gap ",
    "equation beyond the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "whereas the latter amounts to simply include only a local mass term in the ansatz for the green function @xcite , thus being a slightly more elegant reformulation of the variational approaches mentioned above , we will consistently @xcite include also the non - local contribution appearing in a spontaneously broken theory .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we split the inverse green function into a local mass term absorbing the usually resummed graphs , and a non - local self  energy part . by this ansatz , the gap ",
    "equation is recast into a non  linear integral equation for the self  energy , which we solve approximately by a suitably chosen ansatz .",
    "self consistency requires the unknown mass parameter to satisfy an effective - mass equation , the latter differing from the one found for the effective mass in the superdaisy resummation by an additional term which dominates in the limit of vanishing mass parameter .",
    "we discuss the behavior of the mass parameter near the critical temperature .",
    "we lay great emphasis on dealing with the divergencies correctly .",
    "it is useful to briefly review the basic steps in the construction of the generalized effective action for a classical action @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one starts with the generating functional in euclidean space ",
    "time @xmath12\\ ] ] and @xmath13 .",
    "after defining the classical field @xmath14 and the green function @xmath10 by @xmath15 one performs a legendre transformation to find the generalized effective action @xmath16 where @xmath17 at the r.h.s .",
    "have to be taken at the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) . from the above definition ,",
    "one immediately deduces the inverse relations @xmath18 the last equation tells us that if one wants back the standard effective action defined by @xmath19 one has to impose the so  called gap  equation @xmath20 in order to give a series expansion of @xmath21 we define the functional operator @xmath22 and one finds @xmath23 @xmath24 being the free propagator derived from the part of the action which is quadratic in the fields .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 contains all two  loop contributions and higher and has to be calculated as follows : shift the field @xmath26 in the classical action by @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath28 contains terms cubic and higher in @xmath26 which define the vertices .",
    "@xmath29 is given by all two - particle - irreducible vacuum graphs with the given set of vertices and the propagators replaced by @xmath10 .",
    "equation reads @xmath30",
    "the self  energy graphs we are going to resum are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "although the non  local contribution fig .  1b is formally of order @xmath32 it contributes to order @xmath33 in the false vacuum since already the tree ",
    "level value of the expectation value of the field is @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the three ",
    "vertex @xmath35 is of order @xmath36 which means that in the case of a spontaneously broken theory the non  local contribution ( b ) is as important as the local one ( a ) .",
    "we will show that this is also true at finite temperature .",
    "thus , the hartree  fock approximation involving only the local graph which corresponds to the superdaisy resummation at finite temperature is incomplete . including the non  local graph fig .",
    "1b in the self  energy , the gap  equation in fourier ",
    "space reads    @xmath37    where we use imaginary time formalism with @xmath38 .",
    "the first sum / integral corresponding to graph ( a ) does not depend on external momenta and energies and thus can be treated as mass term . we employ the ansatz @xmath39 and subsequently absorb all local contributions in the mass parameter @xmath40 which has to be determined self  consistently afterwards . plugging ( [ ans1 ] ) into ( [ 5 ] ) , the gap ",
    "equation transforms into an equation for @xmath41 , @xmath42 simple power counting now reveals that the expression involving the integration is logarithmic divergent for large momenta @xmath43 . to isolate these divergencies ,",
    "we subtract and add a term of the form @xmath44 which in the high temperature @xmath45 limit evaluates to @xmath46 where we introduced a uv  cutoff @xmath47 .",
    "the difference between the last summand in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and the subtraction ( [ subtr ] ) is a uv  finite quantity . consequently , in the high temperature limit",
    ", we are allowed to pick only the zero  mode in the thermal sum in the difference ( [ 6 ] ) - ( [ subtr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath48 contribution of the subtraction exactly cancels the first term in ( [ diva ] ) , leaving us with @xmath49 as divergent part of the r.h.s .  of the gap  equation ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "it is now possible to absorb the logarithmic divergence in the mass renormalization and we choose the parameter @xmath40 such that @xmath50 which renders the self  energy @xmath51 in equation ( [ 6 ] ) a finite quantity .",
    "furthermore , one may simplify equation ( [ 6 ] ) by considering the @xmath52 mode of the self ",
    "energy only since the non  static modes are at least suppressed by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "thus putting @xmath54 we end with the integral equation @xmath55 where we introduced the dimensionless quantities @xmath56 and the parameter @xmath57",
    "without going in the details of solving ( [ 7a ] ) one can already make some useful statements about the behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "firstly , the denominator of ( [ 7a ] ) is a positive definite quantity , thus @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the solution is bound , i.e. @xmath60 , the denominator may be estimated form below ( above ) by @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively . carrying out the integration on the r.h.s .  in ( [ 7a ] )",
    ", one finds the following bounds for @xmath63 @xmath64 which in turn determine the asymptotic behavior , @xmath65 .",
    "secondly , we note that due to the z  integration , odd powers of z vanish in the integrand , which in particular means that @xmath66    using this property and the asymptotic behavior , we are already able to approximate @xmath67 by a suitably chosen function . due to the non ",
    "local character of the integral equation , however , we have to know the function @xmath67 for all momenta even if we were only interested in the low momentum behavior of the self  energy .",
    "consequently , each kind of series ansatz is not a clever choice since it can never exhibit both , the correct small momentum behavior and the large @xmath68 limit .",
    "we thus employ a pad ( rational function ) approximation which will turn out to be a remarkably good global approximation for @xmath69 . the simplest ansatz consistent with @xmath70 and",
    "the asymptotic behavior reads @xmath71 and @xmath72 are functions of @xmath73 which we have to determine such that the approximation fits as well as possible the true solution .    from the form of the denominators in the integrand ( [ 7a ] ) it is evident , that @xmath74 contributes most to the integral for small values of @xmath75 since for large values of @xmath75 , @xmath76",
    "being a decreasing function is neglectable compared with @xmath77 .",
    "for this reason we choose the ansatz such that ( [ 7a ] ) is fulfilled exactly for @xmath78 and @xmath79 . plugging ( [ ans ] ) into the integral equation , one could  at least in principle  carry out the integration which results in two complicated transcendental equations for @xmath80 which have to be solved numerically anyway .",
    "we , however , will not do so , but merely discuss the limits @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out ( see appendix ) that for large values of @xmath83 , the coefficients exhibit a power law behavior , namely @xmath84 with the constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for small @xmath73",
    "we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "values between the small @xmath83 and large @xmath83 region can be found by numerical integration , see also the table given in the appendix . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the approximation ( [ ans ] ) with the exact one found by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ 7a ] ) .    the solution for @xmath76 may further serve to eliminate the parameter @xmath89 as defined in ( [ 5 ] ) , which amounts to evaluate the trace of the propagator , @xmath90 where as before",
    ", we have to extract the uv  divergent part prior to be able to make the static approximation @xmath91 in the sum . again subtracting and adding the uv  dominant contribution @xmath92 ( [ 8a ] ) - ( [ sub99 ] ) is a uv  finite quantity , and we are thus allowed to drop all modes except for the zero  mode in the thermal sum .",
    "the difference may be expressed by the function @xmath93 which can be calculated analytically using the approximation for @xmath76 together with the known parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "we mention that , as before , also this function exhibits a power law behavior for large values of the parameter @xmath73 , @xmath96 , and goes like @xmath97 for small @xmath83 . finally , putting together the definition of @xmath89 with the condition ( [ 2a ] )",
    ", one can transform the gap  equation ( [ 5 ] ) into an equation for the mass parameter @xmath40 , @xmath98 which is nevertheless meaningless until we absorb the divergent contributions @xmath99 in a redefinition of the bare quantities @xmath100 and @xmath27 .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath0theory is delicate task @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that carrying out the limit in the regularization parameter , the theory in fact becomes trivial in the sense that the renormalized coupling constant vanishes . for our purposes , however , it is more adequate to keep the cut  off large but finite , since we want to study @xmath101theory only as a model for the higgs . consequently , we express the quantities @xmath102 in redefined ones , but keep in mind the eventual limit @xmath103 .",
    "we regroup the corresponding terms ( [ gap1 ] ) in the following  admittedly suggestive  way @xmath104 and expect that in the renormalized equation , the coupling constant @xmath33 gets replaced by the renormalized one @xmath105 in the rightmost term . multiplying",
    "the whole equation by @xmath106 suggests the following identifications @xmath107 since we have only calculated to order @xmath33 we are free to neglect terms @xmath108 which have to be fixed by higher order loop calculations .",
    "thus the equation for @xmath27 may be recast in the more convenient form @xmath109 which reveals an essential fact . from this equation and the redefinition of the coupling constant @xmath33 in ( [ rengl ] ) we find immediately that @xmath110 and consequently @xmath111 . the invariance of @xmath83 under the redefinitions is important for the solutions of the gap  equation . as opposed to this , if @xmath83 had a non ",
    "trivial scaling with a divergent quantity , the integral equation would have only the physically uninteresting solutions for @xmath112 or @xmath113 in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "finally we are able to reexpress the gap ",
    "equation for the mass parameter in terms of the redefined quantities , @xmath114",
    "the mass equation ( [ gap2 ] )  together with the known function @xmath115  may be used to determine the effective mass parameter @xmath40 for a given value @xmath116 .",
    "first we note that the contribution @xmath115 entirely comes from the resummation of the second graph in fig .  1 .",
    "for small values of the parameter @xmath83 , the additional term can be neglected with respect to @xmath117 . on the other hand ,",
    "for large values of @xmath83 which in the non  trivial vacuum @xmath118 means small @xmath40 , due to the large @xmath83 behavior of @xmath119 , the mass parameter cancels out in the next to leading order contribution in equation ( [ gap2 ] ) and we are left with a term @xmath120 .",
    "we emphasize that this term is an important contribution near the critical temperature @xmath121 because it takes on a non  vanishing value for @xmath122 .",
    "in particular , expressed in orders of @xmath105 , since @xmath123 one finds @xmath124 which is of the same order as the term @xmath125 and thus crucial at the critical temperature where the leading term @xmath126 in ( [ gap2 ] ) vanish .    due to this behavior the mass  equation does not necessarily have a real solution for all values @xmath116 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath127 no solutions exists for @xmath128 . for temperatures between @xmath129 and @xmath130 ,",
    "the solution consists of two disconnected branches which join for @xmath131 to give a solution for all values of @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    the mass parameter may be interpreted physically as a kind of ultraviolet mass appearing in the propagator ( [ ans1 ] ) since the self  energy vanishes for large momenta .",
    "as opposed to this , in the infrared region @xmath132 the self  energy does have the non  vanishing limit @xmath133 which contributes to the mass in the propagator .",
    "the corresponding effective masses are shown in fig .",
    "we have solved the gap  equation consistently to lowest order for a spontaneously broken theory .",
    "it turns out , that the hartree ",
    "fock approximation corresponding to superdaisy resummation fails to be consistent . instead , for small effective mass",
    ", we encountered an additional contribution in the gap  equation which behaves like @xmath134 which can not be found in a perturbative calculation .",
    "this contribution of course alters the effective propagator and consequently the corresponding effective potential .",
    "since it is exactly the region of small mass which is of crucial importance for the behavior of a theory near the phase transition , we expect significant changes in the transition of field configurations from the false to the trivial vacuum and vice versa .",
    "we plan to clarify this point in a forthcoming investigation .",
    "the conditions imposed to determine @xmath80 are that equation ( [ 7a ] ) is fulfilled exactly for @xmath135 and @xmath136 . from the first condition ,",
    "we find , putting the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) into ( [ 7a ] ) @xmath137 the functions @xmath80 can be approximated consistently for large values of @xmath83 by a simple power law , @xmath138 . to see this explicitly",
    ", we plug the assumed behavior into equation ( [ ah1 ] ) and rescale the momentum by @xmath139 which transforms the denominator @xmath140 into @xmath141 for large values of @xmath83 we neglect 1 with respect to the term containing @xmath142 .",
    "thus the integral becomes proportional to @xmath143 which is consistent with the power  behavior of @xmath144 and ( [ ah1 ] ) takes the form @xmath145 similarly , from the second condition for @xmath146 , one finds @xmath147 @xmath148 the set of equations ( [ ah2],[ah3 ] ) can be solved numerically for the constants @xmath149 , and we find @xmath150             e.  w.  kolb and m.  s.  turner , _ the early universe _ , ( addison  wesley , reading , ma , 1990 ) ; a.  g.  cohen , d.  b.  kaplan and a.  e.  nelson , annu .",
