    "elliptic flow of identified hadrons is sensitive to the hydrodynamical radial expansion of the medium .",

    "is expected to exhibit similar mass scaling and additionally it is expected to be a sensitive probe for the viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath4 of the created medium @xcite . the measurement of identified particle @xmath3 can therefore provide a constraint on @xmath4 after more detailed theoretical calculations become available for lhc energies .",

    "the purity was estimated to be better than @xmath8 at @xmath9 for pions and kaons and at @xmath10 for protons . in order to reduce the contamination from non - primary particles the reconstructed particles were required to have a distance of closest approach to the primary vertex of less than 1 mm .",
