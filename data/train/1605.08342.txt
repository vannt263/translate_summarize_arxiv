    "the possibility that ellipticals form by mergers of two or more pre - existing galaxies , typically discs , was first suggested by @xcite as an alternative to the top - down monolithic collapse hypothesis @xcite .",
    "that was some years before cosmological observations start to point heavily to a world model in which galaxies form within an underlying structure built up hierarchically through the collapse and subsequent merger of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes .",
    "it was precisely this generic feature of cdm models , the continuous bottom - up growth of structure in all scales  nearly unabated until recently ( @xmath0 ) when the universe has entered a phase of dark energy domination ",
    ", that provided important clues to alleviate the first objections raised by early simulations of the merger scenario . in those days , numerical models mostly focused on pairwise collisions of similar stellar discs , producing remnants that rotated too fast and had ellipticities that were too large to represent true massive ellipticals .",
    "the addition of an extended cdm component around the colliding galaxies facilitated the transfer of the orbital angular momentum deposited in the discs along the merger to the common dark halo , thus reducing the rotation speed of the final stellar remnant to values consistent with observations .",
    "moreover , it soon became clear that understanding the formation of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) demanded repeated mergers of progenitors covering a wide range of masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "multiple merging led to the formation of oblate - triaxial , and therefore more rounder - looking , remnants @xcite .",
    "another important obstacle to the merger hypothesis is the necessity of building objects exhibiting central light distributions more concentrated that those of their most likely progenitors .",
    "as stated by @xcite , the macroscopic phase space densities of the cores of intermediate- and low - luminosity elliptical galaxies are found to generally exceed the phase space densities measured in galactic discs . since according to liouville s theorem the phase space probability in a dynamically reversible system",
    "must be kept constant , this argues against the formation of the bulk of the elliptical population via collisionless mergers of stellar discs , a point also stressed by @xcite soon after the merger hypothesis was formulated . to overcome this problem",
    "@xcite suggested dealing with mergers of spirals that either include a high - mass density spheroidal component ( e.g.  a bulge ) , or are largely gaseous and thus capable of introducing irreversibility in the system by effectively dissipating part of the energy deposited into the core . the fact that the central space densities of ellipticals depend strongly on luminosity ( @xmath1 as estimated by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) turned dissipative merging into an alternative that was worth exploring .    using a large suite of simulations of equal - mass mergers of discs , both with and without gas , @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showed that dissipation imprints a mass - dependent relation in the ratio of total mass to stellar mass of the remnants of the form @xmath2 this relationship arises from the halo mass dependence of the cooling efficiency of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) collisionally heated during the merger . in gas - rich low - mass systems",
    "the hot intergalactic gas cools rapidly producing inflows giving rise to a central merger induced starburst that is compact .",
    "however , in a wet merger between two large spirals the igm can not cool efficiently and remains in the halo for the duration of the merger , causing more massive galaxies to act increasingly as dissipationless systems .",
    "this produces low- and intermediate - mass final remnants that are more baryon dominated in their central regions than their more massive counterparts , giving rise to a dependence of the form  ( [ mmstar ] ) with @xmath3 small ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) but positive , as found in some observational studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is straightforward to show , provided @xmath6 , that equation  ( [ mmstar ] ) can be transformed into the power - law relation @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 the projected radius of the system , @xmath10 its line - of - sight velocity dispersion and @xmath11 an index measuring the `` tilt '' relative to the standard plane , @xmath12 , that arises when one assumes for virialized remnants baryon fraction invariance and structural and dynamical homology .",
    "the most useful version of equation  ( [ fpt ] ) is none the less a generalization that accounts for either nonhomology , or variations in the the stellar mass fraction , or both , and that replaces @xmath13 by a directly measurable property such as the surface brightness @xmath14 .",
    "if we transform this new expression by dividing it by @xmath15 and taking logarithms , solving for @xmath9 we get @xmath16 in this case the tilt is expressed in slope coefficients that differ from the standard values : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "equation  ( [ logfp ] ) defines what is known as the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies , a scaling between the three global properties of mass  implicit in the stellar surface brightness  , size , and velocity dispersion ( or specific internal energy ) that shape up the pivotal space ( hereafter the @xmath19 space ) in which to study galaxies of all kinds ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". introduced by @xcite and @xcite as a precise distance indicator for etgs , the widely studied fp of ellipticals combines the two well - known 2d @xcite @xmath20@xmath10 relation ( fjr ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath9@xmath14 relation @xcite into a 3d scaling in @xmath19 space with a yet more reduced scatter ( @xmath21 dex in the perpendicular direction ) .",
    "both the tilt and tightness of this plane are used as powerful constraints on theoretical models of etg formation .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that for sufficiently high gas fractions ( @xmath22 ) the remnants of pairwise mergers can yield a simulated fp with nearly the same tilt ( @xmath23 ) observed in the nir .",
    "in the same way , gas - rich dissipational simulations produce model @xmath9@xmath24 relations with a slope ( @xmath25 ) that compares well with the relation measured for nearby etgs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that is fully consistent with the formula  ( [ lambda ] ) given the previously quoted values of @xmath26 and @xmath3",
    ". further analysis of these sort of simulations by @xcite and @xcite showed that an increase in the gas fraction produced remnants progressively more oblate and rounder , that rotate faster and that , in general , match far better than their dissipationless counterparts the 1d and 2d structural and kinematic properties of @xmath27 of the nearby etgs observed in integral - field spectroscopic surveys @xcite .",
    "however , the same dissipational merger simulations that successfully reproduced the observed properties of low- and intermediate - mass ellipticals , had trouble explaining the formation of luminous , non - rotating spheroids , with old stars , shallow cusps and boxy isophotes , which make the remaining @xmath28 of the local etg population @xcite . on the other hand , now a growing body of evidence , both theoretical ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and observational ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicates that the mass growth of the largest ellipticals , especially the brightest members of groups and clusters , is quite likely driven by a sequence of ( gradually minor ) dissipationless mergers , the role of gas being restricted at most to very early epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more interesting still , is the fact that first - ranked galaxies define essentially the same fp of their less massive counterparts , although with an even smaller scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this reduced dispersion is also in agreement with a dry merger formation history .",
    "all these findings are consistent with the idea , advanced many years before by @xcite and @xcite , that the importance of gas during the merger process declines with galaxy mass .",
    "this hypothesis , which @xcite embodied in the concept of _ merging continuum _ , seems none the less to be in conflict with the outcome of most galaxy merger experiments .",
    "in many of these simulations the tilt of the fp is exclusively driven by gas dissipation , with the role of gravity being limited to the preservation of the slope created by the gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this were the case , then the tilted fp of first - ranked galaxies in the local universe , which as observations suggest are essentially composed of very old stars ( formed at @xmath29 ) , would be a legacy from at least @xmath30 billion years ago .",
    "we believe that the root of the problem is that , as mentioned before , both dry and wet pre - prepared merger simulations have traditionally focused on binary collisions , recreating merger hierarchies at best throughout two or three non - overlapping merger steps which use the remnants of the previous one to realize the initial conditions of the next @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear that these idealizations of multiple merging are only gross descriptions of the diversity , in terms of frequencies and mass ratios , of galaxy interactions that shape the brightest etgs in the course of cosmic evolution .",
    "pending the study of large sets of brightest members of galaxy systems through full cosmological simulations becomes computationally afordable , the best approach to investigate the assembly and properties of such objects by means of cosmologically - consistent merger histories is nowadays through controlled experiments of aggregations of multiple galaxies undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "it is important to focus on groups of galaxies rather than on pairs , because of the necessity of building a dense environment in which galaxies are prone to suffer numerous collisions , whilst dynamically - young small - size overdensities provide a framework in which both the frequency and strength of interactions , and therefore the merger likelihood , are maximized . to our knowledge , the only investigation on the role of gravitational dynamics in the formation of massive etgs conducted along these lines is the recent work by @xcite . by studying collapsing groups of three to twenty - five disc galaxies spanning a range of masses",
    ", these authors have demonstrated that multiple dry merging is certainly a plausible route for the formation of the most massive ellipticals . in particular , @xcite have shown that hierarchical sequences of dissipationless mergers of spiral galaxies can produce first - ranked objects obeying a significantly tilted fp , although somewhat less strongly than observations suggest . in the same way , they have found that this scenario results in exceptionally tight 2d and 3d relationships between the most important physical properties of central remnants .    in the next section",
    ", we present a similar experiment to that of @xcite , based on controlled high - resolution numerical simulations of the previrialization stage of isolated groups of galaxies , which produces even more striking outcomes regarding the origin of the fp defined by the most massive members of galaxy aggregations ( sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .",
    "our set - up is somewhat more elaborated than theirs in certain aspects .",
    "the main differences in our approach  in which the key of our better performance appears to lie  are : the simultaneous inclusion of late- and early - type galaxy models to account for the expected mix of progenitors populations ; the non - homologous scaling of the progenitors global properties ; the inclusion of a common dark matter background within which galaxies are randomly distributed ; and the scaling of the progenitors dark halo masses to values appropriate for the initial redshift of the simulation , which is also significantly higher ( @xmath31 vs @xmath32 ) .",
    "by contrast , we are more restrictive than @xcite in terms of the range of both the initial membership and total masses of the simulated groups , which we fix to specific typical values ( see below ) . in no case",
    "this latter constraint undermines the conclusions of the present work .",
    "as part of a broader project aimed at studying galaxy merging in a realistic context , we have developed a high - resolution @xmath33-body model of a forming aggregation of galaxies which is a good and computationally competitive approximation to pure cosmological experiments .",

    "each group region contains initially @xmath47 non  overlapping extended galaxy haloes .",
    "the total ( virial ) masses of this individual haloes , which obey a navarro - frenk - white density profile , are randomly drawn from a schechter probability distribution function ( pdf ) of asymptotic slope @xmath48 and characteristic mass @xmath49 .",

    "the stellar cores , however , are left unchanged given that in our experiments most mergers take place at a relatively late epoch in which the properties of galaxies are rather similar to those in the local volume .",
    "once all the galactic haloes of a given group have been generated and rescaled , the common uniform background of the group is evenly filled with dm particles ( identical to those that make the individual haloes ) until a total group mass ( dark plus luminous ) of @xmath66 is reached .",
    "the initial positions of background particles ( including the centre of mass of member galaxies ) are randomly distributed inside the group volume , while their initial velocities follow the local hubble flow .",
    "a total of 48 groups have been created following the procedure just described . in order to compare mock and real data ,",
    "we have projected the 3d spatial information contained in the final snapshot of each run on to the three cartesian planes and , after adding a minimum sky background to all images , smoothed them with an isotropic kernel .",
    "we then have used the software sextractor @xcite to build a catalog of group members .",
    "the global properties of the brightest group galaxies ( bggs ) and of its lesser companions have been calculated from the three independent projected final images resulting from each simulation .",
    "this has allowed us to triple the sample size , offering at the same time a crude but useful information on the variance in the simulated data arising from object identification , projection effects and contamination by foreground companions .",
    "further details on the description of the methodology adopted to process our simulations can be found elsewhere ( @xcite ) .    for each group",

    ". the fp delineated by our simulated remnants matches perfectly well not just the mean tilt , but also the normalization of the relatively narrow , flat 3-space region defined by the observations , all without requiring that progenitor galaxies have gas .",
    "this can be better visualized in fig .",
    "[ figu_2 ] which compares the predicted values for each variable defining the inferred fp with the actual measurements .",
    "the lack of a clear non - random structure in the distribution of residuals is a sign that the model fp fits all the observations well .",
    "a collateral result of this analysis is the identification of a set of completely independent databases of giant ellipticals with fully compatible measurements despite the not too insignificant differences which affect the selection and treatment of the data .",
    "this comes on top of recent claims that the fp of massive galaxies does not vary with environment , redshift or even star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "the successful reproduction of the tilted fp relation is in sharp contrast with former dissipationless merger experiments that , with a few exceptions @xcite , have systematically produced remnants which occupy a fp similar to that expected from virialized homologous systems . to our knowledge ,",
    "ours is the most accurate experimental prediction of this basic relationship , regarding both its three coefficients and its reduced thickness , ever inferred from a numerical simulation of any kind aimed at studying the formation of the most massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "another notable feature of the fp is that different classes of giant etgs occupy distinctive areas on its surface , reflecting diversity in the structural and kinematic properties related to their respective formation histories @xcite .",
    "first - ranked galaxies are clearly segregated from the locus of the general population of giant ellipticals because of their considerably lower surface stellar mass density / brightness @xcite , whereas second - ranked objects lie on an intermediate position ",
    "being mindful that in simulations the recovering of galaxy properties degrades with decreasing brightness , we have found that mock galaxies with lower ranks depart progressively from the fp .",
    "calculation of the vectors defined by the most important physical processes ruling the formation of hot stellar systems ( energy dissipation , dissipationless mergers , mass loss through either supernova - driven winds or tidal and ram pressure stripping , etc ) in the full 3-space of the fp , have shown that they move galaxies within the plane far more than they move them out of it @xcite .",
    "this provides a plausible explanation for the remarkable fact that in said space the common manifold of giant etgs forms quite a slender sheet despite the strong stochasticity of the galaxy formation process .",
    "[ figu_2 ] also shows that the scatter around the fp is similarly connected to the etg class , becoming smaller for classes with more massive representatives ( this statement is reflected in quantitative terms in table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced scatter of @xcite s bcg data set , surpassed only by the even lower dispersion shown by our simulated galaxies , is another manifestation of the important regularity in the formation process of the most massive hot spheroids in the universe which , according to our experiments , can be driven by purely gravitational phenomena .",
    "the results outlined here , in harmony with other investigations of stochastic collisionless merging @xcite , demonstrate that this mechanism is perfectly capable of reproducing the tight local relations that show the most fundamental parameters of these systems .",
    "it appears then that a realistic merger hierarchy can naturally provide the conditions required to reproduce the small intrinsic scatter shown by the observed stellar - mass scaling laws of massive etgs without the need for a high degree of fine tuning between progenitors mass ratios and merger orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "in particular it should be noted that our progenitor galaxies have virial masses randomly drawn from a wide range of a schechter pdf and initial positions that are uniformly distributed inside the group volume .",
    "furthermore , the fact that we simulate groups that are in the making implies that their member galaxies move most of the time in a mean gravitational field that is widely fluctuating and erratic because of the violent relaxation of the parent system . as a result",
    ", the outcome of the mergers that take place in such a highly non - linear phase  more specifically , the statistical distribution of the properties of the remnants  gets largely detached from the initial orbital characteristics of progenitor galaxies .    ,",

    "data symbols are the same used in fig .",
    "[ figu_1 ] . in all panels the black diagonal line represents perfect agreement between real ( @xmath82 axis ) and estimated ( @xmath83 axis ) values .",
    "the reasonably neutral behaviour of the residuals confirms that the model fp fits the observations well .",
    "note that the samples containing the brightest objects , both simulated and observed , systematically show the smallest differences between expectations and measurements . ]",
    "[ figu_3 ]    the fact that all massive etgs fall into a single fp , coupled with the segregation of the highest - ranked objects from lesser galaxies , entails that any non - edge - on projection of this flat surface must also lead to segregated 2d scaling laws . to investigate this issue we now use @xmath24 to represent scale , shifting to the ( logarithmic ) @xmath19 coordinate system defined by the three most basic global parameters connected by the standard plane . in this manner",
    "we set the framework for the study of two of the most firmly established empirical scaling relations of elliptical galaxies : the @xcite - like @xmath84 relation @xcite and the @xmath85 relation , a mass analogue of the classical fjr . in good agreement with observational studies of bcg / bggs @xcite , we find that our simulated first - ranked galaxies lie off the standard 2d scaling relations defined by the bulk of the etg population .",
    "in particular , as shown in fig .  [ figu_3 ] , bggs are larger and have lower effective velocity dispersions than ordinary ellipticals of the same stellar mass . the combination of this latter result with the fact that light appears to be similarly concentrated for bggs than for non - bggs ( @xcite ) , tells us that the total mass - to - light fraction interior to @xmath58 is lower for the former than for the latter . our numerical experiments",
    ", however , do not seem to support claims of the steepening of the @xmath86 relation for cgs toward values @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "we find instead that our first - ranked objects , which occupy a locus moderately offset from the central axis of the observational data in fig .",
    "[ figu_3]a , are well fitted by a model with @xmath88 .",

    "differences in the photometry , the waveband of the observations , sample construction ( i.e.  incompletenesses and selection biases ) , and fitting methods would help explain the lack of a closer agreement between these results about the most robust of the 2d relationships .",
    "the different locations of massive and regular etgs along the fp also have a bearing on the zero point of the @xmath96 relation leaving , as in the previous case , the power law index hardly affected .",
    "the joint @xmath85 distribution ( fig .  [ figu_3]b ) evidences that our simulated first - ranked galaxies have excess stellar mass above the prediction of the standard fjr , defining a roughly parallel sequence @xmath97 mag brighter ( more massive ) whose upper boundary extends into the area occupied by the bcgs data .",
    "this large intercept offset implies that , while the @xmath84 relation is basically an edge - on projection of the mass fp , the baryonic fjr is definitely not . besides , it may also help to explain why the values of the slope of the fjr recovered from data sets that include a mix of bcgs and non - bcgs are considerably steeper than the canonical @xmath98 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the current case , we find @xmath99 from an orthogonal fit to the subset of our mock first - ranked galaxies .",
    "this value is consistent with most measurements reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "[ figu_3]c displays the joint distribution of @xmath58 and @xmath67 , which shows the fp almost face - on , providing a clear view of the almost non - existent correlation shown by these two variables  illustrating the general intransitivity of correlations  , as well as of the substantially different areas occupied by central and non - central etgs .",
    "this plot also best illustrates the moderate overlap shown by the point clouds corresponding to our simulated bggs and their observational counterparts .",
    "this discrepancy can be ascribed to the fact that our mock first - ranked galaxies probably represent the lowest - mass objects of its class  not all of them , for instance , are truly massive : @xmath100  since these are central remnants assembled in isolated small groups rather than in the considerably larger galaxy aggregations hosting the bulk of the observed cgs . indeed , as shown in the different panels of fig .",
    "[ figu_3 ] , the data points encircled in black corresponding to five of our largest simulated bggs ( the most fossil - like objects ) , as well as to the three cgs of the norma and coma clusters , fall squarely into the observed bcgs region ( big yellow dots )  although on opposing sides  , indicating that they all share similar characteristics .",
    "pending that we extend the present analysis to more massive galaxy aggregations , a good way to substantiate the proposed explanation is by taking advantage of the fact that our simulations are nominally scale - free , as long as our preferred transformations to physical units adopted in the initial setup continue to be acceptable .",
    "thus , we have used the standard @xmath101 scaling verified by virialized spherical systems to infer a rough estimate of the 2d correlations that are to be expected from our simulations when , for instance , the mass of the host units triples ( keeping @xmath102 constant ) . as depicted by fig .",
    "[ figu_4 ] , our predictions indicate that the global properties of simulated first - ranked galaxies of larger aggregations would match much better the volume occupied by @xcite s bcgs in @xmath19 space , showing a substantial overlap along all three projections .",

    "mainly qualitative in nature , we find that the joint distributions of size and stellar mass of both bgg samples show a very good statistical agreement , in the sense that @xcite s straight - line fits to their data also provide quite a reasonably good description of our point cloud ( fig .",
    "[ figu_3]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the other two relations involving the central velocity dispersion of galaxies show large offsets .",
    "the deviation is due to the fact that the intermediate-@xmath75 bggs have systematically higher values of @xmath67 ( at fixed @xmath24 or @xmath58 ) than their synthetic counterparts .",
    "it is , however , important to realise that the cgs in @xcite with a measured velocity dispersion constitute a magnitude - limited subset of the main sample .",
    "this biases their measurements against faint , low - stellar - mass objects , suggesting that the rescaled data from our figs .",
    "[ figu_4]b and c would perhaps allow a more proper comparison .",
    "when doing so , we find indeed a substantial improvement in the overall consistency of the dynamic ranges in size , velocity and mass from both samples .",
    "@xcite s study also brings out the fact that the late - time evolution of first - ranked galaxies eventually leads to changes in their global properties that largely involve a renormalization of the main 2d scaling laws that does not alter  or scarcely changes at worst  their slopes ( compare their figs .",

    "this behaviour , analogous to that of the mass rescaling applied to our bggs , suggests the stability of the fp with respect to the secular evolution of cgs properties , in good agreement with the theoretical predictions about the nature of this surface by @xcite and the observations by @xcite .",
    "controlled hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy merging indicate that dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the tilt of the fp of etgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this puts under strain observations of massive early - type objects claiming otherwise @xcite and therefore the conjecture , advanced for more than a few years now by @xcite and @xcite , that ellipticals as a group constitute a continuum of merger - dominated systems in which the importance of gas in the outcome declines with increasing galaxy mass .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that the merger hierarchy typical of @xmath39cdm cosmologies has been traditionally recreated in numerical experiments through a sequence of two or three non - overlapping major binary collisions of homologous systems that use the remnants of one step to realize the initial conditions of the next ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these idealizations of multiple merging can hardly capture the diversity of galaxy interactions that take place in the course of cosmic evolution , especially when it comes to the distribution of orbits , frequencies and mass ratios .",
    "in contrast , our cosmologically - consistent simulations of previrialized galaxy associations provide the most convincing evidence presented to date on the viability of hierarchical collisionless merging as a formation channel for first - ranked objects through the reproduction of their main global properties and correlations , leading therefore to the removal of the last remaining obstacle for the experimental validation of the merger continuum conjecture .",
