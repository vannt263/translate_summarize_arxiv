    "the aim of this paper is to prove the existence of a solution for the second order lagrangian system    @xmath8    where @xmath3 is a continuous positive bounded function , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , is a @xmath5-smooth potential satisfying the ambrosetti - rabinowitz superquadratic growth condition and @xmath6 is a continuous bounded square integrable forcing term .",
    "our intention is to generalise the following result by e. serra , m. tarallo and s. terracini from @xcite to the inhomogeneous systems .",
    "[ sttthm ] assume that    * @xmath10 , * there exists @xmath11 such that for all @xmath12 , @xmath13 * @xmath14 is almost periodic in the sense of bohr and @xmath15    then the problem @xmath16 has at least one nonzero solution .    here and subsequently",
    ", @xmath17 denotes the standard inner product in @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the induced norm .",
    "let us recall that a function @xmath20 is almost periodic in the sense of bohr if for every @xmath21 there is a finite linear combination of sine and cosine functions that is of distance less than @xmath22 from @xmath20 with respect to the supremum norm .",
    "the proof of theorem [ sttthm ] in @xcite is of variational nature , i.e. a solution is found as a critical point of a suitable functional .",
    "the lack of a group of symmetries for which the functional is invariant , which exists in the case of periodic potentials , is faced by a property of palais - smale sequences introduced by e. sr ( see @xcite ) and bochner s criterion of almost periodicity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider the inhomogeneous lagrangian systems .",
    "intuitively , if the forcing term @xmath23 in is sufficiently small , then a homoclinic type solution should exist simply because of the existence in the homogenous case .",
    "our main result affirms this and it also deals with the question how large the forcing term @xmath24 in can be :    [ cjwthm ] assume that    * @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 , * there exists @xmath11 such that for all @xmath12 , @xmath13 * @xmath14 and @xmath28 , * @xmath29 , * @xmath30",
    ".    then the inhomogenous lagrangian system has at least one homoclinic type solution .",
    "let us briefly discuss our assumptions in theorem [ cjwthm ] .",
    "condition @xmath31 is the superquadratic growth condition due to a. ambrosetti and p. rabinowitz @xcite . since @xmath32 has a global minimum at @xmath33 by @xmath31 , @xmath34 is more general than @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , it is readily seen by @xmath31 that for every @xmath36 the map @xmath37 is non - increasing , which yields the following inequalities : @xmath38 and @xmath39 as @xmath11 , the inequality implies that @xmath32 grows faster than @xmath40 at infinity .",
    "clearly , @xmath41 is more general than @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath41 and @xmath43 imply that @xmath20 is bounded , which , however , is also true for every almost periodic function in the sense of bohr .",
    "the last two conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are closely related .",
    "namely , the forcing term @xmath24 needs to be sufficiently small in @xmath45 , but the upper bound on the norm of @xmath24 depends on the restriction of the space variable of the potential @xmath46 to the unit sphere in @xmath18 .",
    "the study of homoclinic solutions for lagrangian systems has received much attention in recent years , especially when the potential is periodic in time .",
    "the existence problem of homoclinics has been widely investigated by variational methods , see for example in @xcite .",
    "existence results for perturbed systems were given in @xcite .",
    "our proof of theorem [ cjwthm ] is also of variational nature .",
    "let us point out , however , that it is quite different from serra , tarallo and terracini s proof of theorem [ sttthm ] in @xcite . here",
    ", we find a solution of as a limit in @xmath47 of a sequence @xmath48 , @xmath49 , obtained by an approximation scheme introduced by krawczyk in @xcite , where every @xmath50 is a critical point of a suitable functional @xmath51 that we introduce below .",
    "we now prove theorem [ cjwthm ] in the following section and we nicely round off the paper by two numerical examples in a final section .",
    "in what follows , we let @xmath52 be the sobolev space @xmath53 of @xmath54-functions on @xmath55 with values in @xmath18 equipped with the norm    @xmath56    for each @xmath57 , we denote by @xmath58 the sobolev space of @xmath7-periodic @xmath54-functions with the norm    @xmath59    then let @xmath60 be the space of @xmath7-periodic , essentialy bounded and measureable functions from @xmath55 into @xmath18 with the norm    @xmath61\\}.\\ ] ]    we note for later reference that    @xmath62    for all @xmath57 and @xmath63 ( cf .",

    "then there exists a subsequence @xmath76 converging in the topology of @xmath64 to a function @xmath77 which is a homoclinic type solution of the newtonian system @xmath78    our aim is to obtain a homoclinic type solution of by theorem [ kthm ] as a limit in @xmath64 of a sequence @xmath79 such that for each @xmath57 , @xmath74 is a @xmath7-periodic solution of the boundary value problem    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is as above and @xmath82 is a @xmath7-periodic extension of @xmath83 .    to this purpose ,",
    "we now define for @xmath57 a functional @xmath84 by    @xmath85    then @xmath86 and , moreover ,    @xmath87    hence    @xmath88    let us note for later reference that by ( * ? ?",

    "we will now obtain a critical point of @xmath51 by using the mountain pass theorem from @xcite .",
    "this theorem provides the minimax characterisation for a critical value which is important for our argument .",
    "let us recall its statement for the convenience of the reader .",

    "it is clear that @xmath110 , which is ( i ) . in order to show the palais - smale condition ( ii ) , we consider a sequence @xmath111 such that @xmath112 is bounded and @xmath113 in @xmath114 as @xmath115 .",
