    "the scalar isovector meson @xmath11(980 ) , as well as the isoscalar @xmath13(980 ) , is not easily interpreted as an ordinary qq meson belonging to the @xmath14 nonet .",
    "alternative hypotheses have been proposed : qqqq states@xcite , kk bound states@xcite , or dynamically generated resonances@xcite .",
    "+ the radiative decay @xmath4 is dominated by the exchange of the @xmath11(980 ) in the intermediate state ( @xmath15 with @xmath16 ) ; the contribution of the interfering process @xmath17 is small due to the small @xmath18 coupling .",
    "according to the possible different structures , the branching ratio of @xmath15 can vary from @xmath19 in the qq or kk case to @xmath20 in the qqqq hypothesis .",
    "the mass shape is also expected to depend on the meson structure .",
    "the process has been observed and measured by snd@xcite and cmd-2@xcite at vepp-2 m and by kloe@xcite during its first period of data taking with limited statistics .",
    "+ in this paper we present preliminary results of the analysis of the decay @xmath4 performed with the kloe detector , operated at the frascati @xmath1-factory da@xmath2ne@xcite , using a sample of 414 pb@xmath21 of the 2001 - 2002 data taking , corresponding to @xmath0 @xmath1 produced , about a factor 20 more in statistics with respect to the previous result@xcite .",
    "the decay chains corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been selected to extract the branching ratio ; the former is characterized by a higher branching ratio and large background , the latter has lower branching ratio but a smaller background contamination . + the two invariant mass spectra have then been used to evaluate the relevant @xmath11 parameters ( mass and couplings ) through a combined fit .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber@xcite , surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber sampling calorimeter@xcite , both immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.52 t with the axis parallel to the beams .",
    "two small calorimeters@xcite are wrapped around the quadrupoles of the low-@xmath22 insertion to complete the detector hermeticity .",
    "+ the drift chamber provides a measurement of charged tracks momentum with a resolution of @xmath23=0.4% , and of decay vertices with an accuracy of 3 mm .",
    "+ the calorimeter covers 98@xmath24 of the total solid angle and provides measurements of energy , time and position of photons with accuracies of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "a photon is defined as a cluster of energy deposits in the calorimeter not associated to a charged particle .",
    "+ the trigger@xcite uses information from both the calorimeter and the drift chamber .",
    "the calorimeter trigger requires two local energy deposits .",
    "events from this decay chain are characterized by five prompt photons in the final state , without any charged track in the drift chamber .",
    "a prompt photon is defined as a calorimeter cluster satisfying the condition @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the distance of the impact point on the calorimeter from the beam interaction point , @xmath29 is the arrival time , @xmath30 is the speed of light .",
    "+ the main background processes are :    1 .",
    "[ f0 ] @xmath31 , dominated by @xmath32 2 .",
    "[ wpn ] @xmath33 with @xmath34 3 .",
    "[ eg7 ] @xmath35 with @xmath36 4 .",
    "[ eg3 ] @xmath35 with @xmath6    events from process ( [ eg7 ] ) can be wrongly reconstructed as five photon ones due to cluster merging or loss , while events from process [ eg3 ] can mimic the signal due to photon splittings or to accidental clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "the background reduction proceeds through the following steps : _",
    "( i ) _ a kinematic fit on the events is performed , with the constraints of the 4-momentum conservation and @xmath37 for each prompt photon ; _ ( ii ) _ the best photon pairing to @xmath38 s and @xmath39 s is searched for in the signal and background hypotheses ; and then _ ( iii ) _ a second kinematic fit is applied by imposing also the constraints of the masses of the intermediate particles .",
    "the @xmath40 of these fits and other kinematical variables are used to cut the background events .",
    "the overall selection efficiency is 39% .",
    "the background has been evaluated on control samples dominated by the different background processes . by comparing the data with the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the experiment",
    ", the amount of each background , to be subtracted from the final sample , has been obtained(see fig.[neutri ] , left ) . +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ parameters ]    the results are plotted in fig.[plotns ] and the parameters values are reported in tab.[parameters ] . in both fits the relative normalization turns out to be in agreement , within the quoted errors , with the world average value ( 1.73@xmath41 0.03 from pdg@xcite ) .",
    "in a sample of 414 pb@xmath21 of data we have measured the branching ratio of @xmath4 selecting two different final states , corresponding to @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the two branching ratio values agree within the uncertainties .",
    "+ from the combined fit of the @xmath10 invariant mass distributions , we obtain the values of the relevant parameters of the @xmath11(980 ) .",
    "large value of @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been found , suggesting a sizeable content of strange quark in the @xmath11(980 )",
