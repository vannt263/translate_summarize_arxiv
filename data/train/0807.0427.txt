    "the variational equations associated with a solution @xmath13 of the newton s equations for @xmath1 bodies in the euclidean space @xmath14 @xmath15 are @xmath16    along a planar solution @xmath13 ( supposed to be horizontal ) , the pythagoras theorem implies these equations split into horizontal and vertical parts .",
    "namely , if @xmath17 is the decomposition of the variations in respectively horizontal and vertical components , ( ve ) is equivalent to the following pair of equations : the complicated _ horizontal variational equation _ @xmath18 and the much simpler _ vertical variational equation _",

    "now , let @xmath32 be a basis of @xmath31 ( which can be chosen orthogonal ) consisting of eigenvectors of @xmath23 with eigenvalues @xmath33 , not necessarily distinct .",
    "the general solution @xmath34 of ( vve ) is of the form @xmath35 that is @xmath36 where each @xmath37 is a _ complex _ eigenvector of @xmath23 with eigenvalue @xmath38 .",
    "first , one of the frequencies is that of the relative equilibrium , @xmath39 : it corresponds indeed to infinitesimal rotations around a horizontal axis .",
    "let us now compare @xmath39 to the other frequencies .",
    "let @xmath40 be the potential function .",
    "since a central configuration @xmath8 is a critical point of the scaled potential @xmath41 , it is natural to write @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 : @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46    let now @xmath47 , the central configuration .",
    "let us split a tangent vector @xmath48 as before , into horizontal and vertical components @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "this has a direct consequence on the hessian of the lagrangian action : let @xmath63 then , for the action during time @xmath64 , one has @xmath65 which has the same sign as @xmath66 .",
    "the proof of this formula is a direct computation : on the one hand , @xmath67 on the other hand , we have seen that , for any @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "this implies the following identity and hence the desired formula : @xmath70    it follows that , if @xmath71 , a relative equilibrium is never a local minimizer of the action ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the system may be reduced by fixing the angular momentum and quotienting by rotations around its axis ; if the relative equilibrium @xmath12 is horizontal , the angular momentum vector will be vertical . besides , by definition of a relative equilibrium , the solution @xmath12 projects to an equilibrium point @xmath72 of the reduced system .",
    "each pair of conjugate , purely imaginary eigenvalues of the linearization of the reduced vector field corresponds to a @xmath73-periodic eigenmode . in good cases ,",
    "these eigenmodes give rise to a family of solutions of the reduced system of period close to @xmath73 in the neighborhood of the equilibrium , called a _",

    ", one can use either an argument involving a higher order normal form ( such as in @xcite for the @xmath3 family ) , or a topological , existence argument ( such as the weinstein - moser theorem  @xcite ) ; for a detailed discussion on the simplest examples , see section  [ sec : localcont ] .",
    "global existence theorems also apply @xcite , but they give only general information on the nature of the families .",
    "each lyapunov family @xmath75 lifts to the original phase space as a local one - parameter ( non - reduced , lyapunov ) family of invariant two - tori foliated by quasi - periodic solutions ; on a given torus , any two solutions differ only by a rotation around the vertical axis ( figure  [ fig : lyapunov ] ) .",
    "a non - reduced lyapunov family associated with an eigenmode @xmath76 is tangent to the lift to the phase space of the _ cylindrical _ family of curves @xmath77 parametrized by a phase @xmath78 and an amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "when observed in a rotating frame which puts into resonance the horizontal and vertical frequencies , these curves become a cylindrical family of loops , whose period is an integer multiple of @xmath73 , say @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    in a continuous family of rotating frames whose rotation frequency now depends on @xmath81 ( in general the rotation of the frame will vary , due to torsion , while it is fixed along the one - parameter family of solutions in the tangent cylinder ) , the quasiperiodic lyapunov solutions @xmath82 themselves become periodic solutions whose homology class in @xmath83 is independant of @xmath81 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath84 is their monodromy , defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the frequency of @xmath81 and @xmath10 , as before , is the rotation operator , the condition is that @xmath87    the scaling invariance of newton s equations ( if @xmath82 is a solution , so is @xmath88 for any @xmath89 ) entails that each family can be freely rescaled .",
    "fixing the norm of the angular momentum is a way to choose a normalization .",
    "but when moving away from the relative equilibrium , this may artificially lead to singularities , at elements of the family having zero angular momentum .",
    "fixing instead the period ( in addition to the direction of the angular momentum ) is then a better choice of normalization , allowing to bypass zero - angular momentum elements .",
    "( on the other hand there is no hope with our techniques to bypass singularities where the period itself tends to infinity . )",
    "this allows to assume that in the above family of rotating frames the lyapunov solutions all have the same period @xmath90 .",
    "when the loops in the cylindrical family have some symmetries , the question arises whether the solutions in the the lyapunov family , when observed in the above family of rotating frames , share the same symmetry .",
    "the uniqueness statement in the lyapunov theorem implies that the answer is positive locally when the eigenmode is simple . however ,",
    "the first eigenmode is always degenerate , which requires more analysis ( see section  [ sec : localcont ] ) .",
    "the really interesting question is to continue the family globally : if the integrated torsion effect allows continuation up to the inertial frame , we shall have completed the primary purpose of our study to prove the existence of symmetric solutions in the inertial frame .",
    "if the symmetry group is rich enough , this program can be achieved using minimization of the lagrangian action .",
    "this will be illustrated in section  [ sec : global ] with choreographic and hip - hop solutions arising from the regular @xmath1-gon relative equilibrium .",
