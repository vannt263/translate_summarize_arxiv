    "because of its relevance in a wide variety of physical , biological , social and engineering contexts , synchronization of complex networks of coupled dynamical systems has recently received increasing attention . in this paper , we analyze synchronized ( possibly chaotic ) motions in complex networks of coupled _ groups _ of dynamical systems . here by a group we mean a collection of systems that have the same dynamics , with any given group consisting of systems with dynamics that is different from the dynamics of systems in the other groups .",
    "specifically , we will show that under certain circumstances , multiple group - synchronous evolutions may exist in such networks . in this type of synchronous motion ,",
    "the evolution of the states of systems within a particular group are the same , while the states of members of different groups although coherently related , are in general different ( indeed the state vectors of systems in different groups may have different dimensionality ) .",
    "the problem of collective behavior in a network connecting members of different groups is of broad interest . as a first example",
    ", we note that many efforts have been devoted to the study of teams ( groups ) of interacting robots performing synchronous coordinated tasks @xcite .",
    "other studies have regarded the coordination and control of several squadrons ( groups ) of unmanned autonomous vehicles to accomplish interdependent tasks , such as cooperative searches and attacks @xcite . in the social networks literature ,",
    "distinct collective behaviors of individuals are often related to their sex , social status and/or race .",
    "some studies have clearly pointed out how men s and women s social behaviors differ , even in situations where they are found to interact tightly , as in virtual communities or internet chats . in the brain functional assemblies of neurons have been observed to display distinct interdependent synchronous oscillations @xcite .",
    "collective dynamics of groups displaying multi - synchronous behaviors have also been uncovered in ecological systems @xcite , where competition could have favored the evolution of different synchronous behaviors of different species . for example , some corals are known to spawn synchronously during a particular season of the year @xcite . at the same time",
    ", different coral species typically spawn in different months , possibly to prevent hybridization of the species and/or as a mechanism to relieve larvae from interspecific competition @xcite .",
    "distinct roles of males and females ( as in the case of social networks ) influence the sexual activity of animals , where reproductive synchrony has been speculated to benefit survival of progeny by decreasing the likelihood of the male deserting his partner .",
    "phase synchronization between essentially different chaotic systems has been the subject of intensive study since the appearance of the paper @xcite .",
    "however , here we will be interested in complete ( full ) synchronization .",
    "moreover , multiple synchronized motions of identical oscillators have been observed to coexist in complex networks characterized by strong community structure @xcite .",
    "here we will show that under certain conditions , multiple synchronous behaviors of systems with group properties can occur .",
    ", the issue of multiple synchronized motions occurring in networks of groups has been independently addressed and the stability of an invariant subspace corresponding to multisynchronicity has been studied for unweighed networks . in our paper , the stability of the multisynchronous evolution is evaluated by introducing a master stability function , which decouples the effects of the network topology from those of the dynamics on the nodes . moreover , the more general case of weighed networks is considered . ] in this paper we focus on the case where there are two groups . in sec .",
    "ii we consider bipartite network topology and continuous time dynamics and present examples of both periodic and chaotic synchronous behavior . in sec .",
    "iii , discrete time systems are discussed . in the case of bipartite network topology studied in secs .",
    "ii and iii , a compact master stability function @xcite description for evaluating the stability of group synchronous motions is possible . when there are more than two groups or when there are two groups but a non - bipartite network structure , the stability analysis is generally more difficult . in sec .",
    "iv , we remove the constraint of bipartite network topology , and we show that the stability of the multi - synchronous evolutions is indeed possible under these more general conditions and that it can be enhanced when connections are allowed between systems belonging to the same group .",
    "in this section we focus on continuous time systems and consider a bipartite network connecting two groups . we find the conditions that allow a synchronization manifold and study its stability by means of a master stability function approach .",
    "the individual equation of an isolated ( uncoupled ) node is denoted by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , for the nodes in the first group @xmath2 and by @xmath3 @xmath4 for the nodes in the second group @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is an @xmath8-dimensional ( @xmath9-dimensional ) state vector and @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical equations of the network systems are as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an @xmath14 coupling matrix , whose entries @xmath15 represent the intensity of the direct interaction from system @xmath16 in @xmath5 to @xmath17 in @xmath2 .",

    "the interaction function @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is a mapping from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( from @xmath24 to @xmath23 ) .",
    "we now consider the possibility of the existence of multi - synchronous solutions , where by this we mean that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "substituting such an assumed solution in ( [ sys ] ) , we see that in order for a multi - synchronous state to exist the sum @xmath27 must be independent of @xmath17 and the sum @xmath28 must be independent of @xmath16 . if we denote the first sum by @xmath29 and the second sum by @xmath30 , then by the replacements @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) we see that , without loss of generality , it suffices to set @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    thus the equations of motion for the synchronized dynamics are    @xmath37      in what follows we seek to characterize the stability of the above defined synchronous state .",

    ". furthermore , we note that , if @xmath65 is an eigenvalue of @xmath68 , then , by letting @xmath76 , we see that @xmath77 is also an eigenvalue .",
    "thus the spectrum of @xmath68 is symmetric about both the @xmath75 axis as well as the @xmath78 axis .",
    "moreover , the stability of the synchronous evolutions does not depend on the particular @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , if in eqs .",
    "( [ mueta ] ) we let @xmath79 , @xmath71 , @xmath80 , we see that @xmath81 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ mueta ] ) with @xmath63 .",

    "we define a master stability function @xcite for this problem , denoted @xmath84 , where @xmath85 associates to @xmath65 , the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system ( [ block ] ) .",
    "note that the function @xmath86 can be determined without knowledge of the matrix @xmath68 .",
    "thus the synchronization stability problem is decomposed in two parts , ( i ) a part dependent only on the couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 and on the individual system dynamics @xmath87 and @xmath88 , but not on the network topology ( i.e. not on the matrix @xmath68 ) , and ( ii ) a part dependent solely on the network topology ( determination of the spectrum of @xmath68 )",
    ". another important consequence of the invariance of ( [ mueta ] ) under the transformation @xmath89 , @xmath90 is that the synchronous state stability for an eigenvalue @xmath65 is the same as for @xmath77 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus only those eigenvalues with , e.g. , @xmath92 need to be tested .",
    "the matrix @xmath68 has a pair of real eigenvalues @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "hence the eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath94 are associated with the directions parallel to the synchronization manifold ; thus they may result in positive lyapunov exponents corresponding to chaotic dynamics taking place in the synchronization manifold @xmath98 . in order to check the stability of the synchronous evolutions",
    ", one should evaluate the master stability function @xmath84 for the remaining @xmath99 eigenvalues of @xmath68 , representing the stability of the motions transverse to the synchronization manifold .",

    "from the fact that the sum of the elements in every row of @xmath68 is one , with all zero elements on the main diagonal , the gershgorin circle theorem implies that the spectrum of @xmath68 lies in the disc of unit radius in the complex plane , having its center at ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "note also that the matrix @xmath68 has at least @xmath104 zero eigenvalues , so that zero eigenvalues must always occur unless @xmath105 .",

    "moreover , the spectrum of @xmath68 can be obtained through the computation of the eigenvalues of the lower dimensional of the two matrices , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "specifically , we remove the constraint that the network is bipartite and we allow connections within the groups .",
    "we find that stable multi - synchronous evolutions are still possible and can be enhanced when intra - group connections are allowed .    as an example , we start by considering the following bipartite system , @xmath263 @xmath264 where @xmath13 and @xmath20 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ lim1 ] ) and ( [ lim2 ] ) . in the synchronization manifold eqs .",
    "( [ rossn1 ] ) and ( [ rossn2 ] ) yield the following chaotic rssler system @xcite , @xmath265 assume that the spectrum in @xmath180 includes zero as an eigenvalue .",
    "for such a case we see from ( [ rossn2 ] ) that the @xmath266-component of the master stability equation ( [ block ] ) yields @xmath267 , giving a lyapunov exponent of @xmath268 .",
    "thus the synchronized state is unstable for any network whose spectrum contains zero or small eigenvalues .",
    "we now ask how this situation is affected by the presence of connections within a group . in order to illustrate this , we consider a case",
    "in which the system ( [ rossn1]),([rossn2 ] ) is modified by adding connections within the group @xmath269 , leading to the following network equations , @xmath270 @xmath271 where @xmath272 is a laplacian matrix : @xmath273 for all @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to note that the diffusive coupling term , @xmath274 , is null in the synchronization manifold , where the dynamics is governed by the rssler equations ( [ rosss ] ) . in what follows we consider a network with @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
    "we generate @xmath13 and @xmath20 randomly as described in sec .",
    "ii.c , case ( i ) , with @xmath275 .",
    "we generate the laplacian matrices randomly taking @xmath276 for @xmath277 to be one with probability @xmath278 and @xmath167 otherwise .",
    "[ dce ] shows the effects of varying @xmath279 on the two quantities @xmath280 and @xmath281 , defined in sec .",
    "we see that the network becomes synchronized for values of @xmath282 , indicating that diffusive intra - group coupling can be effective in enhancing the network synchronization .",
    "note that , as fig .",
    "[ dce ] shows , though the diffusive terms are added only to the @xmath266-systems , synchronization applies for both the systems in @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( in particular , what is observed is that both the systems synchronize in the chaotic rssler evolution ) .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that the master stability function approach presented in sec .",
    "ii , is inadequate for assessing the stability of the synchronous evolution when both intra - group and extra - group connections are allowed in the network .    as another _ example _",
    ", we consider the system given by eqs .",
    "( [ esemcx ] ) and ( [ esemcy ] ) , introduced in sec .",
    "the network topology is represented in fig .",
    "[ 5nb ] , where here we consider the particular case of @xmath283 .",
    "thus , since @xmath284 , according to the master stability function shown in fig .",
    "[ msfchua ] , the network is not expected to synchronize .",
    "this is indeed what is shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ five ] , where the systems trajectories of the @xmath225-nodes and @xmath266-nodes are shown to follow different evolutions .",
    "now we consider whether it is possible to synchronize the network of these systems by adding diffusive couplings between systems in the same groups .",
    "namely , we add a single bidirectional diffusive link between the two @xmath225-nodes and we assume a coupling constant equal to @xmath285 .",
    "that is , we add a term @xmath286 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ esemcx ] ) for @xmath287 and a term @xmath288 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ esemcx ] ) for @xmath289 . as shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ five ] , the network is now observed to synchronize on a multi - synchronous chaotic evolution . in particular , the equations for this evolution are @xmath290 ( again , observe that the diffusive coupling term is zero in the synchronization manifold ) .",
    "motivated by the common occurrence in applications of multi - synchronous motions in ensembles of interacting systems characterized by different dynamical behaviors @xcite , we have addressed the issue of how these systems can stabilize in distinct ( possibly chaotic ) synchronous evolutions .",
    "this form of synchronization is distinct from both diffusive coupling synchronization @xcite and replacement synchronization @xcite .    by considering the underlying network of connections among the systems , we report conditions for the existence of a synchronization manifold . in the case of bipartite network topologies",
    "( i.e. , when there are two communities and network links only connect nodes in different communities ) we studied the stability of the synchronization manifold by means of a master stability function approach . in so doing",
    ", it was possible to decouple the effects of the network topology from those of the dynamics at the network nodes .",
    "we also presented an extension of our approach to discrete time systems .",
    "finally , we considered examples of the case of more general network topologies , where links are also allowed to fall within each community , and we reported numerical evidence that the presence of diffusive couplings among nodes within the same community can enhance the network synchronizability .",
    "we believe this paper represents only a first step in the study of multiple synchronization of complex networks .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate further research efforts to address this issue in the future ."
