    "now , we investigate the temporal behaviour of @xmath163 , which gives information on deformed quadrature squeezing of @xmath164 , when we consider the same data as used before .",
    "numerical results are presented in figs.5(a)-5(c ) , where we have plotted @xmath163 versus @xmath107 .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows that despite the fact that the cavity - field remains in the state quite close to the initial state , the _ f_-deformed quadrature components @xmath164 exhibits squeezing in the course of time evolution when the influence of the gravitational field is negligible .",
    "however , in view of figs .",
    "5(b ) and 5(c ) we observe that the gravitational field leads to the disappearance of quadrature squeezing completely .",
    "besides , numerical analysis shows that by increasing the nonlinearity of the model ( increasing the value of the deformation parameter _ q _ ) the quadrature squeezing occurs in smaller amount for a short time in the very beginning of the interaction when the influence of gravity is negligible .",
    "furthermore , with the increasing value of @xmath108 the quantum fluctuations in the quadrature component @xmath164 increase considerably .",
    "we proposed an _ f_-deformed formalism to study the quantum statistical properties of nonlinear jc model , including possible forms of nonlinearities of both the field and the intensity - dependent atom - field coupling , in the presence of a classical gravitational field .",

    "we found : ( 1 ) with the increasing value of the gravity - dependent parameter @xmath108 and nonlinearity ( deformation ) parameter _ q _ the rabi - like oscillations in the atomic population inversion are deteriorated .",
    "also , the presence of the gravitational field causes more energy to be stored in the cavity - field while in the absence of gravitational influence , the deformation causes more energy to be stored in the atomic subsystem , ( 2 ) both the gravitational field and the nonlinearity associated with the _ f_-deformation cause the atomic dipole squeezing to be weakened , ( 3 ) both the gravitational influence and the _ f_-deformation cause the atom to experience larger light - induced forces during its interaction with the radiation field , ( 4 ) with increasing the parameters @xmath108 and _ q _ the sub - poissonian behaviour of the cavity field is suppressed and it exhibits super - poissonian statistics and ( 5 ) the deformed quadrature squeezing of the cavity - field decreases with increase of the gravity - dependent parameter @xmath108 and the deformation parameter _",
