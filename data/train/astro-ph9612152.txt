    "uv observations from above the earth s atmosphere are vital for understanding the population i properties of metal - poor galaxies such as the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "optical - band studies of the smc have shown that this nearby dwarf irregular galaxy provides a unique laboratory for investigating stellar and interstellar evolution at `` primitive '' compositions , compared to the galaxy .",
    "many effects of composition differences appear best , or only , in the uv .",
    "line blanketing strongly affects uv colors ; similarly , the steep smc extinction curve ( a@xmath5 ) , widely thought to be due to abundances in smc dust , is `` extreme '' only in the uv .",
    "moreover , because the energy distributions of hot stars peak at short wavelengths , fuv photometry is more effective than optical - band photometry in determining the temperatures of such stars . here",
    ", we present initial results from a uv imaging study of the the smc , based on a mosaic of four far - uv images that were obtained by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) during the astro-1 and astro-2 missions in late 1990 and early 1995 .",
    "uit observed a total of four 40-arcmin diameter fields nearly completely covering the smc bar at an angular resolution of @xmath13 arcsec better than 75 times the resolution of previous uv imaging studies of the smc ( @xcite ) .",
    "a description of individual exposures used in this study is in table  [ fuvobstab ] , and a mosaic of the longest exposures for each field is shown as figure [ mosaic ] .",
    "details of uit hardware , calibration , operations , and data reduction are in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "data discussed here are from images made with the @xmath0=1620  filter , hereafter called b5. astro-1 data also include short exposures of field 1 made in a near - uv ( @xmath0=2490 ) and an additional far - uv ( @xmath0=1520 ) bandpass ( cf @xcite ) which are not discussed here . ( a discussion and analysis of uit imaging of the large magellanic cloud is given in @xcite . )    uit film images are reduced to linearized arrays and absolutely calibrated by comparison to other uv spectrophotometry as described in @xcite .",
    "the calibration for astro-2 data has been revised using flight observations of standard fields ( @xcite ) ; estimated absolute uncertainty is 15% for well - exposed pixels .",
    "an idl / uit implementation of daophot ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is used to locate stars and perform aperture and psf - fit photometry . both aperture and psf - fit photometry",
    "use a 2.9-arcsec ( 2.5-pixel ) radius , which sets the limit for resolution of blended stars and the minimum size for non - stellar sources .",
    "psf - fit photometry , using parameters chosen for images individually , is used for subsequent analysis of stellar objects .",
    "astrometric solutions are derived for uit images using hst guide stars as standards ( @xcite ) .",
    "11306 stars are measured , and positions , magnitudes , and errors for these objects are provided in the aas cd - rom series .",
    "the file includes uit star number , field number , x and y positions in uit pixels , right ascension and declination , m(162 )  derived from psf photometry , and estimated error in m(162 ) .    for the smc data ,",
    "iue observations are used to measure combined aperture corrections and improved single - field absolute calibrations .",
    "the corrections are determined by integrating well - exposed and calibrated ( bohlin _ et  al .",
    "_ 1990 ) iue spectra of isolated field stars in each uit image , and comparing the results with uit psf photometry .",
    "the number of iue spectra used for each field ranges from 12 to 31 .",
    "statistical uncertainties in mean iue / uit ratios range from .07 to .02 mag , with larger uncertainties for longer uit exposures because of the overexposure of the iue sources on those images .",
    "the iue / uit ratio thus derived agrees with the nominal uit absolute calibration within 10% , after application of a directly measured aperture correction .",
    "uit magnitudes are defined by m@xmath6  =  @xmath32.5 log(f@xmath6)@xmath321.1 , where f@xmath6 is in erg ( @xmath7  s)@xmath8 .",
    "data from multiple exposures of each field are combined by selecting data from individual exposures which maximize the signal - to - noise ratio . for stellar images and pixels which are common to two fields ,",
    "data are used from the field with the longer maximum exposure time , after signal - to - noise selection . in practice",
    "signal - to - noise selection is achieved for stellar photometry by restricting each exposure to a selected stellar magnitude range ; this avoids systematic errors at the extremes of the uit dynamic range on single exposures .",
    "for photometry of non - stellar objects , an extended - dynamic - range , calibrated composite image is produced for each field by 1 ) boxaveraging all exposures to a @xmath14.5 arcsec pixel size ( to minimize the effects of possible densitometry misalignments of up to @xmath11.12 arcsec ) , and 2 ) selecting and using pixels from the individual boxaveraged frames with exposure values which maximize signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "this composite image is subsequently used for all extended source photometry .",
    "figure [ mosaic ] shows that fuv emission from the smc originates mostly in hot stellar populations which , while not restricted to clusters , are significantly clumped .",
    "no diffuse fuv emission is readily apparent ( but see section 5 ) .",
    "the brightest features in the uit images are the clusters ngc 346 and ngc 330 , with additional fuv concentrations approximately centered in fields 1 and 2 .",
    "the bright fuv concentrations , spaced along the bar centered at @xmath10.5kpc intervals , have similar clustering and distribution properties to those evident in wide - field fuv images of the lmc ( @xcite ) .    comparison of large - scale h@xmath2   and fuv morphologies ( figure [ hapic ] a ) and b ) ) ; @xcite ) can reveal spatial and temporal sequences of star formation over timescales of @xmath120  myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "ionized hydrogen emission marks the locations of the earliest - type stars , while detectible fuv flux is emitted by stars as late as a0 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath2  is strong for clusters up to a few million years of age , while detectible fuv emission continues for about 20 myr . figures  [ hapic]a ) and b ) show that fuv concentrations cover a range of ages , including cases with coincident bright young h@xmath2   sources at the ne and sw ends of the bar , as well as evolved regions without h@xmath2 .",
    "uit field 2 , near the bar s center , provides a intriguing instance of what appears to be sequential star formation .",
    "a ring of fuv - bright stars with a radius of about 45 arcmin ( @xmath17090 pc at a distance of 60 kpc ; @xcite ) dominates the field .",
    "figures  [ hapic ] a ) and b ) show that the stellar ring is bounded by , and is apparently interacting with , ionized hydrogen in a concentric , larger ring ( radius 78 arcmin or @xmath1120140pc ) .",
    "supernova remnant 0050 - 728 ( @xcite ) , outlined by the circle in figure  [ hapic]b , lies at the northern edge of the shell .",
    "hi  observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) show loops comparable in size to the h@xmath2  ring near these locations at a range of velocities between about 90 and 130 km  s@xmath8 ; the ellipse in figure  [ hapic]b shows the location of the ring seen at @xmath1110 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "fabry - perot h@xmath2  measurements ( @xcite ) show linewidths of up to several tens of km  s@xmath8 , reinforcing evidence for ties between the distribution of hot stars and the gas dynamics . in a simple model ,",
    "the hollow - shell morphology of the hii  has been driven by winds from now - defunct hot stars and supernova remnants , which have also propagated star formation from the center outward , as evidenced by relatively gas - free stars in the center of the hii  ring .",
    "uit - based detailed analysis of sequential star formation in this region will be the subject of future work ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , comparing the distribution of uv - bright stars with that of h@xmath2  emission - line stars and small nebulae as catalogued by ( @xcite ) will reveal any systematic stellar age gradients in the 0 - 30 myr range .",
    "luminosity functions for the four fields , normalized to the number of stars in each for 14.0 @xmath9 m(162)@xmath9 14.5 , are shown in figure 3 . from turnovers of the luminosity functions we estimate the limiting fuv magnitudes of the fields to be 14.5 , 14.5 , 14.5 , and 15.0 ( @xmath100.5 ) for fields 1 - 4 respectively , consistent with relative exposure times .",
    "luminosity functions for fields 1 and 2 show features that may be confirmed from other data .",
    "the peak for 11.0 @xmath9 m(162)@xmath9 11.5 in field 1 s luminosity function ( solid line ) is clearly displayed in the field s color - magnitude diagram as a supergiant `` plume '' of stars leaving the main sequence ( @xcite ) .",
    "field 2 ( dashed line ) shows a significant overabundance of stars with 10.0 @xmath9m(162)@xmath9 11.0 ( more than 3@xmath11 overabundant compared to each of the other three fields individually ) which may be related to sequential star formation in that field .",
    "the high - luminosity ends of these m(162 )  distributions evidently show structure which reflects recent star formation .    as shown in previous uit results ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) fuv sources are generally well - correlated with h@xmath2  emission .",
    "we have compared fuv point - source locations with those of the 711 h@xmath2  emission - line stars and small nebulae within the uit fields of view ( @xcite ) , finding 520 matches at a matching radius of 7.2 arcsec ( approximately twice the estimated 1-@xmath11 the uit astrometric uncertainty for these images ) . as described above",
    ", a detailed comparison of the spatial distribution of fuv sources with and without associated h@xmath2  emission may provide insights into possible sequential star formation in the smc .",
    "we have also correlated our stellar photometry tables with the ground - based stellar photometry compiled by azzopardi & vigneau ( 1982 ; hereafter av ) by positionally matching sources .",
    "the precision to which stellar positions are quoted in av ( @xmath10.1 arcmin ) does not permit unambiguous identification of stars fainter than , typically , m(162)@xmath115 because several such stars typically occur in a part of a uit image of that size",
    ". for av supergiants , this m(162 )  limit corresponds to a spectral type of @xmath1f0 ; therefore , we do not identify or list m(162 )   values for av stars of spectral type f0 or later .",
    "( where available we have used the spectral types listed in av from @xcite and other sources which employ medium resolution slit spectra as the basis for spectral classification . ) under this spectral type restriction we find 191 sources matched of the 195 within the uit fields of view .",
    "results of the photometry of these objects are presented in table  [ avtab ] .",
    "figure 4 is a color - magnitude diagram of the 191 identified stars common to our data and av , with spectral classes differentiated by different symbols .",
    "no reddening corrections have been applied to observed data .",
    "smc - composition stellar models are produced by using model atmospheres of @xcite with log(z / z@xmath12 )  =  @xmath30.5 ( @xmath1solar/3.2 ) , on stellar evolution models of @xcite with z  =  0.004 ( @xmath1solar/5 . ) .",
    "these grid points are selected as models with composition parameters nearest to the smc s ( @xmath1solar/4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "filled circles outline a 1 myr isochrone , with masses marked ; the tracks to the upper right show the subsequent evolutionary paths of 10 , 15 , 20 , and 40 m@xmath12 stars .",
    "model stars are adjusted to distance modulus 18.9 and foreground galactic extinction e(b@xmath3v)=0.02 magnitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reddening vector shown , using the smc extinction curve of @xcite and e(b@xmath3v)=0.1 , is a typical large value for the smc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large fuv / v leverage of extinction in the smc ( a@xmath13/e(b - v)=15.75 ) is reflected in the nearly - horizontal orientation of the reddening vector .",
    "the stars catalogued by av , the visually brightest non - cluster stars in the smc , are known to be supergiants of a range of spectral types .",
    "the evolutionary tracks in figure 4 clearly demonstrate that these stars predominantly have masses between 10 and 20 m@xmath12 , and therefore , ages between 10 and 30 myr .",
    "the upper age limit is set by the faintness limit of the av data ; however , the lower limit corresponds to a real absence of supergiant stars brighter than about v=11 ( m@xmath130m@xmath12 . )",
    "while the effects of some reddening ( seen as excesses of ( m(162)@xmath3v ) color of up to 1.5 ) are apparent , most color variation seen in this figure is due to the intrinsic color variations of the stars themselves , as seen from the general segregation of spectral types by color .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the strong variation in ( fuv - v ) color with spectral type .",
    "the data points are the observed colors , as in figure 4 , plotted against spectral type from av .",
    "the solid line is a spline fit to the observed ( m(162)@xmath3v ) colors of galactic supergiants from the atlas of @xcite .",
    "the atlas colors have been reddened by the amount of the smc s galactic foreground reddening .",
    "the sensitivity of the ( m(162)@xmath3v ) color to spectral type is evident , as are the significant reddenings for some stars , caused by the large fuv leverage of the smc extinction law .",
    "the atlas colors are seen to form a blue limit for the observed colors , as expected for unreddened stars .",
    "while a true calibration of color _ versus _ spectral type for smc stars is not available , galactic values are probably appropriate for blue stars : ( m(162)@xmath3v ) colors of galactic- and smc - composition model atmospheres differ by less than 0.10 for models that have ( m(162)@xmath3v)@xmath141.0",
    ". however , at galactic ( m(162)@xmath3v)=1.5 , smc models are approximately 0.5 mag bluer , with larger differences for redder stars . therefore , much of the apparent discrepancy between the blue limit of the observed colors and the atlas colors is probably due to the fact that the locus of colors from an `` smc atlas '' would be significantly bluer for stars later than about a0 , than the galactic atlas colors shown .",
    "figure 5 provides a straightforward method of computing the reddenings along the lines of sight to the stars in av .",
    "we do so by comparing the observed colors to atlas colors for the spectral type , corrected for galactic foreground reddening , and converting the difference to e(b@xmath3v ) using the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "extinctions computed in this way are presented in table  [ avtab ] for all identified av stars .",
    "stars later in spectral type than b8 , which have uncertain intrinsic colors , are noted .",
    "figure [ redmap ] shows the resulting e(b@xmath3v ) values plotted at the locations of the stars on the smc , against the h@xmath2  image shown in figure  [ hapic]a . all values of e(b@xmath3v ) @xmath150.15 may be seen from figure  [ hapic]b to be at least along the line of sight to h@xmath2  emission .",
    "the correlation of large reddening values with location implies that these stars are probably associated with the nebulosity .    in the future uit photometry of the smc",
    "will be supplemented by additional ground - based observations currently underway by the uit team , as well as by the comprehensive photometric surveys of the magellanic clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath2  emission from hii  regions indirectly traces the ob star content of the regions via the process of nebular ionization by the hot stars and subsequent recombination of the hydrogen gas .",
    "the fuv continuum emission ( _ e.g. _ at 1620 ) from hii  regions arises from ob stars as well as from the more numerous non - ionizing stars ( mid - b through early a types . ) therefore , the comparison of h@xmath2  and fuv fluxes from hii  regions provides a sensitive measure of each hii  region s evolutionary state .",
    "evolutionary models of single - burst ionizing clusters confirm that the ratio of lyman continuum to fuv flux rapidly decreases with age , with the fuv emission remaining significant for @xmath120 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have measured fuv fluxes for 42 h@xmath2-bright hii  regions from the catalog of davies , elliott , and meaburn 1976 ( hereafter @xcite ) that were measured at h@xmath2  by kennicutt & hodge 1986 ( hereafter @xcite ) , and have compared the observed flux ratios with predictions from cluster models .",
    "we compute fuv fluxes in two ways : by summing the flux from stars in the apertures defined by kh ; and by summing all flux in pixels in the apertures the latter method including diffuse fuv emission .",
    "( our use of the kh aperture definitions causes significant aperture overlaps in a few cases . )",
    "table  [ hiitab ] presents fluxes and errors : h@xmath2  from kh ; fuv from stars ( from psf fits to stars in the aperture ) ; and fuv total fluxes from the apertures themselves .    for the fuv aperture measurements",
    "the `` sky '' flux has been set to zero , and the error term stated does not include a sky contribution .",
    "we choose this approximation because the actual sky contribution to any fuv aperture measurement or its uncertainty is very small , and any aperture inside the uit image area will measure a high background due to smc material .",
    "we set limits on true sky flux by measuring the average background in astro-2 images made in the uit b5 filter of a nearby field containing part of the globular cluster 47 tuc .",
    "these images , long exposures ( 1030 and 1800 sec ) made during orbital day , have average earth limb elevation angles and other observational conditions which are typical of those during uit smc observations , and therefore give representative background measurements ( @xcite ) . as measured in this way the sky contribution to the fuv aperture fluxes",
    "is 3.3@xmath16erg ( @xmath7  s arcsec @xmath17)@xmath8 , with an average contribution of 0.75% and a maximum of 1.60% to the individual aperture fluxes .",
    "these estimates of `` sky '' contributions are also listed in table  [ hiitab ] .",
    "figure 7 shows the data from table  [ hiitab ] .",
    "open diamonds are aperture fluxes , and crosses are stellar photometry . no corrections for galactic foreground reddening have been made to the data .",
    "the fuv flux is generally well correlated with its h@xmath2  counterpart ; furthermore , the ratio of aperture to stellar fuv flux is relatively uniform , especially for brighter hii  regions .",
    "this ratio measures the relative amounts of bright - star and `` diffuse '' light , where `` diffuse '' light here includes contributions from faint stars as well as from dust scattering .",
    "the mean value of the ratio of aperture flux to stellar flux , averaged in the log ratio for all hii   regions , is 1.79 ; weighted by flux ( the total aperture flux for all hii  regions divided by the total stellar flux for all hiiregions ) is 2.15 .",
    "two lines of argument point to a dust - scattering origin for most of the additional fuv flux , however .",
    "first , @xcite have determined the total - to - stellar flux ratio for the orion nebula , for which the number of undetected stars is small , to be 2.5 for 200 - 300   bandpasses near 1400 , 1823 , 2242 , and 2622 .",
    "second , extrapolating our measured luminosity function for the field 4 , which has the deepest exposure , to m(162)=18.0 ( corresponding to an a0 main sequence star , at which spectral type the fuv flux drops rapidly ) predicts an additional stellar flux contribution of 22% and a resulting flux - weighted total - to - stellar ratio of 1.76 significantly smaller than the observed value .",
    "scattered - light fractions near the observed smc value are found in the giant hii  regions of m33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the small smc dust abundance ( @xcite ) undoubtedly causes the scattering to be significantly less than for orion , it is nonetheless clear that dust - scattered radiation is a major contributor to the fuv aperture emission from hii  regions .",
    "figure 7 also displays the fuv / h@xmath2  ratio , known to be a good diagnostic of hii  region evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have computed f(162)/h@xmath2  ratio values for clusters with a single burst of star formation of smc composition using the idl procedure clustflux ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio rises essentially monotonically from 0.1 at 1 myr to 4.3 at 10 myr ; ratios for cluster ages of 1myr , 3myr , 6.5 myr , and 8.5 myr , corrected for foreground galactic reddening ( which increases all f(162)/h@xmath2  values by 10% ) are plotted as solid lines in figure 7 . for reference",
    ", the arrow in figure 7 shows a typical internal smc extinction of e(b@xmath3v)=0.1 ; @xcite find reddenings local to smc bar hii  regions in the range 0.08@xmath9e(b@xmath3v)@xmath90.27 by comparing 6-cm radio , h@xmath2 , h@xmath18 , and nearby stellar measurements .",
    "therefore , model and observed ratios agree well for hii - region ages of a few myr and reasonable internal smc extinction ; the observed hii  regions are evidently no older than @xmath15 myr for any internal smc reddening , and , for typical assumed smc reddening , are between 1 myr and 3 myr in age .",
    "this result is consistent with observations of hii   regions in galaxies as disparate as ngc 4449 ( @xcite ) and m81 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a clear tendency for h@xmath2-bright hii  regions to be either relatively young which is not surprising or unreddened .",
    "the absence of significantly older hii  regions is most likely a selection effect originating in kh s bias for h@xmath2-bright hiiregions .",
    "uit fuv images and derived stellar photometry for most of the bar of the smc are presented . the uv morphology of the smc s bar shows four concentrations of uv - bright stars spread from northeast to southwest at nearly equal ( @xmath130 arcmin ) spacings .",
    "one of the concentrations , near dem 55 , appears as a well - defined 8-arcmin diameter ring surrounded by a larger h@xmath2  ring and strongly suggests sequential star formation .",
    "fuv psf photometry , resulting in m(162 )  magnitudes , is obtained for 11,306 stars .",
    "we present a fuv luminosity function for the smc bar , complete to m(162 )   @xmath114.5 , and compare our photometry with the compiled ground - based data of av .",
    "detected objects are well correlated with other smc population i material ; 520 of 711 h@xmath2  emission - line stars and small nebulae within the uit fields of view are identified with fuv sources . for early type stars ,",
    "the bluest observed ( m(162)@xmath3v ) colors for each spectral type agree well with values computed from unreddened galactic spectral atlas stars for types earlier than about a0 ; for later types , observed smc stars range significantly bluer , as predicted by low - metallicity models .",
    "we attribute redder colors for some stars of all spectral types to strong fuv extinction due to even small amounts of smc dust .",
    "internal smc reddenings are determined for all catalog stars .",
    "all stars with e(b@xmath3v)@xmath40.15 are within regions of visible h@xmath2  emission .",
    "fuv photometry is obtained for the resolved stars and for the total emission from dem hii  regions in the smc bar .",
    "the flux - weighted ratio of total to stellar flux for dem hiiregions using the apertures of kh is 2.15 ; since only 22% more flux is contributed by stars fainter than m(162)=14.5 , most of the excess total flux is due to scattered fuv from dust .",
    "stellar and total emission from dem hii  regions are well correlated with h@xmath2  fluxes measured by kh .",
    "we compute ratios of fuv to h@xmath2  flux for 42 smc hii  regions and compare them with model results , finding that the observed ratios for all h@xmath2-selected hii  regions are consistent with models of smc metallicity , ages from 1 - 5 myr , and moderate ( e(b - v)=0.0 - 0.1 mag ) extinction .",

    "<S> redder colors for some stars of all spectral types are attributed to the strong fuv extinction arising from even small amounts of smc dust . </S>",
    "<S> internal smc reddenings are determined for all catalog stars . </S>",
    "<S> all stars with e(b@xmath3v)@xmath40.15 are within regions of visible h@xmath2  emission .    </S>",
    "<S> fuv photometry for 42 h@xmath2-selected hii  regions in the smc bar is obtained for stars and for total emission ( as measured in hii - region - sized apertures ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flux - weighted average ratio of total to stellar fuv flux is 2.15 ; consideration of the stellar fuv luminosity function indicates that most of the excess total flux is due to scattered fuv radiation , rather than stars fainter than m(162)=14.5 . </S>",
    "<S> both stellar and total emission are well correlated with h@xmath2  fluxes measured by kennicutt and hodge ( 1986 ; hereafter kh ) , yielding fuv / h@xmath2  flux ratios that are consistent with models of smc metallicity , ages from 1 - 5 myr , and moderate ( e(b@xmath3v)=0.00.1 mag ) internal smc extinction . </S>"
