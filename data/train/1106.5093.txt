    "the intriguing detail displayed by pne in visual wavelengths is the result of complex and dynamic interaction of very different phases of circumstellar matter , following rapid changes in stellar evolution .",
    "the ionizing uv radiation and hot , fast wind of the hot central star modifies a cool outer envelope from inside  out @xcite .",
    "in fact , many circular and elliptical pne often show a double - shell structure which consists of a rim  seen as a bright inner ring  and the surrounding shell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the latter is material already heated up by the ionizing radiation .",
    "the inner rim , on the other hand , which appears to move with a velocity of @xmath240  km  s@xmath3 , is caused by the interaction of the hot , fast wind of the central star with the cool , slowly expanding shell .",
    "the latter is the product of a recently ceased , cool , slow ( @xmath215  km  s@xmath3 ) , and dense dust - driven outflow , which accompanied the final asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stages of the star .",
    "renzini once coined the nickname `` superwind '' @xcite for this final , massive and dust - rich agb mass loss .",
    "it is a result of the very efficient interaction of the stellar radiation of a cool agb giant and the newly formed dust particles in its atmosphere .",
    "this superwind removes of the order of one solar mass in the course of about 30000 years from the stellar envelope , prior to the very end of the agb phase .",
    "this concerns stars with low- and intermediate initial mass , of about ( @xmath218  @xmath4 ) , and their mass - loss rates can reach from @xmath5  yr@xmath3 to @xmath6  yr@xmath3 .",
    "a physical record of such a cool outflow can be found outside the visible structures of a young pn .",
    "by contrast to its spectacular optical counterpart , the cool envelope is not at all so easy to observe .",
    "only the remarkable advances of observational means in the past two decades in the infrared ( iso satellite in the 90ies and spitzer in the past decade ) and millimeter - waves ( iram , large advances in detector technology , leading to a promising potential of upcoming alma , see e.g.  @xcite have put such cool envelopes now in reach of human scrutiny .    still , details of that outflow phase , and how it gives way to the observed variety of pne  like circular , elliptical , or bipolar  are not yet fully understood .",
    "it seems clear only that the transition occurs when the stars are developing from the agb to pne , i.e.  when they are in the short proto - planetary nebula phase @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this phase is rare to observe as it is short - lived ( of the order of @xmath7 years ) . but the younger a pn is , the less has the evidence of its recent past  imprinted in its cool outer envelope  been modified by the hot central star .",
    "in addition to all these questions of pn - formation , there is a further motivation to fully and quantitatively understand the final phase of mass loss on the agb : the mass lost during this time determines , by a large proportion , how much mass actually remains in the stellar remnant , the white dwarf . in other words ,",
    "work on superwinds also aims to reproduce the observed initial - final mass relation @xcite .    for a quantitative understanding of the radial density profile of a young pn s cool , outer envelope ,",
    "the mass - loss history is clearly not the only factor of importance .",
    "equally well we should know , how fast the outflow was and how much its velocity was varying .",
    "nevertheless , some cool pn envelopes appear to be reproduced quite well by means of a proper mass - loss history alone , by making the simplification that on the star s evolutionary time - scale the outflow velocity did neither change too much nor too fast .",
    "this approach was taken by @xcite , who compared observed density profiles of pne derived from spitzer images to theoretical predictions of stellar evolution calculations which included a parameter - dependent mass - loss rate .",
    "the latter is based on models for a c - rich , dust - driven , and dense wind . despite its simplicity",
    ", the assumption of constant outflow velocity still leads to reasonable agreement between models and observations .",
    "hence , here we attempt a more detailed investigation of how much the outflow velocity is actually changing in the dense , c - rich , and dusty envelope of a red giant , close to the very end of its agb stage .",
    "there are , of course , immense limitations to the observational evidence of such objects .",
    "hence , @xcite attempted such an investigation of outflow velocities based on theoretical arguments . for high mass - loss rates , @xmath8yr@xmath3",
    ", they found a very modest dependence on stellar quantities : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath11 the dust - to - gas ratio , and @xmath12 the grain size .",
    "the latter appears to have a nearly negligible influence on the outflow velocity .",
    "the same study found , observational evidence would match well such a small dependence of the outflow velocity on stellar parameters , i.e.  on the luminosity .",
    "we here want to take a new and different look at this problem by using the behaviour of the underlying hydrodynamical wind models  the same , which were used for the mass - loss parameterisation in @xcite  with respect to the outflow velocity .",
    "we are checking the assumption of constant outflow velocity in our models by checking the average velocities of the dust - driven wind models against dependence on the basic stellar quantities .",
    "for this investigation we use a set of hydrodynamical wind models that include formation and growth of dust grains which , by radiation pressure , drive massive outflows .",
    "these are characteristic of the ultimate stages of stellar evolution on the agb .",
    "the wind models have been obtained with the computer code developed by @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "they result from the selfconsistent solution of the non - linearly coupled system of equations describing the hydrodynamical and thermodynamical structure of a spherically symmetric stellar atmosphere ( with a pulsating photosphere as an inner boundary condition , providing an initial mechanical energy input ) , its chemical composition , as well as the nucleation , growth , and evaporation of dust grains , and the radiation of the central star .    the hydrodynamical wind structure ( mass density @xmath13 and outflow velocity @xmath14 ) follows from the equation of continuity and the equation of motion which includes the radiation pressure on dust grains .",
    "the law of energy conservation and radiative transfer determine the temperature structure .",
    "a carbon - rich chemistry is assumed , where oxygen is completely locked in the co molecule .",
    "the molecular composition is calculated under the assumption of chemical equilibrium .",
    "the formation , growth , and evaporation of carbon grains is calculated according to the moment method developed by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "give a more detailed summary of the physical assumptions .",
    "from a set of these models we derived a mass - loss formula for stars with solar element abundances , which have reached the tip of the agb @xcite .",
    "for that set of wind models , the velocity amplitude of the piston , used to simulate stellar pulsation , was set to a value of 5  km  s@xmath3 . that value was found to be in accordance with a sample of observed c - star lightcurves .",
    "the dependence of the mass - loss rates on the pulsation period was implicitly accounted for by the use of an observationally determined period - luminosity relation for mira stars , the most appropriate class of objects on the tip of the agb to compare with the hydrodynamical models . in this way we were able to represent the mass - loss rate by a simple relation dependent on the stellar parameters mass @xmath15 , luminosity @xmath16 , and effective temperature @xmath17 , only . in this work ,",
    "we follow a similar strategy in oder to find such a simple relation to represent the average wind velocity .",

    "the resulting quantities averaged over typically 20 periods are mass - loss rate @xmath21 , outflow velocity @xmath22 , dust - to - gas ratio @xmath23 , and radiative - to - gravitational acceleration ratio @xmath24 .",
    "the carbon - to - oxygen ratio of these models is 1.3 , which is in good agreement with both , recent stellar evolution calculations ( see @xcite , fig",
    ".  1 ) and the upper end of the observed c / o range ( see for instance * ? ? ? * ) . according to both accounts , the c / o ratio rises with the final phases of stellar evolution , from just above 1 when entering the carbon star phase , to an extreme of around 1.3 on the very tip of the agb , where we apply our dust - driven wind models .",
    "following simple physical arguments , the dynamics of optically thick winds should primarily depend on @xmath25 , since this ratio is proportional to the above - mentioned radiative - to - gravitational acceleration ratio @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that truly dust - driven outflows require an eddington - like lower limit in the form of a critical @xmath25 , above which the mean ratio of radiative to gravitational acceleration becomes @xmath26 .",

    "the mean wind velocity here is seen to grow very slowly and steadily , with exceptional interruptions caused by thermal pulses . in these cases , the most prominent change is a temporary decrease , which coincide with the steep decrease in stellar luminosity , related to the temporary extinction of the hydrogen burning shell after a helium shell flash .",
    "the energy generated in the latter takes more time to reach the surface .",
    "it generates the slow recovery and further rise of luminosity , mass - loss rate and wind velocity until the next thermal pulse occurs . in any case , the relative variation of the wind velocity is very small compared to that of the large simultaneous changes in the mass loss rate ( see fig .

    "important for hydrodynamic considerations : no large , fast increase of the wind velocity , which would lead to a compression of the outflow ahead as suggested by colliding wind scenarios , is seen in fig .",

    "when considering the superwind phase as a whole , the wind velocity increases mostly steadily from 8 to 14 km  s@xmath3 over a timespan of about 50000 years .",
    "this is a lot longer than the dynamic age of any present - day outer cool pn envelope , which would contain evidence for only the past 10000 years or so . over that latter order of timespan , only a very modest , systematic increase by about 1",

    "how do our findings compare with results from other dust - driven wind models ?",

    "[ fig : velosupps ] shows the outflow velocities of those models of @xcite , which have a free carbon abundance c - o  @xmath38 + 12 = 8.5 $ ] equivalent to a carbon - to - oxygen ratio of c / o @xmath39 .",
    "this value is the best option to compare to our choice of c / o , since only a few models in their grid with c / o @xmath40 , which is closer to our value , result in an outflow",
    ". their @xmath25 ratio does not extend to high values because in their grid models with luminosities higher than 10000  @xmath41 have only been calculated for masses larger than 1 @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the models of @xcite show a wider spread in their outflow velocities  possibly due the influence of effective temperature . as for the mechanical energy input ,",
    "we have set the piston velocity amplitude to 5  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "hence , for fig .  [ fig : velosupps ] we used the models of @xcite with the closest choices in this respect , 4 and 6  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the largest outflow velocity values seen in the figure correspond to the higher piston velocity .    even though their model set seems to suggest a steeper exponent  as would our models restricted to the lower l / m range  our velocity relation overall is consistent with their grid , especially taking into account the wider spread of outflow velocity values in the @xcite models .",
    "from the analysis of a consistent set of dust - driven wind models , we find that the velocity changes of the superwind can be parameterised by a simple dependence on @xmath25 . in absolute terms , the related velocity changes are of a small nature , of the order of a fraction of the typical wind velocity .",
    "this is consistent with the very modest dependence of the velocity on @xmath16 and @xmath15 found by @xcite , and both these findings are contrasted by the huge changes of the mass - loss rate ( by several orders of magnitude ) .",
    "looking at the final phase of the superwind , systematic velocity changes are not exceeding the inherent short - term fluctuations of the dust - driven wind . and",
    "when a tp falls into this phase , there should only be a 30% velocity dip on a timescale of 50 years , which should still be difficult to extract from the density profile in view of the intrinsic erratic fluctuations of a dust - driven wind ( over 10% on a timescale of 10 years ) .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the huge changes of the mass - loss rate in the history of a superwind , especially in the aftermath of a tp , are by far the dominant factor in shaping a present - day cool pn envelope , while changes in the velocity are hardly exceeding the natural fluctuation of a dust - driven wind .",
    "this find gives some support to a interpretation of cool pn envelopes in terms of a simple , constant outflow history , where the density profile mostly shows the progressively ( in radial direction , that is with outflow age ) diluted superwind and its mass - loss rate evolution .",
