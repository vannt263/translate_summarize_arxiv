    "more than 20 years ago , broughton @xcite pioneered the study of the topology of the fibres of complex polynomial functions of a certain type ( called b - type here ) . even if the study of the singular fibration produced by a polynomial in the affine space took a certain ampleness ever since , _",
    "families _ of such polynomial functions have been considered only sporadically .",
    "we study here families of polynomial functions by focussing on the transformation of singularities in the neighbourhood of infinity , a phenomenon which we already remarked in @xcite .",
    "this is a natural and chalenging topic inside mathematics since the atypical fibres of a polynomial turn out to be not only due to the `` visible '' singularities , but also to the `` bad '' asymptotic behaviour at the infinite frontier of the space .",
    "we deal here with the evolution and interaction of singularities in deformations at the infinite frontier of the space , in what concerns the phenomenon of conservation or non - conservation of certain numbers attached to singularities ( that we recall below ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a holomorphic family of complex polynomial functions @xmath1 , for @xmath2 in a small neighbourhood of @xmath3 .",
    "for a fixed polynomial function @xmath4 there is a well defined general fibre @xmath5 , since the set of atypical values @xmath6 is a finite set .",
    "when specialising to @xmath7 , the number of atypical values may vary ( decrease , increase or be constant ) and the topology of the general fibre may change .",
    "we consider constant degree families within certain classes of polynomials ( f - class @xmath8 b - class @xmath8 w - class , cf definition [ d : broughton ] ) which have the property that the _ vanishing cycles of @xmath4 _",
    "( i.e. the generators of the reduced homology of @xmath5 ) are concentrated in dimension @xmath9 and are localisable at finitely many points , in the affine space or in the part at infinity of the projective compactification of some fibre of @xmath4 . in the affine space @xmath10 ,",
    "such a point is a singular point of @xmath4 .",
    "the sum of all affine milnor numbers is the total milnor number @xmath11 , which has an algebraic interpretation as the dimension of the quotient algebra @xmath12/(\\frac{\\partial   f}{\\partial x_1 } , \\ldots , \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n})$ ] .",
    "singularities at infinity are equipped with so - called milnor - l numbers ( cf @xcite ) and their sum is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "then the euler characteristic of the generic fiber @xmath5 is @xmath14 .",
    "a natural problem which arises is to understand the behaviour , when @xmath15 , of the @xmath16 and @xmath17-singularities , which support the vanishing cycles of @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known and easy to see that , for singularities which tend to a @xmath16-singular point , the total number of local vanishing cycles is constant , in other words the local balance law is _",
    "conservative_. however some @xmath16-singularities may tend to infinity and change into @xmath17-singularities ; this is the phenomenon we address here .",
    "first , in full generality , for any deformation , we get the :    * _ global lower semi - continuity _ of the highest betti number : @xmath18 ( proposition [ t : spec ] ) .    next ,",
    "focussing on constant degree deformations inside the b - class , we prove several facts on the singularity exchange at infinity :    * the number of local vanishing cycles of @xmath16 and @xmath17-singularities tending to a @xmath17-singular point is _ lower semi - continuous _ , but it is not conserved in general ( theorem [ t : count ] ) . * in @xmath19-constant deformations , the local balance law at any @xmath17-singularity of @xmath7 is _ conservative _ and _ atypical values can not escape to infinity _",

    "the monodromy fibrations over any admissible loop ( in particular , the monodromy fibrations at infinity ) are isotopic in the family , whenever @xmath20 ( theorem [ t : mono ] ) .",
    "* in deformations with constant generic singularity type at infinity , @xmath17-singularities of @xmath7 are _ locally persistent _ in @xmath4 but can not split such that more than one @xmath17-singularity occurs in the same fibre ( theorem [ t : inf ] ) . * in deformations inside the f - class",
    ", a @xmath17-singularity can not be deformed into only @xmath16-singularities ( corollary [ c : lambda ] ) .",
    "the semi - continuity results ( first two of the above list ) are certainly related to the semi - continuity of the _ spectrum _ , a result proved by nmethi and sabbah @xcite for the class of `` weakly tame '' polynomials .",
    "their class excludes by definition the @xmath17-singularities , but on the other hand the spectrum ( defined with hodge theoretical ingredients ) gives more refined information than the total milnor number .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the lower semi - continuity in all these results is opposite to the _ upper semi - continuity _ in case of deformations of holomorphic function germs .",
    "we end by supplying with a zoo of examples which illustrate various aspects of the exchange phenomenon .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath21th betti number of the milnor fibre of a holomorphic function germ is upper semi - continuous , i.e. it does not decrease under specialisation . in case of a polynomial @xmath22 ,",

    "moreover , the sphere @xmath43 is transversal to all nearby fibres @xmath44 , for small enough @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that the projection @xmath45 from the pair of spaces @xmath46 to @xmath36 is a proper submersion and hence , by ehresmann s theorem , it is a trivial fibration . by the above transversality argument",
