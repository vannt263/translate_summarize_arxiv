    "one hundred years ago einstein and de haas had demonstrated experimentally that the change in the magnetic moment of a freely suspended macroscopic body generated its mechanical rotation due to conservation of the total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "( back then the concept of spin had not existed yet , magnetic moments of atoms were attributed to the atomic orbital currents carrying angular momentum . ) initially the effect has been intensively studied as a tool to measure the gyromagnetic ratio of solids .",
    "subsequent discovery of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) and the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) provided much more accurate determination of the gyromagnetic ratio , greatly diminishing the significance of the mechanical studies based upon the einstein - de haas effect . meanwhile microscopic mechanisms of the transfer of the spin angular momentum to the rotation of the mechanical system as a whole remained poorly understood , resulting in a number of revisions in recent years @xcite .",
    "the problem somewhat simplifies when the number of mechanical degrees of freedom is finite .",
    "this prompted a significant body of work on spins in mechanical resonators inspired by progress in manufacturing micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices ( mems and nems ) @xcite .",
    "einstein - de haas effect at the nanoscale has been experimentally studied in magnetic microcantilevers @xcite and theoretically explained by the motion of domain walls @xcite .",
    "switching of magnetic moments by mechanical torques has been proposed @xcite .",
    "mechanical resonators containing single magnetic molecules have been studied @xcite , experiments have progressed to the measurement of the mechanical coupling of a single molecular spin with a carbon nanotube @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize the angular - momentum - based approach developed for resonators to systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom . as an example of such problem we study generation of acoustic waves by a magnetic nanoparticle on a solid surface in the esr setup .",
    "the precession of the spin results in the time - dependent mechanical torque acting on the nanoparticle .",
    "the parameter - free nature of the torque can be traced to the conservation of the total angular momentum ( spin + mechanical ) .",
    "the resulting mechanical vibration of the particle on the surface of the solid generates acoustic waves .",
    "the effect is proportional to the ratio of the magnetic anisotropy energy and elastic energy , which has relativistic smallness due to spin - orbit origin of the magnetic anisotropy . nevertheless , the displacement of the surface in the vicinity of the particle is sufficient to be detected by the tunneling electron microscope ( tem ) .",
    "the following argument makes the acoustic tem detection of spin precession possible even in the presence of stronger effects on the tunneling current .",
    "the current , being the polar vector that changes sign due to spatial reflection , can only depend on the magnetic moment squared , because the magnetic moment is an axial vector that does not change sign under spatial reflection .",
    "consequently , the direct interaction between the magnetic moment and the tunneling current can only produce oscillations of the current at double the precession frequency .",
    "however , generation of the acoustic waves at the precession frequency will make the tunneling current through the oscillating surface to oscillate at the same frequency .",
    "oscillations of the tunneling current at the precession frequency in the vicinity of the magnetic cluster has been detected in the past @xcite .",
    "the proposed explanation was based upon oscillation of the tunneling conductance due to the spin - orbit coupling between the magnetic atom and the tip of the tem @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the model of a uniaxial magnetic particle coupled to the elastic matrix via the orientation of its easy magnetization axis is described in section [ model ] .",
    "bulk waves generated by the vibration of the nanoparticle due to the precession of its spin induced by the ac magnetic field are studied in section [ bulk ] .",
    "the boundary conditions and the surface waves are worked out in section [ surface ] .",

    "this spin is embedded into a solid ( matrix ) that can experience elastic deformations in the form of local twists in the spirit of einstein - de haas effect .",
    "this leads to the time dependence of the orientation of the anisotropy axis .",
    "rotations of the anisotropy axis are parametrized by the twist angle @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the displacement field of the crystal lattice surrounding the particle .",
    "hamiltonian is valid in the crystal frame .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian in the laboratory frame can be obtained by substituting @xmath1 by the corresponding rotated anisotropy axis : the vector of local twists can be expressed as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and any rotated vector can be calculated through rodrigues rotation formula : @xmath8 where in the last step we have considered the regime of small deformations ( @xmath9 ) and an expansion up to second order in @xmath10 .",
