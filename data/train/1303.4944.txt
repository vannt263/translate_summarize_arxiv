    "( [ rotation_z_ave ] ) , similar to the conventional weak scattering case . as for the normal strong scattering regime",
    ", the underlying physics is that when @xmath127 , the inhomogeneous broadening returns to the conventional form , which can be demonstrated by exploiting eq .",
    "( [ rotation_angle_ave ] ) and considering @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",

    "( [ rotation_y_ave ] ) , similar to the anomalous ey - like regime for the transverse srt . in the regime @xmath132 ,",
    "the srt increases with @xmath131 , because the inhomogeneous broadening returns to the conventional form , just as the normal strong scattering regime for the transverse srt .",
    "note that there is no normal weak scattering regime in this case .",
    "this is because when @xmath133 , the term @xmath134 in the rotation matrix [ eq .",

    "[ fig_impurity ] , we also plot the srt with only the impurity scattering for @xmath108  t as the azure dashed curve .",

    "it is also seen that in the case of @xmath122 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_impurity](a ) ] , the areas of both the anomalous dp- and ey - like regimes for @xmath108  t are smaller than those for @xmath116  t , while the positions of the peak remain fixed .",
    "these behaviors are consistent with the above discussions on the boundaries between different regimes .",
    "then we discuss the srts with all the relevant scatterings .",
    "the results are plotted as the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_impurity ] .",
    "one observes that the behaviors in these cases are similar to the corresponding ones with only the electron - impurity scattering , especially all the anomalous behaviors in the anomalous dp- and ey - like regimes are retained with all scatterings included .",
    "this further justifies that these anomalous behaviors can be observed in experiments .",
    "it is also shown that the srt with all scatterings is longer than that with only the impurity scattering in the anomalous dp - like regime for @xmath122 , while shorter than the latter one in the anomalous ey - like regime for @xmath135 .",
    "all these behaviors are consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ srt_z ] ) and ( [ srt_y ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is seen that the normal weak scattering regime , which previously appears at extremely low impurity for @xmath122 , disappears in the impurity density dependence with all scatterings .",
    "this is because the condition @xmath121 is always satisfied due to the inclusion of the other scatterings .",
    "the anomalous scaling of the dp spin relaxation also significantly influences the temperature dependence of the srt .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal srts are plotted as function of temperature for @xmath136 under different magnetic fields in fig .",
    "[ fig_t ] .",
    "we first focus on the transverse srt .",
    "the srt under strong magnetic field first exhibits a valley and then a peak .",
    "the underlying physics is as follows . in the degenerate limit ( i.e. , @xmath137 with @xmath138  k here ) , both the electron - electron and electron - phonon scatterings increase with increasing temperature , while the inhomogeneous broadening is insensitive to the temperature .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the srt is just determined by the momentum relaxation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_t ] , all the normal weak scattering , anomalous dp - like and ey - like regimes are in the degenerate limit .",
    "therefore , the peak and valley appear around the boundaries between these three regimes , just similar to the impurity density dependence discussed above .",
    "however , it is also seen that no valley appears in the temperature dependence around the boundary between the anomalous ey - like and normal strong scattering regimes .",
    "this is because most of the normal strong scattering regime is in the nondegenerate limit ( @xmath139 ) . in this limit",
    ", the scattering becomes insensitive to the temperature due to the competition of the decrease of the electron - electron scattering and the increase of the electron - phonon scattering , whereas the inhomogeneous broadening increases rapidly with the temperature .",
    "thus , the srt decreases with temperature in this regime .",
    "this leads to the absence of the valley .",
    "the srt under weak magnetic field also shows first a valley and then a peak .",
    "but the positions of these valley and peak are quite different from the previous ones and the underlying physics is totally different .",
    "the valley can be understood by considering that the boundary between the weak and strong scattering regimes is in the degenerate limit .",
    "the peak is due to the crossover of the degenerate and nondegenerate limits in the strong scattering regime , which is well known in the literature.@xcite then we turn to the longitudinal srt .",
    "it is seen that the behaviors under weak magnetic field are very similar to the corresponding transverse ones , but the behaviors under strong magnetic field become quite different : the srt decreases monotonically with temperature .",
    "this is just because the system in this case belongs to the anomalous ey - like regime at low temperature .     under different magnetic fields .",
    "the vertical azure dashed line indicates the temperature satisfying @xmath140 .",
    "the vertical black dotted lines separate the boundaries between different regimes for transverse srt under the strong magnetic field @xmath116  t. the vertical yellow line illustrates the boundary between the weak and strong scattering regimes in the case of weak magnetic field . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the anomalous scaling of the dp srt with the momentum relaxation time in semiconductor qws under a strong magnetic field , whose direction is parallel to the qw plane and perpendicular to the spin - orbit field .",
    "we discover that , for the transverse srt perpendicular to the magnetic field , the anomalous scaling occurs at two regimes , i.e. , the anomalous dp- and ey - like regimes . in the anomalous dp - like regime , which is in the original weak scattering limit",
    ", the dp srt is inversely proportional to the momentum relaxation time , i.e. , the strong scattering behavior . on the other hands , in the anomalous ey - like regime , which is in the original weak scattering limit ,",
    "the dp srt is proportional to the momentum relaxation time , i.e , the ey - like behavior , both in the _ opposite _ trends against the conventional dp ones . as for the longitudinal srt parallel to the magnetic field ,",
    "the dp srt is always proportional to the momentum relaxation time even in the original strong scattering limit , similar to the anomalous ey - like regime for the transverse srt .",
    "we further demonstrate that all these anomalous scaling relations come from the unique form of the effective inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "finally , we address the choice of the material . in the above calculations , we choose inas ( 110 ) qws .",
    "in fact , similar behaviors also appear in ( 110 ) qws made of the other materials with large land @xmath104 factor , e.g. , insb@xcite , and ( 100 ) qws with identical dresselhaus and rashba strengths made of inas and insb .",
    "however , the situation becomes very different for qws made of materials with small @xmath104 factor , e.g. , gaas , since the conditions @xmath141 and the well width is smaller than the cyclotron radius of the lowest landau level can not be satisfied simultaneously .",

    "<S> we report an anomalous scaling of the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation with the momentum relaxation in semiconductor quantum wells under a strong magnetic field in the voigt configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the case that the external magnetic field is perpendicular to the spin - orbit - coupling  induced effective magnetic field and its magnitude is much larger than the later one . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the longitudinal spin relaxation time is proportional to the momentum relaxation time even in the strong scattering limit , indicating that the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation shows the elliott - yafet - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the transverse spin relaxation time is proportional ( inversely proportional ) to the momentum relaxation time in the strong ( weak ) scattering limit , both in the opposite trends against the well - established conventional dyakonov - perel spin relaxation behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that all the above anomalous scaling relations come from the unique form of the effective inhomogeneous broadening . </S>"
