    "heavy quarkonia are bound states of a heavy quark and its antiquark .",
    "there are charmonia and bottomonia .",
    "the charmonium @xmath0 is the most extensively studied quarkonium state , because of its experimentally clean signature due to the large branching fraction of its leptonic decay modes .",
    "almost 40 years since its discovery , the underlying mechanisms governing heavy quarkonium production and decay are however still not understood and subject to dispute . according to the factorization theorem of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , the cross section to produce a heavy quarkonium @xmath1 factorizes according to @xmath2 + x ) \\langle{\\cal o}^{h}[n]\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the @xmath3 + x)$ ] are perturbatively calculated short distance cross sections describing the production of a heavy quark pair ( here @xmath4 ) in an intermediate fock state @xmath5 , which does not have to be color neutral .",
    "the @xmath6\\rangle$ ] are nonperturbative long distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) , which currently have to be extracted from experiment and which describe the transition of that intermediate @xmath4 state into the physical @xmath1 via soft gluon radiation .",
    "nrqcd predicts each of the ldmes to scale with a definite power of the relative heavy quark velocity @xmath7 , which serves as an additional expansion parameter besides @xmath8 : in case of @xmath9 , the leading order contribution in the @xmath7 expansion stems from @xmath10}$ ] and equals the traditional color singlet model ( csm ) prediction , while the leading relativistic corrections are made up by the @xmath11}$ ] , @xmath12}$ ] , and @xmath13}$ ] states .",
    "the upper index `` 8 '' stands for color octet ( co ) , and these contributions are usually just called _ the _ color octet contributions .",
    "the aim of our work is to test the universality of the ldmes and thereby to challenge nrqcd factorization .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to inclusive @xmath0 production cross sections have been calculated within the csm for direct photoproduction @xcite , for hadroproduction @xcite and for electron - positron annihilation @xcite .",
    "the calculation of nlo corrections to the short distance cross sections of the intermediate co states , especially to the @xmath13}$ ] states , have on the other hand proven to be very challenging .",
    "but up to now they have been calculated for all relevant collision processes as well .",
    "the @xmath14 processes for photo- and hadroproduction have already been calculated in 1998 @xcite .",
    "inclusive production in direct two - photon collisions followed in 2005 @xcite , in direct photoproduction @xcite and electron - positron scattering neglecting the small @xmath12}$ ] contribution @xcite in 2009 .",
    "the hadroproduction calculations @xcite were still missing the @xmath13}$ ] contributions .",
    "full calculations involving all co states followed in 2010 with two independent works @xcite .",
    "the missing pieces of single and double resolved two photon scattering , resolved photoproduction and the @xmath12}$ ] contributions of electron - positron scattering were finally presented in 2011 @xcite .    polarized nlo @xmath0 production cross sections",
    "have been evaluated within the csm , for direct photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite , and for the @xmath11}$ ] and @xmath12}$ ] intermediate states in hadroproduction @xcite .",
    "recently , polarized nlo cross sections including all co contributions have been calculated , namely for direct photoproduction at hera @xcite and for hadroproduction at tevatron and the lhc @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                     our results for hadroproduction @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : hadropol ] .",
    "we compare our predictions for the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 as functions of @xmath17 in the helicity and collins - soper frames with the measurements by cdf @xcite and alice @xcite .",
    "analogously to the unpolarized case we do not consider the @xmath17 range below 3  gev , where nonperturbative effects are likely to dominate . in figure",
    "[ fig : hadropolstates ] we decompose the contributions to @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 used for the predictions of the alice measurements into the contributions of the various intermediate fock states .",
    "the unpolarized cross section is recovered as @xmath21 .",
    "our predictions do not yet include feed - down contributions from higher charmonium states , whereas the cdf data are prompt , and the alice data even non - prompt , but the leading - order ( lo ) nrqcd analysis @xcite has shown the impact of @xmath22 and @xmath23 feed - downs to be rather small . in the helicity frame ,",
    "the csm predicts strongly longitudinally polarized @xmath0 at nlo , while nrqcd predicts a strong transverse polarization . in the collins - soper frame",
    "the situation is inverted .",
    "the cdf measurement at tevatron run ii @xcite , which is partially in disagreement with the measurement at run i @xcite , finds largely unpolarized @xmath0 in the helicity frame , which is in contradiction to both the csm and nrqcd predictions .",
    "the early alice data @xcite however favors nrqcd over the csm .",
    "we look very much forward to the forthcoming , more precise polarization measurements at the lhc , which have the potential to clearly confirm or dismiss the various suggested @xmath0 production mechanisms .",
    "we also note that in both photo- and hadroproduction the perturbative expansion in @xmath8 seems to converge much more rapidly after inclusion of the co states as compared to the csm , where sign and shape of the various distributions are radically changed when going from lo to nlo .",
    "we very much appreciate that very recently a second , independent , nlo nrqcd analysis involving the polarization parameter @xmath15 in @xmath0 hadroproduction has been performed @xcite . in that preprint",
    "it was shown that , neglecting data from all production mechanisms except hadroproduction , sets of co ldmes can be constructed that describe both the measured hadroproduction yield and values of @xmath15 in the helicity frame close to zero .",
    "unfortunately , as emphasized in that preprint , even after including the cdf polarization data it is still not possible to extract the three co ldmes independently in a hadroproduction - only fit , let alone to test their universality . the analysis @xcite does however allow us to cross - check parts of our results , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the helicity frame .",
    "fortunately , both works agree there , since we can reproduce their figure  2 , and when using the ldme set in the first row of their table  1 , our prediction for @xmath15 nicely lies within the `` nlo total '' band of their figure  1 .",
    "furthermore , we have verified that none of their proposed ldme sets is compatible with the observed photoproduction yield .",
    "thus both works agree on that the observed hadro- and photoproduction yields and the cdf polarization measurement @xcite can not be simultaneously described by a single set of co ldmes .",
    "we have presented a rigorous nlo analysis of the @xmath0 yield and polarization in various production mechanisms within the factorization theorem of nrqcd . we have extracted values for the three co ldmes by fitting to 194 points of inclusive @xmath0 production data from different hadroproduction , photoproduction , two - photon scattering and electron - positron annihilation measurements .",
    "we have shown that this fit is constrained and independent of the choice of possible lower cuts on the @xmath0 transverse momenta .",
    "our global fit can describe all data well , except perhaps the two - photon scattering data by delphi .",
    "besides that , the extracted ldmes do exhibit the scaling behavior predicted by the nrqcd scaling rules .    in a second step",
    "we have used the co ldmes thus extracted to make predictions for @xmath0 polarization observables in photo- and hadroproduction and compare with the currently available experimental data . as for photoproduction ,",
    "hera data is not precise enough for definite conclusions , here we have to wait for future experiments , possibly at the lhec . but as for hadroproduction , the precise results for @xmath15 from the cdf collaboration measured at tevatron run  ii in the helicity frame are in stark conflict with the nrqcd predictions .",
    "cdf measured unpolarized @xmath0 here while nrqcd predicts a strong transverse polarization . however , the cdf measurements at tevatron run  i and  ii seem to be partly in conflict with each other , and the early data from the alice collaboration at low transverse momentum at the lhc is compatible with nrqcd .",
    "future , more precise polarization measurements at the lhc , also at higher transverse momenta , will have the potential to clearly confirm or dismiss the ldme universality .",
    "we stress that our present analysis still ignores feed - down contributions from higher charmonium states .",
    "although they have been taken care of in our global fit through a subtraction of estimated contributions from the prompt experimental data , and their influence on the polarization observables is expected to be very minor , a rigorous inclusion of the feed - down contributions is still left for future work .",
