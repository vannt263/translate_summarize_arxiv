    "infinite nuclear matter is a very useful and broadly used concept , which can provide insights about the inner part of atomic nuclei , and model some regions of compact stars .",
    "it has long been an important benchmark for phenomenological and microscopic nuclear interactions and for many - body methods as well .",
    "the response of nuclear matter to different probes is the key quantity to understand the excitation of collective states or the onset of instabilities to density fluctuations . as an example of astrophysical interest we mention the study of neutrino transport properties in dense matter , which requires a detailed knowledge of the nuclear response .",
    "the landau s theory @xcite encompasses the basic properties of fermi liquids , and is a simple method largely used to calculate response functions of nuclear matter .",
    "the excitations of a strongly interacting normal fermi system are described in terms of weakly interacting quasiparticles or particle - hole ( ph ) excitations which are long - lived only near the fermi surface .",
    "the responses are obtained by solving the linearized boltzmann transport equation in the long - wavelength limit . denoting the transferred energy and momentum by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , the so - called landau limit consists in taking @xmath2 , but keeping the quotient @xmath3 fixed .",
    "these response functions depend only on the dimensionless variable @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi velocity .",
    "( natural units are used along this paper ) .",
    "the quasiparticle interaction is solely characterized by a set of landau parameters , which can be obtained from phenomenological or realistic interactions .    another method to obtain the response function is provided by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , which is the small amplitude limit of a time - dependent mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "the rpa response is a function of the two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and not only of the quotient @xmath3 . in the theory of fermi liquids ,",
    "the ph interaction is given by the second functional derivative of the total energy with respect to densities taken at the hartree - fock ( hf ) solution .",
    "exchange terms are directly included in the ph interaction by this procedure  @xcite . if the total energy is obtained from an energy density functional ( edf ) , the rpa response is self - consistent in the sense that the mean field and the ph interaction are derived from the same energy functional .",
    "detailed calculations have been mostly done based on phenomenological interactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a third method to obtain the response , which is an intermediate possibility between the previous two .",
    "it consists in describing the ph interaction in terms of landau parameters , including both central and tensor components , and calculating the rpa response function with no further approximations .",
    "actually we shall apply and extend the method previously developed to obtain the rpa response function @xcite .",
    "we shall explore the convergence of the response in terms of the number of landau parameters .",
    "our aim is to provide a general tool to obtain the response function in a simple way , which can be of interest for astrophysical applications .",
    "the three mentioned approaches have been used in different physical situations , considering a small number of landau terms , but with no tensor contributions .",
    "consider for instance the neutrino mean - free path in dense matter .",
    "it has been calculated in the framework of the landau approximation using the first two central landau parameters @xcite , and also using the rpa response function either based on skyrme interactions @xcite , or a residual interaction described with one or two landau parameters @xcite .",
    "the landau parameters have been calculated in a large variety of ways : from a g - matrix using the reid soft - core interaction , in the formalism of the correlated basis function ( cbf ) using the argonne av18 interaction , from phenomenological interactions of skyrme or gogny type , or extracted from brueckner - hartree - fock approach using the av18 interaction .",
    "new calculations of landau parameters including both central and non - central components are now available from microscopic calculations based on high - precision two- and three - body forces @xcite",
    ". they can provide useful guides for the construction of phenomenological interactions of finite range , as gogny @xcite or m3y @xcite , and zero range as skyrme  @xcite . in this case , the landau parameters are used to impose stability constraints @xcite to prevent unphysical phase transitions not predicted by _",

    ", we have investigated the rpa response function in infinite systems using the landau ph interaction .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec  [ formalism ] we present the general formalism to obtain the response function using central and tensor landau parameters . in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "due to momentum conservation , a general two - body interaction in momentum representation depends at most on three momenta . for the particle - hole case",
    "we choose them to be the initial ( final ) momentum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) of the hole and the external momentum transfer @xmath8 . in the landau - migdal approximation",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the low - energy excitations of the system are described by putting the interacting particles and holes on the fermi surface , that is @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the only variable is thus the relative angle @xmath12 between the initial and final momenta .    the _",
    "p - h _ interaction is in practice a contact interaction , which is expanded in legendre polynomials with argument @xmath12 .",
    "it includes spin and isospin degrees of freedom , and the general form for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) adopted here reads : @xmath13 ( \\bsigma_1 \\cdot \\bsigma_2 )   \\\\ & & \\quad   + \\left [ h_{\\ell } + h_{\\ell } ' \\ , ( \\btau_1 \\cdot \\btau_2 ) \\right ]   \\frac{{\\mathbf k}_{12}^{2}}{k_{f}^{2 } } \\ , s_{12 } \\bigg\\ } \\ , p_{\\ell } ( { \\mathbf { \\hat k}_1 } \\cdot { \\mathbf { \\hat k}_2 }   ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the landau parameters , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the tensor operator .",
    "we do not include other non - central components , as the center - of - mass tensor and cross - vector interactions , which have been considered by other authors ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the excitations are characterized by the spin - isospin quantum numbers @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the projections of the spin @xmath20 and isospin @xmath21 , respectively . as long as we are",
    "not interested in charge - exchange processes , the isospin projection index @xmath19 is irrelevant and will be ignored . for pure neutron matter ( pnm )",
    "there are only two quantum numbers , @xmath22 but the interaction ( [ landau - vph ] ) can be adapted in a very simple way to this case by dropping the coefficients @xmath23 and using the notation @xmath24 for the remaining ones . in the following , all the expressions for snm and pnm will be cast in a single formal expressions by using the symbol @xmath25 to indicate the relevant spin - isospin quantum numbers .",
    "for instance , the landau parameters @xmath26 will be written as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "these parameters are independent of the spin projection @xmath18 .",
    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath29 are obtained by multiplying the previous ones with the density of states per energy at the fermi surface @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor , i.e. , 4 for snm and 2 for pnm .",
    "the tensor part in ( [ landau - vph ] ) has been written according to  @xcite , which is the conventional definition .",
    "other authors @xcite have defined it without the factor @xmath32 .",
    "although the physical information is the same , the landau parameters are different in that case",
    ". this particular choice is motivated by a faster convergence @xcite , in the sense that the absolute value of parameters @xmath33 decreases as @xmath34 increases .",
    "however the conventional definition is more adapted to our method to calculate the response function so that we will keep it throughout this paper .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "we employ the method and notations presented in refs .",
    "@xcite to obtain the rpa response function .",
    "it requires the matrix elements of the ph interaction ( [ landau - vph ] ) between spin - isospin states @xmath35 .",
    "notice that they are diagonal in the indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the non - diagonal terms are related to the spin projection index @xmath18 , since the tensor term mixes its different values .",
    "we can therefore write them as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and following the notation of @xcite we have defined @xmath38 the product @xmath39 is implicitly assumed in the r.h.s . of ( [ vph - me ] ) .",
    "these matrix elements are plugged into the bethe - salpeter equation for the retarded ph propagator @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hartree - fock ( hf ) ph propagator .",
    "finally , the response function is obtained as @xmath42 to simplify the notation , momentum averages as the previous one will be indicated within brackets as @xmath43 .    to obtain the response function",
    "one has to take the momentum average of ( [ bsalpeter ] ) . the second term in the rhs is thus transformed into a double average on momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "to understand how we can treat such an expression , let us consider the dependence of angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 entering the ph interaction ( [ vph - me ] ) .",
    "this dependence comes from the legendre polynomials which are linear combinations of @xmath48 , which in turn are combinations of the products @xmath49 . due to the tensor part of the interaction , these combinations may appear multiplied by one of the following terms @xmath50 therefore , the momentum average we are interested in , @xmath51 , is coupled to other averages containing a certain number of spherical harmonics @xmath52 .",
    "the idea consists in multiplying the bethe - salpeter equation by these products of spherical harmonics and integrating over the momenta to get a new equation for each of these averages , until one ends up with a closed system of coupled linear equations for these unknown functions .",
    "the coefficients depend on the landau parameters and momentum averages of the hf propagator .",
    "let us illustrate the method in the first non - trivial case of a ph interaction characterized by the first two landau central parameters . to be more specific consider the @xmath53 channel of snm .",
    "integrating the bethe - salpeter equation we get : @xmath54 without loss of generality the vector @xmath55 can be chosen along the @xmath56-axis . since the hf ph propagator @xmath57 does not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath58 , the momentum average @xmath59 vanishes unless @xmath60 .",
    "the previous equation can thus be written as : @xmath61 where we have defined : @xmath62 the function @xmath63 we are looking for is coupled to @xmath64 . a second equation for this quantity",
    "is then obtained by multiplying the bethe - salpeter equation with @xmath65 and integrating over @xmath66 : @xmath67 equations ( [ f01 - 1 ] ) and ( [ f01 - 2 ] ) form a closed coupled system , from which one immediately obtains @xmath68 .",
    "finally , the rpa response reads : @xmath69 \\chi_{hf } ( q,\\omega ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is also valid for the other @xmath25-channels , both in snm and pnm , by simply using the appropriate landau parameters .",
    "notice that @xmath70 .",
    "the functions @xmath71 carry on the mean - field information of the response function .",
    "they play a similar role than the functions @xmath72 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference is that the latter include a @xmath73-dependence in the momentum integral .",
    "analytic expressions of the imaginary part of @xmath74 functions are given in [ app : alpha ] together with a typical example of their graphical representation .",
    "this simple case illustrates our method for solving the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it has been already employed in the case of a general ph interaction derived from a standard skyrme effective interaction including tensor components @xcite and then generalized in @xcite to the case of a second order skyrme functional  @xcite .",
    "the complete ph interaction has a complicated momentum dependence , but due to its zero - range nature it is possible to obtain practical analytical expressions for the response function in that case . in general ,",
    "the algebraic system of coupled equations can be simplified to get practical analytical expressions only in the short - frequency and long - wavelength limits , that is to calculate the static susceptibility , as was done in @xcite considering a ph interaction ( [ vph - me ] ) with an infinite number of terms . otherwise , to obtain the rpa response function with more than two landau parameters it is preferable to numerically solve the algebraic system derived from the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the consistency of our method can be tested by taking the landau limit @xmath2 and @xmath3 finite in the rpa response ( [ rpa-01 ] ) . in that limit @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "we obtain thus the familiar expression for the landau response function : @xmath78 \\chi_{hf}(\\nu ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it should .    in the landau limit",
    ", the standard skyrme interaction leads to a ph interaction described with two central and one tensor parameters in the spin channel . since an analytical expression for the rpa response function with the full skyrme interaction",
    "has been obtained @xcite , one may expect to get a relatively simpler form when using its approximated version .",
    "the systems for channels @xmath79 and @xmath80 contain four and five equations , respectively . however , contrarily to the case with the complete skyrme interaction , it is unpractical to write the analytical expressions for the response functions in terms of the landau parameters .",
    "this apparent paradox is related to the fact that the @xmath81 functions used in the former case fulfill some symmetry relations which help a lot in simplifying the final expressions .",
    "in contrast , there are no such relations for the @xmath82 functions , and the analytical expressions are long and cumbersome .",
    "nevertheless we have exploited them to derive their landau limit .    for channel @xmath79 : @xmath83 with @xmath84 which can be further simplified for small values of @xmath85 as @xmath86 analogously , for channel @xmath87 : @xmath88 with @xmath89    similarly to eq .",
    "( [ rpa-01 ] ) , these expressions are also valid for other channels , both in snm and pnm , by simply replacing the appropriate landau parameters . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these expressions have never been obtained by solving the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "analytical formulae have been given in that way only for the static susceptibility , that is the long - wavelength and short - frequency limits , for a system of electrons @xcite and , independently , for pnm @xcite as well .",
    "in this section , we calculate response functions for different sets of landau parameters extracted from finite - range interactions . in the following we prefer to show the strength function , related to the response function by : @xmath90 since all physical properties are actually embedded into it .      in principle",
    ", any finite - range interaction gives non - vanishing landau parameters for any value of @xmath34 , so that eq .",
    "( [ vph - me ] ) contains an infinite number of terms .",
    "in contrast , the only non - vanishing landau parameters calculated with standard skyrme interactions are @xmath91 for the central ones , and @xmath92 for the tensor one . for practical use , such an expansion has to be truncated to a maximum value , independent in principle for the central and the tensor parts .",
    "our choice for the truncation is guided by the recent skyrme n3lo pseudo - potential @xcite . following the method presented in @xcite",
    ", one can show that a given n@xmath34lo pseudopotential contributes to the central landau parameters up to the multipolarity @xmath34 , and to the tensor ones up to @xmath93 .",

    "however in both cases tensor effects are not very significant , since the response functions are quite similar for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "finally , the convergence is attained for @xmath126 like the previous studied cases .",
    "we have derived rpa response functions for the case of a residual interaction described in terms of its landau parameters , including tensor contributions .",
    "the response functions in the landau approximation have been immediately obtained from the rpa ones by taking the long - wavelength limit keeping @xmath85 finite . in this way",
    ", analytical expressions have been given for the landau responses up to @xmath139 ( i.e. the first two central and the first tensor parameters ) .",
    "for other cases , and in general for the rpa responses , it is useless trying to get analytical expressions and one has to solve numerically an algebraic system of linear equations .",
    "both responses coincide as expected for low values of the transferred momentum ( typically @xmath140 ) and low values of @xmath85",
    ". however neat differences are visible when @xmath1 increases .",
    "the rpa strength displays an important reshaping , in particular the absorption of the zero sound peak into the continuum .",
    "this conclusion is particularly interesting if one considers quantities such as the neutrino mean free path in dense matter , since it requires the knowledge of the response function at transferred momentum values which are not small .",
    "we have also studied the convergence as the number of landau parameters is increased .",
    "both in snm and pnm , we have seen that a satisfactory convergence is reached for @xmath126 for the considered interactions .",
    "the exception is the @xmath141 channel and d1mt interaction , which has been explained by the relative importance of tensor terms in that particular case .",
    "the response functions presented in this paper have an universal character since they can be related to any nn - potential through their landau parameters .",
    "therefore , our results could be useful for new generation of low energy effective interactions or for higher - order skyrme - type potentials ( n3lo ) .",
    "concerning the latter case , this work suggests the possibility to use landau parameters to constrain higher order terms , and in particular tensor terms .",
    "the latter are very difficult to constrain using only ground state properties , thus the use of landau response functions could be of help to define the correct interval of variation of such terms , thus avoiding instability regions  @xcite .",
    "however , the latter conditions are necessary but not sufficient to have a stable skyrme pseudo - potential : as recently shown in  @xcite , poorly - constrained coupling constants related to gradient terms can produce finite - size instabilities .",
    "these instabilities can be detected using the linear response formalism  @xcite , with no extra computational cost and directly included into the optimization procedure  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by nesq project ( anr - blanc 0407 , france ) and mineco ( spain ) , grant fis2011 - 28617-c02 - 02 .",
