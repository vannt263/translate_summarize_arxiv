    "young low - mass stars form by accretion of material through a disk , a process accompanied by outflow activity .",
    "when most of the nascent envelope has been dispersed in the later phases of star formation , a bipolar reflection nebula can be seen in the near infrared if the object is observed in the plane of the disk . under this condition",
    "the star is obscured from direct view and therefore the total near - infrared flux is dominated by the scattered light from material above and below the disk plane .",
    "many examples of such edge - on disks have been found recently .",
    "most of the disks in those objects have radii inferred from the optical or near - infrared morphology that are of the order of magnitude of our solar system ( i. e. , @xmath1 100 au ) .",
    "the prototypical hh  30  irs @xcite has a radius of @xmath1  250  au , iras 04302 + 2247 @xcite has a measured radius of @xmath1  200  au in the near infrared , while the secondary component in the hk  tauri system @xcite has @xmath1  105  au radius .",
    "the objects in the taurus star forming region @xcite range in radius from 300 to 500  au and the object found by @xcite has about 60  au radius . in the ophiuchus star forming region @xcite found @xmath1150au disk radii , while @xcite report a 300  au radius and lkh@xmath0263c @xcite has @xmath1 150  au radius .",
    "increasingly sophisticated models for these objects have been developed that treat multiple scattering , absorption and radiative transfer by dust grains .",
    "these models reproduce many of the observed features @xcite , constrain the density distribution around the central star , and give information about the inclination of the disk .",
    "in the course of a near - infrared study of the star forming region ngc  1333 in the per  ob2 complex , we found the young star asr  41 @xcite to show the morphology of an edge - on disk object with two exceptionally large scattering lobes .",
    "the edge - on disk structure of asr  41 has been independently discovered by @xcite as part of their survey of giant molecular clouds .",
    "we assume ngc  1333 to be at the same distance of 316 pc that @xcite determined for the ic  348 cluster since they are both located in the same per  ob2 molecular cloud complex .",
    "in this paper we present optical and infrared images of asr  41 in combination with advanced scattering and radiative transfer models , and we argue that the unusual size of this object ( radius @xmath1 3000 au ) is not indicative of the true extent of the disk , but rather is a projection effect of the shadow of a much smaller disk into the surrounding dusty molecular cloud material .",
    "the ngc  1333 region was imaged with the quirc camera @xcite at the uh  2.2 m telescope , on the nights of jan . 8 and 9 , 2003 ( ut ) , with the intent of surveying this region for substellar mass objects .",
    "the night was photometric , and observations in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ `` mauna kea observatories '' ( mko ) filter set @xcite were obtained .",
    "the frames containing asr  41 were part of a larger mosaic",
    ". the area surrounding asr  41 was covered by 30 individual frames in each filter , the integration times were 150 s in _",

    "a difficulty is posed by the bright sources and extended emission in this and all neighboring fields .",
    "the median filtering procedure to establish the sky frames leaves small residuals at the location of the bright sources , and contains large - scale gradients due to the presence of extended emission .",
    "the faint outer wings of the extended flux surrounding asr  41 are therefore subject to artifacts from poor sky subtraction .",
    "the h@xmath0 ( 6569/80 ) , [ sii ] ( 6730/80 ) , and _ i_-band ( 8220/1930 ) images were obtained oct .",
    "13 and 14 , 2001 , using the 4 m mayall telescope at noao with the mosaic ccd camera at a scale 0.26@xmath5/pix @xcite .",
    "_ i_-band photometry of asr  41 is based on the _ i_-band magnitudes of neighboring stars given by @xcite .",
    "images taken earlier ( oct . 29 , 1997 ) with the same equipment were used to measure the proper motion of the newly discovered herbig - haro object hh 727 .",
    "1 shows the _ k_-band image of asr  41 and its surroundings , including the herbig - haro object hh  727 , while fig .",
    "2 shows asr 41 ( and hh  727 as an insert ) in the h@xmath0 , [ sii ] , _ i _ , _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ bands .",
    "going from the shortest wavelength covered here ( h@xmath0 ) to the _ j _ band , the morphology of asr  41 changes dramatically . at h@xmath0 asr  41 appears as a faint patch of nebulosity with a faint condensation at its center . at [ sii ]",
    ", the central source appears brighter and the extended emission begins to show the `` hourglass '' shape of a bipolar nebula .",
    "the _ i _ band begins to show the bifurcation of the extended emission , albeit less pronounced than at the longer near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the dark band at an angle of about 137@xmath6 , bifurcating the reflection nebulosity associated with asr  41 , is most prominent from the _ j _ to the _ k _ band .",
    "the reflection nebula can be traced out to about 10@xmath7 from the center ( @xmath1 3000 au ) before it gets confused with artifacts from the sky subtraction process .",
    "the linear size of the scattering region therefore is about 10 to 20 times larger than in the typical edge - on disk systems listed in the introduction . either",
    ", asr  41 is a unique object surrounded by a huge extended disk or the dark band is the shadow of a much smaller ( and typical ) disk which is projected into the dusty material surrounding the object , as is strongly suggested by the wavelength dependence of its morphology . if the dark band were caused in its full extent by absorption in an edge - on dust disk in front of the scattering region , one would expect the dark bifurcating band to be more pronounced at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",
    "rather , our images suggest that the dark band is the shadow of a much smaller disk , projected into the surrounding dusty medium .",
    "the transition from single scattering at longer wavelengths , which preserves the shadow , to multiple scattering at shorter wavelengths , which fills in the shadow , occurs at wavelengths around 1@xmath8 m .    within the dark band ,",
    "a central object is clearly visible at all wavelengths from [ sii ] to the _ k _ band .",
    "this central object has a fwhm of 0.69@xmath7 in the _ k _ band , while the average fwhm of five other stars in fig .",
    "1 is 0.61@xmath90.01@xmath7 .",
    "the central object is thus marginally different from a star ; reflection nebulosity is contributing to its fwhm .",
    "its position was measured in the _ j_-band relative to 4 stars in the usno - b catalog @xcite to be 3@xmath10  28@xmath11  51@xmath12.3  + 31@xmath6  17@xmath13  40@xmath7  ( j2000 ) , with estimated errors of @xmath1 0.25@xmath7 for the absolute coordinates .",
    "astrometry of the central object in the [ sii ] image , using a larger set of usno - b catalog stars than in the case of the infrared image , showed that it has the same coordinates as the corresponding object in the _",
    "j_-band image within the relative errors of @xmath1 @xmath90.14@xmath7 .",
    "we do nt see evidence for the wavelength dependent position of the central brightness peak that is often found in cometary or bipolar nebulae associated with class i objects that are dominated by the absorption by a large and massive disk , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the central source has magnitudes in an 1.5@xmath7@xmath21.5@xmath7 box centered on the central object of _",
    "i_= 20.2 , _ j_= 17.4 , _",
    "h_= 16.1 , _",
    "the central source has a color of _ h - k _ = 0.73 and _ j - h _",
    "= 1.36 while the color of the reflection nebulosity is bluer : we have taken measurements in 1.5@xmath7@xmath21.5@xmath7 boxes at two additional positions to the north - east of the central star , i. e. , in the reflection nebula , as indicated in fig .",
    "2 . in the additional box closer to the central object",
    ", we measured _ h - k _ = 0.24 and _ j - h _",
    "= 1.05 , in the box farther to the north east we measure _ h - k _ = 0.34 and _ j - h _ = 1.15 , with estimated errors in these colors of @xmath1 @xmath90.05 mags .",
    "this is consistent with the flux from the central star and possibly the innermost parts of the reflection nebula being reddened by absorption in the small disk , and the flux in the extended reflection nebula being bluer , possibly because of preferential scattering by small dust particles .",
    "asr  41 is not associated with a strong sub - mm source .",
    "the object lies just at the southern tip of a ridge of extended 850@xmath8 m emission associated with the hh  12 complex @xcite , but it is not detectable as an individual point source in their map . from the fact that even the lowest contour ( 75 mjy / beam ) of their map is not significantly distorted at the position of asr  41 , we estimate an upper limit to its 850@xmath8 m flux of 200 mjy .",
    "this implies that the total mass of dust involved in the scattering of light from the central source , and the mass of the disk around the central star , must be relatively small .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail in section 4 .    to the south - west of asr  41 ,",
    "a faint extended object at 3@xmath10  28@xmath11  48@xmath12.1  + 31@xmath6  17@xmath13  10@xmath7  ( j2000 ) is most prominent in h@xmath0 and [ sii ] and faintly visible in _ k _ ( fig .",
    "2 , inserts ) .",
    "this is the photometric signature of a low excitation herbig - haro object without significant [ feii ] emission in the _ h _ band @xcite .",
    "the object has therefore been named hh 727 .",
    "proper motion measurements on the [ sii ] images from 1997 and 2001 show a small ( about 1 pixel ) shift of the photocenter of the hh knot towards the south west ( pa = 215 @xmath9 15 ) .",
    "the shift corresponds to @xmath1 100 km / s in the general direction away from asr  41 , roughly perpendicular to the plane of the bifurcating disk .",
    "while more precise measurements are clearly desirable , this strongly suggests that the hh object is physically associated with asr  41 .",
    "we have computed detailed models for asr  41 using a monte carlo scattered light code @xcite , @xcite ; updated in @xcite .",
    "the models contain a number of simplifying assumptions , in particular about the grain properties , and therefore can not be expected to reproduce all features of the observations .",
    "the main purpose of the modeling is to demonstrate that the object can be explained well within the current paradigm of star formation .",
    "the models discussed here are based on the assumption that asr  41 is essentially a class ii t - tauri star surrounded by a disk of roughly the size of our solar system ( r @xmath1 100 au ) , i.e. , very similar to other edge - on disk systems .",
    "the two models differ in the assumptions about the distribution of the scattering dust surrounding the central star and its protoplanetary disk .",
    "two types of models were considered : disk plus constant density cloud ( the `` disk + cloud model '' ) and disk plus infalling envelope ( the `` disk + envelope model '' ) . both reproduce the dark band as the shadow of a smaller disk .",
    "the geometry usually used to model young bipolar nebulae is an infalling envelope model , with the infall rate adjusted to model objects in different evolutionary classes @xcite . for asr  41 ,",
    "the infall rate is constraint by the upper limit for the sub - mm flux .",
    "the `` disk + envelope model '' in fig .",
    "3 uses an outer disk radius of 200 au , a disk mass of 0.06 m@xmath14 , an outer envelope radius of 7000 au , and an infall rate of 3.5@xmath210@xmath15m@xmath14/yr that is similar to the rate used in other successful models of young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "the infalling envelope has the density distribution of the free - fall models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model reproduces the basic features of the observations , but shows a steeper intensity gradient with distance from the illuminating object than was observed .",
    "it predicts a 850@xmath8 m flux of 71 mjy , consistent with the sub - mm upper limit .",
    "the other model is based on the assumption outlined in qualitative form earlier that asr  41 consists of a typical small edge - on disk object and a surrounding scattering cloud of uniform density into which the disk shadow gets projected . for this model , the density of the surrounding scattering material",
    "was adjusted so that single scattering dominates , which preserves the shadow effect and also coincidentally keeps the sub - mm flux within the observed upper limit .",
    "the `` cloud model '' uses a disk radius of 100 au and a mass of 0.005 m@xmath14 , for the best fit to the _",
    "k_-band data , the cloud itself is assumed to have a radius of 10000 au .",
    "our `` disk + cloud model '' assumes a cloud density of 2@xmath210@xmath3 g@xmath4 , that is within the range of typical densities in large molecular clouds .",
    "this model produces a 850@xmath8 m flux of 40mjy , well below the sub - mm flux limit .",
    "increasing both the cloud density and disk mass by an order of magnitude leads to slightly better fits to the near - infrared fluxes , but predicts a 850@xmath8 m flux of 234mjy , i. e. , above the flux limit .",
    "3 shows the _ k_-band image of asr  41 ( top , rotated to have the polar axis vertical for comparison with the models ) , and the two model flux distributions .",
    "some noise was added to the model images to make them more visually comparable to the real image .",
    "the `` disk + envelope '' model is successful at matching the photometry , but morphologically , the flux is falling off too rapidly with distance from the central source due to the density distribution in the envelope .",
    "the `` disk + cloud model '' matches the near - infrared morphology better , including the large extent of the reflection nebulosity .",
    "both model fits to the observed photometry indicate inclinations of about 80@xmath6 , even though the match to the observed morphology , in particular the difference in flux from the two lobes could probably be improved by assuming somewhat lower inclinations .",
    "these problem our models have with precisely matching the near - infrared photometry and morphology of the object point to shortcomings in the dust model used here .",
    "our code is currently limited to one dust model throughout , and given the extent of the object an interstellar grain model was chosen .",
    "this is a good approximation for the particles expected in a thin molecular cloud , but may not be a good model for the grains in a much denser , proto - planetary dust disk in the close vicinity of a young star , e.g. @xcite . due to the obvious simplifications in our model , they are not suitable to derive the luminosity or detailed information about the evolutionary state of the star at the center of asr  41 .",
    "we have presented images of the young stellar object asr  41 in ngc  1333 at wavelengths ranging from h@xmath0 to the _ k_-band .",
    "the bipolar nebula seen at the longer of these wavelengths is much larger than typical edge - on disk systems but can be understood as the shadow of a smaller disk being projected into the dusty material of the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "detailed model calculations of the scattering and radiative transfer in this object have been presented .",
    "these models show that the morphological features and the near - infrared fluxes can be modeled by a small , low - mass disk and surrounding scattering medium without violating the upper limit on the sub - mm flux .",
    "asr 41 is , most likely , a class ii t tauri star with a disk of roughly the size of our solar system , and overall similar to other edge - on - disk objects .",
