    "astrophysical jets are launched by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) processes in the close vicinity of the central object  an accretion disk surrounding a protostar or a compact object @xcite .",
    "however , the principal mechanism which actually launches the outflow - the transition from accretion to ejection - for a certain disk at a certain time is still not completely understood .    during the recent decade ,",
    "numerical simulations of mhd jet formation became more and more feasible and substantially helped to improve our understanding of how jets emerge .",
    "in general , these simulations may be distinguished in those taking into account the time evolution of the disk structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) and others considering the disk surface as a fixed - in - time boundary condition for the disk wind or jet ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first approach allows to study the launching process directly in particular the mechanism lifting matter from the disk plane into the outflow .",
    "however , this approach is computationaly very expensive and yet limited by spatial and time resolution . in order to study the jet formation process - the acceleration and collimation of a disk / stellar wind - it is essential to follow the dynamical evolution of the system for many ( several thousands ) of rotational periods and on a sufficiently large grid with appropriate resolution .",
    "for such a goal , the second approach is better suited .",
    "since it is computationally less expensive it also allows to perform series of simulations for parameter studies .",
    "it is clear that the prescription of mass flow rate and magnetic flux profile constrains the result of the simulation more than a consistent simulation of the jet - disk evolution which could in fact provide the mass loss rate from the disk into the jet . on the other hand",
    ", the current status of mhd disk modeling has its own limitations .",
    "in particular the magnetic field structure in the disk is a rather open question unless radiative mhd , global simulations of dynamo - active disk models provide fully self - consistent results .",
    "the aim of this paper was to investigate the interaction and interrelation between a stellar wind and a disk wind and represents a unique approach in that field .",
    "for this first step it is of advantage to govern the simulation by well understood boundary conditions .",
    "further , for our goal it is essential to study the long term evolution of the outflow at considerable distances from the star . if we would include the disk evolution in the simulation it would be hard to reach the appropriate time scales .",
    "in fact all disk simulations so far stop at earlier time scales .",
    "future work should include the disk evolution for the jet launching .",
    "one may further distinguish between the different initial setup for these simulations - some of them consider a pure stellar dipole ( see e.g. @xcite ) , others a pure disk field ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the case of a superposed stellar and disk magnetic field is yet rarely treated in simulations , however , the first such model configuration was discussed already by @xcite .",
    "one example is @xcite who superposed a central dipole with an aligned vertical disk field .    in this paper",
    ", we study the long - term evolution of a two - component mhd outflow consisting of a stellar wind launched from a stellar magnetosphere and a surrounding disk wind .",
    "it essential to follow the time evolution for very long term in order to be able to take into account the evolution also of the outer regions of the disk magnetosphere as much as possible .",
    "the magnetic field of protostellar jets ( and probably also those of micro - quasars ) most probably consists of two components - a central stellar , probably dipolar field plus a field component provided by the surrounding accretion disk ( either generated by a disk dynamo or advected from interstellar space or both ) .      in the following we qualitatively expose the main aspects of the interaction between a central stellar field and the disk magnetic field and how that may affect the overall jet formation .    _",
    "enhanced magnetic flux_. the stellar field adds magnetic flux to the system . assuming a polar field strength @xmath0 and a stellar radius @xmath1 , the dipolar field scales with @xmath2 this has to be compared to the disk poloidal magnetic field provided either by a disk dynamo or by advection of ambient interstellar field .",
    "the latter can be estimated by equipartition arguments , and is limited to @xmath3 the stellar magnetic field will not remain closed , but will inflate due to shear between the disk surface and the star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the additional poynting flux that threads the disk may support the mhd jet launching and may provide an additional energy reservoir for the conversion of magnetic energy to jet kinetic energy , thus , implying a greater asymptotic jet speed ( michel scaling , see @xcite ) .",
    "_ additional magnetic pressure_. the central magnetic field provides additional magnetic pressure implicating possible de - collimation of the overall outflow .",
    "the stellar magnetic field may drive a strong stellar wind which will remove stellar angular momentum . this stellar outflow will interact with the surrounding disk wind .",
    "the observed protostellar jets may consist of two components  a stellar wind and the a wind , both with a strength depending on intrinsic ( yet unknown ) parameters .",
    "_ angular momentum exchange_. in the scenario of magnetic  disk locking \" ,",
    "the stellar field threading the disk will re - arrange the global angular momentum budget .",
    "angular momentum of the star is transfered by the dipolar field and deposited at the inner disk .",
    "thus , matter orbiting in this region will be accelerated to slightly super - keplerian rotation .",
    "this has two interesting implications .",
    "( i ) due to the super - keplerian speed this disk material could be more easily expelled into the corona by magneto - centrifugal launching @xcite and forms a disk wind .",
    "( ii ) excess angular momentum in that disk area will slow down accretion unless removed by some further process . the disk outflow launched from this very inner part of the disk",
    "can be an efficient way to do this .",
    "this scenario is similar to the x - wind models @xcite .",
    "_ non - axisymmetric effects_. in addition to the simple picture of an axisymmetric configuration , an inclined stellar magnetic dipole will add non - axisymmetric effects .",
    "a moderate non - axisymmetric perturbation may result in warping of the inner disk , and , thus , a precession of the outflow launched from this area . for extreme cases of inclination , jet formation may be completely prevented .",
    "a rotating inclined dipole further implies a time - variation of the magnetic field strength at the inner disk radius .",
    "this may lead to a time - variation in the accretion rate and , also , the mass outflow flow rate .",
    "numerical simulations of the warping process @xcite indicate that the warp could evolve into a steady state precessing rigidly .",

    "-axis ) we distinguish jet inflow boundary conditions ( shaded areas of ghost cells outside active grid ) from the star ( @xmath4 ) and the disk region from @xmath5 ) .",
    "the mass flux from star or disk is prescribed by the profile for the inflow density and inflow velocity ( dashed arrows ) .",
    "the latter is typically of about @xmath6 of the local keplerian speed .",
    "the stellar boundary is in rigid rotation , the disk boundary in keplerian rotation .",
    "the disk inner radius is at the co - rotation radius . in the gap area between disk and star ( @xmath7 ) a minimum `` floor '' mass flux",
    "is defined in order to keep the simulation going .",
    "thin contours indicate initial poloidal field lines for one of the simulation runs .",
    "[ fig_model ] , width=264 ]      the simulation of outflows from star - disk magnetospheres is a difficult numerical task due to strong gradients in magnetic field strength , density / pressure , and also the velocity field .",
    "still , the first simulations of a stellar dipole surrounded by a disk have been presented in seminal papers as early as 1984 by @xcite . probably due to the success of the disk wind models @xcite",
    "the formation of outflows from stellar magnetospheres became somewhat unattended before the topic was re - discovered in the early 90ies with several model suggestions @xcite .",
    "numerical , stationary - state mhd solutions of the star - disk jet formation problem were presented subsequently @xcite .",
    "time - dependent simulations of dipolar magnetospheres started again later @xcite .",
    "however , the time scale of these simulations including the disk evolution was short - a few inner disk rotations .",
    "goodson et al .",
    "@xcite in a series of papers presented simulations runs of dipolar star - disk magnetospheres for up to 150 ( inner ) disk rotations , in particular considering the reconnection / flaring behavior of the magnetic field close to the inner disk radius . as another result ,",
    "a highly collimated , narrow jet emerged along the rotation axis for which the authors also presented forbidden emission line maps .",
    "simulations by @xcite followed a similar setup , however , based on an increased grid scale of @xmath8 and run for times scales of 150 days ( stellar case ) .",
    "magnetic flares emerging from the inner disk location lead to episodic mass ejections .",
    "these flares were both triggered and triggering a variation of the disk mass accretion rate and a corresponding change in the inner disk radius .",
    "reconnection is strongly interrelated to magnetic diffusivity ( resp .",
    "electric resistivity ) , however , such model assumptions were not particularly specified in these papers .",
    "@xcite investigated the setup of an ambient vertical field aligned with a central dipolar field .",
    "their scenario is somewhat different to what we consider : the surrounding magnetic field is rather weak and vertical and , thus , not an active outflow - generating disk field as in our case .",
    "the authors identified three classes of field geometries - as in our setup depending on the direction of the ambient field .",
    "as a main result , in all three cases the collimation of the central outflow was observed , similar to earlier suggestions by @xcite .    in comparison , @xcite did not treat the disk structure in their simulations , allowing them to follow the evolution of the the stellar magnetosphere for more than 2000 rotation periods of the inner disk .",
    "these simulations showed for the first time that the axial jet feature observed in some of the simulations before @xcite is in fact an intermittent feature and disappears on the long term .",
    "the initial axial jet appears essentially during relaxation process of the hydrostatic initial condition towards a hydrodynamic steady state .",
    "@xcite were first to introduce a physical stellar wind boundary condition in addition to the disk wind .",
    "the emerging two component outflow from star and disk remained un - collimated .",
    "this was understood as caused by the fact that no net electric current was driven along the outflow ( since the initial dipolar field distribution ) .",
    "since the stellar dipolar field becomes very weak along the disk , a classical magneto - centrifugal wind launching becomes inefficient .",
    "this is another reason for the lack of collimation observed in these simulations .",
    "simulations of the disk - star interaction @xcite focus on the dipolar accretion process and potential angular momentum exchange between star and disk .",
    "no evidence was found for persistent outflows and only episodic ejections from the inner disk area occurred .",
    "time - dependent simulations of winds from an initially spherically symmetric stellar magnetic field were performed by @xcite , evolving exactly into the classical stationary weber - davis solution .",
    "@xcite derive the angular momentum loss of pure stellar winds by numerical simulations .",
    "the setup is similar to the stationary - state models calculated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outflow angular momentum loss derived from these simulations is comparable to what can be derived from the stationary models .    while the simulations from dipolar magnetospheres failed to show collimated outflows , mhd simulations of disk winds did actually proof the self - collimating characteristics of mhd winds .",
    "after seminal papers by @xcite and @xcite this approach was further developed taking into account the time - dependent change of disk field inclination @xcite , turbulent magnetic diffusivity in the jet @xcite , a variation in the disk wind magnetic field and density profile @xcite , or non - axisymmetric effects @xcite , and also the disk dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "recent simulations by @xcite investigated the `` topological stability '' of two - component ( star - disk ) self - similar solutions derived from stationary mhd . in difference",
    "to our approach their simulations do not start from an initial hydro-_static _ state , but from an initial dynamical steady state solution of the mhd equations , with analytical extrapolations in the case of radially self - similar solutions ( which are singular on the axis ) .",
    "@xcite presented two - component outflow simulations including the treatment of the disk evolution . however , although the wind dynamics indeed consists of two components , the magnetic field distribution basically resembled a monotonous field profile ( i.e. no stellar dipole , no stellar outflow involved ) .",
    "we perform axisymmetric mhd simulations of jet formation for a set of different magnetic field geometries and mass fluxes .",
    "the general model setup follows @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , however , with important modifications .",
    "the original zeus-3d ideal mhd code @xcite extended for physical magnetic resistivity ( see description and tests in @xcite ) is used . for the purpose of this paper the magnetic diffusivity",
    "was set to such a low level that it does not affect the overall collimation of the outflow .",
    "however , resistivity / diffusivity is essential for our simulations , as it allows for magnetospheric reconnection phenomena .",
    "the set of mhd equations considered is the following , @xmath9 @xmath10 + \\nabla ( p+p_a ) +   \\rho\\nabla\\phi - \\frac{\\vec{j } \\times \\vec{b}}{c } = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath11 @xmath12 + p ( \\nabla \\cdot\\vec{v } ) - { \\frac{4\\pi}{c^2}}\\eta \\vec{j}^2= 0,\\ ] ] with the usual notation for the variables ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is space and time dependent and is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we apply a polytropic equation of state for the gas with the polytropic index @xmath14 .",
    "as @xcite we have added turbulent alfvnic pressure in order to allow to keep the corona `` cool '' .",
    "in fact , we do not solve the energy equation [ eq_energ ] and apply the internal energy of the gas reduced to @xmath15 .",
    "two major reasons to do this are both computational speed and numerical stability . some of our long - term simulations did last already more than two months of cpu time and it would be impossible to reach the desired evolutionary steps if the energy equation would have been solved . following @xcite this approach also allows to combine gas pressure forces and gravity under the same derivative in the code .",
    "thus , instead of subtracting gradients , we apply the gradient of the difference , which results in perfect stability of the initial state .",
    "note , however , that recent work by clarke and collaborators seems to indicate that relaxation of the polytropy assumption may affect the dynamical evolution in certain domains of the jet , in particular regions with shocks or contact discontinuities @xcite .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity can be considered as turbulent and , thus , be related to the alfvnic turbulent pressure @xmath16 if we assume that it is primarily due to the turbulent alfvnic waves which are responsible for the turbulent alfvnic pressure applied in the simulations . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have derived a toy parameterization relating both effects by parameterizing the _ turbulent magnetic diffusivity _ similar to the shakura - sunyaev parameterization of turbulent viscosity , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the characteristic dynamical length scale and velocity of the system , respectively . with",
    "that we obtain @xmath21 and with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , it follows that @xmath24 , or , normalized , @xmath25 . for the chosen polytropic index",
    "this implies a magnetic diffusivity @xmath26 if @xmath19 is constant ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we again stress the point that in the present paper the magnetic diffusivity is on a such a low level ( much below the critical level found in @xcite ) that it does not affect the dynamics , but allows for reconnection .    for the numerical grid ,",
    "we use the `` scaled grid '' option by zeus with the element size decreasing inwards by a factor of 0.99 .",
    "the size of the cylindrical grid is @xmath27 elements resulting in a physical grid size for all simulations is @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath29au for @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the disk gap ( @xmath31 ) is resolved with 11 grid elements .",
    "time is measured in rotation periods ( keplerian orbits ) at the inner disk radius .    in summary , compared to our previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the main new feature included in the present approach is that the initial magnetic field distribution consists of two components - a stellar dipolar field and a disk field . in difference to recent studies by @xcite we included both outflow components and magnetic field components in the simulation box , in particular treating the star - gap - disk boundary .      along the @xmath32-boundary",
    "we distinguish between the star extending from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , the gap region extending from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , and the disk region from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , see fig.[fig_model ] .",
    "a keplerian disk is taken as a ( fixed in time and space ) boundary condition for the mass inflow from the disk surface into the corona and the magnetic flux .",
    "the stellar surface is approximated by a rigidly rotating `` disk '' in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the stellar rotation is chosen such that the inner disk radius is located at the co - rotation radius .",
    "the initial magnetic field is purely poloidal .",
    "magnetic field lines are anchored in the disk and the rotating star and are in co - rotation with their respective foot point . the poloidal magnetic field profile along the @xmath32-boundary remains fixed in time and is , hence , determined by the choice of the initial magnetic field distribution .",
    "the disk region governs the mass inflow from the disk surface into corona ( denoted as `` disk wind '' ) .",
    "in addition to that we prescribe a stellar wind with different mass load .",
    "the hydrodynamic boundary conditions are `` inflow '' along the @xmath32-axis for the disk and stellar region and either `` inflow '' ( very light mass flow ) or `` reflecting '' for the gap region , `` reflecting '' along the symmetry axis and `` outflow '' along the outer boundaries .",
    "matter is `` injected '' from the disk and the star into the corona parallel to the poloidal magnetic field lines with very low velocity @xmath39 and with a density @xmath40 .",
    "the proportionality constants are typically @xmath41 and @xmath42 for both , stellar and disk wind ( but usually different for both components ) . along the gap",
    "we impose a floor value for the density @xmath43 and a similarly low velocity . for the injection velocity ,",
    "the assumption is that the initial disk wind speed is in the range of the sound speed in the disk , @xmath44 .",
    "these mass loss rates from star and disk , respectively , are our other main parameters besides the respective magnetic flux ( see tab .",

    "is introduced in order to avoid kinks in the field distribution .",
    "several combinations of both field components were investigated , parameterized by combinations of @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig_ini ] shows three examples for the initial field configuration for different strength and alignment of the field components .",
    "similar field geometries have been discussed already by @xcite .",
    "@xcite did consider similar configurations , however , superimposing a stellar dipole with a weak vertical disk field .    in order to allow for a clear comparison between all our runs , the respective magnetic field component _ profiles _ and wind density component _",

    "we now discuss a number of mhd jet formation simulations covering a wide parameter range ( see tab .",
    "[ tab_all ] ) concerning both the magnitude of the disk and stellar wind mass load and magnetic flux , respectively .",
    "the results presented here are preliminary in the sense that not all simulation runs could be performed over time scales sufficiently long enough for the mhd flow _ as a whole _ to reach the grid boundaries or to establish a stationary state .",
    "this is due to the comparatively large physical grid size in combination with steep gradients in the disk wind parameters which in general allow only for a weak outflow from large disk radii .",
    "in particular the steep decline of the stellar field in combination with a reasonable disk mass loss rate is numerically problematic ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , for a true comparison between different runs it is essential to also take into account the dynamical state of the outflow .    in order to check for resolution issues",
    ", we have also run a set of simulations with twice the resolution , without seeing significant differences ( runs a4b , a5 , a6 ) .",
    "thus , since we are interested in many parameter runs evolving for a long time , we mainly concentrate on the lower resolution simulations .",
    "we describe first the general evolution of jet formation in our simulations ( see also @xcite ) and later discuss specific features .",
    "figure  [ fig_evol1 ] shows how the field structure evolves in time for the simulation run a4a . in this case the stellar dipolar field and the disk field are aligned .",
    "thus , the x - point is initially along the rotational axis .",
    "we have stopped this simulation after 3600 keplerian rotations at the inner disk radius .",
    "this corresponds to 6 rotations at the outer disk radius and makes it clear that the outer parts of the disk wind have not yet completely evolved into a quasi - stationary state .",
    "this is a generic problem of all disk - jet simulations published so far as soon as large disk radii are considered .    the evolution during the very first time steps from the initial shows that above the emerging outflow the initial steady state corona is still present .",
    "the x - point which was initially located at @xmath57 along the rotational axis , moves upwards to @xmath58 ( for @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 ) and is later swept out of the computational domain for @xmath62 ( see top of fig .",
    "[ fig_evol1 ] and discussion end of sect.4.2 ) .    since the initial condition is still kept in steady state , artificial dynamical re - configuration is prevented .",
    "this demonstrates that the numerical resolution is sufficient for our problem also in the out parts of the grid .",
    "the next dominant feature is observed still at early stages of about ten rotations .",
    "the initial dipolar field breaks up due to the magnetic pressure of the toroidal magnetic field induced by differential rotation between star and disk .",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient drives this outflow .",
    "furthermore , an intermediate axial jet is launched due to the re - arrangement of the initially hydrostatic corona to a new dynamical equilibrium state .",
    "in fact , as the magnetic field along the axis is squeezed by lateral dynamical pressure , the material is accelerated along the rotational axis .",
    "after the dipole is broken up , there is few direct magnetic connection between star and disk anymore and the differential rotation induced toroidal field decreases .",
    "the outflows from star and disk continue to grow gaining higher kinetic energy and momentum .",
    "mhd self - induction of toroidal magnetic field leads to collimation and magnetic acceleration .",
    "compared to pure disk winds @xcite the outflow is clearly less collimated as being de - collimated by the central stellar wind .    at intermediate time",
    "scales quasi - stationary states may emerge .",
    "this is demonstrated for example in simulation a4a in fig .",
    "[ fig_quasi ] by showing the time evolution of the density at point @xmath63 .",
    "two plateaus are clearly seen at different density levels indicating two quasi - stationary states of the flow evolution .",
    "one is from @xmath64 till @xmath65 , the other from @xmath66 when the outflow is slowly re - adjusting from the flaring events ( see below ) .",
    "note , however , that at this time the outer disk has rotated only about a fifth of an orbit .",
    "thus , the field and flow above the outer disk will further evolve in time and again disturb the enclosed structure in quasi - steady state .",
    "we observe that over even longer time scale such quasi - stationary states may be reached ( and be disturbed ) again and probably again and again .",
    "we believe that this feature is due to the still ongoing evolution of the outer disk wind .",
    "the final states of some representative simulation runs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_final1 ] and [ fig_final2 ] .",
    "we will discuss them in sect.[sect_final ] below .",
    "as seen already from the initial field configuration , the simulations of the anti - aligned field configuration ( as e.g. a4a ) reveal a change of sign in the magnetic flux distribution from star and disk ( negative magnetic flux is indicated by dashed contours in fig .",
    "[ fig_reversal ] ) .",
    "the location of flux reversal is accompanied with a concentration of contour lines in our figures which may be confused with the existence of a shock .",
    "this is however an artifact of the choice of contour levels for the magnetic flux .",
    "in fact , it makes sense to follow the same field lines emerging from the stellar surface also back into the disk surface . since the strong gradient of the stellar dipolar field , magnetic flux levels aroung @xmath67 are concentrated . figure [ fig_reversal ] shows that the radial profiles of density , velocity and poloidal field accross the flux reversal .",
    "note that the location of magnetic field reversal ( the neutral field line ) is at a smaller radius @xmath68 compared to the magnetic flux reversal at about @xmath69 . within the magnetic field reversal magnetic flux is accumulated . beyond the field reversal",
    "the magnetic flux decreases and then becomes negative .",
    "our version of zeus code has physical magnetic diffusivity implemented ( see @xcite for explanation and tests ) .",
    "this allows to consider reconnection processes .",
    "we observe reconnection flares along some of the outflows ( see fig .  [ fig_evol2 ] ) .",
    "these flares are similar to coronal mass ejection .",
    "they rapidly evolve and propagate along the neutral field line .",
    "once formed , reconnection islands ( or rather `` tori '' in our axisymmetric setup ) propagate across the jet magnetosphere within a few rotation times and leave the computational domain .",
    "the flares typically expand and reconnect within 70 time units equivalent to 70 orbital periods of the inner disk ( and 70 stellar rotations ) .",
    "we may also naively measure the flare propagation speed by the proper motion of the field lines observed in the simulation .",
    "this gives an average `` flare propagation speed '' of about unity , as they travel 80 spatial units in 70 time units - the keplerian speed at their foot - point .",
    "the flares propagate along the neutral field line , and leave the physical grid at a radius corresponding to about 7 - 10 au from the axis .",

    "the flare eruptions are launched close to the inner disk area , but _ not _ at the inner disk radius .",
    "@xcite also observed flares or reconnection events in their simulations of a dipolar magnetosphere connected top a surrounding accretion disk .",
    "since the evolution of the disk structure was treated in their simulation , they were able to observe time - dependent accretion along the equatorial plane .",
    "the frequent ejection events of au - sized knots along the rotational axis were correlated with a time - variation of the accretion rate .",
    "this is different in our case , where the reconnection / flares seem to be triggered by the evolution of the outer disk wind .",
    "as mentioned , during the run - time of our simulations ( up to 3600 inner disk rotations ) the corona ( or disk wind respectively ) above the outer disk has not yet reached a steady dynamical state .",
    "thus , in our case , as the outer disk outflow evolves , the cross - jet pressure equilibrium is changed and forces the inner magnetic field configuration to adjust accordingly . since goodson et",
    "al did not specify the distribution and magnitude of the magnetic diffusivity in their simulations , it is difficult to compare the results in detail .",
    "another difference is the duration of the simulation .",
    "while our physical grid size is only marginally larger , the time scale of our simulations is substantially longer ( 3600 inner disk rotations corresponding to about 36,000 days compared to 130 days ) .",
    "this is particularly important when considering the dynamical evolution above the outer part of the disk and the long - term behavior .",

    "we see a 10%-variation in the mass flux followed by a sudden decrease of mass flux by a factor of two during flare two .",
    "figures [ fig_mflux_mv ] and [ fig_mflux_v ] show the profiles of jet momentum and poloidal velocity across the upper r - boundary .",
    "we see that during flaring these profile indicate a re - arrangement of momentum and velocity profile across the jet . before the flare ,",
    "the radial jet momentum profile is broad ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mflux_mv ] upper left for @xmath76 ) .",
    "in fact , the profile ( fig .  [ fig_mflux_mv ] , @xmath76 ) remains very similar for several 100 rotations before until the flare event starts .",
    "after the flare has passed the grid , the jet momentum profile is concentrated within a cylindrical sheet of radius @xmath77 and thickness @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mflux_mv ] lower right at @xmath79 ) .",
    "similar to the situation before the flare , the jet momentum profile for time steps after the flare ( @xmath80 ) look almost identical ( see bottom sub - figures for @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "this behavior is somewhat mirrored in the poloidal velocity profile .",
    "what is interesting for shock formation in the asymptotic jet , is a temporal change in jet velocity at certain jet radii ( see below ) .",
    "the maximum velocities in the outflow reach about two times the keplerian speed at the inner disk radius and vary by a factor of two . along the neutral field line",
    "the outflow velocity is fast - magnetosonic ( see figs .  [ fig_small1 ] and [ fig_final2 ] where the fast surface is indicated ) .    as an estimate for the reconnection time scale",
    "we may apply the sweet - parker approach with @xmath83 with the dynamical ( alfvn ) time scale @xmath84 and the diffusive time scale @xmath85 . with our model of turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath86",

    "for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 at the reconnection area with @xmath90 ( for simulation a16 ) that @xmath91 .",
    "this is similar to the duration of the reconnection flare we observe between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "note an interesting feature in both of the general model setups ( aligned and anti - aligned field geometry ) concerning the reconnection geometry .",
    "figures [ fig_small1 ] and [ fig_small2 ] show the inner structure of the star - disk magnetosphere .",
    "these simulations ( a04a , a16 ) were launched from differently aligned field geometries ( aligned / anti - aligned disk - stellar field ) . in the anti - aligned case the initial x - point is along the axis . however , as the magnetic field evolves , the dipole expands and sweeps off the initial field along the axis .",
    "a new x - point evolves by disruption of some of the closed dipolar field loops .",
    "the new x - point is located above the disk close to the inner disk radius ( see above ) .",
    "this situation is not very different from the the aligned case for which the initial x - point , located along the equatorial plane , moves up to a certain ( small ) height above the disk . in summary ,",
    "our simulations show that no magnetic x - point remains along the equatorial plane as e.g. assumed in the shu et al .",
    "x - wind model .",
    "instead we find from both initial configurations an x - point above the disk ( sometimes also called y - point , @xcite ) , located at time - averaged distances ( @xmath94 ) or ( @xmath95 ) , respectively .",
    "the generation of knots in protostellar jets is a long - standing puzzle . in particular , it is unclear whether the shocks / knots are triggered by the internal engine or due to interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "a strong argument for the first possibility is the existence of some perfectly symmetric jets as hh212 @xcite , however , the majority of jet sources looks asymmetric .",
    "internal shocks along the jet flow may be caused e.g. by a time - dependent velocity variation of the material injected into the jet ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "even if we have observational support for the idea of the jet knots being triggered by the central engine , we do not know _ how _ the central engine does that . the time scale derived from typical knot separations @xmath96 and velocities @xmath97 correspond to @xmath98 which is clearly different from the keplerian time scale close to the inner disk edge from where the jets are launched .    considering the ejection of large - scale flares and the follow - up re - arrangement of outflow density and velocity distribution in our simulations , one is tempted to hypothesize that the origin of knots is triggered by such flaring events .    in our simulations ( a4a , a16 )",
    "the time scale of flare generation is about 500 - 1000 rotational periods of the inner disk , corresponding to about 30 - 60 years ( assuming an inner disk rotation period of , say two times the co - rotation period of a typical ttauri star of about 10 days ) .",
    "the variation in the hydrodynamic parameters lasts for about 30 - 40 inner disk rotation times ( respectively about @xmath99 days for a 10day stellar rotation period ) .",
    "the further evolution and generation of further flaring events is of course not known as it is beyond our computation time .",
    "the essential point , however , is that we detect a _ long _ time scale , substantially longer than the typical dynamical time scales at the jet formation area .",
    "that time scale is surprisingly similar to the time scale defined by the observed knot separation and velocity . of course , it is to early to draw firm conclusions from such a tentative agreement .",
    "the reconnection time - scale is governed by the magnetic diffusivity for which we have applied our self - consistent model of turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xcite .",
    "it is left to further simulations of the asymptotic collimated jet beam to check whether the detected variation in outflow speed and mass flux ( figs .",
    "[ fig_mflux_i],[fig_mflux_mv],[fig_mflux_v ] ) is sufficient in order to generate strong internal shocks comparable to the observed knots .      in this section",
    "we compare the overall collimation behavior of the different simulation runs . in previous studies @xcite we quantified the degree of outflow collimation @xmath100 by comparing the mass flow rates in axial and lateral direction , @xmath101 in tab .",
    "[ tab_all ] we provide mass flow rate within four differently sized volumes , @xmath102 , considering different sub - grids of the whole computational domain , i.e.cylinders of radius and height @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "we calculate the mass fluxes _ ratio _",
    "normalized to the size of the area threaded by the mass flows in r- and z - direction , @xmath105 .",
    "the ratio of grid extension @xmath106 as displayed in our figures converts into a ratio of cylinder surface areas of @xmath107 . as a general measure of collimation degree",
    ", we give an average value @xmath108 which may consider also the dynamical state of the simulation run .    compared to our previous work on pure disk wind collimation , where the relative mass flux of the collimating disk wind is a sufficient quantitative measure of collimation",
    "the situation in the present setup is not exactly the same .",
    "naturally , the stellar wind mass flux emerges close to the outflow axis and will tend to stay close to it .",
    "thus , a high stellar mass flux will naturally cause a more collimated mass flow .    in order to compare the collimation degree within the large volume ,",
    "it is essential to check the evolutionary state of the flow . in all of our simulation runs the initial corona has completely swept out of the grid . in this case , all of the mass flux we measure has been launched by the disk wind .",
    "exceptions are simulations a10 , a13 , and a12 , where a relict of the initial bow shock are still visible in the outer layers .",
    "the mass loss rates in these examples have to taken with care , at least the values from the larger volumes .",
    "run a16 is evolving very slowly in the outer part and it was not possible within reasonable cpu time to evolve the disk wind to larger distances from the disk surface .",
    "the degree of collimation derived from the simulations is in general different for the the different volumes , @xmath109 .",
    "in most cases , the degree of mass flux collimation increases along the flow which is exactly the signature of mhd self - collimation .",
    "the outflow starts as un - collimated disk / stellar wind , and reaches the outer grid boundaries as collimated beam .",
    "a good example is simulation a7 , where the collimation of mass flow changes from ration @xmath110 for the inner region to @xmath111 in the outer parts .",
    "the same arguments hold for simulations a8 , a15 , a14 .",
    "a similar behavior is seen e.g. in simulations a10 , a13 , a14 , however , the collimation in mass flux around the largest volume is low . in these cases",
    "the outermost flow structure has not yet evolved into a steady state and either parts of the initial bow shock or the initial corona are still in the computational domain .",
    "a counter example is simulation a12 , which stays un - collimated in mass flux , although the magnetic field distribution looks collimated .",
    "simulation a12 is exceptional for its high mass flux launched from the disk surface .",
    "thus , the disk wind starts super - alfvnic and super - seed the magnetosonic speed quickly .",
    "the standard blandford - payne magneto - centrifugal acceleration is not very efficient in this case , which also results in only little induction of toroidal magnetic field and , thus , lorentz force , see fig,[fig_lorentz ] .",
    "the radial component of the perpendicular lorentz force component is negative , i.e. directed inwards , however , too weak to balance the strong inner centrifugal force , resulting in a weak collimation of the outer part .",
    "table [ tab_all ] shows also the time evolution of the collimation degree .",
    "example a15 demonstrates how the collimation degree progresses in time . from earlier times",
    "( t=550 ) to later times ( @xmath112 ) collimation increases as the outflow evolves into a new dynamical state over the whole numerical grid .",
    "the same hold for example a14 and others .",
    "examples a7 , a8 , a9 are calculated for a high stellar wind mass load , thus the time - evolution of the outer disk wind does not play a big role concerning collimation .",
    "this outflows reach a high degree of collimation early in time .     at time @xmath113 .",
    "[ fig_lorentz ] , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   at time @xmath113 .",
    "[ fig_lorentz ] , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      the mass loss rates from star and disk are prescribed as boundary condition .",
    "a higher mass load in the stellar wind component would naturally result in a higher degree of collimation in the mass flux as this mass is just launched closer to the outflow axis .",
    "simulations a2 and a3 are good examples .",
    "the stellar wind mass loss is 2 - 3 times the disk wind mass flux .",
    "the resulting mass flux ratio is similar , thus this outflow is rather well collimated hydrodynamically .",
    "however , in spite the quite good collimation in mass flux , the magnetic field structure is not collimated with almost ( spherical ) radially expanding poloidal field lines ( see fig .  [ fig_final1 ] ) . the field structure ( and thus the poloidal velocity field )",
    "has a conical shape and is thus un - collimated .",
    "similar as for simulation a12 ( see above ) the disk wind is too weak in order to collimate the stellar wind to a high degree .",
    "simulations a12 and a13 have the same star - disk magnetic field profile , however with a different mass load by a factor of ten .",
    "run a12 reaches the same dynamical evolutionary state as a13 , but earlier at @xmath114 instead of @xmath115 .",
    "the less magnetized outflow a13 is stronger collimated .",
    "run a14 has the same mass load as a13 , but the double magnetic flux resulting in similar collimation degree .",
    "simulations a10 and a13 differ only by the stellar wind mass load ( factor two ) , however this mass load is low and does not result in a variation of the overall degree of collimation . note that for both simulations , the outer area of the outflow has not yet evolved in a steady state and a relict from the initial bow shock are still visible .      from the technical point , the simulation of the case where magnetic dipole and disk magnetic field are anti - aligned ( a3 , a4 , a10 , a13 , a12 , a14 ) are computationally less expensive and were therefore able to evolve to considerably longer time .    for the aligned cases ( a9 , a8 , a7",
    ", a16 , a15 , a2 ) only the less magnetized evolve into a quasi stationary state in the outer ( disk ) outflow in reasonable time .",
    "we mention in particular run a15 with a reasonably strong disk magnetic flux which enables a collimating disk wind ( compare to a16 and a7 ) .",
    "simulations a9 , a8 and a7 demonstrate that a low mass flux disk wind mass flux can not evolve into a collimated disk wind even if the magnetic flux is relatively high if it is dominated by a strong central stellar jet .    the most promising model setup in order to explain strong stellar jets from a star - disk magnetosphere are those with relatively strong disk wind and disk magnetic flux .",
    "the stellar wind dominated simulations may give a high degree of collimation , however they collimate to too small radii . stellar magnetic flux dominated simulations tend to stay un - collimated .",

    "we have performed axisymmetric mhd simulations of jet formation from accretion disks surrounding a magnetised star .",

    "our physical grid size is @xmath139 inner disk radii corresponding to about @xmath140au for @xmath30 .",
    "disk and stellar surface are taken as a time - independent boundary condition for the outflow mass loss rates and the magnetic flux profile .",
    "the major goal of this paper was to investigate the long - term interrelation between a stellar dipolar field and a disk field and how that affects the outflow collimation .",
    "certain combinations of stellar versus disk magnetic flux and field directions were considered namely the cases of an aligned resp .",

    "the stellar magnetic field has an important impact on the jet formation process by providing additional magnetic flux , additional central ( magnetic ) pressure component , excess angular momentum in the jet launching region . it might disturb the outflow axisymmetry , and/or trigger a time - variation in outflow rate in the case of an inclined central stellar magnetosphere .",

    "we conclude that strong protostellar jets must be generated by collimating disk winds with reasonable mass load .",

    "<S> axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations have been applied to investigate the interrelation of a central stellar magnetosphere and stellar wind with a surrounding magnetized disk outflow and how the overall formation of a large scale jet is affected . </S>",
    "<S> the initial magnetic field distribution applied is a superposition of two components - a stellar dipole and a surrounding disk magnetic field , in both either parallel or anti - parallel alignment . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the mass outflow is launched as stellar wind plus a disk wind . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations evolve from an initial state in hydrostatic equilibrium and an initially force - free magnetic field configuration . due to initial differential rotation and induction of a strong toroidal magnetic field the stellar dipolar field inflates and </S>",
    "<S> is disrupted on large scale . </S>",
    "<S> stellar and disk wind may evolve in a pair of collimated outflows . the existence of a reasonably strong disk wind component is essential for collimation . a disk jet </S>",
    "<S> as known from previous numerical studies will become de - collimated by the stellar wind . in some simulations </S>",
    "<S> we observe the generation of strong flares triggering a sudden change in the outflow mass loss rate by a factor of two and also a re - distribution in the radial profile of momentum flux and jet velocity across the jet . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the hypothesis that these flares may trigger internal shocks in the asymptotic jets which are observed as knots . </S>"
