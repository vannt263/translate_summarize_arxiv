    "the non - equilibrium properties of coupled quantum dots ( qds ) in the coulomb blockade regime , of both serial and parallel configurations,@xcite have been studied extensively .",
    "much of the interest in qd systems is of fundamental character because of the close analogy of qds as artificial atoms and coupled qds as artificial molecules.@xcite especially , coupled qds provide the opportunity to tune the interdot tunnelling and capacitive coupling which change the conductance spectra and current - voltage ( @xmath0 ) characteristics of the system .",
    "qds displaying ratchet effects have been explored both experimentally and theoretically,@xcite and it was recently shown that coulomb interactions between qds can give rise to ratchet effects.@xcite other phenomena have been studied extensively in coupled qd systems through the past decade , such as , negative differential conductance,@xcite",
    "asymmetries,@xcite spin - pumping and spin - filtering,@xcite quantum phase transitions,@xcite and the kondo effect in serial@xcite and parallel@xcite coupled qds .",
    "recent transport measurements on double quantum dots ( dqds ) have revealed technical possibilities to utilise the pauli exclusion principle for the construction of efficient current rectifying devices.@xcite the charge transport through a series of zero dimensional sites , with broken inversion symmetry with respect to the applied bias voltage , is suppressed by a combination of the pauli principle and the coulomb blockade in one direction while permitting it to flow in the opposite direction , thus , realising a controllable spin - coulomb rectifier . in systems with absence of inversion symmetry ,",
    "bias - dependent rectification effects can , on the one hand , be provided by bias voltage dependent transition rates between the states in the system , as was suggested for single molecules with appropriately configured molecular orbitals,@xcite and for multiple dots suffering from the coulomb blockade effect.@xcite on the other hand , as we show in this paper , while the transition rates normally are bias voltage dependent , this is _ not _ a necessary condition to achieve the spin - coulomb , or _",
    "pauli spin _ , blockade and rectifying properties of the system .",
    "instead , for small interdot tunnelling rates we find it necessary that the two - electron triplet states are aligned ( or almost aligned ) with , at least , the lowest two - electron singlet state , and that these states are almost aligned with the lowest one - particle states .",
    "this condition for the dqd , described in more detail later in the paper , agrees very well with experimental set - up .",
    "while the system displays @xmath0 asymmetries and ratchet effects when this condition is not satisfied , the origin of those effects is more related to normal coulomb blockade rather than the more intriguing pauli spin blockade observed in refs . .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a theoretical study of the transport properties of a dqd in the regime considered in ref .",
    ", in order to obtain a qualitative picture of the origin of the pauli spin blockade . in excellent agreement with the experimental report",
    "we find that the blockade regime indeed arises because the two - electron triplet state in the dqd is occupied with nearly a unit probability .",
    "the probability for the two - electron triplet state to be occupied strongly depends on the ratio between the interdot tunnelling rate @xmath1 and the energy spacing @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the single electron level in qd@xmath4 .",
    "the dqd system itself provides a range of different regimes , of which the one considered here is given in the following set up , e.g. @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the interdot coulomb repulsion whereas @xmath8 is the on - site charging energy of qd@xmath4 , and @xmath9 is the equilibrium chemical potential . for definiteness ,",
    "assume that the system is biased such that the electron flow is directed according to _ left lead _",
    "@xmath10 qd@xmath11 qd@xmath12 _ right lead_. then , for a small ratio @xmath13 , the probability for an electron in any of the two - particle singlet states to exit the dqd to the right lead is sufficiently large to prevent a build - up of the population in these states .",
    "the probability for electrons in the left lead to enter the dqd in any of the singlet states is of the same order which , however , does not affect the inability of charge accumulation in these states . for the two - electron triplet states the situation is somewhat different , since electrons occupying the triplet has a very low probability to exit the dqd to the right lead , whereas there is an almost unit probability for an electron in the left lead to enter the dqd in the two - electron triplet .",
    "hence , there will be an accumulation of electron density in the triplet state , which leads to an almost complete occupation of this state .",
    "the accumulation of electron density in the two - electron triplet along with the negligible probability for occupying the two - electron singlets ( as well as for the one- and three electrons states ) provide a blockade of the current , e.g. pauli spin blockade , for a finite range of bias voltages over the dqd .",
    "it is important to notice that the occupation probabilities are equally distributed among the spin @xmath14 configurations .",
    "therefore , although one can conclude that the pauli spin blockade is caused by a fully occupied spin 1 state , it would in general be impossible to read out the definite spin state of the dqd in this regime .    in the opposite case , e.g. small @xmath15 ,",
    "the configuration of the dqd is mirrored in the sense that the triplet state acquires a small probability for occupation since the leakage into this state from the left lead is small whereas the corresponding leakage to the right lead is large .",
    "thus , there can not be an accumulation of charge in the triplet state .",
    "in contrast , since the probabilities for electrons to enter and exit the dqd via the singlet states are non - negligible ( as in the former case ) , the occupation in the dqd oscillates between one and two electrons , that is , the current is not blockaded by a charge accumulation in the dqd .",
    "the considered dqd system is complicated in the sense that we have included on - site charging energy of the qds , the interdot coulomb and hopping energies , as well as the interdot exchange interaction energy .",
    "it is therefore motivated to describe the physics of the dqd in terms of its eigenstate , given in the atomic limit ( disconnected to the leads ) .",
    "the current through the dqd is thus described by considering single electron transitions between the various states .",
    "the treatment of the dqd dynamics is performed by means of a many - body density matrix approach for the population numbers of the eigenstates , up to the first order with respect to the couplings to the leads .",
    "this density matrix approach is similar to the one employed by cota @xcite also , coish and loss used this technique in their study of electron spin dynamics interacting with an environment of nuclear spins via hyperfine interactions.@xcite in the model we only take one level in each qd , which is sufficient to describe the main features of the transport properties for low bias voltages , however , in the non - linear transport regime . for larger voltages than considered here ,",
    "it is expected that more levels in the qds participate in the conduction which would provide additional understanding to the experimental observations.@xcite our model differs from that used by cota , @xcite in that we also include spin - spin interactions between electrons in the two qds .",
    "furthermore , while they considered time - dependent transport induced by spin - polarised pumping in the dqd , we concentrate here on the stationary pauli spin blockade phenomenon which to our knowledge has not been considered before .",

    "<S> in a two - level system , constituted by two serially coupled single level quantum dots , coupled to external leads we find that the current is suppressed in one direction of biasing caused by a fully occupied two - electron triplet state in the interacting region . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the current suppression is governed by the ratio between the interdot tunnelling rate and the level off - set . in the opposite bias direction , </S>",
    "<S> the occupation of the two - electron triplet is lifted which allows a larger current to flow through the system , where the conductance is provided by transitions between one - electron states and two - electron singlet states . </S>",
    "<S> is is also shown that a finite ferromagnetic interdot exchange interaction provides an extended range of the current suppression , while an anti - ferromagnetic exchange leads to a decreased range of the blockade regime . </S>"
