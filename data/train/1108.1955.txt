    "because entanglement is crucial to most quantum information applications , convenient and accurate methods for its measurement and calculation are essential .",
    "alas , though considerable work by a large number of very intelligent people has made considerable progress ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , we have as yet no general method , of universal applicability , much less one which is easy to implement .    for 2-qubit systems",
    "the problem is fairly well understood , from more than one point of view .",
    "for example , the `` entanglement of formation''@xcite approach is based on the idea of construction : how much entanglement is necessary in order to reconstruct this particular state ?",
    "this gives us a general measure as an analytic formula , so that , if one knows the density matrix , one can easily calculate the entanglement .",
    "however , generalizations to larger systems are difficult@xcite .",
    "various geometric methods@xcite use an extremely appealing idea of `` closeness '' to the subspace of separable states : one constructs some distance measure in the state space , then , performs a minimization calculation to find the distance of closest approach .",
    "product states , of course , have zero distance to that space , and have therefore zero entanglement . many entanglement witnesses@xcite are based on this same idea .",
    "the drawback is , of course , the optimization calculation , which rapidly becomes impractically difficult for large systems . in addition , these approaches assume that one knows the density matrix .",
    "one might not . and reconstruction of the density matrix , like optimization , is not easy to generalize to large systems .",
    "most witnesses also require that the state of the system be `` close '' , in some sense , to a given , known state@xcite .",
    "clearly it would be of great interest to have a general , experimental method for estimation of the entanglement , for which one would not have to know or to reconstruct the density matrix , which would not require lengthy optimization procedures , and which could be applied to any state .",
    "we present here such a method .",
    "we demonstrate that our method works for large classes of states of 2-qubit , 3-qubit , 4-qubit , and 5-qubit systems , and show that extension to larger systems is clearly achievable .",
    "we begin with the schrdinger equation : @xmath0   \\label{schr}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the density matrix and @xmath2 is the hamiltonian , whose formal solution@xcite is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the liouville operator .",
    "we consider an n - qubit system whose hamiltonian is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pauli operators corresponding to each of the qubits , @xmath7 are the tunneling amplitudes , @xmath8 are the biases , and @xmath9 , the qubit - qubit couplings .",
    "we choose the usual `` charge basis '' , in which each qubit s state is given as 0 or 1 ; for a system of n qubits there are @xmath10 states , each labelled by a bit string each of whose numbers corresponds to the state of each qubit , in order .",
    "the amplitude for each qubit to tunnel to its opposing state ( i.e. , switch between the 0 and 1 states ) is its @xmath11 value ; each qubit has an external bias represented by its @xmath12 value ; and each qubit is coupled to each of the other qubits , with a strength represented by the appropriate @xmath13 value .",
    "note that , for example , the operator @xmath14 , where there are ( n-1 ) outer products , acts nontrivially only on qubit a.    the parameters @xmath15 direct the time evolution of the system in the sense that , if one or more of them is changed , the way a given state will evolve in time will also change , because of eqs .  1 - 3 .",
    "this is the basis for using our quantum system as a neural network .",
    "there is a mathematical isomorphism between eq .",
    "[ schrsoln ] and the equation for information propagation in a neural network : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the output vector of the network , @xmath18 the input vector , and @xmath19 the network operator , which depends on the neuron connectivity weight matrix @xmath20 . here",
    "the role of the input vector is the initial density matrix @xmath21 , the role of the output is the density matrix at the final time , @xmath22 , and the role of the `` weights '' of the network is played by the parameters of the hamiltonian , @xmath23 , all of which can be adjusted experimentally as functions of time@xcite . by adjusting the parameters using a neural network type learning algorithm we can train the system to evolve in time to a set of particular final states at the final time @xmath24 , in response to a corresponding ( one - to - one ) set of given inputs . because the time evolution is quantum mechanical ( and , we assume , coherent ) , a quantum mechanical function , like an entanglement witness of the initial state , can be mapped to an observable of the system s final state , a measurement made at the final time @xmath24 .",
    "complete details , including a derivation of the quantum dynamic learning paradigm using backpropagation@xcite in time@xcite , are given in @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the quantum system is calculated by integrating the schrdinger equation numerically in matlab simulink , using ode4 ( runge - kutta ) , with a fixed integration step size of 0.05 ns@xcite .",
    "the system was initialized ( prepared in ) each input state , in turn , then allowed to evolve for 300 ns .",
    "a measurement is then made at the final time .",
    "all of the parameters @xmath15 were taken to be functions of time ; this was done in the simulation by allowing them to change to a different constant value every 75 ns ( i.e. , four `` time chunks '' . ) discretization error for the numerical integration was checked by redoing the calculations with a timestep of a tenth the size ; results were not affected . for the backpropagation learning , the output error needs to be back - propagated through time@xcite , so the integration has to be carried out from @xmath24 to 0 . to implement this in matlab simulink ,",
    "a change of variable is made by letting @xmath25 , and running this simulation forward in @xmath26 in simulink .",
    "more generally , a nonlinear system can be written as @xmath27 where x is the state , f is a nonlinear function , g is an output measure , u is the system external control input , and y is the system output .",
    "x , u , and y are all functions of time .",
    "notice from eq .",
    "[ schr ] that our quantum system is of the form @xmath28 , and the ( complex ) operator @xmath29 contains the parameters p = @xmath15 . in general p can be a set of a priori system parameters , ( e.g. the mass , spring constant , and damping coefficient , in a mass spring damper system . )",
    "u is a control input that is not fixed ahead of time , and can be calculated on the fly and varied as the system is running , i.e. , for every different run of the system , u can be recalculated based , usually , on the current state of the system x(t ) as it is going from x(0 ) to x(@xmath24 ) .",
    "so u can be different for different initial conditions ( x(0 ) values ) .",
    "while the set of parameters p can be functions of time as the system runs , they are fixed at the same values every time the system is run going from any x(0 ) to x(@xmath24 ) , once determined via the network learning process .    a control problem , then",
    ", would be to calculate u on the fly over a period of time in order to make the system states x or output y behave in a certain way .",
    "an optimal control problem would be to choose u to minimize some cost function j(x , u ) or j(y , u ) .",
    "given initial conditions x(0 ) and u , the system can be integrated from t=0 to t=@xmath24 so that @xmath30 our quantum system , on the other hand , has no external input , so it is written @xmath31 where now q defines the quantum system and m is some output measurement made on the system at the final time . the quantum computation problem is to find values for the specific fixed parameters p such that the quantum system approximates a given function @xmath32at a finite number of points , m , in the domain , that is , @xmath33 when @xmath34 .",
    "this is not a control problem , but a problem of finding a finite dimensional ( with dimension equal to the number of parameters in p ) subspace approximation of the function h. interpreted as a quantum neural network , the weights p are found through a learning algorithm , where @xmath35 $ ] i=1,m are the training pairs in a training set , and the cost function to be minimized is @xmath36^{2 } $ ] for each and every i=1,m , where from eqs .",
    "8 - 9 , @xmath37)=m(q(@xmath38(0),p ) ) is the output for the system started in initial condition @xmath38(0)=r@xmath39 .",
    "almost all the information contained within a system of 3 qubits is contained within the 2-particle reduced density matrices@xcite . thus it makes sense to train our entanglement measure , to begin with , to the set of pairwise entanglements .",
    "fortunately in previous work@xcite we have already found a set of parameters that successfully maps the input state of a two - qubit system to a good approximation of the entanglement of formation , via the qubit - qubit correlation function at the final time , @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters were found by training with a set of just four inputs , as shown in table  [ inputs ] : a fully entangled state , a `` flat '' state ( equal amounts of all basis states ) , a correlated product state , and a partially entangled state .    for the three - qubit state abc",
    "there are three possible pairs : ab , ac , and bc ; and therefore three different pairwise entanglements to train . we therefore used@xcite a set of twelve training pairs : the four in table  [ inputs ] for each pair , outerproducted with @xmath41 for the unpaired qubit .",
    "so , for example , the @xmath42 state was taken to be @xmath43 , and was trained to give an output of 1 for the network output measure @xmath44 and zero for each of the output measures @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "table  [ train3 ] shows the target outputs and average calculated outputs after training ; detailed procedures and results are in @xcite .",
    "note that we report here the ; e.g. , the @xmath47 column numbers are the averages over @xmath48 ab , ac , and bc .",
    "( `` non-@xmath49 '' refers to the other two outputs for each pair ; there are six of these numbers . )",
    ".input matrices for training the pairwise quantum neural network ( qnn ) entanglement witnesses .",
    "each column is an input state , showing relative amounts of each of the basis states .",
    "the n - qubit system was trained on this set of four for each of the @xmath50 pairs ; this constituted the `` pairwise '' training . [ inputs ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "training of the three - qubit system required considerable time : 5000 epochs ( passes through the entire training set ) to get pairwise entanglement from the trained results for the two - qubit system@xcite . but",
    "training of the four - qubit system was ( unexpectedly ) easy .",
    "the training sets were , of course , larger : there are only three ways to entangle a pair of qubits , and only one way to entangle a triple , for the 3-qubit system , while the number of ways for the 4-qubit system are 6 and 4 , respectively , with one quad ( and so on , following the binomial coefficients . )",
    "however the 4-qubit system required much less training : only 100 epochs at each stage .",
    "the 5-qubit system was trained for 100 epochs at each stage , but 98% of the change in the parameters , as well as in the error reduction , had been accomplished by less than half that time , as shown in figure  [ 5q2err ] .",
    "successively larger systems still need to be trained to decrease initial errors ; yet the amount of training necessary seems to diminish with successive training stages .    , height=240 ]    figures  [ kev ] and [ ezev ] make this point graphically .",
    "they show the evolution of the tunneling , bias , and coupling parameters , from initial training of the 2-qubit system , through each stage of the training of the 3-qubit , 4-qubit , and 5-qubit systems .",
    "initially the qnn s learning entanglement requires large changes in the parameters , but as the size and complexity of the system is increased , the relative size of the changes decreases , till by stage 10 ( the 5-qubit system s training to the full set of 56 training pairs ) , changes in the parameters are just a few percent .",
    "note that in the two figures , the relative sizes of the final numbers ( root square percent change in @xmath51 is 3.6% ; in @xmath52 , 6.7% ) are comparable .",
    "this is reminiscent of the well - known neural network technique called `` bootstrapping''@xcite , in which knowledge of part of a pattern allows tentative inference about the rest ; in a sense , information about a smaller system can , in part , generalize to a larger .",
    "this makes us hopeful that this technique may be viable for use even on large systems .",
    ", for both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as a function of training stage .",
    "the sums are over the timeslices , and the differences are to each successive stage .",
    "stage 1 is 2-qubit training@xcite ; stage 2 , 3-qubit pairwise ; stage 3 , 3q pairwise plus 3-way ; stage 4 , 4q pairwise ; stage 5 , 4q pairwise plus 3-way ; stage 6 , 4q pairwise plus 3-way plus 4-way ; stage 7 , 5q pairwise ; stage 8 , 5q pairwise plus 3-way ; stage 9 , 5q pairwise plus 3-way plus 4-way ; stage 10 , 5q pairwise plus 3-way plus 4-way plus 5-way .",

    "these numbers change only very slightly when we look at so - called `` flipped '' w states@xcite instead ( where , instead of a single excitation shared among n qubits , we have a single 0 so shared - e.g. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "recently kimble et al.@xcite have succeeded in measuring the number of modes ( k ) sharing a single excitation photon ; while the qnn is not , of course , calculating exactly this , our results do show similar separations among states of different k.    , calculated by the qnn using the trained parameters listed in table  [ param ] , as a function of k. each data point is the average of the total entanglement for the @xmath58 states of the form w@xmath59 .",
    "error bars show the standard deviation at each point , which increases from from 0.7% , for the @xmath60 state , to 2.8% for the @xmath61 state . the line is drawn to guide the eye.[wvsk],height=240 ]",

    "when @xmath68 and @xmath66 , this is @xmath69 , which is the three - way w state in qubits abd . in terms of pairwise entanglement , a three - way w state is equally pairwise entangled in all three possible combinations ab , ad , and bd , so we would expect the red , green , and blue surfaces to come together at that point , while the yellow ( ac ) , cyan ( bc ) and magenta ( cd ) surfaces are zero there .",

    "we therefore used this same value for @xmath80 for each of the three pairs , in training the three - qubit system@xcite .",
    "the three - way w state @xmath81 is not a `` p '' state in any of the three pairs , of course , but it is related in the following sense : we can write @xmath82 , that is , an epr state in two of the qubits , plus a contamination term . in the same way , we can think of `` p '' as being a ( fully entangled ) epr state , plus an amount of contamination , the inclusion of which diminishes the entanglement .",
    "thus for self - consistency we would expect each of the pairwise entanglements of a w@xmath83 state to be approximately 0.44 , as in fact occurs .",
    "we can also look at states which have three - way ( or higher ) entanglement .",
    "figure  [ ghzbelltangle ] shows the pairwise ( red ) and three - way ( green ) entanglement of the states @xmath84 , calculated by the qnn using the trained 3-qubit system , as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and compared with the residual or 3-tangle of coffman@xcite ( magenta ) .",

    "each color corresponds to a different entanglement measure : red , pairwise ab entanglement , @xmath73 ; and blue , pairwise ac entanglement , @xmath74 , both computed by the qnn .",
    "compare these to @xmath90 , the tangle between a and b , in cyan ; and @xmath91 , the tangle between a and c , in yellow ( both computed analytically . )",
    "the residual tangle is identically zero for all these states , in agreement with the qnn s calculated @xmath88 , in green.[wtangle],height=243 ]    with the trained net , we can evaluate any pairwise or n - wise entanglement for mixed states , as well , without having to find an optimal decomposition@xcite .",
    "figure  [ wmx ] shows the computed entanglement of states of the form @xmath92 , as a function of both @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as expected from symmetry , all the pairwise entanglements lie atop one another , so only one is shown , for clarity ; all the three - way and four - way entanglements are zero . as",
    "this is a mixture , not a superposition , there is no interference among the three contributing states , and the @xmath93 and @xmath94 states contribute equivalently to the pairwise ( red ) entanglements .",

    "we have shown that a quantum system can be trained to compute its own degree of entanglement .",
    "no prior state reconstruction or tedious optimization procedure is necessary , nor is `` closeness '' to any particular state .",
    "we envision an experimental implementation in which parameters could be , to begin with , roughly estimated from simulations such as those presented here ( in the neural network literature , this is called `` offline '' or `` batch '' training@xcite . )",
    "these parameters could then be refined experimentally ( `` online '' training of the neural network . ) because the state of the system at each timeslice must be known in order to do quantum backprop , it can only be done in simulation ; some other parameter adjustment method would be needed experimentally , possibly a reinforcement or genetic algorithm .",
    "the experimental refinement procedure might also provide for the inclusion of features and interactions present in the physical state but not in the ( simplified ) model . in any case , once good values for the parameters are determined , any state s entanglement can be estimated by experimental measurement . and while we have only carried out simulations through a system size of 5 qubits , the additional training necessary significantly decreases as the size of the system grows , raising hopes for the method s feasibility even for large qubit networks",
    ".    it should be emphasized , though , that this method provides only an estimate of the entanglement ( a `` witness '' , not a `` measure . '' ) agreement with analytical results , while good , is not exact .",

    "further work is needed in this area , and is ongoing .",
    "that being said , we believe our present work is still of great value , providing as it does a way of bypassing difficult analytical work in addressing the need@xcite for experimental measurements to determine entanglement .",
    "moreover , our approach may have other important advantages .",
