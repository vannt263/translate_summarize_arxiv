    "majorana fermions ( mfs ) proposed by majorana@xcite in 1937 , with zero energy quantum particles described by hermitian second quantized operators @xmath0 , have attracted a great deal of one s attention due to their potential applications , e.g. , topological quantum computation@xcite .",
    "mfs , although originally proposed as a model for neutrinos , which have been detected in condensed matter systems@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that majorana particles could exist at the ends of 1d nanowires in the presence of the appropriate superconducting pairing@xcite under suitable conditions .",
    "not long ago , some researches show that using a heterostructure consisted of two conventional materials such as s - wave superconductor and semiconductor nanowire with strong spin - orbit coupling , one can generate mfs @xcite .",
    "although a few schemes have been proved that mfs dwell in solid state systems , experimental observation majorana bound states ( mbss ) are still a challenging , and if the direct experimental observation of majorana particles is achieved  in solid state systems , there would be a breakthrough on the research of fundamental physics and the future quantum computertudor .",
    "fortunately , very recently , some experiment reports have been shown that the existence of a pair of mbss are observed at the ends of the different materials nanowire  which contact with an superconductor via zero bias conductance peak@xcite and fractional ac josephson effect@xcite .  actually , besides these schemes , mbss could also be probed via quantum non - locality , transconductance , interference@xcite , and the noise measurements@xcite , as well as 4@xmath1 periodic majorana - josephson currents@xcite .    up to now , the detection of mfs in condensed matter systems based on the electrical measurements is the mainstream approachdeng , mourik : sci12,das , rokhinson .",
    "however , how to detect and verify the definite mbss is still challenging@xcite , because the noises that may confuse the mbss signals  will be involved in the electrical measurement schemes , and they will affect the judgement whether  the majorana - like signals are true mbss .",
    "moreover , these methods also include the electron transfer into or out of mbss via the nanowire , which will destroy the qubit information when mbss are used to quantum computing . in this case",
    ", one proposes an experimental setup for detecting a majorana zero mode by employing a single quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to the end of a p - wave superconducting nanowire@xcite .",
    "this scheme provides a potential way to probe mbss without totally destroying the information in the qubit . besides , leijnse et al .",
    "present  a setup to measure the lifetime of majorana bound states via a qd coupled to a semiconducting wire with a superconductivity@xcite .    on the other hand , the suspended carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , due to their remarkable electronic properties , low masses and high - q factors witkamp : nl06,jespersen : np11,eichler : nn11 , attract more and more people s attention .",
    "these advantages will make the cnts more applicable to ultrasensitive detection and mechanical signal processing benjamin : sci09 .",
    "recently , the investigation of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in cnts has gained significant advances , which pave the way for manipulating the spin degree of freedom kuemmeth : nat08,arcizet : np11,kuemmeth : mt10,struck : prl12,li : sr12 .",
    "based on these advantages of cnts , rather than the detection schememourik : sci12,rokhinson , das , benjamin , walter and what stanescu et al.tudor elaborated , here , we shall propose a novel optical measurement scheme to detect the existence of majorana fermion by using an electron spin trapped on a carbon nanotube resonator as a sensitive probe .",
    "we employ the optical pump - probe scheme ( see fig .",
    "1 ) which has been demonstrated experimentally@xcite to detect majorana fermion via the probe - absorption spectrum . the vibration of cnt ( i.e. the phonon cavity ) enhances the probe spectrum , which makes the majorana fermion more sensitive to be detected .",
    "moreover , the scheme also provide a method to measure the lifetimes of majorana fermion distinguishing the electrical measurement@xcite .",
    "the schematic setup is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where an electron spin trapped on the suspended cnt@xcite is employed to detect a pair of majorana fermions emerged  at the ends of the tunnel - coupled nanowiremourik : sci12 . in the presence of a magnetic field * b * , it constitutes a well - defined two - level spin system ( tls ) with an effective spin - phonon coupling due to the interplay between soi and flexural vibrations of the nanotube@xcite .",
    "the vibrational modes of nanotube resonator can be treated as phonon modes .",
    "the inset window of fig.1 shows the two - level spin state , while dressing with the flexural modes of cnt via the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling mechanism is presented , where at long phonon wavelengths the deflection coupling is dominated , while at short wavelengths the deformation potential coupling should be dominated@xcite .    for simplicity",
    "we consider only the deflection coupling mechanism , but note that the approach can readily be extended to include both effects .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this system is @xcite@xmath2where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the curvature enhanced spin - orbit coupling and the inter - valley coupling , respectively . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pauli matrices in valley and spin space , @xmath7 is the tangent vector along the cnt axis , and @xmath8 is the magnetic field along the axis of the suspended cnt . in order to study how electron spin couples to the quantized mechanical motion of the cnt",
    ", we consider only a single polarization of flexural motion , assuming that the two - fold degeneracy is broken ( for example , driven by an external electric field ) .",
    "a generic deformation of the cnt with deflection @xmath9 makes the tangent vector @xmath10 coordinate - dependent . expanding @xmath10 for small deflections , the coupling terms in hamiltonian ( 1 )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath11 and @xmath12 . expressing the deflection @xmath9 in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a quantized flexural phonon mode @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the waveform and zero - point amplitude of the phonon .",
    "thus , we obtain the hamiltonian of the suspended cnt system as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 denotes the magnetic field strength and @xmath21 is spin magnetic moment .",
    "@xmath22 is the vibrational frequency of the nanotube resonator .",
    "@xmath23 is the spin - phonon coupling strength in cnt@xcite .    for the nanowire structure ,",
    "combining a strong rashba spin - orbit interaction and zeeman splitting , the proximity - effect - induced s - wave superconductivity in the nanowire can support electron - hole quasiparticle excitations of mbss at the ends of the nanowire@xcite .",
    "suppose the electron spin couples to @xmath24 , then the hamiltonian that describes the mbss@xcite is @xmath25 . to detect the existence of majorana fermion ,",
    "it is helpful to switch from the majorana representation to the regular fermion one through the exact transformation @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the fermion annihilation and creation operators obeying the anti - commutative relation @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath32 can be rewritten as @xmath33 , where the first term gives the energy of majorana fermion at frequency @xmath34 , the second term describes the coupling between the right mbss and the electron spin in cnt with the coupling strength @xmath35 . applying a strong pump field and a weak probe field to the spin of an electron simultaneously .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the electron spin coupled to the pump field and probe field is given by@xcite @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dipole moment of the electron , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the frequency of the pump field and the probe field , respectively and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the slowly varying envelope of the pump field ( probe field ) .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the total hamiltonian of the system in the presence of two optical excitation@xcite . in a rotating frame at the pump field frequency @xmath38 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written by @xmath42where @xmath43 is the detuning of the exciton frequency and the pump frequency , @xmath44 is the rabi frequency of the pump field , and @xmath45 is the probe - pump detuning .",
    "@xmath46 is the detuning of the majorana fermion frequency and the pump frequency .",
    "actually , we have neglected the regular fermion like normal electrons in the nanowire that interact with the qd in the above discuss . to describe the interaction between the normal electrons and the qd , we use the tight binding hamiltonian of the whole wire as @xcite : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the regular fermion annihilation and creation operators with energy @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 obeying the anti - commutative relation @xmath52 , and @xmath23 is the coupling strength between the normal electrons and the qd ( here for simplicity we have neglected the @xmath51-dependence of @xmath23 as in ref.@xcite ) .    according to the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath53 $ ] and introducing the corresponding damping and noise terms",
    ", we derive the quantum langevin equations as follows @xcite@xmath54@xmath55@xmath56@xmath57where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the electron spontaneous emission rate and dephasing rate , @xmath60 is the decay rate of cnt and @xmath61 is the decay rate of the majorana fermion .",
    "@xmath62 is the @xmath63-correlated langevin noise operator , which has zero mean @xmath64 and obeys the correlation function @xmath65 .",
    "the resonator mode of cnt is affected by a brownian stochastic force with zero mean value , and @xmath66 has the correlation function @xmath67 $ ] , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the boltzmann constant and the temperature of the reservoir of the coupled system .",
    "majorana fermion has the same correlation relation as resonator mode of cnt .    to go beyond weak coupling ,",
    "the heisenberg operator can be rewritten as the sum of its steady - state mean value and a small fluctuation with zero mean value : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . since",
    "the driving fields are weak , but classical coherent fields , we will identify all operators with their expectation values , and drop the quantum and thermal noise termswalls , weis : sci10 . simultaneously inserting these operators into the langevin equations eqs .",
    "( 3)-(6 ) and neglecting the nonlinear term @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the linearized langevin equations can be written as:@xmath78@xmath79@xmath80@xmath81accordingly , we can obtain the corresponding steady - state equations and from these equations we get : @xmath82+w_{0}[g^{2}(\\delta _ { m}^{2}+\\kappa _ { m}^{2}/4)(2\\delta _ { pu}\\delta _ { m}-\\gamma _ { 2}\\kappa _ { m})+\\beta ^{2}(2\\delta _ { pu}\\delta _ { m}+\\gamma _ { 2}\\kappa _ { m})]\\}-2\\omega _ { pu}^{2}w_{0}[3\\kappa g^{2}(\\delta _ { m}^{2}+\\kappa _ { m}^{2}/4)+\\kappa _ { m}\\beta ^{2}(\\delta _ { n}^{2}+\\kappa ^{2}/4)]+4\\omega _ { pu}^{2}w_{0}\\gamma _ { 2}(\\delta _ { m}^{2}+\\kappa _ { m}^{2}/4)(\\delta _ { n}^{2}+\\kappa ^{2}/4)=0 $ ] which determines the population inversion ( @xmath83 ) of the electron in cnt .    in order to solve eqs .",
    "( 7)-(10 ) , we make the ansatz@xcite @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . substituting these equations into eqs .",
    "( 7)-(10 ) , and working to the lowest order in @xmath41 but to all orders in @xmath40 , we can obtain the linear susceptibility as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is given by@xmath90where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be derived from the steady - state equations and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98/(\\gamma _ { 1}-i\\delta ) $ ] , @xmath99/(\\gamma _ { 1}-i\\delta ) $ ] , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 indicates the conjugate of @xmath106 ) .",
    "the quantum langevin equations of the normal electrons coupled to cnt have the same form as majorana fermions , therefore , we omit its derivation and only give the results in the following section .",
    "the electron with spin trapped inside the center of cnt couples to the nearby majorana fermion in insb nanowire in the simultaneous presence of a strong pump beam and a weak probe beam as shown in fig.1 . for illustration of the numerical results , here",
    "we use the realistic experimental parameters@xcite : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and the coupling strength between the electron spin and the nanotube vibrational mode @xmath110 . for majorana fermion , there are no experimental values for the lifetime of the majorana fermion and the coupling strength between the electron spin and majorana bound states as far as we know . however , according to a few reports @xcite",
    ", we assume that the order of magnitudes of these two parameters are in the range of megahertz , while in our letter , we consider the coupling strength @xmath111 and the lifetime of the majorana fermion @xmath112 . when the electron spin in cnt couples to the nearby mbs and produces the coupled states @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 denotes the number states of the majorana bound states ) as shown in the inset of fig . 1 .",
    "when radiating a strong pump field and a weak probe field on this system , we can detect the existence of a majorana fermion via the coupling between majorana bound states and the electron spin in cnt from the probe absorption spectrum .",
    "2(a ) shows the absorption spectrum of the probe field ( i.e.,the imaginary part of the dimensionless susceptibility @xmath116 ) as a function of the probe - spin detuning @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) with several different coupling strengths @xmath119 . the black solid curve is the result when no majorana bound states exists in the nanowire .",
    "as majorana bound states appears at the ends of the nanowire , the electron spin in cnt will couple to the right majorana bound states , which induces the upper level of the state @xmath120 to split into @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the two peaks presented in fig .",
    "2(a ) with a given coupling strength @xmath35 indicate the spin - mbs interaction . as shown in the low two insets of fig .",
    "2(a ) , the left peak signifies the transition from @xmath123 to @xmath124 while the right peak is due to the transition of @xmath125 to @xmath114 . to determine this signature is the true majorana bound states that appear in the nanowire , rather than the normal electrons that couple with the qd",
    ", we give the numerical results of the normal electrons in the nanowire that couple with the qd as shown in the upper right inset of fig.2(a ) . in order to compare with the majorana signature",
    ", the parameters are chosen the same as majorana fermion s parameters .",
    "we find that there is no signal in the probe absorption spectrum ( see the red solid line in the inset of fig.2(a ) ) which means that the splitting of the probe absorption spectrum is the true signature of mbs .",
    "therefore , our result here reveals that the splitting in the probe absorption is a real signature of mbs , and the stronger coupling strength introduces the wider and deeper dip .",
    "furthermore , the distance of the splitting becomes larger and larger with increasing the coupling strength @xmath35 , which obviously reveals the spin - mbss coupling . from fig .",
    "2(b ) we find that the distance of the splitting is twice times larger than the spin - mbss coupling strength , which provides a concise way to measure the spin - mbs coupling strength in this coupled system . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we give a linear relationship between the distance of the peak splitting and the spin - mbs coupling strength . therefore , the coupling strength can be obtained immediately by directly measuring the distance of two peaks in the probe absorption spectrum .",
    "3 demonstrates the behavior of the lifetime of the majorana fermion when the pump field is resonant with the frequency of the electron spin in cnt . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the relationship between the transmission and the lifetime of the majorana fermion .",
    "it shows that the transmission of the probe field decreases with the increase of the decay rate of the majorana fermion .",
    "this figure provides us a simple method to measure the decay rate of the majorana fermion . through this method",
    ", we can determine the decay rate of the majorana fermion and further investigate its relation with the environment via the transmission spectrum of the probe field .    in order to demonstrate the function of the vibration in cnt , we plot fig .",
    "4 presents the absorption spectrum of the probe field as a function of the probe detuning @xmath117 with different coupling strengths @xmath23 . in fig .",
    "4 , three couplings strength @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 are considered .",
    "@xmath129 means that there is no spin - phonon coupling in the suspended cnt , the two sharp peaks in the absorption spectrum still appear .",
    "however , once the spin - phonon coupling turns on and increases the coupling to the realistic experimental value @xmath130 @xcite , the two peaks of the absorption spectrum becomes more significant than that without the spin - phonon coupling in cnt , which means that the vibration of cnt ( i.e. the phonon cavity ) enhances the probe spectrum and makes the majorana fermion more sensitive to be detected .",
    "this phonon cavity enhanced effect is analogous to the optical cavity enhanced effect in quantum opticsstapfner .",
    "in conclusion , a novel scheme which consists of an electron spin trapped on the suspended carbon nanotube and a tunnel - coupled semiconductor nanowire for demonstrating the existence of a majorana fermion is proposed according to spin - based optomechanics .",
    "based on this scheme , we propose a simple method to determine the interaction constant of the spin - majorana bound states and the decay rate of the majorana fermion via the probe absorption spectrum . due to the phonon cavity",
    "enhanced effect , the majorana fermion becomes more and more easier to be detected in this coupled system .",
