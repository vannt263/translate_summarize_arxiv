    "we use instead a superimposed tilde to denote an _ unordered _ set of @xmath1 numbers : for instance the notation @xmath10 denotes the _ unordered _ set of @xmath1 numbers @xmath11 , say , the @xmath1 zeros of a polynomial of degree @xmath1 in @xmath0 .",
    "upper - case * boldface * letters denote @xmath12 matrices : for instance the matrix @xmath13 features the @xmath14 elements @xmath15 .",

    "the _ imaginary unit _ is hereafter denoted as @xmath16 , implying of course @xmath17 . for quantities depending on the _ real _ independent variable @xmath18 ( time ) ,",
    "superimposed dots indicate differentiation with respect to it : so , for instance , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; but often the @xmath18-dependence is not explicitly indicated , whenever this is unlikely to cause any misunderstanding ( as , for instance , in the second formula we just wrote and below in ( [ iden1 ] ) ) .",
    "the kronecker symbol @xmath21 has the usual meaning : @xmath22 if @xmath23 , @xmath24 if @xmath25 ; and we denote below as @xmath26 the _ unit _ @xmath12 matrix the elements of which are @xmath21 .",

    "finally , the prime appended to a sum ( see for instance below ( [ iden1 ] ) and also note the simplification it would imply for  ( [ sigma1 ] ) ) indicates that the sum runs  over the indicated indices , in the identified range  with the additional restrictions that these indices be _ all different among themselves _ and moreover _ all different from the `` outside '' index _ ( which is for instance @xmath51 in ( [ iden1 ] ) ) ; note that this sum becomes void hence vanishes identically",
