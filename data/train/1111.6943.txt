    "gi fragmentation is complicated by the tendency of fragments to migrate inward ; if they reach the star , they could produce jumps in accretion luminosity like those of fu orionis outbursts ( vorobyov & basu 2005 , 2006 ; but see zhu et al .  2010a , b for an alternative model ) .",
    "if the migration stops at the inner disk , it may provide a formation mechanism for close binary systems (  7.1 ) .",
    "the variety of clump masses obtained in previous simulations suggests gi - induced fragmentation depends on the initial condition of the disks , which should be determined by both the rate of infall and the mass of the growing central star .",
    "a more realistic treatment of gi requires consideration of both the way in which mass is loaded onto the disk as infall proceeds , and irradiation heating of the outer disk by the central star ; the latter is known to weaken and/or suppress gi ( cai et al .",
    "recent analytic studies ( levin 2007 ; rafikov 2009 ; cossins et al .",
    "2010 ; zhu et al .",
    "2010b ) have shown that irradiation may even suppress fragmentation beyond 50 au .",
    "however , simulations with a large parameter space have not been carried out to confirm these analytic studies .",
    "investigations of the evolution of clumps have been limited so far , largely because of numerical difficulties .",
    "most 3d hydrodynamic simulations use arithmetically spaced computational grids in the radial direction , which can only cover a relatively small range of radii .",
    "their limited resolution also makes it difficult to resolve the collapsing clump .",
    "particle - based sph simulations can also suffer from deficient numbers of particles , especially in 3d ( nelson 2006 ) .",
    "many initial attempts to treat disk cooling in sph simulations have only applied the orbital cooling prescription which leads to a runaway collapse .",
    "recent studies have more realistic radiative transfer treatment implemented for both grid based ( e.g. boley 2009 ) and sph ( e.g. stamatellos & whitworth 2008 , forgan et al .  2009 , 2010 , boley 2009 , rogers & wadsley 2011 ) calculations .",
    "but since 3d simulations are time consuming , long timescale high - resolution simulations that can follow clump evolution are only feasible in 2d .",
    "while some analytic work has been done ( nayakshin 2010abc ) to explore long - term clump evolution , the migration process is simplified , and further mass growth through gas accretion is ignored once the clump has formed . furthermore , 2d simulations enable us to study clump formation in a large parameter space of both disk and infall properties .    in order to study gi - induced disk fragmentation under the influence of both irradiation and mass infall , we have carried out high - resolution two - dimensional ( 2d ) hydrodynamic simulations with thermal physics included simply .",
    "we show how fragmentation depends upon the mass infall rate and the mass infall radius .",
    "furthermore , with high resolution long - timescale simulations , we are able to trace the clump evolution . we find that clumps migrate inward rapidly , unless they become massive enough to open gaps , and the accretion rate onto the clump is usually high due to the large cross section .",
    "inward migrating clumps can be subject to tidal destruction as they migrate inward because of their shrinking hill radii .",
    "but the detailed accretion physics around the clump and the dynamically unstable second core phase complicates this issue .    in  2",

    "we use the fargo - adsg code ( baruteau & masset 2008 ) in a two dimensional ( @xmath7 ) fixed polar grid .",
    "fargo - adsg is an extended version of fargo ( masset 2000 ) , which uses a finite difference scheme with standard source and transport steps that are similar to zeus ( stone et al .",
    "however , additional orbital advection has been applied which removes the average azimuthal velocity so that truncation error is reduced and the timestep allowed by the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition is significantly increased .",
    "thus fargo - adsg enables us to perform high resolution simulations over long timescales .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the central star acceleration due to the non - axisymmetric potential of the disk is included as an indirect potential term in the fluid equations ( baruteau & masset 2008 ) .",

    "we set @xmath39 to have the constant value @xmath40 , which is roughly what is expected for flared disks ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; chiang & goldreich 1997 ; dalessio et al .",

    "the effect of infall onto the disk is represented by f@xmath27 , f@xmath27 and e@xmath27 in eqs",
    "f@xmath27 and e@xmath27 are the rate of disk mass and internal energy increase per unit area due to the infall , which can be directly derived from an envelope infall model .",
    "the form of f@xmath27 , however , is less immediately apparent ; it is the equivalent shear force induced from merging infalling mass with the disk mass when they have different velocities .",
    "the relationship between f@xmath27 and the azimuthal velocity of the infalling envelope can be derived if we write the angular momentum equation from eqs .",
    "[ eq : mass ] and [ eq : momen ] @xmath43 where @xmath44",

    "if the infalling envelope has the same velocity as the disk rotational velocity ( @xmath48 ) , there is no shear between the disk and the infalling envelope and f@xmath49=0 .    in our simulations",
    ", we minimize the envelope s impact on the disk by assuming f@xmath50 in order to study the disk s response just to the mass loading from the infalling envelope .",
    "this is actually not a bad approximation based on the rigid rotating envelope infall model of @xcite and cassen & moosman ( 1981 ) , which suggest most of the infalling material falls onto the centrifugal radius ( @xmath51 ) where it has just slightly less than keplerian rotation ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this also implies f@xmath53=0 . in our simulation",
    "we add mass to the disk within a small range in radii ( @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) according to @xmath56 so that by integrating over @xmath54 to @xmath55 the total infall rate is @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 is chosen to be 0.75 so that the disk within @xmath54 and @xmath55 has the same @xmath59 during the infall as if the disk is irradiation dominated ( see eq .",
    "we also assume that the infalling material has a temperature equal to @xmath42 such that @xmath60 this is not precisely correct ; backwarming from the envelope can actually heat the disk .",
    "we ignore this effect for simplicity in our simulations , but we discuss its possible impact in  7.2 .      currently , most simulations studying gi start with massive and non - irradiated disks . in such cases",
    "the occurence or otherwise of fragmentation depends upon the initial conditions ( boley 2009 ) . without external heating ( irradiation ) ,",
    "a disk with a finite initial temperature can cool to a point such that the toomre parameter @xmath61 , where @xmath35 is the epicyclic frequency , and the disk becomes gravitationally unstable . the equivalent orbital cooling time ( @xmath62 )",
    "sensitively depends on the initial surface density distribution , @xmath63 in the optically thick , viscous heating dominated case @xmath64 and the cooling time becomes @xmath65 where we have assumed that @xmath59 is constant to constrain the temperature , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a constant , and the disk follows the keplerian rotation law ( so that @xmath68 ) in obtaining the final proportionality relation . since @xmath69 for our grain opacity ( appendix a ) , larger initial surface densities at larger radii lead to shorter cooling times and fragmentation .    during a realistic star formation process",
    "the disk is built up over a finite time from the infall of the parent molecular cloud core .",
    "thus the initial conditions depend on the mass and angular momentum distribution within the cloud , which can be quite complicated , and in any event are poorly constrained .",
    "moreover , the thermal history of the disk can affect disk fragmentation ( clarke et al .",
    "2007 ) . to simulate the disk mass growth from infall until it becomes gravitationally unstable",
    "we start with a relatively low mass disk and then gradually add mass to the disk at a constant rate . when the disk becomes massive enough and gravitationally unstable , spiral",
    "arms generated by the gi will transport the infalling mass to the central star at a rate matching the infall rate if the system can achieve a steady - state . with this procedure",
    ", we avoid strong relaxation at the beginning of our simulations which may cause fragmentation due only to initial conditions ; this turns out to be important for simulation convergence , discussed in  2.3 .",
    "it also allows us to control the infall rates and infall radii as two free parameters .",
    "we have performed a variety of simulations with infall at different rates and radii .",
    "since the disk undergoing gi tries to accrete to match the infall rate , @xmath70 in order to maintain @xmath711 , we can vary @xmath57 to control the disk accretion rate .",
    "these simulations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "different cases are named as r+infall radii+infall rates .",
    "thus r40_3e-4 means the typical infall radii is 40 au , while the infall rate at @xmath72 40 au is @xmath73 .",
    "the special cases have notations after the infall rates which are self - explanatory or explained in the footnote . in the standard cases , the azimuthal grid resolution is 512 .",
    "we use logarithmically spaced radial grids and choose the radial resolution such that every grid cell has the same azimuthal and radial size . in most of our simulations the radial resolution is @xmath72 400 , with the inner radius at 5 or 10 au and the outer radius at 1000 or 1500 au ( see table 1 ) . we set @xmath39=0.1 in eq .",
    "[ eq : text ] , so that @xmath74 ( or t@xmath75(1 au)=215 k with irradiation heating only ) .",
    "the initial disk surface density is @xmath76 g @xmath77 with an exponential cut - off beyond @xmath55 ( obtained by multiplying the surface density by the factor @xmath78 if @xmath79 , where @xmath55 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : infallfin ] ) . with this setup , the disk is gravitationally stable ( @xmath712 ) within @xmath55 , and the disk surface density is extremely small close to the outer boundary at @xmath6 au .",
    "with infall , the disk gradually becomes gravitationally unstable near infall radii ; spiral arms develop and start transporting mass inwards , resulting in the inner disk gradually becoming gravitationally unstable .",
    "we ran our simulations for up to 5@xmath410@xmath80 years for non - fragmenting cases .",
    "if the disk fragments , we run the simulation until a clump is close to the inner boundary and causes negative densities ( details in appendix b ) .",
    "( in the r200_3e-6 case we ran the simulation for 2@xmath410@xmath81 years to test whether this disk fragments on a longer timescale . )",
    "a timescale of 5@xmath410@xmath80 years is not much smaller than the estimated length of the infall phase for low - mass protostars , and it is equivalent to 17 orbits at our largest infall radius ( 200 au ) , long enough to see if the disk will fragment .",
    "we assume the central protostar has a fixed mass ( m@xmath5 ) throughout our simulations in order to study the disk response to the mass infall only .",
    "thus our simulations are approximating the disk evolution near the end of protostellar collapse , when the central object is quite massive and emits significant radiation .",
    "the expected mass of the gi disk from @xmath82 to @xmath83 can be estimated by assuming @xmath84 with the temperature set by our irradiation prescription ( eq .  [ eq : text ] ) : @xmath85 with r@xmath86=100 au and r@xmath27=10 au , we have @xmath87 m@xmath5 .",
    "thus the disk is massive compared with the central star if irradiation is considered .    to study how irradiation affects fragmentation , we ran three additional simulations with high , low , and no irradiation , respectively . the high irradiation case , r200_3e-5l100 , is similar to r200_3e-5 but with 100 @xmath88 , typical of an a type star . on the contrary ,",
    "the decreasing irradiation case , r100_1e-5i , is similar to case r100_1e-5 , but after 5@xmath410@xmath80 years , with the same infall rate , the irradiation parameter in eq .",
    "[ eq : text ] gradually decreases at a rate @xmath89 until the disk fragments .",
    "equation [ eq : frt ] is chosen so that the disk scale height due to irradiation decreases linearly with time and the disk mass decreases linearly with time ( assuming @xmath90constant )",
    ". the resulting mass accretion rate due to the decreasing irradiation is much smaller than the infall rate at r@xmath9185 au , so the disk accretion rate is still controlled by the infall rate .",
    "finally , we performed one simulation similar to r200_3e-6 but without irradiation at all , which is labeled as r200_3e-6noirr .",
    "the entire suite of parameters explored in our simulations is summarized in table 1 .      to explore how robust our simulations are ,",
    "we have carried out simulations with different settings .",
    "the most important issue is the convergence on the fragmentation criterion raised by meru & bate 2011 .",
    "some other issues include the @xmath18 value and the gravitational force smoothing length .      to study whether the critical fragmentation radius depends on the numerical resolution",
    ", we have re - calculated several marginal fragmentation and non - fragmentation cases , but with double the resolution in both radial and azimuthal directions as shown in table 1 .",
    "non - fragmentation cases remain non - fragmenting at higher resolution and the fragmentation case still fragments .",
    "a particular concern applies to the non - fragmentation case , in which numerical dissipation may prevent disk fragmentation .",
    "thus , for r100_1e-5 case , we double and even quadruple the resolution in both radial and azimuthal direction , but the disk still remains non - fragmenting .",
    "we want to point out that the irradiated disk has larger scale height which is better resolved numerically .",
    "we conclude that an azimuthal resolution of 512 cells is enough to study disk fragmentation , which is expected considering each disk scale height is resolved by 7.5 grid cells at 100 au ( considering @xmath92 ) and the neutral stability critical wavelength ( @xmath93 for @xmath84 ) is resolved by 45 grid cells , far larger than that required by the condition given in nelson ( 2006 ) .",
    "recent sph simulations by meru & bate ( 2011 ) have questioned the convergence of the orbital cooling fragmentation criterion for gi disks .",
    "however , in our resolution tests from 512 to 2048 azimuthal grid cells and the corresponding quadruple resolution increase in the radial direction , our results converged for both non - fragmenting and fragmenting disks .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the fact that we gradually build the disk from a gravitationally stable state to an unstable state by adding mass to the disk .",
    "this process not only simulates the real astronomical condition of infall but also allows the disk to regulate itself . in a sense",
    "this is similar to clark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who increased disk cooling gradually .",
    "simulations by paardekooper et al .",
    "( 2011 ) confirmed that the treatment in clark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) leads to a convergent cooling criterion , which is consistent with our finding that gradually built - up disks converge .      the two dimensional adiabatic index @xmath18 is related to the three dimensional @xmath94 in the static limit ( e.g. , goldreich et al .",
    "1986 ) . in a strongly self - gravitating disk , @xmath95 . if the three dimensional @xmath96 , the two dimensional @xmath18=11/7@xmath72 1.57 . we explore both the quasi - steady gi and highly dynamic fragmenting states ,",
    "so it is not obvious what @xmath18 value we should choose .",
    "we have simulated two cases , non - fragmenting and fragmenting disks , with both @xmath18=1.4 and 1.57 ( table 1 ) .",
    "our results suggest that the fragmentation criterion does not depend sensitively on @xmath18 in the range from 1.4 to 1.57 .",
    "this is consistent with rice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . on the other hand , boley et al .",

    ", we use a smoothed gravitational force ( baruteau & masset 2008 ) . considering that the disk vertical structure can smooth the disk s global gravitational potential , we assume a smoothing length of 0.0264 r , which is 0.6 disk scale height at 5 au and 0.3 disk scale height at 100 au . since a large smoothing length may lead to bigger clumps , we have carried out one simulation with smoothing length of 10 times smaller . the clump mass from this simulation turns out to be close to the clump mass from the corresponding large smoothing length simulation .",
    "this is consistent with baruteau et al .",

    "higher infall rates at the same radius ( moving from left to right along a row in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2map2 ] ) also lead to more unstable spiral arms .",
    "similarly , fragmentation becomes more severe ( one clump to multiple clumps ) with higher infall rates at the same radius .",

    "a comparison simulation that maintains full irradiation ( run r100_1e-5 ) , which is shown in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : figclump2 ] , does not fragment .",
    "we thus confirm that irradiation tends to suppress fragmentation at fixed infall rate .",

    "this also suggests that for high - luminosity systems ( where @xmath99 l@xmath5 ) gravitational instability can transfer mass inwards smoothly from hundreds of au ; an analytic treatment of this result is given in  6.1 .",
    "in a fragmenting disk , clump formation and evolution should resemble protostar formation and evolution ( larson 1969 , bodenheimer et al .  1980 ) . during disk / cloud fragmentation , a quasi - hydrostatic core forms (",
    "this stage is called the `` first core '' in protostellar studies ) .",
    "when the core s central temperature rises from @xmath721500 - 2000 k , the dust sublimates , then hydrogen molecules begin to dissociate . at this point",
    "the ratio of specific heats @xmath18 decreases below 4/3 , the clump becomes dynamically unstable and it collapses to form the so - called `` second core '' ( larson 1969 ) .",
    "in our 2d simulations we can not simulate the dynamically unstable `` second core '' , and whenever dust sublimates at the midplane our assumption that the disk has uniform opacity vertically becomes invalid .",
    "thus , although we allow the clump to be heated up above 1500 k , our results at those stages are not accurate .",
    "whenever the clump is above 2000 k and the center of the clump has collapsed to the `` second core '' , a circum - clump disk will form , and its accretion becomes important for the clump s further growth . in this paper , we focus on the `` first core '' stage . even for this stage , we found there are three distinct fates for the clumps . during the clump s inward migration ,",
    "if the clump grows massive enough to open a gap , it slows down or even stops migration . on the other hand ,",
    "if the clump fails to open a gap , continuous migration can eventually lead to tidal destruction .",
    "there is a third possibility that the clump manages to migrate inward all the way to the central star without being tidally destroyed .",
    "since our inner boundary is at @xmath72 10 au , we can not follow the clump all the way to the central star to confirm this possibility , but provide further analytic estimates to investigate this in  6.2 .",
    "nonetheless , our simulations do exhibit clumps that manage to reach the inner boundary of the computational domain without being tidally disrupted .",
    "we want to emphasize that all the clumps studied hereinafter are limited to the marginally fragmentation cases , in which only one or two clumps form in the disk .",
    "they do not suffer the strong clump - clump scattering seen in cases of multiple fragmentation , which complicates their evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2grid ] shows the clump from the run r100_3e-5 with the numerical grid overlaid on the surface density distribution .",
    "the left panel shows the clump when it first forms at 150 au after 2.2@xmath410@xmath80 years , and the right panel shows its density 2000 years later when it has migrated in to 50 au .",

    "figure [ fig : relt ] shows the temperature distribution of the clump ( corresponding to the right panel of figure [ fig : fig2grid ] ) .",
    "velocity vectors are superimposed showing the velocity field measured in a frame rotating at the same rate as the centre of the clump .",
    "shocked regions form at the edges of the clump where the infalling material from the disk collides with the pressure - supported clump ( a similar phenomenon is observed in the 1d simulations by larson 1969 ) .",
    "as the clump accretes gas with high relative angular momentum , it develops significant rotation ( 2 km s@xmath100 , compared with the keplerian rotation speed of 4 km s@xmath100 in the clump rotating reference frame , as discussed in detail below ) .",
    "the prograde clump rotation is similar to that seen in simulations of circumplanetary disks ( lubow et al .",
    "1999 ) , presumably because of a similar flow pattern occurring as gas enters the clump hill sphere from the surrounding protostellar disk .",

    "thus an energy equation is required to derive the clump s evolution .",
    "the approach we will take is quite similar to the protostellar birthline calculations by hartmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but instead of considering energy conservation , we consider the conservation of the jacobi - like energy integral ( @xmath94 ) in a frame corotating with the clump .",

    "subsequent tidal disruption of the clump during inward migration may then lead to the removal of the gas envelope , leaving a surviving rocky body in the disk .",
    "our simulations suggest the tidal destruction of the envelope can happen and may not be rare ( 4 out of 13 cases ) if the disk fragments .",
    "whether the solid core can form is beyond the scope of this paper ( see cha & nayakshin 2011 ) .",
    "our simulations have several simplifications which require further consideration .",
    "first , our disks are subject to mass infall all the time .",
    "if the disk fragments while there is no mass replenishment by infall , the clumps at the outer edge of the disk may not necessarily migrate inwards ; in other words , small fragments formed near the end of infall may have the best chance of survival at large radii .",
    "a second issue is that we have assumed axisymmetric , smooth infall , which may not be the most typical case .",
    "strong non - axisymmetric perturbations in the infalling material can aid fragmentation ( burkert & bodenheimer 1993 ) .",
    "we do not explore such large perturbations in order to develop well - conditioned numerical simulations .",
    "we emphasize that the two - dimensional nature of our simulations , while enabling us to study clump formation and evolution over long timescales , necessarily omits three - dimensional effects which could be important , such as wave propagation in a stratified disk ( ogilvie & lubow 1999 ) .",
    "however , the fragmentation occurs at large radii , where we expect the disk to be more nearly vertically isothermal due to the dominance of irradiation heating .",
    "of more concern is the crude treatment of the radiative cooling for clump evolution , which may differ significantly in three dimensions .",
    "finally , we have limited the calculations to a constant value of @xmath18 , and have not considered possible instabilities related to , for example , molecular hydrogen rotational thermalization or dissociation .",
    "considering our limitations , a comparison with existing 3-d simulations is necessary .",

    "( 2010a ) have shown that the disk fragments when @xmath2481 and the clumps are quite massive .",
    "however they used a piecewise polytropic equation of state .",
    "harsono et al.(2011 ) suggested that infall has weakened the disk fragmentation , in other words the critical @xmath157 for fragmentation is large .",
    "this seems to be consistent with our results .",
    "but caution has to be made that we put infall manually by adding disk mass and no shear between the infall and the disk has been set up .",
    "we also used radiative cooling instead of orbital cooling as harsono et al .",

    "this is similar to what we have found in our simulations . but",
    "again , our simple equation of state introduces uncertainties in the disk dynamics and the thermal structure of the clumps .",
    "although theoretically the clump evolution and fate is complicated by the disk infall history , and clump accretion / migration , observations may provide us clues on the formation mechanism for giant planets found at large distances ( e.g. fomalhaut , hr 8799 ) by measuring the metallicity of these planets ( helled & bodenheimer 2010 , 2011 ) .",

    "[ eq : irr ] , and the four orders of magnitude variation in luminosity between the a type star and the brown dwarf .",
    "the lowest fragmentation accretion rate is limited by the minimum disk temperature which equals the envelope temperature .",
    "this analytic estimate is confirmed by the r200_3e-5l100 case where the disk did not fragment .",
    "we want to emphasize that currently found far away planets ( @xmath9150 au ) by direct imaging technique are around a type stars ( e.g. hr 8799 ) . due to the stronger irradiation",
    ", the disk needs to be more massive to be gravitationally unstable and the clumps produced by gi can be more massive than our simulation produced .",
    "this poses a bigger challenge for gi to explain these giant planets .",
    "these results apply to the formation of fragments for infall in a smooth , non - structured pattern , which probably applies best to the formation of objects of much lower mass than that of the central star . binary fragmentation can be enhanced by non - axisymmetric infall ( burkert & bodenheimer 1993 ; kratter et al .",
    "2010a ) , which are likely to dominate the formation of companion stars from turbulent initial conditions .",
    "gi - induced fragmentation has been proposed as a mechanism to explain outbursting protostellar accretion phenomena , as in fu orionis and exor objects ( vorobyov & basu 2005 ) .",
    "however , early calculations ( vorobyov & basu 2005 , 2006 ) used a polytropic equation of state which can artificially enhance fragmentation ( boss 1997 ; pickett et al .  2000",
    "; gammie 2001 ) .",
    "recent simulations ( voroboyov & basu 2010 ) with an improved energy equation suggest that gi - induced fragmentation only occurs in a fast rotating massive disk with a low background temperature ; this is consistent with our results that only infall to large disk radii at high infall rates results in fragmentation .",
    "thus , whether outbursts can be explained by protostellar disks fragmentation sensitively depends on the initial conditions of prestellar cores , which need further observational study .    on the other hand , while vorobyov & basu ( 2005 , 2006 ) argued that accretion of fragments explain fu orionis outbursts of accretion from disks , we showed ( zhu et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; see also armitage et al .  2001 ,",
    "rice et al .",
    "2010 , martin & lubow 2011 ) that the gi could trigger bursts of accretion without clumping by thermally triggering the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in the innermost disk .",
    "we further analyzed fu ori s sed to show that the inner @xmath252  au region of fu ori during outburst is a steady accretion disk and it fits the predictions of this picture of mri triggering ( zhu et al .  2007 , 2009 ) . and",
    "recently , this @xmath720.5 au disk has been confirmed by keck interferometric observations ( eisner & hillenbrand , 2011 ) .",
    "this means that transport in the innermost disk is almost certainly dominated by magnetic turbulence rather than gravitational instability , and the symmetry of the rotationally - broadened line profiles ( e.g. , zhu et al .",
    "2009 ) yields no evidence for the strong departure from axisymmetry that would be expected for pure clump accretion .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that we find that some clumps can shear out ( be tidally destroyed ) as they migrate to the innermost disk regions if they do nt open gaps and slow down their migration .",
    "thus , simply finding fragmentation and inward migration is no guarantee that a clump will actually accrete onto the central star as an entity ; it is necessary to follow the evolution of the mass inside of 1 au , which no simulations have done successfully yet , and consider the potential if not probable effects of magnetic turbulence in addition to gi .",
    "it may be , however , that the tidal destruction of the clumps produced by gi - induced fragmentation ( boley et al .",
    "2010 ) or the episodic nature of the gi accretion ( boley & durisen 2008 ) can serve as a mechanism to transport mass to au scales ( compared with the steady accretion by gi as suggested by armitage et al .",
    "2001 and zhu et al .",
    "2009 ) to trigger the mri .",
    "we have presented two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of self - gravitating protostellar disks subject to axisymmetric , steady mass loading from an infalling envelope and irradiation from the central star to explore the growth of gravitational instability ( gi ) , fragmentation , and the fragmented clump evolution .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * we confirm previous analytic estimates that at high infall rates , there is a critical disk radius for infall @xmath72 50 au , beyond which disk fragmentation occurs .",
    "this critical radius decreases with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "* at low infall rates , irradiation suppresses fragmentation and pushes the critical radius to larger values . for a solar - mass protostar ,",

    "rotational support becomes increasingly important as the clump collapses and accretes high angular momentum material from the disk .",
    "* the clumps accrete from the disk at a rate @xmath254 , which can be understood by assuming the accretion cross section corresponds to 1 - 2 hill radii . in our irradiated disks",
    ", this is 10@xmath255 to 10@xmath256 , suggesting the clump can accrete to sub - solar mass on the timescale of thousands of years . *",
    "the clumps migrate inward on the typical type i time scale ( @xmath257  yr in our models ) initially , but with a stochastic component superposed because of interaction with the background spiral waves .",
    "however , the clump slows down when its mass is comparable to the local disk mass , due to its inertia .",
    "a simple fit is given that agrees well with the simulation results .",
    "* when a clump migrates inward its hill radius decreases .",
    "accretion by the clump , however , counteracts the effect of the migration and slows the shrinking of the hill radius .",
    "* there are at least two distinct fates of the clumps , depending on the migration speed .",
    "if the clump migrates slowly with enough time to cool , shrink and accrete , it can become massive enough to open a gap ( @xmath258m@xmath5 in our models ) .",
    "this slows down its migration ( transition to type ii migration ) and may lead to the formation of a binary companion ( 3 out of 13 clumps in our simulation ) . on the other hand , if the clump migrates inward quickly , and is not massive enough to open a gap , it is subject to tidal destruction ( 4 out of 13 clumps ) . in the long run , however , the massive , gap opening clump should be the final fate for these disks , since new clumps can continue forming and be quickly tidally destroyed until eventually a massive clump forms , opens a gap and remains in the disc for a long period of time . *",
    "a simple analytic clump evolution model with clump accretion , migration , and cooling included is presented and it confirms that the different clump fates depend on the migration and accretion rates . *",
    "both rapid clump migration and rapid gas accretion ( leading to clumps much more massive than giant planets ) pose challenges to the scenario that giant planets are formed in situ by gi . and",
    "it is even more challenging to explain currently found giant planets beyond 50 au around a type stars , since , under stronger irradiation , the fragmented clumps will be more massive than those produced in our simulations .",

    "these clumps can be easily detected and resolved by alma , although these first cores may only exist for thousands of years before they collapse to form the second core .",

    "<S> we present two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of self - gravitating protostellar disks subject to axisymmetric , continuing mass loading from an infalling envelope and irradiation from the central star , to explore the growth of gravitational instability ( gi ) and disk fragmentation . </S>",

    "<S> the eventual fates of these clumps , however , diverges depending on the migration speed : 3 out of 13 clumps in our simulations become massive enough ( brown dwarf mass range ) to open gaps in the disk and essentially stop migrating ; 4 out of 13 are tidally destroyed during inward migration ; 6 out of 13 migrate across the inner boundary of the simulated disks . </S>",
