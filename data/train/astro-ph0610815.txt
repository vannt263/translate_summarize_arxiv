    "one of the major challenges of modern astrophysics is to understand the physical processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "significant steps in this direction could be made by tracing the build up of stellar mass and metallicity as a function of cosmic time .",
    "one way to address this issue is through cosmologically deep surveys which map how galaxy properties change for samples at different redshifts ( @xmath3 ) . among these properties ,",
    "the relation first observed by lequeux ( 1979 ) between heavy - element nebular abundance and galaxy mass , or its extension , the luminosity - metallicity relation ( e.g. , skillman 1989 ; zaritsky 1994 ) , are being extensively used to probe the metal enrichment along cosmic history .",
    "clear signs of evolution are being revealed by studies of these relations at both intermediate ( savaglio 2005 ; lamareille 2006 ; mouhcine 2006 ) and high @xmath3 ( shapley 2005 ; maier 2006 ; erb 2006 ) , which generally find significant offsets in these relations when compared to their versions in the local universe .",
    "alternatively , one may study galaxy evolution through _ fossil _ methods , which reconstruct the star formation history ( sfh ) of a galaxy from the properties of their stars .",
    "the most detailed studies of this sort are those based on nearby galaxies ( including our own ) , where color - magnitude diagrams and even spectroscopy of individual stars are feasible ( e.g. , smecker - hane 1996 ; hernandez 2000 ; dolphin 2002 ; rizzi 2003 ; skillman 2003 ; monaco 2005 ; koch 2005 ) . comparing such observations with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models then allows one to infer how stars were born as a function of time , as well as to constrain the chemical enrichment histories of the galaxies ( e.g. , lanfranchi , matteucci & cescutti 2006 ; carigi , coln & peimbert 2006 ) . by mapping how stars become richer in metals as a galaxy ages ,",
    "these studies provide useful constraints for chemical evolution models .    beyond the local group and its neighborhood",
    ", fossil methods must derive sfhs from integrated galaxy spectra , using either selected spectral features ( kauffmann 2004 ; brinchmann 2004 ; gallazzi 2005 ; nelan 2005 ; thomas 2005 ; bernardi 2006 ) or the full spectrum ( panter , heavens & jimenez 2003 ; heavens 2004 ; cid fernandes 2005 ; mathis , charlot & brinchmann 2006 ; panter 2006 ) .",
    "this approach works with much less information than is available from individual stars in galaxies , so one can not expect similar levels of accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , integrated spectra of galaxies are now available by the hundreds of thousands from modern spectroscopic surveys , so the decrease in accuracy is compensated by orders of magnitude increase in statistics and by the broader range in galaxy types spanned by such surveys .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to explore methods to retrieve information on galaxy evolution from integrated spectroscopic data .    in our ongoing series of papers",
    "entitled the semi empirical analysis of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies , ( cid fernandes 2005 ; mateus 2006a ; stasiska 2006 ; mateus 2006b ; seagal i  iv , respectively ) we have shown that a decomposition of galaxy spectra in terms of instantaneous bursts of different ages ( @xmath4 ) and metallicities ( @xmath5 ) produces both excellent spectral fits and astrophysically meaningful results .",
    "so far , however , our description of sfhs has been extremely sketchy , based on averages over the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions , thus washing out valuable time - dependent information .",
    "this paper shows that we can actually do much better . to illustrate this",
    "we have culled a sample of star - forming ( sf ) galaxies from the sdss ( section [ sec : data ] ) , to which we apply our synthesis method and derive mass - assembly and chemical enrichment histories ( section [ sec : sfh_theory ] ) .",
    "the evolution of stellar mass and metallicity is then studied by grouping galaxies with similar nebular abundances or mass ( section [ sec : sfh_results ] ) .",
    "details of this analysis and cross - checks on the results reported here are presented in a companion paper ( asari , in prep , hereafter a07 ) .",
    "we have recently completed detailed pixel - by - pixel spectral fits of 573141 galaxies from the main galaxy sample of the sdss data release 5 ( adelman - mccarthy 2006 ) with the synthesis code starlight described in seagal i and ii .",
    "starlight decomposes an observed spectrum in terms of a sum of simple stellar populations covering a grid of 25 ages from @xmath6 myr to 18 gyr and 6 metallicities @xmath7 to 0.05 ( ie , from 0.005 to 2.5 @xmath8 ) .",
    "each of these @xmath9 instantaneous bursts is represented by a spectrum extracted from the evolutionary synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) for a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function , padova 1994 tracks , and stelib library ( le borgne 2003 ) .",
    "illustrative fits are presented in seagal i and a07 .    emission lines were measured from the starlight subtracted spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : bpt]a shows the baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 , bpt ) diagnostic diagram for 175234 galaxies for which h@xmath10 , [ oiii]@xmath115007 , h@xmath12 and [ nii]@xmath116584 are all detected with @xmath13 .",
    "reddening corrected line fluxes are used in this plot and throughout our analysis .",
    "the distribution of points in this diagram resembles a flying seagull , with sf galaxies occupying the left wing and galaxies hosting an agn on the right .",
    "we define sf galaxies as those under the divisory line proposed in seagal iii ( solid line in figure [ fig : bpt]a ) . further requiring a minimum continuum @xmath14 of 10 at @xmath15",
    "  leaves a set of 84828 objects , hereafter the sf - sample , shown in figure [ fig : bpt]b",
    ". results for alternative sample definitions ( involving different @xmath14 thresholds , other agn / sf separation criteria , and cuts on galaxy inclination ) are presented in a07 .",
    "note that by selecting sf galaxies we indirectly select spirals over elliptical galaxies .",
    "the sf - wing is essentially a sequence in nebular metallicity ( seagal iii and references therein ) , which we quantify by the oxygen abundance obtained through the strong - line calibration of stasiska ( 2006 ) :    @xmath16}\\lambda5007}{{\\rm [ nii]}\\lambda6584}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 ( allende prieto , lambert & asplund 2001 ) .",
    "we believe this is the most reliable calibration available in the literature , since it is based on temperature - based abundances in the metal - poor case and on the ( [ oii ] + [ oiii])/h@xmath10 calibration of pilyugin ( 2000 ) in the metal - rich regime , using a large sample of giant hii regions .",
    "@xmath18 is both a physically motivated and mathematically convenient coordinate to map galaxy positions along the left wing in the bpt diagram . from the tip of the sf - wing in fig [ fig : bpt]a to its bottom",
    ", our sf sample spans the @xmath191.6 @xmath8 range . in fig",
    "[ fig : bpt]b this interval is chopped onto 6 logarithmic bins of width @xmath20 dex , except for the first one which is twice as wide to include more sources .",
    "galaxies inside these same bins will be grouped together in the analysis of star - formation and chemical enrichment histories presented in the following .",
    "as thoroughly discussed in the literature on stellar population synthesis , the combination of noise in the data , astrophysical and mathematical degeneracies limits the amount of information about galactic histories that can be extracted from integrated spectra .",
    "clearly , the 150 components of the population vector used in our fits are a greatly over - detailed description , so some _ a posteriori _ compression of the results to a lower dimension is needed .",
    "our previous papers ( seagal i  iv ) have taken this compression approach to its extreme by reducing the whole @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions encoded in the population vector to their first moments ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the fraction of the total stellar mass ( @xmath24 ) which is in the @xmath25 population .",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath27 proved to be mathematically robust and astrophysically valuable summaries of the full population vector .",
    "in seagal i , ii and a07 these averages are shown to cleanly reveal important relations , such as those between @xmath26 and @xmath24 ( associated with the galaxy downsizing phenomenon ) , @xmath27 and @xmath24 ( the mass - metallicity relation ) , and @xmath28 and @xmath18 ( which reveals a connection between stellar and nebular chemical enrichment levels ) . given this success , it is natural to explore less drastic compressions of the population vector .",
    "one way to compress the population vector but retain the age - information is to marginalize over the @xmath29 distribution and compute the total mass converted into stars as a function of time :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 denotes the fraction of the total mass converted onto stars ( @xmath32 ) that is associated with the @xmath25 base age .",
    "the superscript `` c '' stands for `` converted onto stars '' , and is introduced to distinguish @xmath31 and @xmath33 from @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which refer to the mass still locked inside stars , ie , discounting the mass returned to the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) by stellar evolution .",
    "@xmath34 is thus a monotonic function which grows from 0 to 1 as @xmath4 runs from the time galaxy formation starts to the present , and maps what fraction of @xmath32 was assembled up to a given lookback time .",
    ", such that @xmath4 is both a stellar - age and a lookback time . ]    to track the evolution of the _ stellar metallicity _ we compute the total mass in metals inside stars as a function of @xmath4 and divide it by the total mass inside stars at the same time .",
    "this yields the time - dependent mean stellar metallicity :    @xmath35    the computation of @xmath36 takes into account that the total mass inside stars changes with time , both due to the sfh and to the time dependence of the returned mass .",
    "accordingly , only populations older than @xmath4 enter the definition of @xmath36 , since younger ones had not formed yet , ie .",
    ", @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "the explicit time - dependence in equations ( [ eq : mah ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta ] ) provides a description of the star formation and chemical histories of galaxies which goes well beyond that obtained with the mere first moments of the age and metallicity distributions .",
    "given the numerous degeneracies which affect population synthesis of galaxy spectra one might be skeptical as to how useful they actually are .",
    "simulations addressing this issue will be presented elsewhere . in what follows we report what is obtained in practice .",
    "our strategy is to chop the sf - wing into bins in @xmath18 and study the evolution of galaxies from the statistics of @xmath34 and @xmath39 in each bin .",
    "the fact that @xmath18 correlates strongly with several physical and observational properties guarantees that galaxies inside each @xmath18 bin are intrinsically similar , which in turn implies that statistics over such bins is meaningful .",
    "fig [ fig : mean_chemevol]a shows the mean mass - assembly functions obtained for each of the six @xmath18 bins illustrated in fig [ fig : bpt]b .",
    "the systematics is evident to the eye .",
    "galaxies with low @xmath18 are slower in assembling their stars than those with high @xmath18 .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that , although most of the mass is assembled at early times ( @xmath40 gyr ) , galaxies at the tip of the sf - wing have larger star formation rates ( sfr ) per unit mass in the recent past than those at the bottom of the wing .",
    "this trend can be quantified in terms the ratio of the mean sfr in the last 60 myr to that over the galaxy s history , ie , the so called scalo s @xmath41 parameter ( eg , brinchmann 2004 ) .",
    "we find @xmath41 to decrease by a factor of @xmath42 from the lower to the higher @xmath18 bins .",
    "( sfrs are discussed in a07 , where it is also shown that our synthesis based sfrs agree very well with those derived from the h@xmath12 luminosity . )",
    "alternatively , one may quantify this behavior by computing the time at which the mean @xmath34 function reaches 0.75 , ie .",
    ", the time at which the mass involved in star - formation reaches 3/4 of the total .",
    "we find that @xmath43 increases from @xmath44 gyr at @xmath45 ( bin a in fig [ fig : bpt]b ) , to 2 gyr at @xmath46 ( bin d ) , and 8 gyr for the highest @xmath18 bin . given that @xmath18 correlates strongly with @xmath24 ( zaritsky 2004 ; tremonti 2004 ; lee 2006 ) , this behavior is ultimately a signature of galaxy downsizing ( cowie 1996 ) .    ) and ( b ) chemical evolution ( @xmath47 ) of stars in sf galaxies for the same six @xmath18-bins defined in fig [ fig : bpt]b .",
    "each line represents a @xmath4-by-@xmath4 average over all galaxies in the bin .",
    "a mild gaussian smoothing with fwhm = 0.2 dex in @xmath48 was applied to the mean @xmath34 and @xmath39 curves , just enough to smooth out discreteness effects associated to the 25 ages in the base.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the chemical evolution of stars in sf galaxies is shown in fig [ fig : mean_chemevol]b . again , the main message is clear : galaxies with a metal poor ism are low are slow in their stellar chemical enrichment . in the lower @xmath18 bins , @xmath39 only reaches the current stellar metallicity level ( @xmath49 ) as recently as @xmath50 myr .",
    "galaxies with larger @xmath18 , on the other hand , have flatter and systematically higher @xmath39 curves .",
    "these massive systems have essentially completed their mass assembly and chemical evolution long ago , so that recent star - forming activity has a negligible impact upon @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that bins of increasing @xmath18 have increasingly higher present @xmath47 values confirms that nebular and stellar metallicities are related ( seagal i ; gallazzi 2005 ; a07 ) .",
    "we nevertheless warn the reader not to overinterpret the quantitative relation between these two quantities , given that they are derived by completely different and hardly comparable means . in this paper",
    "we use [ oiii]/[nii ] as an indicator of @xmath18 ( equation [ eq : z_neb ] ) , because of its evident relation to the position of the points in the bpt diagram .",
    "however , as emphasized by stasiska ( 2006 ) , strong line methods for deriving nebular abundances have been calibrated using giant hii regions and their relevance for integrated spectra of galaxies has still to be examined , because of the role of metallicity gradients and of the diffuse ionized medium in galaxies .",
    "in addition , there is so far no study comparing nebular abundance calibrations with stellar abundances .",
    "therefore , our @xmath18 values are not necessarily on the same scale as stellar abundances .",
    "insofar as this paper is concerned , this is not a problem , since , irrespective of absolute values , it is the existence of a @xmath18-@xmath47 relation which is responsible for the ordering of the different chemical evolution curves in fig [ fig : mean_chemevol]b .    , but binning sf galaxies by their stellar mass , using five 1 dex wide bins , centered at ( from bottom to top ) @xmath51 , 8.5 , 9.5 , 10.5 and 11.5 , which contain 583 , 4750 , 29056 , 46847 and 3550 galaxies , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      while fig [ fig : mean_chemevol ] illustrates the strong link between the stellar mass assembly and chemical evolution histories of galaxies and the present ionized ism metal content , @xmath18 is not the cause , but the product of galaxy evolution , so its use as an independent variable , although pedagogically useful , is questionable . if one had to chose a single quantity as the main driver of galaxy evolution this would surely be its mass ( eg . , tinsley 1968 ; larson 1974 ; pagel 1997 ) .",
    "we have thus repeated the analysis above binning galaxies by @xmath24 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "results are shown in fig [ fig : mean_chemevol_binnedbymass ] for five 1 dex - wide mass bins centered at @xmath52 . because of the flattening of the @xmath53 relation at high masses and the substantial scatter around the relation , particularly at low @xmath24 and @xmath18 , binning in @xmath24 or @xmath18 samples somewhat different populations of galaxies .",
    "on the whole , however , this alternative grouping scheme leads to the same general scenario outlined above , with low @xmath24 galaxies being slower in their mass and chemical build up than more massive ones .",
    "a caveat is that @xmath24 is not a perfect tracer of the depth of the potential well , since it does not account for the mass in gas nor dark matter . in any case , the signature of galaxy downsizing is evident in fig [ fig : mean_chemevol_binnedbymass ] : massive galaxies today formed most of their stars and metals long time ago , whereas low - mass galaxies are still forming stars and metals actively .",
    "the signal of chemical evolution is present in all curves in figs [ fig : mean_chemevol]b and [ fig : mean_chemevol_binnedbymass]b .",
    "curiously , however , this evolution does not seem to start from very low @xmath47 for massive , high @xmath18 galaxies ( eg , bins e and f ) .",
    "we interpret this apparent lack of old , metal poor populations as due to a combination of lack of age resolution at high @xmath4 and an intrinsically fast evolution ocurring at early times . in low mass systems",
    "( eg , bin a ) , @xmath39 starts is @xmath54 gyr long rise period at @xmath553 gyr , such that @xmath56 is of order unity .",
    "the same process happening at @xmath57 gyr would yield @xmath58 , and consequently be much harder to resolve .",
    "as shown above above , by @xmath59 gyr massive galaxies had already assembled most of their mass , so their chemical evolution must also have occurred early on .",
    "this mixture of populations of widely different metallicities but similar ages results in @xmath47 values at @xmath57 gyr which are dominated by the metal rich stars already present at those times .",
    "such an early and rapid formation period should lead to enhancement of elements synthesized in type ii sne ( worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; thomas 2005 ) . though we can not map elemental abundances with our method",
    ", we do detect a signal of increasing @xmath12 enhancement towards the bottom of the bpt diagram by means of systematically increasing residuals in spectral bands due to @xmath12 elements like mg ( a07 ) , indirectly supporting the scenario outlined above .",
    "our analysis shows that the present ism abundance is intimately connected to the past star - formation and chemical enrichment history of a galaxy . whereas this is intuitively obvious from a physical point of view , it is not obvious at all that one should be able to recover this behavior from population synthesis analysis of integrated galaxy spectra of sdss - like quality .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike previous studies such as that by bica ( 1988 ) , our fits impose no _ a priori _ chemical evolution constraints whatsoever upon the mixture of @xmath60 s and @xmath29 s in the base .",
    "given the absence of constraints and the fact that the fits are completely independent of the emission line data used to compute @xmath18 , the organization of galaxies with different @xmath18 onto the clear and systematically distinct stellar chemical enrichment patterns seen in fig [ fig : mean_chemevol]b is remarkable , revealing that fossil methods based on integrated spectra have reached a level of maturity which would be unthinkable just a few years ago ( eg , cid fernandes 2001 ) . by taking the spectral synthesis output one step further than the trivial first moments of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions , we have been able to uncover the chemical evolution of galaxies with an unprecedented level of detail for such a large and varied sample .",
    "this significant achievement was only possible due to the fabulous statistics of the sdss , combined with state - of - the - art evolutionary synthesis models and reliable sfh recovery techniques .",
    "the sheer number of galaxies allows us to recover an unequivocal chemical evolution signal which would be at best doubtful for individual galaxies or even small samples .",
    "combined with our estimates of the star - formation histories , the empirically derived chemical evolution patterns should provide valuable constraints for galaxy evolution models .",
    "we thank support from the brazilian agencies cnpq and fapesp .",
