    "the first observation of @xmath0 meson at fnal @xcite motivates new theoretical study in the field of heavy quarkonium physics .",
    "the unique properties of @xmath0 meson , containing heavy quarks of different flavours , may be studied , first of all , via decay modes with @xmath2 meson in the final state .",
    "we consider here two - particle hadronic decays of @xmath0 meson into s - wave    and p - wave charmonium states @xmath4 where @xmath5 or @xmath2 for s - wave states , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 for p - wave states .",
    "these decays are of considerable interest as a clean signal of @xmath0 meson production in high energy collisions @xcite .    because of the large momentum transfer to the spectator quark ( @xmath10 ) in the decays ( 1.1 )",
    ", the hard scattering formalism is more appropriate than the spectator model , which based on the transition form - factor calculation under the overlapping of the quarkonium wave functions .",
    "in contrast to the spectator model , the hard scattering formalism results in the approximate double enhancement of the decay amplitude for the decays @xmath11 , as it was found in @xcite .",
    "in the model under consideration it is assumed that heavy quarkonium ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) is a non - relativistic quark - antiquark system with small binding energy .",
    "such a way , the @xmath0 meson decay amplitude is factorized in a hard part which describes the process @xmath12 and an amplitude describing the binding of the initial and the final heavy quark pairs into @xmath0 meson and @xmath1 state .",
    "the general covariant formalism for calculating the production and decay rates of s - wave and p - wave heavy quarkonium in the non - relativistic expansion was developed some times ago @xcite . in the leading non - relativistic approximation ,",
    "the mass of @xmath0 meson @xmath13 is simply the sum of b - quark and c - quark masses @xmath14 , and the mass of @xmath1 is equal @xmath15 .",
    "the amplitude for decay the bound - state ( @xmath16 ) in a state with momentum @xmath17 , total angular momentum @xmath18 , total orbital momentum @xmath19 and total spin @xmath20 into bound - state ( @xmath21 ) in a state with momentum @xmath22 , total angular momentum @xmath23 , total orbital momentum @xmath24 and total spin @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hard amplitude which is described by the diagrams in fig .",
    "1,2 .    to introduce the operators @xmath28 which projects the quark - antiquark pairs onto the bound states with fixed quantum number up to second order in @xmath29 and @xmath30 :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ;    @xmath36    where @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are spin - one polarization four - vectors .",
    "using projection operators ( 2.2 ) and ( 2.3 ) the hard amplitude @xmath27 may be presented as follows : @xmath42,\\ ] ] where for decay with @xmath43 meson in final state @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 the factor @xmath47 comes from hard gluon corrections to the four - fermion effective vertex .",
    "since @xmath48 and @xmath49 are small quantities , we can expand @xmath27 around @xmath50 in a taylor expansion : @xmath51 here the each term correspond to quantum numbers @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and so forth .",
    "thus for the s - wave ( @xmath57 ) and p - wave ( @xmath58 ) states , the amplitude @xmath59 will depend on the quarkonium radial wave - functions through the following relations : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the polarization vector for the spin - one particle .",
    "in the case of production charmonium state @xmath62 one has @xmath63 the summation over polarization may be done using following expression @xmath64 where @xmath65 in the case of production @xmath66 states one has @xmath67 the polarization sums for @xmath68 is given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath69",
    "omitting the details of calculations we presented below the results for decay widths of ground - state @xmath70 system into different states of charmonium plus @xmath43 or @xmath71 meson . in the limit of vanishing @xmath43 meson mass",
    "we obtained the simple analytical formulae : @xmath72 where @xmath73 to perform the numerical calculations we use following set of parameters : @xmath74 gev@xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 gev , @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev , @xmath87 gev@xmath88 , @xmath89 gev@xmath88 , @xmath90 gev@xmath91 .    with above",
    "mentioned set of parameters one gets the following result @xmath92 the decay widths into different charmonium states plus @xmath43 meson may be presented through decay width for @xmath93 as it is shown in table 1 .",
    "the another source of @xmath2 mesons is two - particle decay of @xmath0 meson with @xmath71 meson in the final state : @xmath94 .",
    "the calculating for the decay widths @xmath95 may be done the same way as for widths @xmath96 using substitution @xmath97 in ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , where @xmath98 is @xmath71 meson polarization four - vector . taking into account that @xmath99 gev and @xmath100 gev , we have obtained the decay widths @xmath95 which are presented in the table 1 too as the ratio @xmath101 .",
    "we found surprisingly large value for the decay width of @xmath0 meson into p - wave charmonia , which is 50 % of the decay width into s - wave states .",
    "because of @xmath2 meson production in the decays of @xmath0 meson is very suitable process from viewpoint of an experimental study @xcite ,    it is interesting to compare the direct @xmath2 production ( @xmath102 ) and the cascade @xmath2 production rates .",
    "the second one comes from radiative decays of the p - wave states @xmath103 and @xmath9 , which have following branching ratios into @xmath2 plus @xmath104 : @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "thus we have obtained @xmath108 and @xmath109 the ratio for the sum of the @xmath0 meson decay widths into @xmath2 meson plus @xmath43 or @xmath71 meson is equal to @xmath110    in compare with the previous estimations @xcite we should expect the enhancement by 8 % the branching ratio for the @xmath0 decays into @xmath2 in the two - particle hadronic decays via the cascade processes .",
    "this fact makes the probability of @xmath0 meson observation through the decays @xmath3      the author thanks v.v .",
