    "an ability to control systems down to the limits imposed by quantum mechanics is expected by many to usher a new era in technology , the so - called ` second quantum revolution '  @xcite .",
    "although often one is interested in harnessing effects not possible , or not practical to achieve with classical physics , quantum processes can also be used to enhance classical processes , and often provide limiting cases in terms of fidelity or power for classical effects .",
    "one of the most important and well - studied fields showing quantum control is nonlinear optics .",
    "coherently prepared atoms or atomic systems , often under conditions of electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) , can be shown to exhibit large , lossless nonlinearities  @xcite that can be useful for quantum logic  @xcite . here",
    "we turn our attention to a nonlinearity that is less explored in the quantum space , namely absorptive nonlinearity .",
    "saturable absorption is a well - known nonlinear process .",
    "an optical field impinges on a medium , usually treated as an ensemble of two - state systems  @xcite . for low intensities ,",
    "the field is greatly attenuated , but at high fields , as the medium is saturated , the absorption is relatively low .",
    "this effect is useful for many practical tasks , including analog - to - digital conversion  @xcite , passive mode - locking of laser radiation  @xcite and sub - diffraction imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyse eit - based absorptive nonlinearities in detail .",
    "usually eit is used as a means of generating a medium with zero absorption and high dispersion , which can be the enabler of large lossless optical nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "eit employs two coherent fields ( e.g. , signal and pump ) driving a raman transition between two , long - lived ground states via a shared excited state , in the @xmath0 configuration , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a ) .",
    "when the ground - state decoherence is absent , quantum interference is complete and a long - lived dark state is observed , which manifests ideally as a perfect transparency window at the two - photon resonance point .",
    "the associated steep dispersion has recently been shown to allow sub - nanometer - scale resolution for microscopy , surpassing the the two - level system based technique  @xcite .",
    "ground - state dephasing plays a critical role in practical eit schemes . in general , the coherence responsible for eit must compete with decoherence , and this ultimately limits the depth and width of the transparency window .",
    "however , this competition allows for saturable absorption .",
    "_ have shown that the absorptive nonlinearity can occur even when the radiation intensity is much less than that needed for saturation of the transition  @xcite .",
    "the effect is termed coherent bleaching .    here",
    "we investigate this bleaching effect under conditions that are less restrictive than those considered previously in refs .",
    "in particular we show that the three - state system provides increased flexibility over the onset of the nonlinearity with the signal absorption tunable with the pump field post fabrication , typically absent in two - state schemes .",
    "this is distinct from saturation and coherent bleaching because photon - assisted nonlinearity occurs even when both the coherent and saturation nonlinearities are weak .",
    "moreoever the absorption scaling with intensity can be quadratic under certain conditions , and thus can provide a greater sensitivity for applications such as noise filtration and analog - to - digital conversion applications . given that our focus is on this enhanced absorption properties , this work is also distinct from the effect of tunable electromagnetically - induced absorption in doubly dressed two - level systems  @xcite .",

    "we note that for @xmath99 the coefficient changes @xmath100 ( for some constant @xmath101 ) to the quadratic scaling , depicted by the lower end of the dashed curve in fig .",

    "our analyses and observations are valid for a signal field with a small spectral width compared to the size of the eit features at @xmath43 , because we have only used the zeroth - order term of @xmath54 .",
    "this bandwidth requirement fundamentally limits the operational speed of the three - state scheme .",
    "for instance , the fwhm of the two - state @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 and the response time of the system @xmath106 commensurates with @xmath107 , which is necessarily faster than the excited - state lifetime . for the eit - based scheme ,",

    ", we retrieve a single - peak absorption curve that simplifies to @xmath112 with fwhm of @xmath113 .    our results and discussion",
    "so far provide the foundation of the proposed scheme for optically - thin absorber . however , to determine the overall response of an extended medium , we need to consider the evolution of the propagating fields .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "in an optically - thick system , the intensity of the transmitted fields must be treated as a function of position within the absorbing medium . under the cw illumination or when the pulse has a broad and smooth distribution , the beer - lambert law can be used to determine the propagation of the pulse , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the depth in the medium .",
    "this can also be regarded as a short - memory markov - like condition on the time evolution .",
    "there are at least two possible implementations , as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : schematics](b ) and ( c ) , namely _ uniform - pump _ and _ copropagating - pump _ arrangements , respectively .",

    "the first four curves show the tunability of the medium with the pump field . ]      in the uniform - pump arrangement , the pump field strength is uniform across the entire medium and only the signal field sees an optically - thick medium .",
    "the implementation therefore may involve directing the pump field at some angle to the propagation axis of the signal field , and thus this is most suitable in solid - state or cold atomic vapour environment where doppler broadening is negligible . since @xmath95 is a constant ,",
    "we only need to integrate the propagation differential equation ( eq .  [ eq : bllaw ] ) for the signal field using eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha3int ] to arrive at the general law of intensity transfer for the three - state scheme , @xmath121   + \\frac{i_0 ^ 2 - i(z)^2 } { i_p i_{\\rm coh } } \\nonumber \\\\      & + & [ i_0-i(z)]\\big ( \\frac{1}{i_p } + \\frac{1}{i_{\\rm sat } } + \\frac{2}{i_{\\rm coh } } \\big )      \\label{eq : transferlaw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to solve for the characteristic penetration depth , we consider the different regimes separately .",
    "for the first forementioned case where bleaching occurs @xmath122 , the penetration depth of the input field has extended from @xmath123 to @xmath124 at nonlinearity , comparable with the usual case of coherent bleaching ( where @xmath125 ) and saturation ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "on the other hand in the second case , this length is given by @xmath127 .    if @xmath128 , the absorptive nonlinearity is not manifested and the field decays exponentially in accordance with @xmath129 .",
    "however if @xmath130 , a linear decay occurs as @xmath131 until the field intensity reaches @xmath132 that the decay becomes exponential .",
    "finally when the condition in eq .",
    "[ eq : quadcond ] is true , we find the slowest decay as @xmath133 that attenuates the signal field enough to become a linear decay , followed by an exponential drop off .",

    "observe that the turn on of the transmittance varies with pump field intensity and can occur with a sharper gradient than the two - state medium . ]    to plot the transmittance of the medium of length @xmath135 , we rewrite eq .",

    "the proposed scheme for tunable absorption nonlinearity can be implemented in a variety of solid - state and vapour phase media .",
    "we concentrate our attention on diamond defects for the solid - state and rubidium ( rb ) vapour for the gas phase , but we note in passing that quantum dots  @xcite , and rare - earth crystals  @xcite provide equally promising solid - state implementations .    in the solid state ,",
    "we envisage one practical realization using a doped diamond waveguide implemented as a step - index fibre  @xcite , a line defect in the photonic - bandgap structure  @xcite [ fig .",

    "diamond hosts numerous optically - active impurity- and/or vacancy - based defects , and a prominent centre featured in numerous quantum - optical device designs is the negatively - charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre  @xcite .",

    ", the nv can be treated as a @xmath0-type system where we identify the required energy levels with the available spin states , @xmath192 being the excited spin triplet state whereas states @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( or @xmath195 ) zeeman sublevels of the triplet ground state @xmath196  @xcite .",
    "the dipole moment between transitions @xmath1 and @xmath11 is @xmath197  cm  @xcite . to avoid optical cross coupling between the nvs ,",

    "the nv has a radiative lifetime of 11.6  ns or @xmath205  mhz and a dephasing lifetime up to @xmath206s  @xcite , so that the small - signal attenuation coefficient is @xmath207  m@xmath167 and saturation and coherence intensities are of order 1  mw / m@xmath200 . for @xmath140 in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmittuni ] , the required length @xmath135 of medium to demonstrate the tunable absorption properties for the uniform - pump setup is 2  cm .",

    "[ fig : transmittco ] , we estimate @xmath208  cm ( for @xmath134 ) and an interaction length of 29  cm ( for 10 ) for the same value of absorption coefficient .",
    "this can be achieved by folding the waveguide back onto itself for multiple times in a standard diamond wafer .",
    "the dephasing time is related to the concentration of electron paramagnetic impurities in the diamond lattice  @xcite and hence @xmath49 can be in part controlled at fabrication .",
    "the @xmath0-type configuration also appears naturally in the hyperfine structures of the atomic @xmath209rb vapour . using the @xmath210 transition , the pump and signal fields of wavelength @xmath211  nm couple pairs of zeeman sublevels of the atomic @xmath212 , @xmath213 state via the common upper state @xmath214 , @xmath215  @xcite .",

    "we expect a short cell of length of @xmath225  @xmath226 m should be sufficient for operations with @xmath134 and 0.1 , respectively , owing to a relatively large coefficient @xmath227  m@xmath167 .",
    "we have analysed nonlinear absorption in an ensemble of three - level atoms in a signal - pump eit configuration . in the presence of ground - state dephasing ,",
    "eit is not complete at two - photon resonance and bleaching occurs .",
    "while this is comparable with conventional saturable absorption in an ensemble of two - level atoms , the effective absorptive nonlinearity associated with the signal field in the eit system can be stronger , and can scale quadratically with signal intensity .",
    "moreover as the eit features depend on the pump beam intensity , the bleaching intensity of the absorber can be modified post - fabrication .",
    "we considered two different signal - pump arrangements with uniform pump and copropagating pump beams , and show that nonlinear change in the transmission property of an optically - thick three - state medium is sharper than the two - state scheme .",
    "this effect may be useful for noise filtration and microscopy , especially in the weak signal regime , and perhaps in the future , for manipulating the quantum , rather than classical , properties of fields .",
