    "in the last few years , evidence has mounted suggesting that the universe is currently accelerating .",
    "measurements of type ia supernovae [ 1 ] indicate that the evolution of the hubble parameter departs from that expected for a matter dominated universe , and behaves as if under the influence of a negative pressure due to a smooth and dominant background ( dark ) energy .",
    "further evidence for a vacuum - dominated universe comes from a combination of observations : large scale structure ( lss ) [ 2 ] suggests a low matter density universe while the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data [ 3 ] shows the density of the universe to be virtually critical , consistent with the requirements of the early inflationary scenario [ 4 ] .",
    "success of inflation required that the universe be in a vacuum - dominated state with a large associated potential energy .",
    "this feature , when taken together with the observations of a currently low density vacuum energy dominating the universe , leads to at least two potential problems that modern cosmology must address .",
    "first , the discrepancy between the initial high potential energy state and the current low background dark energy constitutes what has been called [ 5 ] the cosmological constant problem . a new twist to this problem , and which has been called the _ coincidence problem _",
    ", relates to the observation [ 1 ] that the current background vacuum energy density , @xmath1 @xmath2 is not only not zero , but is also of the same order of magnitude as the current density @xmath3 of the matter fields .",
    "this state of affairs gives rise to yet another complication .",
    "the observed current vacuum - dominated state of the universe is not _ a priori _ predicted by theoretical cosmology , and ( as of now ) its origin remains mysterious .  to this extent",
    ", it is not known whether or not there is a future ( graceful ) exit from the resulting cosmic acceleration ( as was the case in the early universe ) .",
    "the situation reflects our current ignorance with regard to the future dynamical evolution of the universe .",
    "it constitutes a _ _",
    "dynamical problem__.    several approaches have been developed to address the why is @xmath4 small now ?",
    "part of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "they include dynamical @xmath5term models [ 6 , 7 ] , dynamical equation of state models [ 8 ] , and rolling scalar field models [ 9 ] . a common feature in these models is that the vacuum energy takes on a dynamical character , decaying from some initially large value to a small one .",
    "one approach , usually favored by particle physicists , is to seek for mechanisms to cancel or at least suppress @xmath4 , as in coleman s wormhole approach [ 10 ] or by introducing compensating fields in the lagrangian . in his notable works ,",
    "brandenberger has argued ( for a review see [ 11 ] ) that gravitational back - reaction may lead to a dynamical cancellation mechanism for a bare cosmological constant by giving rise to an evolving anti - de sitter - like field .",
    "meanwhile , the observation , [ 1 ] of a small but non - vanishing background dark energy has made the cosmological constant problem even worse , since it is harder to advance a symmetry argument that justifies an _ almost _ non - vanishing cosmological constant . in 1998 ,",
    "caldwell , dave and steinhardt [ 12 ] proposed the existence of a background field with a dynamical equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "they called it _",
    "quintessence_. since then , tracker models based on [ 12 ] have evolved to discuss the possible origin of the observed current cosmic acceleration .",
    "the issue of tying together the disappearance of the early universe s cosmological constant with what the source of the current dark energy might be , and why the density of the latter is currently coincidentally close to that of the matter fields , is a challenge for which cosmology still searches for a physically justifiable solution .",
    "some authors have suggested an anthropic principle [ 13 ] to explain the observations .    in this article a potential framework for addressing both the cosmological constant problem and the _ dynamical problem _ is proposed .",
    "the framework is based on the premise that the background dark energy is both dynamical and interacting .",
    "it is possible that there may be several physical arguments which can be put forward to justify this notion , among which is the following example . according to general relativity a vacuum dominated universe ( spacetime ) has an asymptotically de sitter geometry with an asymptotically de sitter horizon .",
    "quantum considerations indicate ( for a review see e.g. [ 14a , b ] ) * *  * * that near the horizon such a spacetime is associated with time asymmetric quantum states ( analogous to those in the unruh vacuum ) which lead to a radiation flux .",
    "this means that one can treat the horizon ( size @xmath7 as a radiative surface with a horizon temperature @xmath8 and area @xmath9 so that the cosmological constant @xmath10 which is the energy source @xmath11 in a de sitter spacetime also becomes a source of radiation flux , ( i.e. particle creation ) . with this view",
    ", one is led to the conclusion that the vacuum energy associated with @xmath4 must ( 1 ) decay and ( 2 ) create matter in the process .",
    "it is in this respect that such cosmic background vacuum ( dark ) energy is both dynamical and interacting .",
    "the issue of a time dependant `` cosmological constant '' has always been a touchy one in both general relativity and quantum cosmology for seemingly different , but actually , related reasons . in quantum cosmology , which is based on quantum field theory , there is no mechanism to change the ( de sitter ) vacuum states ; while in general relativity , the einstein field equations demand that the energy momentum tensor of the de sitter spacetime can only be proportional to the spacetime metric @xmath12 . on the other hand",
    "the foregoing considerations suggest that just as the eternal black hole ( and its associated hartle - hawking vacuum ) in classical general relativity is an idealization , analogously , a vacuum dominated universe can not stay in an eternally fixed de sitter state . as pointed out in [ 14b ] ,",
    "the temperature and entropy for a collapsing black hole and those of an asymptotically de sitter spacetime arise in identical manner due to identical mathematical formalism",
    ". it would therefore be surprising if one spacetime ( de sitter ) is static while the other one is non - static .",
    "consequently , in our treatment , @xmath13 must decay .",
    "such a feature of an asymptotically de sitter spacetime , is among potential tools one can apply to our universe to understand why `` @xmath4 is small now but not zero '' and also ( as we find soon ) points to a potential resolution of both the _ coincidence problem _ and the _ dynamical problem . _",
    "this paper discusses only the macroscopic effects ( of the above underlying microscopic physics of vacuum matter interactions ) , namely , the global cosmic dynamics .",
    "the approach is reminiscent of what thermodynamics is to statistical mechanics . in this respect",
    "the universe can be treated as a vacuum - driven cosmic engine .",
    "the cosmic vacuum energy acts as the fuel , doing work on the universe by accelerating it .",
    "as is the case with any engine , it is impossible for the universe to convert all its fuel to mechanical work without dissipating some through irreversible processes that increase its internal energy .",
    "this is analogous to a statement of the first law of thermodynamics and is suggestive of a first law of cosmic dynamics . in turn ,",
    "the irreversible dissipations lead to a cosmic form of the second ( or entropy creation ) law , @xmath14 .",
    "looking at the simplicity of these notions , it is tempting to wonder what new feature the approach brings . in this treatment ,",
    "the irreversible dissipation process introduced above is , indeed , cardinal to the dynamics of the universe , and to underscore this we make the following _ cosmic equilibrium conjecture _ ( cec ) :    the universe will increase its inertia ( matter creation ) as a back - reaction to any ( vacuum energy ) influences tending to move it away from ( dynamical ) equilibrium .",
    "facilitating such processes , on a macroscopic scale , is a ( bulk viscous ) creation pressure @xmath15 , which arises as a back - reaction to the spacetime acceleration .",
    "the role of this back - pressure is to build up inertia to oppose the change ( acceleration ) which creates it , in the first place .",
    "it does this by creating matter .",
    "this behavior behavior is reminiscent of equilibrium - seeking systems in nature .",
    "for example , in electromagnetic induction , lenz s law [ 15 ] predicts a back emf ; while in qcd , quark confinement is explained in terms of asymptotic freedom [ 16 ] .",
    "it is interesting that in this latter process the system will actually create matter , when faced with external influences ( forces ) tending to shift it from equilibrium .    in the current treatment , the vacuum - dissipation / matter - creation process couples the vacuum to matter through a parameter @xmath16 , which we constrain . in this scenario ,",
    "( increasing cosmic inertia ) physical modes will be created until the cosmic acceleration is offset and the creation pressure @xmath17 vanishes . as an example , this is how ( in this model ) the universe is able to get out of inflation and become matter dominated . with no further immediate need for creation ,",
    "the existing matter fields in a given comoving volume begin to dilute normally , ( which is relatively faster ) .",
    "such redshifting of the matter fields , eventually , leads to a further vacuum domination which in turn commences a new cycle of cosmic acceleration and the consequent creation . as a result ,",
    "the process sets up oscillations in the decaying vacuum and corresponding sympathetic ones in the matter fields .",
    "these coupled oscillations constrain the fields to track each other naturally . as the universe evolves in time , successive periods of acceleration are dominated by ever decreasing ( decaying ) energy densities .",
    "the resulting back - reactions will similarly be increasingly weaker , producing infra - red - shifting dominated modes .",
    "each such acceleration will be weaker and last longer than its predecessors .",
    "this would explain why the current cosmic acceleration has lasted much longer than the early cosmic inflation .",
    "these ideas are used in this paper to establish bounds on the relative magnitudes of the evolving fields .",
    "it is in this sense that the model offers a natural and conceptually simple channel to discussing the _ coincidence problem _ , while also suggesting a way to deal with the _ dynamical problem_. the approach also independently relates the current vacuum - dominated state of the universe to the early conditions by suggesting inflation as a natural initial condition to the current classical dynamics . at the same time",
    ", it provides a rationale for a natural exit to , not only the inflationary scenario but also , the current acceleration .",
    "lastly , the _ cosmic equilibrium conjecture _ ( cec ) suggests a physically motivated ansatz to what is otherwise a ( time - old ) philosophical question , namely , why does the universe need and create matter ? .",
    "the model has significant observational consequences .",
    "the constructed equation of state @xmath18 for the interacting dark energy suggests a quasi - periodic acceleration which can be directly tested by future experiments such as snap [ 17 ] . in this article",
    ", the emphasis is to study the interactions between dark energy and matter fields and how , in particular , they lead to a resolution of the coincidence problem . to this end , it is sufficient to consider the behavior of the relevant energy - momemtum tensor .",
    "this leads to the evolution of the fields @xmath19 and @xmath20  with the scale factor , @xmath21 on a fixed gravitational background configuration .",
    "a derivation of the time evolution of the scale factor @xmath22 , which requires solving the resulting gravitational field equations for the matter fields in the presence of interacting dark energy , will be made in a forthcoming article .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section 2 the working equations for an interacting vacuum energy",
    "are set up .",
    "section 3 discusses the evolution of the vacuum energy density in the presence of matter creating processes .",
    "section 4 lays out the framework for the evolution of the matter fields in such an environment .",
    "a potential resolution to both the _ coincidence problem _ and the _ dynamical problem _ is presented and observational tests are mentioned .",
    "section 5 concludes the article . throughout the article the terms",
    "_ cosmic _ _ vacuum _ _ energy _ and _ dark  energy _ are _ _  _ _ used interchangeably to describe a background cosmic energy that is both dynamical and interacting__. _ _",
    "in modeling an interacting vacuum , we take as the generator of cosmic vacuum energy @xmath23 , a dynamical cosmological parameter , @xmath24 of the form @xmath25where @xmath26 is the planck mass , @xmath27 ( the fluctuation scale ) is the size scale of a causally connected region of space at the planck time @xmath28and @xmath29 is of order of the planck time .",
    "further , @xmath30 is the hubble parameter and @xmath22 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the model , is that the power index @xmath31 is not a fixed constant in time ( as in most previous cases reviewed in [ 6 ] ) but rather depends on time in a manner to be determined in section 3 .",
    "this feature , which is a consequence of the _ cosmic equilibrium conjecture _ allows the background dark energy to couple to matter .    as is apparent from eq .",
    "2.1 , in this scenario , the @xmath32-field initially @xmath33 appears to tunnel into existence .",
    "thereafter , for @xmath34 the dynamics of the early universe is driven by the growing term @xmath35 and should be dominated by a quantum character .",
    "a rigorous discussion of the physics of the period @xmath36 requires a quantum theory of gravity and is , therefore , still beyond the scope of the present treatment .",
    "it is , however , worth pointing out that for @xmath34 the field in eq .",
    "2.1 is growing in density and so one expects its equation of state during this early period to take the form @xmath37 . as the field evolves towards its stationary point , @xmath38 , the equation of state @xmath6 approaches @xmath39 from below , to temporarily mimic a cosmological constant . in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath40 , or @xmath41 = 0 $ ] , @xmath24  is virtually constant with maximum potential energy ( possibly in the range @xmath42 ) .",
    "these conditions give rise to a cosmic inflation , in the early universe@xmath43 as the hubble time @xmath44 grows , the quantity @xmath45 quickly approaches saturation @xmath46 .",
    "subsequently , the dynamics of the universe becomes increasingly classical , being driven by the @xmath47 part of @xmath32 .",
    "it is this latter phase that this article discusses .    assuming successful inflation in the early era , then by the time the universe is about @xmath48 second old , the scale factor is usually considered to have grown by a factor of about @xmath49 . in our case",
    ", this means that @xmath24 will have decayed by @xmath50 , in the process ( leaving behind a dense field of relativistic particles and radiation ) .",
    "it turns out ( as is shown in section 3 ) , that the time average value of the power index function , in the model , is @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "the cosmic vacuum energy density does not interfere with the usual early cosmological processes like big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) [ 18 ] , but instead allows such processes to proceed as predicted by the standard big bang model .",

    ", the field has its least dilution rate ( and is most interacting ) at epochs characterized by @xmath181 .      for @xmath182 .",
    "since @xmath183 , and noting that @xmath184 , we see from eq . 3.13 that @xmath185 .",
    "the implication here is that the interacting vacuum energy density , in this model , decays along a mean evolutionary path of @xmath186 , with oscillations of @xmath187 about this decay path .",
    "thus , in an expanding universe , according to this result , the interacting vacuum energy density is inherently a decaying system .",
    "this is , indeed , consistent with our premise ( in section 1 ) that @xmath32 must decay . in section 2.1 ,",
    "a heuristic argument was given to explain why @xmath32 is small now .",
    "it was seen that setting @xmath188 implies @xmath189 \\approx 10^{-120}\\lambda _ { pl}$ ] . in our treatment",
    ", we have recovered this value as the average of the oscillations in the power index , @xmath185 .",
    "thus our treatment solves the `` why is @xmath32 small now '' in a way that is consistent with current observations [ 1 ] .    in the past ,",
    "several phenomenological models have been developed ( see [ 6 ] and citations ) in which the vacuum energy density @xmath94 evolves with the scale factor as @xmath190 where the index @xmath191 has a fixed value . in such models",
    "@xmath94 is not explicitly interacting , as is indicated by the constant nature of the index @xmath191 .",
    "one such set of models that has gained considerable popularity ( see citations in [ 6 ] ) evolves @xmath94 as an inverse square power law ( @xmath192 ) , in the scale factor . for the reasons given above , the ( @xmath192 ) models [ 6 ]",
    "have in the past offered a satisfactory resolution of why @xmath32 is small now .",
    "it is worthy noting that the approach presented in the present work recovers this inverse square law as the mean decay path for an interacting vacuum energy density , @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath194 , as the universe ages @xmath195 so that ( see also section 4.2 ) @xmath31 can be replaced by its average value , @xmath196 . in this way",
    ", our model can be related to the inverse square , @xmath197 , models .    the positivity feature of @xmath132 ( see eq .",
    "3.13 ) , @xmath198 , ensures that even in the face of the oscillations in the power index function , the energy function @xmath141 is still always a decreasing single - valued function of the scale factor @xmath22 . to appreciate the physical significance of this feature ,",
    "one need only consider its contradiction , where @xmath141 evolves as a multi - valued function of @xmath199 .",
    "such a scenario would imply a two - way process where the vacuum ( dark ) energy and matter alternately turn into each other .",
    "globally , this would be unphysical ( at least in our part of the universe ) since it would result in periodic global violations of the entropy ( evolution ) law and suggest a rotating thermodynamic arrow of time . in this model , the creation processes tending to increase cosmic inertia are one - way and lead to entropy growth .",
    "thus the treatment ensures that the evolutionary law of @xmath200 is consistent with a causal universe .",
    "the preceding discussion depicts a universe undergoing periods of vacuum - driven acceleration , punctuated by periods of matter domination .",
    "one can gain some deeper insight in the cosmic dynamics during each of such acceleration periods by paying attention to the associated parameter @xmath16 .",
    "suppose , for example , at some point in time ( not unique ) during a given period of cosmic acceleration one can measure the contemporary values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 or just the ratio @xmath202 . then the maximum value @xmath203 , coinciding with @xmath204 during such a ( local ) period can not be lower , i.e. @xmath205 .",
    "this argument can be used to put reasonable bounds on @xmath16 during each such period since from eq .",
    "3.13 we must have @xmath206 thus any measured value of @xmath207 gives one information on the upper - bound on @xmath16 for that period ( which obviously would be better tightened by knowledge of @xmath203 ) . for example , as observations indicate , the current value is @xmath208 .",
    "this suggests that for the current ( cold @xmath209 ) universe , @xmath210 . moreover  from eq .",
    "3.10 one gets a lower bound on @xmath16 for the interactions to result in particle production . in the ( idealized ) limit @xmath211 , one finds that @xmath212 .",
    "the two bounds above thus constrain the parameter space of the dissipation parameter @xmath16 in the current universe to @xmath213    the one - way character of the dissipation process brings out yet another important feature . clearly as the universe gets older , the upper bound on @xmath16 grows as @xmath214 revealing the source of the current _ coincidence problem_. in the next section we put bounds on their relative amplitudes as the fields evolve .",
    "the above lower bound @xmath215 suggests that , in this model , the parameter space @xmath216 is forbidden with regard to matter creation .",
    "one can , however , imagine a time in the very early history of the universe when the vacuum energy therein was very large and in a purely potential @xmath217 form .",
    "such conditions would imply that , at the time , @xmath218",
    ". then eq .",
    "3.7 shows that @xmath219 and the vacuum energy density is constant in time ( albeit temporarily ) .",
    "only then could the universe as an engine seem to operate at @xmath220 efficiency .",
    "clearly this is the energy in a cosmological constant and it would inflate the universe . in turn , because inflation would tend to strongly and suddenly move the universe away from equilibrium conditions , the _ _  cosmic equilibrium conjecture _ _ implies that the associated backreation also be strong and sudden .",
    "thus , virtually all the physical ( matter ) modes are created in the early universe . the space @xmath221 during which matter creation is forbidden seems to provide a small window for inflation before the backreaction sets in as @xmath222 from below .",
    "accordingly , there are two consequences to this .",
    "first , it is in immediate reaction to this inflationary scenario that most of the present inertia ( matter ) and entropy is created . in turn",
    ", it is precisely the growth of such inertia ( i.e. @xmath223 ) that would lead the universe to a graceful exit from inflation .",
    "the inflationary scenario would probably last as long as it would take for the dissipation parameter to grow to @xmath224 .",
    "thus , in this model , inflation and its immediate self destruction are natural initial conditions to the current evolution of the universe .",
    "the preceding analysis for the evolution of @xmath94 has been based on the source equation ( eq .",
    "2.7 ) . in order to discuss the evolution of the matter fields density @xmath20 in the presence of a creation pressure @xmath17",

    "4.3 governs the evolution of the matter fields density @xmath20 in the model .    in this article",
    "the main aim has been to build a framework for discussing both the cosmological constant problem and point a way to discussing the _",
    "dynamical problem_. in the previous section we have touched on the question of  why @xmath4 is small now . it still remains to discuss the remaining problems . as it turns out ,",
    "the results of the preceding section are sufficient for such a discussion .",
    "consequently , we defer a discussion of the solutions to eq . 4.3 to concentrate on the two remaining problems .      using the results of eqs .",
    "3.10 to 3.12 one finds that the vacuum dilution rates relate directly to the vacuum to matter ratios @xmath232 in the universe . in particular , at @xmath233 ,  when the vacuum is at its most dilution rate , eq . 3.11",
    "constrains the minimum density value of the vacuum to @xmath234 on the other extreme at @xmath235 ,  when the vacuum is at its least dilution rate , eq .",
    "3.12 constrains the maximum density value of the vacuum to @xmath236 these results imply that as the universe evolves , the vacuum and matter fields are coupled through the coupling parameter @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "the vacuum then tracks the matter fields naturally within the bounds given by eqs .",
    "3.11 and 3.12 as @xmath237 in particular , during the radiation era @xmath238 , the vacuum oscillates between the values  @xmath239 . on the other hand , during the cold matter era @xmath240",
    ", the vacuum oscillates between the values @xmath241 .",
    "clearly , provided @xmath242 , the vacuum and matter field densities , @xmath94 and @xmath95 will track each other naturally .",
    "further , as pointed out in section .",
    "3 the one - way character of the dissipation process implies that as the universe gets older , the upper bound on @xmath16 grows so that @xmath243 in the far future as @xmath244 .",
    "thus , as long as the universe expands , the vacuum energy and matter density fields track each other with decaying amplitudes .",
    "this is our explanation of the so - called current _ coincidence problem_. further , as the universe gets older , the field oscillation amplitudes become smaller and also more stretched out since in this case @xmath245 @xmath246 . as a result",
    "the distant future universe creates conditions under which @xmath247 \\longrightarrow 2 $ ] . under these conditions",
    "@xmath31 can be replaced by its average value , @xmath185 .",
    "finally , since the dynamics of the universe is determined by the behavior of the fields therein , the foregoing results can be used to predict the future evolution of the universe . in this sense",
    ", the results also address the _",
    "dynamical problem_.      the model predicts that the universe undergoes periods of variable ( quasi - periodic ) acceleration .",
    "thus the observed current cosmic acceleration is one of these phases . in this respect",
    "the local ( in time ) dynamical evolution of the universe has two possibilities ( eq .",
    "3.10 ) : the universe is either moving away or towards a local @xmath248 . an increase in acceleration as a function of redshift @xmath249 , for example , would indicate the universe is moving away from a local maximum of vacuum domination @xmath250 , and vise versa . the effective equation of state , in eq . 3.15",
    "provides information about this variability and how the resulting motion in the current local phase deviates from that due to a ( would - be ) constant background @xmath32 vacuum .",
    "this behavior can be tested by futureexperiments like the snap project [ 17 ] .",
    "further , a signature of such oscillations should be imprinted on cmb .",
    "a consideration of these observables is ongoing and will be reported in future .",
    "in this paper a framework is proposed for addressing both the cosmological constant problem and the associated _ dynamical problem_. the underlying premise is that the background dark energy is both dynamical and interacting .",
    "such a feature gives rise to a universe that behaves as a cosmic thermodynamic engine , with the vacuum ( dark ) energy as the input fuel .",
    "this energy does work by accelerating the universe .",
    "however , like any engine , it is impossible for the universe to use all the fuel ( vacuum energy ) to do work without some of it being dissipated .",
    "the rationale for such vacuum energy dissipation and the implied increased inertia ( matter creation ) is embodied in a _ cosmic equilibrium  conjecture _ we make with regard to the need , on the part of the universe , to always seek for equilibrium conditions .",
    "the increase in inertia is facilitated by a creation pressure @xmath15 that arises as a back - reaction to the cosmic acceleration .",
    "the treatment , based on _ cosmic equilibriumconjecture , _ provides a basis for a first law of cosmic dynamics which naturally gives rise to the second ( entropy law ) of cosmic dynamics .",
    "as pointed out in section 2 ,  the why is @xmath24 small now ?",
    "part of the cosmological constant problem is addressed by noting that in this model @xmath251 , so that @xmath252 evolves as @xmath253 .",
    "such inverse square behavior was established in section 3 from the inflation era to date , @xmath52 has evolved by about @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that @xmath254 , a result which is consistent with observations .",
    "it was discussed , in some detail , how the vacuum energy density @xmath141 couples to the matter fields @xmath201 through matter creation pressure @xmath131 .",
    "this coupling is facilitated by a parameter @xmath16 which to date ( for the post - inflationary period ) we have constrained to @xmath255 .",
    "the process gives rise to a cosmic vacuum energy density which oscillates with a decaying amplitude . in turn",
    ", the coupled matter fields oscillate in sympathy .",
    "consequently , the two coupled fields track each other naturally , as they evolve in time .",
    "we have put bounds ( eq .",
    "4.4 ) on the relative evolution of the magnitudes of these fields up to the constrained free parameter @xmath16 .",
    "because vacuum dissipation is a one - way process , in this treatment , it follows that as the universe grows older the extremum values of the fields @xmath204 and @xmath256 become increasingly comparable so that @xmath214 .",
    "it is in this sense that the model addresses the _ coincidence problem _ and predicts that in future acceleration periods the fields will become even more comparable .",
    "the bounds put on the relative magnitudes of these fields ( eq.4.4 ) also imply that the future  evolution of these fields is predictable .",
    "further , since it is these same fields that drive the universe , in the first place , the result is that the future dynamics of the universe becomes equally predictable . in this way",
    "the model addresses the _",
    "dynamical problem .",
    "_    it is pointed out that the coupling parameter @xmath16  must have , at one time , had to grow from zero to its minimum operative value @xmath257 .",
    "this growth corresponds to the cosmic vacuum energy changing from a purely _ _  _ _ potential form at @xmath218  to a partially dissipated form @xmath258 .",
    "as long as @xmath259 , there would be little or no matter created and the universe , essentially , behaves as a near - perfect engine with @xmath260efficiency .",
    "the vacuum energy is then , mostly , in the form of a cosmological constant and the universe must inflate .",
    "consequently , our treatment requires inflation as a natural initial condition , both for creation and for the current classical dynamics of the universe .",
    "moreover , the growth of the dissipation parameter @xmath16 in the early universe ( and hence that of the creation pressure ) as a back - reaction to the inflationary acceleration , creates a natural graceful exit out of inflation through increase of the universe s internal energy .",
    "thus , in this model , the _ _  cosmic equilibrium conjecture _ _ implies that inflation ( through dissipative processes ) oversees its own ( almost immediate ) destruction , to end almost immediately .",
    "it is in this sense that the approach predicts both inflation and a graceful exit , while at the same time justifying matter creation .",
    "moreover , using the same mechanism , the universe enters and eventually exits from any subsequent accelerations , including the current one .",
    "the model proposed here makes testable predictions that the dynamics of the universe is predictable with a quasi - periodic character that can be verified by future experiments .",
    "there are several issues that the model raises which are under consideration for future report .",
