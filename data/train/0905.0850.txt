    "the progenitor channels of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are of vital importance both to our understanding of stellar evolution and to modern cosmology where sne ia are used as standard candles @xcite .",
    "they are also a key part of our understanding of galaxy formation by virtue of their contribution to the energy budget and chemical evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "a range of recent observations have indirectly suggested that at least some sne ia can be produced by a variety of different progenitor systems , though these claims are tentative . since",
    "no sn ia progenitor system has been conclusively identified pre - explosion , we must use more indirect approaches to understand their origin .",
    "the various progenitor scenarios proposed in the literature have very different predictions for the _ time delay _ between the episode of star formation producing progenitor systems , and the time until the detonation of sne ia and so observational constraints on the distribution of time delays ( dtd ) are thus critical for discriminating between the various scenarios .",
    "we will discuss each of them in turn .",
    "theory proposes that there are two main scenarios for the origin of sne ia ; in both cases the system giving rise to the sn ia is the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) in a binary system .",
    "we briefly describe the main channels here ; for a full review of progenitor scenarios and explosion mechanisms , see @xcite .      in the _ single degenerate scenario _",

    "] , initiating an sn ia . by the time of explosion",
    ", the donor can already be a slightly evolved subgiant . in this scenario ,",
    "the time delay distribution is expected to peak of @xmath2 myr with virtually no contribution past @xmath3 gyr @xcite .    both very short ( or ` prompt ' ) and very long @xmath4 gyr time delay for sd channels",
    "have been proposed : @xcite suggest that massive ( 6 - 7 @xmath5 ) ms donors are viable , while @xcite argue for helium star donors . in    both cases ,",
    "the detonation is expected to occur within @xmath6 myr .",
    "very long sd time delays are possible if the donor is a low - mass red giant ( rg)@xcite .      in the _ double - degenerate channel _ ( dd ) on the other hand",
    ", the thermonuclear explosion occurs when two white dwarfs in a binary system merge @xcite the range of possible time delays is set by the timescale for the formation of a wd binary system followed by the time needed for orbital decay via gravitational waves @xcite , which depends only on the binary separation following the common envelope phase .",
    "recent advances in our understanding of star formation  and absence thereof  in the local early - type population , together with a large volume of new observations make early - type galaxies an ideal laboratory for constraining the time delay distribution of low redshift sne ia .",
    "local early - type galaxies have generally been considered to have formed at high redshift and devoid of any current or recent star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that any sn ia progenitor systems are old with ages of several gyrs .",
    "this view has been revised in recent years by observations from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; @xcite ) uv space satellite : @xcite found that a substantial fraction of early - type galaxies observed by _",
    "galex _ had uv - optical colours incompatible with any scenarios of enhanced extreme horizontal branch stars ( uv upturn ; for a review of the current state see @xcite ) that could only be explained by the presence of small young stellar populations .",
    "this discovery was quantified using uv - optical colours to determine that between 1/3 and half of the local luminous early - type galaxy population harboured young stellar populations with mass fractions of a few percent and ages up to approximately 1 gyr @xcite and their presence has been detected out to z @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the _ galex _ near- and far - uv broadband photometry ( nuv , 1771 - 2831@xmath7 ; fuv , 1344 - 1786@xmath7 ; @xcite ) into the optical spectral energy distribution allows us to detect and quantify any young stellar populations in terms of age and mass - fraction , or to rule out their presence against the backdrop of an old , passively evolving bulk stellar population .",
    "this makes early - type galaxies in the local universe observed by _",
    "galex _ an ideal laboratory to constrain and quantify the the ages of sn ia progenitors for those events which occurred in early - type galaxies .",
    "late - type galaxies with extended star formation histories are not suitable for constraining time delays out to interesting ages , as they always harbour stars of very young ages from ongoing star formation .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < ,",

    "] , and the age of the bulk old stellar population .",
    "we model this dominant component as a single stellar population ( ssp ) of varying age from 115 gyr .",
    "the young component is represented by a composite stellar population describing a brief burst of star formation declining with an e - folding time of 100 myr .",
    "the key parameters of this young burst are its age @xmath9 and its mass - fraction @xmath13 , which are somewhat degenerate with each other .",
    "@xcite showed that the folding in of the luminosity - weighted age and metallicity measured from stellar absorption indices ( lick indices ) can break this degeneracy , but sdss spectra are not available for all sn ia host galaxies , and the majority of our host galaxies are so nearby that the @xmath14 spectroscopic fibre of sdss samples only the very central part , which represents a biased sub - sample of the bulk stellar population , as many early - type galaxies exhibit radial gradients in their stellar population parameters @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy between the mass - fraction and the age of any young stellar population represents a fundamental limit to the constraints that can be derived from applying this method .",
    "the limit on the age of the young population @xmath9 that we can derive is a function of the lowest mass - fraction @xmath13 that we probe down to .",
    "the age @xmath9 is not a strong function of the mass - fraction @xmath13 until below the @xmath15 level , where even uv observations fail to be sufficiently sensitive .",
    "we thus range in mass - fraction @xmath13 from 100% down to 1% , far lower than is possible with optical photometry alone .",
    "all constraints on the age @xmath9 derived here are thus subject to the caveat that we do not account for young populations below the @xmath16 level .",
    "we generate a library of photometric data points as a function of the parameters described above , resulting in 6.5 million model seds in the restframe of each sn ia host galaxy using the models of @xcite .",
    "we fit each host galaxy to all library seds and compute the @xmath17 statistic for each , convert them to probabilities , and marginalise over all parameters except for the young age @xmath9 in order to obtain the probability distribution function @xmath18 . in order to account for unknown systematic errors in the sdss and _ galex _ zeropoints and other effects ,",
    "we add in quadrature a uniform error of 0.1 mag to each band .",
    "we have tested the effect of adding various amounts of systematic error to broad - band photometry for similar codes in general , and for the data set and specific implementation used in this paper . by increasing the amount of assumed systematic error , the minimum set of parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) do not change and individual fits do not change from cases where a young population is detected to one where a young population is ruled out .",
    "increasing the assumed error increases the size of the errors on ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) at the minimum , or lowers the limit on @xmath19 in cases where no young component is detected .",
    "while the sdss photometric system is exquisitely calibrated , down to the 1 - 3% level for dr6 , the photometric repeatability of _ galex _ is @xmath10.03 and 0.05 mag in nuv and fuv , respectively @xcite . given this , we believe a 0.1 mag error may be a conservative overestimate .",
    "we note that the main driver in detecting and ruling out the presence of young stellar populations are uv - optical colours whose observed range spans 5 - 7 mag , substantially larger than the 0.1 mag error .",
    "we present the results of our sed fitting analysis in figures [ fig : prob_young ] and [ fig : prob_old ] and table [ tab : sample ] . for each supernova and host galaxy in our sample , we plot the marginalised probability distribution function @xmath18 from 100 myr to 15 gyr .",
    "the supernova host galaxies in our sample can be divided into two classes : those where a small young stellar populations with ages of @xmath21 gyr , are present , and those where any such young population is ruled out down to 1% by mass - fraction .",
    "this limit corresponds to the age resolution of the near - uv ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : color_evolution ] ) . for those where a young component is resolved",
    ", we can calculate the best - fit age ( figure [ fig : prob_young ] ) , while for those without , we can only report lower limits on the age of the youngest stellar population  and therefore sn ia progenitor  present ( figure [ fig : prob_old ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "the results for the general early - type population are presented in @xcite .      for 14 out of 21 sn ia host galaxies in our sample , we do detect and constrain the presence of a small ( few percent ) young stellar population in the host galaxy .",
    "the age of this young population represents the shortest possible time delay for these sne ia , though it is of course possible that these particular sne have _ longer _ time delays , up to the age of the bulk stellar population . in figure",
    "[ fig : prob_young ] , we show @xmath18 for all 14 host galaxies with resolved young components . in each panel",
    ", we indicate the best - fit age with a dashed black line . we compute the 68% two - sided confidence interval and shade it with single gray hatches . in table",
    "[ tab : sample ] , we report the best - fit ages and the two - sided confidence interval .      for the remaining 7 sn",
    "ia host galaxies , we do not detect the presence of any young stellar population down to the 1% level in mass - fraction .",
    "for these , it only makes sense to compute a one - sided confidence interval .",
    "we shade the 68% and 95% confidence limits on the @xmath18 distribution in figure [ fig : prob_old ] and report these limits in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we also give these one - sided confidence levels for those host galaxies _ with _ detected young components .    at 95% confidence , we find that four sne ia ( sn2003an , sn2003ia , sn2004h and sn2007jh ) have time delays of at least 1 gyr , with sn2003an and sn2007jh with minimum time delays in excess of 2 gyr .",
    "given the caveats discussed in section [ sec : method ] , _ this implies that long time delays for sne ia do occur in nature and at least @xmath22 ( 4/21 ) of sne ia in early - type host galaxies have time delays longer than 1 gyr .",
    "_ due to the inclusion of _ galex _ observations , the robustness of this statement is greater than that of any previous attempts to establish long time delays for some sne ia .",
    "we are now able to plot the distribution of _ minimum _ time delays ( dmtd ) for sne ia that occurred in early - type host galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : age_hist ] , we plot the histograms of the dmtd for sne ia at the 95% limit .",
    "the minimum age distribution ranges from 275 myr to 1.25 gyr , with two sne at @xmath23 gyr and has a mean age of 650 myr .",
    "there are _ no _ cases where ages approaching @xmath24 myr or below are allowed , so it appears that there are no ` prompt ' sne ia in our sample myr is common , others are also used . for example @xcite use 500 myr . by their definition ,",
    "a number of the sne ia studies here would be classified as prompt . ] .",
    "several works have remarked that sub - luminous sne ia occur in early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "under the assumption that these host galaxies contain only old stellar population , this was taken to be evidence that sub - luminous sne ia have very long time delays on the order of several gyr @xcite .",
    "although our sample of sub - luminous sne ia is very small , we find that in the case of two sub - luminous sn ia , a shorter time delay is possible .",
    "our sample contains three sub - luminous sne ia , sn 2003au , sn2007ax and sn2007cf .",
    "of these , sn2003au and sn2007ax ( the faintest sn ia observed yet ; @xcite ) both are in host galaxies with young stellar components , while only sn 2007cf has a 95% lower confidence limit of @xmath4 gyr , i.e. only one sub - luminous sn ia definitely has a long time delay .",
    "while this does _ not _ prove that sub - luminous sne ia have short time delays , it clearly leaves open the possibility that they do .",
    "what do our results imply for the various proposed progenitor channels ? there are two ways we can explore implications of the results in this paper for progenitor channels .",
    "we can assume that the bulk of sne ia originate from the youngest stellar population present in the host galaxy , rather than from the old bulk population .",
    "this assumption implies that the dmtd in figure [ fig : age_hist ] is a good approximation of the true dtd and so we can take the dmtd and compare them to the predictions of various theoretical calculations of delay times .",
    "we stress that we can not directly test with the current data whether this assumption is a good one and it remains plausible that the dmtd does not approximate the dtd well at all and that the young populations detected by _",
    "galex _ are mostly unrelated to the observed sne ia . in the following discussion",
    ", we explore what the dmtd implies for progenitor channels of sne ia assuming that it closely approximates the dtd :     distributions in figures [ fig : prob_young ] and [ fig : prob_old ] ( also given in table [ tab : sample ] ) . the mean and median age are 800myr and 650 myr respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]      scenarios that give rise to ` prompt ' sne ia , such as massive ms or helium star donors @xcite do not appear to occur in our sample .",
    "this is not necessarily obvious , as a few percent of early - type galaxies do have optically blue colours and host sufficiently young stellar populations @xcite , though the sample used in this paper does not contain any such objects .",
    "the majority of sne ia in early - types have minimum time delays on the order of a few hundred myr .",
    "if we assume that the actual dtd is approximated well by figure [ fig : age_hist ] , then the binary population synthesis predictions for the sd ms + co wd scenario matches the distribution of ages well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of whether figure [ fig : age_hist ] is a good representation of the actual dtd , a minority of sne ia must have long time delays in excess of 1 gyr .",
    "the two progenitor channels that might account for these long time delays are the dd channel , can naturally produce such long time delays @xcite , and the sd channel with rg donors .",
    "calculations for the rate due to wd+rg progenitor systems predict that they can not account for all sne ia in passive host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have used sdss optical and _ galex _ uv photometry to measure the minimum time delay for a sample of 21 sne ia hosted in local early - type galaxies .",
    "we constrain the age , or rule out the presence , of any young stellar population in the host galaxies down to the 1% level by mass . from this , we are able to construct the distribution of minimum time delays ( dmtd ) for the 21 sne ia in our sample .",
    "we find :    1 .",
    "there are no prompt ( @xmath6 myr ) sne ia in our sample .",
    "2 .   for 14 out of 21 sn ia host galaxies ,",
    "we detect and constrain young stellar populations , yielding a range of minimum time delays of 275 myr to 1.25 gyr , with a mean of 650 myr .",
    "3 .   for 4 out of 21 sn ia host galaxies , we can rule out the presence of any young stellar populations younger than 1 gyr , implying minimum time delays longer than that . for two of these ,",
    "the 95% lower confidence limits rule out any time delays shorter than 2 gyr .",
    "4 .   two out of three sub - luminous sne ia occurred in host galaxies with detected ( few 100 myr ) young populations .",
    "only one occurred in a host galaxy where young populations ( @xmath21 gyr ) can be ruled out .",
    "we find that the predictions for the single degenerate ms + co wd channel @xcite best matches the distribution of minimum time delays for the majority of our sample and that at least four require a scenario allowing for time delays greater than 1 gyr , such as a rg + co wd or dd channel . under the extreme assumption that the dmtd is a good approximation of the true dtd , the sd ms + co wd channel could account for up to 70% of all sne ia in early - type galaxies , though the actual percentage could be much lower in case this assumption is not warranted .",
