    "in order to study combinatorial aspects of vector fields , we restrict our attention to surfaces that are compact , connected , and orientable .",
    "the poincare - hopf theorem yields a simple combinatorial invariant of a vector field on such a surface ; in particular , it tells us that @xmath2 where we write @xmath3 for the numbers of sources , sinks , and saddles , respectively , and @xmath0 for the number of holes in @xmath4 , also known as the genus of @xmath4 .",
    "we seek to extend this simple result to a more powerful combinatorial invariant in the form of a graph embedded on @xmath4 , with edges representing integral curves of the vector field . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "we must restrict our attention to structurally stable vector fields , or vector fields whose geometric behavior is unchanged by small perturbations .    we show that our graph invariant is a triangulation of @xmath4 , and , using this machinery , we seek to describe classes of vector fields that may be deformed into each other via simple , local operations we term vector field cobordisms . in our main result , we show that all structurally stable vector fields on the sphere are cobordant in this sense , and we discuss the extent to which this holds true for surfaces of higher genus .",
    "unfortunately , for surfaces of higher genus , the existence of periodic integral curves hampers the project , so we leave the readers with some open questions .",
    "consider a smooth , structurally stable vector field on a ( compact , connected , orientable ) surface . by peixoto s theorem @xcite ,",
    "structural stability is equivalent to a simple set of properties , as follows .    *",
    "the set of non - wandering points consists only of periodic orbits and fixed points .",
    "in other words , an integral curve becomes either a periodic orbit or a fixed point in the limit .",
    "* the set of fixed points is finite and consists only of hyperbolic equilibrium points .",
    "in particular , there are saddles of degree @xmath5 , sinks , and sources .",
    "* there are a finite number of attracting or repelling periodic orbits .",
    "* there are no saddle - saddle connections .",
    "we shall call such a vector field _",
    "generic _ , and in particular a generic vector field with no such periodic orbits _",
    "primitive_. the fixed points consist of sinks , sources , and saddles , the numbers of which we will denote throughout @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "suppose we have a primitive vector field @xmath9 on a surface @xmath4 .",
    "as it has a finite number of fixed points , it is natural to construct a graph @xmath10 ( or just @xmath11 if @xmath9 is known from context ) with the vertices corresponding to the fixed points of @xmath9 .",
    "we then say that there is a directed edge from @xmath8 to @xmath12 for each homotopy class of integral curves that start at @xmath8 and end at @xmath12 .",
    "we notice a few properties    * there is a natural way to pick an isotopy class of embeddings of @xmath11 on @xmath4 . * by structural stability of @xmath9",
    ", @xmath11 must be 3-colorable with the colors corresponding to sources , sinks , and saddles . * also by structural stability , each saddle point must have in - degree 2 and out - degree 2 .",
    "this graph @xmath10 will be our primary tool for studying vector fields .",
    "if we remove all the sources and associated edges from @xmath11 , we get a new graph , which we denote @xmath13 ( or just @xmath14 ) .",
    "we notice that in @xmath14 , every saddle connects to exactly @xmath15 sinks .",
    "therefore , we can construct yet another ( undirected ) graph @xmath16 where the vertices are the sinks of @xmath14 , and there is an edge between two ( not necessarily distinct ) sinks for each saddle that is connected to both of those sinks .",
    "we can construct similar graphs @xmath17 and @xmath18 by interchanging sinks and sources .",
    "it is immediately clear by definition that @xmath19 consists of @xmath6 vertices and @xmath8 edges , and that @xmath20 consists of @xmath7 vertices and @xmath8 edges .",
    "furthermore , all of these graphs may be naturally embedded on @xmath4 , as @xmath11 itself may be embedded on @xmath4 .",

    ", we draw the torus as a square whose opposite edges are glued together .",
    "figure [ fig : torusexamplegraph ] shows a natural embedding of @xmath23 on the torus",
    ". figures [ fig : torusexamplesaddle ] and [ fig : torusexamplesource ] are embeddings of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .     the sphere ( stereographically projected to the plane),width=226 ]     in the previous example , width=226 ]    in figure [ fig : saddlegraph ] , we give an example of a possible value of @xmath13 on the sphere . for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we have stereographically projected the sphere onto the plane .",
    "figure [ fig : sinkgraph ] then gives us a possible value of @xmath16 on the sphere .",
    "given an embegging of a graph into @xmath4 , we define a region to be a connected component of the complement of that graph in @xmath4 .",
    "given an embedding of the graph @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in @xmath4 ,    * in each region , there is exactly one source ( sink ) when the vertices of @xmath11 are added .",
    "* each region ( taken as an open set ) is diffeomorphic to a open set of @xmath26 . *",
    "the graph @xmath19 is connected .",
    "[ thm : gconnect ]    each region must contain at least one source , as each region has some sink on its boundary which must connect to a source in the region via an integral curve .",
    "say that there are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 vertices , edges , faces respectively in @xmath19 .",
    "this means that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , with equality if and only if there is exactly one source of @xmath11 in each region . letting @xmath0 denote the genus of @xmath4 ,",
    "we can write the poincare - hopf result as @xmath33 and euler s result as @xmath34 with equality only when each region is diffeomorphic to an open set of @xmath26 and @xmath19 is connected .",
    "combining our observations results in @xmath35 thus , both equalities cases hold , proving the theorem .",
    "of course the same argument can be made for @xmath20 .    from the first point of theorem [ thm : gconnect ] and the observation that saddles have in degree 2 and out degree 2 , it follows immediately that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dual graphs on @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 has at least one saddle .",
    "let us look at a single region in @xmath13 . as @xmath9 contains a saddle , @xmath14 contains an edge .",
    "suppose that the region is bounded by the edges @xmath36 in order ( edges may repeat , but would then be oriented differently ) .",
    "let us examine an edge @xmath37 .",
    "then it is not hard to see that both vertices of @xmath37 must define a homotopy class of integral curves ( with the correct orientation ) connecting to the single source in the region , for they have nowhere else to connect .",
    "this gives us a triangle between the single source and these two vertices .",
    "hence , when @xmath11 is reconstructed , the particular region of @xmath14 is partitioned into triangles .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 is a triangulation of the entire manifold .",
    "as long as @xmath9 has at least one saddle , @xmath11 is a triangulation of @xmath4 .",
    "note that by the word triangulation , we dictate not only that each region be triangular , but also that each region be diffeomorphic to an open set of @xmath26 , as in theorem [ thm : gconnect ] .",
    "[ cor : triangulation ]    of course , @xmath11 will also satisfy some additional trivial properties . as @xmath9 is structurally stable , with no saddle - saddle connections , @xmath11 will be @xmath38-colorable by the `` colors '' : sink , source , and saddle .",
    "in fact , each sink will have out - degree 0 , each source in - degree 0 , and each saddle both in - degree and out - degree 2 .",
    "call a graph that satisfies all of these properties _ saddled_. it happens that @xmath11 is characterized by being a saddled triangulation .    given a graph @xmath11 on a surface @xmath4",
    ", there is a primitive vector field @xmath9 satisfying @xmath39 if and only if @xmath11 is a saddled triangulation of @xmath4 .",
    "corollary [ cor : triangulation ] proves the forward direction .",
    "we shall now show the other direction .",
    "suppose @xmath11 is a saddled triangulation of @xmath4 .",
    "we can embed @xmath11 into @xmath4 in such a way that all the edges are smooth curves .",
    "this splits the surface into some triangular regions .",
    "we note that because @xmath11 is a saddled triangulation , the vertices of each triangle must be a source , a sink , and a saddle .",
    "it is sufficient to specify the flow in each triangular region .",
    "we can just specify the flow to be diffeomorphic to the one in figure [ fig : triangle ] .",
    "suppose now that @xmath9 does have periodic integral curves .",
    "we can think of each periodic curve as dividing a small open set around it into two regions .",
    "consider its behavior in one of the regions .",
    "the curve acts either as a ` sink ' or a ` source , ' with integral curves either progressing away from it or towards it in its neighborhood .",
    "in fact , within this region , we can close off the integral curve ( or associate it with a single point ) in such a way that it truly does define either a sink or a source ( and no periodic curve ) ( see figure [ fig : psink ] ) .    stated more clearly",
    ", suppose there exist periodic integral curves .",
    "ennumerate the regions @xmath40 into which they divide @xmath4 . in each region , the bounding integral curves may be associated with ( closed off to yield ) points , with resulting manifolds @xmath41 and derived vector fields @xmath42 .",
    "each of the derived vector fields exist on the corresponding manifold and are equivalent to @xmath9 except that the original periodic curves are now associated with either sinks or sources .",
    "in particular , this means that each @xmath43 is primitive , and therefore the results of the previous sections hold .",
    "the object of this section is to describe elementary local transformations of vector fields , which we call _ vector field cobordisms_. we define two classes of cobordisms for primitive vector fields . given two sources , each connecting to a given saddle",
    ", we can smoothly deform the vector field in such a way that the sources and the saddle are ` pushed ' together .",
    "outside of a small neighborhood of the three points , the entire neighborhood acts as a source ( see figure [ fig : cobordismprocess ] ) , with the vector field emanating away from the region .",
    "thus we define a cobordism to be the transformation from this vector field to another where the three points have been identified with a single source . of course , the reverse transformation is also a cobordism .",
    "the second class of cobordisms we define takes two sinks and a saddle to a sink in an identical way .",
    "we call these source - cobordisms and sink - cobordisms , respectively .",
    "we say that two vector fields are _ cobordant _ if there is a series of cobordisms and isotopies that takes one to the other .",
    "this gives us _",
    "cobordism classes _ of vector fields .",
    "consider the effect of cobordisms on the graph @xmath16 .",
    "sink - cobordisms act on two adjacent ( and distinct ! ) vertices and an edge between them by removing the edge and equating the two vertices , so that all the edges of each vertex are now assigned to the new vertex .",
    "source - cobordisms take an edge between two ( distinct ! ) regions and remove it , equating the regions . in this way",
    ", cobordisms are not only operations on vector fields , but also on connected graphs embedded on @xmath4 .",
    "every primitive vector field can be reduced via cobordisms to a vector field with just one source and one sink .",
    "[ lem : onegraph ]    suppose a vector field with more sinks ( for example ) could not be further reduced via cobordisms .",
    "but @xmath19 is connected by theorem 1 , so there are two adjacent distinct vertices with an edge between them , and we can reduce via a sink - cobordism .",
    "on the other hand , all primitive vector fields have infinitely many integral curves that need a place to start and a place to end , so every primitive vector field must contain at least one sink and one source .    call such a primitive vector field with just one source and one sink _",
    "reduced_. to what extent can these differ ?",
    "the poincare - hopf theorem tells us that the number of saddles is specified at @xmath44 .",
    "each saddle must connect twice to the source and twice to the sink .",
    "however , we know that @xmath11 is a triangulation of @xmath4 , so we see that the number of homotopy classes of integral curves between the sink and the source is thus fixed at @xmath45 ( provided @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , given the manifold s",
    "genus @xmath0 , there is only one possible graph @xmath47 for @xmath48 reduced .",
    "care must be taken , however , as @xmath11 may embed in multiple ways into @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , if we assign a certain embedding to the identity element in the mapping class group of @xmath4 , then the different embeddings of @xmath11 correspond to elements of the mapping class group .",
    "there is not , therefore , necessarily only one cobordism class of primitive vector fields .",
    "it is true , however , that if @xmath4 is a sphere , all primitive vector fields are cobordant . as above ,",
    "all primitive vector fields are certainly cobordant to a reduced vector field with just one sink , one source , and one homotopy class of integral curves between them .",
    "as the mapping class group of the sphere is trivial , we can deform all such vector fields into each other , so there is just one cobordism class .",
    "there is just one cobordism class of primitive vector fields on the sphere .",
    "we now show that there is one cobordism class for the torus and we conjecture that there is also only one cobordism class for surfaces of higher genus .",
    "suppose we have two vector fields @xmath49 on @xmath4 such that the natural embeddings of @xmath10 and @xmath47 are isotopic .",
    "because these graphs are triangulations , it is clear that there is an isotopy that takes @xmath9 to @xmath48 .",
    "next , we suppose that we have two vector fields @xmath49 such that the natural embeddings of @xmath18 and @xmath50 are the same . by corollary [ cor : triangulation",
    "] , each region made by these graphs is diffeomorphic to @xmath26 , and there is exactly one sink in each of these regions . because the mapping class group of @xmath26 is trivial , there is only one way to put one sink in each region up to isotopy . in other words",
    ", we conclude that @xmath10 is isotopic to @xmath47 , which in turn implies that @xmath9 is isotopic to @xmath48 .",
    "call the complete tripartite graph with one source , one sink , and two saddles @xmath11 . by lemma [ lem : onegraph ] , we know that every vector field is cobordant to a vector field @xmath9 such that @xmath51 as a graph .",
    "@xmath20 is just the graph with one vertex and two edges .",
    "therefore , to show that every vector field on the torus is cobordant , it is sufficient to show that any embedding of @xmath20 is cobordant to every other embedding . in particular",
    "it is sufficient to show that the simple embedding in figure [ fig : simpleexample ] is cobordant to every other embedding .",
    "suppose we have an embedding @xmath52 that is not isotopic to this one .",
    "there is some element of the mapping class group of the torus that takes our simple embedding to @xmath52 .",
    "if two embeddings correspond to the same element of the mapping class group , there is an isotopy taking one to the other .",
    "therefore , we want to show that we can use cobordisms to reach an embedding corresponding to any element of the mapping class group .    :",
    "note , we represent the torus as a square with opposite edges set equal , width=151 ]    however , we can perform the series of cobordisms shown in figure [ fig : dehntwist ] . in this way ,",
    "we have found two embeddings that are not isotopic but are cobordant .",
    "in fact , we notice that figure [ fig : dehntwist ] simply gives us a dehn twist on the torus along one of the two edges @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the graph .",
    "therefore , we want to show that we can reach every element of the mapping class group by performing dehn twists along these two edges . unfortunately , we have a slight complication .",
    "as we perform these dehn twists , the edges along which we perform the twists move . to deal with this problem , we draw two curves @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we draw @xmath55 ( resp .",
    "@xmath56 ) where @xmath53 ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) starts out in figure [ fig : simpleexample ] . as we perform the dehn twists around @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we move both @xmath53 and @xmath54 around , but we leave @xmath55 and @xmath56 stationary .",
    "now , we also use @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the dehn twists around @xmath55 and @xmath56 . note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are elements of the mapping class group of the torus .",
    "suppose that through dehn twists around @xmath53 and @xmath54 we have obtained an element @xmath59 of the mapping class group of the torus .",
    "how can we describe another dehn twist around @xmath53 . because @xmath53 has been moved by @xmath59 , we must have that a dehn twist around @xmath53 acts like the element @xmath60 of the mapping class group . applying this to @xmath59 ,",
    "we get @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we see that performing a dehn twist around @xmath53 is the same as multiplying on the right by @xmath57 .",
    "the same can be said about @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "however , we know by the lickorish twist theorem @xcite that @xmath57 and @xmath58 generate the mapping class group of the torus .",
    "it follows that we can get every element of the mapping class group by performing dehn twists around @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we must have that the torus has only one cobordims class , as we desired .",
    "when allowing for periodic curves , the two cobordisms we have defined will certainly not be sufficient to alter or remove periodic curves , thus creating an infinite class of cobordism classes . to account for this",
    ", we propose an additional three classes of cobordisms , each of which is in spirit a local collapsing of two objects , just like our previous cobordisms .",
    "consider a periodic curve which borders a region and acts as a source in that region .",
    "consider also a point source in the region and a saddle which connects to both the point source and the periodic curve .",
    "once again , we can continuously deform the two points together and into a neighborhood of the periodic curve , such that the periodic curve , when deformed slightly to encompass the two points , continues to act as a source .",
    "as above , we can then delete the point source and saddle and treat their integral curves as integral curves of the periodic curve .",
    "there is of course a symmetric cobordism with a sink - like periodic curve , a point sink , and a saddle .",
    "these cobordisms provide a mechanism for handling periodic curves , but they still do not allow us to remove periodic curves , which is essential to avoid large sets of cobordism classes . thus we propose a final cobordism , not quite in the spirit of the others . given a region of genus 0 bordered by exactly one periodic curve which acts as a source ( sink ) , and containing exactly one zero point , we propose that we can shrink the periodic curve to a point , swallowing the zero point inside , and leaving the remains of the periodic curve to act either as a sink or source depending on the original behavior of the periodic curve outside this region .",
    "this allows us to ` swallow ' periodic curves provided their interiors are as simple as possible ( reduced , effectively ) .",
    "this operation is shown in figure [ fig : pccobordism ] .",
    "all structurally stable vector fields on the sphere are cobordant to each other .    if there are no periodic curves , we are done as above",
    ". we will proceed by induction on the number of periodic curves , assuming there are @xmath62 periodic curves in the smallest counterexample to the theorem .",
    "certainly , we can always find a region bounded by just one periodic curve .",
    "treating this region itself as a sphere , we note that all cobordisms of the new sphere are proper cobordisms of the original sphere",
    ". therefore we can reduce this to the vector field with just one sink and one source , one of which corresponds to the original periodic curve .",
    "then we can use our final cobordism to remove the periodic curve , thus contradicting the induction hypothesis .",
    "given an appropriate vector field @xmath9 on a surface @xmath4 , we have developed the combinatorial tool of a graph @xmath11 on @xmath4 composed of homotopy classes of integral curves of @xmath9 . by reducing the graph @xmath11 to just sinks or just sources and then rebuilding ,",
    "we have shown that @xmath11 is a triangulation of @xmath4 .",
    "using this fact , combined with the tools of the sink and source - only graphs , we have demonstrated that vector fields on the sphere may be transformed into each other via basic localized operations which we call cobordisms .",
    "unfortunately , the presence of periodic integral curves keeps us from generalizing to higher genus surfaces .",
    "this motivates a number of open questions :    * are all primitive vector fields on surfaces of higher genus cobordant ? * how many cobordism classes of generic vector fields exist for surfaces of fixed genus with fixed periodic curve configurations ? * how many cobordism classes of generic vector fields exist for surfaces of fixed genus with fixed numbers of periodic curves ? * what can be said about vector fields which are not structurally stable ?",
