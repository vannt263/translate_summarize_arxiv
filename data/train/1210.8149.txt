    ", new observational methods such as integral field spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) and spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , @xcite ) have revealed its more intricate structure .",
    "our goal is to shed light on processes behind large - scale galactic winds .",
    "very little is known about their total extent , energetics and importance in the context of galaxy evolution . by studying the most spatially extended emission ,",
    "we can obtain a better understanding of the total kinetic energy of the wind .",
    "there are many questions that remain unanswered for m82 s outflow .",
    "how old is the wind and how far does it extend ?",
    "is it powered by radiation pressure or wind pressure , or a combination of both ? is the source of energy impulsive or sustained over many dynamical times ?",
    "is most of the outflowing material swept up or entrained from the disk ? does the wind material escape the galaxy or fall back to the disk ? to have any chance of answering these questions , we need a better understanding of the most basic properties of the large - scale wind .    the most distant gas cloud in m82 is the ` cap ' originally discovered in h@xmath0 and x - ray emission at a radius of 11.6 kpc along the minor axis of m82 @xcite .",
    "strong uv emission provides evidence for reflecting dust in the cloudlets that make up the cap @xcite .",
    "the metal abundances of o , ne , mg , si , and fe of x - ray emitting gas in the cap suggest that most of the metals arise from a circumnuclear starburst dominated by type ii supernovae @xcite .    we now show that the dominant ionization source in the cap provides an important clue to the wind s origin and history .",
    "@xcite suggested the cap is either photoionized by uv photons from the nuclear starburst region or by a shock being driven by the hot wind into a dense halo cloud , or a combination of both .",
    "the x - ray observations already support the idea that the wind reaches the distance of the cap , but are the optical emission line diagnostics consistent with a wind - driven shock ?    therefore , in order to obtain emission line intensity map and line ratio maps at high spatial resolution , we carried out fabry - perot observations of m82 s cap with the subaru telescope .",

    "the observed [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios ( table [ tb : data - knot ] ) are similar to those of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the observed ratios do not exceed the maximum starburst line defined by @xcite , unless the [ ] @xmath15007/h@xmath34 ratio is larger than @xmath10 3 .",

    "the calculated ionization parameter @xmath46 is consistent with that estimated from emission line ratios , if we assume @xmath47 .",
    "the larger distance from the ionization source than for typical regions leads to smaller ionization parameter and larger [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "the number of the ionizing photons which each knot receives is almost the same , and the ionization parameter depends on the knot electron density only .",
    "the calculated line ratios whose electron densities are smaller than 10 @xmath25 are almost the same . for these reasons",

    "@xcite uses h@xmath0 surface brightness averaged over the projected length of the m82 cap for the calculation of the escape fraction of ionizing photons . since the required escape fraction is only @xmath103 % , they considered that the m82 starburst regions can provide enough ionizing photons for the m82 cap .",
    "meanwhile , our high resolution image reveals that m82 cap is patchy and its filling factor @xmath44 is much smaller than 1 ( figure [ fig : image-3dii ] ( b ) ) .",

    "since the surface brightness of 6 @xmath11 10@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 arcsec@xmath16 corresponds to 1 rayleigh at the h@xmath0 wavelength , the h@xmath0 emission measure of the knot h - c is 16.5 rayleigh .",
    "the required number of ionizing photons is 3.7 @xmath11 10@xmath19 @xmath15 s@xmath4 at the distance of m82 , using the h@xmath0 recombination rate @xmath28 = 8.7 @xmath11 10@xmath29 @xmath30 s@xmath4 @xcite . whereas the ionizing photon flux from the nuclear starburst region is 10@xmath51 photons s@xmath4 @xcite , and 6 @xmath11",
    "10@xmath19 @xmath15 s@xmath4 at the distance of knot h - c from the m82 nuclear starburst region .",

    "this escape fraction is an order of magnitude larger than what has been measured in the galaxy ( @xmath106 % : @xcite ) and dwarfs to date ( @xmath103 % : @xcite ) . in passing ,",
    "we note that 3d simulations of uv radiative transfer in superwinds indicate that higher values are possible in extreme cases @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite unlikely that the m82 cap clouds are ionized by photons from the m82 starburst regions .",
    "we consider shock ionization to be a more likely explanation , as we discuss in the next section .      in order to explain the h@xmath0 emission in the cap",
    ", @xcite first suggested that the m82 superwind can drive a shock into the underlying gas cloud .",
    "the gas metallicity , which is presently unknown , is likely to fall in the range 0.11 @xmath52 depending on whether the gas is infalling or entrained with the wind flow .",
    "the threshold metallicity for infalling gas at the present epoch appears to be close to 0.1@xmath52 in all observations of the local universe to date @xcite .",
    "we regard this value as a lower limit because the outer envelope in the m81 group appears to be material stripped from the outer disk of one or more galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cap is unlikely to be entrained gas from the disk because dense material is broken up very quickly by rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite , as observed in the wind filaments close to the disk .",
    "we compare the observed line ratios with those calculated from a fast shock model ( @xmath53 200 km s@xmath4 ) of @xcite .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios in the shock model are larger than 0.3 , while the observed values are mostly less than 0.3 ( figure [ fig : n2ha - s2 ha ] ( b ) ) . but this may reflect the lower expected metallicity in the cap .",
    "fast shocks in a low metallicity gas may be able to explain the observed [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "the computed [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios fall in the range 0.1 to 0.3 , which is similar to the observed values .",
    "but if fast shock excitation is dominant , the observed [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios should correlate with [ ] /h@xmath0 , because both ratios increase in lock step with an increase in shock velocity ( figure [ fig : n2ha - s2 ha ] ( c ) ) ; however , no such correlation between these ratios is found .",
    "a more compelling argument against fast shocks is the kinematically ` cold ' line emission observed across the ` cap ' region , an issue we return to below .",
    "thus fast shocks are unlikely to be the dominant ionization source of the cap today .",
    "next we compare the observed ratios with those calculated from slow to intermediate shock models , i.e. , 40 km s@xmath54 130 km s@xmath4 , given by @xcite ( figure [ fig : n2ha - s2 ha ] ( a ) ) . in this shock velocity range ,",
    "[ ] /h@xmath0 ratios increase as shock velocity increases , while [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios neither increase nor decrease monotonically . in figure [ fig : n2ha - s2 ha ] ( a ) , the observed points at the cap knots are distributed along the line of slow shock model .",
    "the calculated [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios are 0.10 and 0.58 at @xmath55 = 60 km s@xmath4 , and 0.27 and 0.44 at @xmath55 = 80 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "therefore , shock velocities of 60 km s@xmath4 and 80 km s@xmath4 can also explain the observed [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "model comparisons for shock velocities higher than 80 km s@xmath4 are ruled out .",
    "the superwind is powered by kinetic energy from some combination of stellar winds , radiation pressure and supernovae in the m82 starburst region . here",
    "we examine whether the momentum is enough to produce the observed shock .",
    "we compare the inferred range of shock velocities ( 4080 km s@xmath4 ) with the superwind velocity of a spherically - symmetric model for m82 by @xcite .",
    "their model fits well with the observed thermal pressure profile of m82 within @xmath101 kpc , and the pressure profiles at the larger radii than 0.5 kpc are consistent with the @xmath56 dependence expected for ram pressure @xcite . using their model ,",
    "the gas density , wind velocity , and ram pressure at the distance of m82 cap are estimated as 4 @xmath11 10@xmath57 @xmath25 , 5600 km s@xmath4 , and 2.1 @xmath11 10@xmath58 dyne @xmath15 , respectively . since the observed electron density is 1.0 @xmath25 at the knot h - c , the thermal pressure of ionized gas is calculated as @xmath59 dyne @xmath15 with the assumption of @xmath60 k. this indicates that the model ram pressure and the observed thermal pressure are well balanced , and the observed pressure follows @xmath56 law even at the distance of the m82 cap , 11.6 kpc ( figure [ fig : pressure - profile ] ) . furthermore , given that some of the shock motion is expected to generate local turbulent motions of the same order @xcite , the measured narrow emission line widths ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 fwhm , @xcite ) are consistent with a slow shock .",
    "therefore , it is quite likely that the cap clouds are ionized by a slow shock produced by the m82 superwind .",
    "future deep observations of the m82 cap , e.g. , [ ] @xmath16300 , will enable us to directly confirm its dominant ionization source .",
    "in the case of a slow shock , the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio larger than 0.1 is to be expected @xcite , while a smaller ratio is evidence for photoionization by massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission was detected at the m82 cap @xcite .",
    "the electron density , temperature , and thermal pressure of hot gas are @xmath61 @xmath25 , 9 @xmath62 k , and 1.3 @xmath63 dyne @xmath15 , respectively , where @xmath64 is the filling factor of hot gas . however , a slow shock is not the main heating mechanism , because these can only heat to @xmath65 k. additionally , thermal pressures of ionized and hot gas are inconsistent at the m82 cap , though they are consistent at the m82 center @xcite .",
    "hence , another heating source for hot gas is required .    a reasonable explanation for the hot gas",
    "is found when considering a 2-component shock model .",
    "an cloud in isolation develops a core - halo structure where the core is dense and the halo is relatively diffuse @xcite . in this interpretation ,",
    "the x - ray emission is produced by the superwind triggering a shock in the diffuse gas surrounding the knots in the cap ( see @xcite ) . to produce gas with @xmath66 k",
    "requires a fast shock whose shock velocity @xmath67 is 820 km s@xmath4 .",
    "but the 2-component shock by the same superwind can not explain the discrepancy between the thermal pressures of these gas phases",
    ".    a 2-component shock by different superwinds from the m82 starburst region may be the case for the m82 cap . in this model ,",
    "the slow shock by the present superwind ionizes the cap clouds , while hot gas observed today was produced by a fast shock driven by a past superwind outburst .",
    "what is important is that the cooling timescales of these gas phases are drastically different : @xmath68 yr and @xmath69 yr for ionized and hot gas , respectively @xcite .",
    "the history of this model is as follows : @xmath70 yrs ago , a fast shock driven by a past superwind produced hot ionized gas ; after @xmath68 yrs , the ionized gas cooled while the hot gas continued to emit x - rays , and now the slow shock ionizes the cap clouds again to produce the h@xmath0 and x - ray emission from the cap .",
    "it is undoubtedly true that the physics of superwinds is complicated .",
    "however , we are able to deduce some basic properties of the wind . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", there is a well determined series of events that lead to a superwind taking hold .",
    "we believe that the new observations support the developing paradigm .    when a critical surface density of dense molecular clouds is reached in the galaxy ,",
    "massive stars are born .",
    "these stars evolve rapidly and their strong uv radiation fields produce a warm gaseous medium that encircles the remaining molecular clouds . after a few million years , the cores of the most massive stars collapse leading to multiple supernova explosions .",
    "this huge impulse of mechanical energy heats the diffuse medium to extremely high temperatures ( @xmath71k ) where it expands to form a powerful superwind .",
    "( if the mechanical energy or uv radiative energy were entirely absorbed by the dense gas , most of the energy would simply be re - radiated as ir emission . ) the hot flowing gas entrains cooler gas from the disk with the flow ; we know this because of well defined rotation of the entrained filaments about the wind axis @xcite .",
    "the entrained gas is very clumpy because it is mostly entrained from the surviving dense clouds in the disk @xcite .",
    "m82 is engulfed by a large cloud complex and some of this material appears to be accreting onto the dwarf close to the minor axis @xcite .",
    "the cap material is almost certainly supplied by infalling gas .",
    "the cap ionization almost certainly arises from the expanding superwind interacting with infalling gas .",
    "the spatial coincidence of the h@xmath0 and x - ray emission may be explained with the model of a 2-component shock by different m82 superwinds .",
    "further constraints on the cap may come from uv absorption line spectroscopy using distant quasars as a background light source",
    ". the expected warm - hot medium should be visible in low to intermediate ionization states of c , n , o , ne and fe , even for gas in a non - equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "our new highly resolved observations show that the cap is very clumpy presumably as a consequence of the wind - cloud interaction .",
    "our expectation is that the cap will be disrupted in a shock crossing time of about @xmath72 myr .",
    "the fact that the outer cap is presently ionized by local shocks , and not by nuclear uv radiation , supports the findings of @xcite . unlike agn - driven wind filaments which are all found to be ionized by nuclear uv radiation , the starburst wind filaments are ionized by local shocks far from the nucleus .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of a ` starburst ' because the hot young stars must evolve to supernovae before the wind gets going , and therefore few remain to ionize gas clouds in the direction of the flow .",
    "we fully anticipate that future deep optical , uv and x - ray imaging and spectroscopy will reveal further details about the cap region , and in turn about the nature of the superwind in m82 .",
