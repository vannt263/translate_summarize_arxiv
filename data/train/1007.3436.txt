    "the riemann zeta function is defined as the series @xmath3 for any integer @xmath4 .",
    "three centuries ago euler found that @xmath5 , which is an irrational number .",
    "exact value of @xmath6 is still unknown though it was proved by apry in 1979 that @xmath6 was also irrational ( see @xcite ) .",
    "values of @xmath1 , when @xmath7 is even , are known and can be written in terms of bernoulli numbers .",
    "we refer the interested reader to chapter 19 of @xcite for a  perfect \" proof of the formula @xmath8    notice that @xmath1 can be written as the following multi - variable integral @xmath9 indeed , each integral is improper at both ends and since the geometric series @xmath10 converges uniformly on the interval @xmath11 we can write @xmath12 then interchange summation with integration , and then integrate @xmath13 for each @xmath14 . using the identities @xmath15 and a simple change of variables one can easily see that @xmath16 by further generalizing this idea one comes along the following , @xmath17    notice that @xmath18 is the only point in the square @xmath19\\times[0,1]$ ] , which makes the integrand @xmath20 singular .",
    "if we take another point on the graph of @xmath21 , say @xmath22 with @xmath23 , then it follows easily ( see lemma 1 below ) that @xmath24    this result motivates the following definition    for any point @xmath25 such that @xmath26 we define @xmath27    for any @xmath28 , we have @xmath29",
    ".    simply observe that by using the change of variables @xmath30 for all @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 , the jacobian equals 1 , and the integrand is unchanged .",
    "in this article we investigate @xmath1 following beukers , calabi and kolk ( see @xcite ) , who used the change of variables @xmath33 such proof of the identity @xmath34 may also be found in chapter 6 of @xcite and in papers of elkies @xcite and kalman @xcite .",
    "let us also mention here that kalman s paper , in addition to a few other proofs of the identity , contains some history of the problem together with an extensive reference list .",
    "here we will be changing variables too , but in the integrals @xmath35 and using the hyperbolic trig functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 instead of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "such a change of variables was considered independently of us by silagadze and the reader will find his results in @xcite .    *",
    "acknowledgement * : the authors would like to thank the referee who drew our attention to kalman s paper @xcite and has made a few useful suggestions that improved the exposition .",
    "first observe that the change of variables @xmath40 reduces the integrand in @xmath41 to 1 only when @xmath7 is even .",
    "the region of integration @xmath42 $ ] becomes the one - to - one image of the @xmath7-dimensional polytop ( note @xmath43 ) @xmath44.\\ ] ]    we suggest here a different change of variables that will produce an integrand of 1 for all values of @xmath7 in @xmath35 .",
    "but first we define the corresponding region .    for any point @xmath25",
    "such that @xmath26 we define @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .    the change in variables @xmath47 reduces the integrand of @xmath35 to 1 for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "it also gives a one - to - one differentiable map between the region @xmath48 and the set @xmath49 described by the following @xmath7 inequalities : @xmath50    the inequalities for @xmath51 follow trivially from the corresponding inequalities @xmath52 and the facts that @xmath53 and @xmath54 is increasing everywhere .",
    "injectivity and smoothness of the map may be proven by writing down formulas , which express each @xmath55 in terms of all @xmath56 .",
    "for example , here are the corresponding formulas for the set @xmath57 : @xmath58    the jacobian is the determinant of the matrix @xmath59    to compute this determinant we observe that the first column expansion reduces the computation to two determinants of the upper and lower triangular matrices .",
    "this results in the formula , where the first term comes from the upper triangular matrix and the second from the lower triangular matrix ( recall that @xmath43 ) :    @xmath60    when using the above change in variables the denominator of the integrand @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 , which we just proved to be the jacobian .",
    "we begin with @xmath0 , which is a rational multiple of @xmath63 .",
    "lemma 1 implies that it s enough to compute @xmath64    we now preform the following change in variables @xmath65 as we proved above , our integrand reduces to 1 and all we must do is worry about the limits . if @xmath66 then clearly @xmath67 , the same is true for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . if @xmath70 then @xmath71 so @xmath72 and if @xmath73 then @xmath74 so @xmath75 thus describing our region of integration ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we then write the integral @xmath76 as follows @xmath77        @xmath78    if we let @xmath79 then @xmath80 .",
    "therefore @xmath81 since @xmath82 is concave up , we can take area of the rectangle with vertices at @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 as an overestimate of the integral , that is @xmath86 then by applying lhospital s rule one can deduce @xmath87    now , since @xmath88 , @xmath89 , we conclude that @xmath90 , and therefore we have @xmath91 since @xmath92 and @xmath93 we get @xmath94 which , after taking the limit as @xmath95 gives @xmath96    using integration by parts @xmath97 and @xmath98 one obtains the formula @xmath99 by examining the limits of the first half of the formula as x goes to 0 and @xmath100 we are left with only the integral @xmath101 by applying the change in variables @xmath102 our formula becomes @xmath103    now we use the method of differentiation under the integral sign and consider the function @xmath104 one should consider the function @xmath105 at the points @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 is clearly the integral we are trying to find and @xmath109 is 0 .",
    "thus by differentiating under the integral with respect to alpha , plus some algebra we obtain @xmath110 then by preforming the change in variables @xmath111 the integral becomes @xmath112 which is simply @xmath113    since we took the derivative with respect to @xmath114 we must take the integral with respect to alpha so we have @xmath115 which , as stated above is our goal .",
    "so @xmath116 and hence @xmath117 .",
    "one could try to use similar approach to compute @xmath119 , however the computations become a bit long .",
    "instead , we present an elementary proof of the following theorem , which generalizes our formula for @xmath0 from the previous section .          applying the substitution @xmath123 to the integral @xmath124",
    "gives @xmath125 since the integral is improper at both ends and the geometric series @xmath126 converges uniformly on the interval @xmath127 , the last integral equals @xmath128"
