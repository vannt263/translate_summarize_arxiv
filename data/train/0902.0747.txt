    "richard bentley , england s leading 17th century classicist essentially posed the spatial part of this question to his friend isaac newton .",
    "their ensuing letters may be found today in the library of trinity college , cambridge , and are discussed in some detail elsewhere @xcite , along with the subject s subsequent history .",
    "briefly , newton surmised that if the universe were finite the objects would eventually all fall together into one large cluster .",
    "but if the universe were infinite , they `` could never convene into one mass ; but some of it would convene into one mass and some into another , so as to make an infinite number of great masses , scattered at great distances from one to another throughout all that infinite space . '' and there the question rested for almost 300 years .",
    "today we restate this question by replacing `` finite '' and `` infinite '' by `` static '' and `` expanding '' and talking about galaxies instead of stars .",
    "the cosmological many - body problem appears to be a major component of the clustering of galaxies , although a detailed analysis of the astronomical observations also involves the roles of dark matter , galaxy formation and evolution , and perhaps dark energy .",
    "early investigations of the gravitational many - body problem used a fluid approach when @xcite explored the stability of a self - gravitating gas . in the cosmological problem ,",
    "the fundamental particles are usually galaxies .",
    "jeans results described gravitational collapse , and gave a timescale , proportional to @xmath0 , for the collapse .",
    "jeans solutions were developed for a static universe , since expansion had not been discovered .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a static universe is unstable and a slight perturbation will cause it either to start expanding or collapsing .",
    "hubble s @xcite discovery of expansion and the possible existence of dark energy @xcite provide a framework for the expanding universe and suggest that the universe will continue expanding so that structure formation and growth may eventually cease .",
    "this leads to interesting properties that we will explore below .",
    "in addition to expansion , the other major discovery that simplifies the cosmological many - body problem is that the two - point correlation function of galaxies , @xmath1 , has a power law form @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this two - point galaxy correlation function is defined by the relation @xmath3 for a statistically homogenous system of average number density @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the conditional probability given a galaxy in an infinitesimal volume at an arbitrary coordinate origin , that there is another galaxy at a distance @xmath6 .",
    "conventionally , spherical volumes are used although this can easily be generalized to volumes of arbitrary shape which provide further information .",
    "two - point correlation functions therefore represent an excess over a random poisson probability . in our case",
    "this excess is caused by the galaxies mutual attraction .",
    "for positive @xmath7 , @xmath1 decreases significantly at large @xmath6 .",
    "observationally there is a correlation length , @xmath8 , beyond which the correlation function decreases even faster than a power law , and may be neglected . therefore over sufficiently large scales , the spatial distribution of galaxies is uncorrelated , and has a poisson distribution , modified by its clustering on smaller scales .",
    "modern surveys such as the 2dfgrs@xcite have shown that @xmath9 with @xmath10 mpc and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hubble constant .",
    "amusingly , the exponent and amplitude in equation ( [ 1-eq1a ] ) are very close to those found in totsuji and kihara s analysis of the lick survey , 40 years ago .",
    "this result implies that on sufficiently large scales , the average density and the gravitational mean field is constant and isotropic .",
    "the resultant net force on a galaxy from the distant universe is negligible . on local scales ,",
    "galaxies are subject to the long range effects of gravity from their neighbours within @xmath8 .    for an expanding universe",
    ", @xcite showed that the expansion of the universe cancels the effect of the long range gravitational field for distances greater than @xmath13 .",
    "this result is valid for einstein - friedmann models and for models that incorporate a cosmological constant , including @xmath14cdm cosmology . because of expansion",
    ", the infinite range gravitational force has a finite effective range .",
    "large - scale structures that form in the universe may be essentially stable as long as the universe is statistically homogenous at scales larger than @xmath13 .",
    "these results simplify the problem .",
    "since the expansion of the universe effectively cancels the long range gravitational field , we can calculate the potential on a galaxy by integrating over a finite region of space instead of over the entire universe .",
    "although the problem still involves an infinite volume , the gravitational field now has a finite range and we can consider a finite sub - volume caused by this cancellation .    gravitational systems with more than two interacting particles are essentially unstable and not in equilibrium . while thermodynamics describes equilibrium systems , the cosmological case is characterised by quasi - equilibrium .",
    "this means that macroscopic quantities such as average temperature , pressure and density satisfy equilibrium relations whose variables change slowly compared with local relaxation timescales .",
    "for example , the average density of the universe(including dark matter ) is approximately @xmath15 @xcite , and an average galaxy has a mass of approximately @xmath16 .",
    "hence the dynamical timescale of the universe is @xmath17 gyr , and there are about @xmath18 galaxies per cubic megaparsec .",
    "the average peculiar velocity of a galaxy is @xmath19 km s@xmath20 , or 1 mpc gyr@xmath20 .",
    "therefore a cube with sides on the order of @xmath13 will have about 3000 galaxies , and the time for a galaxy to cross the cube is about 20 gyr , or 1.5 times the age of the universe .",
    "local timescales are much shorter .",
    "a typical cluster similar to our local group of galaxies has a density(including dark matter ) @xmath21 .",
    "this is @xmath22 times greater than @xmath23 , and hence the local group has a dynamical timescale @xmath24 gyr .",
    "rich clusters which are much denser than the local group will have correspondingly shorter dynamical timescales .",
    "most clusters have an average diameter of @xmath25 mpc , and hence the time taken to cross from one end to another is on the order of @xmath26 gyr .",
    "these numbers mean that `` microscopic '' perturbations on local scales will relax significantly faster than the `` macroscopic '' scale of a cube of side @xmath13 , so that the system generally evolves from one equilibrium state to another in quasi - equilibrium .",
    "the preceding considerations frame the problem .",
    "we have a gravitational field with an effective range @xmath13 in a system that is in quasi - equilibrium for which we need the counts - in - cells distribution @xmath27 , _ i.e. _ the probability that a given cell located randomly in space contains @xmath28 galaxies .",
    "thermodynamics and statistical mechanics provide two approaches to this problem .",
    "the thermodynamic solution was the first to be investigated @xcite and gives @xmath29^{n-1}e^{-(\\overline{n}(1-b)+nb)}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the average number of galaxies in a cell , and @xmath31 is a clustering parameter equal to the ratio between the correlation potential energy and twice the kinetic energy : @xmath32 with @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the kinetic temperature of the system with kinetic energy @xmath35 ( taking the boltzmann constant = 1 ) , and @xmath36 is the average number of galaxies per unit volume where @xmath37 is the cell volume .",
    "the distribution given by equation ( [ 1-eq2 ] ) describes the clustering of galaxies in quasi - equilibrium , and hence is known as the gravitational quasi - equilibrium distribution(gqed ) .",
    "the galaxy spatial distribution function @xmath27 is a simple but powerful statistic which characterises the locations of galaxies in space .",
    "it includes statistical information on voids and other underdense regions , on clusters of all shapes and sizes , on the probability of finding an arbitrary number of neighbours around randomly located positions , on counts of galaxies in cells of arbitrary shapes and sizes randomly located , and on galaxy correlation functions of all orders .",
    "these are just some of its representations @xcite .",
    "moreover it is also closely related to the distribution function of the peculiar velocities of galaxies around the hubble flow @xcite .    while the form of @xmath31 in the second equality of equation ( [ 1-eq3 ] ) was originally taken as an ansatz by @xcite , a physical reason for the form",
    "was given by @xcite using constraints from thermodynamics and the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "writing the correlation potential energy in terms of the two - point correlation function gives @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of an individual galaxy .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ 1-eq4 ] ) indicates that @xmath31 depends on the shape and size of the cell , often taken to be spherical for simplicity .",
    "more generally , the shape of a cell affects the correlation potential energy so that@xcite @xmath40      the statistical mechanical approach to this problem was originated by @xcite who treated the cells as a grand canonical ensemble with the universe as an energy and particle reservoir and the galaxies as particles in the ensemble .",
    "the statistical mechanical results are essentially the same as those in the thermodynamic analysis of point particles , but here we use their generalization to extended particles . in this section",
    "we consider the simplest case with the following assumptions :    * galaxies behave like point masses and the two - galaxy interaction potential is @xmath41 .",
    "this will be generalised to include a softening parameter , @xmath42 , at small scales in equation ( [ 2-eq1 ] ) .",
    "but since the lower limits of the integrals in equations ( [ 1-eq5])-([1-eq6a ] ) converge uniformly in the limit @xmath43 , we first use this limit to give the simple formulae in equations ( [ 1-eq7])-([1-eq13 ] ) of the original thermodynamic results . *",
    "only 2-body interactions are considered as the dominant type of interactions .",
    "* @xmath44 is small .",
    "all three assumptions can be relaxed and we will discuss the resulting modifications in section [ s2-mod ] .    in order to compute the partition function , we note that since expansion cancels the long range mean - field force the integral over physical space has a finite cutoff and the integral @xmath45 d^{3}\\mathbf{r } = \\int_{0}^{r_{1 } } \\exp\\left[\\frac{g m^{2}}{|\\mathbf{r}| t } \\right ] d^{3}\\mathbf{r}\\ ] ] for a galaxy mass potential has no singularities if the third assumption above holds .    in order to compute the partition function ,",
    "we start with the normalised phase space integral @xmath46 d^{3n}\\mathbf{p } d^{3n } \\mathbf{r } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{n!}\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m t}{\\lambda^{2}}\\right)^{3n/2 } q_{n}(t , v)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 a normalisation constant and @xmath37 the volume of the ensemble . from the observation that most gravitational interactions are dominated by two - body interactions , and by taking the first order expansion of the exponential , the potential energy term of the configuration integral @xmath47 becomes @xmath48 d^{3n } \\mathbf{r } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\int\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n}\\exp\\left[-\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{ij})t^{-1}\\right ] d^{3n } \\mathbf{r } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & \\int\\prod_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n}\\left[1+\\frac{g m^{2}}{t|\\mathbf{r}_{ij}|}\\right ] d^{3n } \\mathbf{r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that galaxies at large distances behave like point masses(although their finite extent is important in close interactions and mergers ) , that 2-body interactions dominate , and that @xmath49 is small .",
    "this gives the partition function for a canonical ensemble , the helmholtz free energy , and the corresponding thermodynamic variables for entropy , pressure , internal energy and chemical potential : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    in these derivations the functional form of @xmath31 occurs naturally as @xmath56 comparing the coefficients of equations ( [ 1-eq8 ] ) and ( [ 1-eq3 ] ) , we see that @xmath57 which quantitatively relates the correlation potential energy to the mass of an individual galaxy and confirms the original ansatz in equation ( [ 1-eq3 ] ) .",
    "the distribution function is obtained by summing over all energy states for given @xmath28 : @xmath58 by using equations ( [ 1-eq7])-([1-eq7d ] ) and the relation between the grand canonical partition function @xmath59 and the pressure equation of state , we then again obtain the distribution function given by equation ( [ 1-eq2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ 1-fig1 ] illustrates the counts in cells distribution for different values of @xmath31 . for @xmath60",
    ", there is no interaction and equation ( [ 1-eq2 ] ) becomes a poisson distribution .    ) for @xmath61      the gqed also contains a consistent distribution function for the peculiar velocities of galaxies . since the partition function separates into kinetic and potential energy factors , the phase space distribution is separable such that @xcite @xmath62    to relate the counts - in - cells distribution to the peculiar velocity distribution , we need a relation between the number density @xmath28 and the velocity @xmath63 .",
    "this arises from the proportionality between the fluctuations in potential energy ( due to correlations ) over a given volume and the local kinetic energy fluctuations : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is a constant of proportionality such that @xmath66 , @xmath63 is the peculiar velocity of a galaxy , and @xmath6 is the separation between two galaxies @xcite .    with the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath63 in equation ( [ 1-eq11b ] ) , the distribution in equation ( [ 1-eq2 ] ) can be transformed to a distribution in @xmath63 @xcite : @xmath67^{\\alpha v^{2}-1 } e^{-\\left(\\alpha\\beta(1-b ) + \\alpha b v^{2}\\right ) } v dv\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the standard gamma function , and averages are taken over the grand canonical ensemble .",

    "we can generally write the velocity as a component parallel to our line of sight and a component perpendicular to our line of sight such that @xmath73 . then to obtain a form of the velocity distribution directly comparable with observations ,",

    "various modifications and extensions exist for the gqed .",
    "the simplest case involves a modification of the potential of a galaxy so that instead of treating galaxies as point masses , galaxies are treated as extended objects with a potential having the form @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath42 is a softening parameter related to the radius of a galaxy .",
    "such a modified potential is commonly used in @xmath28-body simulations to model extended galaxies possibly with dark matter halos , and to avoid the singularity in the point mass potential when the separation between galaxies is small .",
    "the result of such a softening parameter is a modification @xmath31 to @xmath76 such that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a term that depends on the interaction potential between a pair of galaxies . for @xmath79 @xmath80    in the case of a point mass , @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "so the partition function and its consequent thermodynamic properties converge to the solution for a point mass potential .",

    "it can then be shown that @xmath86 depends on the form of @xmath85 such that @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "this modification of the potential will only affect @xmath89 .",

    "the gqed has a number of properties that are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we summarise some of them here .",
    "for the simplest case , the two - point correlation function enters @xmath27 through ( [ 1-eq4a ] ) since @xmath31 depends on the volume integral of @xmath125 .",
    "however , in general the form of the gqed also contains information about the volume integrals of all the correlation functions where the average volume integral is defined as @xmath126 for the general @xmath28-point correlation function , @xcite derived a relation between @xmath127 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the general form for @xmath128",
    "is @xmath129 for @xmath130 , 2 and 3 this gives @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 average moments of other quantities , including the thermodynamic variables , have also been derived .      from the internal energy given by equation ( [ 1-eq7c ] ) ,",
    "using equation ( [ 1-eq3 ] ) the specific heat per galaxy at constant volume is @xmath134 which at @xmath60 , is @xmath135 representing the monatomic ideal gas .",
    "as galaxies cluster , binaries start to dominate and @xmath136 reaches its maximum of @xmath137 at @xmath138 . at a critical value of @xmath139 such that @xmath140 @xmath141 .",
    "as @xmath31 increases beyond @xmath139 , @xmath142 decreases until @xmath136 reaches @xmath143 at @xmath144 representing the specific heat of a fully virialized cluster .",
    "the transition from positive to negative specific heat , illustrated in figure [ 3-fig1 ] , occurs at a rather high value of @xmath31 , and does not involve a discontinuity , unlike some laboratory systems .     from equation ( [ 3-eq1 ] ) . ]",
    "while negative specific heat is frequently encountered in the gravitational context , the system we are discussing is nominally a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "grand canonical ensembles can only have positive specific heat ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 141.12 ) .",
    "however for a microcanonical ensemble , the specific heat can be negative@xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) .    to resolve this `` paradox '' , we consider clustering for increasing @xmath31 . as @xmath31 increases , galaxies become increasingly clustered and large voids are created .",
    "these voids have the effect of insulating clusters from the energy and galaxy reservoir that is the rest of the universe .",
    "the net effect is that the universe breaks up into a collection of galaxy clusters .",
    "each cluster is a microcanonical ensemble that does not exchange significant energy or galaxies with the rest of the universe .",
    "the measured value of @xmath31 for the local universe of redshifts @xmath145 is about 0.86 for large @xmath146 angular cells @xcite which indicates that @xmath147 and suggests that clustering is fairly advanced in the local universe .",
    "the average matter density(including dark matter ) of the universe is @xmath148mpc @xmath149 @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the mass and radius of a typical rich cluster are about @xmath150 and 2 mpc , making it approximately 1000 times denser than the average universe . to find a lower bound to the inter - cluster spacing , consider a simple model in which rich clusters are each surrounded by a void where no galaxies exist",
    ". then each void would be approximately a sphere that would contain roughly @xmath151 if the matter were initially distributed uniformly throughout the universe .",
    "the radius of such a sphere is approximately 19 mpc , which suggests that the average massive cluster separation is at least 19 mpc .",
    "for an average galaxy with a peculiar velocity of about 1000 km / s to move from one cluster to another over a distance of 19 mpc would require about 19 gyr , which is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "the long transit times involved suggest that such clusters are no longer likely to exchange galaxies . at separations of 19 mpc ,",
    "the interaction potential energy of a pair of galaxies of @xmath152 each is approximately 4 orders of magnitude lower than the kinetic energy of a single galaxy with a peculiar velocity of 1000 km / s which indicates that at large values of @xmath31 , clusters would exchange energy more effectively by exchanging galaxies rather than by long range gravitational interactions . but galaxy exchange now takes too long . hence at @xmath153 , clusters are approximately microcanonical ensembles that are likely to be virialized@xcite and have a negative heat capacity .",
    "when most galaxies are bound to a cluster in the case of large @xmath31 , the total heat capacity is negative , and hence the specific heat per galaxy is negative .    to see this , we can use the multiplicity function derived from equation ( [ 1-eq2 ] ) which gives the probability that a physical cluster contains @xmath28 galaxies ( see @xcite , equation 28.97 ) : @xmath154 which is a truncated borel distribution . from equation([3-eq1 ] ) , the total heat capacity of these clusters is therefore @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the total number of clusters having an average number @xmath30 of galaxies per cluster",
    ". the multiplicity function sums to unity and we can divide the total heat capacity by @xmath157 to obtain the average specific heat of the collection of clusters , each of which is a microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this gives the same result as equation ( [ 3-eq1 ] ) , so the effective specific heat of this ensemble also becomes negative for @xmath158 in equation ( [ 3-eq2 ] ) .    when @xmath159 , @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "the void probability goes to 1 and all galaxies will be bound to a single cluster that can be represented as an isothermal sphere@xcite . in that limit , the energy and galaxy reservoir is effectively depleted , and the entire system effectively becomes a single microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this transition , as @xmath31 increases , from a single grand canonical ensemble where the average cluster has a positive specific heat per galaxy through a collection of microcanonical ensembles with negative specific heat per galaxy to a single virialized microcanonical ensemble is an effect of increasing gravitational inhomogeneity .",
    "it is rather remarkable that equation ( [ 3-eq1 ] ) can describe this entire ensemble transition in a smooth manner .",
    "perhaps the reason is that properties of the system for @xmath158 are essentially determined by its properties for @xmath162 .",
    "galaxies are known to interact and merge with each other . over time",
    ", we can expect the average number of galaxies in a given comoving volume to decrease due to mergers , and hence galaxy mergers will change the distribution of galaxies .",
    "we can classify galaxy mergers by the masses of the progenitors @xmath114 and @xmath163 .",
    "minor mergers are mergers where one galaxy is much less massive than another galaxy such that @xmath164 or @xmath165 . in such mergers",
    ", the resulting galaxy will have a position that is close to the centre of mass of the larger of the two galaxies and the only change to the distribution is the reduction of the number of low mass galaxies .",
    "the other class of mergers are major mergers where both progenitors are of comparable mass such that @xmath166 , and the position of the resulting galaxy is approximately at the midpoint between the two .",
    "major mergers will change the spatial distribution of galaxies more drastically .",
    "the average number density @xmath30 decreases with time and the average mass of each galaxy increases with time .",
    "this affects the rate at which @xmath31 changes .    to follow the change in the distribution of galaxies due to mergers",
    ", we consider the distribution of nearest neighbour galaxy pairs whose members are separated by a distance @xmath167 .",
    "we denote the separation between the midpoints of two such pairs by @xmath168 .",
    "hence the interaction between two galaxy pairs , each with separations @xmath169 and @xmath170 , is given by @xmath171 where the term in brackets can be viewed as a modification to the point mass potential . by averaging over possible values of @xmath172 and @xmath173",
    ", we can use equation ( [ 3-eq6 ] ) to define a modification @xmath174 to the potential where @xmath175 is the separation between two pairs . from section [ s2-mod ] ,",
    "the modification due to such a potential will enter into the form of @xmath176 and hence the resulting distribution will also follow the gqed . by assuming that all galaxies will eventually merge",
    ", we note that when all galaxies have merged once , the spatial distribution of the resulting galaxies also follows the gqed .",
