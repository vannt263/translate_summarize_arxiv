    "in quantum chaos one is primarily interested in statistical properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of quantum hamiltonians whose classical limits generate chaotic dynamics . in this context",
    "the eigenvalue statistics on the scale of the mean level spacing are expected to be described by random matrix theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture has since found overwhelming confirmation , mostly based on numerical calculations of eigenvalues in many systems . for the corresponding eigenvectors",
    "one also expects a random behaviour , and various tools to measure this have been invented . among them",
    "one finds one of the few results in quantum chaos for which a mathematical proof is available : if a classical system is ergodic , its quantum mechanical counterpart is quantum ergodic . by",
    "this one understands a semiclassical convergence of almost all phase - space lifts of eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( e.g. , their wigner- and husimitransforms ) towards equidistribution with respect to microcanonical ( i.e.  liouville ) measure .",
    "one thus has obtained a realisation of the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for classically ergodic systems .",
    "quantum ergodicity was first established for the free motion of a particle on a compact riemannian manifold , where the quantum dynamics is generated by minus the laplace - beltrami operator on that manifold .",
    "this goes back to shnirelman @xcite , and the first complete proofs are due to zelditch @xcite and colin de verdire @xcite . in the systems considered by these authors",
    "the semiclassical limit is actually realised as a high - energy limit .",
    "however , for schrdinger operators involving a potential and possibly also a magnetic field the semiclassical limit can in general only be performed in terms of @xmath0 . in this setting quantum ergodicity",
    "was first proven by helffer , martinez , and robert @xcite .",
    "all of the work mentioned so far exclusively dealt with the dynamics of point particles without internal degrees of freedom ; in particular no spin was involved . on the level of the quantum hamiltonians @xmath1 that were taken into account ,",
    "this is reflected in the fact that @xmath1 appears as a ( weyl- ) quantisation of a scalar symbol .",
    "the only degrees of freedom appearing are therefore those that possess a direct classical analogue .",
    "these are in fact the translational degrees of freedom , which on the classical side yield as a phase space a smooth symplectic manifold that in typical cases is the cotangent bundle over the configuration manifold . in this setting internal degrees of freedom",
    "would appear through the fact that the quantum mechanical observables are quantisations of matrix valued symbols , such that the vector spaces these matrices operate on represent the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "in quantum mechanics internal degrees of freedom often arise due to the presence of symmetries .",
    "since in general symmetries have to be implemented through ( anti- ) unitary representations of the respective symmetry groups on the hilbert space of state vectors , representations of dimensions exceeding one introduce discrete degrees of freedom .",
    "it then can happen that these additional degrees of freedom do not possess classical analogues .",
    "a prominent example of this phenomenon is provided by the spin of a particle , which arises through the space - time symmetries that either form the lorentz group ( in a relativistic theory ) , or the galilei group ( in a non - relativistic theory ) .",
    "both these symmetry groups contain the proper rotations , i.e.  @xmath2 , as a subgroup . through the unitary projective representations of the lorentz or galilei group , respectively , which implement the space - time symmetries in the quantum theory , one therefore introduces the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath3 , i.e.  spin . on the classical side the rotation group",
    ", however , remains to be @xmath2 , which then enters in terms of spatial angular momentum .",
    "there exists , however , no direct classical analogue of spin . coming back now to the problem of quantum ergodicity for particles with spin , there immediately arises the question for a criterion to be imposed on the classical system in order to ensure that the eigenfunctions of the quantum hamiltonian behave quantum ergodically in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we recall that in the case without spin such a criterion was given by the ergodicity of the dynamics on the classical phase space with respect to liouville measure .",
    "one would now expect that the presence of additional , internal degrees of freedom requires an extended criterion in order that quantum ergodicity holds .",
    "it is the primary goal of the present work to elaborate on this question in some detail for the case of a non - relativistic quantum particle with spin 1/2 .",
    "our proof of quantum ergodicity in this context generalises the methods of @xcite to the situation of weyl operators with @xmath4-matrix valued symbols .",
    "this requires two essential ingredients .",
    "the first one is an egorov theorem , which relates the semiclassical limit of the quantum mechanical time evolution of an observable to the classical time evolution of the corresponding classical observable .",
    "the second input required is a szeg limit formula , which expresses the semiclassical limit of averaged expectation values of observables in eigenstates of the hamiltonian in terms of a classical microcanonical average . in the course of the subsequent proof of quantum ergodicity we primarily rely on the method developed in @xcite , which provides a considerable simplification over the original proofs given in @xcite .",
    "already the egorov property that one encounters for systems with spin hints at the construction that yields the ` classical ' criterion for quantum ergodicity that we seek for .",
    "it leads us to consider an @xmath5-extension of the hamiltonian flow that arises from the classical limit of the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "the thus extended flow is defined on a product phase space that consists of two parts : the translational part is the hypersurface of fixed energy in the classical phase space , whereas the spin part is given by the group manifold of @xmath5 . the translational part of the combined dynamics is then provided by the hamiltonian flow .",
    "the latter also drives the spin dynamics that takes place on @xmath5 and consists of a left multiplication by a spin transport matrix , which propagates the spin degrees of freedom along the trajectories of the hamiltonian flow .",
    "our main result , stated in theorem [ qe ] , then is that ergodicity of the combined flow is a sufficient criterion for quantum ergodicity .",
    "at this point we remark that the problem of quantum ergodicity for quantisations of matrix valued symbols was already considered in @xcite as an example for the general theory of quantum ergodicity of @xmath6 dynamical systems .",
    "there it was , however , overlooked that in the relevant egorov theorem , apart from a transport by the hamiltonian flow , the principal symbol of an observable is also conjugated with the spin transport matrices .",
    "as a consequence , the result stated in @xcite is hence incorrect , to the extent that ergodicity of the hamiltonian flow alone is insufficient to guarantee quantum ergodicity . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we give an example that illustrates this fact .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review some background on @xmath7-pseudodifferential calculus and define the type of hamiltonians and observables that will be considered in the sequel .",
    "the two major ingredients required for quantum ergodicity , namely the egorov property and the szeg limit formula , are developed in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "our main result , quantum ergodicity for pauli hamiltonians with spin 1/2 , is then proven in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] we discuss the consequences of quantum ergodicity for wigner- and husimitransforms of eigenfunctions and , furthermore , give an example that illustrates why ergodicity of the hamiltonian flow alone is not a sufficient criterion for quantum ergodicity .",
    "in non - relativistic quantum mechanics the dynamics of a particle with spin @xmath8 is governed by the pauli equation @xmath9 with the quantum hamiltonian @xmath10 acting as a self - adjoint operator on a suitable domain in the hilbert space @xmath11 . here",

    "the coupling of the spin degrees of freedom to the translational ones is provided by the operators @xmath23 , which are suitable quantisations of functions @xmath24 on phase space .",
    "the latter can , e.g. , describe a coupling to an external magnetic field , @xmath25 , or a spin - orbit coupling @xmath26 .    here , and in the following , we choose all quantum mechanical observables to be weyl quantisations of matrix valued symbols . in general this",

    "one therefore has to combine the classical dynamics of the translational degrees of freedom and the spin dynamics in a suitable way , and then one demands ergodic properties of the combined dynamics . in order to achieve this",
    "we employ the same construction as in @xcite and hence introduce the product phase space @xmath233 the combined flow @xmath234 is then defined as an @xmath5-extension of the hamiltonian flow @xmath121 on @xmath171 , i.e.  for @xmath235 and @xmath236 we set @xmath237 the initial condition @xmath238 is obviously fulfilled , and @xmath239 follows from the composition law @xmath240 that derives from the spin transport equation ( [ spintrans ] ) . in ergodic theory such a combined dynamics is also known as a skew product ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on @xmath241 the product measure @xmath242 consisting of the liouville measure @xmath176 on @xmath171 and the normalised haar measure @xmath243 on @xmath5 is introduced .",
    "this measure is normalised and invariant under the flow @xmath244 , since @xmath176 is normalised and invariant under @xmath121 and @xmath243 is both left and right invariant .",
    "ergodicity of @xmath244 on @xmath241 with respect to @xmath245 then means that for @xmath246 @xmath247 holds for @xmath245-almost all @xmath248 .",
    "in particular , if one chooses @xmath249 to be independent of @xmath250 , then ( [ yergodic ] ) reduces to the condition ( [ phiergodic ] ) , so that the ergodicity of the extended flow @xmath244 on @xmath241 implies the ergodicity of the flow @xmath121 on the base manifold @xmath171 .",
    "our main result now states the effect of the ergodicity of @xmath244 on the semiclassical asymptotics of eigenfunctions of @xmath88 .",
    "[ qe ] let @xmath88 be a quantum hamiltonian with symbol @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , and principal symbol @xmath251 , which fulfills the conditions 1.4 .  of section [ sec2 ] and , furthermore , satisfies @xmath252 then , under the condition that @xmath244 is ergodic on @xmath241 with respect to @xmath245 , in every sequence @xmath253 of orthonormal eigenfunctions of @xmath88 there exists a subsequence @xmath254 of density one , i.e. @xmath255 such that for every quantum observable @xmath104 with hermitian symbol @xmath182 and principal symbol @xmath183 @xmath256 moreover , the subsequence @xmath257 can be chosen independent of the observable @xmath104 .",
    "an application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality on the right - hand side of ( [ s2withbt ] ) yields an upper bound for the quantity ( [ eq : s2_defn ] ) that reads @xmath258 in order to determine the limit as @xmath0 of ( [ s2bound ] ) one can now apply proposition [ szegoe ] , which gives @xmath259 quantum ergodicity then follows , if the bound on the right - hand side can be shown to vanish .",
    "this will indeed be possible in the limit @xmath260 . in order to achieve this",
    "we first employ the ergodicity of @xmath244 in that we choose @xmath261 in the relation ( [ yergodic ] ) , and thus find @xmath262 for @xmath176-almost all @xmath178 and @xmath243-almost all @xmath236 . in terms of the principal symbol ( [ eq : aux_op_ps ] ) of the auxiliary operator @xmath263",
    "this means @xmath264 our next goal is to calculate the right - hand side of ( [ princbtlim ] ) . to this end",
    "we represent the hermitian @xmath4 matrix @xmath265 as a linear combination of @xmath266 and the pauli matrices @xmath267 , i.e.   @xmath268 , where @xmath269 .",
    "we then recall that for every @xmath236 the adjoint map @xmath270 is defined as @xmath271 .",
    "thus , @xmath272 can be expanded in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath267 such that @xmath273 .",
    "the map @xmath274 that results in this way can be identified as the universal ( twofold ) covering of @xmath2 by @xmath5 .",
    "therefore @xmath275 we now show that the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ detbtrep ] ) vanishes . to this end",
    "we multiply the integral over @xmath5 , which yields a @xmath276 matrix , with an arbitrary orthogonal matrix @xmath277 from the left .",
    "we then exploit the fact that there exists @xmath278 such that @xmath279 , together with the left invariance of the haar measure , in order to conclude that @xmath280 since hence the @xmath276 matrix represented by the integral over @xmath5 is invariant under left multiplication by an arbitrary element of @xmath2 , it must be the zero matrix . therefore , the right - hand side of ( [ princbtlim ] ) vanishes .",
    "we now choose some @xmath236 such that ( [ yergcon ] ) holds and therefore obtain that @xmath281 holds for @xmath176-almost all @xmath178 .",
    "thus , after an integration over @xmath171 , this together with ( [ trsquare ] ) implies that @xmath282 according to a standard argument in the proof of quantum ergodicity for scalar hamiltonians , see @xcite , the vanishing of @xmath283 in the semiclassical limit implies the existence of a density - one subsequence @xmath284 such that ( [ qe ] ) holds .",
    "another standard , diagonal construction then ensures that a subsequence can be chosen that is independent of the observable , see @xcite .",
    "in the case of scalar hamiltonians quantum ergodicity is often interpreted in terms of wigner- or husimitransforms of eigenfunctions . in this context one",
    "concludes that along a subsequence of density one the wigner- or husimitransforms of eigenfunctions of a quantum ergodic hamiltonian weakly converge , as distributions or measures , respectively , to liouville measure .",
    "thus the lifts of eigenfunctions to phase space become equidistributed on the hypersurface @xmath171 of energy @xmath170 . in the present situation an analogous interpretation first requires to introduce matrix valued wigner- and husimitransforms . in general , the wignertransform of @xmath285 is given by @xmath286({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) = \\int_{{{\\mathbb r}}^d}{\\text{e}}^{-\\frac{{\\text{i}}}{\\hbar}{\\boldsymbol{p}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{y } } } \\,\\overline{\\psi}\\bigl ( { \\boldsymbol{x}}-\\frac{1}{2}{\\boldsymbol{y}}\\bigr)\\otimes\\psi \\bigl ( { \\boldsymbol{x}}+\\frac{1}{2}{\\boldsymbol{y}}\\bigr ) \\ { \\text{d}}y \\ .\\ ] ] then expectation values of observables @xmath104 with symbols @xmath107 in states described by @xmath287 read @xmath288({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})\\,b({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) \\bigr)\\   { \\text{d}}p\\,{\\text{d}}x \\ .\\ ] ] in order to convert the statement of theorem [ qe ] into one about the matrix components of wignertransforms we introduce the special observables @xmath289 with symbols @xmath290 , where @xmath291 is a real valued function on phase space that is independent of @xmath7 , and the four constant matrices @xmath292 are defined by @xmath293 although the off - diagonal symbols @xmath294 and @xmath295 are non - hermitian , theorem [ qe ] can be applied to all of the observables @xmath289 in an obvious manner . together with the relation ( [ expectwig ] ) this then reveals that along the subsequence @xmath257 of density one specified in the theorem the matrix components of the wignertransforms of the eigenfunctions weakly converge , as distributions on @xmath296 , to either liouville measure or to zero . more specifically , @xmath297 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{vol}{\\omega}_e}\\,{\\delta}\\bigl ( h_{0,s}-e \\bigr)\\,{\\mathmybb{1}}_2\\ ] ] component - wise in @xmath298",
    ". in particular , the semiclassical limit of the wignerdistributions is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix .",
    "this means that the ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' components become identical and equidistributed over the hypersurface of energy @xmath170 in phase space .",
    "moreover , there occurs no mixture between ` spin up ' and ` spin down ' components , which can also be seen on the right - hand side of ( [ qe ] ) since there only the diagonal elements of the principal symbol @xmath183 contribute .    upon introducing matrix valued husimitransforms through @xmath299({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) = \\frac{1}{(\\pi\\hbar)^d}\\int_{{{\\mathbb r}}^d}\\int_{{{\\mathbb r}}^d }   w[\\psi]({\\boldsymbol{q}},{\\boldsymbol{y}})\\,{\\text{e}}^{-\\frac{1}{\\hbar}(({\\boldsymbol{p}}-{\\boldsymbol{q}})^2+({\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{y}})^2 ) } \\ { \\text{d}}q\\,{\\text{d}}y\\ , \\ ] ] one can also consider anti - wick quantisations of symbols @xmath103 .",
    "expectation values of the corresponding anti - wick operators @xmath300 then read in analogy to ( [ expectwig ] ) @xmath301({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x}})\\,b({\\boldsymbol{p}},{\\boldsymbol{x } } ) \\bigr)\\   { \\text{d}}p\\,{\\text{d}}x \\ .\\ ] ] since , moreover , for @xmath103 @xmath302 one can replace @xmath104 by @xmath300 in ( [ qe ] ) so that theorem  [ qe ] implies an analogue of ( [ wigsc ] ) , i.e.@xmath303\\ { \\text{d}}p\\,{\\text{d}}x =   \\frac{1}{2}\\,{\\mathmybb{1}}_2\\,{\\text{d}}\\mu_e \\ , \\ ] ] where the convergence has to be understood component - wise as a weak convergence of probability measures on the phase space @xmath37 .    as a further point",
    "we now want to discuss whether it is actually necessary to introduce the @xmath5-extension @xmath244 of the hamiltonian flow @xmath121 , and to require ergodicity of @xmath244 in order to obtain quantum ergodicity . to this end",
    "we provide an example showing that in general it would not suffice to demand only ergodicity of @xmath121 .",
    "let us therefore introduce a quantum hamiltonian @xmath1 of the type introduced in sections [ sec2 ] .  ",
    "[ sec4 ] .  with symbol @xmath304 where @xmath305 is one of the pauli matrices and @xmath81",
    "shall be chosen such that @xmath121 is ergodic on @xmath171 .",
    "now @xmath305 can obviously also be considered as a bounded self - adjoint operator on @xmath306 which commutes with @xmath1 ; in fact , @xmath307 is the @xmath308-th component of the spin observable .",
    "hence , one can introduce joint eigenvectors @xmath309 of @xmath1 and @xmath305 . since @xmath310 , the eigenvalues of @xmath305 are @xmath311 . introducing @xmath312 such that @xmath313 is diagonal , we can switch to eigenvectors @xmath314 such that @xmath315 the expectation values of an observable @xmath104 in these eigenvectors @xmath316 therefore read @xmath317 where @xmath318 denotes the scalar product in @xmath319 .",
    "since the subsequences of the @xmath316 s with @xmath320 and @xmath321 , respectively , are each of density one half , quantum ergodicity can not hold for general observables @xmath104 .",
    "on the other hand , the above example does not fulfill the requirements of theorem [ qe ] so that no contradiction occurs . to see this",
    "consider the spin transport equation ( [ spintrans ] ) , which in the present case reads @xmath322 and is solved by the expression @xmath323 where @xmath324 the explicit solution ( [ dsol ] ) of the spin transport equation demonstrates that , even if the flow @xmath121 on the base manifold @xmath171 is ergodic , its @xmath5-extension @xmath244 can not be ergodic on the product phase space @xmath241 .",
    "this is due to the fact that with ( [ dsol ] ) one only explores a one dimensional submanifold of the three dimensional group manifold of @xmath5 .",
