    "the nature of the ground state of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in a large perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 has attracted a lot of attention . at small filling factors , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the 2des density",
    ", @xmath5 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath6 is the electronic charge , the ground state in the absence of disorder is expected to be the wigner crystal ( wc )  @xcite .",
    "another known ground states are the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) states  @xcite .",
    "both states are induced by the electron - electron interaction .",
    "it turns out that the laughlin fqhe liquid states at @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are integers ) are particularly robust and have ground state energies which are lower than the wc state energy , at least for @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that , in an ideal 2des system , the wc should be the ground state for @xmath1 smaller than about 1/6 .",
    "however , the wc state may win as the filling deviates slightly from 1/5 .",
    "it is possible therefore to have a wc , which is reentrant around a fqhe liquid state , see fig .",
    "9 in  [ ] . this would rationalize the general current belief that the insulating phase ( ip ) observed around the @xmath0 fqhe in very high quality gaas / algaas 2dess is the signature of a wc state pinned by a disorder potential . the magnetic - field - induced wc problem in 2dess has been studied extensively since the late 1980s  @xcite .    in 2d systems along with dc measurements of the components of the magneto - resistance tensor",
    "many research groups study ac conductivity @xmath11 , which is a probeless way for investigation of the ac conductance .",
    "the rf electric field can be excited using the coplanar - wave - guide ( cpw ) technique  @xcite .",
    "this method was successfully employed for studies of the fqhe in  [ ] and other works .",
    "another probeless method is using traveling electric wave created by a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) . in connection with the integer qhe structures",
    "it was implemented in  [ ] and subsequent works ; the fqhe was studied using this method in  [ ] and [ ] .",
    "ac methods provide the information additional to the dc results . in particular , specific resonances in the ac response",
    "allow one to identify the nature of the insulating states observed at specific values of the filling factor .",
    "the microwave spectroscopy ( mws ) based on the cpw technique and the acoustic spectroscopy ( as ) based on studies of the attenuation @xmath12 and velocity _ v _ of a saw provide complementary information .",
    "mws allows studying the high - frequency response while the frequency of the excited saw is limited .",

    "( real and imaginary ) components of the complex ac conductance from simultaneous measurement of the saw attenuation @xmath12 and variation of its velocity @xmath13__v__/__v__@xmath14 versus perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "this is an obvious advantage of the as , which we employ in the present study .",
    "usually the frequency domains used in mws and as do not overlap .",
    "however , recently is was shown that the frequency windows might overlap providing a possibility for quantitative studies of ac conductance in a broad frequency domain  @xcite .    in the present work , we address the insulating phases observed in the high - quality gaas quantum wells in the vicinity of @xmath15 .",
    "these phases are ascribed to formation of a disorder - pinned wigner crystal ( wc )  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to extend studies of this region by simultaneous analysis of the real and imaginary parts of the complex ac conductance . comparing the results with the theory  @xcite",
    "we show that the behaviors of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are indeed characteristic for a pinned wc .",

    "is generated , which propagates along the surface of the piezocrystal .",
    "the piezoelectric field penetrates into the sample interacting with the charge carriers .",

    "the wc states compete with the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) states ; based on several experiments and calculations it is concluded that at @xmath0 the fqhe dominates while at @xmath1 slightly less or slightly higher the wc state wins , see , e.g. , fig .  9 from  @xcite",
    ".    the dynamic response of a weakly pinned wigner crystal at not too small frequencies is dominated by the collective excitations  @xcite where an inhomogeneously broadened absorption line ( the so - called pinning mode ) appears  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to collective vibrations of correlated segments of the wigner crystal around their equilibrium positions formed by the random pinning potential .",

    "there are modes of two types : transverse ( magnetophonons ) and longitudinal ( magnetoplasmons ) .",
    "the latters include fluctuations in electron density .",
    "an important point is that the pinning modifies both modes , and the final result depends on the strength and the correlation length , @xmath79 , of the random potential .",

    "[ fig5 ]  ( b ) and taking into account that the maximum of @xmath46 occurring at @xmath104 mhz corresponds to @xmath105 we conclude that @xmath106 mhz .",

    "these inequalities justify using the theory  @xcite for estimates .    to summarize , from simultaneous measurements of attenuation and velocity saw propagating in proximity of 2des in perpendicular magnetic fields we have calculated both real and imaginary parts of the complex ac conductance , @xmath11 .",
