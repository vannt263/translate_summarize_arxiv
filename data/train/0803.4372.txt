    "compton scattering between photons and electrons is an important process in astrophysics .",
    "if the photons are not produced at the same place where the electrons are located , we call it `` global compton scattering '' . momentum and energy of photons and electrons can be exchanged in this process and these two aspects often play an important role in determining the dynamics of the gas flow . on the galactic scale , this so - called radiative feedback mechanism now is believed to be crucial for understanding agn feedback on galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , ciotti & ostriker 2001 , 2007 ; murray et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ) . on a smaller scale ,",
    "the effect of compton scattering on the dynamics of gas flows surrounding a strongly radiating quasar has been investigated and outflow is produced as a consequence of compton heating ( e.g. , proga , ostriker & kurosawa 2008 ) . following the earlier work of krolik et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) considered the compton heating effect for the broad - line region of quasar .",
    "this effect is also important for the standard thin disk , if the disk is warped or irradiated by a source above the disk plane ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ; dubus et al .",
    "if the accretion flow is geometrically thick and optically thin , the photons can travel a large distance without being absorbed , therefore the global compton scattering effect is in principle important .",
    "this is the case for spherical accretion and hot accretion flows .",
    "the latter includes the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ; 1995 ) and luminous hot accretion flow ( lhaf ; yuan 2001 ; 2003 ) , two types of hot accretion flows corresponding to low and high accretion rates , respectively .    for spherical accretion ,",
    "the interaction of momentum between photons and electrons sets up a largest possible luminosity the accretion flow could reach , namely the eddington luminosity @xmath12 ( but this limit does not apply when the accretion flow has a non - zero angular momentum ; see , e.g. , ohsuga & mineshige 2007 ) . the effect of the energy interaction between photons and electrons in a spherical accretion flow has been investigated by ostriker et al .",
    "it was found that when the luminosity is larger than a certain value the outward energetic photons could heat gas flow significantly so that the local sound speed is larger than the escape speed , or , in other words , the temperature is higher than the virial temperature , thus the accretion is suppressed ; and this effect due to energy input from the outgoing radiation field occurs for much lower luminosities than the momentum ( eddington ) limit .    in almost all of the previous work on the dynamics of hot accretion flows ,",
    "only the `` local '' compton scattering effect has been considered while the global compton effect has been neglected .",
    "here `` local '' means that photons are produced at the same region with where the electrons locate .",
    "this local compton scattering serves as the main cooling mechanism of electrons ( compton cooling ) and the main mechanism of producing x - ray emission ( thermal comptonization ) .",
    "the only works to our knowledge considering the global compton scattering are esin ( 1997 ) and park & ostriker ( 1999 ; 2001 ; 2007 ) .",
    "esin ( 1997 ) deals with a one - dimensional adaf and finds that the global compton heating / cooling is not important and can be neglected .",
    "park & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) deal with a two - dimensional flow and focus on the possible production of outflow in the polar region because of strong compton heating there .",
    "their conclusion is that compton heating effect is important in many cases , which is quite different from esin s result .",
    "they do not attempt to obtain the self - consistent solutions .",
    "all their work are based on the self - similar solution of adaf ( narayan & yi 1994 ; 1995 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between esin and park & ostriker is likely due to the additional but different assumptions adopted . while the self - similar approximation is quite successful in catching the main spirit of an adaf , it is not a good approximation when we want to calculate the radiation since order of magnitude error could be produced .",
    "this is because the self - similar approximation breaks down at the inner region of the adaf where most of the radiation comes from .",
    "when we consider the effect of global compton heating / cooling , obviously it is crucial to calculate the exact spectrum from the exact global solution of the accretion flow .",
    "this is the main motivation of the present paper .",
    "in addition , important theoretical progress on adaf solutions have been made since its discovery .",
    "the two most important ones are the presence of outflow ( e.g. , stone & pringle 2001 ) and significant direct electron heating by turbulent dissipation ( e.g. , quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) , which is much stronger than the heating by coulomb collisions between ions and electrons .",
    "both of them are important in determining the dynamics of adafs while they have not been properly taken into account in the above works . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on the one - dimensional case , given that the uncertainty of our understanding to two - dimensional structure of accretion flow is still large .",
    "of course , a full understanding to the two - dimensional case is obviously important and should be a topic of future research .",
    "consider a canonical hot accretion flow without taking into account the global compton heating or cooling .",
    "outflow is taken into account by adopting the following radius - dependent mass accretion rate ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) : = -4r hv=_0()^s , where @xmath13 is the mass accretion rate at the outer boundary @xmath6 .",
    "the value of index @xmath14 describes the strength of the outflow and we use @xmath15 from the detailed modeling of sgr a * , the supermassive black hole in our galactic center ( yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "the energy equations for ions and electrons are v ( - p_i ^2 ) = ( 1-)q^+-q_ie , v ( - p_e ^2 ) = q^++q_ie - q^- , where @xmath16 is the internal energy of electrons and ions per unit mass of the gas , @xmath17 is the coulomb energy exchange rate between electrons and ions , @xmath18 is the electron cooling rate , including synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emissions and their local comptonization , @xmath19 is the net turbulent heating rate , the value of @xmath20 describes the fraction of turbulent heating which directly heats electrons and we use @xmath21 again from the modeling of sgr a * ( see also sharma et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we first get the exact global solution of the hot accretion flow so that we know all the quantities such as density and temperature as a function of radius .",
    "this requires us to solve the set of equations describing the conservations of mass ( eq .",
    "1 ) , energy ( eqs . 2 & 3 ) , and momentum ( ref .",
    "yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) . the global solution should satisfy the outer boundary condition at the outer boundary @xmath6 , the inner boundary condition at the horizon , and a sonic point condition at the sonic point . to calculate the rate of `` global '' compton heating / cooling of electrons at a given radius @xmath22 , we need to know the spectrum received at @xmath22 emitted by the whole flow .",
    "this requires us to solve the radiative transfer equations along the radial direction , which is complicated when scattering is important . for simplicity , here we deal with the scattering in a simple way and write the received spectrum at @xmath22 emitted by the flow inside of @xmath22 as , f_^in(r)=^r_r_se^- r here @xmath23 is the scattering optical depth from @xmath24 to @xmath22 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the emitted monochromatic luminosity from a shell at @xmath24 with thickness @xmath27 and height @xmath28 .",
    "it includes synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emissions and their local comptonization .",
    "we approximate the calculation of the unscattered part of @xmath26 by solving the radiative transfer along the vertical direction of adafs adopting a two - stream approximation ( manmoto , mineshige & kusunose 1997 ) : dl_^un(r)= b_[1-exp(-2_^*)]rdr here @xmath29 denotes the planck spectrum , @xmath30 is the optical depth for absorption in the vertical direction with @xmath31 being the absorption coefficient on the equatorial plane .",
    "the free - free absorption and synchrotron self - absorption are included in this way .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the accretion flow is determined by a parameter @xmath32 defined as the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure and we set @xmath33 . for the calculation of the compton scattered part of @xmath26",
    ", we use the approach of coppi & blandford ( 1990 ; eq .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( 4 ) begins from the black hole horizon @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrum received at @xmath22 emitted by the flow outside of @xmath22 is ( park & ostriker 2007 ) , f_^out(r)=^r_out_r dr the total spectrum received at @xmath22 is the sum of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the electrons have a maxwell distribution with temperature @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and the energy of the photon before scattering is @xmath39 .",
    "since the electrons in the hot accretion flow are relativistic at the innermost region and the peak photon energy @xmath40 , to calculate the average energy of a scattered photon , we use the following exact form which is valid for any photon energy and electrons temperature ( guilbert 1986 ) : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and the cross - section for scattering ( , _ e)= ^+_-g_0(e^ ) e^2exp()d . here",
    "@xmath43 is a modified bessel function of second order and : g_n(y ) ^2_0 ( t(t-2)+1+ty+ ) . in the thompson limit , eqs .",
    "( 7 ) & ( 8) are transformed into the familiar form of = + , and ( , _ e)=_t .",
    "the number of scattering in a region of the accretion flow with unit width in the radial direction and scattering optical depth @xmath44 is n=_es , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the temperature and number density of electrons in that region .",
    "the compton heating ( cooling ) rate in that region ( with unit radial length ) is then q_comp = n  [ f_^in(r)+f_^out(r ) ] d. note that in the above equation we actually use the moment of intensity `` @xmath47 '' not ",
    "@xmath48  .",
    "following park & ostriker ( 2007 ) , we formally define a `` radiation temperature '' ( or `` compton temperature '' ; see also levich & sunyaev 1970 ; krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) : _",
    "x.under this definition , whether the compton scattering plays a heating or cooling effect roughly depends on whether the electron temperature @xmath45 is larger or smaller than @xmath49 . in the thompson limit , the compton heating / cooling rate is exactly proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "it is important to note here that the radiation temperature is obtained from the flux distribution by weighting with the factor @xmath51 .",
    "it physically represents the equilibrium between compton heating and cooling . for a typical quasar spectrum",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath52k or several kev where the bulk of the radiation is emitted in the uv or , in some cases , ir portions of the spectrum ( mathews & ferland 1987 ; sazonov , ostriker & sunyaev 2004 ) . as we will see below ( e.g. , ref .",
    "3 ( c ) ) , the radiation temperature of an adaf spectrum is much higher because of its different spectrum .",
    "+    the dominant heating term of electrons in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is @xmath53 .",
    "we compare the rate of global compton heating / cooling with @xmath54 and the results are shown in fig . 1 for @xmath55 with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "at large radii , @xmath3 , compton scattering heats electrons ; while at small radii , @xmath59 , it cools electrons .",
    "this is of course because the radiation temperature @xmath49 is lower ( higher ) than the electron temperature @xmath60 at the small ( large ) radii , as shown by the right panel of fig . 1 .",
    "+    we can see from the left panel of fig .",
    "1 that the compton effect is important when @xmath61 . in this case",
    ", its cooling effect can not be neglected .",
    "the corresponding accretion rate at the black hole horizon is @xmath62 and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath63 .",
    "the `` lowest '' value of @xmath13 above which compton heating effect is important is a function of @xmath6 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "this value is @xmath65 and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath6 is larger , the value of critical @xmath13 is lower . in reality @xmath6",
    "usually has a largest feasible value .",
    "if the adaf starts out from a transition from a standard thin disk , @xmath6 equals to the transition radius .",
    "if on the other hand the accretion flow starts out as an adaf such as in our galactic center , @xmath6 should be determined by the bondi radius . outside of bondi radius , the effect of compton heating",
    "is not so clear , because matching an adaf solution to one with proper boundary condition at infinity is an unsolved problem .",
    "our result that compton scattering heats electrons at large radii while cools electrons at small radii is qualitatively consistent with both esin ( 1997 ) and park & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) .",
    "however , esin ( 1997 ) found that compton heating rate is always even smaller than the coulomb collision heating rate therefore is negligible .",
    "this is different from our results and park & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) .",
    "the reason may comes from some over - simplifications and the different ( old ) adaf model adopted in esin ( 1997 ) .",
    "overall , we see that for extended solutions ( @xmath67 ) , both compton cooling in the inner parts and compton heating in the outer parts dramatically alter the solutions when @xmath68 .",
    "the above result indicates that we should take into account the effect of global compton heating / cooling when we calculate the global solution of the hot accretion flow when @xmath69 is relatively large .",
    "this has not been studied in esin ( 1997 ) and park & ostriker ( 1999 ; 2001 ; 2007 ) .",
    "we use an iteration method to achieve this .",
    "we first solve the global solution without considering the global compton effect , calculating the rate of compton heating / cooling at each radius as described above , @xmath70 .",
    "we then include this term in the energy equations of electrons : v ( - p_e ^2 ) = q^+ + q_ie - q^- + q_comp , and calculate the `` new '' global solution of the accretion flow based on this `` new '' equation .",
    "then we get a new compton heating / cooling rate .",
    "if the new rate is not equal to the guessed value we replace the guessed value with the new one and repeat this procedure until they are equal .",
    "however , we must emphasize that the solution obtained by the above approach is actually not exactly `` self - consistent '' .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 13 ) to calculate @xmath70 .",
    "but in eq .",
    "( 13 ) , only the local compton scattering is considered when calculating @xmath71 , and the global scattering is difficult to include because we do nt know the spectrum emitted at other radii which again requires to consider global scattering .",
    "this is difficult to deal with even using the iteration approach .",
    "the best way to solve this problem is by monte carlo simulation combined with iteration method .",
    "this is beyond the scape of this paper and will be our next work . on the other hand ,",
    "we believe our result should be a good zeroth - order approximation to the real solution .",
    "bearing this in mind , figs .",
    "2&3 show the calculation results . figs .",
    "2 ( a  c ) are for a stellar mass black hole with black hole mass @xmath72 and @xmath73 . fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the electron temperature of the global solution without ( solid line ) and with ( dashed line ) the global compton scattering effect included . because compton scattering plays a cooling role at small radii",
    ", we see that the electron temperature decreases after the compton effect is taken into account as we expect .",
    "2(b ) shows the ratio of compton heating and local viscous heating of the electrons , @xmath74 , before ( solid line ) and after ( dashed line ) the global compton effect is included .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath75 , the absolute value of this ratio is between @xmath76 .",
    "since we typically have @xmath77 , this implies that the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 15 ) is negative in that region , i.e. , the viscous heating of electrons is smaller than its radiative cooling ( @xmath78 . in another words , the energy advection of electrons plays a heating role , just like the ions in the lhaf solution ( yuan 2001 ) . in the inner region of @xmath79 , where most of the radiation comes from , the absolute value of @xmath80 .",
    "we find in this case @xmath81 .",
    "so in the innermost region the viscous heating of electrons is equal to its radiative cooling ( @xmath78 .",
    "obviously , after taking into account the global compton cooling , the radiative efficiency will increase for a given accretion rate .",
    "but this does not mean that the highest luminosity @xmath82 a hot accretion flow can produce will increase .",
    "the main heating mechanism of electrons are viscous heating and compression work ( the second term in the right - hand side of eq . 15 ) while the main cooling comes from ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the highest accretion rate beyond which a hot solution no longer exists is determined by the balance between heating and cooling .",
    "the heating term is roughly proportional to @xmath69 while the cooling term roughly to @xmath84 since compton scattering is a two - body collision process .",
    "this is why a hot accretion solution has a highest @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , when the global compton cooling @xmath70 is included , the cooling becomes stronger compared to the case of only local cooling @xmath18 , thus the balance between cooling and heating will occur at a lower @xmath69 .",
    "actually @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "2 is almost the highest accretion rate at which we can get the self - consistent hot solution , which is a factor of 2 - 3 lower than the highest rate when the global compton effect is not taken into account .",
    "when @xmath13 is higher , we find that we are not able to get the self - consistent solution since the flow will collapse due to the strong radiative cooling .",
    "the decrease of the highest @xmath69 results in the decrease of @xmath82 .",
    "our calculation shows that @xmath82 decreases by a factor of @xmath86 2 , i.e. , we now have @xmath87 .",
    "we now check how different the spectrum produced by the self - consistent solution is compared to the spectrum produced by the `` old '' solution .",
    "2(c ) shows the spectra from the hot accretion flow before ( solid line ) and after ( dashed line ) the compton effect is taken into account .",
    "we see that both the luminosity and the cutoff energy of the spectrum ( i.e. , the corresponding frequency of the peak of the spectrum ) decrease because of the global compton cooling .",
    "this is of course because the electron temperature of the self - consistent solution decreases compared to the `` old '' solution .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that only local seed photons are considered when we calculate the spectrum although we do consider the global scattering in calculating the dynamics .",
    "our calculation shows that @xmath88 , so we expect that when the global compton scattering is considered the luminosity of the `` exact '' self - consistent solution will be @xmath89 times higher than that shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "but the slope and the cutoff energy will not change because they are irrelevant to the amount of seed photons .",
    "3 ( a  c ) are similar to figs . 2 ( a  c ) , but are for a supermassive black hole with @xmath90 and accretion rate @xmath91 .",
    "we see from the figures that the electron temperature decreases after the global compton scattering effect is taken into account as we expect , because in most region the compton scattering will cool the electrons .",
    "correspondingly , the luminosity of the accretion flow also decreases by roughly a factor of 2 and the cutoff energy of the spectrum also becomes smaller .",
    "we have also calculated the average energy of the photons emitted by the self - consistent solution shown in fig .",
    "3 ( c ) , @xmath92 , and the corresponding energy of the radiation temperature @xmath49 at @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the results are @xmath95 1  ev and 100  kev respectively , and they are shown by two arrows in fig .",
    "these values are much higher than that of a typical quasar spectrum where , e.g. , @xmath96 is only several kev ( mathews & ferland 1987 ; sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "3 ( c ) extends to very high energy , @xmath97 mev .",
    "observationally , the @xmath98-folding energy of the average power - law x - ray spectrum observed by _ ginga _ ,",
    "osse , and _ exsosat _ of radio - quiet seyfert 1s is @xmath99 mev ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 ; gondek et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is consistent with the model given the ( large ) error bar .",
    "better data is required to constrain the theoretical model .",
    "as we state in  2.2 , compton heating effect at large radii is another obstacle for us to obtain the self - consistent solution . for @xmath100 , if @xmath101 , we find that the compton heating effect around @xmath6 is so strong that the equilibrium temperature of electrons would be higher than the virial value defined as @xmath102 , which will in turn make the ion temperature also higher than the virial one due to the coulomb coupling between them . in this case , the gas is unbound thus can not be accreted .",
    "the corresponding highest luminosity in this case is @xmath103 .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained by ostriker et al .",
    "( 1976 ) and park & ostriker ( 2001 ) . from figs . 1 & 3(b )",
    ", we expect that @xmath13 and the critical @xmath6 ( signed as @xmath104 ) beyond which the equilibrium temperature is higher than the virial temperature are roughly anti - correlated , i.e. , a lower @xmath13 corresponds to a larger @xmath105 .",
    "exact estimation of the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath105 is not straightforward .",
    "this is because we need to know the radiation temperature @xmath49 as a function of @xmath13 which requires numerical calculations .",
    "note that from figs . 1 & 3(b ) the minimum value of @xmath105 should be larger than @xmath106 .",
    "although no steady self - consistent solution exists due to the strong compton heating at and beyond @xmath105 , an `` oscillation '' of the activity of the black hole is expected ( e.g. , cowie , ostriker , & stark 1978 ; ciotti & ostriker 2007 ) .",
    "when the accretion rate is high , only the gas inside of @xmath105 can be accreted .",
    "this active phase will last for a timescale of the accretion timescale at @xmath105 .",
    "then all the gas will be used up and the active phase stops . in this case",
    ", compton heating also stops so the gas outside of @xmath105 will be cooled by radiation and be accreted again and the cycle repeats .",
    "the time the non - active phase will last is determined by the radiative timescale of the gas at @xmath105 , since it is longer than the accretion timescale there .",
    "an alternative consequence of the strong compton heating at large radii is that the accretion can be self - regulated by irradiating the outer flow ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "that is , the strong compton heating will not completely stop the accretion , but only decrease the accretion rate .",
    "this then reduces the energy release in the inner part , which in turn reduces the irradiation .",
    "a multi - dimensional numerical simulation is required to solve this issue and accurate time - dependence is needed as well since steady solutions may not be stable .    for the massive black holes seen in the nuclei of most galaxies the compton heated interruption of the high luminosity states should be typical if a hot accretion flow exists there .",
    "we now know that the accretion flow in low - luminosity agns is of this type ( see yuan 2007 and ho 2008 for reviews ) . for luminous agns such as quasars ,",
    "although people incline to think it is a standard thin disk which is optically thick , many problems remain for this model ( e.g. , shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ; koratkar & blaes 1999 ) .",
    "if the actual accretion flow is radially optically thin to compton scattering , similar to the hot accretion flow , our analysis applies .",
    "this kind of oscillation does not apply to stellar mass black holes in our galaxy .",
    "this is because the prerequisite for such oscillation is that the accretion rate is large and the hot accretion flow extends to large radii .",
    "for a stellar mass black hole , the accretion material comes from the companion star and it starts out as a standard thin disk . in the hard state",
    "the standard disk does not extend to the innermost stable circular orbit but is replaced by a hot accretion flow within a transition radius @xmath107 .",
    "when the accretion rate is high , @xmath107 is small ( yuan & narayan 2004 ) .",
    "so compton scattering cools rather than heats the hot accretion flow .",
    "but on the other hand , the photons emitted by the hot accretion flow will heat the cool electrons in the standard disk at @xmath107 and thus will change the dynamics of the transition .",
    "this effect has never been noted and could be a topic of future work .",
    "for a geometrically thick and optically thin hot accretion flow , the photons can travel for a long distance without being absorbed , and thus be able to heat or cool electrons via compton scattering .",
    "we investigate this global compton scattering effect and find that for an accretion rate described by @xmath0 the compton cooling effect will be important when @xmath108 ; while the compton heating effect will be important when @xmath109 and @xmath1 . specifically , the scattering heats electrons at @xmath110 while cools electrons at @xmath111 . if @xmath6 is larger , the critical @xmath13 above which the compton heating effect is important will become lower .",
    "we have successfully obtained the self - consistent steady solution with this effect included for @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "but when @xmath114 and @xmath115 we fail because of the strong radiative cooling ( local plus global compton scattering ) . it is also difficult to get the self - consistent solution when @xmath114 ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 .",
    "this is because in this case the compton heating is so strong at and beyond @xmath6 that the equilibrium electron temperature there will be higher than the virial temperature .",
    "more generally we expect that the radius where the equilibrium temperature due to the compton heating is equal to the virial temperature , @xmath105 , is anti - correlated with @xmath118 .",
    "we argue that the black hole will manifest an oscillation of the activity in the case that we fail to get the steady solution",
    ". the period will be the radiative timescale of the gas at @xmath105 .",
    "all our discussions so far are for a one - dimensional ( but not spherical ) accretion flow .",
    "although big uncertainties exist for the vertical structure of accretion flow , we are certain that when @xmath69 is high , the scattering will be important , and consequently much of the luminosity will `` leak out '' perpendicular to the accretion flow as in the standard thin disk .",
    "this will have two effects .",
    "one is that the highest luminosity up to which we can get the self - consistent solution with the global compton effect included will be higher .",
    "in addition , the compton heating will be stronger in the vertical direction than in the equatorial plane of the flow . as a result",
    "strong wind will be launched as pointed out by park & ostriker ( 2001 ; 2007 ) and found by proga et al .",
    "all of the described effects are likely to become significant for agn accretion flows having @xmath119 and optically thin ( ref .  3 for discussion of this possibility in luminous agns ) ,",
    "which , we know from recent applications of the soltan argument ( yu & tremaine 2002 ) , are the phases during which most massive black hole growth occurs .",

    "<S> if the mass accretion rate is described by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we find that the compton scattering will play a cooling and heating role at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . specifically , when @xmath4 , the compton cooling rate is larger than the local viscous heating rate at certain radius ; therefore the cooling effect is important . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 , the heating effect at @xmath6 is important . </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain the self - consistent steady solution with the global compton effect included only if @xmath7 for @xmath8 , which corresponds to @xmath9 . above this rate </S>",
    "<S> the compton cooling is so strong at the inner region that hot solutions can not exist . on the other hand , for @xmath10 , we can only get the self - consistent solution when @xmath7 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of this critical accretion rate is anti - correlated with the value of @xmath6 . above this accretion rate </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium temperature of electrons at @xmath6 is higher than the virial temperature as a result of strong compton heating , so the accretion is suppressed . in this case the activity of the black hole will likely `` oscillate '' between an active and an inactive phases , with the oscillation timescale being the radiative timescale of the gas at @xmath6 . </S>"
