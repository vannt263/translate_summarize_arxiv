    "an innovation is an idea , practice , or object that is perceived as new by a community . in many situations ,",
    "the diffusion of an innovation involves one individual ",
    "the innovator  who informs potential adopters about a new idea and who , in turn , pass on the information to their near - peers .",
    "this exchange of information occurs through a convergence process in which the participants share information with one another to reach a mutual understanding .",
    "the transfer of ideas occurs most frequently between two individuals who are alike @xcite .",
    "the above sketchy account of the process of diffusion of innovations , which is based on everett rogers 1962 seminal book diffusion of innovations @xcite , contains all ingredients of a very popular agent - based model proposed much later by the political scientist robert axelrod @xcite to explain the persistence of cultural diversity in the society despite the effect of social influence that tends to increase the similarity of interacting agents . since axelrod uses the term culture to indicate any set of individual attributes that are susceptible to social influence , his model suits well to study the diffusion of innovations within rogers framework .    in axelrod s model",
    "the agents are represented by strings of cultural features of length @xmath0 , where each feature can adopt @xmath1 distinct states ( i.e. , @xmath1 is the common number of states each feature can assume ) .",
    "a characteristic that sets axelrod s model apart from most models of social influence ( see @xcite for reviews ) is that it accounts for homophily , which is the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar to them . in particular , according to the rules of axelrod s model , the interaction between two neighboring agents occurs with probability proportional to the number of cultural states they have in common : agents who do not have any cultural state in common can not interact and the interaction between agents who share all their cultural states does not result in any change .",
    "this is a most important characteristic from the perspective of the diffusion of innovations since the very nature of diffusion requires some degree of heterophily between the innovator and the other agents : ideally , they would be homophilous on all other variables ( e.g. , education and social status ) even though they are heterophilous regarding the innovation @xcite . in axelrod s model",
    "an interaction between two neighboring agents consists of selecting at random one of the distinct features , and making the selected feature of one of the agents  the target agent  equal to its neighbor s corresponding state .",
    "this rule models social influence since the agents become more similar after they interact .",
    "hence there is a positive feedback loop between homophily and social influence : similarity lead to interaction , and interaction leads to still more similarity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we model the innovation as a novel state ( say , state @xmath13 ) that appears in the initial configuration at a single cultural feature ( say , feature @xmath14 ) of a single agent ( the innovator ) located at the origin of a regular lattice of linear size @xmath15 with periodic boundary conditions or at the origin of a random graph of @xmath5 nodes .",
    "( in both cases the choice of the origin is arbitrary . ) in the regular lattice , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lattice dimension .",
    "the @xmath0 cultural features of all other agents , as well as the @xmath18 features of the innovator , are set randomly according to a uniform distribution in the integers @xmath19 , as usual @xcite .",
    "the important ingredient here is that the innovation in the innovator ( i.e. , the state of feature 1 of the agent at the origin ) is fixed and can not be changed by the rules of axelrod s model .",
    "however , all other agents that adopt the innovation ( adopters ) may , in principle , discard it through the interactions with their neighbors .",
    "this scheme is similar to the framework used to study cultural drift in axelrod s model , modeled as a perturbation ( noise ) acting continuously at a single site of the lattice @xcite , or to the presence of a zealot in the voter model @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that both the noise source site and the zealot can change their states due to the interactions with their neighbors and their eventual return to the original states is guaranteed by external mechanisms .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath20 , the ultimate fate of the innovation depends on the set of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , since",
    "the choice of these parameters determine whether the population reaches a consensus regime in which all agents ( or at least a macroscopic number of agents ) share the same culture or the population is fragmented in an infinity of cultural domains of microscopic size .",
    "the nonequilibrium phase transition separating these two stationary regimes has been object of intensive research by the statistical physics community @xcite .",
    "clearly , in our scenario of diffusion of innovations the consensus regime corresponds to the situation in which the innovation is adopted by the entire population ( i.e. , the introduction of the innovation in the community was successful ) : since the innovator has the innovation fixed there can not be consensus unless all agents adopt the innovation .",
    "the multi - cultural regime corresponds to the situation in which the innovation is confined to a finite region around the innovator .",
    "we find that in the consensus regime , where the introduction of the innovation is successful , the initial spreading of the innovation is ballistic in the one - dimensional regular lattice and diffusive in the two - dimensional case .",
    "more pointedly , we show that , regardless of the topology and connectivity of the network , initially the number of adopters always increases linearly with the time @xmath2 , and we derive an analytical expression for its ( constant ) rate of increase @xmath21 for short times . in the time",
    "asymptotic limit , we find that axelrod s model in the presence of the innovator behaves essentially as the voter model in presence of a zealot , and so the number of adopters grows with @xmath22 for the one - dimensional lattice and with @xmath23 for the two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "however , in regular lattices the typical growth curves for the number of adopters do not exhibit the classical s - shape observed in the innovation diffusion experiments @xcite .",
    "the sigmoid - shaped growth curves are recovered for random graphs of large average connectivity @xmath6 . for random graphs with an infinite number of nodes we find that the number of adopters increases with @xmath7 where @xmath24 for @xmath25 irrespective of the values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , provided the convergence to the consensus regime is guaranteed .",
    "for @xmath11 we find @xmath26 .",
    "since the exponent @xmath12 is sensitive to the social network topology it may be a useful quantitative measure to characterize the process of diffusion of innovations in diverse scenarios .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a brief account of axelrod s model and describe how the model is modified so as to reckon with the presence of the innovator at the origin of the network . in section [ sec:1d ]",
    "we study the spreading of the innovation in the one - dimensional lattice and present the analytical calculation of the rate @xmath27 for short times .",
    "in addition , we estimate the diffusion constant in the time asymptotic limit by assuming that the axelrod model in the presence of the innovator approaches the consensus regime in a similar way as the voter model @xcite .",
    "the spreading in the two - dimensional lattice is considered in section [ sec:2d ] and the spreading in random graphs in section [ sec : random ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] offers our concluding remarks .",
    "in axelrod s model each agent is characterized by a set of @xmath0 cultural features and each feature can take on @xmath1 different states , which we label by the integers @xmath28 .",
    "hence there are @xmath29 distinct cultures in total . in the initial configuration ( @xmath30 )",
    "each agent is assigned one of these cultures with equal probability .",
    "the @xmath5 agents are fixed in the nodes ( sites ) of a network . here",
    "we will consider the one - dimensional ( @xmath31 ) and the two - dimensional ( @xmath32 ) regular lattices of linear length @xmath15 with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , a ring and a torus , respectively , where only nearest - neighbors interactions are allowed . to probe the effects of the short - ranged interactions and of the low average connectivity of those regular lattices we will consider random graphs with average connectivity @xmath11 and @xmath33 , as well .    according to the dynamics of the original model @xcite , at each time",
    "@xmath2 we pick an agent at random  the target agent  as well as one of its neighbors . as usual in such asynchronous update scheme we choose the time unit as @xmath34 .",
    "these two agents interact with probability equal to their cultural similarity , defined as the fraction of common cultural features .",
    "as pointed out before , this procedure models homophily .",
    "an interaction consists of selecting at random one of the distinct features , and making the selected feature of the target agent equal to its neighbor s corresponding state .",
    "we note that neighboring agents with antagonistic cultures ( i.e. , cultures that do not share any cultural state ) do not interact , whereas in the case the two agents are identical , the interaction produces no changes .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the system is frozen into an absorbing configuration . at an absorbing configuration any pair of neighbors",
    "are either identical or completely different regarding their cultural states .",
    "our scenario to study the diffusion of innovations in axelrod s model requires a simple modification of the original setup described above .",
    "in particular , we assume that there is a special agent  the innovator  located at the origin of the network who exhibits a novel cultural state in one of its cultural features . without loss of generality , at the beginning of the simulation we assign the new state @xmath13 to the cultural feature 1 of the innovator ; the other @xmath18 features are set randomly to the usual @xmath1 states as done for the @xmath0 features of the other agents .",
    "hence at @xmath30 the innovator and the rest of the population are heterophilous regarding the innovation .",
    "in addition , for the innovator only the state @xmath13 ( i.e. , the innovation ) is fixed and can not be changed through the interaction with the other agents .",
    "more specifically , in the case the innovator is selected as the target agent and its cultural feature 1 is selected to change , we do not implement the change . otherwise , all other interactions follow the usual rules of the axelrod model .",
    "we stress that this exception holds for the innovator only .",
    "the novel state can be replaced by the other states when the other agents are updated . of course",
    ", only feature 1 of the agents can assume the novel state @xmath13 as the dynamics unfolds ; the remaining @xmath18 features take on the usual states @xmath35 .",
    "the main measure we will consider in this paper is the mean number of agents who have adopted the innovation ( adopters ) at a given time @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the mean fraction of agents that exhibit the innovation ( i.e. , state @xmath13 at cultural feature 1 ) . note that the innovator does not count as an adopter . in the one - dimensional lattice the adopters form a compact domain of length @xmath38 around the innovator .",
    "our aim in this section is to understand how the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 influence the diffusion of the innovation in a ring of @xmath39 agents which are allowed to interact with their two nearest neighbors only .",
    "it is well - known that in the absence of the innovator at the origin of the lattice the model exhibits a phase transition in the space of parameters @xmath40 that separates the regimes characterized by consensus and multicultural absorbing configurations @xcite .",
    "typically , the consensus regime occurs in the region of small @xmath1 and large @xmath0 , whereas the multicultural regime occurs for large @xmath1 and small @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath41 the innovator - free model exhibits a consensus regime for @xmath42 and a multicultural regime for @xmath43 in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we do not expect that the presence of the innovator would in any way alter this transition .",
    "however , the spreading of the innovation should depend strongly on whether the parameters of the innovator - free model are set so as to favor consensus or cultural diversity .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the mean number of agents that have adopted the innovation at time @xmath2 for the parameter set @xmath41 and @xmath44 , which corresponds to the consensus phase of the innovator - free model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "of course , since for finite @xmath15 the number of adopters is bounded by the lattice size @xmath39 , we must observe a saturation of the number of adopters in the asymptotic limit @xmath45 .",
    "however , if we increase @xmath15 and keep @xmath2 finite ( i.e. , take the limit @xmath46 before the limit @xmath45 @xcite ) then all data fall on the power law function @xmath47 with @xmath48 for large @xmath2 , which shows that in the asymptotic time limit the spreading of the innovation is diffusive in an infinite lattice . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "we observe a ballistic spreading of the innovation in the ring ( i.e. , @xmath49 with @xmath8 ) with a rate @xmath27 that is independent of the lattice size .",

    "however , the manner @xmath129 scales with @xmath2 in this limit offers a most valuable characterization of the spreading process , as shown in the previous sections for regular lattices . to investigate whether the absence of the s - shaped growth curves for the number of adopters in axelrod s model is due to the short - ranged nature of the interactions ( nearest neighbors ) or to the low connectivity of the regular lattices , in this section we study the spreading of innovations in random graphs with @xmath5 nodes and average connectivity @xmath6 .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the graphs we consider here are not the classical random graphs but the limit of sure rewiring of the watts and strogatz algorithm for constructing small - world networks @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we begin with a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath5 nodes , each node connected to @xmath6 neighbors ( @xmath130 on each side ) , and periodic boundary conditions . then for every node @xmath131 we rewire the @xmath130 links between @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( the sums are done modulo @xmath5 ) with probability @xmath134 .",
    "rewiring of a link is done by replacing the original neighbor of node @xmath132 by a random node chosen uniformly among all possible nodes that avoid self - loops and link duplication .",
    "the advantage of this formulation , which was also used in the studies of axelrod s model on complex networks @xcite , is that the origin ( i.e. , the node @xmath135 , where the innovator is located ) is guaranteed to be connected to at least @xmath130 nodes , regardless of the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas for the classical random graphs that particular node has probability @xmath136 of being isolated from the other @xmath137 nodes .",

    "[ fig:5 ] we consider low connectivity random graphs ( @xmath11 ) for the purpose of comparison with the one - dimensional lattice . as in that case",
    ", the growth curves do not exhibit inflection points .",
    "for such a low connectivity graph it is difficult to establish the existence of a consensus regime because the graphs may not be connected , so that the spreading of the innovation is restricted to the innovator s connected subgraph and , in this case , the asymptotic values of the number of adopters would be determined by the distribution of the sizes of the connected subgraphs .",
    "nevertheless , since on the average the size of that subgraph increases with increasing @xmath5 , it is still possible to observe the unlimited growth of the number of adopters with increasing time in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] which shows that the number of adopters scales with @xmath7 with @xmath142 for @xmath41 and @xmath44 , indicating that the innovation spreads faster , due to the long range links , than in the chain with nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "for @xmath11 we find the same value of that exponent ( i.e. , @xmath143 ) for all @xmath144 and @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath145 the consensus regime occurs for @xmath44 only , and in that case we find @xmath146 .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows the adopters growth curves for high connectivity random graphs ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "this time the typical s - shaped curves show up provided the initial cultural diversity @xmath1 is not too small .",
    "we did not find evidence of a multicultural regime in the thermodynamic limit in this case .",
    "for instance , the large @xmath2 portion of the curve for @xmath147 moves up as @xmath5 increases eventually reaching the consensus regime ( see @xcite for a brief discussion of the phase transition in such random graphs ) . figure [ fig:8 ] shows that in the consensus regime the number of innovators scales linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "more generally and in contrast to the case @xmath11 , we find @xmath24 for @xmath148 regardless of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , provided that the introduction of the innovation is successful .",
    "it is also instructive to evaluate the mean time @xmath149 to reach a consensus absorbing configuration for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows that the mean freezing time grows linearly with the number of nodes @xmath5 , which is somewhat surprising since for a regular lattice the freezing time scales with the square of the number of sites @xcite .",
    "the high connectivity of the graphs is probably accountable for this change in the scaling of @xmath149 with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , since only the consensus regime is observed in our simulations we have @xmath150 in the very long - time ( saturation ) limit .",
    "as in the analysis of the regular lattices , we find that the long - time dynamics in the consensus regime is not affected by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected : in the initial configuration , @xmath1 yields the number of different states that a given cultural feature can take on and as the dynamics proceeds towards a consensus absorbing configuration the social influence acts so as to decrease that number , leading eventually to a situation , in the limit of very large @xmath2 , where each feature exhibits only two distinct states .",
    "hence in the consensus regime the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics should not depend on @xmath1 or , more pointedly , for an infinite lattice the model should behave as if @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "the focus of this study was on the spreading of an innovation in a decentralized diffusion system in which the exchange of information among the potential adopters of an innovation is the main mechanism through which innovations spread @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could also consider a centralized diffusion system in which the innovation is presented to the individuals by an external source such as a global media @xcite . in the framework of axelrod s model , the media",
    "is viewed as a global external field and its effects have been studied in great detail in the statistical physics literature @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our findings for the decentralized diffusion system , the relaxation to the absorbing configurations in the presence of the external field is much faster than the relaxation in its absence , and this very rapid relaxation results in concave growth curves for the number of agents who adopted the states of the external field .",
    "in fact , although axelrod s model accommodates the two key ingredients  homophily and social influence ",
    "necessary to describe the spreading of an innovation in a community , it does not always reproduce the classical s - shaped growth curves for the number of adopters of an innovation @xcite . for finite populations in general and for infinite populations in the multicultural regime ,",
    "the saturation part of the sigmoid growth curves is easily reproduced in the limit of large @xmath2 , of course . since for short times",
    "the number of adopters grows linearly with @xmath2 , regardless of the network topology , the existence of an inflection point requires an intermediate stage of superlinear growth .",
    "such stage appears as a marginal quirk in the one - dimensional lattice ( see curve for @xmath151 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) which is imperceptible when plotted in a linear scale . in the square lattice",
    ", the superlinear growth stage appears only in a narrow crossover region between the consensus and the multicultural regimes ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the requirement of an intermediate stage of superlinear growth for the existence of an inflection point in the adopters growth curves for finite systems can be justified as follows .",
    "first , we note that for all the network topologies considered in this paper our simulations have revealed that the growth curves are linear in the short - time regime and that the linear coefficient @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .",
    "second , we note that for finite systems the number of adopters saturates in the long - time regime , where the growth curves are concave functions of @xmath2 .",
    "these two extremes can be joined continuously by a concave growth curve such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , for which the first derivatives decrease continuously from the value @xmath27 at @xmath30 to the value @xmath85 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "third , we note that to exhibit an inflection point a growth curve must have an intermediate region where its first derivative is larger than @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , joining the short - time portion of the curve ( derivative equal to @xmath27 ) with this intermediate portion ( derivative greater than @xmath27 ) produces a region where the growth curve is convex .",
    "since close to the saturation regime the curve is concave there must exist an inflection point at which the concavity of the curve changes .",
    "finally , we note that since it is not possible to have a continuously differentiable growth curve by joining two linear segments ( i.e. , the segment with linear coefficient @xmath27 and a hypothetical segment with linear coefficient greater than @xmath27 ) , then the growth curve must exhibit a stage of superlinear growth .",
    "our analysis of the diffusion of innovations in random graphs suggests that the desired s - shaped growth curves emerge from the trade - off between the average connectivity @xmath6 , which must be large enough to guarantee a superlinear speedup of number of adopters , and the initial per feature diversity @xmath1 , which has the effect of reducing the probability of interactions and hence of slowing down the spreading of the innovation .",
    "the interplay between these parameters is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:7 ] . for low connectivity random graphs ( see fig .  [ fig:5 ] )",
    ", after the initial linear spreading the number of adopters grows sublinearly with @xmath2 and so the growth curves are concave functions of the time regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is probably an effect of the existence of many weakly connected subgraphs with bottlenecks that hinder the transmission of the innovation between them .",
    "the recipe to produce an inflection point for high connectivity random graphs is to begin the spreading with a low rate @xmath27 ( the earlier adopters stage ) , which can be achieved by choosing a large value of @xmath1 , according to eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , and wait till the number of adopters reaches a critical value ( approximately 100 adopters at @xmath152 for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "the high connectivity of the graph will then ensure a superlinear spreading ( the take - off stage ) and a quick saturation ( the later adopters stage ) due to the finitude of the graph .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "however , a more quantitative and unambiguous characterization of the process of diffusion of innovations is obtained by studying the approach to the consensus regime in an infinite lattice , i.e. , by determining how the number of adopters scales with @xmath2 in the limit @xmath45 . in particular , our monte carlo simulations indicate that in this limit axelrod s model in the presence of the innovator behaves as the voter model in presence of a zealot , and so the number of adopters grows with @xmath22 for the one - dimensional lattice and with @xmath23 for the two - dimensional lattice @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "the spreading is diffusive in one dimension and sub - diffusive in two dimensions . for random graphs with average connectivity @xmath25",
    "we find that the number of adopters grows with @xmath7 where @xmath153 .",
    "our finding that @xmath10 for @xmath11 indicates that the value of this exponent is sensitive to the network topology and so it may be a useful measure to compare the efficiency of the process of diffusion of successful innovations in different scenarios .",
