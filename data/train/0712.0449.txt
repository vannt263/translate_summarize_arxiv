    "transport properties of disordered solids attracted lot of attention . the quantum percolation ( qp ) problem@xcite has been studied several decades and some questions are still open , compared to the more settled anderson model@xcite .",
    "first of all , do both models belong to the same universality class ?",
    "positive answer means that the critical exponent @xmath0 of localization length should be the same , i. e. @xmath1 in 3d and in presence of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the best data come from transfer matrix ( tm ) calculations of anderson model@xcite .",
    "another question is the validity range of single parameter scaling ( sps ) .",
    "it is possible , that sps does not work in the middle of the conduction band for 3d qp , which is the case also for 1d anderson model@xcite , but not for 3d anderson model ( at least numerically ) .",
    "contrary to the still discussed 2d qp case@xcite , all authors agree that metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is present in 3d , but they often disagree in details .",
    "the mobility edge trajectory ( mit line in energy @xmath2 vs. disorder plane ) in 3d is qualitatively clear and widely accepted @xcite , with possible jumps at special energies of incoming non - interacting transport careers ( @xmath3@xcite . we aim to comment the nature of these jumps in more detail - for site percolation , but the bond percolation behaves similarly@xcite .",
    "the common universality further requires constant @xmath0 along the mobility edge .",
    "the exponent should be the same both with respect to changing @xmath2 at fixed disorder and vice versa@xcite .",
    "we will check all these statements numerically .",
    "another widely accepted fact is that @xmath0 should be identical both for site and bond percolation .",
    "the values of the exponent @xmath0 given in literature differ heavily .",
    "some methods seem to overestimate the true value , if we accept @xmath4 as correct also for qp .",
    "renorm - group calculations gave @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thouless conductivity@xcite yielded @xmath7 on fcc lattice . on the other hand a special version of tm method with approximative reduction of matrices@xcite suggested @xmath8 and cluster expansion with pad approximation@xcite yielded @xmath9 .",
    "the last value violates even the chayes bound @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is dimension .",
    "it is known from the anderson model , that level spacing methods tend to somewhat underestimate @xmath0 compared to the tm value ; they suggest @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite for 3d qp .",
    "thus we can say that the latter results confirm the common universality .",
    "the same is true of calculations using retarded green s function method@xcite , with resulting @xmath14 at @xmath15 , but for small system sizes @xmath16 and rather spread data .",
    "another paper of the same group@xcite reported lower @xmath17 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present another , tm based confirmation of the assumption , that anderson model and qp belong to the same universality class .",
    "let us recall the tight - binding hamiltonian :    @xmath18    where the first sum counts the @xmath19 lattice sites , the second sum goes over nearest neighbors and we set the hopping t@xmath20 , thus fixing the energy scale .",
    "the length scale is set by choosing the lattice constant @xmath21 . for a binary system the distribution of on - site",
    "energies @xmath22 has the form :    @xmath23    we prefer to use @xmath24 , the ratio of insulating atoms b , instead of often used @xmath25 because @xmath24 is the measure of disorder , induced among perfectly conducting a atoms .",
    "the quantum percolation model can be got either by removing appropriate t@xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) or by sending @xmath27 .",
    "the latter case is more simple for tm method , as we need all t@xmath20 in the transfer direction and it suits better for site percolation .",
    "thus we set the on - site energy for a - type atoms to @xmath28 and the one for the randomly positioned b - type atoms to a large number@xcite , typically @xmath29 .",
    "the prize one has to pay in numerical approach are ill - defined matrices and a non - zero , but very small tunelling conductance through @xmath30 sites with still finite barrier - though the latter disadvantage shows up only in deep insulators @xcite , behind the scope of this paper .    for anderson model the @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is continuous , e. g. box distribution from an interval of the width @xmath32 ( disorder ) : @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "it should be further mentioned , that both models are fully symmetric with respect to @xmath34 , thus we will restrict our investigation to one ( left ) half of the band :  @xmath35 .",
    "the classical site percolation threshold for simple cubic lattice is @xmath36 and it is known , that the quantum critical value @xmath37 for the whole mobility edge .",
    "the quantum wave requires a better highway than the narrow path of the percolation cluster backbone . up to now",
    "the maximum calculated value@xcite was @xmath38 , but we will show that the difference from @xmath39 is smaller .",
    "our numerical calculations are based on the usual transfer matrix method , described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the conductance @xmath40 in units @xmath41 is given by the landauer formula @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the @xmath44 transmission matrix , specifying the transmitted ( not reflected ) part of @xmath45 planar waves , entering the sample on the left and leaving it on the right .",
    "@xmath43 is extracted from a @xmath46 transfer matrix .",
    "it was mentioned above , that we have to do with ill - defined matrices , even more than within anderson model . in transfer matrix approach",
    "we deal rather with @xmath47 matrices and the precision of their small eigenvalues gets quickly lost - but we need them accurate , as they become important after recovering the @xmath43 matrix . an efficient way how to treat this problem was described in refs .   and ; we have to perform the renormalization procedure at least after each two tm multiplications , but then we are able to include larger samples up to @xmath48 .",
    "this is useful , as finite size effects turn out larger than for anderson model .",
    "the most numerically sensitive region is around the band center , i. e. for small @xmath49 , where we have to perform the procedure after each single tm multiplication@xcite .",
    "once we have the matrix @xmath50 , we can calculate also its eigenvalues @xmath51 , satisfying    @xmath52    where the positive quantities @xmath53 play similar role for cubic samples , as lyapunov exponents do in quasi-1d geometry .",
    "the smallest one is labeled @xmath54 .    in localized samples ,",
    "the landauer conductance decays quickly with sample size , @xmath55 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath56 diverges at critical point @xmath57 as @xmath58 for @xmath59 fixed and vice versa .",
    "the sps assumption implies one combined variable from @xmath60 or @xmath61 and in the vicinity of the mit point we expect @xmath62 .",
    "if we perform taylor expansion in @xmath63 variable and add some finite - size correction , we get    @xmath64 ^ 2\\bigr),\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is an irrelevant exponent and its term becomes negligible for large @xmath66 .",
    "analogous relations can be expected for @xmath67 , i. e. with the single variable @xmath68 and @xmath69 fixed .",
    "the conductance @xmath40 will be mostly an ensemble average @xmath70 , taken over many samples , typically 20.000 .",
    "it is known@xcite that many other quantities would fit eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , e. g. the geometric mean @xmath71 , @xmath72 , percentiles of the distribution of conductances @xmath73 , @xmath74 , current moments@xcite @xmath75 , inverse participation ratios@xcite , etc@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , quantities like @xmath76 or @xmath74 are more sensitive to numerical instabilities , especially for larger @xmath77 and @xmath66 or very small @xmath49 .",
    "it was shown@xcite , that the density of states ( dos ) has sharp peaks at special energies , @xmath78 these eigenvalues belong to submatrices of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , created by small islands of @xmath79 sites completely surrounded by @xmath30 sites , i. e. isolated from the rest .",
    "it was found , that @xmath40 can quickly fall down at these energies and they can influence the shape of mobility edge .    before going to main results , let us check our numerics in the vicinity of the special point @xmath80 .",
    "conductance @xmath40 should be @xmath81 independent for large enough @xmath81 .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , that for delocalized sample with @xmath82 , common upper line , this is true for @xmath83 even at @xmath80 . for a localized sample , all lower lines ,",
    "the value depends strongly on the energy @xmath2 close to the special @xmath80 , but still a plateau develops for larger @xmath81 .",
    "exception is the special point itself , where @xmath84 , in other words @xmath85 for @xmath27 .",
    "the same @xmath86 dependence is found for a test sample with one perpendicular square barrier of @xmath30 sites completely stopping the transport through otherwise perfect cube of @xmath79 sites ; thus this dependence is an unusual form of tunelling .",
    "the picture is qualitatively the same at @xmath87 , just for much lower disorder @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth mention , that in the latter case we surely do not have to do with simple quantum tunelling through closed finite samples@xcite ( closed in the sense of classical percolation , regardless of @xmath2 ) , as we chose samples with @xmath88 , far bellow @xmath39 .",
    "alternatively formulated , the same samples become metallic for larger @xmath49 .",
    "one can also see that the geometric mean of conductance tends to zero though the arithmetic @xmath70 remains positive at special points .",
    "we chose also @xmath89 and after some effort we found a localized sample of the type as in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] bottom lines , but the ratio of such specially localized samples becomes much lower than for @xmath90 .    the possible deep localization at special energies was explained in several ways . in ref .",
    "it was supposed , that the clusters of insulating atoms around conducting islands could have extremely large reflectivity at these energies .",
    "another explanation@xcite argued that localization on dead ends of the spanning cluster is strong at special energies .",
    "let us add yet another possibility .",
    "the dispersion law gives    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the wavenumber in transfer direction @xmath93 and the wavenumbers in perpendicular directions @xmath94 are quantized by hardwall boundary conditions .",
    "for special values of energies the whole vector ( @xmath95 ) can point in ( body ) diagonal direction and the planar wave is then fully reflected by insulating site , siting exactly in this direction .",
    "if all planar waves are fully reflected , the sample becomes deeply localized@xcite .",
    "summarizing , with @xmath96 , we always get correct @xmath40 for delocalized samples and also for medium localization .",
    "strongly localized samples require special attention .     vs. energy and ( b ) @xmath97 vs. disorder , both around the same mit point @xmath98.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( a )   vs. energy and ( b ) @xmath97 vs. disorder , both around the same mit point @xmath98.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( b )",
    "now let us find one critical point in detail .",
    "for @xmath99 most samples are metallic and @xmath100 , for @xmath101 most samples are localized and @xmath102 . at mit , @xmath40 becomes @xmath66 independent .",
    "we chose the value @xmath103 , and found @xmath104 from the crossing point in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2]a ) and [ fig : f2]b ) . as @xmath69 is far enough from @xmath39 , and @xmath59",
    "is not close to any important special value ( in the sense of relevant peaks in dos ) , we can use even the @xmath97 as order parameter .",
    "the data were fitted according to eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) and the resulting exponent is @xmath105 for the @xmath63 dependence and @xmath106 for the @xmath107 one , both in perfect accordance with @xmath4 .",
    "of course , taking @xmath108 instead of @xmath97 yields the same critical point and @xmath0 .",
    "having performed these calculations for almost two dozens of fixed energies , typically changing only @xmath24 , we can plot the mobility edge in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "some pairs of numerical values can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] . the point @xmath109 was added artificially - there are no open channels there .",
    "it was already mentioned above that the situation is mirror symmetric in @xmath110 , we do not plot the obvious interval @xmath111 .",
    "the upper border of the graph was set to the classical @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum value of our mit line is cca @xmath112 , greater than @xmath113 value reported before@xcite , but with smaller samples @xmath114 and @xmath16 , resp .     - independent crossing point of arithmetic mean @xmath115 at band center.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( a )   - independent crossing point of arithmetic mean @xmath115 at band center.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( b )    now we will compare our results to those of ref . .",
    "they introduced the local dos for each lattice site and then performed two averages at once ( in two manners ) .",
    "the first one was ensemble average as we do , the second one was averaging with respect to all sites .",
    "the two manners were geometric and arithmetic mean .",
    "at last they calculate the ratio of geometric / arithmetic mean and plot lines , where this order parameter is constant .",
    "the line entering the point @xmath109 compares very well with our mobility edge in fig . [",
    "fig : f3 ] , with their minimum at cca @xmath116 , i. e. our maximum at @xmath117 and a rather wide plateau around this maximum .",
    "the main difference is a discrete set of energies , where their order parameter and thus also the critical line drops to zero .",
    "but the only cases , where they could show this explicitly where integers @xmath118 . with irrational values like @xmath119 the localized case is hard to find numerically , as its region is extremely narrow in energies and also the corresponding peaks in dos are much smaller@xcite than those at three integer @xmath2 .",
    "hence we plot the detailed view of the band center in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](a ) , where both calculations of critical @xmath69 with the use of geometric and arithmetic mean of conductance @xmath40 are presented - of course only ensemble averaged .",
    "the critical disorder @xmath69 from calculations with geometric mean of @xmath40 is systematically somewhat larger outside the band center , but only by several percent - beware that the @xmath24 axis is not drawn to zero . for very small",
    "@xmath120 the @xmath69 from geometric mean already becomes slightly smaller than that from arithmetic mean and directly at @xmath87 it drops steeply to zero .",
    "it should be stressed out , that the decay of mit line at band center down to cca @xmath121 is independent of the type of averaging , it happens within a clearly non - zero interval of energies and it should be distinguished from extremely narrow drops of mit line to zero at special energies , present only with geometric averaging .",
    "similar relatively broad interval of energies , where the mobility edge should decay , was reported@xcite around @xmath122 . with arithmetic mean and @xmath123 ,",
    "we do not see it at all .",
    "we should also say that the standard mean dos , calculated up to @xmath124 , has clearly non - zero value for @xmath88 in the vicinity of the band center , apart from high central peak at @xmath87 . according to our calculations , only at cca @xmath125 the dos drops to zero for small @xmath49 and a gap opens for even larger @xmath24 .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 remains constant along the whole mobility edge line , just the error bars rise as we approach the borders of the band @xmath126 and @xmath87 . but even for @xmath127 and @xmath128 it was still @xmath129 .",
    "important exception is the point @xmath87 itself . only with geometric mean",
    ", it has @xmath130 , as suggested already in ref .  .",
    "one possible explanation is that single parameter scaling ( sps ) does not work here anymore .",
    "the argument is , that geometric mean of @xmath40 differs substantially from the arithmetic one .",
    "furthermore , if we insists on sps and arithmetic @xmath70 as order parameter , standard analysis of data from fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](b ) according to eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) yields @xmath121 at @xmath87 and @xmath131 with @xmath63 variable .",
    "we tried also to calculate @xmath0 with @xmath132 variable , but the @xmath133 dependences changed their slope below @xmath134 and the analysis was too unstable .",
    "it is improbable , that common universality would be broken at one spectral point , the @xmath0 from fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](b ) data smaller than @xmath4 could rather mean , that sps is broken at @xmath87 . but one can also argue , that finite size effects are so strong here , that even sample sizes up to @xmath48 are insufficient .",
    "this would be exceptional , though not completely excluded . in ref .",
    "the authors had similar problems with 3d anderson model at the band edge ( close to @xmath135 ) and explained them by insufficient available sample sizes .",
    "summarizing , we always get a well defined crossing point of mobility edge , where data become @xmath66-independent as they should at criticality , even for @xmath87 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4](b ) .",
    "just the slopes of the crossing lines behave non - universally in band center , at least for available system sizes .",
    "let us present mean critical values of several quantities , namely @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath139 we can roughly say that it is given mainly by the largest eigenvalue @xmath140 and after simple algebra @xmath141 , which is well fulfilled in fig .",
    "[ fig : f5 ] , of course only outside the band center . for small @xmath49",
    "we get @xmath142 as a sum of several important @xmath51 .",
    "it should be emphasized , that @xmath136 remains finite , but @xmath137 and @xmath138 diverge , as we approach @xmath143 , see comments to fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the divergence is given by a minority of fully localized samples with @xmath85 for @xmath27 , which do not really influence the arithmetically averaged @xmath144 .",
    "further we present several critical conductance distributions @xmath145 and @xmath146 along the mobility edge .",
    "the distribution at @xmath87 and @xmath147 was added for comparison , too .",
    "( a ) and @xmath148 ( b ) along the mit line.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( a )   ( a ) and @xmath148 ( b ) along the mit line.,title=\"fig : \" ]  ( b )    we do not plot critical distributions for @xmath149 which are mutually almost overlaying , because of similar @xmath69 .",
    "further we can see typical non - analyticity@xcite at @xmath150 or @xmath151 , if @xmath73 or @xmath152 , resp",
    ". , is already decaying there .",
    "the @xmath146 at @xmath153 and those with maximal @xmath69 look similar to @xmath146 of 3d anderson model , but they are not identical for any @xmath154 - the sps works separately inside the models , not universally .",
    "this is known also for anisotropic anderson models and those in other dimension than @xmath11 . even for the bifractal@xcite with the lowest @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    "the @xmath145 looked more gaussian than those in fig.[fig : f6](a ) on the right .",
    "this is connected with far larger @xmath157 of 3d qp compared to low - dimensional anderson model at criticality or to universal conductance fluctuations in metallic regime .",
    "let us shortly discuss the metallic regime .",
    "away from band center , say with @xmath158 , we found typical metallic behavior for medium disorder @xmath159 , i. e. @xmath73 practically gaussian , @xmath160 and var @xmath40 constant ( @xmath66 and @xmath24 independent ) , with values cca 10 percent above the theoretically predicted universal conductance fluctuations@xcite .",
    "even smaller @xmath24 brings traces of ballistic behavior , var  @xmath40 becomes system - size dependent ( rising with @xmath66 ) .",
    "contrary to these standard properties , at the band center @xmath87 we did not find typical metal for any @xmath24 and available @xmath66 .",
    "we still have @xmath160 , but now @xmath161 instead of reaching the universal constant and cca one order of magnitude greater - rather like the mentioned almost - ballistic behavior ( perfect ballistics would have @xmath162 ) . also @xmath73 is somewhat deformed , not gaussian . the transition from this behavior to standard metal at larger @xmath49 is continuous , var @xmath40 decays with rising @xmath49 . if this is only finite size effect , than it is again immense at band center .",
    "we already stated recently@xcite , that 2d quantum percolation problem and 2d anderson model belong to the same universality class , meaning that @xmath163 is lower critical dimension for both models and there is no mit in time reversal symmetry case . here",
    "we add the confirmation of common universality in 3d , implying identical critical exponent @xmath0 , which we have shown within numerical accuracy along the mobility edge , with possible exception of the conduction band center @xmath87 .",
    "another new result confirms equal @xmath0 when cutting the mobility edge ( mit line ) either in disorder or in energy direction .",
    "all these properties result from single parameter scaling hypothesis and they get lost at band center , where either the sps does not work anymore , or we face immense finite - size effects , that can not be overcome with system sizes up to @xmath48 .",
    "this statement is supported also by loosing many typical properties of metallic samples at band center . concerning the mobility edge",
    ", we found the maximum critical disorder @xmath69 slightly above 0.6 , which is more than @xmath164 reported before@xcite .",
    "the shape of the mobility edge at band center depends on the choice of order parameter . the arithmetically averaged @xmath108 ( commonly preferred ) gives clearly non - zero @xmath165 at @xmath87 , whereas the geometrical mean gives @xmath130 in accordance with other numerics@xcite and theory@xcite .",
    "we present a new alternative explanation of extremely low conductance for a minority of samples , which push the geometric mean to zero .",
    "it is based on the fact , that for special energies the wavevectors of incoming planar waves point in body diagonal directions and the waves can face exactly the insulating sites , followed by full reflection .",
    "the rational special energies @xmath118 , have clearly different arithmetic and geometric means and also the resulting @xmath69 .",
    "the irrational ones , e. g. @xmath166 , seem numerically almost insensitive of the type of averaging , as the samples with nearly zero conductance become very rare . but the rather steep descent of mobility edge at band center takes place at non - zero interval of energies with sps still working for both types of averaging and it should be distinguished from the extremely narrow regions at all special energies , apparent only for geometric mean of conductances .",
