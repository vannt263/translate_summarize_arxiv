    "the term allee effect refers to a certain process that leads to decreasing net population growth with decreasing density @xcite . in vase",
    "the growth rate becomes negative at low density , this monotone relationship results in the existence of a so - called allee threshold below which populations are at high risk of being driven toward extinction .",
    "this phenomenon may be due to various ecological factors : failure to locate mates , inbreeding depression , failure to satiate predators , lack of cooperative feeding , etc .",
    "research on this topic is copious and is reviewed in  @xcite but rigorous mathematical analyses of stochastic spatial models that include an allee effect are much more limited .    in the model proposed by borrello @xcite ,",
    "each site of the infinite regular lattice represents a patch that can host a local population , and a strong allee effect is included in the form of a varying individual death rate taking a larger value for local populations below some threshold .",
    "the model is used to show that , when only small flocks of individuals can migrate from patch to patch , the metapopulation goes extinct whereas survival is possible if large enough flocks of individuals can migrate .",
    "the author has also used the framework of interacting particle systems to study the consequence of an allee effect @xcite .",
    "his model is a modification of the averaging process that also includes a threshold : local populations below this threshold go extinct whereas local populations above this threshold expand to their carrying capacity , each at rate one . the key component in this work is the topology of the network of interactions rather than the size of the migrating flocks , and the analysis of the process starting from a single occupied patch on various graphs indicates that the probability of long - term survival of the metapopulation decreases to zero as the degree of the network of interactions increases to infinity .",
    "this result suggests that long range dispersal promotes extinction of metapopulations subject to a strong allee effect .",
    "the modeling approach of the present paper is somewhat different .",
    "the model we propose is a version of the contact process with sexual reproduction @xcite on a graph that includes two levels of interactions modeling metapopulations : individuals are produced within each patch at a rate proportional to the number of pairs of individuals in the patch rather than a rate simply proportional to the number of individuals in the patch .",
    "this birth mechanism ( sexual reproduction ) reflects the difficulty to locate mates in patches at low density , which has been identified by ecologists as one of the most common causes of allee effect .",
    "in particular , while the allee effect is forced into the model in the form of a threshold parameter in both @xcite , it is on the contrary naturally induced by the birth mechanism in the model considered in this paper .",
    "using block constructions and duality techniques together with large deviation estimates and martingale theory , the main objective is to study the survival probability of the process starting with a single fully occupied patch .",
    "for simplicity and to avoid complicated expressions later , we focus on the one - dimensional case , but all our results easily extend to higher dimensions . each integer @xmath0 represents a patch that can host a local population of up to @xmath1 individuals , and it is convenient to think of each site as a set of spatial locations that can be either empty or occupied by one individual . by convention , we use bold letters to denote these spatial locations : @xmath2 are the possible spatial locations at site / patch @xmath3 .",
    "the model we consider is a continuous - time markov chain whose state at time @xmath4 is a spatial configuration @xmath5 each individual dies at rate one . offspring produced at a given patch",
    "are sent to a spatial location chosen uniformly at random either from the parents patch or from a neighboring patch . in either case ,",
    "offspring are produced at a rate proportional to @xmath1 times the fraction of occupied pairs of spatial locations and the birth is suppressed if the target location is already occupied . the proportionality constant is denoted by @xmath6 for offspring sent within their parents patch and by @xmath7 for offspring sent outside their parents patch .",
    "sexual reproduction is modeled by the fact that the birth rate is related to the number of occupied pairs and the reason for multiplying by @xmath1 is to have births and deaths occurring at the same time scale . to define the dynamics more formally , we write @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dispersal range , and define the projection map @xmath10 for all @xmath11",

    "the analysis of the model  is more challenging . constructing the system graphically from a collection of independent poisson processes and using standard coupling arguments",

    "this model exhibits two possible regimes :    1 .   when @xmath31 , there is extinction : @xmath32 as time @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 , the polynomial @xmath35 has two nontrivial roots given by @xmath36 and the system is bistable : @xmath37 is unstable and @xmath38    model is probably the simplest model of population subject to a strong allee effect .",
    "it shows that the value @xmath39 is a critical value .",
    "at least when @xmath1 is large , which is the case of interest in ecology , our results for the stochastic spatial model reveal again different behaviors depending on whether the inner birth parameter @xmath6 and more generally the overall birth parameter @xmath40 is either larger or smaller than four .",
    "our first theorem gives explicit conditions on the two birth parameters for the metapopulation to survive with probability close to one when @xmath1 is large and offspring can only be sent to the two patches adjacent to the parents patch .    ",
    "[ th : survival ] assume that @xmath41 and that either @xmath42 then , there exists @xmath43 such that @xmath44    based on our simple analysis of , we conjecture that @xmath45 is a sufficient condition for the existence of a nontrivial invariant measure when @xmath1 is large , but we believe that this condition is not sufficient for the survival probability starting with a single occupied patch to be close to one .",
    "the reason is that only half of the offspring produced at the source patch are sent to a given adjacent patch so the value 8 can be understood literally as four times two adjacent patches . to comment on the second assumption , we note that the condition @xmath34 alone is not sufficient even for the existence of a nontrivial invariant measure since , in the absence of migrations , each local population is doomed to extinction .",
    "however , using the expression of the root @xmath46 to compute explicitly the bound in condition ( a2 ) , we find for instance that the theorem holds for the pairs @xmath47 indicating that the bound for @xmath7 decreases fast with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "we now focus on extinction results .",
    "conditions for extinction of the basic contact process can be easily found by comparing the process with a branching process .",
    "the same approach can be used to find conditions for extinction of the process with sexual reproduction and two levels of interactions . indeed , observing that , in patches with exactly  @xmath48 individuals , offspring are produced at rate @xmath49 we deduce that the number of individuals in the metapopulation is dominated stochastically by a simple birth and death process with birth parameter @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , there is almost sure extinction whenever @xmath23 .",
    "this condition , however , is far from being optimal for the contact process with sexual reproduction .",
    "indeed , the next theorem and the analysis of suggest that extinction occurs whenever @xmath51 , a condition that we believe to be optimal .",

    ". then , for all @xmath52 , there exists @xmath4 such that @xmath53    the proof is based on duality techniques , and more precisely the fact that the dual process of the microscopic model dies out almost surely when @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , the theorem holds even for the process starting from the all occupied configuration .",
    "note however that this result only suggests but does not imply extinction because it only holds for parameters @xmath1 that depend on time  @xmath4 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the survival probability of the somewhat complicated dual process can only be computed explicitly in the absence of collisions in the dual process which , in turn , can only be obtained in the limit as @xmath54 .",
    "our last theorem also looks at the extinction regime and is probably the most interesting one from an ecological perspective .",
    "it shows that , in contrast with our first result that identifies parameter regions in which survival occurs with probability arbitrarily close to one , regardless of the choice of the birth parameters , extinction occurs with probability close to one when the dispersal range @xmath9 is sufficiently large .

    ", the theorem shows that the survival probability decreases to zero as the dispersal range increases indicating that , though dispersal is necessary for expansion in space , long range dispersal promotes extinction of metapopulations subject to a strong allee effect caused by sexual reproduction .",
    "in particular , the effects of dispersal are opposite for the process with and without sexual reproduction since , in the presence of long range dispersal , the basic contact process approaches a branching process with critical values for survival significantly smaller than that of the process with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this section and the next section are devoted to the proof of theorem [ th : survival ] .",

    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th : range ] which shows in particular that , for any choice of the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 , the probability that the process starting with a single occupied patch survives tends to zero as the dispersal range tends to infinity .",
    "this together with theorem  [ th : survival ] suggests that dispersal promotes extinction of processes with sexual reproduction , whereas dispersal is known to promote survival of the basic contact process with no sexual reproduction .",
    "the proof relies on the following two key ingredients :    1 .   in the absence of migrations : @xmath208 , the process starting with a single fully occupied patch goes extinct almost surely in a finite time .",
    "this directly follows from the fact that , in this case , the process is irreducible and has a finite state space .",

    "we observe that the recursive relationship can be re - written as @xmath228 which has characteristic polynomial @xmath229 using in addition that @xmath230 since state 0 is absorbing , we get @xmath231 from which it follows that @xmath232 for @xmath224 . using  , we also deduce @xmath233 finally , combining with  , we get @xmath234 which completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath238 denote the number of individuals born at patch @xmath3 and then sent outside the patch before the patch goes extinct .",
    "the idea is to use the following conditioning : @xmath239 to estimate the first term in , we observe that , since offspring sent outside the patch land on a patch chosen uniformly at random from a set of @xmath240 patches , we have @xmath241 for all @xmath9 large . for the second term , we first use lemma  [ lem : range - extinction ] to get @xmath242 in particular ,                to prove theorem [ th : extinction ] , we return to the microscopic representation @xmath249 of the process that looks at the metapopulation at the individual level rather than at the patch level .",
    "the proof is based on duality techniques so the first step is to define a graphical representation to construct both the microscopic process and its dual process .",
    "recall that @xmath12 the graphical representation consists of three collections of poisson processes :    1 .   for each @xmath11 and each @xmath250",

    ", we also construct @xmath268 which allows to keep track of the state at @xmath269 based on the configuration at time @xmath270 .",
    "the dual process of the contact process with sexual reproduction consists of a collection of finite subsets of the set of sites @xmath271 that evolves based on the graphical representation as follows :    1 .",
    "the process starts from the singleton @xmath272 .",
    "* births * : if site @xmath273 where either @xmath274 then , for each set @xmath275 that contains @xmath16 , we add the set which is obtained from  @xmath276 by removing @xmath16 and adding its parents sites @xmath277 and @xmath278 , i.e. , @xmath279 3 .   * deaths * : if site @xmath273 where @xmath280 for some @xmath281 then we remove from the dual process all the sets that contain @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath282    we say that a * collision * occurs at dual time @xmath283 whenever @xmath284 in words , there is a collision whenever there is a birth @xmath285 while @xmath16 and at least one of its two parents @xmath277 and @xmath278 belong to the dual process . the dual process allows to deduce the state of site @xmath286 at time @xmath4 from the configuration at earlier times .",
    "more precisely , identifying the microscopic process with the set of occupied sites , the construction of the dual process implies the following duality relationship between the two processes : @xmath287 in view of , regardless of the initial configuration @xmath288 , @xmath289 which is the key to proving the theorem .",
    "the dual process of the contact process with sexual reproduction is a very complicated object and finding even rough conditions on the parameters of the system for almost sure extinction of the dual process is a challenging problem . in the absence of collision , however , the problem is simplified due to some events becoming independent .",
    "in particular , the next step is to show that the probability of a collision before a fixed dual time can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath1 sufficiently large , which is done in the following lemma .",
    "the basic idea is that the number of points @xmath292 added to the dual process in @xmath283 time units does not depend on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , the random variable @xmath292 is stochastically smaller than the number of particles at time @xmath283 in a branching process @xmath293 with no death and in which each particle gives birth to a pair of particles at rate @xmath40 therefore @xmath294 using markov s inequality further implies that @xmath295 since on the event that @xmath296 for all @xmath297 there are at most @xmath298 births and since at each birth the parents are from the set of all pairs among at least @xmath1 vertices , we also have @xmath299 combining ",
    ", we get @xmath300 which , taking @xmath301 , tends to zero as @xmath54 .     +   + returning to our key ingredient ,",
    "the next step is to prove almost sure extinction under the conditions of the theorem of a version of the dual process that excludes collisions .",

    "then we remove all the sets that contain @xmath315 , i.e. , @xmath318    the process evolves according to the exact same rules as the dual process except that at each birth event the parents are chosen uniformly at random in the unit interval rather than from a finite collection of neighbors . in particular , defining collisions as for the dual process , collisions now occur with probability zero , and it directly follows from the construction that @xmath319 both this process and the dual process are naturally defined only for @xmath320 but it is convenient to assume that all the poisson processes introduced above are also defined for negative times so that both processes are well defined for all @xmath321 .",
    "then , we say that @xmath322 and similarly for the dual process : @xmath323 due to the lack of collision and independence of some key events , the exact condition for  @xmath324 to die out with probability one can be found , which is done in the next lemma .",
    "the proof relies on three ingredients .",
    "first , due to symmetry , @xmath326 is constant across all the possible choices of the starting point .",
    "second , due to the absence of collision , the events that different space - time points live forever are independent : @xmath327 third , by construction of the process , for all @xmath328 , @xmath329 the lemma follows from  combined with a first - step analysis .",
    "the idea is to condition on whether the first event occurring at point @xmath330 before time @xmath4 is a birth or a death . the first time before time @xmath4 a birth or death occur at @xmath330 are given respectively by @xmath331 letting @xmath332 , we have @xmath333 where points @xmath334 and @xmath335 are the parents of point @xmath330 at dual time @xmath336 .",
