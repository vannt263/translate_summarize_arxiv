    "the discovery of the hat - p-13 by @xcite elicited substantial interest . the transiting extrasolar planet",
    "( tep ) hat - p-13b and its host star hat - p-13a are rather typical examples of these objects , with two exceptions .",
    "firstly , the star is the second - most metal - rich known to host a tep after xo-2ajkt / tepcat/ ] @xcite ( but see the discussion on host star @xmath9 $ ]  values in @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , there is a third component in the system which is clearly detected in the radial velocity measurements ( rvs ) of the host star @xcite .",
    "hat - p-13c has an orbit with a period of @xmath10d , an eccentricity of @xmath11 and a minimum mass of @xmath12@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this object is expected to induce transit timing variations ( ttvs ) within the hat - p-13a , b system , which potentially allow the structure of the planet to be probed @xcite .",
    "hat - p-13 is unfortunately not the best system for such analyses , as its relatively long and shallow transits are not conducive to precise timing measurements .",
    "an observation of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect by @xcite has shown that the projected angle between the orbital axis of hat - p-13b and the rotational axis of the parent star is consistent with zero .",
    "this is in line with the fact that misaligned axes are only found for tep systems containing a star hotter than roughly 6250k @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found a long - term drift in the radial velocity measurements of the star , which may be the signature of a _ fourth _ component to the system on an orbit of much longer period .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the two timings from @xcite both deviate from the orbital ephemeris above , being later by 8.6@xmath13 and 3.2@xmath13 .",
    "our own analyses of these data return timings which are similarly distant from expectations .",
    "a detailed reanalysis of the corresponding data performed by @xcite resulted in a timing for the second of these transits which conflicts less with a linear ephemeris ( 1.6@xmath13 ) .",
    "the discrepancy of the first transit remains unexplained .",
    "a few of the amateur timings are late by a similar amount to this one , but with much larger errorbars .",
    "we conclude that the available data do not provide a clear indication of the existence of ttvs , primarily on the basis that we can not conceive of a reasonable ttv function which is a significant improvement over a linear ephemeris .",
    "the transits which occur later than predicted by our ephemeris are not grouped together , but are interleaved with ones which happen at the expected times .",
    "an explanation involving ttvs therefore would require a highly contrived functional form .",
    "so where did the previous suggestions of ttvs come from ?",
    "@xcite used an earlier ephemeris , tuned on the @xcite and @xcite observations , to show that their transit timings were earlier than expected .",
    "the dotted line in fig.[fig : minima ] represents this ephemeris and shows that it fails to match the more recent transit timings .",
    "@xcite suggested that a sinusoidal ttv of amplitude 0.005d and period 1150d was in good correspondance with the observations , as demonstrated by their fig.2 .",
    "we have endeavoured to place this periodic variation , whose parameters were not fully specified , onto fig.[fig : minima ] , with a little manual fine - tuning .",
    "the 2009 - 10 transit timings obtained by @xcite clearly dismiss the sinusoidal ttv proposed by @xcite , leaving a linear ephemeris as the only reasonable option .",
    "several sets of information exist from which the properties of the hat - p-13a , b system can be derived .",
    "analysis of the available light curves has given values for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the high - precision radial velocities procured by @xcite and @xcite supply measurements of the velocity amplitude of the star ( @xmath18ms@xmath19 ) and the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "analysis of the spectra by @xcite furthermore lead to estimates of the stellar effective temperature ( @xmath21k ) and metallicity ( @xmath22}}= + 0.41 \\pm 0.08 $ ] ) .",
    "finally , constraints on the properties of the star can be obtained by interpolation within tabulated predictions from stellar evolutionary models .",
    "our solution process @xcite consists of finding the best agreement between the observed and model - predicted @xmath23s , and the measured @xmath16 and calculated @xmath24 .",
    "this is done using the velocity amplitude of the planet , @xmath25 , as a solution control parameter and calculating the full system properties using standard formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the system properties comprise the mass , radius , surface gravity and mean density for the star ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and planet ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , the orbital semimajor axis ( @xmath34 ) , the planetary equilibrium temperature and @xcite number ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and an estimate of the evolutionary age of the star .",
    "the statistical errors on the resulting values are calculated using a perturbation analysis @xcite which yields a full error budget for each output quantity .",
    "the use of theoretical models incurs a dependence on stellar theory which is assessed by running separate solutions with each of five different sets of model tabulations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , an alternative empirical estimate of the physical properties is obtained using a calibration @xcite based on eclipsing binary star systems , inspired by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the control parameter @xmath25 represents the constraints obtained from stellar theory .",
    "note that the values @xmath32 , @xmath29 and @xmath35  are not reliant on constraints from stellar theory @xcite .",
    "the sets of physical properties arising from each of the five stellar model tabulations and from the empirical calibration are given in tablea11 .",
    "for the final results in table[tab : hatp13:final ] we adopted the unweighted mean of each parameter from the solutions for the five stellar models .",
    "the statistical error is the largest of the individal errorbars , and the systematic error is the standard deviation of the five values .",
    "compared to previous studies , we find a larger and more evolved star and a correspondingly slightly more massive but significantly bigger and hotter planet .",
    "the extensive photometric dataset considered in this work leads to more precise measurements of the physical properties , but the uncertainties in @xmath16 and @xmath17 continue to dominate the error budget .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath26 stems mainly from that in @xmath9 $ ] , suggesting that a new spectral synthesis study would also be useful in improving our understanding of the hat - p-13 system .",
    "the hat - p-13 system is unusual in that a transiting hot jupiter and its host star are accompanied by a clearly - detected third component on a wider orbit .",
    "such a configuration should result in hat - p-13c inducing ttvs within the hat - p-13a , b system , which may be detectable within a comparatively short time period .",
    "this possibility has generated substantial interest , resulting in a large body of photometric observations covering many transits of the star by the inner planet .",
    "we have assembled the available transit timing measurements and shown that they are most easily explained by a linear ephemeris , albeit with a small number of values which occur later than expected .",
    "the discrepant measurements are not clumped together , so could only be explained via highly complex functional forms .",
    "previous claims of ttvs can be attributed to small - number statistics , although continued photometric monitoring has a good chance of turning up something interesting in the future .",
    "we have presented new observations of four transits , obtained using telescope defocussing techniques . including previously published data , we have ten good sets of transit light curves .",
    "these were each analysed within the context of our _ homogeneous studies _",
    "project @xcite , and a good agreement between the results was found .",
    "we combined them with the measured spectroscopic properties of the host star and several sets of theoretical stellar model predictions to find the physical properties of the system .",
    "hat - p-13 is now well - characterised , although additional photometric and spectroscopic measurements would allow further improvement .",
    "we have included it in the tepcat cataloguejkt / tepcat/ ] of the physical properties of transiting planetary systems .",
    "we find a significantly different set of physical properties compared to previous studies , which had access to only two of the ten photometric datasets used here .",
    "the star is more massive , larger and more evolved .",
    "the planet , whose properties are measured relative to its host star , is similarly heavier and bigger . its lower density and higher equilibrium temperature place it firmly in the ` pm ' class advocated by @xcite .",
    "its radius is too large to match the values predicted by the models of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the radius anomaly ( the measured radius of a tep versus that predicted by theoretical models ) is correlated with equilibrium temperature , and possibly inversely correlated with host star @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the large radius anomaly and high equilibrium temperature of hat - p-13b corroborate the former observation , but the highly metal - rich nature of the parent star ( @xmath22}}= 0.41 \\pm 0.08 $ ] ) is contrary to the latter suggestion .",
    "the reduced light curves presented in this work will be made available at the cds ( http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ ) and at http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/@xmath37jkt/. this observational campaign has been possible thanks to the generous allocation of telescope time by the tac of the bologna observatory and to the invaluable help of the technical staff .",
    "js acknowledges financial support from stfc in the form of an advanced fellowship .",
    "we thank andras pl for supplying photometric data and the anonymous referee for insightful comments .",
