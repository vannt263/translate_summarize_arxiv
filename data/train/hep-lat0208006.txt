    "finite density qcd has attracted much attention recently : we are expecting that qcd has a rich structure when we add a density or chemical potential axis in parameter space .",
    "the finite temperature deconfinement transition line starts at @xmath3 , which might be a cross - over accompanied by a tri - critical point at finite @xmath4 . at high @xmath4 and relatively low temperature",
    ", there would be a new form of matter such as color superconductive phase , or color - flavor locking phase , which are speculated by mainly perturbative calculations @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative study of the finite density qcd by lattice simulations is highly required , but because of the famous difficulty , the direct monte carlo simulation of su(3 ) system is very difficult .",
    "many approaches have been reported , @xcite , and yet , no reliable algorithm is known to investigate color su(3 ) qcd at low temperature with large chemical potential .",
    "color - su(2 ) is currently the unique model by which we can study these regions non - perturbatively .",
    "after the first trial of the calculation@xcite , there had been no work during many years . because of the recent rapid progress of theoretical understanding of the system @xcite , however , the calculation has been activated @xcite .    in this report , we study the finite density qcd by wilson fermions .",
    "we investigate the phase structure in @xmath0-plane for iwasaki improved - gauge action . in order to take account of the fermion determinant",
    ", we use an algorithm in which the ratio of the determinant is evaluated explicitly at each metropolis update process @xcite .",
    "in fig.[fig - pol ] , we show the average of polyakov line in @xmath0-plane at @xmath5 .",
    "we evaluate also baryon number density , gluon energy density and polyakov line susceptibility , and especially from the peak of the polyakov line susceptibility we can determine the confinement / deconfinement phase transition regions . in both bounday conditions ,",
    "the behaviors of these quantities are essentially the same @xcite .",
    "we study several cases by varying lattice size ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the boundary conditions and the number of flavor ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "calculations become unstable and break down at large chemical potential regions@xcite . in such cases",
    ", negative determinant appears for @xmath10 .",
    "we calculate meson and di - quark propagators in pseudo - scalar and vector channels .",
    "we find that @xmath11 meson mass drops as @xmath4 reaches to the critical region . in order to confirm this unexpected result ,",
    "we calculate both periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions and several @xmath12 s ( @xmath13 ) . in fig.[fig - mass160p ] we show @xmath14 and @xmath11 masses as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath15 ( periodic boundary condition ) .",
    "although our statistic is not enough to extrapolate them to the chiral limit , the signal of the anomalous behavior of the vector channel is clearly seen .    at @xmath3 , because of the qcd inequality @xcite , the pseudo - scalar channel has the lightest mass , but there is no such a condition for the finite density state .",
    "indeed there are several conjectures in literatures @xcite .",
    "if our result shown in fig.[fig - mass160p ] is not a special feature of the color su(2 ) model , this is the first lattice observation of the drop of the vector meson mass which may play an important role in the phenomenological analyses on large low - mass lepton - pair enhancement measured in ceres @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the vector meson channel is mixed with the vector diquark one , @xmath16 , at high @xmath4 and their masses are distorted/@xmath16 mixing . ] . in this case",
    ", we can study  meson \" and  diquark \" mixing in color su(2 ) qcd .",
    "in the previous section , we show that the vector meson may have a peculiar behavior at finite density . above @xmath1 at low temperature , the condensation of @xmath2 may occur .",
    "we need tools to understand the vacuum structure numerically .    from polyakov line correlations , color",
    "average heavy quark potential is calculated .",
    "one can also obtain color singlet ( @xmath18 ) and triplet potential ( @xmath19 ) for @xmath20 system : @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "color symmetric ( @xmath22 ) and anti - symmetric ( @xmath23 ) potential for @xmath2 system can be also evaluated : @xmath24 . in color su(2 ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 even at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore if there would exist difference between @xmath2 and @xmath20 states , it should originate in dirac structure .    in fig.[fig - v1",
    "] , we plot preliminary data of color singlet potential .",
    "the rotational invariance is good by virtue of the renormalization group improved gauge action .",
    "the singlet ( triplet ) potential is attractive ( repulsive ) and the forces become weaker as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we fix the gauge in lorentz gauge for the color - dependent force and gluon propagators discussed in the following .",
    "we study gluon propagators as a tool to investigate the finite density qcd , @xmath28 we set the momenta as @xmath29 .",
    "the electric and magnetic parts of the propagator , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are expected to behave as , @xmath32 when the system is screened at the finite temperature and/or finite density , the screening effects should appear as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being electric and magnetic masses of the gluons , respectively . at @xmath37 and @xmath3",
    "the screening is infinite and the propagators vanish at long distance @xcite .",
    "we show in fig.[fig - gyy ] a preliminary result for @xmath38 . as @xmath4 increases",
    ", the screening becomes weaker , i.e. , the system shows the deconfinement feature , but at @xmath39 the propagator at long range seems to drop .",
    "it is an urgent future task to confirm the phenomena , because it could be an indication of a new phase at large @xmath4 .    * acknowledgment * this work is partially supported by grant - in - aide for scientific research by monbu - kagaku - sho ( no.11440080 and no .",
