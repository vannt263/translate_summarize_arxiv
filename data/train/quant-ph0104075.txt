    "the subject of two party quantum cryptography has had many twists and turns and until now security was proven only for very weak tasks like quantum gambling @xcite and cheat sensitive bit commitment @xcite , @xcite , while many two party tasks such as bit commitment @xcite , @xcite , ideal coin tossing @xcite and secure two party computations  @xcite were proven insecure .",
    "recently , however , mayers , salvail and chiba - kohno @xcite suggested a protocol , called thereafter msc(99 ) .",
    "they claimed this protocol may achieve unconditionally secure non - ideal coin tossing .",
    "_ coin tossing _ is a task in which two remote distrustfull parties conventionally called alice and bob run a protocol that , in the case that both parties act honestly , has equal probability to give the result 1 or 0 .",
    "the protocol has another result _ abort _ which is not obtained when both parties act honestly ( except with a possibly arbitrarily small probability ) .",
    "therefore when _ abort _ is obtained the interpretation of an honest player is that the other party deviated from the protocol . a protocol that satisfies the above conditions",
    "is called _",
    "correct_.    let @xmath0 where @xmath1 ) be the probability that the result @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "non - ideal exact coin tossing protocol _ is called _ secure _ if , in the case that one of the parties cheats , ( i.e. deviates from the given protocol ) the following condition : @xmath3 , is satisfied . a _",
    "non - ideal non - exact coin tossing protocol _ is called _ secure _ if , in the case that one of the parties cheats , the following requirement is satisfied : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a security parameter that can be made arbitrarily small .    the idea behind msc(99 ) , which is a _ non - ideal non - exact coin tossing protocol _ , is to build a protocol where both parties have almost no information , on the completely random output at first .",
    "as the protocol proceeds , they get in a slow and almost symmetric way more and more information about the result , until both have full information on the output .",
    "such a protocol is supposed to overcome the generalized attacks used against quantum bit commitment since , although at first a cheater can change the result without being detected , he has no information about the result and therefore any change would be useless .",
    "while at the end of the protocol , a cheater may have information about the protocol s result but it will be almost impossible for him to change the result undetected . in this letter",
    "we will analyze the information flow in msc(99 ) and suggest an attack on msc(99 ) in which the cheater acts honestly on the quantum level ( keeps everything possible in a superposition ) until he can obtain enough ( but not to much ) information about the protocol s result .",
    "he then makes the measurement and causes the superposition to `` collapse '' according to the information he obtains and his desired result .",
    "this attack is a generalization of the standard attacks on quantum bit commitment and can be carried out by any participant as long as the protocol is symmetric .",
    "this attack on msc(99 ) creates a non negligible bias on the protocol s output that is independent of the parameters of the protocol and therefore shows that the protocol is insecure .",
    "in what follows will shall use the following results from quantum information theory . given a quantum system",
    "whose density matrix is , with equal probability , one of two possible density matrices @xmath6 and asked to decide which one we were given , the measurement that minimizes the error probability of the decision is a measurement of the observable @xmath7 and the probability of error is : @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "another important quantity is the kolmogorov distance , which is defined in the following way : @xmath9 where the maximization is done over all possible povm s .",
    "the connection between these two quantities is the following : @xmath10 this shows that the measurements that optimizes k and pe ( which we call @xmath11 ) are identical . therefore the kolmogorov distance quantifies the deviation from a random guess giving it a well defined operational meaning , .",
    "the transition probability of two density matrices @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are purifications of @xmath12 and the maximization runs over all possible purifications of @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we can fix the purification of one density matrix and do the maximization over all purifications of the other @xcite . since different purifications of a density matrix in @xmath16",
    "are related by unitary transformations on @xmath17 the maximum can be obtained by maximizing over unitary transformations on @xmath18 or @xmath19 in @xmath17 alone .",
    "another important quantity is the fidelity of two density matrices which is defined by : @xmath20 where we minimize over all possible povm s .",
