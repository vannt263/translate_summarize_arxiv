    "there exist many mechanisms of particle production , nucleon and fragment emission in nuclear collisions at ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "they can be divided into the following ample categories .",
    "the first category contains collisions with direct nuclear overlap .",
    "in addition to nucleon - nucleon or parton - parton collisions , which are the most obvious sources of secondary hadrons , collective mechanisms were considered for baryon - antibaryon pair  @xcite or dilepton  @xcite production . the second category deals with `` distant '' electromagnetic collisions without nuclear overlap .",
    "in such a situation the interaction can be treated in terms of virtual photons emitted by one nucleus and absorbed by another collision partner . a subsequent photonuclear ( @xmath3 ) reaction leads to a so - called electromagnetic dissociation ( ed ) of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the virtual photon flux and consequently the rate of such @xmath3 events is proportional to @xmath4 , where z is the charge of the first nucleus .",
    "the ed process is widely used for studying the properties of giant resonances ( gr ) in nuclei , including multiphonon excitations  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the description of nuclear photoabsorption was extended to the photon energies much above the gr region , where the exitation of individual nucleons and multiple pion production become important .",
    "the model of electromagnetic dissociation processes taking into account these high - energy photon absorption channels was constructed in ref .",
    "according to this model , the fast hadrons produced after the photon absorption initiate a cascade of subsequent collisions with the intranuclear nucleons leading to the heating of a residual nucleus . at a later stage the nucleus undergoes de - excitation by means of the evaporation of nucleons and lightest fragments , binary fission or multifragmentation .",
    "the latter process takes place when the excitation energy is comparable with the total binding energy of a residual nucleus  @xcite .",
    "another interesting mechanism in the second category is the photon - photon collision or @xmath0 fusion leading to the particle production at mid - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the rate of these processes is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the effective @xmath0 luminosity at the lhc collider is expected to be comparable with that at a possible future photon linear collider  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the processes of the second category have attracted a special attention in the last few years .",
    "this interest is generated by the construction of the new heavy - ion colliders : rhic at brookhaven ( @xmath6 with @xmath7 gev ) and lhc at cern ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 gev ) .",
    "it is expected that the ed processes will play an important role for these energies and especially for the ions with high @xmath10 , due to the above - mentioned @xmath4-dependence .",
    "the predicted cross section for the electromagnetic dissociation at lhc , @xmath11 , is so large ( @xmath12 b ) that together with the electron capture process ( @xmath13 b ) , it will reduce significantly the life time of relativistic heavy - ion beams  @xcite as compared with the proton ones .",
    "the ed reaction rate at lhc is expected to be 30 times higher than that for the nuclear interactions ( @xmath14 b ) .",
    "but of course the ed reactions are much less violent then the nuclear ones .",
    "hadron production in photon - photon and photon - pomeron collisions , as well as in double - pomeron exchange were studied in ref .",
    "all these reactions are characterised by a large rapidity gap separating the remnants of the colliding hadrons or heavy ions from the particles produced in the central rapidity region .",
    "high - mass diffraction reactions were simulated by means of the monte - carlo event generator phojet  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no `` ready - to - use '' event generators for simulating relatively `` soft '' @xmath3 processes , where nuclear degrees of freedom play an important role . in particular , such simulations are needed for estimating the probabilities of different disintegration channels of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the properties of the ed processes have to be well understood in order to distinguish them from very peripheral nuclear collisions .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the whole set of mechanisms of coulomb excitation and subsequent dissociation of relativistic heavy - ions ( rhi ) . in sec.2",
    "the model is presented and compared with existing experimental data on few neutron removal from au and pb nuclei by virtual and real photons . in sec.3",
    "we discuss the ed processes which are expected to be important at the future heavy - ion colliders , rhic and lhc .",
    "we present the model predictions for multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions of neutrons .",
    "these results are important for designing zero - degree calorimeters for beam luminosity monitoring .",
    "rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons , fission products and intermediate mass fragments are also discussed in sec.3 .",
    "sec.4 is reserved for discussion and conclusions .",
    "let us consider the coulomb excitation of an ultrarelativistic projectile . according to the weizscker - williams ( ww ) method the spectrum of virtual photons from a stationary target of charge @xmath17 as seen by a projectile moving with velocity @xmath18 at impact parameter @xmath19",
    "is expressed as  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fine structure constant , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the modified bessel functions of zero and first order , @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth noting that the distribution ( [ eq:1 ] ) is written in the projectile rest frame .",
    "this means that for colliding beams one should use the lorentz factor of one collision partner in the rest frame of another partner , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lorentz factor of each beam .",
    "the projectile can be exited by absorbing one or more virtual photons .",
    "multiple excitations of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) up to the fourth order were considered in refs .  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath27-order cross section behaves approximately as @xmath28 , one should expect the maximum effect for the excitation of @xmath29 projectile in the field of @xmath29 target at ultrarelativistic energies . as was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , even in this case the cross sections of the third and fourth order processes are quite small in comparison with that for the second order excitation : @xmath30 and @xmath31 . thus we restrict our consideration by the first and second order processes .",
    "the mean number of photons absorbed by the projectile of mass @xmath32 in a collision at impact parameter @xmath19 is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the appropriate photoabsorption cross section , either measured for this projectile nucleus with real photons or calculated within a model . for the cases of interest ,",
    "i.e. for au and pb nuclei , we use the data set published in refs .",
    "@xcite , including a most recent one  @xcite where corresponding photoabsorption cross sections were measured . in the gdr region",
    "one can use a set of lorentz - line approximations given in the review  @xcite . according to prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the photoabsorption cross sections obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for au and pb nuclei are rescaled by factors 0.93 and 1.22 , respectively .",
    "following llope and braun - munzinger  @xcite we assume that at an impact parameter @xmath19 the probability of the multi - photon absorption is given by the poisson distribution with the mean multiplicity @xmath35 defined by eq .",

    "the integration over the photon energy starts from @xmath52 mev which corresponds to the threshold of nuclear dissociation in photonuclear reactions . due to the long - range nature of the electromagnetic forces",
    ", numerical calculations of the integrals  ( [ eq:11 ] ) and  ( [ eq:12 ] ) should be undertaken with care .",
    "a reasonable accuracy can be obtained if one splits the whole region of integration into two intervals : @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is determined by the condition @xmath56 which allows one to omit the exponential factor in the second interval .",
    "after that the first integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is calculated numerically , while the second one can be evaluated analytically , leading to a well - known expression  @xcite . the same splitting can be made in the integral  ( [ eq:12 ] ) . using the asymptotic behaviour at @xmath57 : @xmath58 one obtains the exponential integral which can be found in mathematical tables . with the described method",
    "one can avoid problems with too many nodes in the numerical integration over the wide range of impact parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 for branching ratios of partial channels of photonuclear dissociation induced by real and virtual photons were calculated within the model of ref .",
    "@xcite which takes into account the fast cascade stage of the reaction as well as evaporation , fission and multifragmentation processes for a residual nucleus .",
    "relative probabilities of the de - excitation processes are determined by the excitation energy @xmath61 of a residual nucleus formed after the completion of the fast cascade stage of the photonuclear reaction . in the following we consider step - by - step all these mechanisms with a special attention to the amount of energy which is transformed on average into the internal excitation of the nucleus .",
    "depending on the virtual photon energy @xmath62 different processes may contribute to the energy deposition .",
    "when a nucleus absorbs one or two virtual photons in the gr region , @xmath63 mev , their energies are completely transformed into the excitation energy @xmath61 .",
    "for preactinide nuclei like @xmath64 and @xmath65 , whose fission thresholds are about 30 mev , the de - excitation proceeds mainly through the evaporation of neutrons , since their separation energies are only around 7 mev . due to a high coulomb barrier in heavy nuclei , the proton emission is suppressed in the gr region . a detailed experimental investigation of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 reactions on @xmath70 and @xmath71 nuclei in the gr region was performed in ref .",
    "the presence of the reaction @xmath69 means that a nucleus has received @xmath61 up to 30 mev . for simulating the particle emission in the evaporation process we used the standard weisskopf evaporation scheme  @xcite with the assumption @xmath72 .",
    "starting from @xmath73 30 mev , where the quasideuteron mechanism becomes important and up to the single pion production threshold at @xmath74 mev , only a part of the photon energy is converted on average into the excitation energy @xmath61 of the compound nucleus .",
    "the rest of the photon energy is taken away by the fast nucleons originating from the absorbing pair .",
    "the energy deposition is simulated by the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the two - nucleon absorption cross section of a photon on a heavy nucleus , @xmath75 , is taken from the quasideuteron model of ref .",

    "the angular distribution of nucleons in the reaction @xmath78 was approximated in accordance with empirical fits from ref .",
    "although the cross section @xmath81 decreases strongly with the photon energy , the two - nucleon absorption mechanism competes noticeably with the single - nucleon photoabsorption channel up to @xmath820.5 gev .    as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , up to 12 neutrons can be emitted by photo - excited @xmath65 nucleus .",

    "the fissility @xmath86 of @xmath70 and @xmath71 nuclei becomes noticeable ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively ) , so one should expect the evaporation - fission competition .    above the single pion production threshold at @xmath74",
    "mev the @xmath89-isobar excitation of individual nucleons dominates .",
    "an interesting effect was noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite . near the threshold",
    "a slow pion has a small interaction cross section with nucleons and therefore , has a high probability to carry away a large part ( @xmath90 ) of the photon energy . only at @xmath91 mev",
    "the average value @xmath84 starts to increase again . during the fast cascade stage the initial nucleus looses on average 1 - 2 nucleons and acquires the excitation energy @xmath92 mev , which is sufficient for evaporation of many neutrons or fission .",
    "the evaporation may take place before of after the fission . in some cases",
    "fission fragments evaporate neutrons as well .    above the two - pion production threshold at @xmath93",
    "mev the photon - nucleon ( @xmath94 ) interaction becomes more complicated because of many possible final states .",
    "below we use a phenomenological model for exclusive description of the @xmath94-interaction developed in ref .",
    "the model includes both the resonance contribution from the two - body channels , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 being baryon and meson resonances ) , and the non - resonant statistical contribution from the multi - body channels @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "subsequently , the fast hadrons produced in a primary @xmath94-interaction initiate a cascade of successive hadron - nucleon collisions inside the nucleus .",
    "finally , when the photon energy reaches the value of several gev , the multiple pion production becomes the main process .",
    "a large number ( @xmath101 ) of many - body subchannels is included in the calculation .",
    "[ fig:0 ] shows the fraction of @xmath62 that on average is transformed into @xmath61 as well as average values of @xmath61 per nucleon of residual nucleus . as it was deduced from the experimental data  @xcite , @xmath102 mev for photoabsorption on lead at @xmath103 mev .",
    "this value agrees well with the prediction of our model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:0]a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:0]a one can see the above - mentioned decrease of @xmath104 above @xmath105 mev . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , when the virtual photon energy grows from the gr region to several gev , the nature of the coulomb excitation changes from the collective nuclear degrees of freedom to the excitation of a single nucleon inside the nucleus . in the latter case up to 95% of the photon energy",
    "is released in the form of fast particles leaving the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining energy deposited in the residual nucleus is sufficient for evaporating many neutrons .",
    "the moments of the neutron multiplicity distribution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , parts c and d. calculated moments are in a satisfactory agreement with the experimental values for the real photon absorption on pb nucleus  @xcite . below we use the same model for the case of the virtual photon absorption in electromagnetic interactions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions .",
    "it should be stressed however , that fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] shows only the average values , while a part of the interactions initiated by `` hard '' photons will lead to a stronger heating of the nucleus by a multi - pion system .",
    "this phenomenon was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite were it was shown that the yield of events with high excitation energy , resulting in the multifragment break - up of residual nuclei , might be quite sizable , up to @xmath106 of the total ed cross section .",
    "these events can be easily observed with properly designed forward - angle detectors at rhic and lhc colliders .    to include all the processes described above",
    "we have developed a specialized computer code reldis aimed at the monte carlo simulation of the relativistic electromagnetic dissociation of nuclei .",
    "the simulation begins with generating the single or double - photon absorption process .",
    "then the intranuclear cascade model is used to calculate the fast particle emission and the characteristics of residual nuclei .",
    "finally the de - excitation of thermalized residual nuclei is simulated according to the statistical model @xcite .",
    "let us consider now how the calculations based on weizscker - williams ( ww ) method describe the measured  @xcite cross sections of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 removal from @xmath110 nuclei excited electromagnetically .",
    "the branching ratios , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for partial channels of a photonuclear reaction are important ingredients of such calculations .",
    "the information concerning these ratios can be obtained from experiments with real photons  @xcite or from models of photonuclear reactions analogous to the one used in the present paper .",
    "we review in brief the advantages and disadvantages of both these approaches .",
    "the calculations  @xcite within the framework of ww method , which include both isoscalar and isovector quadrupole excitations as well as multiphonon states , describe the one - neutron emission data fairly well .",
    "using the harmonic - oscillator model one can derive a poisson distribution for the excitation probabilities of multiphonon states . on the contrary ,",
    "even the theory with these additional modifications is not able to describe the @xmath108 removal cross section .",
    "the measured cross section is twice as large as the calculated value , which is determined mainly by the probability of the double - phonon excitation .",
    "further modifications of the ww method , using a `` soft - spheres '' model and including nuclear - plus - coulomb processes  @xcite , do not remove the discrepancy .",
    "the description of the reaction mechanism within the coupled - channel approach  @xcite with proper account for the nuclear interaction is not able to improve the situation . only the inclusion of anharmonicities in the internal hamiltonian and nonlinear terms in the external field , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and later supported by other authors  @xcite , help to solve the problem . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a small deviation from the harmonic model may lead to a doubling of the two - phonon excitation probability and to a good description of the data .    the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite are based on the one- and two - neutron emission cross sections measured in experiments with real photons .",
    "thus only a limited number of channels of electromagnetic dissociation was considered .",
    "the differences in the total gdr cross section measured by different groups are found to be on the level of 20%  @xcite .",
    "there exists also an opinion  @xcite that for the @xmath108 photoemission measurements the quality of the data is even much worse .",
    "different interpretations of the photonuclear data lead to difficulties in determining the contribution of the double - photon absorption .",
    "indeed , the double gdr state may decay via @xmath108 and @xmath109 channels and therefore its admixture depends on the corresponding partial cross sections .    in the present paper we analyse the ed data  @xcite within the model of photonuclear reactions introduced above .",
    "we _ do not use _ experimental data as an input for calculations , except of the information concerning the non - statistical contribution in the @xmath107 emission channel .",
    "it should be reminded , that the statistical decay of the compound nucleus is not the only mechanism responsible for the decay of the collective gdr state .",
    "this state can also decay directly into a free nucleon and a hole in the residual nucleus , due to the two - body residual interaction in the final state ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "such a direct neutron emission leaves the residual nucleus in a low - lying energy state where only a subsequent emission of photons is possible .",
    "this makes the emission of a second neutron impossible , leading to a suppression of the @xmath67 channel in comparison with the pure statistical decay .",
    "we include this additional non - statistical contribution in the @xmath66 channel on the basis of the experimental information concerning this decay mode .",
    "the total fraction of the non - statistical contribution was evaluated to about @xmath111 and @xmath112 for au and pb nuclei , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we use these values in our simulations .",
    "the emission angles of non - statistical fast photoneutrons were generated according to the angular distributions measured in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our model of photonuclear reactions , implemented in the reldis code",
    ", we consider all possible decay modes , including binary fission and multifragmentation .",
    "it gives the yields and spectra of different particles in the ed reactions induced by real and virtual photons . before discussing the predictions in the remaining part of the paper ,",
    "let us consider first how the model describes the existing data on a few neutron removal from au nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the results for the few - nucleon emission are summarized in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "one can see that the model describes the @xmath109 emission quite well but the agreement with the measured one- and two - neutron emission cross sections is not as good . at the same time the total neutron @xmath113 emission cross section agrees with the experimental value . due to the statistical nature of our model one can expect that it is not so accurate for the particle emission from collective states like gdr , but works better for the multiple emission from the compound nucleus .",
    "this tendency is clearly seen in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the higher is the energy of colliding ions the greater is the number of emitted particles .",
    "therefore , the quality of description of the low energy data  @xcite may be considered as a low limit for the accuracy of the model which is expected to work better with increasing energy .",
    "it should be noticed that a simple poisson distributions for multiple excitations was adopted in our calculations . and even within this assumption the agreement with data  @xcite is acceptable , in contrast with observations of refs .",
    "this discrepancy is due to slightly different values of the partial photonuclear cross sections ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) used in our calculations as compared with the papers  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the double - photon absorption mechanism is illustrated in tab .",
    "[ t1 ] too .",
    "although the total cross section of double - photon absorption , @xmath114 mb , is small compared to the single photon one , @xmath115 mb , this contribution is very significant for the rare channels like @xmath69 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and , especially , for @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 channels .",
    "these listed channels are extremely sensitive to the presence of the double photon absorption mechanism .",
    "let us consider now the model predictions for the electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic pb and au nuclei on fixed targets at sps and in colliding beams at rhic and lhc .",
    "the total ed cross section , @xmath121 , is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) by taking @xmath122 and @xmath123 the @xmath11 values for most interesting reactions are presented in tab .",
    "[ t2 ] .    the inclusive ( multiplicity weighted ) cross sections for emission of nucleons , nuclear fragments and pions in the electromagnetic dissociation of _ one _ of the colliding @xmath124 nuclei",

    "in addition to fig .",
    "[ cs ] , where the calculations are presented only for @xmath125 reaction , in tab .",
    "[ t3 ] the inclusive cross sections are given for the three reactions listed in tab .  [ t2 ] .",
    "one can see that the partial cross sections for neutron emission are especially large .",
    "this is due to the high average neutron multiplicities , 4.1 , 7.2 and 8.8 , at sps , rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "the relative contributions to the inclusive cross sections from the double photon absorption , @xmath126 , are listed for the same reactions in tab .",
    "[ t4 ] . by inspecting tab .",
    "[ t4 ] one can conclude that about 10% , 5% and 2% of particles , on average , are produced in the second order processes at sps , rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "these values should be compared with the corresponding contributions to the total ed cross sections ( tab .",
    "[ t2 ] ) , @xmath127 , which are , 3.5% , 2.3% and 1.4% , respectively .",
    "thus , the naive expectation , that in the double photon absorption the multiplicities of particles should be exactly twice as large as in the single photon absorption , is not valid .",
    "indeed , according to this expectation the partial fractions should be twice as large as the fractions of @xmath128 in the total cross section , i.e. 7% , 4.6% and 2.8% .",
    "this rule is violated for the intermediate mass and fission fragments .",
    "nevertheless the general tendency is obvious : high order corrections become less and less important with increasing energy .",
    "this is true not only for the total ed cross section , as it was recently noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also for the partial cross sections for nucleon and fragment emission and pion production .",
    "as stressed above , neutrons are the most abundant particles produced in the ed process .",
    "in addition , there are many mechanisms of neutron emission that makes the calculation of their characteristics especially difficult . during the fast stage of the photonuclear reaction some intranuclear nucleons may escape from the nucleus via a direct knock - out either by the incoming photon or by a secondary particle in the course of the intranuclear cascade .",
    "in addition , as it was mentioned before , many neutrons may be evaporated from an excited residual nucleus .",
    "the neutron multiplicity distributions predicted by the reldis code are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmult ] for the three reactions discussed above .",
    "one can see that these distributions have a non - trivial structure .",
    "they are strongly peaked at the @xmath129 emission channel associated with the gr decay . on the other hand",
    ", there is a long tail of multiple neutron emission associated with the knock - out and evaporation processes .",
    "one can see , for example , that the probability to emit more than 20 neutrons is quite noticeable ( @xmath130 at rhic ) .",
    "the mean neutron multiplicities for the three reactions considered are 4.2 , 7.2 and 8.8 at sps , rhic and lhc energies , respectively",
    ". these results might be important for designing zero - degree calorimeters at rhic and lhc .",
    "now let us discuss the differential distributions in rapidity @xmath131 and transverse momentum @xmath132 for nucleons , nuclear fragments and pions .",
    "the lorentz - invariant inclusive differential cross sections , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , for neutrons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neut ] . obviously , the dominant part of neutrons is concentrated near the beam rapidity ( see upper panel ) . however , the cross section of neutron emission is quite large ( @xmath135 b ) even 2 - 3 units away from the beam rapidity . in our model",
    "these neutrons are produced due to reactions @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) initiated by a high - energy virtual photon .",
    "the recoil neutron in these reactions has a chance to keep a great part of the photon energy .",
    "the neutron @xmath132 distributions ( lower panel ) reveal clearly the presence of two components associated with fast and slow stages of the reaction .",
    "the evaporation neutrons are concentrated mainly at @xmath138 mev , while the high momentum tail of the @xmath132-distribution is formed by early emitted knock - out neutrons .",
    "[ fig : prot ] shows the invariant differential cross sections , @xmath133 and @xmath134 for protons .",
    "although the proton rapidity distributions are similar to those for neutrons , their transverse momentum spectra reveal a difference .",
    "namely , the evaporation component in the proton spectra is suppressed by the coulomb barrier . instead of two components ,",
    "a broad peak is seen at @xmath139 mev / c .",
    "its origin can be understood as follows .",
    "a virtual photon from the region of quasideuteron absorption , @xmath140 mev , produces a pair of nucleons with approximately equal momenta of 200 - 300 mev / c .",
    "they are emitted predominantly at angles @xmath141 with respect to the collision axis in the nuclear rest frame and therefore the corresponding @xmath132 is approximately @xmath142 mev / c .",
    "this prediction can be checked by measuring the @xmath132 distributions of protons produced in the ed reactions . up to now mainly the collective excitations of nuclei in the gr region were studied in these reactions through the neutron emission  @xcite or fission  @xcite channels .",
    "there were no special attempts to see how virtual photons interact directly with individual nucleons .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions of intermediate - mass ( @xmath143 ) and fission ( @xmath144 ) fragments are shown in fig .",

    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , shell structure effects do not play a role at these high excitation energies and , therefore , fission fragments have a symmetric charge distribution .",
    "the distribution of intermediate - mass fragments is close to a power law .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate that pions produced in the @xmath3 process may cause problems in studying @xmath0 fusion reactions .",
    "the predicted distributions of positive and negative pions from @xmath3 processes are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : pip ] and [ fig : pim ] , respectively .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath16 have very wide rapidity distributions which extend toward mid - rapidity up to @xmath145 for lhc and up to @xmath146 for rhic .",
    "one can also notice that some pions have rapidities which exceed the beam rapidity ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the multiple pion photoproduction at high energies when a large phase space is available for pions .",
    "some pions are emitted backward with respect to the virtual photon momentum .",
    "the pions produced in @xmath3 interactions close to the mid - rapidity region may create complications for the detection of particles produced from @xmath0-fusion process  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from a simple estimate . as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section to produce a @xmath149 meson at lhc is 0.144 mb and @xmath133 is peaked at @xmath150 so that almost all these mesons will have rapidities within the interval @xmath145 .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath149 decays into @xmath151 , @xmath152 or @xmath153 channels are expected at the level of @xmath154 ,  @xcite .",
    "then the cross section to produce a @xmath15 from the @xmath149 decay turns out to be below 0.007 mb . on the other hand , for @xmath15 from the @xmath3 process",
    "we predict @xmath155 mb at @xmath156 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pip ] ) .",
    "these estimations show that it will be very difficult to separate the products of the @xmath149 decay from the background of the @xmath3 process .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the detection of @xmath149 is impossible since different kinematical cuts may be applied to suppress the @xmath3 background , as well as other decay modes may be used for the @xmath149 detection .",
    "the considered example rather demonstrates the importance of the proper evaluation of the @xmath3 background in planning experiments on @xmath0 fusion at future colliders .",
    "in this paper we have further developed the model of electromagnetic dissociation of nuclei first introduced in ref .",
    "the computer code reldis is developed to calculate a wide range of observable characteristics associated with the ed reactions .",
    "this code includes the dissociation channels with nucleons , pions , fission fragments and intermediate mass fragments from nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "the model calculations are in a good agreement with experimental data obtained for the dissociation of 1 gev / nucleon @xmath110 ions .",
    "this gives us the basis to put forward predictions for the electromagnetic dissociation of ultrarelativistic heavy ions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "one should bear in mind that the multiplicities of particle produced by high - energy virtual photons are rather small as compared with those in central nuclear collisions .",
    "but the reaction rates are large . besides the fundamental interest",
    ", the ed process may have interesting applications .",
    "as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutron emission in the ed process may be used for luminosity monitoring via zero degree calorimeters .",
    "detailed calculations presented in this paper make it possible to eliminate some unnecessary simplifications in evaluating the neutron transverse momentum distributions which were adopted in ref .",
    "although the advantages of detecting mutual one - neutron dissociation events are prominent  @xcite , one should carefully estimate the contribution of more deep dissociation processes , as it has been made in the present paper .",
    "the electromagnetic fission of @xmath64 and @xmath65 nuclei will be also noticeable at rhic and lhc .",
    "an alternative approach to luminosity monitoring would be to measure the yields of fission fragments or protons , which can be easily separated from the beam nuclei by their different z / a - ratio .",
    "using presented above @xmath132 distributions of fission and intermediate mass fragments one can estimate the response of forward detectors to such fragments .",
    "the calculated differential distributions of pions should be taken into consideration in planning experiments on @xmath0 fusion at cern  @xcite .",
    "one can use the predictions of the present model in order to disentangle different mechanisms of the heavy - ion dissociation , not only though the measurement of the z - dependence of the total cross section , as it was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also through the registration of some specific exclusive channels ( multiple neutron emission , for example ) .",
    "such measurements are needed , in particular , for understanding the origin of the correction term in the dissociation cross section found in ref .",
