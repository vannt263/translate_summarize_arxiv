    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are qualitative changes occuring in the properties of the ground state of a many - body system due to modifications either in the interactions among its constituents or in their interactions with an external probe @xcite , while the system remains at zero temperature .",
    "typically , such changes are induced as a parameter @xmath0 in the system hamiltonian @xmath1 is varied across a point at which the transition is made from one quantum phase to a different one",
    ". often some correlation length diverges at this point , in which case the latter is called a _ quantum critical point_. because thermal fluctuations are inhibited , qpts are purely driven by quantum fluctuations : fluctuations or correlations in the value of some observable or observables that occur in a pure state . thus , these are purely quantum phenomena : a classical system in a pure state can not exhibit correlations .",
    "prominent examples of qpts are the quantum paramagnet to ferromagnet transition occurring in ising spin systems under an external transverse magnetic field @xcite , the superconductor to insulator transition in high-@xmath2 superconducting systems , and the superfluid to mott insulator transition originally predicted for liquid helium and recently observed in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .    since entanglement is a property inherent to quantum states and intimately related to quantum correlations @xcite , one would expect that , in some appropriately defined sense , the entanglement present in the ground state undergoes a substantial change across a point where a qpt occurs .",
    "recently , several authors attempted to better understand qpts by studying the behavior of different measures of entanglement in the ground state of exactly solvable models ( see @xcite for representative contributions ) .",
    "such investigations primarily focused on characterizing entanglement using information - theoretic concepts , such as the entropy of entanglement @xcite or the concurrence @xcite , developed for _ bipartite _ systems . in particular , a detailed analysis of the two - spin concurrence has been carried out for the xy model in a transverse magnetic field @xcite , whereas the entanglement between a block of nearby spins and the rest of the chain has been considered in @xcite . while a variety of suggestive results emerge from such studies , in general a full characterization of the quantum correlations near and at a quantum critical point will not be possible solely in terms of bipartite entanglement . identifying the entanglement measure or measures that best capture the relevant properties close to criticality , including the critical exponents and universality class of the transition , remains open problems in quantum information and condensed matter theory .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we introduced _ generalized entanglement _ ( ge ) as a notion extending the essential properties of entanglement beyond the conventional subsystem - based framework .",
    "this notion is general in the sense that it is definable relative to _ any distinguished subset of observables _ , without explicit reference to subsystems , which makes it directly applicable to any algebraic language used to describe the system ( fermions , bosons , spins , etc . )",
    "@xcite . founding the notion on a distinguished set of observables",
    "makes it especially well suited to studying qpts , as our definition makes the existence of ge equivalent to the existence of nonzero correlations or fluctuations in those observables .",
    "the basic idea is that any quantum state gives rise to a reduced state on the distinguished subset of observables @xcite .",
    "these reduced states form a convex set ; as with standard quantum states , there are pure ( extremal ) and mixed ( non - extremal ) ones  @xcite .",
    "we define a _ generalized entangled _",
    "pure state , relative to a subspace of observables , to be one whose reduced state on that subspace is _",
    "although we will have little occasion in the present context to apply it to states that are mixed relative to the full set of observables , we extend this notion to include mixed states by defining a generalized entangled mixed state to be one that can not be written as a convex combination of generalized - unentangled pure states .    the special case in which the observable set is a lie algebra is often important in physics . in a broad class of such algebras described below , the algebra is not only a subspace of operators , but is such that we can define a natural hermitian projection onto that subspace",
    ". then a simple ( global ) measure of ge for quantum states is provided by what we call the _ purity relative to the algebra_. this is defined as the squared length of the projection of the hermitian operator ( density matrix ) representing the state onto the algebra . as argued in @xcite , if the correct algebra is chosen , the purity contains information about the relevant quantum correlations that uniquely identify and characterize qpts of the system .    in this paper , we deepen and expand the analysis initiated in @xcite , by focusing on the detection of qpts due to a broken symmetry as revealed by the behavior of an appropriate relative purity of the ground state . in section [ sectionpurity ]",
    ", we recall the relevant mathematical setting and the definition of the relative purity as a function of the expectation values of the distinguished observables . in section",
    "[ examples ] , we discuss several examples where the relative purity is seen to provide a natural measure of entanglement . in section [ purity - qpt ] , we illustrate some physical criteria that are relevant in choosing the appropriate observable subalgebra and using ge as an indicator of qpts . in sections [ lmg ] and [ xymodel ] we explicitly characterize the qpts present in the so - called lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite and in the one - dimensional spin-1/2 anisotropic xy model in a transverse magnetic field , respectively .",
    "this is done by studying the properties of the purity relative to different algebras of observables in the ground state of both models .",
    "we find the relevant critical exponents for these models , and in the case of the anisotropic xy model in a transverse magnetic field , obtain a new `` global '' disorder parameter , the variance of the number of spinless fermionic excitations in a jordan - wigner - transformed representation of the system .",
    "finally , we provide in separate appendices the details underlying various statements made in the main body of the paper .",
    "these include the relationship between standard separability and ge ( appendix a ) , the ge properties of two special classes of spin states , the cluster and valence bond solid states ( appendix b ) , the proof of the relationship between the local purity and the meyer - wallach entanglement measure ( appendix c ) , and the semiclassical properties of the lmg model in the thermodynamic limit ( appendix d ) .",
    "in the ge approach , entanglement is considered as an _ observer - dependent _ property of a quantum state , which is determined by the physically relevant point of view through the expectation values of a distinguished subset of observables . whenever a preferred decomposition into subsystems is specified in terms of an appropriate ( physical or encoded @xcite ) tensor product structure",
    ", ge becomes identical to standard entanglement provided that distinguished observables corresponding to all _ local _ actions on the individual subsystems are chosen : in particular , for @xmath3 with dim(@xmath4 , standard entanglement of states in @xmath5 is recovered as ge relative to @xmath6 @xcite ( see also appendix [ app1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the subsystems relative to which standard entanglement is defined ( whether directly identifiable with physical degrees of freedom or related to `` encoded '' or `` virtual '' ones ) are always understandable in terms of appropriate ( associative ) algebras of local observables .",
    "this has been observed before , e.g. in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent analysis ) .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the ge notion genuinely extends the standard entanglement definition , and does not coincide with or reduce to it in general . on one hand , this may be appreciated by noticing that even for situations where a subsystem partition is naturally present , states which are manifestly _ separable _ relative to such a partition may possess ge relative to an algebra different from @xmath7 ( see the two spin-1 example of section [ examples ] ) . on the other hand , as also emphasized in @xcite , ge is operationally meaningful in situations where _ no _ physically accessible decomposition into subsystems exists , thus making conventional entanglement not directly definable .      as mentioned in the introduction , we will focus on the case where the distinguished observables form a lie algebra @xmath8 of linear operators , acting on a finite - dimensional state space @xmath5 for the system of interest , @xmath9 .",
    "( note that we will not usually distinguish between the abstract lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath8 , and the concrete lie algebra @xmath8 of operators that faithfully represents it on @xmath5 . )",
    "we will assume @xmath8 to be a real lie algebra consisting of hermitian operators , with the bracket of two linear operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 being given by = i ( xy - yx ) .",
    "in this way , operators in @xmath8 can be directly associated with physical observables . for the same reason",
    ", we will also use a slightly nonstandard ( but familiar to physicists ) notion of the lie group generated by @xmath8 , involving the map @xmath12 instead of the mathematicians @xmath13 , for @xmath14 .",
    "no assumption that the lie algebra acts irreducibly on @xmath5 ( i.e. , that it admits no nontrivial invariant subspaces ) will be made , but important consequences of making such an assumption will be discussed",
    ". we will also assume the lie algebra to be closed under hermitian conjugation .",
    "this implies that it is a _ reductive _ algebra ( not to be confused with reducibility of the representation ) . in our context",
    ", a reductive lie algebra is best thought of as the product ( direct sum , as a vector space ) of a finite number of _ simple _ lie algebras , and a finite number of copies of a one - dimensional abelian lie algebra .",
    "simple _ lie algebra is a non - abelian one possessing no nontrivial ideals , where an ideal is a subalgebra invariant under commutation with anything in the algebra ; the relevant property of ideals here is that they can be quotiented out of the algebra , allowing it to be written as a nontrivial product of ideal and quotient ; thus simple lie algebras are non - abelian ones that can not be decomposed into factors , so the factorization used in defining reductive lie algebras above is maximal",
    ". the product ( direct vector - space sum ) of a finite number of simple lie algebras is called _ semisimple _ , and thus a reductive algebra is the product of a semisimple and an abelian part .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for relevant background on lie algebras and their representation theory .",
    "as this subsection unfolds , we will summarize much of this representation theory in a way suited to our needs , and the reader should concentrate on understanding the content of the statements , and not vex him or herself unduly about understanding why they are true",
    ".    we will consider pure quantum states of @xmath9 , @xmath15 , as well as mixed quantum states of @xmath9 , described by density matrices @xmath16 acting on @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath8 was assumed closed under hermitian conjugation , the projection of a quantum state @xmath16 onto @xmath8 with respect to the trace inner product is uniquely defined .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the projection map , @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath16 is a pure state , @xmath19 , the _ purity of @xmath20 relative to @xmath8 _ ( or @xmath8-purity ) is defined as the squared length of the projection according to the trace inner product norm @xcite ; that is p _ ( | ) = tr[(p_(|| ) ) ^2 ] .",
    "[ p0 ] the @xmath8-purity may be explicitly evaluated upon selecting an operator basis @xmath21 for @xmath8 . by assuming the @xmath22 to be hermitian , @xmath23 and orthogonal , @xmath24 eq .",

    "an important property following is that the @xmath8-purity is _ invariant _ under group transformations : if a new basis for @xmath8 is introduced by letting @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 real numbers , then one finds @xmath31 sometimes it is useful to introduce a common normalization factor @xmath32 in order to set the maximum value of the purity to 1 , in which case eq .",
    "( [ purity0 ] ) becomes @xmath33    as mentioned earlier , a pure quantum state @xmath20 is defined to be _",
    "generalized entangled _ ( _ generalized unentangled _ ) relative to @xmath8 if it induces a mixed ( pure ) state on that set of observables .",
    "when @xmath8 is a complex semisimple lie algebra acting _ irreducibly _ on @xmath5 , it was shown in @xcite ( theorem 14 , part ( 4 ) ) that @xmath20 is generalized unentangled with respect to @xmath8 _ if and only _ if it has maximum @xmath8-purity , and generalized entangled otherwise . under the same assumptions , the abovementioned theorem ( part ( 3 ) )",
    "also leads to the identification of the generalized unentangled pure states as the _ generalized coherent states _ ( gcss ) associated with @xmath8 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "all generalized unentangled states are in the ( unique ) orbit of a minimum weight state of @xmath8 ( taken as a reference state ) under the action of the lie group .",
    "remarkably , gcss are known to possess _ minimum invariant uncertainty _ , @xmath34 $ ] @xcite , so that , similar to the familiar harmonic - oscillator ones , they may be regarded in some sense as closest to  classical \" states .    our characterization theorem for generalized unentangled states on irreducible representations used some standard facts from the theory of semisimple lie algebras and their representations that will also be useful in the discussion of reducible representations in the next subsection .",
    "these are the existence of cartan ( in the semisimple context , maximal abelian ) subalgebras , their conjugacy under the action of the lie group associated with the algebra , and the fact that any finite - dimensional representation , given a choice of cartan subalgebra ( csa ) , decomposes into mutually orthogonal `` weight spaces , '' which are simultaneously eigenspaces of all csa elements .",
    "the map from csa elements to their eigenvalues on a given weight space is a linear functional on the csa called the `` weight '' of that weight space .",
    "the theorem also uses the observation that the projection of the state into the lie algebra is necessarily a hermitian element of that algebra , hence semisimple ( diagonalizable ) , hence belonging to some csa , which we call its _ supporting csa_. frequently , semisimple lie algebras are presented by giving a _ cartan - weyl _ basis , consisting of a set of commuting , jointly diagonalizable operators that generate a csa of the algbera , and a set of so - called `` weyl operators '' that are non - diagonalizable , and act to take a state in one weight space to a state in another ( or else annihilate it ) : in physical examples these are often called `` raising and lowering operators . ''",
    "normalized states correspond to normalized linear functionals on the lie algebra ; when a cartan - weyl basis for the algebra is chosen such that the csa distinguished by the basis is the supporting csa for a given state , the state is zero except on the csa part of the basis . on the csa ,",
    "the state is some convex combination of the weights , that is an element of the _ weight polytope _ ( which is defined as the convex hull of the weights ) .",
    "so it turns out that extremal states on the lie algebra correspond to extremal points of the weight polytope .",
    "this applies regardless of whether the representation is irreducible or not . for irreducible representations ( irreps ) ,",
    "the extremal points of the weight polytope are also highest - weight states of the irrep .",
    "reducible representations are discussed in the next subsection ( along with some comments on reductive algebras ) .    in preparation for that",
    ", we introduce another aspect of standard lie theory : the weyl group . besides being able to take any csa to any other csa ,",
    "the lie group also acts on the weight polytope for a given csa , by reflections in a set of hyperplanes through the origin .",
    "the group these generate is called the weyl group .",
    "considered together , the hyperplanes divide the weight space into a set of convex cones , sometimes called _ weyl chambers _ , whose points are at the origin , and whose union with the hyperplanes is the entire space . any such cone can be mapped to any other via the weyl group action , and the weight polytope of the representation is the convex hull of the weyl group orbits of the weights in the closure of any single weyl chamber .",
    "it is important to realize that the relationships just mentioned between maximal purity , generalized coherence , and generalized unentanglement established for a pure state relative to an irreducibly represented algebra @xmath8 do _ not _ automatically extend to the case where @xmath8 acts reducibly on @xmath5 .",
    "we will discuss semisimple algebras first and then , because the algebra we use to analyze the lmg model is abelian , the case of reductive algebras .",
    "if @xmath8 is semisimple , a generic finite - dimensional representation of @xmath8 may be decomposed as a direct sum of irreducible invariant subspaces , @xmath35 , with each of the @xmath36 being in turn the direct sum of its weight spaces .",
    "every irrep appearing in the decomposition has a highest ( or lowest ) weight , and for each of these irreps , there is a manifold of gcss for the irrep constructed as the orbit of a highest weight state for that irrep .",
    "the weight polytope for the _ reducible _ representation will be the convex hull of those for all the irreps contained in it .",
    "because of this , the gcss for these irreps will _ not _ , in general , all satisfy the extremality property that defines generalized unentangled states .",
    "this reflects the fact that even for a state belonging to a specific @xmath8-irrep , ge is a property which depends in general on how the state relates to the whole representation , not solely the irrep . nor is there necessarily a single weight , for one of the constituent irreps , that generates ( as the convex hull of the weyl group orbit ) the weight polytope of the reducible representation .",
    "indeed , the extremal weights in the weight polytope , which correspond to generalized unentangled states , need not all have the same length .",
    "since this squared length is the @xmath8-purity ( as defined in eq .",
    "( [ purity0 ] ) ) of the corresponding state , it is thus no longer the case that all generalized unentangled states have maximal lie - algebraic purity .",
    "however , maximal purity remains a _",
    "sufficient _ , though no longer a necessary , condition for generalized unentanglement .",
    "if the algebra is reductive , the expectations of a maximal commutative subalgebra now include ones for the abelian part of the algebra , i.e. operators that commute with the entire algebra",
    ". these must be proportional to the identity on each irrep , but may have different eigenvalues ( possibly degenerate ) on different irreps .",
    "states on this algebra then involve not just weights for the semisimple part of the algebra , but expectation values for the abelian part of the algebra as well .",
    "these can distinguish different subsets of the irreps , and so irreps whose highest weight for the semisimple part is not extremal for the semisimple part , may become extremal ( generalized unentangled ) in the full reductive algebra .",
    "however , maximal quadratic purity will remain a sufficient , though in general still not necessary , condition for a state being generalized unentangled .",
    "more intuition about ge , purity , and gcss may be gained from simple examples .",
    "consider a physical system which is composed of two spin-@xmath37 ( namely , two qubits ) , and let them be labeled by @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , and corresponding @xmath40 generators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "consider ge relative to a _ global _ representation of @xmath40 , whose total - spin generators are @xmath44 .",
    "this representation splits into two irreps , the one - dimensional singlet representation with @xmath45 and the three - dimensional triplet representation with @xmath46 .",
    "the generalized unentangled states relative to this representation of @xmath40 are those for which there exists an @xmath47 such that the state is a @xmath48 eigenstate of @xmath49 . with respect to the csa @xmath50 , those are the states @xmath51 , which are also gcss ( with purity equal to 1 ) . no generalized unentangled state",
    "is contained in the singlet irrep . in particular ,",
    "neither the spin - zero state in the triplet , nor that which spans the singlet , are generalized unentangled ( they both have purity equal to 0 ) , nor are they on highest - weight orbits ( thus gcss ) .    as another example consider a single spin-1 system , whose state space @xmath52 carries an irrep of @xmath40 @xcite . in this case , for any choice of spin direction ( say @xmath53 ) only the @xmath54 eigenstates are generalized coherent .",
    "there is also a one - dimensional @xmath55 eigenspace .",
    "the maximal - purity states are also the highest - weight states ; however , the pure @xmath56 eigenstate is not a gcs , has zero purity , and is generalized entangled .",
    "if , for the same system , a distinguished algebra @xmath57 generated by @xmath58 alone is chosen , then the representation reduces as the direct sum of the three invariant one - dimensional subspaces corresponding to @xmath59 . in this case , three different orbits exist in the representation , each of them consisting of only one state up to phases .",
    "however , only the states with @xmath60 are extremal , whereas the state with @xmath56 is not : as one can easily verify from the fact that the reduced state is now just the expectation value of @xmath58 , an equal mixture of a @xmath61 and a @xmath62 state has the same reduced state as a @xmath56 state , so the latter remains , as in the irreducible case , generalized entangled .",
    "a generalization of the latter example , which is relevant to the lmg model we will study in section [ lmg ] , is the case of a spin-@xmath63 system with a distinguished abelian subalgebra generated by @xmath58 .",
    "again , one can see that only the states with maximal magnitude of @xmath58 are generalized unentangled , and only they have maximal purity .    by definition ,",
    "note that the relative purity and the invariant uncertainty functionals as defined in the previous section relate to each other via @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the quadratic casimir invariant of the lie algebra and @xmath66 is given by eq .",
    "( [ purity0 ] ) ( prior to rescaling ) .",
    "because , by standard representation theory , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 within each irrep , relative purity and invariant uncertainty essentially provide the same information if @xmath8 acts irreducibly .",
    "this , however , is no longer true in general in the reducible case . in the above two - spin-1/2 example , for instance , the two measures agree on the singlet sector ; for triplet states , @xmath69 , thus the invariant uncertainty value is 1 ( same as @xmath66 ) for @xmath60 ( generalized unentangled ) states , whereas it yields 2 for the ( zero - purity ) state with @xmath56 in the triplet sector .      for mixed states on @xmath5 , the direct generalization of the squared length of the projection onto @xmath8 as in eq .",
    "( [ p0 ] ) does _ not _ give a ge measure with well - defined monotonicity properties under appropriate generalizations of the locc semigroup of transformations @xcite . a proper extension of the quadratic purity measure defined in the previous section for pure states to mixed states",
    "may be naturally obtained via a standard convex roof construction . if @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the latter is obtained by calculating the maximum @xmath8-purity ( minimum entanglement ) over all possible convex decompositions @xmath73 of the density operator @xmath16 as a pure - state ensemble . in general , similarly to what happens for most mixed - state entanglement measures , the required extremization makes the resulting quantity very hard to compute .",
    "while a more expanded discussion of mixed - state ge measures is given in @xcite , we focus here on applying the notion of ge to characterize qpts in different lattice systems .",
    "because the latter take place in the limit of zero temperature , the ground state of the system may be assumed to be pure under ideal conditions .",
    "accordingly , eq . ( [ purity1 ] ) will suffice for our current purposes .",
    "we now apply the concept of relative purity to different physical systems in order to understand its meaning as a measure of entanglement for pure quantum states .",
    "first , we will concentrate on spin systems , showing that for particular subsets of observables , the @xmath8-purity can be reduced to the usual notion of entanglement : the pure quantum states that can be written as a product of states of each party will be generalized unentangled .",
    "however , for other physically natural choices of observable sets , this is no longer the case .",
    "next , we study the @xmath8-purity as a measure of entanglement for fermionic systems , since this is a good starting point for the analysis of the qpt present in the anisotropic xy model in a transverse magnetic field ( section [ xymodel ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show that if a fermionic state can be represented as a single slater determinant , it is generalized unentangled relative to the lie algebra @xmath74 , which is built from bilinear products of fermionic operators .",
    "these examples illustrate how the concept and measure of ge is applicable to systems described by different operator languages , in preparation for the study of qpts .",
    "let us introduce the following representative quantum states for @xmath75 spins of magnitude @xmath76 : @xmath77 where the product state @xmath78 , and @xmath79 denotes the state of the @xmath80th party with @xmath53-component of the spin equal to @xmath81 ( defining the relevant computational basis for the @xmath80th subsystem ) .      for simplicity , we begin by studying the ge of a two - qubit system ( two spin-1/2s ) , where the most general pure quantum state can be written as @xmath82 , with the complex numbers @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 satisfying @xmath87 .",

    "therefore , the normalization factor @xmath99 may be obtained by setting @xmath100 in such a product state . as explained in section [ sectionpurity ] , @xmath101 is invariant under group operations , i.e. , in this case , local rotations .",
    "since all gcss of @xmath8 belong to the same orbit generated by the application of group operations to a particular product state ( a reference state like @xmath102 ) , they all consistently have maximum @xmath8-purity ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "another important insight may be gained by calculating the purity relative to the algebra of _ all _ observables for the system , @xmath103 in this case .",
    "one finds that _ any _ two spin-1/2 pure state @xmath20 ( including bell s states ) is then generalized _ un_entangled ( @xmath100 , see also fig .",
    "[ twoparties ] ) .",
    "this property is a manifestation of the relative nature of ge , as considering the set of all observables as being physically accessible is equivalent to not making any preferred subsystem decomposition .",

    "we observe that the purity reduces again to the traditional concept of entanglement for higher spin if it is calculated relative to the ( irreducible ) lie algebra of _ all _ local observables @xmath107 .",
    "for example , if we are interested in distinguishing product states from entangled states in a two - spin-1s system , we need to calculate the purity relative to the ( irreducible ) algebra @xmath108 , where the @xmath109 hermitian and traceless matrices @xmath110 are the well known gell - mann matrices @xcite : @xmath111 which satisfy @xmath112 = \\delta_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ ] . in this basis , the computational spin-1 states are represented by the 3-dimensional vectors @xmath113 then , the relative purity for a generic pure state @xmath20 becomes @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the expectation value of @xmath116 in the state @xmath20 .",
    "in this way , product states like @xmath98 are generalized unentangled ( @xmath100 ) and states like @xmath117 ( and states connected through local spin unitary operations ) , are maximally entangled in this algebra ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "different results are obtained if the purity is calculated relative to a _ subalgebra of local observables_. for example , the two - spin-1 product state @xmath118 where both spins have zero projection along @xmath53 becomes generalized entangled relative to the ( irreducible ) algebra @xmath119 of local spin rotations , which is generated by @xmath120 , the spin-1 angular momentum operators @xmath121 for each spin being given by @xmath122 notice that access to local angular momentum observables suffices to operationally characterize the system as describable in terms of two spin-1 particles ( by imagining , for instance , performing a stern - gerlach - type of experiment on each particle ) .",
    "thus , even when a subsystem decomposition can be naturally identified from the beginning in this case , states which are manifestly separable ( unentangled ) in the standard sense may exhibit ge ( see also appendix [ app1 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", this is physically quite natural in the example , since there are no su(2 ) @xmath123 su(2 ) group operations ( local rotations ) that are able to transform the state @xmath124 into the unentangled product state @xmath125 .",

    "a second , closely related observation is that the purity must contain information about quantum correlations which undergo a qualitative change as the transition point is crossed : thus , the corresponding degree of entanglement , as measured by the purity , must depend on the interaction strengths governing the phase transition .",
    "finally , whenever a degeneracy of the ground state exists or emerges in the thermodynamic limit , a physical requirement is that the purity be the same for all ground states .",
