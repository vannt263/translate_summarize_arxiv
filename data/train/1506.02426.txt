    "the orion - eridanus superbubble is a nearby ( @xmath1400 pc ) expanding structure that is thought to span 20@xmath2 @xmath3 45@xmath2 on the sky @xcite . because of its proximity and evolutionary stage ,",
    "it is traced at a multitude of wavelengths @xcite , serving as a benchmark to the study of superbubbles .",
    "the expansion of the bubble is most likely connected to the combined effects of ionizing uv radiation , stellar winds , and a sequence of supernova explosions from the orion ob association , orion ob1 @xcite .",
    "the line of sight expansion of the orion - eridanus superbubble is previously estimated at @xmath1 15 km s@xmath4 through line - splitting of h@xmath5 , which also revealed a total ionized gas mass of 8 @xmath3 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 and a kinetic energy of @xmath8 >  1.9 @xmath3 10@xmath9 erg @xcite .",

    "it is argued that the orion - eridanus superbubble is larger and more complex than previously thought , and that the entire morphological appearance of the superbubble can be viewed as a series of nested shells , superimposed along the line of sight .",
    "the shells originate from explosive feedback from orion ob1 that accelerate , sweep - up , and compress the superbubble interior plasmas in an episodic fashion to form nested shells within the orion - eridanus superbubble .",

    "the absence of an hi shell associated with barnard s loop is surprising , and encouraged us to investigate the gas- and dust content of barnard s loop and the orion - eridanus superbubble in more detail ; our findings are presented in the next subsections .",
    "@xcite defined two small regions of barnard s loop which are clear of any dense molecular clouds along the line of sight ; we use the same apertures in the following analysis ( bl@xmath14 and bl@xmath15 ; fig .",

    "we can compare this to the _ expected _ optical depth , @xmath27 , from the density ( 3.4 @xmath17 ) , estimated line of sight depth ( 45 pc for a 1@xmath2 thickness ) and the opacity at 353 ghz ( @xmath28 = 7.9 @xmath3 10@xmath29 @xmath30 h@xmath4 ) appropriate for the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath27 = 4.0 @xmath3 10@xmath26 , in close agreement with @xmath25 , which implies that dust mixed with the ionized shell of barnard s loop is alike to dust seen in the diffuse ism .",
    "@xcite concluded that grain temperatures in barnard s loop are higher than in hi regions , and proposed that ly@xmath5 photons might contribute to the heating of the dust .",

    "we derive an intensity of @xmath31 = 14 reaching barnard s loop in units of the habing field @xcite , taking into account the radiation from the 7 most massive stars in orion ob ( @xmath32 ori c , @xmath33 ori , @xmath34 ori , @xmath32 ori a , @xmath35 ori , @xmath36 ori , @xmath37 ori ) , using stellar parameters from @xcite .",

    "these apertures coincide with the outlines depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : superbubble]d . while the full extent of the orion - eridanus superbubble will be thoroughly discussed in the remainder of this paper",

    "the encompassed ir emission will therefore be contaminated by emission along the line of sight not related to the superbubble . while disentangling the separate contributions to the ir",

    "subsequently , we define emission from regions that are much brighter than observed in the limb - brightened filaments , i.e. , @xmath43 @xmath44 3@xmath42 , as _ not _ being part of the superbubble . this procedure provides a mask tracing the regions of high ir brightness towards the galactic plane , and high - latitude fore- and background clouds well .",
    "note that this procedure filters out the emission from , e.g. , the omcs as well ; we ultimately add the contributions of the omc and barnard s loop apertures to get the full ir intensity of the superbubble and the relative contributions of the components ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : obschar ] ) . for the h@xmath5 map ,",
    "the background contamination is much less severe and a masking procedure is not necessary . in this respect",
    ", we will argue below that all of the observed h@xmath5 in fig . [",
    "fig : superbubble]b is caused by photo - ionization from orion ob1 .    while the masking procedure accounts for the high - ir intensities of contaminating clouds towards the galactic plane , it does not correct for the diffuse low - level background observed over the entire images . therefore , we apply a _ global _ background subtraction to both the far - ir and h@xmath5 maps by measuring the background level within a circular region of 0.4 degree radius at ( @xmath45,@xmath46 ) = ( 229.6 , -33.7 ) _ outside _ of the superbubble aperture that appears to be free of obvious emission features and provides a proper representation of the diffuse background emission averaged over latitude . for both maps , we do not include the @xmath0 ori region in our analysis as it appears to be encircled by an ionization - bounded hii  region @xcite , and can be regarded as being separated from orion ob1 .",
    "table [ tab : obschar ] lists two different values of @xmath47 .",
    "the first value is obtained by filling the masked region with the average ir brightness from the unmasked part of the superbubble aperture . in this way",
    ", we get an estimate of the full ir intensity of the entire superbubble if it were unaffected by fore- or background emission along the line of sight .",
    "the second value is obtained by setting the masked part to zero , and therefore neglects the masked part of the superbubble .",
    "the choice of including or excluding the masked part of the superbubble affects the inferred luminosities from the omc and barnard s loop as well , as these apertures are completely immersed in the masked region of the image , and the chosen intensity of the masked region thus effectively acts as a ` global ' background for both regions .",
    "below , we will include the masked region in our interpretations , as we believe that the inclusion of this part of the superbubble is essential to the analysis of the total energetics of the region . however , we refer the reader to table [ tab : obschar ] for the implications of this choice and its impact on the derived parameters .",
    "the total far - ir luminosity is @xmath47 = 4@xmath48@xmath49@xmath50 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the total integrated intensity and projected surface area of the emitting region . for simplicity , we assume that the entire bubble is located at 400 pc . the measured ir luminosity is compared with stellar parameters of orion ob1 through @xmath51 = @xmath47/@xmath52 , where @xmath52 is the total luminosity of the orion ob region ( 1.7 @xmath3 10@xmath53 @xmath54 , re - evaluated at @xmath55 = 400 pc , and excluding @xmath0 ori ; @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 defines the fraction of stellar radiation that is captured by the dust and re - emitted in the ir averaged over all solid angles .",
    "the ly@xmath5 photon rate , @xmath56 , is calculated by converting the observed h@xmath5 photon rate to a ly@xmath5 photon rate using the ratio @xmath57/@xmath58 , where @xmath58 is the effective recombination coefficient of h@xmath5 ( 1.31 @xmath3 10@xmath59 @xmath60 s@xmath4 at @xmath61 = 6000 k , which is the electron temperature in barnard s loop and the eridanus filaments from @xcite , we use this value throughout the superbubble ) , and @xmath57 is the total recombination coefficient of hydrogen to all levels but the ground state ( 2.6 @xmath3 10@xmath59 @xmath17 s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",

    "this cycle repeats as long as there is ongoing star formation and ob stars can maintain ( the photo - ionization of ) the cleansing shells that deposit the mass towards the outer regions .",
