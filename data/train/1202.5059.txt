    "the creation of new types of crystalline or partially ordered states and the dynamics of assemblies of interacting particles have attracted much attention both in terms of the basic science of self - assembly and dynamic pattern formation as well as for applications utilizing self - assembly processes .",
    "one of the most extensively studied systems exhibiting this behavior is assemblies of colloidal particles , where the equilibrium structures can be tuned by changing the directionality of the colloid - colloid interactions @xcite . since it can be difficult to control and tune the exact form of the interaction , another approach is to use colloids with well defined interactions that are placed on some type of ordered substrate .",
    "optical trapping techniques are one of the most common methods of creating periodic substrates for colloids @xcite . studies of colloidal ordering and melting for one dimensional ( 1d ) periodic substrate arrays have revealed ordered colloidal crystalline structures as well as smectic type structures where the colloids are crystalline in one direction and liquidlike in the other @xcite .",
    "these experiments show that the substrate strength strongly influences the type of colloidal structure that forms and that as the substrate strength increases , the resulting enhancement of fluctuations can induce a transition from crystalline to smectic order @xcite .",
    "numerous different colloidal crystalline structures can also appear on 1d substrate arrays of fixed periodicity when the colloid density is varied @xcite .",
    "more recent studies addressed colloidal ordering on two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic substrates @xcite . in these systems , the filling factor @xmath0 is defined as the number of colloids per substrate minimum . for integer fillings @xmath1 , the colloids in each minimum can form an effective rigid @xmath2-mer , such as a dimer or trimer @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-mers have an orientational degree of freedom , and depending on the effective interaction between neighboring @xmath2-mers , all the @xmath2-mers may align into a ferromagnetically ordered state , sit perpendicularly to their neighbors in an antiferromagnetically ordered state , or form other orientationally ordered states . for square and triangular substrate arrays , @xmath2-mer states have been studied up to @xmath3 @xcite ; however , it is not known what structures would form at higher fillings when the simple picture of rigid @xmath2-mers no longer applies",
    ". studies of the ordering of bidisperse colloidal assemblies with two different charges on 2d periodic substrates produced novel ordered phases , while a pattern switching could be induced by application of an external field @xcite .",
    "similar pattern switching also occurs for colloids with monodisperse charges under external driving @xcite .",
    "the colloidal @xmath2-mer states have been termed `` colloidal molecular crystals , '' and for conditions under which they loose their orientational ordering , they are referred to as `` colloidal plastic crystals . ''",
    "colloidal molecular crystals appear for integer fillings @xmath1 . at fractional fillings such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ,",
    "it is possible for ordered composite states to form containing two coexisting species of @xmath2-mers ; however , for other fractional fillings , the system is frustrated and the @xmath2-mer states are disordered @xcite .",
    "other studies have shown that novel orderings appear when the 2d substrate array has quasicrystalline order @xcite .    once colloidal crystals have formed on a substrate , the driven dynamics can be explored by applying an external driving field to the sample .",
    "a variety of dynamical locking phases can occur in which the colloids preferentially flow along symmetry directions of the substrate @xcite . as the filling fraction @xmath0 is varied , a series of peaks in the critical force needed to depin the colloids occurs at integer values of @xmath0 indicating the existence of commensurability effects @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with strongly interacting colloids on two periodic arrays show that kink - type dynamics can occur near @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore higher fillings where new types of dynamics could emerge @xcite .    many of the same types of phenomena found in colloidal molecular crystals can also be realized for other systems that can be modeled as interacting particles in the presence of a 2d periodic substrate .",
    "for example , the antiferromagnetic ordering of dimer colloidal molecular crystals on a square substrate was reproduced using vortices in bose - einstein condensates confined by optical traps with two vortices per trap @xcite as well as with vortices trapped by large pinning sites in type - ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "experimental and numerical studies of molecular ordering on periodic substrates show similar orderings @xcite .",
    "other systems where similar states could be realized include classical electrons or dusty plasmas with some form of substrate as well as crystalline cold atoms on optical lattices .    to our knowledge ,",
    "previous studies of yukawa interacting colloidal molecular crystals have focused only on systems with up to four colloids per trap .",
    "for the case of three colloids per trap , only a limited number of studies have considered the dynamics , and even in this limit there are several new features that we describe for the first time in this work .",
    "we show that at high fillings , the rigid @xmath2-mer picture breaks down and new cluster and ring states form .",
    "several general features of the statics and dynamics emerge at these larger fillings which are independent of the specific filling .",
    "one of the key findings in our work is the development of orientationally ordered shell structures at higher fillings for the 2d arrays .",
    "the development of particle shell structures was studied previously for repulsive particles in isolated individual traps , in systems that include classical charges @xcite , wigner islands @xcite , dusty plasmas @xcite , colloids @xcite , charged balls in traps @xcite , and vortices in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "the shell ordering in these systems can be altered by the shape or type of trap as well as by competing attractive and repulsive interactions between the particles @xcite . in our system",
    ", the particles within each shell can exhibit an additional ordering due to interactions with particles in the neighboring traps .",
    "we show that as a function of substrate strength , a rich variety of colloidal cluster crystals can be created depending on the filling , and that certain shell structures are more stable than others .",
    "the number of particles in the shells and the number of shells depend on the substrate strength , and in certain cases the particles form ring structures instead of shells .",
    "we also find reentrant ordered phases as a function of substrate strength . for weak and strong substrates ,",
    "the system is ordered ; however , for substrates of intermediate strength , the system is generally disordered .",
    "we find that the depinning threshold can show distinct changes at the boundaries between these different phases as a function of substrate strength , and remarkably , we find that in some cases it is possible for the depinning force to decrease with increasing substrate strength .",
    "the velocity - force curves contain clear signatures of the different phases corresponding to different modes of depinning .",
    "we consider a 2d system with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "the sample contains @xmath10 particles interacting with a triangular sinusoidal substrate containing @xmath11 potential minima .",

    "@xmath29 is the amplitude of the substrate potential .",
    "the initial colloid positions are obtained by simulated annealing , where the colloids start in a high temperature molten state and are gradually cooled to a finite temperature or to @xmath30 .",
    "we have also considered other initialization procedures , including placing a commensurate number of colloids in each substrate minima and letting the system relax .",
    "this procedure gives very similar initial states as the simulated annealing , especially for strong substrates ; however , for weaker substrates the configuration obtained through simulated annealing is generally more disordered , as we discuss in more detail later .",
    "after annealing , we investigate the transport properties by applying an external drive @xmath31 .",
    "we increment @xmath32 from @xmath33 to some final value in steps of @xmath34 , and we wait @xmath35 simulation time steps between increments to avoid transient effects .",
    "the depinning threshold is obtained by measuring the average colloid velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is modified according to the strength of the substrate . for weaker substrates we use smaller values of @xmath37 in order to obtain an accurate depinning threshold .",
    "we first consider the cases @xmath39 , 4 , and @xmath40 .",
    "earlier numerical studies addressed the statics and dynamics for @xmath41 and @xmath42 and showed that for strong triangular substrates , @xmath41 produced a herringbone state that transitioned under an applied drive into an aligned ferromagnetic state where the particles move in 1d channels @xcite . for weaker substrates a triangular lattice formed and the depinning was elastic , while for intermediate substrate strengths the depinning was plastic and the herringbone state depinned into a fluctuating state that reordered at higher drives .",
    "there was a strong increase in the critical depinning force between the elastic and plastic depinning regimes similar to the peak effect phenomenon found at the transition between elastic and plastic depinning for vortices in type - ii superconductors .",

    "<S> we examine the statics and dynamics of particles with repulsive yukawa interactions in the presence of a two - dimensional triangular substrate for fillings of up to twelve particles per potential minimum . </S>",
    "<S> we term the ordered states yukawa cluster crystals and show that they are distinct from the colloidal molecular crystal states found at low fillings . as a function of substrate and interaction strength at fixed particle density we find a series of novel crystalline states that we characterize using the structure factor . for fillings greater than four , </S>",
    "<S> shell and ring structures form at each potential minimum and can exhibit sample - wide orientational order . </S>",
    "<S> a disordered state can appear between ordered states as the substrate strength varies . under an external drive , </S>",
    "<S> the onsets of different orderings produce clear changes in the critical depinning force , including a peak effect phenomenon that has generally only previously been observed in systems with random substrates . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a rich variety of dynamic ordering transitions that can be observed via changes in the structure factor and features in the velocity - force curves . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical states encompass a variety of moving structures including one - dimensional stripes , smectic ordering , polycrystalline states , triangular lattices , and symmetry locking states . despite the complexity of the system , </S>",
    "<S> we identify several generic features of the dynamical phase transitions which we map out in a series of phase diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> our results have implications for the structure and depinning of colloids on periodic substrates , vortices in superconductors and bose - einstein condensates , wigner crystals , and dusty plasmas . </S>"
