    "critical phenomena at perfect , flat surfaces of three - dimensional systems have been the subject of intensive research during the last three decades @xcite . for the three - dimensional semi - infinite ising model two different ferromagnetic couplings",
    "are usually introduced , depending on whether the neighbouring spins are both located at the surface , @xmath0 , or not , @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is well established .",
    "if the ratio of the surface coupling @xmath2 to the bulk coupling @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is sufficiently small , the system undergoes at the bulk critical temperature @xmath5 an ordinary transition , with the bulk and surface ordering occurring at the same temperature . beyond a critical ratio , @xmath6 @xcite , the surface orders at a higher temperature @xmath7 at the surface transition , followed by the extraordinary transition of the bulk at @xmath5 . at the critical ratio @xmath8 ,",
    "one encounters the multicritical special transition point .    the semi - infinite ising model with a flat surface",
    "may be considered to be a special case of a more complex wedge geometry where two planes meeting at an angle @xmath9 form an infinite edge .",
    "for @xmath10 the flat surface is recovered .",
    "cardy @xcite showed that at the ordinary transition edge critical exponents depending continuously on @xmath9 arise on purely geometrical grounds .",
    "for a given opening angle @xmath9 , however , the values of the critical exponents are expected to be universal and independent on microscopic details like the strengths of the coupling constants or the lattice type . whereas edge singularities at the ordinary transition have been studied intensively , especially in two dimensions @xcite , edge critical behaviour at the surface transition of three - dimensional ising models has been largely overlooked . at the surface transition the critical fluctuations are essentially of two - dimensional character .",
    "one may then argue that the edge should act like a local perturbation in a two - dimensional system .",
    "in analogy with exact results obtained for two - dimensional ising models with defect lines @xcite , intriguing nonuniversal edge critical behaviour is therefore expected .",
    "similarly , corner critical exponents depending on the details of the model should also be observed at the surface transition .    in this contribution ,",
    "i discuss results on edge and corner critical behaviour obtained in large - scale monte carlo simulations of three - dimensional ising models @xcite . after presenting some details of the simulations in the next section ,",
    "i then discuss edge and corner criticality at the ordinary ( section 3 ) and at the surface transition ( section 4 ) .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper .",
    "to introduce edges in ising magnets defined on simple cubic lattices , periodic boundary conditions along one axis , the @xmath11-axis , are applied .",
    "the remaining four free surfaces of the crystal may be oriented in various ways leading to different opening angles @xmath9 at the edges . as shown in figure 1 , pairs of ( 100 ) and (",
    "010 ) surfaces lead to four equivalent edges with opening angles @xmath12 .",
    "the intersection of ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces form two pairs of edges with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , see figure 2 . besides the bulk coupling @xmath3 and the surface coupling @xmath2 ,",
    "further couplings may be introduced @xcite : two neighbouring edge spins interact with the edge coupling @xmath15 , whereas an edge spin is coupled to its neighbouring surface spin by the edge - surface interaction @xmath16 . the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath17 with spins @xmath18 at sites @xmath19 . for the study of corners we use free boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "the couplings between corner spins and neighbouring edge spins are set equal to @xmath15 , thus regarding corners as endpoints of edges .",
    "the results presented in the following have been obtained with the efficient one - cluster - flip algorithm @xcite .",
    "systems with @xmath20 sites were considered , with @xmath21 being the number of sites in the planes perpendicular to the @xmath11-axis , and @xmath22 being the number of sites along that axis .",
    "@xmath23 ranged from 10 to 80 and @xmath22 from 10 to 640 .",
    "for the investigation of corner critical behaviour ising cubes with up to @xmath24 spins were simulated .",
    "as we aim at studying properties of systems with infinitely long edges , finite - size effects have to be monitored closely .",
    "the monte carlo system should be large enough to reproduce the thermodynamic values of the bulk and the surface magnetization sufficiently far away from the edge .",
    "in general , at a given temperature , edge quantities must be stable against enlargening the system size .",
    "the same holds for corner quantities .    an interesting quantity in systems without corners",
    "is the magnetization per site for lines parallel to the @xmath11-axis : @xmath25 the sum runs over the @xmath22 spins in a line , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being fixed .",
    "the brackets denote thermal averages . as usual , the absolute value is taken to avoid vanishing magnetizations for finite systems .    from the line magnetizations , various magnetizations of interest",
    "are obtained .",
    "the edge magnetization @xmath28 is identical to @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes an edge site .",
    "the surface magnetization results from the line magnetization in the center of a surface , whereas the bulk magnetization is given by the line magnetization in the middle of the crystal .",
    "the local magnetization @xmath31 may be obtained by computing the correlation function @xmath32 between topologically equivalent sites ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) with maximal separation distance . in this way",
    ", the corner magnetization of ising cubes with linear dimension @xmath23 is given by @xmath35 i refer to corner quantities by the subscript 3 ( indicating that three planes meet at this point ) , whereas edge quantities have the subscript 2 .",
    "in @xcite , cardy considered @xmath36-dimensional systems with @xmath37-dimensional hyperplanes meeting at an angle @xmath9 . at the bulk critical point local critical exponents changing continuously with @xmath9 are already obtained in mean - field approximation .",
    "cardy showed that all edge critical exponents can be obtained by combining bulk and surface critical exponents with a new angle dependent edge exponent .",
    "he also computed the value of this exponent in first order of an @xmath38 expansion . from the renormalization group point of view",
    ", the angle dependence has its origin in the invariance of the edge under rescaling .",
    "this makes the opening angle to a marginal variable , which may then lead to angle dependent local critical exponents .",
    "edge magnetizations computed by monte carlo simulations are plotted in figure 3 for four different opening angles : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( correponding to the free surface ) , with all coupling constants set equal to @xmath3 .",
    "only data presenting no noticeable finite - size dependences are displayed .",
    "this is achieved by studying systems with a large number of edge sites , the edge length being the crucial quantity @xcite .    at the ordinary transition ,",
    "the edge magnetizations vanish at the bulk critical temperature @xmath43 with a power law behaviour @xmath44 . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the critical exponent of the edge magnetization . in order to estimate @xmath45 ,",
    "one may study @xcite an effective temperature dependent exponent @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the reduced temperature .",
    "certainly , on approach to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 becomes the asymptotic exponent @xmath45 .",
    "very accurate monte carlo data are required to get reliable estimates for the critical exponents .",
    ".predictions for the edge magnetization critical exponents @xmath52 from various methods .",

    "critical phenomena may occur not only in the bulk but also at surfaces , edges , and corners .",
    "i have presented results of an extensive monte carlo study of edge and corner criticality in three - dimensional ising systems . at the ordinary transition , edge and corner critical exponents",
    "have been computed and compared to analytical predictions . whereas the critical exponents depend on the wedge angle",
    ", they do not depend on microscopic details as the strengths of the local couplings .",
    "this is different at the surface transition where coupling dependent edge and corner critical exponents are observed .",
    "this non - universal behaviour is understood by analogy with exact results on two - dimensional ising models with defect lines .",
