    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) , we have calculated this probability from computer simulations as well as in a straightforward analytical approximation , which is described in appendix [ appa ] .",

    "is determined by the backscattering probability @xmath39 , which is the probability of the moving particle to leave the trap through the same gap where it entered .",
    "we computed @xmath40 numerically by repeatedly injecting the particle through a specific gap and observing trough which gap it left the trap .",
    "the particles are initially situated at one entrance of a trap , and they are uniformly distributed in the respective phase space of this entrance , which consists of the position of a particle on the entrance line , @xmath41 , and of the sine of the angle between the velocity direction and an axis perpendicular to the entrance , @xmath42 . alternatively , @xmath40 can be determined from a single long trajectory . the backscattering probability obtained from our simulations",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) .",
    "the markovian approximation of machta and zwanzig eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz ] ) corresponds to a backscattering probability of @xmath43 .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath7 the numerically computed probability is significantly larger than @xmath43 , whereas for larger @xmath7 it is considerably smaller . the reduced probability for backward scattering at larger @xmath7 is in part due to collisionless flights across the trap .",
    "it is remarkable that the backscattering probability is different from @xmath43 even for gap sizes where the average number of collisions between inter - trap hops is large . at @xmath44 , where the backscattering probability reaches its maximum value of @xmath45 ,",
    "more than 17 collisions occur before the particle hops to the next trap and for @xmath46 , where @xmath40 is still close to @xmath47 , the number of collisions is greater than @xmath48 .",
    "correspondingly , the detailed functional form of @xmath40 appears to be quite intricate : below the maximum at @xmath44 there are at least three regions where @xmath40 decreases approximately linear in @xmath7 with different values of the slope .",
    "as the numerical results indicate , the function must eventually drop extremely sharply to @xmath49 .",
    "details of these regions are shown in the magnification included in the figure .",
    "the vertical lines separating different regions correspond to the respective lines separating regions of different slope in the main figure .",
    "a very close look reveals that the fine structure of all these different regions appears to be quite similar , however , we note that this structure is essentially within the range of our numerical errors .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the initial conditions in the @xmath50-plane leading to backscattering for a gap size of @xmath51 . here",
    ", the @xmath52-axis is parallel to the trap entrance and the origin is located at the center of the entrance .",
    "initial conditions were drawn at random from a uniform distribution in this plane and a dot was plotted whenever the particle left the trap through the same aperture where it entered .",
    "simulations at different densities yield similar pictures . the complicated , intertwined structure is reminiscent of a fractal set .",
    "the modifications of this structure by varying @xmath7 must be related to the changes seen in the function @xmath40 of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) .",
    "this may explain why , even on the coarse scale of [ fig4 ] ( a ) , @xmath40 is not a simple function of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the detailed changes of this fractal set may be reflected in the respective detailed changes of @xmath40 on the fine scale , as illustrated in the magnification .",
    "having the probability of backscattering @xmath40 we can now perform a second correction of the original machta - zwanzig diffusion coefficient eq .",
    "( [ eq : mz ] ) . for this purpose",
    ", we again assume that diffusion can be treated as a hopping process with a frequency @xmath16 over distances @xmath32 .",
    "we now inquire to which traps the particle can move by performing two jumps within a total time interval of @xmath53 .",
    "there are only two possibilities : either the particle suffers backscattering , that is , it goes back to its original trap and does not contribute to any actual displacement within @xmath53 , or it moves over a distance @xmath54 to the left or to the right of its original trap .",
    "thus , the corresponding diffusion coefficient reads @xmath55l_2 ^ 2}{8\\tau } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ 1-p_{\\rm bs}]3/2d_{mz}\\quad .",

    "( [ eq : mz ] ) , in fig.[fig4 ] ( b ) . for smaller @xmath7 ,",
    "the corrected diffusion coefficient approximates the numerically exact values quite well .",
    "thus , we conclude that the existence of backscattering is basically responsible for the machta - zwanzig argument overestimating diffusion for small values of @xmath7 . for larger @xmath7 eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) again improves the original machta - zwanzig approximation , like the previous approximation eq .",
    "( [ eq : cf ] ) , however , like this it yields much smaller results than the correct values .",
    "so far we have identified two different microscopic scattering mechanisms which were not included in the original machta - zwanzig approximation for the diffusion coefficient , and which evidently play a significant role for understanding the full density - dependent diffusion coefficient : namely , the probability of collisionless flights across a trap leading to the diffusion coefficient of eq.([eq : cf ] ) , and the probability of backscattering leading to eq.([eq : bs ] ) .",
    "consequently , one may think of combining these two different approximations within a single diffusion coefficient formula .",
    "this can be performed by simply replacing the machta - zwanzig diffusion coefficient @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) by @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cf ] ) yielding @xmath57[1 + 2p_{\\rm cf}]d_{mz } \\quad .",

    "@xmath7 , this combined approximation is much closer to the numerical results than the original machta - zwanzig formulation , however , there still remains a notable quantitative difference .    in the same figure , corrections of higher order based on the idea of eq .",
    "( [ eq : comb ] ) are depicted . in the following we just outline the basic concept ,",
    "the detailed formulas are then given in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "the higher - order corrections of the diffusion coefficient are obtained by numerically computing the probabilities of higher - order backscattering , and by building them into a respectively generalized version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) .",
    "this generalized expression of the backscattering diffusion coefficient @xmath56 is then combined with the respective collisionless flight - diffusion coefficient @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cf ] ) in the same way as before .",
    "the probabilities of higher - order backscattering have been computed on the basis of a simple symbolic dynamics , as it can be defined in case of simple backscattering : we followed a long trajectory of a particle in the lorentz gas .",
    "for each visited trap we labeled the entrances through which the particle entered with @xmath58 , the exit to the left of this entrance with @xmath32 , and the one to the right with @xmath59 .",
    "thus , a trajectory in the lorentz gas can be mapped to a sequence of symbols @xmath60 , and @xmath59 .",
    "note that the symbolic dynamics we are using here is different to the one applied in other work in that we are labeling the three gaps of a trap , whereas in previous work the single disks accessible after a collision have been chosen , which required an alphabet of 12 symbols @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 is then the backscattering probability depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) , whereas , due to symmetry , @xmath62 corresponds to forward scattering .",
    "combining these probabilities with the correction by collisionless flights yields eq .",
    "( [ eq : comb ] ) as a first order approximation .",
    "higher - order correlations can be calculated by taking into account the probabilities of longer symbol sequences .",
    "for example , the second order approximation involves probabilities corresponding to nine symbol sequences each consisting of two symbols , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in complete analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : comb ] ) , a respective second - order approximation of the diffusion coefficient is then computed on the basis of these numerical probabilities , and by associating to them the respective distances traveled within a time interval of @xmath72 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2 ] ) . in the third - order approximation",
    "the probabilities correspond to sequences of three symbols , for example , three times backscattering within a time interval of @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath74 , etc . , and lead to the diffusion coefficient of eq.([eq : d3 ] ) . in general",
    ", the @xmath75-th order approximation involves the probability of sequences of @xmath75 symbols .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] ( a ) shows that by including such correlations the respective higher - order approximations of the diffusion coefficient converge , and basically move closer to the numerical exact results",
    ". however , for @xmath76 the approximations converge to the exact results apparently only globally , and not locally .",
    "a clear sign of this is that in third order the respective approximation already exceeds the numerical data for large @xmath7 , although the approximations seem to approach the exact data generically from below . on the other hand",
    ", one should take into account that this approximation scheme is based on a purely heuristical ansatz for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "thus , an exact convergence should not necessarily be expected .",
    "we therefore studied the effect of increased ( or decreased ) backscattering with the help of a lattice gas computer simulation .",
    "in such a simulation the lorentz gas is mapped to a honeycomb lattice where the sites of the lattice represent the traps .",
    "the moving particle hops from site to site with frequency @xmath16 , which is identical to the exact hopping frequency used in machta - zwanzig theory .",
    "we first describe the first order approximation : at each step the particle hops back to the site where it came from with probability @xmath40 or to one of the other sites with probability @xmath77 .",
    "the backscattering probability @xmath40 used in the lattice gas simulations is the one numerically obtained from simulations in the lorentz gas .",
    "also in the lattice gas simulations we determine the diffusion coefficient from the einstein formula eq.([eq : einst ] ) .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig.[fig6 ] ( b ) by a dotted line .",
    "taking into account these first order correlations brings the diffusion coefficient closer to the correct value , but there still is a considerable deviation .",
    "this indicates the importance of higher order correlations .",
    "these higher order correlations can be obtained by correlating more than two hops between neighboring traps . to determine the diffusion coefficient for such multiple hopping events by lattice gas simulations we used the probabilities @xmath78 calculated up to fourth order from long trajectories in the lorentz gas .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the diffusion coefficient obtained from this scheme converges very quickly to the numerically exact results , in particular for small @xmath7 . for larger @xmath7 , the convergence is somewhat slower , however , the fourth order approximation can be hardly distinguished from the numerically exact results on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) . for",
    "growing order the diffusion coefficient converges to the correct results exactly .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed how the machta - zwanzig theory can be improved systematically .",
    "an alternative approach for understanding diffusion in the lorentz gas may be obtained from kinetic theory , which essentially applies at low densities . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the boltzmann approximation for the random lorentz gas , where the scatterers are distributed randomly in the plane without overlap , has been used to compute the diffusion coefficient to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the collision length of the moving particle . at higher number densities",
    "@xmath8 the excluded volume of the scatterers becomes important , and the respective shorter collision length reads @xmath81 where we have changed to units with @xmath3 and @xmath5 . the same result for the collision length can be obtained directly from the machta - zwanzig argument of section ii @xcite . in case of the periodic lorentz gas @xmath8",
    "is related to the gap size @xmath7 by eq.([eq : nd ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath10 , where the particle is trapped , the corresponding density is @xmath82 and the collision length is still finite .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : dbp ] ) implies a diffusion coefficient of @xmath83 , that is , this approximation inevitably leads to an offset between @xmath84 and the exact result of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , it can immediately be concluded that @xmath86 is not correct at the highest densities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbp ] ) is shown in comparison to the numerically exact results and to the machta - zwanzig approximation eq.([eq : mz ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient has been plotted as a function of @xmath87 , and an offset of @xmath88 has been subtracted from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbp ] ) . according to this equation",
    ", @xmath89 should go linear in @xmath87 with a slope of @xmath90 , and the offset @xmath91 is the only fit parameter .",
    "indeed , fig.[fig7 ] shows that , on a sufficiently coarse scale and over a wide range of lower densities , @xmath15 matches quite well to this functional form .",
    "in particular , the value of the slope appears to be almost exact . only for larger densities",
    "@xmath15 deviates from linearity in @xmath87",
    ". however , here the machta - zwanzig approximation seems to describe the functional form at least qualitatively quite well .    from a conceptual point of view one",
    "may inquire why a boltzmann description should at all be applicable to the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "the basic difficulty is that because of the occurrence of an infinite horizon , a diffusion coefficient exists in the periodic lorentz gas only in the regime of very high densities , where a simple boltzmann approximation may not necessarily be expected to work .",
    "we first remark that in a lorentz gas there are no density corrections due to screening of particles , or to many - particle collisions , as they are contained in an enskog equation @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of an offset at large densities may be related to the fact that the boltzmann approximation represents only the first term in a series expansion in @xmath8 , which is known as the density expansion of kinetic theory . for the random lorentz gas ,",
    "such a density expansion has been carried out explicitly in refs .",
    "it has been found that there exist higher - order terms being logarithmic in the density corresponding to so - called ring collisions , which diminish the boltzmann diffusion coefficient quantitatively . however , these logarithmic corrections are difficult to see in the functional form of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is not known to us whether a density expansion has been performed for the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "but the offset we find might be associated to the existence of such higher - order corrections in the density , and the apparent boltzmann - like linear behavior may be related to the observation that in similar systems higher - order corrections do not change the functional form of the diffusion coefficient in a drastic way .",
    "because of the functional relation between number density @xmath8 and gap size @xmath7 eq .  ( [ eq : nd ] ) , and according to the boltzmann approximation eq .",
    "( [ eq : dbp ] ) , there should exist a respective approximate linear dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 on @xmath7 , as can in fact be seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the quadratic term in @xmath7 which appears in eq.([eq : nd ] ) turns out to be quantitatively at most @xmath92 for largest @xmath7 , and , after a proper adjustment , can not be seen as any deviation to a linearity in @xmath7 .",
    "to learn more about the very detailed dependence of @xmath15 on the density @xmath8 , or alternatively on the gap size @xmath7 , we performed further computer simulations in the region of large @xmath7 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . here ,",
    "the respective residuals of @xmath15 have been plotted , that is , the deviation of the diffusion coefficients from a linear fit in @xmath7 over the whole region shown in the figure . at each value of @xmath7 ten independent runs of more than @xmath93 collisions each",
    "have been carried out yielding the diffusion coefficients shown by the dots .",
    "the squares correspond to the averages over the ten runs , where the size of the squares indicates the size of the numerical error .",
    "[ fig8 ] may be regarded as a signature of long - range correlations in microscopic scattering events .",
    "a certain subclass of such scattering events are the ring collisions mentioned above leading to a series of logarithmic corrections , and divergences , in the density expansion of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it might be conjectured that the existence of these divergences in the density expansion of kinetic theory is due to the problem of approximating a diffusion coefficient , which is in fact a function as complicated as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , in form of a simple series expansion , as has already been remarked in ref .",
    "we have numerically computed the density dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the two - dimensional periodic lorentz gas .",
    "a comparison of our results with the analytical approximation of machta and zwanzig shows that their argument is only asymptotically correct in the limit of high densities .",
    "we have furthermore discussed how their approximation can be corrected systematically by including correlations in the hopping mechanism .    as an alternative way to understand the structure of the density - dependent diffusion coefficient",
    ", we compared our numerical results to a simple boltzmann approximation .",
    "we found that on a coarse scale there exists a dynamical crossover from a function linear in @xmath87 for lower densities , as qualitatively be described by the boltzmann diffusion coefficient , to a behavior at high densities which can qualitatively be understood by the machta - zwanzig argument .",
    "our two different points of view of understanding the density - dependent diffusion coefficient - namely , on the basis of the machta - zwanzig argument , and by a boltzmann approximation - , are not at all contradictory .",
    "the complicated microscopic scattering processes responsible for the failure of the machta - zwanzig approximation apparently just superpose in a way such that the resulting diffusion coefficient is approximately linear in @xmath87 on a coarse scale . a similar relation between nonlinear corrections and a linear response has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite with respect to the existence of ohm s law in a periodic lorentz gas with an external field . that this picture is too simple is demonstrated by the fact that on a very fine scale we find deviations from such a simple linear behavior .",
    "these tiny fluctuations may be regarded as the signature of specific microscopic correlated scattering processes in the deterministic diffusion coefficient .",
    "a dynamical crossover between different asymptotic laws for a parameter - dependent diffusion coefficient has already been found and discussed in related periodic one - dimensional chaotic maps @xcite . as in our discussion above , for these maps two different random walk models have been used to describe the corresponding asymptotic behavior : for small parameters , the respective random walk basically depends on the hopping probability of a particle leaving a cell , thus corresponding to the machta - zwanzig approximation , whereas for larger parameters the respective random walk scales with the distance a particle travels per time step , thus corresponding to the boltzmann approximation , where diffusion is proportional to the collision length of the moving particle .",
    "we furthermore note that the diffusion coefficients in this kind of maps have been found to be fractal with respect to variation of the control parameter , and that specific correlated microscopic scattering events could be identified as being responsible for this fractal structure @xcite .",
    "the same phenomena have been encountered in related two - dimensional multi - baker maps , which are simple toy models of the periodic lorentz gas @xcite .",
    "whether the density - dependent diffusion coefficient of the periodic lorentz gas is in fact a non - differentiable function of the parameter , as it is the case for the one - dimensional maps discussed above , remains an open problem .",
    "it seems to us that this question can not be answered by performing straightforward computer simulations , but that , instead , more refined techniques to compute the diffusion coefficient are necessary , as they have been developed , for example , in ref.@xcite in case of one - dimensional maps .",

    "it says that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the area of the trap , @xmath96 is the measure of the velocity space of the trap , @xmath97 is the region of the boundary of the trap across which collisionless flights are possible , @xmath3 is the velocity of the moving particle , @xmath33 is the average time at which a particle leaves the trap , and @xmath98 is the average flux of particles with velocity @xmath99 parallel to the normal @xmath100 at one entrance , with @xmath101 being the angle between @xmath100 and @xmath99 , and @xmath102 being the invariant probability distribution of @xmath101 in equilibrium .",

    "the relevant variables for this purpose , and the geometry , are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , where , because of symmetry , we have reduced the problem to one entrance . in a second approximation",
    ", we assume that regions of size @xmath106 , as the one indicated in the figure , are the only parts of the boundary which contribute to free flights .",
    "@xmath106 is precisely defined as the section on the entrance line between the two horizontal lines which touch the upper scatterer tangentially , and which go from the lower edge of the left entrance to the lower edge of the right entrance , respectively .",
    "because of symmetry , there are six regions like this for each trap leading to @xmath107 .",

    "( [ eq : e ] ) , @xmath111 marks just the onset of the existence of collisionless flights with respect to varying @xmath7 .",
    "it now remains to compute the flux @xmath103 in these regions . to do this , we need to know the limits of the integral in eq.([eq : phi ] ) . as a very crude approximation",
    ", we assume that these boundaries are determined by the angles @xmath112 and @xmath113 such that @xmath114 here , @xmath115 is identical to the angle between a horizontal velocity vector @xmath99 and the normal @xmath100 of the entrance .",

    "( [ eq : comb ] ) , where this equation represents already the first order correction . the basic idea of these corrections is discussed in section [ hoc ] .",
    "the underlying picture for all these approximations is the machta - zwanzig assumption of diffusion as a hopping process with frequency @xmath16 on a hexagonal lattice of traps , where the lattice sites are separated by a distance of @xmath32 .",
    "we use in the following the symbolic dynamics introduced in section [ hoc ] to denote the transition probabilities of a particle which hops from one initial trap to some other trap on the lattice within a certain time interval of multiples of @xmath33 . for the particular time interval of @xmath72 , we find that the particle can move +  with a probability @xmath118 over a distance @xmath119 +  with a probability @xmath120 over a distance @xmath121 +  with a probability @xmath122 over a distance @xmath123 .",
