    "there is now convincing evidence that the evolution of large - scale structure is driven by intergalactic dark matter . understanding the nature of this dark matter remains one of the major unsolved problems in astronomy .",
    "it is for this reason that mapping the overall mass distribution , independent of the distribution of luminous matter in galaxies , must be considered a fundamental endeavor in cosmological research .",
    "unfortunately , few tools are available for the purpose : weak gravitational lensing can trace , statistically , the presence of intervening dark matter at large distances , and x - ray emitting gas can be used to map the gravitational potential of the dark matter that binds rich clusters . however , for a point - by - point comparison of the density of dark and luminous matter , measuring peculiar velocities  departures from pure hubble flow caused by an uneven distribution of dark matter  is the only effective method available .",
    "using galaxies as test particles to sample the local gravitational field requires accurate knowledge of their positions in space , because galaxy motions are dominated by the expansion of the universe for all but the closest objects .",
    "since most methods deliver an accuracy that ( at best ) scales proportionately with the distance , there is a premium on more accurate distance measurements driven by the desire to measure peculiar velocities over a large volume of space .",
    "the peculiar velocity that is known best , by far , is the 370  motion of our sun with respect to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , known with exquisite accuracy from the cobe measurement of the cmb dipole anisotropy , which is then converted with less certainty to the @xmath12  motion of our local group of galaxies with respect to the cmb .",
    "a study of peculiar velocities for other galaxies in the local universe can be thought of as an exercise with two complementary aims : ( 1 ) to map the dark matter distribution in the local universe and compare it with the local galaxy distribution ( in the process , measuring a representative value of the cosmic density parameter @xmath9 ) and ( 2 ) to account for our galaxy s motion as the consequence of anisotropies of the dark matter distribution .",
    "such knowledge has application in interpreting large - scale structure inferred from the galaxy distribution alone , and to measuring the degree and nature of `` bias '' that may exist between the dark and luminous matter distributions , so important for testing theoretical models of structure formation .",
    "in addition , it is likely that a detailed comparison of the dark - matter / baryon / galaxy distributions on the scale of the correlation length for galaxies will shed light on the processes of galaxy formation and the role of dark matter in that process .",
    "the observation of rubin  ( 1976 ) first raised the possibility of a large - scale deformation in the local hubble flow .",
    "unfortunately , the method of distance used in this pioneering work was too crude to fight its way through the malmquist - like systematic errors that are endemic to the field .",
    "the first solid detections of large - scale flows and inferred dark structures began around 1980 , including tonry ( 1980 ) , schechter ( 1980 ) , yahil  ( 1980 ) , aaronson  ( 1980 ) , tonry & davis ( 1981 ) , and aaronson  ( 1982 ) , using spiral and elliptical galaxies to map the local supercluster .",
    "all studies detected the infall pattern that was anticipated for a sizeable overdensity roughly centered on the virgo cluster , but with an amplitude at the position of the local group that ranged from 125  ( yahil  1980 ) to 480  ( aaronson  1980 ) .",
    "as we shall see , the flow within the virgo supercluster is much more complicated than these early models permitted , and this range of `` infall velocity '' is not surprising . on thing that was clear , however , was that in both amplitude and direction the pull of the local supercluster was insufficient to be the sole cause of the cmb dipole anisotropy , _",
    "i.e. , _ the motion of the milky way or local group with respect to the cmb .",
    "an additional pull , in the direction of the centaurus supercluster , implicated as well by the high galaxy density in this direction , was suggested by shaya ( 1984 ) , tammann & sandage ( 1985 ) , and aaronson  ( 1986 ) .",
    "of particular relevance for the discussion of our own results is the suggestion by lilje , yahil , & jones ( 1986 ) that the effect of this more distant mass can be seen as a quadrupole term in the peculiar velocity field of the local supercluster .",
    "based on a refined distance estimator for elliptical galaxies , actually a projection of the fundamental plane ( dressler  1987 , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , lynden - bell  ( 1988 ) used a sample of over 400 elliptical galaxies to map a much large volume of space .",
    "this study confirmed the infall pattern toward virgo , but credited a considerable fraction of the peculiar velocity measured for local galaxies to the quadrupole of a more distant mass concentration .",
    "surprisingly , however , the lynden - bell  study did not find the centaurus cluster to be the center of a more distant infall pattern , but put the center at a distance approximately 50% greater , with centaurus and its associated groups themselves falling into the more distant attractor at a velocity of order 1000  .",
    "the pull on the local group from this `` behind centaurus '' attractor was reckoned to be of order 500  , perhaps twice as big as the virgo pull but from a velocity distance of around 4000  , over three times as distant .",
    "the implied order - of - magnitude greater mass earned it the nickname `` great attractor '' ( ga ) .",
    "however , doubts have remained about whether the ga is indeed a well defined overdensity with such a large gravitational influence . while dressler & faber s ( 1990a , 1990b ) distance measurements of additional elliptical and spiral galaxies appeared to show the distinctive s - shaped pattern of infall , including `` backside infall , '' the larger spiral sample of mathewson , ford , & buckhorn ( 1992 ) did not . instead , these authors argued for a continuing high amplitude flow beyond the distance identified as the ga center , perhaps the result of a more distant gravitational pull , such as the `` giant attractor '' suggested by scaramella  ( 1989 ) associated with the shapley concentration of rich clusters , more than three times as distant as the ga .",
    "further evidence that the ga s role in producing the local flow pattern might have been overestimated is discussed by courteau ( 1993 ) .",
    "adding a more complete sample of spirals , particularly in the perseus - pisces region , led to this study s finding of a considerable amplitude `` bulk flow''that is , a non - converging flow whose source , if gravitational in origin , would be on a scale considerably larger than 6000  , a region encompassing the ga .",
    "however , a recent study of spiral galaxy distances by giovanelli  ( 1999 ) contradicts this result by claiming that all of the local group s motion with respect to the cmb can be accounted for by sources within the @xmath13 sphere .",
    "likewise , the type ia supernovae observations of riess , press , & kirshner ( 1995 ) suggest a more distant frame that is at rest with the cmb .    this lingering uncertainty in the sources of the local flow pattern ",
    "that is , the contribution of the local supercluster , the ga , perseus - pisces , the shapley concentration , and structures beyond  have been made all the more important by studies of lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , willick ( 1999 ) , and hudson  ( 1999 ) who find large , but not always consistent bulk flows , over even larger volumes of the local universe . indeed , these flows have amplitudes large enough , over such large volumes , that they appear inconsistent with the small scale anisotropy @xmath14 measured for cmb fluctuations .",
    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) of measuring early - type galaxy distances is perhaps the most promising means for understanding these issues and resolving the disagreements . a recent comprehensive review of the sbf method is given by blakeslee , ajhar , & tonry ( 1999 ) .",
    "sbf offers an accuracy several times greater than either tully - fisher or fundamental plane distances ; as a consequence , its susceptibility to malmquist - like biases is reduced by an order - of - magnitude .",
    "sbf also includes an implicit correction for variations in age and metal abundance , in the form of color term , which previous methods for measuring distances to elliptical galaxies did not include .",
    "the data we present here will have bearing on all the issues raised above , but they are limited to relatively nearby galaxies ( @xmath15 ) for all but a handful of observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "nevertheless , we hope to demonstrate in this paper the power and promise of the method for eventually producing a highly accurate map of the local distribution of dark matter , out to velocity distances of 10,000  or more , thereby answering the question `` over what scale does the motion of the local group with respect to the cmb arise ? ''    in this paper we will discuss the characteristics of our sbf data set and use the data to construct parametric models of the local flow pattern .",
    "we will show not only that the convergent flows into the local supercluster and great attractor dominate the departures from smooth hubble flow but also that the data are sufficiently accurate to provide other constraints on bulk flow , local voids , and other possible attractors .",
    "the combination of these two attractors and a moderate thermal component accounts for 90% of the variance in our sample .",
    "specifically , evidence for the ga comes not only from the large peculiar velocities in the centaurus direction but also from the clear quadrupole signature in the local supercluster flow , whose amplitude and direction are consistent with an order - of - magnitude larger mass concentration in the centaurus direction .",
    "the amplitude and scale of these two flows are consistent with low-@xmath9 cosmologies and with the measured small - scale anisotropy of the cmb .",
    "we extensively explore the covariances between various model parameters , such as the attractor distances and amplitudes , the hubble parameter , and the overall bulk flow .",
    "the uncertainties will greatly diminish when additional  sbf measurements spanning the ga region are available .",
    "a future paper will discuss more detailed models for the ga and compare our results to previous works , including a point - by - point comparison of sbf and lynden - bell  distances .",
    "in addition , while we have chosen on this first examination of our data to use _ only _ the peculiar velocity information inherent in the sbf distances and to completely ignore the distribution of galaxies , we intend in future papers to compare the sbf peculiar velocities in detail with the galaxy density field .",
    "the first paper of this series ( tonry  1997 , hereafter sbf - i ) described the galaxy sample and observations of the sbf survey in detail and gave a new calibration of the method . that calibration was derived by comparing averaged sbf measurements within 7 galaxy groups to cepheid distances to spirals purportedly within the same groups .",
    "it gave an absolute magnitude @xmath16 at our fiducial early - type galaxy color of @xmath17 .",
    "the alternative , direct calibration from sbf measurements for 5 cepheid - bearing galaxies gave a brighter zero point of @xmath18 .",
    "as these two zero points agreed within the uncertainty , and because of the potential for systematic differences arising from the relative difficulty of sbf measurements in spiral bulges , we felt more secure in adopting the group calibration .    for a number of reasons",
    "it has become necessary to revise the calibration yet again .",
    "first of all , we wish to incorporate all the latest  cepheid distances , and we adopt the values as tabulated by ferrarese  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors have made a number of small revisions to the earlier results for purposes of homogeneity .",
    "a bigger change is that we have switched to the new extinctions of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd ) , which are determined from the cobe / dirbe and iras / issa dust maps .",
    "these have better spatial resolution , uniformity , and accuracy than the old estimates derived from hi maps ( burstein & heiles 1984 , hereafter bh ) .",
    "while there is a good correlation between the two sets of reddening estimates , there is also a significant zero - point offset .",
    "sfd find a mean extinction that is greater by 0.02  mag in @xmath19 than that of burstein and heiles .",
    "therefore when we correct our sbf magnitudes and colors according to these new extinctions , our  zero point should change .    increasing the extinction estimate to any given galaxy ( while keeping a fixed calibration ) causes the sbf distance to that galaxy to increase .",
    "this is due to the sensitivity of  to  color ; if the extinction is changed by @xmath20 , the distance modulus changes by @xmath21 \\times \\delta e(b{-}v)\\ , ,   \\label{eq : dmm}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the ratios of the total @xmath24 and @xmath25 band extinctions to the selective @xmath19 extinction . for the average increase of @xmath26 in going from bh to sfd extinctions ,",
    "we find a mean @xmath27 mag .",
    "however , if all the calibrator galaxies underwent this same average shift in extinction , then the zero point we would derive through comparison with the cepheids would change by @xmath28mag , and our overall distance scale would not change .",
    "this is basically the case for the group - derived calibration , which now gives @xmath29 from a total of 6 groups .",
    "however , the direct cepheid - galaxy calibration did not change , since the mean bh and sfd extinctions towards these spirals are the same . for m31 , which is excluded from the sfd map , we follow bianchi  ( 1996 ) and ferrarese  ( 1999 ) in adopting the bh value of @xmath30 , and then we use the sfd extinction ratios for consistency .",
    "thus , the galaxy calibration still gives a weighted average of @xmath31 , from 6 individual comparisons now , and a median of @xmath16 .",
    "the group and galaxy calibrations have diverged from a 0.08  mag difference in sbf - i to a 0.130.19  mag difference with the sfd extinctions .",
    "in contrast to the approach of sbf - i , we have decided to adopt the direct galaxy calibration rather than the group calibration .",
    "this fairly major shift is inspired by new worries that the cepheid - bearing spirals may be systematically in the foreground for virgo and other groups ( see ferrarese  1999 ) . since we are not confident about the formal error estimates for either the spiral sbf or cepheid distances , we adopt the median rather than the weighted average of the spiral zero points .",
    "this new calibration is within 0.07  mag of the theoretical calibration from stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) ( see discussions by sbf - i and blakeslee  1999 ) .",
    "the new sbf calibration derived with all the latest measurements and the sfd extinctions and used in this paper is @xmath32 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : newcal}\\ ] ] it is slightly fainter than the sbf calibration of ferrarese  for two reasons : they used the extinction ratios from cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) whereas we have used the ones recommended by sfd , and we have used a median rather than an average . despite the numerical coincidence of our new calibration with sbf - i , the change due to the increase in average extinction [ eq .  ( [ eq : dmm ] ) ] means that our distance moduli increase on average by @xmath330.1 mag .",
    "we provide complete details about our choice of zero point in appendix b.    finally , the survey data reductions were not yet complete at the time of sbf - i . in particular , we have added a large body of new measurements from the 2.4 m las campanas telescope that were generally taken under superior conditions and have enabled us to improve some distances . from detailed comparisons of these new data to older , poorer quality data , we discovered that bad data sometimes yield spurious sbf signals .",
    "we have found two simple quantities useful in comparing data qualities : @xmath34 , where  is the full - width at half - maximum of the point spread function in arcseconds and @xmath35 is the cmb velocity in units of 1000 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of electrons that would be detected in the image from an object of magnitude @xmath38 ( estimated from the cmb velocity ) , and @xmath39 is proportional to the metric area within a resolution element , hence the number of stars for fixed surface brightness .",
    "when @xmath40 or @xmath41 , the observation is marked as unreliable and ignored ( see  [ ssec : bias ] ) .",
    "for multiple observations of a given galaxy , we adopt a weighted average if the difference in  is less than 0.3 or if each individual observation has @xmath42 ; otherwise , we reject the observation with the larger .",
    "the entire sbf survey data set will be published in a forthcoming supplementary paper ( tonry  1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "we incorporate eight distances from  sbf observations : four from lauer  ( 1998 ) , ngc  4373 from pahre  ( 1999 ) , and three from our cycle 6 program ( dressler  1999 ) .",
    "we have adjusted these distances slightly from the published ones to agree with the sfd extinctions and have revised the zero point from ajhar  ( 1997 ) to agree with our new @xmath25-band zero point .",
    "although the results presented here do not change significantly when the  data are included , they do become more robust to covariances between , for example , @xmath1 and infall amplitudes .",
    "when we compare these  distances with the difficult ground - based efforts beyond 3000  or so , we find that there may be a bias in the ground - based data that correlates with .",
    "typical ground - based data for more nearby galaxies agree well with  measurements ( ajhar 1997 ; see also the discussion by blakeslee  1999 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath43 we find that @xmath44 ranges between 1 and 0.8 , but we do not have enough  observations to be confident that this is the onset of a bias in the ground - based data . if it truly is a bias , we believe the source could have origins including unresolved dust and structure , unresolved color gradients , and instrumental effects , and we can not predict reliably when it may be present . we therefore restrict ourselves to @xmath45 .",
    "when we fit our models to subsets of the data with different  cuts , we find no change in the parameters to within the errors for @xmath46 , which gives us confidence that we are not affected by a distance - dependent bias .    as in sbf - i , we try to estimate the accuracy of our error estimates by looking at the scatter within groups .",
    "since we do not know the radial extent of groups , we ask how much cosmic scatter in @xmath47 is necessary if the groups have no radial depth at all , and find the answer is 0.10 mag .",
    "conversely , if we assume that groups have the same depth as breadth then the sbf cosmic scatter is 0.06 mag . including this 0.06 mag of cosmic scatter in , the quartiles of the distribution in error in sbf distance modulus are 0.17 , 0.21 , and 0.29 mag , so",
    "this is a fairly sensitive test that the sbf error estimates are accurate .",
    "( note that these errors are dominated by the observational compromises inherent in doing such a large survey on relatively small telescopes ; in almost all cases the distances could be significantly improved . )",
    "because the differential volume increases with distance , there will be more galaxies scattered down in distance by the errors than are scattered up .",
    "the level of this malmquist - like bias in our sample is difficult to quantify .",
    "we have the usual problem of not knowing what the true distribution of galaxies is , and we may also be subject to possible biases and selection effects which depend on distance .",
    "we try to minimize these effects by tailoring our exposure times and seeing conditions to the distance of the galaxy we are observing . in addition , we are not actually sampling a population that increases rapidly with distance ( mostly we tend to be seeing early - type galaxy in groups ) .",
    "nevertheless , if we calculate the @xmath48 correction ( lynden - bell  1988 ) for the median error , we get a bias factor of 1.038 . including this correction in the models described below does not change the results , and in fact it slightly increases the @xmath49 values .",
    "the level of bias due to the irreducible cosmic scatter in  is very small .",
    "we preferentially measure galaxies to be too close because of their cosmic scatter at the 0.3% level ( assuming 0.06 mag of cosmic scatter ) .",
    "moreover , unlike the case for other methods , such as the `` forward '' tully - fisher relation , @xmath50-@xmath51/fundamental plane , or snia , that use some of the same observables ( magnitude , effective radius , surface brightness ) for the distance measurement as were used in the selection , the cosmic scatter in the -  relation is not known to correlate with any observables measuring galaxy size or luminosity .",
    "the bottom line is that we can safely ignore bias correction for cosmic scatter , and because the dubiously applicable malmquist bias factor of @xmath331.04 yields no measurable improvement , we ignore it .",
    "the galaxy velocities come from zcat ( huchra  1992 , version dated 1998 november 23 ) , and are converted to the cmb frame according to lineweaver  ( 1996 ) , and to the local group frame as defined by yahil  ( 1977 ) .",
    "( a recent study by courteau & van den bergh 1999 finds almost exactly the same local group reference frame . )",
    "there are 336 galaxies in our sample , which is reduced to 295 after applying the @xmath52 cut .",
    "we restrict another 10 of these from contributing to the model fits , three because we think the sbf distance may be in error despite passing the  cut , and seven because their velocities are quite discordant with our model velocity distribution function .",
    "the former cases include a messy galaxy at fairly low galactic latitude with marginal seeing ( ngc  6305 ) , and galaxies with extremely blue color where we do not believe our calibration is reliable ( ngc  5253 and ic  4182 ) .",
    "the latter cases include three galaxies in cen-45 ( ngc  4709 , ngc  4616 , and d  45 ) , ngc  1400 ( the high velocity companion of ngc  1407 in eridanus ) , ngc  4150 ( a coma  i galaxy with a very low velocity ) , and ngc  4578 and ngc  4419 , which we think have just passed through virgo at high speed and therefore have extremely unusual velocities for their location .",
    "in this paper we shall limit ourselves to a simple , parametric model for the velocity field of galaxies .",
    "in addition , we try to avoid _ all _ group information .",
    "the assignment of galaxies to groups has had a checkered history , and we prefer to deal with the virial velocities directly , rather than trying to average them away .",
    "there are two methods commonly used for constructing a merit function for a peculiar velocity model @xmath53 .",
    "the first is to assemble @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the uncertainty in position expressed in units of , @xmath57 is the ( small ) uncertainty in the measurement of velocity , and @xmath58 is an allowance for thermal or virial velocity dispersion ( cf .",
    "hudson  1997 ) .",
    "this tacitly assumes that the slope @xmath59 everywhere , otherwise it is not correct to use distance error @xmath56 in the denominator .",
    "this can be very problematic for a model which has a significant disturbance to the hubble flow , for example in the local supercluster .",
    "it is possible to `` correct '' @xmath56 by a spatially varying @xmath60 , but then this @xmath49 is no longer maximum likelihood ( unless it includes the often neglected @xmath61 term ) and will tend to bias parameters in such a way as to maximize @xmath62 . the other weakness of this approach is that it involves some arbitrariness of when objects should be grouped and what virial velocity @xmath58 should be allocated for them .    the second common method ( e.g. , davis , strauss , & yahil 1991 ; strauss  1992 ; shaya , tully , & pierce 1992 ) is to invert the velocity model and use the observed velocity to provide a model distance which can be compared with the observed distance .",
    "this has the advantage that it compares the distances and model directly , but it has the disadvantage that it can not cleanly deal with virial velocities , necessitating grouping to the point that virial velocity is reduced to a negligible magnitude compared to the flow velocity and distance error .",
    "it also has the disadvantage that the inversion of @xmath53 can be multiple valued , and is necessarily multiple valued in the regions of space where a supercluster flow is most prominently seen .",
    "one is then forced to an arbitrary or probabilistic choice of which model distance to use .",
    "what we have chosen to do is to accept the fact that there is a distribution function of galaxy velocity which varies from place to place , both in mean velocity ( large scale flow ) and in dispersion .",
    "our models consist of a velocity distribution function at each location , @xmath63 , which we take to be gaussian of mean @xmath64 and dispersion @xmath65 . a given distance measurement , itself a probability distribution , is multiplied by this model distribution function and integrated over distance , giving a velocity probability distribution .",
    "the merit function is then the likelihood , the product of these velocity distributions evaluated at the observed velocities .",
    "the components of our model for the mean velocity @xmath64 include a hubble flow of amplitude @xmath1 , an constant dipole velocity @xmath66 , possibly a quadrupole @xmath67 with zero trace which acts like an anisotropic hubble constant , a density parameter @xmath9 for the universe , and attractors which are assumed to be spherical power laws in density with a core and cutoff radius .",
    "the positions of these attractors can be free parameters as well as the power - law exponent , the core and cutoff radii , and the overall normalization .",
    "our model for the velocity dispersion as a function of position , @xmath65 , consists of the quadrature sum of an overall thermal velocity , a virial component at the center of each attractor , and possibly other ( non - attracting ) virial components at the locations of groups such as the fornax cluster .",
    "these components have a velocity dispersion which varies spatially as @xmath68 . in principle",
    "we have enough distance accuracy to constrain both the background thermal component and these virial components ( except for ga / centaurus at the limit of our survey ) with a smoothing length of perhaps 4  mpc . in practice",
    "we fit only for the thermal background and virgo velocity dispersions and put in by hand the fornax ( 235 ) and centaurus ( 500 ) dispersions with @xmath69  mpc .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use a thermal velocity dispersion of 187 , which is the best - fit value in our most refined models .",
    "figure [ fig : probs ] illustrates how this works .",
    "the model @xmath63 is shown along a line of sight near the virgo cluster .",
    "the mean velocity has a hubble flow term modified by a peculiar velocity which grows approximately as @xmath70 ( for an @xmath71 density distribution ) , but then rolls off to zero at the center of the cluster because of the core radius in the density distribution .",
    "the velocity dispersion at each location consists of the quadrature sum of the thermal background component and a cluster velocity dispersion with an amplitude of about 650 , which declines away from the virgo cluster as a gaussian of width 2  mpc .",
    "again , these parameters are all variable components of the velocity model .    with three shape parameters ( power - law slope and core and cutoff radii ) ,",
    "our attractor models have much radial flexibility .",
    "the models can emulate anything from a centrally concentrated mass to an extended distribution with divergent total mass .",
    "the question of spherical symmetry is harder to justify .",
    "we note , however , that the galaxy distribution in the virgo supercluster is not completely flat , that the potential is much rounder than a mass distribution , and that the large scale flows we see today arise from the time integral of the potential so that a spherical model might represent the velocity data quite well even though the potential is today significantly flattened .",
    "moreover , we do allow for the possibility of a quadrupole correction to the flow model , and this can start to modify a spherical flow into a more flattened one",
    ". as we shall see , there are indications that the virgo attractor is not spherical .",
    "we convert a mass distribution to a peculiar velocity distribution using the usual non - linear `` nested friedmann universe '' model , where each mass shell evolves from the big bang according to its interior mass density .",
    "we do not do this computation exactly , however , but rather use the yahil ( 1985 ) `` @xmath72 law '' approximation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the radius of the shell and @xmath75 is the mean mass density interior to the shell in units of the background density .",
    "giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1993 ) examined this approximation with n - body simulations and found that it is remarkably accurate for @xmath76 , which is the range of interest here .",
    "we do not expect our models to be valid all the way into the virialized core of the attractor ( @xmath77 ) , so our velocity distribution function rolls over to zero in the mean at the centers of the attractors with a compensating rise in virial velocity dispersion .",
    "it is common to recast this parametrization in terms of a local overdensity and peculiar velocity , which then permits @xmath9 to be derived from this formula .",
    "however , because of our desire to avoid use of the galaxy distribution , we lack any a priori information about @xmath75 , and thus have very little constraint on @xmath9 . only the non - linear part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : upec ] ) provides any constraint at all , and clearly that is not going to be very reliable .",
    "instead , we choose a single value for @xmath9 and derive the overdensities for the model attractors from the fitted infall velocities .",
    "the input to our models includes for each galaxy the position on the sky , distance and error , and velocity .",
    "the fitting program reads these data and also accepts a variety of model components , including cosmology ( @xmath1 , @xmath9 , and dipole velocity @xmath66 ) , quadrupole ( five components plus origin and cutoff ) , extended attractors , thermal components , and compact attractors .",
    "the program computes a model velocity distribution function for each observed data point , evaluates the probability of the observed velocity given the velocity probability distribution , forms the likelihood sum from the probabilities @xmath78 : @xmath79 , and searches parameter space for a maximum in @xmath80 .",
    "the model velocity field consists of a mean velocity at each point and associated gaussian velocity dispersion .",
    "the hubble constant and dipole velocity give a contribution to the model velocity @xmath81 at @xmath82 of @xmath83 .",
    "the quadrupole contributes a velocity at @xmath84 of @xmath85 the quadrupole matrix is forced to zero trace by insisting that @xmath86 , which ensures that the monopole @xmath1 parameter carries the net hubble expansion proportional to distance .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the origin of the quadrupole , @xmath87 , is taken to be the local group , and the cutoff radius , @xmath88 is taken to be infinity .",
    "extended attractors are modeled by starting with spherical density distributions of the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the power - law exponent and @xmath91 is a core radius .",
    "this integrates nicely to give an enclosed mass function to which we append an exponential cutoff and divide by volume to get a mean enclosed overdensity : @xmath92 .",

    "we ordinarily normalize these attractors in terms of a velocity amplitude at our location by using the inverse of yahil s @xmath72 law to convert such a velocity into an expression for @xmath95 .",
    "the cutoff radius @xmath96 ensures that these models have zero net mass , hence do not bias @xmath1 high by making a net local modification to @xmath9 . for typical values of @xmath90 , @xmath96 is approximately where the density becomes negative and @xmath97 starts to decrease back to zero .",
    "the covariance between the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath98 makes it difficult to interpret values for any one parameter in isolation .",
    "we will strive to indicate what is well constrained by the models ( e.g. , mass of attractor , or run of peculiar velocity with radius ) and what is not .    as mentioned above , the model velocity dispersion consists of the quadrature sums of background and extended thermal components .",
    "each component has a velocity dispersion with a central value that falls off spatially according to a gaussian of width @xmath99 .",
    "these thermal components can either be specified explicitly ( the cosmic dispersion is taken to be centered on the origin with an infinite gaussian radius ; fornax is centered on the location of the fornax cluster and has a core radius of 2  mpc ) , or as part of an extended attractor .",
    "the thermal component of an extended attractor is centered on the attractor , has a parameter describing its central virial velocity dispersion , and shares the core parameter @xmath99 with the core radius @xmath91 of the mean infall .",
    "( we expect @xmath99 to be close to @xmath91 , and in our models we set the two radii to be the same . )",
    "it is also possible to specify `` compact attractors '' , density distributions which are gaussians .",
    "these carry five parameters , their location , their gaussian radius , and their amplitude .",
    "the amplitude is given in terms of the total mass and a fiducial radius , @xmath100  mpc : @xmath101 for a gaussian with @xmath102 , the enclosed mass is @xmath103 \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath104 .",
    "the expression for @xmath105 is converted to a @xmath75 and then used in eq .",

    "we make no attempt to create an overall self - consistent density and velocity distribution  these components do not interact with one another .",
    "having specified the various components , the mean velocity is just the sum of the contributions of all the components , and the velocity dispersion is the quadrature sum of the various contributors .",
    "once we have a model , we then go about evaluating how well it matches our observations . for gaussian statistics ,",
    "we would have that the probability for making an observation @xmath106 at a location @xmath107 where our model predicts a mean velocity @xmath108 and gaussian dispersion @xmath109 is @xmath110   \\ ; \\delta v \\,.\\ ] ] the choice of @xmath111 is arbitrary but represents how closely the model adheres to observation .",

    "our situation is not quite so simple , because we believe we have errors which are normally distributed in _",
    "log _ distance , and although our model distribution function has a gaussian distribution of velocity at any point , the mean velocity and velocity dispersion vary as a function of position , and hence are not a constant over the range where a given galaxy might lie",
    ". we deal with this for a galaxy of observed modulus @xmath115 by forming a distance probability distribution that consists of 11 points between @xmath116 to @xmath117 weighted according to gaussian statistics .",
    "the model is evaluated at each of these 11 points , providing a gaussian velocity distribution with some mean and dispersion at each point .",
    "we sum these 11 gaussians in velocity , weighted by their distance probabilities , to form a net probability distribution for the velocity we expect to see for this galaxy .",
    "our likelihood function is then simply formed by evaluating this probability at the observed velocity and summing a negative , normalized likelihood @xmath118,\\ ] ] where the constant term is introduced for @xmath111 in order to shift the zero point of @xmath119 into approximate agreement with @xmath49 .",
    "deviations of @xmath119 about its minimum , @xmath120 are described approximately by a @xmath49 distribution , so we use @xmath119 to evaluate goodness of fit and confidence intervals on parameters .",
    "we also calculate a variance for the velocity distribution function we derive for each galaxy and use them to form a traditional @xmath49 .",
    "this @xmath49 is useful for evaluating a goodness of fit , but does _ not _ correspond to maximum likelihood and is not minimized for the best fitting model .",
    "the model described in the previous section carries a lot of parameters , and there can be significant covariance between them , for example @xmath90 and @xmath96 , or @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we will first present a sequence of models which motivate our choices of mass components , starting with a hubble flow , and ending with two attractors contributing peculiar velocities .",
    "we will subsequently look more carefully at these covariances and try to show what is well constrained by our data and what is not .",
    "for example , we can not independently choose a unique @xmath90 and @xmath96 , but all our models give nearly the same run of peculiar velocity between 6 and 20 mpc from the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "distances will often be given in terms of their sgx , sgy , and sgz components in the supergalactic coordinate system , defined in the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs  1991 ) .",
    "it is extremely important not to force the models to conform to any particular velocity reference frame .",
    "for example , insisting on the cmb frame and using an @xmath71 density model for the great attractor leads to a very large infall velocity because of its covariance with @xmath121 .",
    "we use the cmb frame for velocity data , but we always fit for an arbitrary dipole vector @xmath66 as part of our models .",
    "figure [ fig : hubble ] shows all of the galaxies for which we have sbf distances plotted in a hubble diagram  redshift in the cmb frame as a function of distance .",
    "the expansion of the universe is apparent , and a naive linear fit , without regard for error bars or the fact that the abscissa carries greater errors , yields a hubble ratio of 73  .",
    "figure [ fig : h0 ] focusses in on the more distant galaxies with smaller errors and plots hubble ratio as a function of distance .",
    "local peculiar velocities cause scatter in the hubble ratio at distances of 40 , but it seems to settle down fairly well to an asymptotic value of 73 .",
    "however , as is seen in figure [ fig : hubble ] , there is a lot of scatter in the hubble plot , more than can be explained by distance error .",
    "the near field hubble flow is shown in figure [ fig : aniso ] in two different directions .",
    "velocities in the local group frame are used to avoid the constant velocity offset incurred by using the cmb frame locally .",
    "it is possible to discern the important features of the local large - scale flow .",
    "the virgo cluster in the lower pane at @xmath123mpc lies several hundred  below the hubble flow  this is often referred to as our `` infall velocity '' towards virgo .",
    "however , this is not the entire story , since the fornax cluster at @xmath124  _ also _ has a smaller velocity than the hubble flow , but the quadrupole from a pure virgo infall should cause it to have a larger velocity ( although it is quite near the quadrupole null at 45@xmath125 ) . likewise , the quadrupole from a pure flow towards virgo should cause the hubble ratio to be smaller in a direction perpendicular to virgo , but in fact we find a ratio in the upper panel which is slightly _ larger _ than the nominal hubble flow .",
    "what we are seeing in these local galaxies are the effects of two flows , one towards virgo and the other towards centaurus in the @xmath126sgx direction .",
    "we start by fitting the distances and velocities using a model which includes @xmath1 and a peculiar velocity @xmath66 , for a total of 4 free parameters .",
    "the sample consists of 285 galaxies . allowing 187  of thermal velocity but no additional virial velocities , we find @xmath127  and an overall dipole peculiar velocity of @xmath128  in the cmb frame .",
    "the @xmath119 for this model is 513 , and @xmath49 per degree of freedom ( dof ) for this model is @xmath129 .",
    "an obvious shortcoming of this model is that there is no allowance for virial velocities other than 187  of background thermal velocity .",
    "if we add in additional thermal components for fornax and centaurus ( 235 and 500 , which will be used throughout ) and virgo ( 650 , which is about what we find when we fit for it ) , @xmath119 drops considerably to @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in the cmb frame",
    "we again get @xmath132 with a negligibly different peculiar velocity of @xmath133 .",
    "figure [ fig : h0fit ] illustrates residuals of velocities after removal of this model in the cmb frame . in all these vector field plots , the black points ( falling stones ) are blueshifted residuals which are greater than 1-@xmath51 , the white points ( rising balloons ) are redshifted residuals greater than 1-@xmath51 , and the gray points are residuals which are less than 1-@xmath51 in absolute value .",
    "the arrows indicate the magnitude of the residual according to the hubble flow , i.e. an arrow of length 5  represents a velocity residual of @xmath134 .",
    "all the points are projected onto the supergalactic @xmath135 plane , and the region where the galactic plane cuts through is darker gray . when galaxies are members of a group we plot only the group residual , so as to prevent the plot from becoming too overcrowded .",
    "the main failing of this model is obvious .",
    "the residuals near @xmath136 are the virgo `` s - wave '' , positive peculiar velocities on the near side and negative on the far side of virgo .",
    "another way of looking at the quality of the fit is to plot observed peculiar velocity as a function of model peculiar velocity . in order not to be overwhelmed by galaxies which have a large virial velocity ( which does not appear in the mean model velocity ) ,",
    "we plot only those galaxies where the model velocity uncertainty is less than 250 .",
    "there appears to be a correlation in figure [ fig : h0resi ] between model and observed , but the agreement is not good .",
    "adding an extended `` virgo attractor '' ( va ) with @xmath137 near the location of the virgo cluster at @xmath138 , we find an infall velocity at the local group of @xmath139 , a virgo thermal velocity dispersion of @xmath140 , and a cutoff radius @xmath141 .",
    "the hubble constant rises slightly to @xmath142 , and @xmath143 in the cmb frame .",
    "this position for the va is the best fit location of a somewhat more elaborate model which also includes a great attractor . by itself",
    "the virgo attractor settles to a location of @xmath144 .",
    "the likelihood is @xmath145 , which is a significant improvement for just three additional parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : virgofit ] shows the residuals from this model .",
    "the `` s - wave '' of figures [ fig : hubble ] and [ fig : h0fit ] has been removed ; the black and white points are evenly distributed around the center of the model attractor at @xmath136 .",
    "however , a quadrupole signature remains evident , by which residuals in the @xmath146sgy direction tend to be blueshifted and residuals in the @xmath146sgx direction tend to be redshifted .",
    "figure [ fig : virgoresi ] shows the galaxy by galaxy residuals from this model . while they are somewhat better than figure [ fig : h0resi ] , the residual quadrupole causes substantial scatter .",
    "the @xmath147 value for this fit demonstrates that the model is a better match of the velocity field than a pure hubble flow , but the evident quadrupole and the peculiar velocity in the cmb frame which misses pointing at the centaurus cluster by only 10 degrees , indicates a new flow in that direction .",
    "following lilje et al .",
    "( 1986 ) we can add a quadrupole component to this fit , centered on the origin and with no cutoff .",
    "we find that @xmath119 improves substantially to 320.4 , and the rest of the parameters change slightly to @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "the quadrupole has a stretch of @xmath153  in roughly the + x/@xmath126z direction , a stretch of @xmath154  in the + x/+z direction , and a compression of @xmath155  in the @xmath146sgy direction .",
    "the above suggests that it might be profitable to try a fit with a second attractor .",
    "this is our `` great attractor '' ( ga ) component , and we will allow it to vary in both amplitude and position .",
    "we fit @xmath66+va+ga in the cmb frame and find @xmath156 , va parameters of @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , ga parameters of @xmath160 and @xmath161 , centered on @xmath162  mpc , and @xmath163 .",
    "the likelihood has improved to @xmath164 for 273 dof .",
    "figure [ fig : gafit ] shows the residuals when this model is removed from the observed velocities , and figure [ fig : garesi ] shows the residual comparison . like the previous one , this model uses power law exponents of @xmath165 and core radii @xmath166 .",
    "this two attractor plus dipole model appears to be a good description of the observed velocity field .",
    "it constitutes a significant improvement over a simple virgo infall model .",
    "if we force the overall dipole to zero in the cmb frame ( @xmath167 ) , we find that the cutoff radii want to go to infinity , and that @xmath119 rises to 305.3 for 278 dof .",
    "the other parameters change quite a bit : @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , centered on @xmath174  mpc .",
    "this illustrates how sensitive some of the parameters ( such as ga infall velocity ) are to an assumed velocity reference frame .",
    "finally , we return to the notion that influences from outside the volume where we have data will manifest themselves to lowest order as a dipole velocity and a quadrupole , and that our spherical flow fields are overly simplistic .",
    "we see a persistent @xmath175 velocity and figure [ fig : gafit ] still seems to have a dipole pattern .",
    "we now fit a model which includes a velocity dipole , the virgo and great attractors with free amplitudes and @xmath96 , and a 5 component quadrupole which is centered on the origin and has a cutoff radius of @xmath176 .",
    "we use a power law exponent of @xmath177 for the va and @xmath178 for the ga , as suggested by the confidence contours illustrated below , and @xmath179 .",
    "the positions of the va and ga are fixed at @xmath138 and @xmath180 respectively ( their best - fit locations ) .",
    "we find that @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .",
    "the likelihood has improved to @xmath187 for 272 dof .",
    "figure [ fig : qfit ] shows the residuals when this model is removed from the observed velocities , and figure [ fig : qresi ] shows the residual comparison .",
    "the quadrupole found by this model has an expansion of @xmath188 in the @xmath189 direction , a compression of @xmath190 in the @xmath191 direction , and a small compression of @xmath192  in the @xmath193 direction .",
    "it and the peculiar dipole @xmath194  are significant at more than 3-sigma .",
    "the reason that introducing a traceless quadrupole changes the model @xmath1 is that the sample galaxies are not isotropically distributed . in particular ,",
    "the major compression axis of the quadrupole is in the direction of virgo , which is obviously rich in galaxies .",
    "thus , without the quadrupole component , the model is forced to compensate for this extra compression by lowering its value for @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible that the quadrupole arises locally because discrete , spherical attractors are being used to model flows in what is actually an anisotropic potential .",
    "we discuss this idea further in ",
    "[ ssec : cmbframe ] .",
    "alternatively the dipole and quadrupole could come from unmodelled attractors outside our volume .",
    "we investigate below whether some of the well - known galaxy superclusters such as perseus , coma , and shapley could be the origin , but we will defer a more complete investigation for a subsequent paper .",
    "if we allow the cosmic thermal velocity dispersion to vary from the fixed value of 187  that we have been assuming , then it now settles in at @xmath195  for our @xmath66+va+ga+q model .",
    "the model likelihood does not change in any significant way , of course .",
    "this result is completely insensitive to the motions of galaxies within the virgo cluster , as these are handled by the fitted cluster virial dispersion .",
    "actually , this best - fit `` thermal '' dispersion also includes a component from the velocity measurement errors , but these are relatively small and correcting for them puts @xmath196 around 180 .",
    "our fitted value for the virgo velocity dispersion of @xmath197  is identical to those found in kinematical studies .",
    "the agreement is expected , since the velocity data are largely the same .",
    "for instance , girardi  ( 1996 ) concluded @xmath198  for galaxies within 2of the virgo core .",
    "if we delete the 12 galaxies within 2  mpc of the center of the virgo cluster , the fit parameters for the ( @xmath199 ) model become @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "this is virtually identical to the model that includes the virgo core , and demonstrates that our models are able to accept large virial velocities and still reliably follow large - scale flows .",
    "we have deliberately tried to provide a great deal of flexibility in the modelling ( for example by always fitting for a velocity reference frame ) . however , there are so many parameters making up this model that it can be deceptive to quote a formal error on a parameter without disclosing the covariances it has with other parameters .",
    "the greatest covariances come from the @xmath96 parameters , interacting with @xmath90 and infall amplitude especially .",
    "the next most troublesome covariances come from the sgx component of the reference frame velocity vector @xmath66 mixing with the ga infall amplitude and @xmath1 , and there is also a little bit of direct covariance between @xmath1 and @xmath122 . apart from these ,",
    "the formal covariances between parameters are less than 0.6 in magnitude .",
    "the contour diagrams of this section illustrate these covariances as well as graphically showing the uncertainties in other interesting parameters .",
    "the shaded regions of these plots enclose the 68 , 90 , and 95 percent confidence regions for two variables , and the bars on the axes show the @xmath204 limits for each variable considered separately .",
    "figure  [ fig : locvir ] shows the joint confidence contours on the distance , infall velocities , and location on the sky of the virgo attractor , and figure [ fig : locga ] shows the same thing for the great attractor .",
    "the locations of these attractors are evidently quite well constrained purely by the velocity data .",
    "the best - fit distance for the virgo attractor of 17.1  is coincident with both the location of ngc  4486 and the median of the galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster to within the errors .",
    "the location of the ga is similar in distance to the most distant galaxies attributed to the cen-30 cluster but lies about 15 degrees from cen-30 . as figure [ fig : locga ] illustrates , this is a complicated region .",
    "figure [ fig : wcov ] shows how the sgx component @xmath121 of the dipole velocity affects both the ga infall amplitude and the hubble constant .",
    "the cosmic thermal velocity is little affected by any other parameter , and is quite well constrained at 187 .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath1 has a formal covariance of 0.6 with the ga infall amplitude , but such a small covariance scarcely affects the determination of each independently .",
    "figures [ fig : rcutvir ] and [ fig : rcutga ] show the confidence contours for the @xmath96 parameter on the power law exponents and the infall velocities of the virgo and great attractors .",
    "evidently these parameters are very poorly constrained individually , and values of @xmath205 for va and @xmath206 for ga can be offset by appropriate changes in @xmath96 to yield acceptable models .",
    "nevertheless , overall run of peculiar velocity with position varies little among these models .",
    "figure [ fig : flows ] shows the run of net model velocity as a function of position along vectors towards the virgo and great attractors .",
    "the four curves are @xmath207 , and @xmath208 ( va ) and @xmath209 , and @xmath210 ( ga ) for which @xmath211 is virtually constant around 269 .",
    "( the enclosed density profile of the virgo attractor can be described quite accurately as an exponential with scale length 5  mpc . ) except in the cores of the attractors , the curves differ very little .",
    "we also plot the galaxies which lie within @xmath212 of the vectors ( @xmath213 ) to give a sense of the number of constraining points we have near the attractors ( although the attractor models are affected by galaxies all over the sky ) .",
    "the agreement between the galaxy and model velocities in this plot should only be very approximate close to the attractors because the angle between the line of sight and the vector from the galaxy to the attractor becomes much greater than @xmath212 .",
    "figure [ fig : infalls ] illustrates this slightly differently .",
    "these panels show how @xmath214 for each of the two attractors individually varies as a function of distance from the attractor , given these four models with very different @xmath90 s .",
    "the models diverge close to and far from the attractors but there is a broad range where the models give substantially the same values for infall velocity ( @xmath215  mpc for the va and @xmath216  mpc for the ga ) .",
    "we draw power - law approximations for these two attractors on the plots whose slopes are @xmath217 , although it is apparent that all models for both attractors curve away from a pure power law over these radial ranges . the ratio of attractor infall velocity to hubble flow is for the virgo attractor @xmath218 and for the great attractor @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the distances of the local group from the attractors .    not surprisingly , for a given value of @xmath9 we find quite consistent values for @xmath75 , the overdensity within our radius , for these models . for the virgo attractor , values of @xmath222 lead to values of @xmath223 , or",
    "@xmath224  m. however , if the quadrupole is caused by a non - spherical virgo ( as we suggest below ) , these estimates for @xmath75 and @xmath225 are not meaningful , although equation  ( [ eq : vflow ] ) is . for the great attractor , models with @xmath206 lead to values of @xmath226 , or @xmath227",
    "m. ( these masses , of course , are the masses in excess of background density within spheres centered on the attractors with radius reaching the local group . ) from this it is easy to solve for the radius and angle subtended by the zero velocity surface ( sphere where infall cancels outward hubble flow ) around these attractors .",
    "for the virgo attractor this is 6 , or @xmath228 ; for the ga it is 14 , or again about @xmath229 .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : infalls ] that by @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) the models do not fit well unless they are falling at least as steeply as @xmath232 .",
    "in particular , pure isothermal models ( @xmath233 , unmitigated by any cutoff ) would provide poor representations of the mass distributions .",
    "the ga distance is well constrained in these models at @xmath234 .",
    "this is a bit behind most of the galaxies comprising the cen-30 and cen-45 clusters .",
    "in fact , the cen-30 `` cluster '' appears to be galaxies distributed over 5 - 10  on the near side of the ga and the `` s - wave '' distortion of the hubble flow causes them to share similar redshifts .",
    "this is illustrated in figures [ fig : vcont ] and [ fig : vcontgxy ] , which show contours of our flow model with and without survey galaxies overlaid .",
    "we do not have a good constraint on the ga amplitude closer than 10 , so the very dramatic peculiar velocities inside that radius may well be overestimates . in this projection ,",
    "the centaurus galaxies fall above the ga , but they lie in the stall region near @xmath235 angular separation , and the model and data agree on a typical cmb velocity of 3150 .",
    "similarly , the ursa major group lies in the stall region near the va with a cmb velocity of 1150 , and the virgo southern extension lies in a stall zone with cmb velocity of 1500 .",
    "the general trend of the model for @xmath35 to range from 1100  to 1500  as sgl swings from @xmath236 to @xmath237 is apparent in redshifts surveys of the region , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : gauma ] .",
    "we note that the ga distance increases by about 10% when the 3 high velocity cen-45 galaxies",
    "( with good quality data ) are included in the modeling .",
    "however , the likelihood of the model suffers badly in trying to accomodate just these 3 additional dof , rising from @xmath238 to @xmath239 .",
    "thus , for now we have chosen to exclude them .",
    "a detailed discussion of the distribution and motions of galaxies in the ga / centaurus region , and a comparison of the sbf flow model results with those of previous ga models will be given by dressler  ( 1999 ) .",
    "we now ask if the perseus - pisces supercluster and/or the shapley concentration could be sources of the peculiar dipole @xmath66 and quadrupole that we find .",
    "to test this idea , we add to our standard @xmath66+va+ga+q model compact attractors representing perseus - pisces at @xmath240 and shapley at @xmath241 , allowing the masses to be free parameters .",
    "the likelihood @xmath211 improves to 267.2 , which is not a significant improvement for two new parameters over the previous value of 269.2 . for perseus - pisces",
    ", we find an insignificant velocity amplitude of @xmath242 ; recall that this is normalized at the fiducial radius of 50 mpc .",
    "for shapley , we find an extraordinary @xmath243 , which for the assigned distance of 210 mpc corresponds to a velocity of 1013  at the local group .",
    "the other parameters change a great deal to offset this , especially @xmath66 which adjusts itself to @xmath244 .",
    "equally telling however , is the fact that the quadrupole _ grows _ to have eigenvectors of @xmath245 , @xmath124 , and @xmath246 , indicating that the inclusion of perseus and shapley has made this model less plausible .",
    "there is a great deal of covariance between the distant shapley attractor and the @xmath66 term , so we ran another model including the shapley attractor but with @xmath66 set to zero .",
    "this model gave a velocity amplitude @xmath247 , corresponding at the local group to @xmath248 .",
    "the likelihood of this model is @xmath249 , which for only one additional parameter is a substantial improvement over the @xmath250 of 278.5 found for a model with va+ga+q but no @xmath66 or shapley component .",
    "however , the fit is worse than our standard model with @xmath66 and no distant attractors , although the difference in the fitted quadrupole components for these two models is now insignificant .",
    "( adding a perseus attractor gives no further improvement ; it is in the wrong direction to compensate for the lost flexibility of @xmath66 . )",
    "we conclude that perseus - pisces exerts no significant influence on our local volume , consistent with previous studies in this direction ( e.g. , willick 1990 ; courteau  1993 ; hudson  1997 ) , and that the shapley concentration is not the source of the peculiar quadrupole in our modeling , although it might contribute some part of the observed dipole . bearing this last point in mind",
    ", we continue with our standard model because it provides a better fit to the data than the model which replaces @xmath66 with a shapley attractor .",
    "in addition , we show below in  [ ssec : cmbframe ] that the dipole can be removed by simply translating the quadrupole origin to the center of virgo .",
    "similarly we experimented with including nearby abell clusters , selected under the assumption that their galaxy counts are proportional to their masses and ranking them by @xmath251 . using a suite of the 22 most significant ones ( including coma , perseus , a2199 , etc . ) and allowing their mass - to - luminosity ratio to be a free parameter gives a likelihood @xmath211 = 268.8 , not a significant improvement .",
    "the model parameters are virtually unchanged , including the quadrupole and the dipole velocity .      lacking any a priori information about the values of the @xmath75 s ,",
    "we have very little constraint on @xmath9 .",
    "only the non - linear component to yahil s @xmath72 law ( eq .  [ eq : upec ] ) provides any leverage at all .",
    "nevertheless , if we permit @xmath9 to be a free parameter the best fitting model comes in with @xmath211 = 269.2 , and @xmath252 .",
    "if we refit our standard model with @xmath253 , we find @xmath211 = 269.5 , again indicating how little direct handle we have on @xmath9 .",
    "the other parameters change very little , but as expected , the combination of @xmath254 for the two attractors is relatively constant for the various values of @xmath9 at 0.33 for the virgo attractor and 0.27 for the great attractor",
    ". we plan in a future work to compare our measured peculiar velocities to the galaxy distribution and so obtain constraints on @xmath9 .",
    "we find good fits to the velocity field using attractors whose density distributions go as @xmath255 when @xmath74 is small enough that @xmath256 , but steepening to @xmath257 by @xmath258 .",
    "most previous parametric flow models have adopted isothermal @xmath165 attractors ( e.g. , lynden - bell  1988 ; han & mould 1990 ) , as @xmath90 was not well - constrained by their data sets .",
    "aaronson  ( 1989 ) did allow @xmath90 to vary in their model , although they constrained it to be the same for both the virgo and great attractor mass concentrations , and found @xmath259 .",
    "faber & burstein ( 1988 ) also experimented with different @xmath90 s and found that virgo was roughly isothermal , and the more distant ga preferred @xmath260 .",
    "this is similar to what we find with @xmath96 set to infinity and @xmath90 allowed to vary , but we prefer the approach adopted in the previous section because of the substantial improvement of the fit .",
    "the isothermal cluster assumption was motivated by dynamical evidence that the enclosed mass in clusters increased approximately linearly ( e.g. , press & davis 1982 ) .",
    "observations continue to show flat velocity dispersion profiles for many clusters , in support of this assumption ( e.g. , fadda  1996 ) .",
    "weak lensing observations are also consistent with isothermal , or somewhat steeper , mass distributions ( squires  1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "however , none of these studies probe beyond a few mpc from the cluster centers , whereas we are dealing here with the distributions over tens of mpc .",
    "numerical studies by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 , 1997 ) suggest that cluster dark matter halos in hierarchical collapse models should go as @xmath232 at large radii .",
    "earlier numerical work on the collapse of isolated halos produced even steeper @xmath261 profiles at large radii ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) .",
    "the total mass of course depends strongly on @xmath90 , with the @xmath262 yielding an infinite mass ; thus at some point the distribution must steepen .",
    "our observed mass profiles therefore are quite reasonable in terms of flat velocity dispersion profiles and the numerical simulations .",
    "although we find a 4-@xmath51 , 150  dipole residual pointing in the sgy direction , we regard this result as an indication that our survey volume , which extends to about 3000  or 40 , is essentially at rest with respect to the cmb . indeed",
    ", we can clearly create or remove any dipole velocity we like by shifting the origin of the quadrupole contribution , as is evident from equation  ( [ eq : matrix ] ) , provided the quadrupole matrix is invertible . applying the inverse of the quadrupole to the dipole velocity @xmath66 of our best fit model implies a quadrupole origin of @xmath263 , rather close to the va ,",
    "although moved somewhat towards the ga . if we shift the quadrupole origin from the local group to the center of the virgo attractor ( which can then partially mimic the effects of a flattened attractor ) , choose a cutoff @xmath264  mpc , and fit with @xmath167 , we find @xmath211 = 272.0 , which is only 3 greater with effectively three fewer degrees of freedom ; it is 6.5 less ( with the same dof ) than the model with @xmath167 and the quadrupole centered on the lg .",
    "alternatively we can fit for @xmath66 with the quadrupole centered on the virgo attractor , and we find @xmath265 or within 1-@xmath51 of zero in each coordinate .",
    "we therefore think it likely that the galaxies in our survey volume are on average at rest with respect to the cmb , and that the dipole and quadrupole terms of our standard model are acting as lowest order correction terms to our spherical virgo attractor .",
    "we found previously that addition of a quadrupole component to the two attractor model caused the hubble constant to increase from 73 to 78 as the likelihood improved .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ fig : hqsig ] which shows confidence contours of our standard model as a function of @xmath1 and quadrupole amplitude relative to the best fit value .",
    "we find that moving the origin of the quadrupole to virgo also has a slight side effect on the value of the hubble constant .",
    "if there were no cutoff in the quadrupole its origin would be completely degenerate with @xmath66 , but when when the quadrupole is centered on virgo we find that @xmath1 drops slightly to 76 , and there is some covariance between @xmath1 and @xmath88 in the sense that larger @xmath88 leads to larger @xmath1 , as seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hqsig ] . because this use of a quadrupole correction to a spherical infall model seems like a poor approximation to a flattened potential , and because the eigenvectors of the quadrupole are tipped by @xmath266 from the sgz symmetry axis of the galaxy distribution , we do not prefer this model over the one which has the quadrupole centered on the local group .",
    "nevertheless , we are mindful of the sensitivity of @xmath1 to this possibility and we therefore choose @xmath267 as the most likely range we can derive from these data and models .    unlike lynden - bell  ( 1988 )",
    ", we do not find that centaurus has a much larger radial peculiar velocity in the cmb frame than the local group .",
    "instead it appears to have a significant extent falling into the attractor at 43  and at least some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4767 ) have no radial velocity with respect to the cmb .",
    "dressler et al . will discuss this issue in greater depth , but it appears that the flow in the great attractor region is fairly complex and may need many more high accuracy distances before it can be completely untangled .      the local group is moving at @xmath268 , with components @xmath269 , with respect to the cmb frame , but we have not used this fact at all in our modelling .",
    "to what extent can we account for this motion of the local group reference frame in the context of our model ?",
    "the three contributors to the model velocity at the local group are as follows :    we can account for @xmath121 and @xmath175 quite well ; the residual of @xmath270  is not statistically significant and is in any case a reasonable peculiar velocity for the local group with respect to the nearby hubble flow .",
    "the @xmath271 residual of @xmath272  is much too large to be an unsuspected motion of the milky way with respect to the lg frame .",
    "the models by yahil et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and courteau & van den bergh ( 1999 ) , among others , require that this be a motion of the entire local group .",
    "our sample does not have any nearby galaxies which are far enough out of the supergalactic plane to ascertain whether this motion is restricted to the local group or extends farther .",
    "the nearest galaxy in our sample with @xmath273 is 8  mpc distant , and at sgb@xmath274 we could not distinguish between @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "we note that this velocity is similar in magnitude to our best - fit 1-d thermal velocity .",
    "this peculiar motion of the local group in the general direction of @xmath126sgz has been noted before and was named the `` local anomaly '' ( la ) by tully ( 1988 ) and faber & burstein ( 1988 ) , who both attributed it to inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution within @xmath277 , including the `` local void '' ( tully & fisher 1987 ) .",
    "these authors found fairly large la velocities : the faber & burstein value was 360  towards @xmath278 , or @xmath279  in supergalactic components .",
    "han & mould ( 1990 ) modeled the la in more detail and found a smaller net motion of 236towards @xmath280 , or @xmath281 .",
    "all three of these sets of authors used the aaronson  ( 1982b ) infrared tully - fisher data set to measure the la .",
    "aaronson  ( 1982a ) themselves found a lg peculiar motion of @xmath282  and attributed the large @xmath126sgz velocity to a displacement of the local group above the supergalactic plane and a resultant downward acceleration .",
    "lahav  ( 1993 ) suggested that the la could be explained by the combined effects of the local void in the @xmath283sgz direction and the puppis concentration of galaxies towards @xmath126sgz , with possible smaller contributions from fornax and eridanus .",
    "the puppis concentration was revealed by hi surveys of _ iras_-selected galaxies ; it is a rich , but loose , association of galaxies lying in the galactic plane at @xmath284 with a mean velocity of about 2000(yamada  1994 ) .",
    "lu & freudling ( 1995 ) surveyed the region behind the galactic plane towards the direction of the faber & burstein ( 1988 ) and han & mould ( 1990 ) la vectors and disputed the conclusion of lahav et  al .",
    "since they found no other significant excesses of nearby galaxies , lu & freudling concluded that any motion arising from a gravitional pull of nearby galaxies and a push from the local void , whose center is nearly diametrically opposite puppis , would have to be directed almost straight towards puppis , nearly 45@xmath125 from the supposed direction of the la vector .",
    "in fact , the local anomaly we find here has an apex at @xmath285 , remarkably close to the direction of the puppis concentration and to the anticenter of the local void as sketched out by lu & freudling .",
    "however , the magnitude we find is significantly smaller than the faber & burstein value adopted by lahav  ( 1993 ) ; thus , the @xmath3350  contribution they estimated for the puppis galaxies becomes less necessary .",
    "likewise , han & mould ( 1990 ) concluded that the local void might account for their fairly modest la motion , if the mean position of the void was a free parameter .",
    "we experimented with adding a gaussian void , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vamp ] ) , to our standard model along the positive sgz axis . we first looked at a very small local void with both the distance and gaussian size set to 10  mpc and fitted for the velocity amplitude . since there is some covariance between @xmath286 and @xmath271 , we set @xmath287 .",
    "we find a best - fit amplitude of @xmath288 , and an improvement in @xmath119 from 269.2 to 267.7 , marginally significant .",
    "this void provides a push of @xmath289  at the location of the lg .",
    "the model parameters show little change , although @xmath1 drops from 78 to 77 .",
    "alternatively , we tried adding a local void using the distance and size of 20  suggested by redshift surveys and fixing the amplitude at the value of @xmath290  which provides the push of @xmath272  at the local group that we are trying to understand .",
    "the central @xmath75 of this void is close to @xmath291 .",
    "this time we do allow @xmath271 vary . the fit improves still more to @xmath292 and @xmath271 is still negligible at @xmath293 , but the amplitudes of the va and ga shift quite a bit to 172 and 159respectively , @xmath121 and @xmath175 also move to @xmath294 and @xmath295 , and @xmath1 decreases to 73 .",
    "obviously fine - tuning the free parameters could produce an even better match to the excess lg motion , but this is precisely the sort of ad  hoc modelling which we think is not appropriate .",
    "this void s properties are not well - constrained in our model nor are there well - motivated external constraints , so we choose not to make this adjustment to our standard model , but simply note that our peculiar velocity data do seem to support the idea that there is a 20  void above the local group which is nearly empty at its center .",
    "another interesting issue is the peculiar velocity of the local group with respect to the virgo attractor , since this was the historical means of determining the virgo infall amplitude .",
    "the local group is approaching virgo at about 139  due to the virgo attractor itself ; the great attractor causes the lg and virgo to converge at 97 ; the extra quadrupole component results in the lg and virgo approaching each other at an additional 173 .",
    "the total model peculiar velocity between the local group and virgo is therefore 409 .",
    "it is unclear how much `` infall velocity '' to ascribe to the virgo attractor . using our model of the virgo attractor as a spherical distribution",
    ", it only tugs on us at 139 .",
    "however , if we regard the entire quadrupole as a component of an anisotropic virgo attractor , the net tug on the lg is 303 .",
    "these considerations may partially account for the widely disparate values which have been reported for the virgo infall amplitude . depending on the sample",
    "one is using and whether one s fit is dominated by model amplitudes near our location or averaged all around the virgo supercluster , it is possible to get naive `` infall velocities '' ( i.e. , peculiar velocity between virgo and the lg ) anywhere between 140  and 400 .",
    "our analysis finds more modest infall velocities at the local group and a smaller bulk flow than most previous studies .",
    "part of the reason for our smaller infall velocities is that our modeling has been more flexible in not requiring a single power - law profile for the massive attractors .",
    "thus , our model can accommodate fairly large infalls close to the attractors without requiring large motions at the local group .",
    "in addition , we have not required the spherical infalls to account for all of the local group motion in the cmb frame , but rather have allowed the reference frame to be a free parameter .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath167 , @xmath296 , and omitting the quadrupole term yields a model similar to that of lynden - bell  ( 1988 ) , but at a significant cost in the likelihood ( see  [ ssec : infalls ] ) .    our best - fit bulk flow @xmath66 of @xmath33150  towards @xmath297 , and the strong indications that even this modest value may be an artifact of the model , appears inconsistent with several recent studies which find large - scale streaming motions of amplitude @xmath33700   for volumes encompassing our survey volume ( e.g. , lauer & postman 1994 ; hudson  1999 ; willick 1999 ) . however , it is quite consistent with the bulk flows found by the @xmath25-band tully - fisher study of giovanelli  ( 1998 ) ( using their `` case b '' weighting ) .",
    "these authors report bulk flows of @xmath298  towards @xmath299 for their full sample of 24 clusters extending out to 9000  kms@xmath300 , and @xmath301  towards @xmath302 for their 17 clusters within 6000  kms@xmath300 .",
    "our best - fit 1-d thermal velocity is @xmath303  km / s , after making allowance for velocity measurement uncertainty .",
    "lynden - bell  ( 1988 ) found a best - fit thermal dispersion of @xmath304 in their favored model and concluded that this result was mainly due to small - scale flows , not virial dispersions in groups .",
    "strauss , cen , & ostriker ( 1993 ) calculated the thermal velocity dispersions from several peculiar motions surveys in order to compare the resulting mach numbers ( the ratio of the mean bulk flow to the 3-d thermal dispersion ) to expectations from various cosmologies .",
    "their estimates of the 1-d dispersions from the observational surveys ranged from 250 to 420 .",
    "more recent large - scale flow studies often simply assume a value @xmath305  for clusters and find that the resulting @xmath306 ( e.g. , willick 1999 ; hudson  1999 ) . the giovanelli  ( 1998 ) cluster study allowed this to be a free parameter and found @xmath307 .",
    "however , on small enough scales there is evidence that the dispersion of galaxies ( field spirals in particular ) about their local flow field is closer to @xmath33125(davis , miller , & white 1997 ; willick  1997 ) .",
    "this value may better reflect the virial velocities of galaxies within small groups .      the revised  calibration of eq .  ( [ eq : newcal ] )",
    "carries a formal zero - point uncertainty of 0.10  mag from the sbf / cepheid galaxy comparison .",
    "this uncertainty is larger than the 0.07  mag quoted in sbf - i because that paper used the group comparison , which averaged many sbf distances for each cepheid distance .",
    "as stated above , the group comparison is 0.130.19 mag fainter than the galaxy comparison . by choosing the galaxy calibration over the group one",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that the difference is due to a systematic offset in the mean distances of the hst key project cepheid galaxies and the groups in which they are thought to reside .",
    "the alternative explanation is that the measured sbf magnitudes are systematically too bright for the spiral bulges , either because of population effects or because of extra variance from dust or other features .",
    "ferrarese  ( 1999 ) have likewise chosen the former explanation and have derived a calibration similar to that given here .    with this new calibration and depending on the flow model , we have derived values of @xmath1 in the range of 7080 .",
    "this range correlates with the amount of mass in the model attractors .",
    "the value of @xmath127 corresponds to a pure hubble flow plus overall dipole model ; at the other extreme with @xmath308 is a dual isothermal ( @xmath309 ) attractor model with @xmath96 set to infinity .",
    "the former model is ruled out by the extremely poor @xmath310 ; the latter model overestimates the attractor masses , thus overestimating @xmath1 .",
    "when we allow @xmath96 to vary and produce an @xmath232 ( and steeper ) large radius falloff to the models , @xmath1 comes out near 74 .",
    "there is , however , a significant degree of anisotropy in the data with respect to this model as evidenced by the dramatic improvement in likelihood when a quadrupole component is introduced into the model . as it happens , relieving this anisotropy with a quadrupole centered on the local group causes our value for @xmath1 to rise somewhat to @xmath311 , whereas a quadrupole centered on virgo yields an @xmath1 of 76 . despite our qualms about the ad hoc nature of the latter model , the fact that it has a @xmath66 consistent with zero causes us to prefer it slightly for estimating @xmath1 .",
    "thus , for our best estimate of a flow - corrected but unbiased value , we adopt @xmath312 the first errorbar is the quadrature sum of the internal uncertainty for a single flow model and an estimate of the likely range from the different models .",
    "the second errorbar includes the 0.10mag uncertainty in the fitted calibration to cepheids and an estimated 0.17mag uncertainty in the cepheid zero point itself ( see ferrarese ) ; these systematic uncertainties also have been combined in quadrature .    our value for @xmath1 differs from the value of 69  found by the ferrarese  ( 1999 ) analysis of sbf",
    "partially because of our choice of zero point and partially because of the flow models used .",
    "we have done extensive modeling to estimate and remove the effects of large - scale flows from our data .",
    "another difference is that we have used the full survey data set in deriving @xmath1 , rather than just four sbf measurements from .",
    "consequently , our best value is 11% larger than theirs , although marginally consistent within the random uncertainty .    as with the key project results ,",
    "if the cepheid calibration is changed so that the distance modulus of the large magellanic cloud is 0.2  mag smaller than the standard 18.5  mag value , then @xmath1 would increase by 10% ; if the kennicutt  ( 1998 ) metallicity dependence for the cepheid period - luminosity relation is correct , then @xmath1 would decrease by 5% .",
    "however , our calibration would become quite discordant with the theoretical calibration using worthey s models if the zero point moved by more than about 0.2mag , and those models are largely based on the rr lyrae and parallax distance scales , rather than cepheids .",
    "we have shown that the sbf technique is a powerful tool in mapping the local and large - scale velocity field through accurate distance measurements to early - type galaxies .",
    "judging by our best data , for which the product of seeing and distance @xmath313 , distance measurements with an accuracy of @xmath314% are attainable for any early - type galaxies with sufficiently good data .",
    "distance measurements of this accuracy are essentially immune to malmquist - like biases .",
    "the parametric model we have developed is unique in the way it handles both local peculiar motions and velocity dispersions , particularly for galaxy clusters .",
    "although it is important to follow this first analysis with non - parametric models , we find it remarkable that nearly all of the deviation from a smooth hubble flow can be accounted for by the addition of two spherical , truncated isothermal attractors , one centered on the virgo cluster and the other centered just beyond the most distant of the ellipticals associated with the cen-30 and cen-45 clusters .",
    "these two attractors appear to center on enhancements in galaxy distribution , consistent with the idea that galaxy light traces mass in at least some approximate way .",
    "the improvement in the model with the inclusion of an additional dipole and quadrupole is statistically significant , but our analysis indicates that these terms are more likely the result of inadequacies in the spherical attractor model , rather than manifestations of additional mass fluctuations beyond our survey volume .",
    "further measurements , particularly beyond the @xmath315  limit of most of our data , will be able to discriminate between competing explanations , but it is clear from the size and direction of these components that the influence of mass overdensities in the perseus - pisces supercluster or shapley concentration do not play a substantial role in perturbing the velocity field within @xmath316 .    not surprisingly , we find strong covariance between pairs of parameters , for example , the amplitude of the ga infall and the strength of the dipole component in this direction , or the cutoff radius and the power - law exponent of mass distribution attributed to the attractors .",
    "new data are unlikely to reduce some of these covariances , but additional measurements on the backside of the great attractor , for example , will be able to constrain much better the contribution from more distant concentrations that produce a local dipole .",
    "our standard flow model resolves most of the local group s motion with respect to the cmb , except for the continued presence of a nearly @xmath317 component perpendicular to the supergalactic plane .",
    "this `` local anomaly '' has been seen before in other data sets .",
    "the amplitude we find is generally smaller than in those previous studies , and crude modeling of this `` anomalous '' motion as a `` push '' from a nearby void in the @xmath283sgz direction can account for nearly all of it .",
    "our data are considerably more accurate than those used in the analysis of lynden - bell et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . our best fit model ,",
    "while qualitatively similar , is significantly different , but this is mainly a product of our inclusion of other components , for example , the inclusion of a dipole in addition to the two attractors . in particular , the thermal velocity of our sample is only @xmath318 , significantly lower than the lynden - bell et al .",
    ". a more detailed comparison of our study with previous results will appear in dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we find zero or at most a very small dipole motion in the @xmath319 volume , which is consistent with the study of giovanelli et al .",

    "the hubble constant that results from this calibration , @xmath321  is somewhat higher than results of that study , partially because we choose a different zero point and partially because we have a more extensive set of galaxies and a more sophisticated model .",

    "the next two are components centered on the va and ga at the positions listed above , with amplitudes 650and 500  respectively at the center , but falling off spatially as a gaussian with a sigma of 2 .",
    "finally , we incorporate a fourth component for the fornax cluster , centered at @xmath349 , with amplitude 235  and again a spatial falloff with sigma of 2 .",

    "we find it difficult to choose a zero point for sbf using the various cepheid distances which are available because we are faced with two options , each with virtues and faults .",
    "sbf is best measured in elliptical and s0 galaxies , and there are no direct cepheid distance to such galaxies .",
    "worse , there are presently no distances to spiral galaxies which appear to be tidally interacting with e or s0 galaxies ( such as ngc  4647 and ngc  4649 ) .",
    "we therefore are faced with the unpleasant choice of associating cepheid distances to sbf galaxies via group associations , or else measuring sbf directly in spiral bulges where cepheid distances exist .      for a group comparison",
    "we refer to ferrarese et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for cepheid distances , but we reject the coma groups because of the extreme confusion in that region , the cen  a group because it has a very large depth inferred from its angular extent across the sky , and the ngc  7331 group because it is really a galaxy - galaxy comparison with all the inherent worries described below .",
    "we also , for the sake of argument , do not agree with ferrarese et al . in the inclusion of ngc  1425 as part of fornax .",
    "it is statistically inconsistent with the other two cepheid galaxies , ngc  1326a and ngc  1365 ; it is halfway between the fornax and the eridanus clusters , and its cepheid distance is 0.40 mag more distant than the other two , very close to the 0.46 mag that we find for the mean distance between fornax and eridanus .",
    "we also concur with ferrarese et al . in rejecting ngc  4639 from the virgo cluster because it is 0.77 mag more distant .",
    "table [ tab : grp ] lists the mean  we find for these groups , adjusted to a fiducial color of @xmath17 , the distance modulus from ferrarese et al . , and the inferred sbf zero point , the absolute  at the fiducial color .",
    "these groups paint a very consistent story : the zero point of the sbf calibration is @xmath350 .",
    "the big advantage to using a group calibration is that we have many , very good sbf measurements in groups , as is reflected in the very small error bars .",
    "the biggest disadvantage is that the association of spirals with ellipticals is shaky at best . as pointed out by jacoby et al .",
    "( 1992 ) the spirals in groups seem to lie outside of an elliptical core , as one might expect from the fragility of spirals and the harsh environment in the center of a group .",
    "however , in this case we are finding a sheet of five cepheid bearing spirals at precisely the distance we assign to the core of the virgo cluster , and two spirals at precisely the same distance as the core of fornax .",
    "had we included ngc  1425 as part of fornax and ngc  4639 as part of virgo , we might have expected the elliptical core to lie somewhere in between , leading to a brighter zero point by 0.10.2 mag .",
    "we again refer to ferrarese et al . for cepheid distances to galaxies where we have measured an sbf magnitude in the bulge .",
    "table [ tab : gxy ] lists the mean  we find for these six galaxies , adjusted to a fiducial color of @xmath17 , the distance modulus from ferrarese et al . , and the inferred sbf zero point , the absolute at the fiducial color",
    ".    these galaxies also are self consistent : the zero point of the sbf calibration comes out as @xmath351 .",
    "given the wide range in the errors in the sbf measurement , it is also interesting to look at the median : @xmath352 .",
    "unfortunately the galaxy average is inconsistent with the group calibration ",
    "they differ by 2.2 sigma which makes us very reluctant simply to take the group - galaxy comparison average .",
    "the advantages of using the very same galaxies to carry out the calibration is that there is no doubt about the spatial relationship of the stars contributing to the sbf mean and the cepheids .",
    "the disadvantage is that the sbf measurement is very hard , as is evidenced by the large error bars .",
    "we can only work on the side of the bulge which is in front of the plane of the disk ; we must contend with dust in the bulge ; we are affected by a portion of the disk which underlays the bulge we are analyzing ; we encounter strong color gradients ; and we always worry that somehow sbf might be different in spiral bulges than in ellipticals ( despite the evidence to the contrary presented in sbf - i ) .",
    "we can try to improve our sbf measurements , but for some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4414 ) even hst resolution only reveals more and more dust threaded throughout the bulge .",
    "we do our best to make an accurate , unbiased measurement of sbf in spiral bulges , but we suspect that if there is a bias , it is probably in the sense of assigning too bright an sbf magnitude .    given the probability that the ellipticals and spirals in these groups may be systematically separated in space , we feel that we must use the galaxy - galaxy calibration , although we are hedging our choice slightly by using the galaxy median .",
    "this is a situation which must be improved by further observation .",

    "<S> we discuss how this difference arises from a different choice of zero point , a larger sample of galaxies , and a different model for large scale flows . </S>",
    "<S> the zero point of the sbf relation is the largest source of uncertainty , and the sbf value for @xmath1 is subject to all the systematic uncertainties of the kp zero point , including a 5% decrease if a metallicity correction is adopted .    to analyze local and large - scale flows </S>",
    "<S>  departures from smooth hubble flow  we use a parametric model for the distribution function of mean velocity and velocity dispersion at each point in space . these models include a uniform thermal velocity dispersion and spherical attractors whose position , amplitude , and radial shape are free to vary . </S>",

    "<S> inclusion of two attractors , one of which having a best fit location coincident with the virgo cluster and the other having a fit location slightly beyond the centaurus clusters ( which we refer to by convention as the great attractor ) reduces @xmath2 from 2.1 to 1.1 . </S>",

    "<S> the quality of the fit can be further improved by the addition of a quadrupole correction to the hubble flow . the dipole velocity offset from the cmb frame for the volume we survey </S>",
    "<S> ( amplitude @xmath5 ) and the quadrupole may be genuine ( though weak ) manifestations of more distant density fluctuations , but we find evidence that they are more likely due to the inadequacy of spherical models to describe the density profile of the attractors . </S>",
    "<S> our models can account almost perfectly for the cmb motion of the local group as arising from the attractors within our survey volume ( @xmath6 ) ; in other words , our sampled volume is , in a mass averaged sense , essentially at rest with respect to the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> this contradicts claims of large amplitude flows in much larger volumes that include our sample .    </S>",
    "<S> our best - fitting model , which uses attenuated isothermal mass distributions for the two attractors , has enclosed mass overdensities at the local group of @xmath7  m  for the virgo attractor and @xmath8  m  for the great attractor . without recourse to information about the overdensities of these attractors with respect to the cosmic mean we can not provide a good constraint on @xmath9 , but </S>",
