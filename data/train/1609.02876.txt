    "there is great interest in developing systems for all - optical processing of quantum information @xcite .",
    "experiments performed in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have become increasingly important in this context @xcite .",
    "this regime has been reached using a wide variety of systems , including trapped single atoms @xcite , solid - state quantum emitters @xcite , artificial atoms @xcite , and cold atomic clouds @xcite .",
    "the use of warm atomic ensembles has also been considered @xcite , but has faced complications because of effects related to the thermal motion of the atoms .",
    "compared with single trapped atoms and cold atomic clouds , the theoretical description of warm atomic ensembles interacting with quantized fields is complicated by the presence of doppler broadening .",
    "the resonant frequencies of the atoms , rather than having a single fixed value , are randomly distributed according to the doppler widths of the relevant transitions . in some circumstances",
    "it may be sufficient to first solve the system assuming a fixed atomic frequency , then average the results across the appropriate distribution @xcite .",
    "however this is often not the case , and in general it is necessary to solve the system self - consistently by taking into account the contributions of all doppler velocity groups at once @xcite .    as a result",
    ", it has so far been an open question whether cavity qed with room - temperature atomic vapors can be used for applications in quantum nonlinear optics .",
    "photons in a vapor - filled cavity couple to collective excitations of the entire atomic ensemble .",
    "consequently , doppler broadening of the various velocity groups leads to fast decoherence and can prevent an otherwise useful system from reaching the strong coupling regime .    here",
    "we show that the problem of doppler broadening in cavity qed can be overcome by taking advantage of doppler - free two - photon transitions .",
    "we use the well - known mathematical technique of adiabatic elimination to derive a simplified effective hamiltonian for an ensemble of three - level doppler - broadened atoms in a doubly - resonant cavity .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is valid in the limit of large detuning from the atomic intermediate state , and describes an ensemble of two - level atoms in which the atoms undergo only two - photon transitions @xcite .",
    "we further examine the unitary dynamics of this system for various ways of driving the lower atomic transition . considering counterpropagating light fields",
    "we find that if a classical field is used , the system is equivalent to an ensemble of two - level atoms undergoing single - photon transitions with suppressed doppler broadening . in the case of a single photon driving field , the ensemble collectively behaves like a single two - level atom .",
    "this effective atom absorbs at most one photon from the cavity and then saturates , leading to a nonlinear rabi frequency that increases with the square root of the number of cavity photons . in our approximation , however , the coupling rates for the effective two - level atoms in both of these cases are always much smaller than what would be expected from a single trapped atom optimally placed within the cavity mode .",
    "the process of adiabatic elimination has been described elsewhere @xcite , however for the sake of clarity we begin by presenting a complete derivation in section [ s2 ] .",
    "we describe the adiabatic elimination of the intermediate atomic states in the limit of large detunings , and derive an effective hamiltonian governing the evolution of the system .",

    "decay of the field in resonator mode 1 may reduce the available interaction time as well . dissipation and decoherence are present in all cavity qed systems however , and in many cases these additional mechanisms will not substantively worsen the decay and decoherence rates .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate an ensemble of three - level room - temperature atoms in a two - mode optical cavity , focusing on the case of counterpropagating light fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the limit of large detunings the problem admits relatively simple and intuitive solutions . </S>",
    "<S> when a classical field drives one of the transitions , the system becomes equivalent to an ensemble of two - level atoms with suppressed doppler broadening . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the same transition is driven with a single photon , the system collectively behaves like a single two - level atom . </S>",
    "<S> this latter result is particularly relevant in the context of quantum nonlinear optics . </S>"
