    "quantum electrodynamics in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , the schwinger model @xcite , continues to play an important role as testing ground for field theory ideas . in this paper",
    "we use the schwinger model to study the quenched approximation for the chiral condensate .",
    "the quenched chiral condensate has long been believed , from various indirect arguments , to be an ill - defined quantity in gauge theories in any number of dimensions .",
    "calculations in the schwinger model are much easier than in higher dimensional gauge theories , and this is our motivation for the present study .",
    "one must keep in mind , however , the fact that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is prohibited in two dimensions by the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite . for this reason we also consider the unquenched theory , where chiral symmetry is broken explicitly by the anomaly so that the chiral condensate should be well defined .",
    "the quenched approximation , in which the fermion determinant is discarded when generating the gauge field configurations , was first discussed analytically in this theory by van den doel @xcite . some of the subtleties were subsequently discussed in refs .   and  .",
    "as we shall review in the next section , the indications of disease in the quenched schwinger model very much resemble those in higher - dimensional quenched theories , analyzed by means of quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this may not be surprising , since the bosonized form of the schwinger model @xcite is a two - dimensional analogue of a chiral lagrangian .",
    "the trouble with the quenched chiral condensate then stems , in both contexts , from the famous double pole in the singlet correlation function @xcite .",
    "when analyzed in the finite - volume @xmath1-regime @xcite , the quenched chiral condensate is seen to be plagued with a `` quenched finite - volume logarithm '' at one - loop order in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "taken at face value , that is , if one were to push the expansion beyond its region of validity , this could indicate a divergent condensate .",
    "the analysis of the quenched chiral condensate in the @xmath1-regime has guided us in our present finite - volume calculations .",
    "there have been many monte carlo calculations of the chiral condensate in the schwinger model , both quenched and unquenched ( see @xcite for recent work ) .",
    "the first to study the quenched condensate via the distribution of the lowest dirac operator eigenvalues were farchioni",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "@xcite . they found quite an odd result  agreement with one universality class of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at small volumes , and with another at larger volumes .",
    "we shall return to this issue in detail below .",
    "kiskis and narayanan @xcite reconsidered the problem recently and found evidence for a _ divergent _ quenched chiral condensate , with dirac eigenvalues that did not appear to fit any of the three possible chiral symmetry breaking classes .",
    "we shall see how these last two papers can be reconciled . in the process we shall consider volumes far exceeding what has been studied earlier .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the issues surrounding the quenched chiral condensate , particularly in this two - dimensional setting , and show how analytical arguments favor an ill - defined , divergent quantity . in sec .",
    "iii we turn to our monte carlo simulations of the quenched theory .",
    "we compare numerical results for the distribution of dirac operator eigenvalues with distributions based on the three possible classes of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we show how the distributions drift as the volume is changed , and how this explains the results of ref .  .",
    "moreover , we find that the distributions appear not to converge to any fixed limit , indicating that the spectral density @xmath2 does not attain a finite value at @xmath3 . by way of contrast , we present in sec .  iv numerical results for the unquenched theory ( @xmath0 ) , obtained by reweighting the path integral with the dirac determinant .",
    "our results there are consistent with the detailed predictions of the @xmath1-regime based on the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry due to the anomaly @xcite .",
    "section v contains a brief summary of our results .",
    "analytically , one can treat quenching by means of the replica method that considers @xmath4 identical fermion copies , and then sends @xmath5 at the end .",
    "this can be done trivially in perturbation theory at the fundamental level ; in more than two dimensions it can be done in chiral perturbation theory @xcite . because the fermion determinant is exactly calculable in two dimensions",
    ", it can also be done beyond perturbation theory in the schwinger model .",
    "this was first realized by van den doel @xcite , and we shall here briefly review his calculation ( see also @xcite ) . at the same time we shall make contact with the very similar calculation in four - dimensions , in quenched chiral perturbation theory based on the replica formulation .    in the continuum theory",
    ", we consider the lagrangian @xmath6 with gauge group u(1 ) , coupling @xmath7 , and @xmath4 species of fermions .",
    "a two - dimensional @xmath8-term has been included as well .",
    "since the fermion determinant is exactly calculable in two dimensions , the theory is in large measure soluble .",
    "a convenient representation of the model is its bosonized form @xcite where the lagrangian density , upon an exact integration over the gauge potential , takes the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes normal ordering and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is euler s constant .",
    "although there is no spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking here , the bosonized action  ( [ boso ] ) bears a strong resemblance to chiral lagrangians in four dimensions , with @xmath13 playing the role of a ( dimensionless ) pion decay constant @xcite .",
    "this becomes particularly clear when we consider the theory in an expansion around static ( zero - momentum ) modes .",
    "if we define the partition function in a sector of fixed topological charge @xmath14 by means of  @xcite @xmath15 the integral over @xmath8 can be performed exactly . upon defining the @xmath16 matrix @xmath17 , the terms that survive in the static limit yield a boltzmann factor @xmath18,\\ ] ] in analogy with the result in 4 dimensions @xcite ( here @xmath19 denotes the finite two - dimensional volume ) .",
    "note , however , that the mass term is proportional to @xmath20 rather than to @xmath21 as in four dimensions .",
    "this is crucial for understanding the difference with respect to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the analogy to a four - dimensional chiral lagrangian holds to any order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in particular it is useful for understanding the quenched limit of the theory .",
    "the mass term and its normal - ordering prescription complicate matters slightly , and it suffices to consider the massless limit . in that limit we read off the diagonal scalar propagator from eq .",
    "( [ boso ] ) , @xmath22 which reduces to the classic schwinger result of an ordinary massive propagator when @xmath0 @xcite ; in the quenched limit ( @xmath23 ) a double pole develops , @xmath24 as first noted by van den doel @xcite . this phenomenon is completely analogous to what happens in quenched chiral perturbation theory in four dimensions when formulated in terms of replicas ; see the appropriate replica feynman rule in eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .  .",
    "the only difference is the replacement of the schwinger mass parameter @xmath25 by what is there commonly normalized as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of colors .",
    "( the double pole had of course been observed much earlier in quenched chiral perturbation theory by means of a supersymmetric extension  @xcite . )",
    "the above description of the diagonal scalar propagator glosses over the fact that in two dimensions the propagation of massless degrees of freedom require an infrared regularization .",
    "this is true even when the schwinger mass @xmath28 is taken into account because of the remaining @xmath29-poles in the propagator ( [ nfprop ] ) when @xmath5 .",
    "after regularizing this infrared divergence by an additional mass parameter @xmath30 , the calculation of the chiral condensate requires integration over a closed loop of the propagator @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the arbitrary mass defining the normal - ordering prescription @xcite . from here",
    "the quenched chiral condensate has been computed @xcite to give @xmath33\\rangle \\cr & = & - \\lim_{m_{ir}\\to 0\\atop n_f\\to 0 } cm_{ir}\\left(1+\\frac{n_f\\mu^2}{m_{ir}^2}\\right)^{1/2n_f } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for fixed infrared cutoff @xmath30 , the limit @xmath5 yields @xcite @xmath34 which is infrared divergent .",
    "this ordering of limits seems closest to the actual `` physical '' ( i.e. , computational ) definition of the quenched theory , and we shall view it as the simplest manifestation of the difficulty with defining the quenched schwinger model . since the result is divergent , and since the computation has been done based on an expansion around the massless theory , one can question to what extent the resulting divergence is a truly reliable prediction .",
    "more detailed computations at fixed @xmath19 can be found in refs .   and  .",
    "we consider a lattice with volume @xmath35 and employ a non - compact formulation for the gauge field . in a sector with topological charge @xmath36 , the gauge field @xmath37 may be decomposed @xcite as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a real periodic function with no zero mode , and @xmath40 are two real constants in the interval @xmath41 $ ] that parametrize the two polyakov loops on the 2-d lattice . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are forward and backward finite differences ; @xmath44 represents the gauge degree of freedom .",

    "the continuum limit may be taken at fixed finite @xmath7 and at fixed volume by taking @xmath48 and  @xmath49 to infinity .",
    "alternatively , we can keep @xmath7 and  @xmath49 fixed and vary the physical volume by changing @xmath48 .",
    "our choice of the non - compact action is motivated mainly by the ease with which we can generate independent gauge configurations with the desired topological charge .",
    "successive configurations are generated by a heat bath so that there is no autocorrelation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the sector with zero topological charge .",
    "we employ lattices of linear size @xmath49 ranging from  8 to  60 , and fix @xmath50 .",
    "we also have one data set with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; if we renormalize at fixed @xmath7 as discussed above then this is equivalent to @xmath53 at @xmath50 , allowing us a larger physical volume at modest additional cost .",
    "we use the massless overlap  dirac operator @xcite for the fermions , @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eq : dov}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the hermitian wilson ",
    "dirac operator with mass parameter set to @xmath56 . with this normalization",
    "the eigenvalues of the hermitian overlap  dirac operator @xmath57 lie in the interval @xmath58 $ ] , but there is a wave - function renormalization @xmath59 with respect to the conventional normalization of the dirac operator @xcite that one needs to keep in mind .",
    "for @xmath60 we diagonalize @xmath61 exactly by a householder transformation followed by @xmath62 iteration @xcite . from this",
    "we construct @xmath63 , whose eigenvalues we obtain similarly . for the larger lattices we compute the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath64 with the ritz variational algorithm of kalkreuter and simma  @xcite . here the action of @xmath65 on a vector is obtained using a modified version of the two - pass algorithm @xcite . in the first pass ,",
    "the lanczos algorithm is used to obtain a tridiagonal matrix , @xmath66 , that is a good approximation to @xmath61 . then @xmath67 is obtained by an exact diagonalization of @xmath66 , and the second pass is used to compute the action of @xmath67 on a vector .",
    "previous papers have compared the eigenvalue distributions to the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) , and we shall proceed to do the same . in higher dimensions , where spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is allowed ,",
    "it is by now well known that the lowest eigenvalues of the dirac operator in the @xmath1-regime are distributed according to universal finite - size scaling distributions that can be derived either from rmt @xcite or directly from the chiral lagrangian framework @xcite .",
    "there is ample evidence that the universality class of these distributions is dictated by the way the fermions transform under the gauge group .",
    "this has been demonstrated for three different gauge group representations with overlap fermions @xcite , and for a variety of exotic representations with staggered fermions @xcite .    according to this classification ,",
    "if chiral symmetry could be spontaneously broken in the schwinger model , where the fermions transform as a complex representation , the relevant universality class in rmt terms would be that of the chiral unitary ensemble ( chue ) .",
    "it is by no means clear , however , whether these predictions are of any relevance to the quenched schwinger model , where spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking is prohibited @xcite .",
    "ref .   included such a comparison , but the results were not easy to understand . for small lattices",
    "the eigenvalue distributions appear to fall in with the chiral symplectic ensemble ( chse ) , which should be of relevance to _ real _ fermion representations . for larger lattices",
    "there appears to be a switch to the perhaps more natural chue . with our greater statistics and our larger lattices , we are now able to see that such surprising results do not really hold .",
    "we begin with attempts to fit the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue to the form predicted by rmt for the quenched ( @xmath23 ) chue @xcite , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the condensate @xmath70 is the fit parameter .",

    "it would be interesting to see whether the agreement with rmt persists on larger lattices and whether the continuum value for @xmath70 is correctly reproduced as @xmath81 .",
    "unfortunately , reweighting becomes prohibitive for larger volumes .",
    "a direct numerical simulation of the @xmath0 theory is probably needed .",
    "as we have shown , the quenched schwinger model does not fall into any of the three universality classes of chiral symmetry breaking . in view of the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem , which forbids spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in two dimensions ,",
    "this in itself is not very surprising .",
    "the only possible loophole out of this argument would be to note that the quenched theory is non - unitary and thus it might not satisfy some assumptions of the theorem .",
    "the application of the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem to the quenched theory may be considered in two ways . in the so - called supersymmetric formulation of quenching , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is associated with quenched goldstone bosons and goldstone fermions . in the replica formulation ,",
    "the spontaneous breaking is associated with goldstone bosons alone . in both ways of considering quenching",
    ", the theorem seems to exclude rigorously the possibility of a non - zero condensate . in that light",
    "it is perhaps surprising that the numerical evidence now points towards an ill - defined , divergent chiral condensate , rather than a vanishing condensate .",
    "the schwinger model with @xmath0 is on an entirely different footing due to the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry by the anomaly .",
    "here we have unambiguous analytical predictions for the behavior of dirac operator spectra near the origin , and our @xmath23 results re - weighted with the dirac determinant to simulate the @xmath0 theory are consistent with these analytical predictions . for the _ massive _ schwinger model with @xmath0 ,",
    "a disagreement with rmt must appear as the mass is taken to infinity .",
    "our statistics have not been good enough to attempt the even more ambitious reweighting to simulate the @xmath82 theory .",
    "also here unusual results should appear , presumably with the dirac operator eigenvalues being strongly repelled by the origin so as to produce a vanishing @xmath83 .",
    "for @xmath82 analytical calculations @xcite suggest a behavior @xmath84 and an interesting question is whether such behavior at the rescaled level has a universal distribution from `` critical '' random matrix theories ( the precise behavior ( [ nf2 ] ) is actually realized in a very simple chiral matrix model @xcite ) or analogous eigenvalue models @xcite .",

    "<S> we calculate numerically the eigenvalue distribution of the overlap dirac operator in the quenched schwinger model on a lattice . the distribution does not fit any of the three universality classes of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and its strong volume dependence indicates that the chiral condensate in the quenched theory is an ill - defined and divergent quantity . when we reweight configurations with the dirac determinant to study the theory with @xmath0 , we obtain a distribution of eigenvalues that is well - behaved and consistent with the theory of explicit symmetry breaking due to the anomaly . </S>"
