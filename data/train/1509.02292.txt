    "a pioneering systematic analysis on aa elastic scattering was made by satchler and love @xcite .",

    "the problem on @xmath3li scattering was solved later with cdcc by taking account of projectile - breakup effects @xcite .",
    "projectile breakup is essential for scattering of weakly - bound nuclei .",
    "cdcc is a fully quantum - mechanical method for treating dynamics among various kinds of channels including breakup ( continuum ) channels . for scattering of deuteron ( @xmath8 ) on targets ( t ) , the effects are found to be significant in a wide range of incident energies , say @xmath9 mev , by assuming the @xmath10 model and solving the three - body dynamics with cdcc @xcite .",
    "nowadays , three - body dynamics in scattering of two - body projectiles is often analyzed by cdcc .",
    "our interest is now going to four - body dynamics in scattering of three - body projectiles .",
    "cdcc for three- and four - body scattering are now called three- and four - body cdcc , respectively .",
    "four - body cdcc is an extension of three - body cdcc , but the formulation is not straightforward since it is not easy to prepare the bound and low - lying continuum states of three - body projectile before doing coupled - channel calculations .",
    "this problem was solved by two approaches ; one is the combination @xcite of the pseudostate discretization and the complex scaling method @xcite and the other is the combination @xcite of the momentum - bin discretization and the hyperspherical harmonics method @xcite .",
    "four - body cdcc is one of state - of - the - art calculations in nuclear physics .",
    "three - body projectiles have more complicated structure than two - body ones .",
    "a typical and interesting example is the difference between @xmath0he and @xmath0li .",
    "@xmath0he is a borromean nucleus and is well described by the @xmath11 model .",
    "@xmath0he has no bound state in its two - body subsystems , so that the ground and excited continuum states consist of three - body configurations only .",
    "this property makes four - body dynamics of @xmath0he scattering relatively simpler .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath0li is well described by the @xmath12 model and has a bound state in the @xmath13 subsystem .",
    "therefore , the ground and excited continuum states consist of both @xmath14 two - body and @xmath15 three - body configurations .",
    "in fact , the probability of @xmath14 configurations is about 70% in the ground state .",
    "this situation makes it more difficult to understand four - body dynamics of @xmath0li scattering .",
    "four - body cdcc was first applied to a simpler case , i.e. , @xmath0he scattering .",
    "the analysis was successful in reproducing the experimental data with no adjustable parameter for both elastic and breakup cross sections @xcite .",
    "@xmath0li - breakup effects were first analyzed with three - body cdcc based on the @xmath16 model @xcite .",
    "this analysis showed that @xmath0li breakup effects provide large repulsive corrections to the folding potential .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath0li elastic scattering was not described by the double - folding model .",
    "however , this statement should be reinforced by four - body cdcc .",
    "@xmath0li  +  @xmath4bi elastic scattering at @xmath17 and 32.8 mev near the coulomb - barrier energy @xmath18 mev were first analyzed with three - body cdcc @xcite ; note that @xmath1 stands for an incident energy in the laboratory system .",
    "however , the three - body cdcc calculation could not account for measured elastic cross sections without introducing a normalization factor 0.8 to @xmath8-t and @xmath19-t optical potentials .",
    "the problem was solved by four - body cdcc based on the @xmath20 model @xcite .",
    "in fact , the calculation reproduced the experimental data with no adjustable parameter .",
    "as an interesting result , it was reported that @xmath8 breakup is strongly suppressed in @xmath0li breakup processes of the elastic scattering .",
    "the failure of three - body cdcc comes from the use of the phenomenological @xmath8-t optical potential that includes @xmath8-breakup effects implicitly .",
    "in fact , if the @xmath8-@xmath21 potential is replaced by the single folding potential obtained by folding @xmath22-t and @xmath23-t optical potentials with the @xmath8 ground state , the three - body cdcc calculation well reproduces the experimental data .",
    "thus , the @xmath8-breakup suppression is a key to understanding four - body dynamics in @xmath0li scattering .",
    "the next question to be addressed is whether the @xmath8-breakup suppression is realized also at @xmath24 , even if @xmath8 breakup is important for the corresponding @xmath8 scattering at the same incident energy per nucleon ( the same incident velocity ) @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "this mechanism can be understood as follows .",
    "some of @xmath157-dominant breakup states are concentrated on the low - lying part of excitation spectrum and work as a collective - excitation mode effectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath3li breakup is mainly induced by strong transitions to the breakup states , and consequently , @xmath8 breakup is suppressed in @xmath3li breakup processes .",
    "the @xmath8-breakup suppression may indicate that @xmath3li scattering is described effectively by the @xmath172 three - body model , if the following two points are satisfied .",
    "as for the potential between @xmath8 and @xmath173 , we should use the single - folding potential obtained by folding @xmath105 and @xmath109 with the @xmath8 ground state , since the folding potential does not include @xmath8-breakup effects . as for the projectile ( @xmath3li ) radius important for elastic scattering , the value calculated with the @xmath174 two - body model should be consistent with that with the @xmath175 three - body model . a successful example is shown in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to cdcc calculations without and with coulomb breakup , respectively .",
    "the difference between the two lines is tiny , indicating that coulomb - breakup effects are quite small .",
    "this comes from the lack of electric dipole transitions ; see  appendix  [ sec : e1 ] for the theoretical discussion .",
