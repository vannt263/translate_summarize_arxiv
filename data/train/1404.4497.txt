    "the izergin - korepin ( or @xmath0 ) model is , together with the 6-vertex model , a central part of the field of integrable statistical mechanics models .",
    "it is directly connected - in particular thanks to the reformulation as an @xmath1 model - with many of the most recent developments in conformal field theory , 2d quantum gravity @xcite , combinatorics @xcite probability theory @xcite , algebra @xcite and has also many physical applications , in particular in polymer theory @xcite .",
    "more than thirty years after the discovery of the vertex model @xcite , and more than twenty years after the reformulation as an @xmath1 model @xcite , it seems that everything should be understood about such basic aspects as the nature of the continuum limit , or the spectrum of critical exponents .",
    "quite surprisingly , this is not the case .",
    "the so called regime iii ( see a detailed definition below ) resisted most of the sophisticated attempts started in @xcite , exhibiting unusually large corrections to scaling , and new , disconcerting behavior of the measured gaps with the twist angle .",
    "this has been considered in the community as a technical problem more than a fundamental one , but we show here that something very deep and new is happening : the continuum limit of the izergin korepin model in regime iii is a _ non compact conformal field theory _ , with a continuous spectrum of critical exponents .",
    "this is possible , even though the lattice model is perfectly compact , because the boltzmann weights are not all positive in the regime iii ( the hamiltonian is not hermitian ) , and the correspondence between the lattice and continuum target spaces is more complicated than in the usual , positive ( hermitian ) cases . in the latter case , for the simplest statistical mechanics models such as the ik model in the other regimes or the 6 vertex model ,",
    "the continuum target space is usually a circle , that is , a real variable `` compactified '' by the identification @xmath2 .",
    "the variable @xmath3 is a free boson @xcite , and the compactification arises because of its angular nature .",
    "a non compact target space would correspond , for instance , to a boson with infinite radius of compactification ( @xmath4 ) , but in our case we will see that things are a little more complicated .",
    "this is not the first time that such non compact behavior is encountered . in @xcite and in @xcite",
    "two other lattice models were studied that involve similarly finite - dimensional representations on every site or link , but with a non compact continuum limit , and a continuous spectrum of critical exponents .",
    "these models however were not the most natural or useful from a pure statistical mechanics point of view : the one in @xcite requires a @xmath5 super group symmetry , and the one in @xcite involves a delicate staggering of the spectral parameters . in contrast , the ik model in regime iii is related with very physical questions , in particular the behavior of a leading candidate for the theta point of polymers .",
    "our results will turn out to have profound consequences on our understanding of this point .",
    "the existence of a continuous spectrum of critical exponents means that , for the corresponding conformal field theory , there will be primary fields with dimensions @xmath6 taking a continuous set of values within an interval . in terms of lattice transfer matrices or hamiltonians",
    ", this implies that the rescaled gaps @xmath7  where @xmath8 denotes the length of the system , and @xmath9 is the ground state energy  instead of converging to a discrete set of points in the limit @xmath10 , will take continuous values covering some intervals .",
    "the izergin - korepin and @xmath1 models have been studied at great length , and we will not spend much time reminding the reader of their definition and the vast body of knowledge which is available about them . except for a short reminder of the properties in regime i provided in appendix [ app : b ] , and that we will need for purposes of definition and normalization , we will therefore focus entirely on the regime iii .",
    "we will , however , devote section  [ sec : gen ] to a careful review of the conventions and notations in the literature , in order to identify precisely the model we are interested in .",
    "another point worth recalling here is that the ik and @xmath1 model are not exactly identical : the @xmath1 model is obtained by combining sectors of the ik vertex model with different `` twisted '' boundary conditions and subtracting states , very much in the same way that the potts model is obtained from sectors of the 6 vertex model .",
    "we focus in this paper on the continuum limit of the ik _ vertex _ model , where it is usually implied that this model has periodic boundary conditions , although we will also consider twisted boundary conditions at various points .",
    "the role of these boundary conditions however is mostly to allow us to explore aspects of the ik model itself : the @xmath1 loop model per se will be considered elsewhere .",
    "section  [ sec : betheanalysis ] provides a careful , revised analysis of the numerical results from the bethe ansatz , together with duality arguments that lead to a tentative identification of the continuum limit of the ik model with the eucidian black hole conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite , whose main features are recalled at the beginning of section [ sec : blackholeident ] .",
    "this cft  which can also be considered as the ( gko ) coset @xmath11  has the interesting property that it admits both continuous and discrete states .",
    "the rules giving rise to these discrete states are very specific , and result in a pattern that depends crucially on the coupling constant  which translates here into the anisotropy of the model , or the @xmath12 variable in the @xmath1 version .",
    "we show in section [ sec : blackholeident ] how the lattice model exactly reproduces the results predicted in @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the issue of the density of states , and how the termination of the regime is related with the appearance of a marginally relevant operator .",
    "this allows us to predict an essential singularity in the free energy ( ground state energy ) of the model , whose existence we also prove directly from the bethe ansatz results .",
    "two further appendices contain the derivation of an algebraic rsos formulation ( different from the geometrical one given in @xcite ) used in some of our early arguments about the continuum limit , and a detailed exposition of the numerical method and results .",
    "the izergin - korepin model @xcite is a quantized version of the bullough - dodd model @xcite . it was originally @xcite formulated as a vertex model , but is also closely related to an o(@xmath12 ) type loop model @xcite or as an rsos type height model @xcite ( see also appendix  [ app : a ] ) .    in view of the program",
    "we expect to carry out in this paper and its sequels , it is however most natural to start by giving the standard form of the @xmath13 matrix for the @xmath0 algebra @xcite : @xmath14 here the so(@xmath15 ) braid and temperley - lieb generators satisfy the relationship @xmath16 and the @xmath13 matrices obey the yang baxter equation in the form @xmath17 we denote by @xmath18 the deformation parameter , and by @xmath19 the ( multiplicative ) spectral parameter .",
    "we note that a slightly different normalization is often used for the deformation parameter in the @xmath0 case @xcite .",
    "we will set @xmath20 in all that follows .",
    "explicit calculations show that this matrix matches the more usual ( in the statistical mechanics literature ) form @xcite in terms of weights for the 19 possible vertices encoded in the @xmath21 matrix ( @xmath22 ) acting on the space @xmath23 @xmath24 where the weights can be written ( yb stands for yung and batchelor @xcite ) : @xmath25 provided one sets @xmath26 and implements a gauge transformation on the degrees of freedom on every edge , obtained by simple multiplication with @xmath27 each space @xmath28 is interpreted naturally in terms of spin @xmath29 , and the value of @xmath30 can be represented graphically as an empty edge , or an edge carrying an up / down pointing arrow .",
    "the 19 configurations around a vertex allowed by ( [ 19vrmatrix ] ) are precisely those compatible with arrow conservation , generalizing the ice rule ( which is well - known from the 6-vertex model ) .",
    "the model is closely related to a loop model .",
    "the local configurations around a vertex of the square lattice for this model are the following : @xmath31   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_1 $ } ; \\begin{scope}[xshift=1.5 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,0)--(0.36,0.36 ) arc(-45:45:2mm)--(0,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_2 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=3 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 1,0)--(0.64,0.36 ) arc(225:135:2mm)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_3 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=4.5 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,0)--(0.36,0.36 ) arc(135:45:2mm)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_4 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=6 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,1)--(0.36,0.64 ) arc(-135:-45:2mm)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_5 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=7.5 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_6 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=9 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_7 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=10.5 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,0)--(0.36,0.36 ) arc(-45:45:2mm)--(0,1 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 1,0)--(0.64,0.36 ) arc(225:135:2mm)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_8 $ } ; \\end{scope } \\begin{scope}[xshift=12 cm ]   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,0)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw[thin , black ] ( 0,1)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,0)--(0.36,0.36 ) arc(135:45:2mm)--(1,0 ) ;   \\draw[blue , ultra thick ] ( 0,1)--(0.36,0.64 ) arc(-135:-45:2mm)--(1,1 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.5,0 ) node[below ] { $ \\rho_9 $ } ; \\ , , \\end{scope } \\end{tikzpicture } \\label{onweights}\\ ] ] and there is an additional weight @xmath12 per closed loop , henceforth referred to as the loop fugacity . to bring the loop model into correspondence with the 19-vertex model one",
    "first introduces an extra orientational degree of freedom ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) for each loop .",
    "the fugacity @xmath12 is then distributed over these orientations and further over the local turns .",
    "summing over the loop connectivities compatible with each choice of arrows ( orientation ) on the adjacent edges finally produces a vertex model .",
    "choosing correctly the gauge factors allowed by these transformations produces the vertex weights ( zb stands for zhou and batchelor @xcite ) @xmath32 and the loop fugacity @xmath33 the correspondence with the earlier parameters is @xmath34 that is as well @xmath35 finally , the same appears in the literature with different conventions .",
    "the weights in warnaar , batchelor and nienhuis ( wbn ) @xcite are obtained by yet a further gauge transformation , where each vertex is multiplied by a factor @xmath36 with @xmath37 denoting the states on the edges ( equal to @xmath38 ) and @xmath39    having clarified the relations between all these different conventions , we shall from now on eschrew the use of the various subscripted parameters and stick exclusively with the multiplicative spectral parameter @xmath19 and the crossing parameter @xmath18 ( or their additive equivalents @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) defined in ( [ ourparameters ] ) .",
    "also , our main focus shall be on the vertex model ( although we shall occasionnally need the rsos version as well ) , and we shall put the emphasis on the algebraic formulation ( [ ikrmat ] ) of the @xmath13 matrix .",
    "for a system of length @xmath8 sites with ( twisted ) periodic boundary conditions , the row to row transfer matrix in the vertex representation is defined as usual , @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes for the horizontal , auxilliary space , on which acts the operator @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the twist angle .",
    "the corresponding spin chain hamiltonian can be obtained by taking the very anisotropic limit @xmath46 , namely @xmath47 it is given by equation ( 6.1 ) of @xcite ; a particularly important aspect is that it is not hermitian .",
    "we consider the @xmath18-deformed @xmath0 model , which is related to the o(@xmath12 ) loop model as described in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "the twist will play a very important role later in this work , and will be introduced in section  [ sec : twist ] .",
    "but until then we shall consider exclusively the untwisted case",
    ".    setting @xmath48 , as in ( [ ourparameters ] ) , the untwisted bethe equations have the form ( in the homogeneous case ) @xmath49 the eigenenergies of the hamiltonian take the form @xmath50 we emphasize that the system of bethe equations and the energy can not be mapped onto each other under @xmath51 .",
    "this means that we need to consider @xmath52 $ ] and the two signs of energy in ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "when @xmath41 runs through the interval @xmath53 $ ] , the loop fugacity @xmath54 covers the range @xmath55 $ ] twice . in view of the two possible signs of @xmath56",
    "there are therefore four different sets of integrable weights ( [ zbweights ] ) corresponding to each choice of @xmath57 .",
    "these were referred to as branches 1,2,3,4 in @xcite . from the point of view of integrability and conformal properties",
    "it is however more important to distinguish between three regimes ( called i , ii and iii in @xcite ) that each correspond to distinct structural properties of the bethe ansatz solution and of the cft universality classes .",
    "the case @xmath58 corresponds to the regime i in @xcite , where the ground state is obtained with @xmath59 roots having an imaginary part equal to @xmath60 .",
    "this covers branches 1 and 2 of @xcite that can be interpreted physically as the dilute and dense phases of the o(@xmath12 ) model .",
    "the case @xmath61 corresponds to regimes ii , iii in @xcite .",
    "more precisely we have : @xmath62 \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mbox{regime iii } : & \\gamma \\in [ 0,\\frac{\\pi}{3 } ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{regimes23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the conventions of @xcite , regime iii corresponds to the part of branch 3 with @xmath63 $ ] , whereas regime ii covers the remainder or branch 3 and all of branch 4 .",
    "the physical behavior on branches 3 and 4 was originally suggested @xcite to be that of the dilute and dense phases of the o(@xmath12 ) model with an extra ising degree of freedom ( see also appendix a of @xcite ) , but it was noticed @xcite that for the part of branch 3 that corresponds to regime iii the convergence of the finite - size numerical estimates for the central charge and critical exponents was anomalously bad .",
    "this issue will be clarified in the present paper .",
    "we also note that the value @xmath64 in regime iii can be identified with a model of the theta point of polymers ( see below ) ; it corresponds to @xmath65 .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 in @xcite must be identified with @xmath67 .",
    "a naive analysis would suggest the ground state in regimes ii and iii is obtained by filling a sea of real @xmath59 .",
    "this is however not the case .",
    "in fact , the ground state is made of complexes with imaginary parts close to @xmath68 : @xmath69 note that these @xmath70-strings are not the usual ones , in that the gap in imaginary parts is equal to @xmath71 , not @xmath41 ; this is possible because the right - hand side of the bethe equations contains a ratio of cosine terms , that results from the twisting of @xmath72 .",
    "we emphasize that here we use the term ` twist ' is in the sense of affine quantum algebras and solutions of the yang baxter equation @xcite .",
    "this has nothing to do with the ` twist angle ' that appears in the bethe equations .",
    "the same @xmath70-strings build the ground state in regime ii and regime iii .",
    "differences arise however in the corrections to the asymptotic shape of the complexes , as well as the analytical behavior of the bethe kernels .",
    "the two signs of energy in ( [ energy ] ) can be identified with two particular values of the spectral parameter @xmath40 corresponding to local maxima of the bethe eigenvalues : @xmath73 in other words , the states corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues at @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) are the low - energy states for @xmath61 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) .",
    "note that in terms of the o(@xmath12 ) weights ( [ zbweights ] ) the choice @xmath74 ( resp .",
    "@xmath75 ) corresponds to @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( resp .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "both choices are however isotropic points , since the model is gauge invariant under changing the signs of various weights @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "two other special choices of the spectral parameter are relevant for bringing the square - lattice o(@xmath12 ) model in equivalence with the better - known o(@xmath12 ) model on the hexagonal lattice @xcite . indeed , when @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) we have @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) and the vertices ( [ onweights ] ) can be pulled apart vertically ( resp .",
    "horizontally ) so as to produce a pair of vertices on the hexagonal lattice . in both cases",
    "this produces an isotropic loop model with monomer fugacity @xmath84 ; the sign of @xmath85 is immaterial since loops on the hexagonal lattice have even length .",
    "we note that for the isotropic square - lattice model , all three regimes correspond to the dominant eigenvalues for some range of parameter values , cf .",
    "( [ regimes23 ] )",
    ". however , for the hexagonal - lattice model regime i always determines the dominant eigenvalues , and so in that case regimes ii and iii can be considered irrelevant .",
    "we define fourier transforms via @xmath86 and use the basic formulas @xmath87 provided @xmath88 , that is in regime iii , the bare equations for the centers of the complexes read @xmath89 the corresponding physical equations are @xmath90 from which we deduce the density of roots and the bulk ground state energy , namely @xmath91 where @xmath92    the model has gapless excitations obtained by making holes in the ground state at large rapidities .",
    "conformal properties can be obtained by studying corrections to scaling .",
    "the central charge of the untwisted model is found , after considerable analytical work , to be @xcite @xmath93 excitations obtained by removing complexes from the ground state can be handled analytically @xcite .",
    "the final result is in agreement with the usual formula @xcite , based on the kernel @xmath85 of the general form of the bare bethe equations @xmath94 .",
    "we have here , at vanishing frequency , @xmath95 , so the conformal weights read @xmath96 where @xmath12 is twice the number of holes of complexes ( a complex containing two bethe roots ; one has in fact @xmath97 , with @xmath98 the spin of the excitation , in units where arrow in the vertex model carry @xmath99 ) , and the number @xmath100 measures global shifts of the fermi sea ( backscattering from left to right or right to left ) .",
    "this expression for the conformal weights is checked numerically in appendix  [ app : c ] .",
    "the conformal weights themselves are also easily extracted from the calculation of the momentum , leading to @xmath101 this part is easily interpreted as occuring from a compact bosonic degree of freedom , similar to the one characteristic of regime i , and thus the `` usual '' dilute and dense phases of the @xmath1 model .    of course , since the central charge is @xmath102 , there must be more degrees of freedom . the possibility of having two majorana fermions  each contributing an extra @xmath103 to the central charge  is quickly excluded from numerics .",
    "there is however evidence for a second bosonic degree of freedom , but of a peculiar nature .",
    "there is an elegant way to see why the continuum limit in regime iii should be made of one compact and one non compact boson .",
    "it uses a duality argument quite similar to the one presented in @xcite for a related model .",
    "we recall the fact that there are two @xmath13 matrices associated with the fundamental representation of @xmath104 @xcite : @xmath105 while @xmath106 corresponds to the spin - one version of the xxz spin chain , @xmath107 coresponds to the ik model @xcite .",
    "whenever @xmath118 , with @xmath119 an integer , that is @xmath120 , we can thus relate some of the properties of the ik chain ( @xmath107 , @xmath121 ) with those of the @xmath122 ` ordinary ' ( i.e. , type 1 ) yang baxter chain .",
    "now , careful study of the domains of variation of spectral parameters shows that the ik model in regime iii maps to the @xmath122 model in the regime where its continuum limit @xcite is given by the conformal cosets @xmath123 and their natural coulomb gas extensions . finally , it is easy to recognize ( see below ) these particular cosets as parafermionic theories .",
    "the conclusion of this long chain of arguments is thus that the ik model in regime iii should be closely related , when @xmath120 , @xmath124 an integer , to parafermionic theories .",
    "while this general argument is perfectly correct , it requires a bit of care to be applied in detail .",
    "a first point is , that the @xmath13 matrices correspond to a very particular choice of ` gauge ' in the yang baxter equation , and that an integrable periodic system built out of them will correspond , in the usual vertex model or spin chain language , to a system with a certain twist angle .",
    "hence the equivalence we discuss , strictly speaking , will hold only for specifically twisted versions of the models .",
    "second , this equivalence can not hold for all aspects of the model since the size of the hilbert space is not even the same !",
    "the duality can however be made totally precise and accurate if we move from the vertex models or spin chains to their quantum group restricted , solid on solid version - the rsos models .",
    "the situation is then similar to what was discussed in the case of @xmath125 in @xcite .",
    "we now distinguish between even and odd values of @xmath124 : @xmath126 the first theory is known to coincide with @xmath127 parafermions , and is denoted @xmath128 in @xcite . the second is known to coincide with @xmath129 parafermions , and is denoted @xmath130 in @xcite . the conclusion of our analysis is thus that proper rsos versions of the ik model at these values of @xmath124 in regime iii should be described by these parafermionic theories in the continuum limit .    more generally - and",
    "although the duality argument does not apply in this case , it is natural to expect that there is nothing special with parafermionic theories with even index , and , therefore , that more generally the rsos versions of the ik model in regime iii for @xmath131 , @xmath132 an integer ( the previous cases correspond only to @xmath133 even ) should be described , at low energy , by the @xmath134 conformal field theories .",
    "the values of @xmath132 covers the interval @xmath135 , corresponding to the models @xmath136 .    before using our results on the rsos version to deduce properties of the vertex model itself ,",
    "it is important to present some numerical checks of our claim .",
    "first , we must warn the reader that there are several ways to associate a rsos model to the ik model .",
    "the best known - and probably most physical - way consists in interpreting the loops in the @xmath1 model as frontiers of height domains , leading eventually do a ` dilute ' version of the regular rsos models associated with the 6 vertex model .",
    "this is _ not _ what we must do here , where instead we with to use the full symmetry algebra of the model at the critical point .",
    "therefore , our rsos models will be obtained by exploiting the full @xmath137 spin one symmetry , interpreting the quantum spins as heights , and obtaining the weights via 6j calculus . in this sense",
    ", our rsos model will be related with ( but different from ) the ` fused ' models @xcite of the @xmath137 hierarchy .",
    "the difference lies in the boltzmann weights : the usual spin one fused model is based on @xmath106 , while here we use of course @xmath107 .",
    "details of the model , the face weights and the construction are provided in appendix  [ app : a ] . for @xmath132 integer ,",
    "the heights on each face take integer or half integer values between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the heights on neighboring sites vary by @xmath138 , @xmath140 or @xmath141 , so the heights are either all integer or all half integer , which defines two a priori different models .",
    "numerical diagonalization of the corresponding transfer matrix however shows that the leading eigenvalues are the same for both models .",
    "measures of the central charges for @xmath142 are displayed in figure  [ fig : c_rsos ] .",
    "they agree very well with our expectation of a @xmath134 parafermionic continuum limit , since for these theories @xmath143 .",
    "further evidence regarding the operator content will appear below .    .",
    "the blue , purple , yellow and green dots correspond to infinite - size extrapolations from sizes @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 respectively . ]    now , there is no reason not to assume  as is usually the case  that the low energy physics of the ik chain can be described a coulomb gas ( see e.g.@xcite ) , whose field content ( that is , the number and type of free fields ) is independent of the coupling @xmath41 in the regime iii .",
    "there are , meanwhile , two known coulomb gas descriptions of the @xmath134 parafermions .",
    "one of them @xcite involves a @xmath132 dependent number of fields , and would lead , via the duality , to a @xmath41 dependent number of fields in the description of regime iii , a fact which is not only unpleasant but for which there is no numerical evidence .",
    "the other coulomb gas description @xcite involves simply two fields , independently of @xmath132 , and is a natural candidate for us .",
    "we will see precisely later how this description fits the ik model . for now , it is enough to recall that it involves two bosons : one which is compact , and the other which is _ non compact_. the natural conclusion is that the same should apply to the ik model , and that , on top of the compact bosonic degreee of freedom identified earlier , we should have , an extra contribution of @xmath148 to the central charge , corresponding to a non compact degree of freedom .",
    "this is what we now establish from a numerical point of view .",
    "we now discuss the low lying levels in the untwisted ( periodic ) case in regime iii .",
    "we label these levels by two integers @xmath12 , @xmath149 .",
    "the first index is the magnetization ( @xmath150 in the spin - one language ) , related to the number of bethe roots @xmath151 by @xmath152 .",
    "the second index is the level of the excitation within given magnetization sector - we will make this definition more precise in terms of the bethe roots shortly . note that these levels are defined for any value of the twist parameter , even though we first consider the zero - twist case .",
    "note also that in this part we restrict to the states of zero momentum , that is , @xmath153 in the notations of ( [ fssiii ] ) .    for all states we proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors at small sizes @xmath8 , by direct diagonalization of the transfer matrix .",
    "2 .   identify the corresponding bethe roots by the so - called mccoy method @xcite : the integrability of the model ensures that the eigenvalues of the properly rescaled transfer matrix are polynomials in @xmath19 , whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of the bethe roots .",
    "having found an eigenvector , it is then straightforward to identify the corresponding bethe roots ( see appendix  [ app : c ] for more details about this method ) .",

    "this can be seen also if we directly put @xmath241 in the formula for @xmath238 : we get then the central charge of the black hole sigma model @xmath242 , which , as mentioned earlier , corresponds to the non normalizable ground state , that is , a ` state ' which is not in the spectrum .",

    "the cutoff for the target space implies that the wave function vanishes at @xmath356 , which leads , from ( [ asympwf ] ) to the quantization condition @xmath357 note that we have added here an extra phase shift @xmath358 at the extremity @xmath359 since the wave function is required to vanish there .",

    "gets a quantization of @xmath206 , and thus a density of states @xmath362 the first term is the part that becomes divergent when the cutoff is removed @xmath363 .",
    "the second term in this expression is the finite contribution to the density of states . as discussed in @xcite , it is in fact related with the amplitude @xmath364 in equation ( [ c/12conj ] ) .",
    "but while this amplitude could be determined by a mixture of analytical and numerical techniques in the case of the @xmath179 staggered 6-vertex model , the presence of strings in the ground state of the ik model in regime iii prevents us from doing this  for now at least .",
    "we will thus focus on the first term in ( [ densnaive ] ) , which , as we will see shortly , is closely related with the amplitude @xmath365 .    indeed",
    ", we will make the natural assumption that the cutoff in target space is related to the amplitude of the irrelevant operator determining the corrections to scaling in the lattice model . in general",
    ", this operator can be written in the liouville form @xmath366 , up to derivatives .",
    "a term @xmath367 in the action will give rise to an effective cutoff @xmath368 assuming that @xmath369 does not depend on the coupling @xmath132 , we then find , from the scaling dimension of @xmath322 determined earlier in ( [ girrscal ] ) @xmath370 and thus , at leading order , we expect that @xmath371 to connect this result with the amplitude @xmath365 , it is now convenient to think of the generating function of levels , which takes the form @xmath372 we can , at large @xmath8 , transform the discrete sum into an integral , and match the exponents with the expected form @xmath373 .",
    "hence @xmath374 this shows that the density of states obtained from the lattice model is , at leading order @xmath375 comparing the expressions ( [ rhosi ] ) and ( [ rhosii ] ) shows that @xmath376 in agreement with the numerical results staggered 6-vertex model the amplitude @xmath173 takes a different form @xcite .",
    "this is related with the fact that the operator determining the corrections to scaling in this model has a coupling - independent dimension  which is expected , since the model admits only local conserved quantities . ]",
    "( see eq .",
    "[ numresfora ] in appendix  [ app : c ] ) .",
    "we note that , while the argument determined @xmath173 unambiguously ( up to a proportionality constant ) , it would work as well if the quantization condition was of the form @xmath377 with @xmath203 an arbitrary additional phase shift .",
    "such a phase shift might arise from a modification of the reflection amplitude , or a more detailed analysis of the effect and nature of the cutoff at @xmath359 . to our knowledge , this has never been discussed before in the literature .",
    "it does play a role of course in the finite size corrections for levels of the spin chain .",
    "we see for instance in equations ( [ xnone ] ) and ( [ xntwo ] ) that the phase shift @xmath203 seems to depend on the parity of the quantum number @xmath12 with @xmath378 while this may seem a minor detail , no such effect was observed in the staggered 6 vertex model , which suggests that the precise mapping of the lattice models to the black hole cft is a bit different in the two cases .",
    "the result ( [ phashi ] ) has an important consequence however : the scaling of the ground state corresponds to @xmath379 in the ik case , and thus is affected by strong @xmath380 corrections .",
    "this did not occur in the staggered 6 vertex model at all , where the corresponding phase shift was @xmath381 , and the ground state did not exhibit any unusual corrections to scaling .",
    "the fact that regime iii of the ik model has a non compact continuum limit seems rather unexpected and exciting to us .",
    "it is particularly remarkable that , while the staggered 6 vertex model may have appeared a bit artificial in its construction , the @xmath1 model , which is deeply related with the ik model , and , as will be discussed elsewhere , exhibits the same non compact features , is perfectly natural and ` physical ' .",
    "our observation of a non compact continuum limit will have especially striking consequences in this case @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ik model is technically much more challenging than the staggered 6 vertex model . in the latter case",
    ", it was easy to establish analytically the existence of the continuum spectrum by using singularities in the bethe ansatz kernels .",
    "there is no such obvious possibility here .",
    "while the roots have imaginary parts that depend on the size of the system , naive equations written for the complexes in the thermodynamic limit do not exhibit any special feature suggesting the existence of a non compact component .",
    "indeed , adding roots with imaginary part @xmath60 and density @xmath382 leads to the following naive physical equations @xmath383 and @xmath384 which , at least at first sight , seem perfectly innocuous .",
    "this means also that the world of spin chains with non compact continuum limit might be much bigger than initially suspected .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "our future work will in fact include a discussion of the continuous spectrum of exponents in the @xmath1 and in particular the polymer models @xcite , a discussion of @xmath385 with applications to a two colour loop model @xcite , and a general discussion of @xmath386 @xcite .",
