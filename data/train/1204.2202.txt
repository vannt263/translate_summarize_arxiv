    "we first prove the direction implication .",

    "note that in our construction the number of @xmath2-track intervals for each literal is at least the number of @xmath2-track intervals for all clauses that contain the literal .",

    "assign @xmath24 false if the clique includes the @xmath2-track intervals for its positive literal , and assign @xmath24 true if the clique includes the @xmath2-track intervals for its negative literal .",
    "thus we obtain an assignment for @xmath9 that satisfies at least @xmath44 clauses in @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the maximum number of clauses in @xmath10 that can be satisfied by an assignment of @xmath9 , and let @xmath52 be the maximum size of a clique in @xmath22 . by lemma  [ l1 ] , we have @xmath53 .",
    "since each clause in @xmath10 is the conjunction of exactly two literals of the variables in @xmath9 , we have @xmath54 .",
