    "observations of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , particularly those from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , form the foundations of the current ( `` concordance '' ) cosmological model @xcite . however , wmap has also uncovered tantalizing evidence of departures from the standard framework . in particular , detailed analysis of the pattern of temperature fluctuations has led to the identification of a _ cold spot _ @xcite .",
    "the level of departure from isotropy is relatively small but it is highly significant from a statistical point of view .",
    "the presence of this feature seems to be inconsistent with the assumption of global isotropy upon which the concordance cosmology is based and could be evidence that we live in a globally anisotropic universe , i.e. one not described by a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model .",
    "the bianchi classification arranges all possible spatially homogeneous but anisotropic relativistic cosmological models into types depending on the symmetry properties of their spatial hypersurfaces @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that localized features in the radiation background can occur in bianchi models with negative spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of such features lies in the focussing effect of spatial curvature on the geodesics that squeezes the pattern of the anisotropic radiation field into a small region of the sky .",
    "only a few of the bianchi types contain the frw model as a limiting case and , from this subset the model which appears to best able to reproduce the anomalous cold spot is the bianchi vii@xmath1 case @xcite .",
    "however , as well as forming distinctive features in the temperature pattern , anisotropic cosmological models also generate characteristic signatures in the polarized component of the background radiation .",
    "thomson scattering generates polarization as long as there is a quadrupole anisotropy in the temperature field of the radiation incident upon the scattering particle . in the concordance",
    "cosmology the temperature and polarization patterns are ( correlated ) stochastic fields arising from their common source in scalar and tensor perturbations arising from inflation . in a bianchi cosmology , however , the patterns are coherent and have a deterministic relationship to one another owing to their common geometric origin .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that the properties of the polarization field produced in bianchi vii@xmath1 are inconsistent with the latest available wmap polarization data @xcite because they inevitably involve a large odd - parity ( b - mode ) contribution that exceeds the experimental upper limit .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we present an exhaustive study of the temperature and polarization anisotropies produced by those bianchi types that possess an frw limit @xcite .",
    "the purpose of studying these models is to characterize as fully as possible the radiation fields they can produce in order to separate them as clearly as possible from residual systematics and thus provide the strongest possible constraints on exotic cosmologies . in the present paper , however , we focus on the very specific question of whether localized spots necessarily involve a large b - mode polarization .",
    "the models we consider are based on einstein s general theory of relativity and we use the field equations in the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the ricci tensor , @xmath4 the ricci scalar , @xmath5 the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath6 the cosmological constant .",
    "indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 run from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "we use units where @xmath11 . in terms of a coordinate system @xmath12 , the metric @xmath13",
    "is written @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fluid velocity ; the signature of @xmath13 is @xmath16 .",
    "starting from a local coordinate system @xmath17 we construct a tetrad basis @xcite @xmath18 such that @xmath19 meaning that the tetrad basis @xmath20 is orthonormal .",

    "we now take the time - like vector in our basis to be the fluid flow velocity so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining space - like vectors form an orthonormal triad , with a set of commutation relations like that shown in equation ( [ comm ] ) but with an explicit time dependence in the `` structure constants '' describing the spatial sections : @xmath31=\\gamma_{ij}^{k}(t ) { \\bf e}_{k}.\\ ] ] without loss of generality we can write @xmath32 for some tensor @xmath33 and some vector @xmath34 .",
    "the jacobi identities require that @xmath35 so we choose @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the four remaining free parameters are used to construct the bianchi classification described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we are interested in cosmological models that are close to the homogeneous and isotropic frw case , but not all the bianchi types contain this solution .",
    "those that do are types i , v , vii@xmath38 , vii@xmath0 and ix .",
    "bianchi i and bianchi vii@xmath38 are spatially flat , bianchi ix is positively curved and bianchi types v and vii@xmath0 have negative spatial curvature .",
    "the open cases are of particular interest in this paper as they permit the focussing of anisotropic patterns into small regions of the sky .",

    "vii@xmath1 we have @xmath42 but @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; the parameter @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 .",
    "if we take @xmath47 , the canonical form of the model , we also have @xmath48 .",
    "the models we consider have a single preferred axis of symmetry .",
    "the alignment of the shear eigenvectors relative to this preferred axis determines not only the dynamical evolution of the model through the field equations , but also the temperature and polarization pattern that gets imprinted into the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the transfer equation for polarized radiation propagating through space - time can be described by a combination of propagation vector and a polarization vector . in the tetrad frame",
    "these can be written as @xmath49 in terms of the standard stokes parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the superscripts indicate the parts of the ( complex ) photon distribution involving spin weights @xmath9 and @xmath54 .",
    "the direction of a light ray in three - dimensional space is defined by @xmath55 and we have also used the complex unit vector @xmath56 neglecting shear - dependent terms in the geodesic equation , the following equation can be obtained @xcite that describes the evolution of the direction of propagation : @xmath57 @xmath58 is the photon energy .",
    "this leads to @xmath59\\sin\\theta \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\frac{d\\phi}{dt } & = & \\left[n_1-n_3 + ( n_3-n_2 ) \\cos^2 \\phi\\right ] \\cos\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radiation distribution described by @xmath60 is affected by the properties of the geodesics along which photons propagate but is also altered by scattering . if only elastic scattering is included , this is governed by a boltzmann equation @xmath61 involving the operator @xmath62 where @xmath63 the optical depth ; the amplitude of the polarization depends strongly on @xmath63 but we shall not explore its dependence in detail in this paper .",
    "the horizontal bar denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we also have @xmath64 , so the non - zero connection terms are given by @xmath65 if we assume no vorticity ( @xmath66 ) and no acceleration ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the boltzmann operator ( [ boltz ] ) involves terms that describe the propagation of the radiation field along the geodesics , the effect of the shear on the photon energy distribution , and the rotation of the polarization angle @xmath68 defined by @xmath69 .",
    "the emission term @xmath70 ( which involves terms describing the fluid flow ) contains only harmonics up to @xmath71 , since the radiation modes with @xmath72 are damped as well as re - radiated by thomson scattering , while higher - order modes @xmath73 are only damped .    .",

    "the polarized field in the latter case has no b - mode.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=20.0% ]    it has become conventional to decompose the polarized component of the cosmic microwave background into modes classified according to their parity .",
    "the even modes are called e - modes and the odd modes are the b - modes .",
    "the latter are of particular interest in the context of inflationary cosmology as they can not be sourced by scalar perturbations and are therefore generally supposed to be a signature of the presence of primordial tensor perturbations , i.e. gravitational waves",
    "@xcite @xmath74 @xmath75 the overall _ level _ of polarization ( in both e and b modes ) increases strongly with the optical depth to thomson scattering @xmath63 through ( [ boltza ] ) .    however , the equations of the previous section for the evolution of the polarized radiation distribution allow us to establish some firm implications for the relative size e and b modes just by considering their symmetry .",
    "first , the scattering term @xmath76 produces a pure e - mode quadrupole anisotropy .",
    "however , depending on the initial conditions , the redshifting effect of shear can produce either e or b modes ( just as a gravitational wave perturbation of frw can ) .",
    "the physical processes described by equations ( 14)-(17 ) can , in principle , convert e modes into b modes and vice versa . in bianchi",
    "vii@xmath1 these effects are _ unavoidable _ so , even if there is no initial b - mode , one is inevitably generated as the universe evolves . in bianchi",
    "v , however , the last term in equation ( 17 ) does not contribute to the mixing of e and b modes , at least at this level of perturbation theory . since initial conditions exist in which the polarization is purely e mode there are therefore models of this type that can produce spots without any b modes .",
    "figure 1 , which was plotted using the healpix software @xcite , shows illustrative examples of bianchi vii@xmath1 and bianchi v that show localized patterns with and without b - modes respectively .",
    "we have shown that it is possible , in a bianchi v cosmological model , to generate a localized temperature anomaly qualitatively similar to the known cold spot without necessarily producing a large b - mode polarization .",
    "observational limits on the b mode alone are therefore not sufficient to exclude global anisotropy as a possible explanation of the famous cold spot .",
    "although the set of bianchi models that can evade the limits set by b mode polarization is small , a more rigorous analysis requires a fuller parametrization in which the bianchi parameters are constrained with other cosmological parameters ( such as the optical depth ) using a complete description of the polarized radiation field .",
    "we stress that there are severe difficulties with anisotropic universes as explanations for the overall pattern of observed cmb anomalies .",
    "most important among these is that a significant ( negative ) spatial curvature seems to be at odds with measurements that clearly prefer a flat universe @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these models may provide important clues that can lead to more effective and efficient use of observations to test exotic cosmologies .",
    "for example , there are other ways in which the polarization angle for cmb photons can be rotated @xcite ; the lack of any observed b - mode allows present observations to place strong constraints on such models also @xcite .",
