    "practically all democratic countries are faced with the problem of selecting members of their legislative bodies according to votes of their population .",
    "the method by which this selection of representatives is performed is commonly known as an _ election method_. its main function is to transform the election results , which are usually the number of votes for various candidates or parties , into whole numbers which usually give the number of seats in a legislative body .",
    "nearly every democratic country employs its own favourite election method .",
    "this immediately leads to the question of which election method is in some sense optimal and most just ?",
    "this is not an easy question to answer as one can see from the vast amount of literature it has generated .",
    "history shows that at various times different election methods were in favour and many countries have changed their election method in the past .",
    "one can distinguish between two major types of election methods , namely the _ majority voting methods _ and the _ proportional voting methods_. the majority voting method is used , for example , in great britain to elect members of parliament and in the united states of america to elect members of the congress . in this method , the eligible voters are divided into voting districts and , in its purest form , each district elects one candidate by majority vote .",
    "it is well known that the percentage of members in parliament or congress belonging to a given party need not be close to the percentage of votes this party obtained overall .",
    "for this reason , we do not consider this voting method in this paper .    among the most frequently discussed proportional voting systems are the dhondt or jefferson method ( e.g. used in germany until 1983 , still used in many countries ) , the hare or hamilton method ( used e.g.   in germany , tasmania , used in the us 1840 to 1890 ) and sainte - lagu or webster method ( used in new zealand ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present a general treatment of all proportional voting methods .",
    "mathematically , the accuracy of a voting method can be measured by a so - called _ error function _ , a function which measures the gravity of the error between the exact votes and the allocated seats . in practice error functions",
    "are dictated by courts or legislative bodies and these error functions need not coincide with mathematical error functions .",
    "we show in theorem  [ the : main ] how to find a proportional voting method which minimises a given error function",
    ". a slightly weaker version of this theorem has been announced by niemeyer and wolf ( 1984 ) , @xcite .",
    "here we give a first complete proof .",
    "we demonstrate how most of the well known election methods can be obtained from this general result by special choices of error functions .",
    "the hare method can be singled out by the fact that it minimises infinitely many different error functions .",
    "this is certainly not the case for the methods of dhondt and sainte - lagu .",
    "another aim of this paper is to give a mathematical argument as to why the hare method is the best among the proportional voting methods .",
    "each voting method can lead to results which appear paradoxical .",
    "we discuss various paradoxa which have enjoyed a lot of attention in the literature , for example , the so - called alabama paradox for the hare method .",
    "we argue that in many cases the `` paradoxity '' is only in the eye of the beholder .",
    "in particular , the methods of dhondt and sainte - lagu are blessed with their own paradoxa .",
    "this paper is concerned with four different but mathematically related problems .",
    "first there is the apportionment problem as seen in the example of the american house of representatives of the united states congress , where each state of the union is entitled to a number of seats , at least one , according to and as closely proportional as possible to its number of legal inhabitants .",
    "the latter is determined every ten years by a census of the united states .",
    "each state is subdivided into voting districts according to how many seats are assigned to it and the representatives of each district are assigned by a majority vote .",
    "second there is the apportionment problem for political parties participating in an election of a country where seats in the parliament are assigned to parties as proportionally as possible to the election results . as an example we can take the german federal election .",
    "germany is divided into voting districts .",
    "the number of seats in parliament is twice the number of voting districts .",
    "voters receive a ballot on which there are two votes . the second vote ( zweitstimme )",
    "is cast for a political party .",
    "the number of seats in parliament is assigned to eligible parties as proportionally as possible to these second votes .",
    "( a party is eligible if it received at least 5% of the total number of second votes or at least three seats by first vote . )",
    "the first vote ( erststimme ) is to determine by simple majority a representative for the voting district in parliament .",
    "the elected candidates receive seats in parliament which are counted towards the allocated number of seats of the party they represent .",
    "the remaining seats are distributed among the participating parties according to the second votes and according to the election method used .",
    "it may happen that a party obtains more seats by the first vote ( erststimme ) than is allowed according to the second vote ( zweitstimme ) .",
    "the parties keep those seats and they are called `` berhangmandate '' . using a first and second vote , the federal elections combines the important feature of the majority election methods , that each voting district is represented by a member of parliament , with the advantage of proportional election methods , by which the number of seats allocated to a party is as closely proportional to the number of votes as possible .",
    "of course , there is always the difficulty that one or more parties get more seats directly than by the number of total votes .",
    "the third problem is that of rounding a list of given numbers , so that the total sum of the rounded numbers equals the rounded ( standard rounded ) sum .",
    "the easiest example perhaps is that of rounding percentage numbers , which add up to 100% , but after ( standard ) rounding fail to add up to 100% .",
    "another problem can be the amount of exports of a certain commodity given in euro by each country of the european community , for instance .",
    "the press publishes figures representing the exports of each country rounded to millions of euros . the total amount is also rounded to the nearest million independently of the individual figures .",
    "now the problem is that the rounded figures should add up to the rounded total .",
    "the fourth problem comes from operations research .",
    "let us assume that a factory is producing indivisible goods , e.g.  cars of the same make .",
    "the profit is to be distributed among the share holders as closely proportional to the number of shares as possible .      in all of these problems",
    "we can start with a positive integer @xmath0 , where @xmath0 represents the number of seats in the first and second problem ; @xmath0 denotes the sum of the rounded integers in the third problem ; @xmath0 is the number of goods produced in the fourth problem .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the number of states in the union , or parties , or numbers to be rounded , or shareholders in a manufacturing company .",
    "further , we define a real @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath2 and an integer vector @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the sum of the entries of @xmath5 in the first problem @xmath6 is the number of votes in the @xmath7-th state , @xmath4 the total number of votes and @xmath8 is the number of seats allocated to the state .",
    "let @xmath9 be the _ exact quota _ , that is the exact proportion of seats the @xmath7-th state may claim .",
    "in the second problem @xmath6 is the number of votes party @xmath7 obtains and @xmath8 is the number of seats allocated to party @xmath7 . let @xmath10 be the _ exact quota _ , that is the exact proportion of seats the @xmath7-th party may claim . in the third problem @xmath6 is the @xmath7-th given number and @xmath8 is the integer obtained by the rounding process applied to @xmath11 . here",
    "let @xmath12 . in the fourth problem",
    ", @xmath6 is the exact quota to which the @xmath7-th share holder is entitled to and @xmath8 the number of goods he receives .",
    "again we let @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to the following definitions .",
    "we are interested in sets of vectors whose entries are the exact quotas .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive integer ( e.g. number of seats ) and @xmath4 a positive real number ( e.g. number of valid votes ) .",
    "let @xmath14 this set contains all possible exact quotas among @xmath1 parties ( where in problems one and two we computed the exact quotas from a total of @xmath4 valid votes ) .",
    "note that we allow @xmath15 to contain real vectors .",
    "let @xmath16 be the subset of all integer vectors whose entries are non - negative and sum to @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is a lattice over the integers and represents the possible seat allocations .",
    "we illustrate the set @xmath18 for 3 parties and for @xmath19 in figure  1 .",
    "the set @xmath18 is a unilateral triangle in the space @xmath20 .",
    "its corners are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the black dots represent the exact quotas which are also possible seat distributions , that is exact quotas which lie in @xmath17 .",
    "the other points in the triangle correspond to all points in @xmath24 a valid apportionment method should map every point in the triangle to a seat allocation .",
    "it should be possible to draw a region around each black dot containing only this one black dot such that all exact quotas inside this region are mapped to the seat allocation to which the black dot is mapped .",
    "we believe a good apportionment should map a black dot to the seat allocation it describes .",
    "finally , the apportionment method might have a choice of which seat allocation to choose for the exact quotas which lie on the borders between two or more possible regions .",
    "an apportionment method is in principal a function which maps each possible vote distribution to a certain seat distribution . for a precise definition",
    "see p.  97",
    "balinski and young ( 1982 ) .",
    "we believe a good apportionment method should satisfy @xmath25    in most cases @xmath26 and @xmath0 are fixed .",
    "sometimes it might be necessary to emphasise the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath26 and @xmath0 , in which case @xmath28 denotes an apportionment method with given @xmath26 and @xmath0 .    while a mathematical definition of an apportionment method is sufficient to procure a meaningful apportionment , considerations of fairness dictate additional requirements . especially the order in which the parties are listed on a ballot should have no effect on the outcome of the election , that is the apportionment method should be symmetric .",
    "formally , let @xmath29 be a permutation of @xmath30 and let @xmath31 be the @xmath1-dimensional real vector @xmath32 .",
    "if we define @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is a subset of @xmath18 then define @xmath35    @xmath36symmetry of an apportioning method@xmath37 an apportionment method is _ symmetric _ , if for every permutation @xmath29 of @xmath38 we have @xmath39 .",
    "the outcome of a reasonable election method should depend only on the vectors of the exact quotas , that is if two different vote distributions yield the same exact quotas , the results should be the same .",
    "thus the apportionment method should be homogeneous .",
    "@xmath36homogeneity@xmath37 an apportionment method is _ homogeneous",
    "_ if for every real @xmath40 we have @xmath41    from now on all apportionment methods are symmetric and homogeneous .",
    "historically , many apportionment methods have been discussed in political assemblies and in the literature . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with two major classes : the divisor methods and the rounding methods .",
    "examples of the divisor methods are the methods of dhondt and sainte - lagu .",
    "the best known rounding method is the hare method , also called the method of the greatest remainders .",
    "a detailed description of these methods can be found in balinski and young ( 1982 ) , @xcite .",
    "here we give a very brief overview in order to establish the notation we use for the various methods .",
    "the _ divisor methods _ start with a strictly increasing sequence @xmath42 of non - negative real numbers , called the _ sequence of divisors_. we then have to divide the exact quotas @xmath43 for @xmath44 by the @xmath45 and define the @xmath46 matrix whose entry in row @xmath7 and column @xmath47 is @xmath48 we select the @xmath0 largest entries of this matrix and count the number @xmath49 of entries selected from the @xmath47-th column",
    ". then the party @xmath50 will get @xmath49 seats .",
    "linear divisor method _ is given by an arithmetically increasing sequence @xmath42 , that is @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fixed real numbers .",
    "as @xmath52 divides all terms of the sequence @xmath45 , we can omit @xmath52 by the homogeneity of the apportionment method , that is we can choose as sequence of divisors the sequence @xmath54    linear divisor methods have been treated extensively in the literature , see for example the literature review by heinrich et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , @xcite .",
    "the following sequences yield some well known linear divisor methods ( see @xcite ) :    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     all non - linear divisor methods are homogeneous .",
    "none is unbiased , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.3 ) , all are monotone .",
    "no non - linear divisor method satisfies both the upper and lower quota condition , however it never violates both simultaneously , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.4 and 6.5 ) .",
    "all non - linear divisor methods are house monotone , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cor .  4.3.1 , p. 117 ) .",
    "a method for computing the seat bias for a given apportionment method with a hurdle ( e.g. the 5% hurdle ) can be found in schwingenschlgl and pukelsheim ( 2006 ) , @xcite .",
    "another condition , a gentle majority condition , which is important for forming committees is discussed in pukelsheim ( 2006 ) , @xcite .",
    "it all started with an article in the newspaper  frankfurter allgemeine \" ( faz ) by dr .",
    "fromme which appeared on 14 october 1970 , pointing out the difficulties in determining the number of seats each party gets in the various committees pursuant to the 1970 elections in the federal republic of germany . in this election",
    ", the cdu / csu won 253 seats in parliament , the spd 237 and the fdp 28 , giving the spd / fdp coalition under chancellor helmut schmidt a majority of 265 seats ( including the members from berlin , who did not always have a vote but were counted in the assignment of seats in the committees ) .",
    "the dhondt system was used at that time to determine the number of parliamentary seats a given party won in general elections and to determine the distribution of committee seats .",
    "the difficulty that fromme pointed out was the paradoxon that - in a committee with a given number of 33 seats - the distribution according to dhondt was as follows : the cdu / csu was assigned 17 seats , spd 15 and the fdp l , thus giving the opposition party a majority .",
    "the same is also true e.g. for committees with @xmath55 members .",
    "this led to a discussion in parliament about changing the size of the committees because it was assumed that a method better than dhondt  would be hard to find \" .",
    "the political question which now arose was how to keep the majority and the mathematical question concerned which method to use .",
    "after giving the matter some thought , on 16 october 1970 the first author wrote to the administration of the bundestag suggesting the method of the largest remainders , which was subsequently adopted .",
    "almost seven years later , the cdu / fdp coalition in the state niedersachsen wanted to introduce legislation which would replace the dhondt - system by the hare - system .",
    "but the procedure left a couple of questions open .",
    "therefore , the committees of the state parliament which were discussing this piece of legislation invited the first author to a joint hearing on 23 march 1977 .",
    "the problem they discussed was the following : even with the hare method it can happen , that a coalition of parties with the majority of the seats in parliament does not get a majority of the seats in a committee .",
    "as an example to demonstrate that the hare method does not always satisfy the majority condition consider three parties competing for @xmath56 seats .",
    "they received @xmath57 and @xmath58 votes , respectively .",
    "the exact quotas they receive are @xmath59 then , according to the hare method , the seat distributions are @xmath60 and @xmath61 and so the first party does not have the majority of the seats , even though it received the majority of the votes .    in general , the hare method does not always satisfy the majority condition when @xmath0 is odd . if @xmath62 , then it is possible that a party obtains more than 50% of the votes but only receives @xmath47 seats . however , it is not possible that the party receives less than @xmath47 seats as is possible using the sainte - lagu method .",
    "further , it is also fairly easy to fix this situation as suggested by the first author .",
    "if a party obtains more than 50% of the votes then its quota is at least @xmath63 if one gives one of the remaining seats to this party , then the majority condition is fulfilled and it is still possible to redistribute the remaining seats such that each party gets at least the lower quota .",
    "dhondt s method favors the largest party so much so , that it can receive more than @xmath64 seats , where @xmath65 is the exact quota .",
    "this is because this method does not satisfy the upper quota condition .    as a result of this hearing ,",
    "the parliament in niedersachsen decided to hold the elections in niedersachsen according to the modified hare method , sometimes also called the hare - niemeyer procedure .",
    "however , in 1986 this method was again replaced by the dhondt method ( see @xcite ) .    from 1987",
    "onwards the hare - niemeyer method has also been used to for the seat allocations in the german bundestag until it was replaced in 2008 by the method of sainte - lagu ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we start with a general apportionment problem .",
    "suppose @xmath0 seats in parliament are to be distributed among parties @xmath66 .",
    "suppose further the parties received votes @xmath67 , represented by the vector @xmath68 , and let @xmath69 then the exact quotas are @xmath70 for @xmath71 and are exactly proportional to the number of votes party @xmath72 received .",
    "let @xmath27 be an apportionment method . in any apportionment method",
    "the transition from a vector @xmath73 with real entries to a vector @xmath74 with integer entries is bound to cause errors . on the one hand we can measure individual errors between @xmath75 and @xmath8 for @xmath71 and",
    "on the other hand there is a global error which comprises the individual errors .",
    "the following definition captures the properties of an error function which is decomposable into individual error functions .",
    "for @xmath71 let @xmath76 be functions such that the functions @xmath77 defined by @xmath78 are increasing .",
    "then the function @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 is called a _ decomposable error function_. the function @xmath81 is called the _ @xmath7th component of @xmath82_.",
    "further , we have @xmath83    decomposable error functions are also considered by gaffke and pukelsheim ( 2008 ) . for a given a decomposable error function @xmath82 the following theorem describes an algorithm called minimalsolution to determine the vector @xmath84 which minimizes the error function .",
    "hence for a given decomposable error function the theorem can be used to give rise to an apportionment method , namely the method which assigns each vector @xmath26 the vector @xmath85 which minimizes the error function , see also niemeyer and wolf ( 1984 ) . for divisor methods",

    "the method of sainte - lagu displays the instability paradox , that is small variations in the exact quotas can lead to large variations in the seat allocations . in the following two examples we see in the case where one party has",
    "the absolute majority of the votes , variations in the votes of the small parties can lead to significantly different seat allocations for the major party , without any changes in the votes of the major party .",
    "similar examples are also discussed by huntington ( 1928 ) , @xcite .",
    "for example , suppose 5 parties , 4 of which are very small , are competing in an election for @xmath209 seats .",
    "if the exact quotas given by the election are : @xmath210 then the seat allocation according to sainte - lagu is : @xmath211 whereas for a slightly different election result for the 5 parties , namely @xmath212 the seat allocation according to sainte - lagu is now : @xmath213 a change of the exact proportions by 0.165 seats enforces upon the large party a change of 4 seats . with hare",
    "s method in both cases the seat allocation would be @xmath214 .            even though party 1 won the absolute majority of the votes and was even allocated 26 seats by the exact quota , it looses 2 seats through the allocation method and therefore looses the absolute majority in the council .",
    "this example also displays the vote stability paradox .",
    "a slightly different election result could have been : @xmath218 then the seat allocation according to sainte - lagu is : @xmath219 note also a variation of 4 seats for the largest party between these two elections , even though in both cases the number of votes for the largest party was the same .",
    "the smaller parties dictated the outcome .",
    "apart from these examples , especially if a 5% hurdle is installed , the results of sainte - lagu and hare s procedure are almost always the same . for many federal elections",
    "sainte - lagu and hare differed in the seat allocation for the lower house ( bundestag ) only in two cases .",
    "the effect of the 5% hurdle is much larger than the change of apportionment method .",
    "however , if the 5% hurdle is abolished , the effect of the apportionment methods becomes much larger and is sometimes surprising , as the examples above point out .",
    "many people think there is a paradox in the method of the greatest remainder .",
    "especially , the new state paradox ( or `` parteizuwachsparadox '' ) : if a new party enters the apportionment method without changing any of the original votes of the other parties , then it can happen that the new party gets a certain number of seats but in addition , there is a redistribution of the other parties too . for instance , pukelsheim ( 1989 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  6 ) , gives the following example .",
    "consider parties @xmath221 and @xmath222 which each have attained @xmath223 and @xmath224 votes , respectively . if we distribute 37 seats among parties @xmath225 and @xmath226 , then according to the method of hare",
    ", they receive @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 seats , respectively . however , if we distribute @xmath230 seats among parties @xmath231 , and @xmath222 then they receive @xmath232 , @xmath228 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 seats , respectively .",
    "this seems to be a paradox as nothing has changed in the votes for the parties @xmath4 , @xmath34 , and @xmath226 .",
    "nevertheless , the party @xmath4 took one seat away from party @xmath226 .        in our opinion this behaviour does not deserve the label _ paradox _ as it is easily explained .",
    "the new party @xmath222 changes the exact quotas of all other parties and hence to obtain a fair apportionment of the seats as close to the exact quotas as possible , it is only fair that the seat allocation changes .",
    "the literature which label this behaviour a _",
    "paradox _ avoids the exact quotas like the bubonic plague .      the alabama paradox ( mandatszuwachsparadox ) appeared first in the united states .",
    "if one increases the number of seats from @xmath0 to @xmath240 then it may happen that a party receives more seats when @xmath0 seats are distributed than when @xmath240 are distributed . when computing all seat allocations for the american house of representatives using the @xmath163-rounding method for @xmath241 and the election results from 1880 and varying the possible seat numbers between 275 and 350 , the chief clark of the census office noticed that for @xmath242 and @xmath243 the number of representatives for alabama decreased from 8 to 7 , see balinski and young ( 1982 ) , ( * ?",
    "* table 5.1 ) .",
    "this can not happen in linear divisor methods .    since the hare method respects quotas it may happen that the exact quotas change by increasing the number of seats . as a result the number of seats a party receives might fall back to its lower quota . perhaps a good way to explain",
    "the situation is to think of the lower quotas as the guaranteed number of seats for each party and an additional seat as a bonus .",
    "the bonuses are then distributed according to greatest claim .",
    "they are not guaranteed .",
    "it can thus happen that with different number of seats the bonus seats are reallocated .",
    "consider for example three parties who received the following votes : @xmath244 @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "thus the total number of votes is @xmath247 the following table lists the exact quotas and the seat allocations using hare s and sainte - lagu s method for @xmath248 seats and @xmath249 seats .",
    "while at a superficial glance it seems unfair that the third party should have a seat less when more seats in total are allocated , a look at the exact quotas explains the situation . by the addition of one seat all exact quotas increase by the same percentage . the @xmath163-rounding method is closer to the ideal of being as close to exact proportion as possible .",
