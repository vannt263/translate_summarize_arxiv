    "the problem of the calculation of the two - photon decay rate from the hydrogen @xmath1 to the @xmath2 state was solved in 1931 by maria gppert ",
    "mayer  @xcite .",
    "essentially , gppert ",
    "mayer interpreted the two - photon decay in second - order time - dependent perturbation theory as a combined transition , from @xmath1 to a virtual @xmath3 state and then , in a second step , to the ground state .",
    "however , if one generalizes the problem trivially , namely to the @xmath4 two - photon decay , then one inevitably encounters calculational problems due to the presence of a resonant , intermediate , virtual @xmath5 state which leads to a quadratic singularity along the photon energy integration contour ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . formally , thus",
    ", in the limit of vanishing decay width of the intermediate resonant @xmath5 state , the total two - photon decay rate for @xmath4 would be infinitely large , provided we apply the formalism employed by gppert ",
    "mayer to the @xmath4 decay without any modifications or regularizations .",
    "of course , this problem has been realized , and three possible considerations have been used in order to circumvent it : ( i ) we may observe that the @xmath6 state can decay via one - photon , electric - dipole decay ( @xmath7 , see p.  266 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and we can therefore safely assume that the decay rate of @xmath6 will be given by the one - photon decay rate @xmath7 to an excellent approximation , and thus we may entirely neglect the two - photon contribution .",
    "( ii ) realizing that the virtual @xmath5 state causes problems , one can speculate about a possible exclusion of this state from the sum over the virtual , intermediate states in the propagators  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that this procedure is not gauge invariant and therefore can not lead to a consistent solution of the problem .",
    "( iii ) recently  @xcite , it has been pointed out that the divergences associated with the quadratic singularities do not occur if one interprets the two - photon decay rate as the imaginary part of the two - loop self - energy .",
    "this observation is in full analogy to the one - loop self - energy whose imaginary part gives the one - photon decay rate  @xcite . in the treatment used in refs .",
    "@xcite , one obtains expressions for the two - photon decay rate which are finite as the regulators ( infinitesimal @xmath8 terms in the propagator denominators ) approach zero at the end of the calculation , even if we investigate the problematic decay modes @xmath4 , @xmath9 etc . besides the analogy with the one - photon decay rate / one - photon self - energy relations , the treatment used in refs .",
    "@xcite has been made plausible by field - theoretical arguments and analogies to radiative corrections to cascade processes in photon emission in crossed electric - magnetic fields  @xcite and by analogies with the treatment of quadratic singularities in lamb - shift calculations for highly excited states  @xcite .    however , none of these treatments answer the simple question : what do we do about the expressions used by maria gppert ",
    "mayer , when generalized to the @xmath4 or @xmath9 decays in an obvious way ?",
    "what if we regularize the divergences due to virtual low - lying @xmath3 states by the most physical , most obvious regularization available , namely the total , physical decay rate of those intermediate , resonant , @xmath3 states that we insert into the propagator denominators ?",
    "( this approach has been discussed at various places in the literature , e.g. , p.  2447 of ref .",
    "@xcite or p.  4 of ref .",
    "how can we interpret the resulting expressions from this perhaps na@xmath0ve , but physically intuitive and plausible approach ?",
    "we attempt to answer these questions here . essentially , we find that the na@xmath0ve generalization of the expressions used by gppert ",
    "mayer to the @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays is perfectly reasonable , provided we subtract a lower - order term which is hidden in the expressions for the @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays , but absent in the @xmath10 decays .",
    "after the subtraction , the result obtained using the na@xmath0ve formalism is in perfect agreement with the result obtained for the two - photon decay rate from the imaginary part of the two - photon self - energy .",
    "we reemphasize that the result for the @xmath10 decay rate obtained by gppert ",
    "mayer does not require any additional subtractions or modifications .",
    "however , one should realize that in order to extract physically valid information from the na@xmath0ve expressions for the two - photon decay rates from highly excited states , like @xmath4 and/or @xmath9 etc .",
    ", one first has to subtract a lower - order term , whose physical interpretation is also discussed in the current paper .",
    "the general outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gen ] , we qualitatively explain the essence of the considerations needed to fully understand the removal of the lower - order terms which are present in the na@xmath0ve   expression for the two - photon decay rate and thereby anticipate a few considerations to be explained in greater detail in the following . in sec .  [ go ] , we then calculate the lower - order terms explicitly for the case of the @xmath11 decays ( @xmath12 ) , and explain their removal .",
    "conclusions are reserved for sec .",
    "we proceed by way of example .",

    ", we should first observe that the decay width ( even the one - photon width ) in the denominator of the na@xmath0ve  decay width is parametrically suppressed with respect to the energy differences of atomic states [ @xmath24 vs.  @xmath25 in units of the electron mass ] , and we can therefore apply the @xmath26-expansion to the evaluation of the expression . specifically , we evaluate in the limit @xmath27 , which is justified because the decay width @xmath28 is of higher order in the @xmath26-expansion than the energy difference @xmath29 . physically speaking ,",
    "the approximation is justified because the lifetime of a typical atomic level is long on the time scale of the oscillation period of radiation emitted in a typical atomic transition .",
    "we can thus expand the na@xmath0ve expression for the two - photon decay width of highly excited levels for small decay widths of the virtual states , keeping the physical value of the decay width at all stages of the calculation .    the first observation to be made",
    "is that physically , in the limit of a small decay width of the intermediate state @xmath30 , we can intuitively assume that the entire decay rate of the initial state will be due to one - photon decay from the initial state to the intermediate , resonant states ( i.e. , to exactly those virtual states with intermediate energy between the initial and the final state of the two - photon process ) .",
    "indeed , once the system has decayed to one of the intermediate state , it is `` stuck there '' in view of the small decay width ( long lifetime ) of that intermediate state .",
    "intuitively , we would thus expect that the na@xmath0ve  expression for the two - photon decay rate might contain , as a lower - order term in the @xmath26-expansion , the one - photon decay rate of the initial state .",
    "below , we show by an explicit calculation that this is indeed the case , and that the na@xmath0ve  expression for the two - photon decay rate simply contains the one - photon decay rate as a lower - order term .",
    "this slightly oversimplified statement is shown to hold provided one - photon cascade processes through intermediate , resonant states are possible for the chosen initial state under investigation , and provided we sum over all open cascade channels .",
    "( the first condition is not fulfilled , e.g. , for the @xmath10 decay , where no intermediate , resonant states are available and there are no lower - order terms to subtract . )    in terms of the @xmath26-expansion , the lower - order term is calculated to be of the order of order @xmath31 as opposed to @xmath32 ( the latter would be the expected order - of - magnitude for the two - photon decay rate ) .",
    "the remaining term from the na@xmath0ve   two - photon decay , i.e. the expression left over after the subtraction of the term of order @xmath31 , then is the coherent two - photon decay rate , and this left - over term is equivalent to the prediction from qed theory .    a final word on eq .",
    "is in order .",
    "it has been questioned in the literature ( e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whether one should use the total or a differential decay rate for the propagator denominators in this case .",
    "the most physical and most intuitive prescription is to use the total decay rate of every single intermediate state in order to regularize the quadratic singularity .",
    "indeed , we find here that a very clear interpretation of the lower - order terms can be given provided the total decay width of the intermediate , virtual states is used as a regulator . because the total decay rate can be approximated very well by the _",
    "one_-photon decay rate for all the virtual states , we use the total _",
    "one_-photon decay rate @xmath28 as a regulator in the denominators of eq .  .",
    "one would have to change this prescription only if the virtual @xmath1 state were present as a virtual states because it is metastable and decays primarily via two - photon decay ( @xmath33 in the nonrelativistic dipole approximation ) , but the @xmath1 states is not present as a virtual state in our calculations .",
    "first , we recall the mathematical mechanism by which the quadratic singularities are regularized according to refs .  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the two - photon decay rates @xmath68 are of order @xmath32 , as they should be .",
    "we also observe that the qed treatment  @xcite thus eliminates the lower - order terms right from the start .",
    "the generalization to , e.g. , an initial @xmath69 state is straightforward , but one has to take into account the @xmath70 cascades . we will refrain from discussing the generalization further , as the principle of the calculation should be sufficiently addressed by the example case of the @xmath44 state",
    "the central result of this paper is contained in eq .  . for the initial @xmath44 state",
    ", it is shown that the coherent two - photon contribution to the decay rate , as given by a qed treatment , is obtained from the na@xmath0ve  expression for the two - photon decay width , given in eq .",
    ", after the subtraction of lower - order terms whose sum over all open channels is exactly equal to the total one - photon decay width of the initial state .",
    "note , in particular , that the qed treatment eliminates the lower - order terms right from the start  @xcite .",
    "this result could be anticipated ( see sec .  [ gen ] ) based on a physical consideration : the @xmath26-expansion of the decay rate implies an expansion for small decay widths of the intermediate , resonant states ; this expansion , in turn , physically implies a long lifetime for the intermediate , resonant states ( on the time scale given by the oscillation period of radiation emitted in a typical atomic transition ) .",
    "this means that in a first approximation , the virtual resonant states `` trap '' the electrons after a single photon has been emitted .",
    "this again implies that the lower - order term contained in the na@xmath0ve expression for the two - photon decay rate should be equal to the one - photon decay rate of the initial state , provided we sum over all open channels , and provided all possible one - photon decays of the initial state can participate in such two - photon cascades . the term left over after the subtraction of the lower - order terms is the two - photon correction to the decay rate , and it is of order @xmath32 in units of the electron mass , as it should be .",
    "these considerations allow us to give a very clear physical interpretation of the lower - order terms which are to be expected in the treatment of a two - photon decay process with virtual resonant states : because the addition of the probability amplitudes in the na@xmath0ve  treatment does not lead to a clear separation of the sequential two - photon emission via the intermediate , resonant states from the coherent two - photon contribution to the decay rate , lower - order terms have to be expected , and in view of the above arguments , these have to be exactly equal to the one - photon decay rate of the initial state .",
    "let us recall what a treatment of the total decay rate would imply for the decay width of , say , the @xmath44 state , if we were to add the _",
    "expression for the two - photon decay rate to the well - established result for the one - photon decay rate  @xcite of that state . in this case , because of the presence of the lower - order term in the two - photon decay width , we would double - count the one - photon decay rate of the @xmath44 state and obtain a result for the total decay width which would be twice as large as the established value .",
    "this procedure can not be consistent , and a subtraction is definitely required , as outlined here .",
    "note that spurious lower - order terms are a recurrent theme in a number of qed calculations .",
    "e.g. , in the first , non - relativistic treatment of the bound - electron self - energy  @xcite , the result was found to diverge only logarithmically with the energy of the virtual photon , but only after a more severe linear divergence was identified as a low - energy part of the mass renormalization associated with the low - photon - energy contribution to the lamb shift and subtracted ( see also refs .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors had to subtract several spurious lower - order terms in order to obtain the @xmath71 correction to the lamb shift from the two - coulomb - vertex forward scattering amplitude [ see especially eqs .",
    "( 36 ) and ( 53 ) of ref .",
    "eventually , these spurious terms could be shown to cancel against compensating terms from the one - coulomb - vertex term , but if the authors had considered only the two - vertex contribution to the lamb shift , then they would have had to carry out a subtraction , and this is indeed the spirit in which most modern lamb shift calculations are done [ see also the remarks after eq .",

    "@xcite , where several lower - order subtraction terms are identified and subtracted , albeit in a different context ] . while the result reported here could have been found immediately after the initial treatment due to gppert ",
    "mayer  @xcite , concepts developed later in the context of the theory of renormalization have inspired us to look for possible subtraction terms .",
    "note that the two - photon decay rate can naturally be interpreted as the imaginary part of the two - loop self - energy  @xcite and therefore also constitutes an `` energy shift , '' albeit an `` imaginary one , '' or an `` imaginary part thereof . '' the additional subtraction term found here can thus be interpreted as an additional renormalization of the imaginary part of the bound - state energy which becomes necessary if the na@xmath0ve method of regularization is used for the resonant intermediate states .    summarizing the results of our investigations ,",
    "we conclude that physically sensible lower - order terms are obtained from the na@xmath0ve  expressions for the two - photon decay rates when the propagator denominators of the intermediate , resonant states are regularized by assigning to them the _ total _ decay widths of those virtual state .",
    "this is in agreement with physical intuition and reassuring . a final remark on gauge invariance : for an infinitesimal @xmath8 in the propagator denominators  @xcite , all expressions are gauge invariant with respect to length and velocity gauges , as shown in ref .",
    "for finite , small decay rates acting as regulators , gauge invariance , strictly speaking , does not hold .",
    "however , the gauge - noninvariance is shifted to higher - order terms @xmath72 , which are not relevant from a phenomenological point of view , and thus , with the correct prescription for the subtraction of lower - order terms , the result for the two - photon correction to the decay rate can indeed be obtained from the na@xmath0ve  expression regularized using the decay widths of the virtual , resonant , intermediate states .",
