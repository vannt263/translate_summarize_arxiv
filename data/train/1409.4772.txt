    "knowledge of the faint end of the galaxy lf is essential for understanding many aspects of the high redshift universe including the extent to which faint galaxies contribute to the total cosmic sfr density , to the reionization of the universe , and to gamma ray burst rates .",
    "the deepest _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images are `` only '' capable of reaching absolute magnitudes of @xmath8 , at @xmath0 @xcite . however , several phenomena require knowledge of the uv lf to much fainter limits .",
    "for example , models that are able to simultaneously reionize the universe with galaxies by @xmath9 and match other constrains such as the thomson optical depth inferred from the cosmic microwave background must extrapolate the uv lf to @xmath10 ( for nominal assumptions regarding the escape fraction of ionizing photons , the topology of the igm , etc . ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ may not reach such faint limits @xcite , suggesting that direct detection of the faint galaxies thought to be key for reionization will prove elusive for decades .    here , we present a new technique capable of probing the rest - frame uv properties of very faint galaxies across cosmic time . using star formation histories ( sfhs ) of local group ( lg ) dwarf galaxies measured from the analysis of deep color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , we are able to synthesize the uv luminosity evolution of faint galaxies to high redshifts",
    ". with this approach we can estimate the uv lf to limiting magnitudes of @xmath1 at @xmath0 and @xmath11 at @xmath3 .",
    "the primary data used in this analysis are the sfhs of 37 lg dwarf galaxies that were measured by modeling their _ hst_/wfpc2-based resolved star cmds @xcite .",
    "uv luminosities as a function of redshift are then constructed by coupling the sfhs to the flexible stellar population synthesis code ( fsps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once various sources of incompleteness are included , we fit a schechter function @xcite to a combination of these reconstructed lg lfs and more luminous literature values . here",
    ", we describe this procedure in detail , including the assumptions and uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "our sample consists of 37 dwarfs galaxies located within the lg ( @xmath1250% of the known lg dwarf population ) .",
    "sample galaxies have low present - day metallicities ( @xmath13 ) , stellar masses ( @xmath14 ) , and dust content ( a@xmath150.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "our sample contains systems of all morphological types and environments ( milky way and m31 satellites , isolated systems ) found in the lg , including ` ultra - faint ' dwarfs .",
    "overall , our sample is broadly representative of the entire lg dwarf galaxy population .",
    "sfhs of these galaxies are presented in @xcite .",
    "they were measured by modeling cmds from archival _ hst_/wfpc2 imaging using the maximum likelihood cmd fitting package ` match ` @xcite .",
    "an example sfh derived from cmd fitting is shown in figure [ fig : sfhexample ] .",
    "full details of ` match ` and application to the lg sample can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "important for this study is the fact that the sfh time resolution is , at best , @xmath16% of the lookback age .",
    "thus , the highest well - resolved redshift is @xmath0 .",
    "this is a fairly stringent limit owing to lingering uncertainties in stellar evolution and the subtle changes in isochrones at old ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "following the procedure detailed in @xcite , we use fsps to translate each sfh into the galex rest - frame fuv flux as a function of time . as a first step , we correct for aperture effects inherent to the observations .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "field - of - view typically covers a modest fraction of most galaxies ( @xmath17% ) , and thus _",
    "hst_-based sfhs are not necessarily globally representative .",
    "we derive an approximate aperture correction by comparing the synthesized @xmath18 v - band luminosity with the observed v - band luminosity from @xcite .",
    "we multiply each sfh by the ratio of these quantities and use the resulting re - scaled sfhs and fsps to compute the fuv flux profile . when synthesizing the uv fluxes with fsps , we assume a constant metallicity of @xmath19 and no internal dust extinction .",
    "the latter assumption is reasonable as the uv spectral slopes of faint high redshift galaxies are consistent with a dust - free spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for lookback times older than a few gyr ,",
    "the native time bins of the sfhs are larger than the timescale of uv emission ( @xmath20myr ) .",
    "we must therefore explore the effects of intra - bin star formation variation on the synthesized uv lfs .",
    "we quantify the amplitude of this effect by considering many permutations of stochastic intra - bin bursts .",
    "two representative examples are shown in figure [ fig : sfhexample ] . in both examples , 80% of the total stellar mass",
    "is formed in the burst phase ( mass is , of course , conserved relative to the fiducial sfh ) , and the bursts have the same contrast amplitude of 20 relative to the ` off ' burst star formation rate .",
    "the two models differ in burst timescales of 20 and 200 myr ( red and blue lines , respectively ) .",
    "the 20 myr model is patterned after sfhs from fully cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the 200 myr bursts illustrate fairly dramatic changes in the uv flux profile , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we assume these two burst models for all galaxies in our sample , and plot the resulting @xmath21 uv lfs in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sfhexample ] . for the purposes of this exploratory study",
    ", we largely mitigate the effects of intra - bin bursts by placing our uv lfs in 3-magnitude wide magnitude bins .",
    "this is also desirable as our sample only contains 37 galaxies , yet spans a wide range in uv luminosities .",
    "we must also consider both random and systematic uncertainties in the native sfhs themselves .",
    "random uncertainties are due to the finite number of stars in a cmd , and generally scale in amplitude with the sparsity of the observed cmd .",
    "synthesizing the random uncertainties for all galaxies via a monte carlo analysis is computationally prohibitive .",
    "instead , we analyze representative sfhs to place bounds on the random error range . from this exercise",
    "we conservatively adopt a fractional uncertainty of 50% on the sfh of each galaxy .",
    "systematic uncertainties are due to inherent shortcomings with the stellar models used to measure the sfhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their amplitude generally scales inversely as a function of photometric depth , i.e. , deeper cmds provide more secure leverage on the full sfh of a galaxy relative to a shallower cmd because they probe more age sensitive features and older main sequence turnoffs ( mstos ) . correctly synthesizing these systematic uncertainties",
    "is beyond the scope of this current exercise but , in principle , can be be done in future analyses .",
    "finally , we use a @xcite imf for our analysis , the same as adopted by high redshift studies . however , a variable imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would systematically affect the shape of the uv lf , but modeling this effect is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "first , we account for known lg dwarfs that are not included in our sample .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are no such calculations for the entire lg . therefore , we use predictions made by the elvis n - body simulation of lg - like environments @xcite to estimate the number of expected low - mass galaxies located within the lg at @xmath18 . as shown by the solid black line in the top panel of figure [ fig : weisz_uvlf ] , nearly an order of magnitude more faint systems",
    "are expected to exist than are currently known . in this correction process , we propagate the fractional poisson errors per magnitude bin from our intrinsic @xmath18 v - band lf to the uv lfs at all redshifts .",
    "we illustrate the effect of the various volume corrections on the @xmath21 uv lf in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : weisz_uvlf ] . clearly , accounting for missing galaxies",
    "is the dominant correction factor .",
    "the normalization of the lg lf need not be the same as the high redshift field galaxy lf , both because of differential evolution of the lg with respect to the field and because of sample variance due to large scale structure in both samples . we address this by including separate normalization terms when fitting schechter functions to the lg and literature lfs . specifically , we model the combination of our lg data and literature data with a schechter function of the form    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , m@xmath32 , and @xmath4 follow the standard definitions of normalization , characteristic magnitude , and faint end power - law slope . at each redshift",
    "we fit the literature data and reconstructed lg lfs simultaneously and require m@xmath32 and @xmath4 to be the same for both schechter functions ; only the normalizations are allowed to differ between the two datasets .",
    "we then write the log - likelihood function for the combined datasets as    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are gaussian likelihood functions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the uv luminosity values and uncertainties per magnitude bin from the literature and lg , respectively , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the schechter functions for the literature and lg data .",

    "[ sec : sfhs ] only statistical uncertainties are included for the lg data .",
    "our reconstructed uv lfs are listed in table [ tab : uvlfdata ] .",
    "there are several important features in this figure .",
    "first , the the lg dwarf data allow an estimate of the uv lf to extremely faint limits . at @xmath26",
    "the fossil record extends the uv lf fainter by a factor of @xmath48 compared to the lensed observations of @xcite and @xmath49 fainter than other existing data .",
    "similar gains are seen at all redshifts , and are particularly notable at @xmath22 , where the limits of the lg data extend down to a remarkable @xmath2 . synthesizing uv fluxes for @xmath50 becomes challenging because of the need to include uncertain contributions from ancient uv bright populations ( e.g. , post - agb and blue horizontal branch stars ) .    a second notable feature is the shape of the lg data .",
    "although we have made several relatively strong assumptions to construct these uv lfs , they exhibit a shape that is in good agreement with direct observations of the uv lf at higher luminosities .",
    "perhaps most importantly , there is no evidence of a turnover in the uv lfs down to extremely faint limits  the data are consistent with a single power - law slope at faint luminosities over a dynamic range of @xmath51 .    a key advantage of adding in the lg data is increased accuracy and precision in the recovery of schechter parameters compared to using high luminosity data alone .",
    "as is clear from figure [ fig : uvlfs ] , the direct measurements @xcite of the uv lf generally only probe the bright end and the knee of the lf , which yields a significant amount of uncertainty in and degeneracy between the schechter parameters .    our resulting schechter parameters are shown in figure [ fig : params ] , along with literature values based only on the direct high redshift measurements . in general , we find broad consistency with literature values of @xmath4 at each redshift , although we highlight the significant uncertainties ( @xmath120.5 dex ) in most literature values compared to this work . when comparing the other schechter parameters , the agreement between our results and the literature is less impressive , especially at @xmath52 . in this regime",
    "the direct measurements probe a limited dynamic range that results in large uncertainties and covariances between the schechter parameters .",
    "deeper rest - frame uv data at @xmath53 would be valuable in clarifying these apparent discrepancies .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : params ]",
    "we show the ratio of @xmath42 and @xmath54 , the schechter function normalizations for the lg and high redshift lfs , respectively .",
    "their ratio encodes information regarding the relative behavior of the lg and high redshift lf .",
    "we would expect this ratio to be constant with redshift if the lg population was representative of the high redshift field population at each redshift .",
    "if instead the lg dwarfs have sfhs that systematically differ from the ( higher luminosity ) high redshift field population , then this ratio should change with redshift .",
    "this ratio might also evolve if the present lg population represents only a small fraction of the high redshift progenitor lg population .",
    "the uncertainties on this ratio are large and are broadly consistent with constant .",
    "future improvements both in the high redshift data and the number of lg sfhs could significantly reduce these errors and would be valuable for placing the lg in a broader cosmological context .",
    "there are several important assumptions and uncertainties in this analysis .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sfhexample ] , the intra - bin sfh variation introduces modest uncertainties in the reconstructed uv lfs .",
    "this can be properly marginalized over in a more comprehensive analysis .",
    "a more important concern are systematic errors , which are typically dominant in the sfhs measured from cmds that do not include the ancient mstos .",
    "we have assumed that the lg dwarfs are dust - free and have a single metallicity at higher redshift .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given current observations , and it is worth noting that adding a constant amount of extinction to all the lg galaxies would only affect @xmath42 ; in order to change @xmath4 one would require a systematic variation of @xmath55 with dwarf galaxy luminosity .",
    "other limitations in the present study include the corrections required to estimate lfs from the 37 lg dwarfs .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : weisz_uvlf ] , the incompleteness corrections at the faintest luminosities are a factor of @xmath56 and rely on @xmath57body dark matter simulations ( e.g. , an assumed shm relation ) . however , the corrections at brighter luminosities are quite small .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to luminosities where the lg data are believed to be highly complete , ( m@xmath58 at @xmath18 ) , we recover consistent , but less precise , schechter parameters at most redshifts ( open symbols in figure [ fig : params ] ) .    finally , we expect that the present day lg population represents only a fraction of the progenitor galaxy population owing to the disruption of dwarf galaxies over time ( i.e. , mostly accretion onto the mw / m31 , but potentially dwarf - dwarf mergers as well ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this disruption process is weakly dependent on the galaxy luminosity then our main results will be unaffected .",
    "we might expect a weak dependence because the correlation between dwarf galaxy light and total gravitational mass is very weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is the latter quantity that more directly controls the efficiency of tidal stripping and merging",
    ". it should be possible to estimate these effects directly with current @xmath57body simulations .",
    "these limitations and uncertainties can be addressed and reduced with upcoming facilities .",
    "wide - field capabilities of the lsst will discover and better characterize the lg dwarf population , reducing the magnitude of volume and aperture corrections , and minimizing sample variance considerations @xcite .",
    "_ jwst _ and wfirst will provide unprecedented depth to better characterize the brighter end of the high redshift lf and reach the oldest mstos of the dwarf galaxy populations in and beyond the lg .    properly addressing these limitations",
    "will ensure that the reconstructed lfs of nearby dwarfs will play an important role in characterizing the faint galaxy population at high redshifts .",
    "such systems are believed to play a critical part in reionization of the universe , but are too faint for direct detection in the foreseeable future . with our novel technique , we have demonstrated the existence of a large number of faint systems at high - redshifts .",
    "their uv lfs show no hint of a turnover down to very faint limits , and suggest that current extrapolations of the faint - end slope to higher redshifts are justified .",
