    "this path will be induced in the final graph , and connections to other graph parts would be only possible via the two middle vertices .",
    "the combinatorial claim is that finally exactly one of the two middle vertices should be in any local adjacency basis of the graph instance that we construct . in the following ,",
    "these two middle vertices are called literal vertices , as whether or not they belong to the local adjacency generator determines whether or not the literal is set to true .",
    "due to this intention , we will call one of the two middle vertices positive literal vertex and the other one negative literal vertex .",
    "we introduce one clause gadget per clause .",
    "this is a graph of order nine depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - locadjdim clausegadget ] .",
    "we claim that we need at least two vertices from each of these clause gadgets in any local adjacency basis .",
    "two are only sufficient if some of the literal vertex neighbors from variable gadgets are in the local adjacency basis .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - locadjdim clausegadget ] by considering the vertices coloured black . also , we need at least two vertices in any local adjacency basis that are from the `` innermost '' six vertices in each gadget .",
    "we assume that the three outermost vertices of each gadget are numbered like @xmath554 , @xmath555 , @xmath556 .      *",
    "introduce an induced @xmath553 , called @xmath559 for each variable @xmath560 . *",
    "introduce a subgraph @xmath561 of order nine for each clause @xmath562 . *",
    "assume that there is some order @xmath563 on @xmath83 , which transfers to the set @xmath564 of variables occurring in clause @xmath565 .",
    "hence , we can refer to the @xmath107 vertex in @xmath564 . *",
    "an edge interconnects the positive literal vertex of @xmath559 with the outermost vertex @xmath566 of @xmath561 if and only if the literal @xmath94 occurs in @xmath565 , @xmath94 is the @xmath107 variable in @xmath564 and @xmath566 is the vertex number @xmath567 . *",
    "an edge interconnects the negative literal vertex of @xmath559 with the outermost vertex @xmath566 of @xmath561 if and only if the literal @xmath568 occurs in @xmath565 , @xmath94 is the @xmath107 variable in @xmath564 and @xmath566 is the vertex number @xmath567 .",
    "* there are no further edges in the graph @xmath13 .",
    "the overall claim is that there is a local adjacency basis of size at most ( and also exactly ) @xmath571 if and only if the given 3-sat formula @xmath557 was satisfiable .",
    "our previous reasoning already explained that the local adjacency dimension of the union of the variable and clause gadget graphs is at least @xmath571 .",
    "furthermore , we claim that for any local adjacency basis that does not contain any vertex of some path @xmath559 , there exists another local adjacency basis that contains a middle vertex from @xmath559 . having a local adjacency basis @xmath572 for @xmath13 with two vertices from each clause gadget and one middle vertex from each variable gadget , we obtain a satisfying assignment of the formula @xmath557 by setting @xmath94 to true if and only if the positive literal of @xmath559 belongs to @xmath572 . this way , @xmath94 is set to false if and only if the negative literal of @xmath559 belongs to @xmath572 .",
    "conversely , any satisfying assignment of @xmath557 yields a local adjacency basis for @xmath13 by first putting the positive literal of @xmath559 into the basis if @xmath94 is set to true by the assignment and by then putting the negative literal of @xmath559 into the basis if @xmath94 is set to false .",
    "moreover , as the assignment was assumed to be satisfying , each clause @xmath565 is satisfied , so that at least one of the literal vertices neighboring some outermost vertices of @xmath561 was put into the basis .",
    "now , two innermost vertices from @xmath561 could be put into the basis ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - locadjdim clausegadget ] ) to finally produce a local adjacency basis of size @xmath536 as required .",
    "to show np - hardness for planar instances , we recall lichtenstein s construction for planar vertex cover ; see  @xcite : we only have to introduce cycles of length @xmath573 instead of paths @xmath553 in our reduction ; this enables `` individual '' vertices in the local adjacency generator that correspond to occurrences of literals in the clauses . also , the cycle structure of the variables ( in lichtenstein s framework ) can be implemented by appropriate interconnections of the variable cycle gadgets . as @xmath574",
