    "a fundamental prediction of the hierarchical clustering paradigm in a collisionless dark matter dominated universe is that the average mass profile of dark halos must primarily depend on mass , if the density perturbation spectrum is nearly a power law .",
    "the single parameter surface brightness profile , @xmath6 , was proposed by devaucouleurs ( 1948 ) to describe elliptical galaxies , but it was later found also to be quite an accurate description of isolated n - body collapse simulations , both with and without dissipation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath7 `` law '' has no simple analytic form to describe the volume distribution ( @xcite ) , motivating hernquist ( 1990 ) to propose the function @xmath8 as a more tractable alternative , which in projection is usefully close to the @xmath7 function .    in cosmological halo formation simulations , where external tides and continuing infall are included ,",
    "the central density profile is found to remain approximately @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , although there is growing evidence that the central slope is somewhat steeper ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , beginning near the virialization radius the density profile is found to fall somewhat less steeply than in isolated collapses , leading navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 and 1997 , hereafter nfw ) to advocate @xmath10 as an empirical description of the halo density profiles . in a series of exhaustive n - body simulations",
    "the relation between the scale radius , @xmath11 , of the halo and its mass has been studied to yield an empirical understanding of its value ( @xcite ) .",
    "the principal result of interest here is that the scale radius , @xmath11 , is measured in the simulations to be about 20% of the `` virial radius '' for the @xmath12 dark halos appropriate to rich clusters .",
    "this result has only a weak dependence on either the power spectrum , or the world model parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for simulations normalized to the observed cluster abundance .",
    "halos of much lower mass , say the @xmath15 characteristic of individual galaxies , are generally much more centrally concentrated than clusters , with quite a strong dependence on the cosmological details .    in the next section we fit the galaxy number density profile , @xmath16 , to the nfw function , then present evidence that this profile ( specifically for galaxies selected in gunn @xmath17 , which as a red pass band is relatively insensitive to the current star formation rate ) accurately traces the average cluster mass profile , @xmath18 . in particular we compare the derived surface mass profile with the surface galaxy number profile .",
    "our analysis is independent of the light - traces - mass assumption and allows for a range of velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "we have previously shown that this type of analysis works to recover the same mass profile from two vastly different subsamples of the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted scale radius of the nfw model is compared to the predicted scale radius . in section 3 ,",
    "we use the scaling from velocity dispersion to radius to predict the form of the profile for each cluster in turn and compare it to the available data .",
    "the results are briefly discussed in the final section .",
    "we use @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all our calculations , although the results are not very sensitive to these choices .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) cluster survey ( @xcite ) obtained @xmath21 redshifts of gunn @xmath17 selected galaxies in the fields of 16 high luminosity x - ray clusters at @xmath22 .",
    "this is a relatively homogeneous sample of clusters that are guaranteed to be at least partially virialized on the basis of their x - ray emission .",
    "the virial mass - to - light ratios of these clusters were found to be identical , within their measurement errors of @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 14 clusters that are `` non - binary '' are combined in normalized co - ordinates to make an ensemble cluster .",
    "this diminishes substructure and asphericity to a level where the galaxies can be treated as if in a spherical distribution which is consistent with dynamical equilibrium ( @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies of all colors above a k - corrected gunn @xmath17 absolute magnitude of @xmath24 are included in the average .      to combine the clusters the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg )",
    "is used as the nominal center of each cluster on the sky following our earlier procedures ( carlberg , yee & ellingson 1997 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy velocities are normalized to @xmath25 , the rms velocity dispersion of the clusters about the cluster mean .",
    "the projected radii are normalized to an empirically determined 200 , the radius where the mean interior overdensity is @xmath26 . to derive 200  from the observational virial radius , @xmath27 ( which is largely fixed by the outer boundary of the sample ) , we assume that @xmath28 .",
    "this gives @xmath29 which is completely independent of the observational virial radius .",
    "usually the extrapolation in radius is a modest 25% , so the precise mass profile assumed makes little difference to the result ( @xcite ) .    the average projected galaxy number density profile , @xmath30 , is fit with the projection of the volume density function , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is fixed at either @xmath33 ( nfw ) or @xmath34 ( hernquist ) . the results for @xmath33 are shown in figure  [ fig : surf ] as the solid line .",
    "the dashed lines are described below .",
    "both the @xmath33 and @xmath34 forms are statistically acceptable fits by the @xmath35 test .",
    "we will only consider the @xmath33 form for the rest of this paper .",
    "the fitted scale radius is @xmath36 with a 95% confidence range of @xmath37 from the @xmath35 distribution .",
    "there is no dynamical necessity for @xmath16 to be directly proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the relationship between the two is derived from the projected velocity dispersion , @xmath38 .",
    "the dynamical mass profile , @xmath39 , which is the volume integral of @xmath18 , is inferred from the jeans equation ( , @xcite ) , @xmath40 , \\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] where the velocity anisotropy parameter , @xmath41 .",
    "n - body simulations for a variety of cosmologies show that the dependence of @xmath42 has a nearly universal radial variation ( @xcite ) which we somewhat arbitrarily model as , @xmath43 which takes on a maximum value of @xmath44 at @xmath45 , in 200units .",
    "we demonstrate below that the volume _ mass _ density is not very sensitive to the details of the velocity modeling , provided the model is an acceptable statistical description of the data .",
    "we use values of 0.3 and 0.5 for the parameter @xmath44 which roughly bracket the range of @xmath42 seen in the simulations .",
    "we model the radial velocity dispersion as , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the two parameters adjusted to fit the observed @xmath49 .",
    "we include here a new central data point at 0.05200 .",
    "the rest of the data are as in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 $ ] parameters are externally fixed to allow us to vary the shape of the curve . in figure",
    "[ fig : sig ] we display results where @xmath50 $ ] are @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] to give the two extremes of the functional form .",
    "the @xmath51 $ ] form was used in @xcite and @xmath52 $ ] gives a dispersion which drops to zero at the center .",
    "the intermediate values @xmath53 $ ] are adopted for reasons made clear below .",
    "both the @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] forms have reduced @xmath35 near unity . the @xmath51 $ ] form is about 4% probable , although this is critically dependent on the @xmath54 point , the concern being that the old central galaxies may be a distinct , low velocity dispersion , cluster population .",
    "we show the results of the mass analysis in figure  [ fig : dol ] .",
    "the quantity plotted is @xmath55 normalized to @xmath56 , computed from the same data .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 is only weakly constrained inside @xmath57 and the assumption of virialization likely fails outside @xmath58 . within",
    "this radial range @xmath55 varies less than about 30% of its mean value .",
    "it should be noted that for most purposes the more relevant quantity is @xmath39 , the volume integral of @xmath18 , which is substantially more slowly varying .",
    "the offset of @xmath55 below unity indicates that mass and light are similarly distributed but that the virial mass has a scale error .",
    "a wide range of positive intermediate values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 gives nearly constant @xmath61 everywhere .",
    "we display the @xmath62 , @xmath63 case , which is one of many intermediate sets of parameters which leads to substantial cancellation of the opposite behaviour of the two extreme @xmath64 models in the derived @xmath39 .    with the dynamically",
    "derived @xmath55 in hand we can use it to model the galaxy number profile , @xmath16 , assuming the _ mass _ profile is described by the nfw profile . this procedure measures @xmath65 , the scale radius of the _ mass _ distribution .",
    "we take @xmath55 to be equal to the endpoint of the range for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the results for our three velocity dispersion functions and the two values of @xmath44 are shown in figure  [ fig : surf ] as the dashed lines .",
    "the resulting @xmath65 values range from @xmath68 ( @xmath50=[0,1]$ ] ) to @xmath69 ( @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "this expands the 95% confidence range of @xmath65 over @xmath70 slightly , to @xmath71 .",
    "we conclude that galaxies selected from their red light brightness , , a passband well to the red of the 4000  break to minimize sensitivity to star formation ( and not necessarily galaxies red in color , @xcite ) , accurately trace the mass profile of the cluster .",
    "that is , @xmath16 is directly proportional to @xmath18 , within the statistical limits of our measurements .",
    "the nfw profile can be tested for its application to the clusters as individuals .",
    "the 200  for each cluster is derived from the observed velocity dispersion , equation  [ eq : r200 ] .",
    "the nfw scale radius is set at our best fit value , @xmath36 .",
    "the fits are restricted to the region inside @xmath58 , which is expected to be virialized for @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting @xmath35 per degree of freedom ( there being 10 - 16 degrees of freedom ) are given in table  [ tab : chi ] .",
    "the cluster ms0906 + 11 , which we observed , is excluded because it was not possible to measure a reliable velocity dispersion , which we believe is likely because there is another nearby clusters in the redshift direction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath35 values of 14 of the 15 clusters are 1.1 or less , indicating that the nfw function with a fixed scale radius is a statistically acceptable fit to the density profile .",
    "the a2390 cluster has @xmath73 per degree of freedom which indicates that the fit is about 15% probable .",
    "a2390 is the cluster with the most data .",
    "if we had about a third less data for this cluster , the fit would have been entirely acceptable .",
    "however , as the amount of cluster data increases beyond about 100 galaxies , the substructure within the cluster ( @xcite ) becomes more clearly detected . by extension , if we had obtained more than 200 or so galaxies within any cluster , the substructure would have become clearly resolved .",
    "this sampling strategy was part of the initial layout of the cnoc observations .",
    "we have established that the dynamical mass profile , @xmath18 , is proportional to the galaxy number density profile , @xmath16 , over the range of radii where the argument is secure .",
    "we further make the modest assumption that @xmath16 continues to trace the mass , within the errors , at larger radii .",
    "consequently we conclude that the nfw function accurately describes the mass field .",
    "the measured scale radius is @xmath74 with a 95% confidence range of @xmath5 .",
    "this relatively large confidence range is a result of the relatively small change in profile slope at the characteristic scale for the nfw profile .",
    "the hernquist function has much smaller errors when used in same fitting procedure .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath2 and a cdm spectral normalization of @xmath75 are 0.20 for an open model ( nearly identical to the @xmath76 , @xmath77 value of 0.19 ) and 0.26 for a flat low density model ( @xcite ) , are remarkably precise predictions of the observed value .",
    "overall it appears that a very good understanding of the evolution of the mass field in clusters is emerging .",
    "the value of @xmath13 determined from dynamical observations of clusters ( @xcite ) predicts a slow change in the abundance of clusters with redshift , which is in accord with the directly observed value ( @xcite ) .",
    "previously we found that clusters as individuals have masses inside 200  which are accurately predicted from their velocity dispersions ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we have shown that the predicted scale radius and the universal nfw profile provide a statistically acceptable description of the virialized region , @xmath78 , of 14 of the 16 clusters selected for the cnoc observational program , with the failures likely being the result of large substructures .",
    "the combination of successful predictions of galaxy cluster mass profiles and their cosmological number density evolution is a strong argument for the model of cluster formation in an effectively cold , collisionless , dark matter dominated universe .",
    "these results could be substantially tightened , in the first instance , through redshift determinations for more cluster galaxies in the outskirts of this sample .",
    "the referee , cedric lacey , provided valuable comments which substantially improved the presentation of this paper .",
    "we thank cfht for the technical support which made these observations feasible .",
    "nserc and the nrc provided financial support .",
