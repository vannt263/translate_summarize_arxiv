    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is a most promising proposal for a non - perturbative definition of string theory .",
    "thus , this correspondence should also have important consequences for early universe cosmology .",
    "in fact , over the years there have been several proposals which address the meaning of cosmological singularities in the dual field theory @xcite .",
    "the general idea is the following : consider an asymptotically ads space - time which is contracting towards a curvature singularity .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary , this may correspond to a dual conformal field theory which lives on the boundary which is in a nontrivial unstable state @xcite or which has a time dependent coupling @xcite which becomes small when the bulk singularity is reached . while the bulk theory can not be used to evolve further in time",
    ", it may be possible to track the time evolution in the dual field theory in a controlled fashion .",
    "it is then not unreasonable to assume that the dual field theory admits a continuation in time beyond the time @xmath0 when the bulk singularity occurs .",
    "there are several motivations for this investigation .",
    "one of the motivations comes from cosmology .",
    "although the inflationary scenario @xcite is the current paradigm of early universe cosmology and has been quite successful phenomenologically , it faces conceptual challenges . in particular , a robust embedding into string theory has proven to be elusive ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "at the same time , it has been realized that there are alternative cosmological scenarios which are at the moment also in agreement with cosmological data .",
    "one of these is the `` matter bounce '' scenario ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , a bouncing scenario which begins with a matter - dominated phase of contraction during which the scales which we observe today with cosmological experiments exit the hubble radius .",
    "it was shown in @xcite the if fluctuations begin in their bunch - davies vacuum at past infinity , that the growth of the fluctuations on super - hubble scales converts the vacuum spectrum into a scale - invariant one for scales exiting the hubble radius during the matter phase of contraction . adding a small cosmological constant ( of magnitude similar to the one observed today ) leads to a small red tilt in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum of curvature fluctuations is indeed scale - invariant with a small red tilt ( see @xcite for the most recent data ) .    in the context of effective field theory and einstein gravity ,",
    "it is difficult to obtain a non - singular bouncing cosmology .",
    "one either needs to postulate that matter violates the `` null energy condition '' ( nec ) during the bounce , or one needs to go beyond einstein gravity .",
    "examples of the former are adding ghost condensate matter @xcite or galileon matter @xcite , an example of the latter is horava - lifshitz gravity in the presence of non - vanishing spatial curvature @xcite . however , it is doubtful whether any of these constructions actually can emerge from an ultraviolet complete theory such as string theory .",
    "hence , it would be very interesting to investigate if the ads / cft correspondence leads to a consistent bouncing cosmology .    regardless of the above motivation , it is clearly interesting to invstigate what happens to classical spacelike singularities in a complete theory of gravity .",
    "in particular , does the holographic correspondence predict a time evolution beyond this `` singularity '' ? despite a lot of effort , it is not clear whether any of the ads / cft models which contain _ true singularities _ in the bulk admit a smooth time evolution in the dual theory . in the original model proposed in @xcite which was based on earlier work of @xcite",
    ", there were some technical problems which indicated that the time evolution past the singularity was not under control @xcite , mainly due to the back - reaction of the fluctuations on the background space - time .",
    "there have been attempts to overcome these obstacles @xcite , but the final verdict is still out .    in the works of @xcite a bulk dilaton field @xmath1 had a time dependent ( or a null coordinate dependent ) boundary condition so that @xmath2 becomes small at some time ( or null time ) , while einstein frame curvatures become large in the bulk , signifying a singularity .",
    "when the singularity is null , the dual theory appears to predict a smooth time evolution , and because of the absence of particle production one expects that the spacetime is smooth in the future .",
    "however for backgrounds with space - like singularities , as in @xcite there is no clear conclusion . even though the background supergravity solution is time symmetric , the issue relates to the effect of fluctuations . in the boundary field theory",
    ", the question becomes that of particle production .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that in the case when the boundary theory coupling hits a zero , the time evolution of each individual momentum mode is in fact singular .",
    "however it was not clear what happens when one considers the full field theory . in a regulated version of the theory where the boundary coupling becomes small but does not hit a zero , time evolution is well defined .",
    "however , the energy due to particle production at times after the crunch would be large , and the spacetime will not bounce back to pure ads even at very late times . on general gounds , one might expect that a black brane is formed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we turn to a different aspect of the kind of backgrounds with spacelike singularities studied in @xcite as a result of a time dependent boundary condition for the bulk dilaton .",
    "the goal of our study is to include cosmological perturbations in this picture .",
    "this is important for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is important to study whether the background is stable against the addition of fluctuations .",
    "secondly , most of the data which we would like to explain in cosmology concerns fluctuations ( inhomogeneities in the distribution of galaxies and anisotropies in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ) .",
    "we will not explore further the important question whether there are apparently singular ads cosmologies which lead to a bounce to a relatively empty space .",
    "rather , we will study models of the same type as @xcite which have kasner singularitites . however we will keep @xmath2 finite ( but small ) at all times , rather than going to zero , by putting in a cutoff in time , @xmath3 . more specifically , instead of the exact kasner behavior near the singularity e^(t ) = |t|^[1 - 1 ] we will use e^(t ) = |t|^(|t| - ) + ^(- |t| ) [ 1 - 2 ] we do not know of exact solutions with such a cutoff dilaton : we _ assume _ that these can be constructed . in the presence of such a finite cutoff , the boundary gauge theory is well defined : our aim to study some aspects of this . in some sense ,",
    "the spirit of our investigation is similar to that of @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where signatures of a past kasner singularities in the dual field theory were studied .",
    "we want to determine how the _ spectrum _ of fluctuations evolves as the system passes through the `` singularity '' .",
    "this question is independent of nature of the late time space - time so long as there is a region of normal spacetime near the horizon , which is where the fluctuations are measured .",
    "this question is particularly interesting if any of these models reliably predict a bounce since in this case connections with bouncing cosmologies studied by many cosmologists can be made .",
    "there are classes of scenarios where , starting from vacuum perturbations at early times in the contracting phase , a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations is generated before the bounce .",
    "this occurs both in matter bounce scenarios @xcite for scales which exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase of contraction , and also in ekpyrotic models ( in the presence of entropy fluctuations ) @xcite . to obtain a connection with observations , the spectrum after the bounce needs to be determined .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the form of the spectrum after the bounce can depend on details of the bounce , although in many toy models one finds that on large scales the spectrum is preserved ( see e.g. the analysis of @xcite ) .",
    "a result concerning the transfer of fluctuations in an ultraviolet complete theory is thus highly desired .",
    "however , this question is also of interest for the particular model which is analyzed in this paper , which in all likelihood produces a black brane .    as is clear from previous work , the gauge theory is in a highly excited state as one approaches the region of weak t hooft coupling , possibly in a coherent state .",
    "in such a situation , we expect that we can learn a lot from the _ classical limit _ of the yang - mills theory .",
    "we therefore study the time evolution of small fluctuations around the background across the region of weak coupling .",
    "such small fluctuations are related , by the ads / cft correspondence to bulk fluctuations .",
    "the kind of fluctuations we are interested in are those which are given by correlation functions on a fixed radial slice on ads , close enough to the boundary .",
    "as we discussed , the space time in the future might contain black holes ( branes ) .",
    "however so long as the space - time near the boundary is smooth and normal , we can use the ads / cft dictionary to translate boundary fluctuations to bulk fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we take a preliminary step towards computing the transfer of cosmological fluctuations from before the beginnig to after the end of the high curvature bulk regime .",
    "we begin with a given spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the contracting phase of the bulk , while the bulk is still weakly coupled . at the time when",
    "the bulk becomes strongly coupled ( and , correspondingly , the boundary conformal field theory becomes weakly coupled ) we map the fluctuations onto fluctuations of the gauge fields in the boundary theory .",
    "we then evolve the fluctuations to the future in the weakly coupled region on the boundary . in our classical approximation",
    ", it is now straightforward to find the fate of these fluctuations at late times .",
    "the third step of our analysis is the reconstruction of bulk fluctuations from the boundary data to the future of the bulk singularity .",
    "note that we are interested in fluctuations on scales of current cosmological interest .",
    "these scales are infrared modes from the point of view of the physics which we are considering . specifically , the wavelength of the modes we are interested in is larger than the hubble radius at the times between @xmath4 and @xmath5 when we evolve the fluctuations on the boundary .",
    "our main result is that the momentum dependence of classical fluctuations for momenta much smaller than the cutoff ( @xmath6 ) does not change after crossing the weak t hooft coupling region , while their amplitudes change by @xmath7 factors .",
    "this means that the spectrum of fluctuations of the dilaton field near the boundary also have this behavior .",
    "in particular , if we start out with a nearly scale invariant spectrum with a red tilt ( as is the case for models of matter bounce ) , the spectrum right after the `` bounce '' will remain the same .",
    "while this result is shown for the bulk dilaton , we conjecture that the result we obtain will directly apply to the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum , the reason being that a test scalar field in a cosmological background obeys the same equation of motion as that of the amplitude of a particular polarization state of gravitational waves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the proposed generalization of the ads / cft correspondence to a time - dependent background @xcite .",
    "section iii consider a bulk scalar field and its dual in the boundary gauge theory .",
    "as it turns out , the time - dependence of the background scalar field induces a time - dependence of the mass of the gauge field . in section",
    "iv we study the evolution of the gauge field given the time - dependence of the coupling constants induced by the non - trivial scalar field in the bulk .",
    "since we are interested in eventually computing linear fluctuations in the bulk , we will focus on linear perturbations of the boundary field .",
    "this leads to a dramatic simplification of the analysis .",
    "we can work in fourier space .",
    "each fourier mode obeys an ordinary differential equation which is analogous to the equation which cosmological fluctuations in a time - dependent background obey in the context of standard general relativistic perturbation theory .",
    "hence , we can use the accumulated knowledge about the evolution of cosmological fluctuations in time - dependent backgrounds to solve for the evolution of the linear boundary gauge field perturbations through the time point @xmath8 where the bulk theory becomes singular .",
    "since the boundary theory is weakly coupled near the bulk singularity , the computations done in the context of the boundary theory remain under controle . at large positive times ( when the bulk theory becomes weakly coupled ) we then reconstruct the bulk scalar field using boundary - to - bulk propagators .",
    "this is discussed in section v where we also extract the power spectrum of the scalar field fluctuations at late times and relate it to the initial spectrum before the bulk singularity .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in the final section .",
    "the original maldacena conjecture is a duality between a type iib string theory on @xmath9 and a conformal field theory , a supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) @xmath10 large @xmath11 @xmath12 gauge theory , living on the boundary of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the two dimensionless quantities on the bulk side are @xmath14 , where @xmath15 stands for the ads radius and @xmath16 is the string length and the string coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "these are related to the two dimensionless quantities in the sym theory , the yang - mills coupling @xmath18 and the rank of the gauge group @xmath11 by = 4g_ym^2 n  g_s = g_ym^2 [ 2 - 1 ] the string coupling @xmath17 is of course given by the bulk dilaton field @xmath19 g_s = exp [ 2 - 2 ] there are two particularly noteworthy aspects of this correspondence .",
    "firstly , it relates a gravitational theory ( the bulk theory ) to a non - gravitational field theory on the boundary . from this point of view",
    ", the challenge of quantizing gravity suddenly takes on a completely new view .",
    "secondly , the duality is a strong coupling - weak coupling duality .",
    "the bulk dilaton provides both a measure of the couplings in the bulk and in the boundary .",
    "however , it is precisely when the bulk theory becomes strongly coupled that the boundary theory becomes weakly coupled . in particular we can consider @xmath20 so that bulk quantum effects are small , but @xmath21 so that the boundary theory is weakly coupled",
    "- this would correspond to bulk curvature scales of the order of string scale , signifiying that stringy effects become important in the bulk .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. by having @xmath22 for some fixed large @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests an interesting avenue to address the question of resolution of cosmological singularities .",
    "one possible way to do this is to consider a time dependent boundary condition of the bulk dilaton @xcite . by the standard ads / cft correspondence the dual field theory living on the boundary now has a time dependent coupling .",
    "a cosmological singularity corresponds to a divergence of the gravitational coupling and thus to a region where conventional approaches to quantizing gravity will fail .",
    "however , by the ads / cft correspondence the bulk theory is dual to a non - gravitational theory on the boundary , and the bulk singularity corresponds to a point in time when the boundary theory becomes weakly coupled .",
    "thus , the usual principles of field theory quantization should be applicable , and one has to deal with a weakly coupled field theory which , however , is time dependent .",
    "the first step is to consider the low energy limit of the bulk type ii string theory , namely type ii supergravity , and to focus on the bosonic sector of this theory .",
    "the second step is to allow for a time dependence in the bulk fields .",
    "the bulk fields involve the ten - dimensional metric , the dilaton @xmath19 and a five form @xmath23 .",
    "the ansatz for such solutions is given by a non - trivial metric of the form ds^2 = [ dz^2 + _ ( x^)dx^dx^ ] + r^2 d_5 ^ 2 [ 2 - 2 ] where @xmath24 is the standard metric on a unit 5-sphere .",
    "the surface @xmath25 is the boundary of the space - time .",
    "note that the metric on a constant @xmath26 slice is a function of the coordinates @xmath27 only .",

    "@xmath9 is of course a special case of a space - time described by the metric ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the metric @xmath34 , the minkowski metric , and the dilaton is constant .",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath26 runs from @xmath35 at the boundary to @xmath36 at the poincar horizons .",
    "time - dependent deformations of this background were considered in @xcite . specifically , we shall consider a background of the form @xcite obtained by introducing a time - dependent dilaton background and adjusting the metric of @xmath30 such that the einstein equation ( [ ee ] ) and the klein - gordon equation ( [ kge ] ) remain satisfied .",
    "we will mainly deal with a solution where the the boundary metric looks like that of a friedmann universe @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the cosmic time and @xmath39 the scale factor .",
    "the dilaton and scale factor were taken to be @xmath40 this corresponds to an early contracting phase leading to a `` big crunch '' singularity at @xmath41 followed by an expanding cosmology . in conformal time @xmath42 , the four dimensional part of the metric is @xmath43,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the dilaton is given by =  .",
    "[ sol_bg2 ] if the singularity can be resolved by mapping the dynamics to the boundary , we will have a stringy realization of a bouncing scenario , though one would not expect a perfect bounce .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we do not know yet if this indeed happens .",
    "the dilaton profile ( [ sol_bg2 ] ) leads to a diverging string coupling at early and late times : this would seem to require incorporation of bulk quantum corrections .",
    "however it turns out that one can obtain solutions which have bounded values of the dilaton at all times , and whose behavior near the `` singularity '' is identical to the above .",
    "such a solution is given by the metric @xcite ds^2 = [ 2 - 4 ] and a dilaton e^(t ) = g_s |(t / r)|^ .",
    "[ 2 - 5 ] near @xmath44 the dilaton profile goes over to that in ( [ sol_bg2 ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) , whose four dimensional part is a frw metric with constant negative curvature does not , however , become ( [ metric33 ] ) as @xmath45 .",
    "the difference between the two , however , become increasingly unimportant as @xmath45 where the stress tensor is dominated by the time derivative of the dilaton rather than the spatial curvature .",
    "a sketch of the space - time we are considering is given in fig .",
    "1 . the vertical axis at @xmath35 is time , the horizontal axis at @xmath8 represents the @xmath46 radial coordinate .",
    "the poincar horizons are at 45 degrees . while we will consider the solution ( [ sol_bg2 ] ) and ( [ metric33 ] )",
    "it is useful to think of this as embbeded in the solution ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) with a bounded dilaton .",
    "then at early times the yang mills coupling is @xmath47 and we will always consider @xmath48 with @xmath49 . thus the early time evolution is governed by the bulk supergravity equations .",
    "the time @xmath5 is defined as the time when the t hooft coupling of the boundary theory becomes @xmath7 , i.e. t_b/ r ~(g_s n)^-1/ . [ 2 - 6 ] thus , in the region @xmath50 and @xmath51 the bulk gravity theory is weakly coupled .",
    "for @xmath52 the bulk curvatures grow large and stringy effects becomes important , while the boundary field theory is weakly coupled , although in the presence of a time dependent coupling .",
    "note that the solutions considered above have a non - trivial boundary value of the dilaton and a boundary metric which is conformal to flat space .",
    "however there are no subleading normalizable pieces of these bulk fields . from the dual field theory point of view",
    ", it thus appears that we have non - trivial time dependent sources , but a trivial response .",
    "this indicates that such cosmologies correspond to some non - trivial initial states .",
    "however the nature of this state in terms of the gauge theory variables is not known .",
    "there is another feature of these solutions which deserves mention .",
    "the singularity at @xmath8 extends from the boundary to the bifurcation point of the poincare horizon at @xmath53 .",
    "this means that there is in fact a singularity at any finite poincare time which is infinitely far from the boundary .",
    "presumably this feature has something to do with the nature of the initial state .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , this bifurcation point singularity can be resolved by lifting the solution to one higher dimension and embedding the solution in a higher dimensional soliton solution .    in the following sections we are interested in evolving spectator massless bulk scalar field ( which will be in fact taken to be the dilaton itself ) perturbations from the past weakly coupled bulk region to the future",
    "weakly coupled bulk region by mapping the state onto the boundary at time @xmath54 , evolving on the boundary to positive times , and using boundary - to - bulk reconstruction techniques to recover fluctuations in the bulk .",
    "to begin with , we consider a test scalar field of mass @xmath55 living in the bulk space - time ( in the following section we will take this test scalar field to be the dilaton itself ) .",
    "its action takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the metric of the five - dimensional deformed @xmath46 space - time ds_5 ^ 2 = [ dz^2 + _ ( x^)dx^dx^ ] [ 3 - 1 ] with the four dimensional part @xmath58 given by ( [ metric3 ] ) . varying the action with respect to the scalar field",
    "yields the following equation of motion @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hubble parameter , and a dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath38 .",
    "since we are interested in the spectrum of fluctuations in the three spatially flat coordinates @xmath61 , we first of all extract the @xmath61 dependence by expanding in fourier modes .",
    "the resulting differential equation is a partial differential equation in @xmath38 and @xmath26 , and we make a separation of variables ansatz to separate the @xmath38 and @xmath26 dependence . more specifically , we write ( t , z , x^i ) = ( t ) z(z ) x(x^i ) , where the @xmath62 are the spatial fourier modes , i.e. solutions of ^2 x + k^2 x = 0 , with solutions which are positive or negative frequency oscillations in the three vector @xmath63 , where the rescaled temporal field ( t ) a(t ) ( t ) ( with @xmath42 being conformal time defined via @xmath64 obeys the equation [ teq ] ^ + ( ^2 a^2 + k^2 - ) = 0 , ( a prime denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath42 ) and the radial function @xmath65 obeys the equation z _ , zz - z_,z + ( ^2 - ) z = 0 .",
    "the separation constant @xmath66 plays the role of a temporal frequency",
    ". the solutions of the radial equation are bessel functions z(z ) = c_j z^2 j_(z ) + c_y z^2 y _ ( z ) , with =    the temporal equation ( [ teq ] ) takes on the familiar form of the coefficient function of a comoving fourier mode of a massive scalar field ( mass given by @xmath67 ) in an expanding background space - time which undegoes cosmological squeezing ( the final term on the left hand side of the equation ) . in the case @xmath68 it is also the equation of motion which gravitational waves in an expanding space obey @xcite . in particular , in the case of infrared modes for which @xmath69 is negligible , then close to the singularity the mass term is negligible and the squeezing term dominates . in this paper we will , however , not be evolving the fluctuations in the bulk until the singularity , but only to the point in time when the bulk theory ceases to be weakly coupled .",
    "then , we will map them onto the boundary and evolve them with the boundary equations near the bulk singularity .",
    "our main result does not depend on the initial fluctuation spectrum . as a concrete example , however , we could e.g. take the initial spectrum to be scale invariant for modes whose wavelength is larger than the hubble radius . during the phase of contraction the hubble radius is decreasing in comoving",
    "coordinates ( see fig .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in several models of `` bounce '' cosmology ( e.g. matter bounce of @xcite or ekpyrotic @xcite scenarios ) an initial vacuum spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite ) on sub - hubble scales gets converted to a scale - invariant one once the scales exit the hubble radius and undergo squeezing .",
    "we will thus take the initial power spectrum p(k ) k^3 |()(k)|^2 on super - hubble scales to have index @xmath70 ( where we are using the convention for the index used in the cosmology community for gravitational waves , namely @xmath71 ) .",
    "after discussing the bulk - to - boundary correspondence for the fluctuations we will determine the initial spectrum of perturbations of the boundary gauge fields which are induced by the inhomogeneities of the bulk field discussed above .",
    "for a pure @xmath46 bulk , the dual boundary theory is a @xmath72 sym theory . according to the @xmath73 correspondence , fields in the bulk",
    "are related to operators in the boundary theory .",
    "for example , the bulk metric @xmath74 is dual to the boundary energy - momentum tensor @xmath75 . in this paper",
    "we are interested in scalar field fluctuations in the bulk and their boundary evolution .",
    "specifically , we will take this scalar field @xmath19 to be the dilaton @xmath19 . in this case",
    ", the bulk scalar field is dual to the trace of the square of the field strength tensor . for an exact @xmath46 bulk ,",
    "the boundary action is simply [ s_ym0 ] s_ym = -d^4 y [ f_f^ ] , with g_ym^2 = e^ = g_s .",
    "here , we denote the boundary coordinates by @xmath76 .",
    "we use a generalized @xmath73 correspondence according to which the time - dependent dilaton in the bulk leads to a time - dependent gauge coupling of the boundary theory , i.e. ( [ s_ym0 ] ) is generalized to be [ s_ym ] s_ym = -d^4 y e^- ( t ) tr[f_f^ ] .",
    "the bulk solutions we are interested in have , in addition , a boundary metric which is non - trivial and time dependent .",
    "however since this metric is conformally flat , and the boundary theory is the four dimensional sym theory , the conformal factor decouples .",
    "what was said so far applies to an unperturbed theory . in the presence of perturbations",
    "the correspondence becomes more involved @xcite .",
    "each supergravity perturbation has two modes - one normalizable and the other not .",
    "the normalizable mode determines the expectation value of the boundary operator , the non - normalizable mode enters as the coupling of the operator in the boundary theory .",
    "we are interested in evolving linearized bulk fluctuations .",
    "this means we will turn on normalizable bulk modes .",
    "hence , we will be evolving the linear fluctuations in the gauge field @xmath77 on the boundary .",
    "the initial condiitions for the gauge field fluctuations on the boundary are set by the dilaton perturbations via the linearized version of the correspondence [ operator ] ( y ) [ f^2(y ) ] , where the normalizable dilaton fluctuation behaves in the standard fashion as ( z , y ) z^4 ( y ) [ a-1 ] as one approaches the boundary @xmath35 .",
    "the effects of linear dilaton fluctuations on the evolution of the gauge field fluctuations would be a second order effect in the amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "hence , at linear level in perturbation theory there is no such coupling and the only effect of the dilaton on the gauge field fluctuations is via the dilaton - dependence of the gauge coupling constant at background level .    given a spectrum of dilaton fluctuations at early times in the bulk , we will evolve them in the bulk until bulk perturbation theory breaks down at time @xmath78 . at that point",
    ", we compute the boundary values of the dilaton fluctuations and use them to determine the initial values of the gauge field fluctuations @xmath79 at that time .",
    "as we have mentioned , the dilaton field evolves as a function of cosmic time and initially takes a large value , and thus the yang mills coupling is also very large initially which implies that the boundary theory is strongly coupled in the far past .",
    "( it is useful to think in terms of the solutions ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) with bounded dilaton profiles ) . at these early times",
    ", the dynamics of the whole space - time can be studied making use of the bulk theory since the gravity sector is weakly coupled . as the universe contracts ,",
    "the value of @xmath80 decreases and the corresponding t hooft coupling of the field theory becomes @xmath7 at the time @xmath78 given by ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) .",
    "this is the time where the gravity approximation begins to fail .    as the bulk space",
    "further contracts , the boundary theory becomes weakly coupled as @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the bulk singularity point is reached . while it may appear that the boundary gauge theory is now free , as shown in @xcite , each momentum mode of the gauge theory displays a singular behavior .",
    "we therefore work with the modified dilaton profile ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) with @xmath84 so that this is a genuine bulk solution for @xmath85 .",
    "we will make a gauge choice a_0 = 0 , and also impose an additional constraint ^i a_i = 0 .",
    "the gauss law constraint is then automatically solved @xcite .",
    "the form of the action ( [ s_ym ] ) suggests a field redefinition ( for an analysis in terms of the original variables see appendix a ) a__e^-/2 a _ .",
    "this has two effects .",
    "the first is that it introduces a `` mass '' term for the redefined field . with a dilaton which depends only on time ,",
    "the effective mass square is given by @xmath86 the second effect is to bring in a factor of @xmath87 in front of the cubic interaction term and a factor of @xmath80 in front of the quartic interaction .",
    "this might suggest that as @xmath45 the nonlinear terms become small and can be ignored .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite this is incorrect . if one substitutes a general solution of the linearized equations of motion ( see below ) into the action one finds that the fields @xmath88 blow up as @xmath45 in such a way that the original field @xmath89 becomes @xmath7",
    "therefore , for arbitrary amplitudes the nonlinear terms can not be ignored .",
    "however we are interested in the time evolution of _ small _ fluctuations of the gauge field .",

    "in fact , we are intersted in following modes which early in the contracting phase have a wavelength smaller than the hubble radius and then exit the hubble radius at some point in time ( i.e. the hubble radius decreases such that the wavelength becomes larger ) .",

    ", the nature of the entire spacetime at positive times in the presence of these flutuations is not known and might contain a black brane in the bulk .",
    "we will , however , assume that there is a region near the boundary where the curvatures are small enough to enable us to use the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "in partcular we will assume that the bulk dilaton field at a point @xmath161 for small enough @xmath26 can be reconstructed from the dual boundary operator @xmath162 using a bulk boundary map of the form [ recon ] ( z , , t ) = dt d^3x k( , t | z , , t ) o( , t ) , where the kernel @xmath163 ( where @xmath164 are boundary coordinates and @xmath165 are the bulk coordinates ) is non - vanishing only for points within the @xmath46 causal wedge ( see fig .",
    "3 ) of compact support . due to the translation symmetry of the background ,",
    "we assume that the kernel @xmath166 depends only on the relative spatial separation @xmath167 .",
    "the idea of the reconstruction is depicted in figure 3 : we consider a wedge sticking into the bulk with base on the boundary .",
    "the wedge is centered at the time @xmath5 we need the boundary points of the wedge to all have time coordinate @xmath168 - otherwise the wedge will intersect the singular part of the bulk .",
    "this will limit the distance from the boundary to which we can reconstruct the bulk .        as we will see",
    ", we will in fact never need the explicit form of the boundary - to - bulk propagator in order to extract the spectrum of bulk dilaton fluctuations .",
    "the only property of this propagator which will be used is that it is non - vanishing only within the wedge shown in figure 3 . in particular as @xmath169 ,",
    "one recovers the correspondence ( [ a-1 ] ) .",
    "now we turn to the extraction of the power spectrum of the bulk field @xmath19 in the future of the reconstruction time @xmath5 .",
    "our starting point is equation ( [ recon ] ) which gives the bulk field in terms of the known boundary data . to extract the spectrum of fluctuations , we need to take the fourier transform of @xmath170 in the spatial hyperplane perpendicular to the @xmath46 radial coordinate axis @xmath26 : ( z , k , t ) = v^-1/2 d^3x ( z , x , t ) e^i k x , where the tilde symbol indicates the fourier transform .",
    "we now insert the reconstruction formula ( [ recon ] ) into the above . introducing the new coordinates &",

    "we are interested in values of @xmath144 which are small compared to both the inverse hubble radius and the @xmath46 radius . assuming that the propagator @xmath166 has support within the @xmath46 causal wedge ( see figure 3 ) of the bulk point , then for all values of the boundary coordinate @xmath171 for which @xmath166 does not vanish we have @xmath172 , and one has approximately [ almost2 ] ( z , k , t ) ds d^3y k(y , s | z , t ) o(k , t+s ) .",
    "the @xmath144- dependence of the bulk fluctuation is therefore completely determined by the @xmath144- dependence of the expectation value of the operator @xmath162 , which - in our framework - is in turn determined by the @xmath144- dependence of the gauge field fluctuations @xmath173 .",
    "we have seen that the spectral index of the latter does not change when we cross the `` singularity '' .",
    "the time integral in ( [ almost2 ] ) has an extent which is roughly of the same order as @xmath26 .",
    "therefore for @xmath26 small enough , the @xmath144 dependence of @xmath174 is basically given by the @xmath144-dependence of the gauge field fluctuations .",
    "hence , we find that the spectral index of fluctuations close enough to the boundary does not change when matching across the `` singular '' region ( singular in quotation marks because we have cut off the actual singularity ) . on the other hand , the amplitude of the spectrum changes by a factor @xmath175 given by = ( ) ^2 _ g . in particular , the bulk spectrum on a small @xmath26 slice",
    "is chosen to be scale invariant , i.e. @xmath176 the spectrum continues to be scale invariant .",
    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of linearized test field fluctuations in a deformed @xmath73 cosmology . the deformed @xmath46 background which is the basis of our study",
    "is obtained by introducing a nontrivial time - dependence for the dilaton and choosing the metric such that the bulk supergravity equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "the background begins with a contracting phase which approaches a bulk singularity at time @xmath8 .",
    "as the singularity is approached , the background becomes highly curved . at the time @xmath177 the gravitational theory becomes strongly coupled .",
    "however , the dual gauge theory which lives on the boundary becomes weakly coupled . after the singularity ,",
    "the bulk expands , and after some time @xmath178 the bulk theory once again becomes weakly coupled .",
    "our goal is to compare the spectrum of fluctuations of the bulk field in the far past ( @xmath179 ) and in the far future ( @xmath180 ) . specifically , we consider fluctuations in the dilaton field . we evolve the fluctuations in the bulk until @xmath54 ,",
    "map them onto the boundary at that time , infer the spectrum of the boundary gauge field fluctuations at this time and then evolve the boundary gauge field fluctuations forward in time , past the singularity , until the time @xmath181 . at that time",
    ", we reconstruct the bulk dilaton field using boundary - to - bulk propagators which are nonvanishing only in a  @xmath46 causal wedge wedge , and compute the spectrum of the fluctuations .    since the boundary fluctuations blow up at the time @xmath8 in spite of the fact that the boundary theory is weakly coupled , we need to smooth out the singularity .",
    "we , therefore , modify the dilaton between @xmath182 , where @xmath3 is a cutoff scale and then match the boundary fluctuations in a standard fashion .",
    "our main result is that the spectral index of the dilaton fluctuations near the boundary is the same in the far past and the far future .",
    "while we do not have the tools to map out the future space - time , we believe that our result will have important implications for pre big - bang scenarios of cosmology .",
    "the kinetic energy term of the gauge fields on the boundary is not of canonical form .",
    "this was the motivation for rescaling the gauge field .",
    "the rescaling factor , however , diverges at @xmath8 .",
    "hence , we might worry that the divergence of the rescaled gauge field @xmath183 which we found is a result of this rescaling , and that the evolution in terms of the original variables @xmath77 might be better behaved .",
    "in fact , the equation of motion for the fluctuation of the original variable is ( - _ t^2 + _ t + _ i ^i ) a_j = 0 , which has fourier mode solutions a_j(kt ) = t^_g ( c_+ j__g(kt ) + c_- y__g(kt ) ) .",
    "the first mode goes to zero at @xmath8 whereas the second mode approaches a finite value .",
    "hence , there is indeed no divergence in the solutions .",
    "however , the first mode has a branch cut at @xmath8 .",
    "hence , matching conditions are still required in order to evolve the solutions from negative to positive values of @xmath42 .    in the spirit of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence it would be nice not to have to impose any cutoffs in the matching calculation .",
    "this could have been expected since the gauge theory becomes free at @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , there is a matching of the two modes at @xmath8 for which there is no particle production at all ( in terms of the rescaled variables this matching corresponds to having the derivative of @xmath184 match to its inverse between @xmath185 and @xmath186 ) .",
    "this matching , however , does not correspond to what is done in standard quantum mechanics problems and it misses the particle production which is expected on physical grounds .    hence , it appears that a matching prescription is needed .",
    "an explicit calculation shows if the matching prescription is taken to be the same as the one we used for the rescaled variables , that then the matching calculation calculation in terms of the original variables leads to the same result as that obtained using the rescaled field .",

    "<S> we can map the bulk evolution of the scalar field onto the evolution of the boundary gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of linearized fluctuations is well defined in the boundary theory as long as the coupling remains finite , so that we can extend the boundary perturbations to late times after the singularity . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the spacetime in the future of the singularity has a weakly coupled region near the boundary , we reconstruct the bulk fluctuations after the singularity crossing making use of generic properties of boundary - to - bulk propagators . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extract the spectrum of the fluctuations at late times given some initial spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectral index is unchanged , but the amplitude increases due to the squeezing of the fluctuations during the course of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation can teach us important lessons on how the spectrum of cosmological perturbations passes through a bounce which is singular from the bulk point of view but which is resolved using an ultraviolet complete theory of quantum gravity . </S>"
