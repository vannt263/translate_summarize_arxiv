    "cells not satisfying one of the above conditions or subjected to a higher background noise , might see their snr falling below an estimation threshold point snr @xmath151the point at which the cell is no longer able to estimate the stimulus direction . indeed , this estimation process is essentially nonlinear  owing to the nonlinear relationship between the mechanostimulus and the spatial signals registered by the cell  and thereby suffers from a low snr threshold effect induced by the appearance of outlying peaks in the log - likelihood function  @xcite . here , an mle is considered , but any other type of statistical estimation that exhibits such a nonlinear threshold effect constitutes a serious fundamental limit in the cell s ability to effectively perform directional mechanosensing at a low snr  @xcite .",

    "indeed , we showed the existence of a critical prestress which entirely depends on the free energy barrier this energy barrier is fixed for one particular type of msc .",
    "therefore , for one particular type of cell , if the prestress value for the lipid bilayer happens to be close to the critical prestress , then the mechanosensitive process benefits from a much higher signal - to - noise ratio . this could be tested experimentally with various different types of cells , having notably different natures of their lipid bilayers and , hence , different prestress values .",
    "this set of cells would have to be subjected to the same mechanostimulus of decreasing magnitude under the same environmental conditions .",
    "finally , we uncovered the existence of another fundamental limit in the cellular directional mechanosensing owing to the nonlinear nature of the relationship between the mechanostimulus and the spatial signals registered by the cell .",
    "indeed , all nonlinear statistical estimation techniques , including the one used by the cell , intrinsically suffer from the appearance of a low snr threshold effect beyond which the signal estimation can no longer be considered as reliable .",

    "<S> many eukaryotic cells are able to perform directional mechanosensing by directly measuring minute spatial differences in the mechanical stress on their membranes . here </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the limits of a single mechanosensitive channel activation using a two - state double - well model for the gating mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we then focus on the physical limits of directional mechanosensing by a single cell having multiple mechanosensors and subjected to a shear flow inducing a nonuniform membrane tension . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the accuracy in sensing the mechanostimulus direction not only increases with cell size and exposure to a signal , but also grows for cells with a near - critical membrane prestress . finally , the existence of a nonlinear threshold effect , fundamentally limiting the cell s ability to effectively perform directional mechanosensing at a low signal - to - noise ratio , is uncovered . </S>"
