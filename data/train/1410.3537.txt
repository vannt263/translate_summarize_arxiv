    "magnetized stellar winds have long been recognized as the major source of angular momentum extraction in main sequence stars @xcite . in order to reliably assess the stellar wind torque , the acceleration profile and the magnetic field geometry of the wind are needed .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that , in particular , complex magnetic topologies of cool stars could significantly alter the torque ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to more simple topologies .",
    "three dimensional numerical simulations provide today a reliable way to compute , in a dynamically self - consistent way , the torque arising from stellar wind with complex magnetic fields for a large variety of stars .",
    "however , no consensual parametrization of fully three - dimensional , non - axisymmetric stellar wind torques has yet been proposed in the literature .",
    "furthermore , the growing number of know exoplanets triggered renewed interest in the recent years in the interactions existing between star and close - in planets ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* in this volume ) .",
    "in particular , close - in planets can magnetically interact with their host , which leads to a direct transfer of angular momentum due to a magnetic link between the two objects ( among numerous other effects as well , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there in ) .",
    "several analytical studies ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have been pursued in the past years to better constrain our understanding of this angular momentum transfer .",
    "in a recent work , @xcite explored the efficiency of the angular momentum transfer as a function of the relative position of the orbiting planet in the stellar wind and of the topology of the planetary field with 2.5d simulations . in order to validate the trends they found ,",
    "3d numerical simulations taking into account the adequate geometry of the problem are needed ( see * ? ? ? * for an example of such global modelling ) .",
    "we report here an ongoing effort in developing magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations of the stellar winds of cool stars in three dimensions .",
    "we consider one - fluid and ideal models of stellar winds which are very simple compared to more recent solar wind models ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , they inherit important conservation properties from their 2.5d counterparts ( see * ? ? ? * and section [ sec : rotating - frame-1 ] ) .",
    "we show in this work that ensuring such conservation properties is mandatory to derive physically meaningful global trends from grids of numerical simulations . by such",
    ", they are thus of particular interest for our understanding of the gyro - chronology of cool stars .",
    "in addition , we focus here on the numerical difficulties associated with a rotating frame , anticipating eventual star - planet interactions studies with such stellar wind models .",
    "following the preliminary work in 2.5d axisymmetric geometry described in @xcite , we adapted our stellar wind model to a 3d cartesian geometry .",
    "we implemented the same `` 3-layer '' boundary conditions to improve the conservation properties of our numerical solution .",
    "we use the pluto code @xcite which solves the following set of ideal mhd equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the plasma density , @xmath2 its velocity , @xmath3 the gas pressure , @xmath4 the magnetic field , and @xmath5 is composed of gravitational acceleration ( which is time - independent ) and the coriolis and centrifugal forces of a rotating frame @xmath6 .",
    "the sound speed is given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the adiabatic exponent .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the specific internal energy .",
    "we use an _ hll _ solver combined with a _ minmod _ limiter .",
    "a second - order runge - kutta is used for the time evolution , resulting in an overall second - order accurate numerical method .",
    "the solenoidality of the magnetic field is ensured with a constrained transport method in the static grid version of the model , and with powell s _ eight waves _ method in the amr version ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for an extensive description of the various methods that pluto offers .",
    "the structure of the wind directly depends on three velocity ratios defined at the surface of the star ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and on the ratio of specific heats @xmath8 .",
    "the three characteristic velocities are the sound speed @xmath11 , the alfvn speed @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the magnetic field strength at the stellar equator ) and the rotation speed @xmath14 ( in this work , the star is considered to rotate as a solid body ) .",
    "their ratios to the escape velocity @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the stellar mass and @xmath17 the stellar radius ) at the stellar surface then define a unique stellar wind solution .",
    "we choose for this study the same parameters as in @xcite , which we report in table [ tab : tab_params ] .",
    "we also compute the rotation rates associated with these velocities at the surface of the star and deduce the equivalent orbital radius of a virtual planet ( for a characteristic velocity @xmath18 , the equivalent normalized orbital radius @xmath19 can be approximated by @xmath20 , see equation [ eq : omega_rot ] ) .",
    ".fiducial stellar wind parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we give more extensive statistical properties of the distributions of deviations in the open field lines region in table [ tab : tab_stats ] for all the cases listed in table [ tab : tab_cases ] .",
    "it immediately appears that in all cases , the mean deviation ( and its standard deviation ) is the highest for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the hr cases bring a significant improvement in the conservation of those two quantities , and in particular in their standard deviation .",
    "this shows that with a sufficiently high resolution , the angular momentum loss rate calculation could be robustly estimated from such three - dimensional models .",
    "the lack of conservation of @xmath23 in stellar wind models is also generally accompanied by large longitudinal variations of the rotation rate of the wind . in the context of magnetic star - planet interactions ,",
    "the rotation of the wind is naturally key to assess the eventual effect on the planetary magnetosphere and on the secular evolution of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "only stellar wind models with acceptable conservation properties should be used to assess the effects of those interactions .",
    "we have presented a comparative study of simple , 3d models of the stellar wind of cool stars .",
    "we focused our study on the numerical problems that can arise from the use of _",
    "( i ) _ a cartesian grid and _ ( ii ) _ a ( fast ) rotating frame in the context of star - planet interactions .",
    "our results suggest that , without sufficient spatial resolution , a rotating frame with a rotation rate higher than the stellar rotation rate should be avoided .",
    "the numerical experiments presented here were conducted for a small stellar rotation rate . because of this small rotation rate",
    ", small errors arising from the cartesian grid can lead to dramatic changes in the stellar wind solution .",
    "we expect the issues encountered in this work to be significantly lower in cases with higher stellar rotation rates , and adaptative mesh refinement seems to be an adequate , generic solution to overcome those numerical difficulties .",
