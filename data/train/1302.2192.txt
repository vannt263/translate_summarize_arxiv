    "a slight asymmetry appears also in spectra of fig.4 , although these spectra can be just a little less well fitted without introducing explicitly the fe@xmath58 component .",
    "the pairs of fe@xmath0/co@xmath58 and fe@xmath58/co@xmath0 can be considered as valence tautomers , and we explain the asymmetry in these spectra by electron transfer from fe@xmath0 to co@xmath58 . the formation and rupture of the chemical bonds implies no migration of atoms but only migration of electrons .",
    "the cobalt ions remain in low - spin state as the sixth electron of fe@xmath0 transfers from t@xmath31 orbital of fe@xmath0 to e@xmath124 orbital of co@xmath0 .",

    "the tautomers fe@xmath0/mn@xmath58and fe@xmath58/mn@xmath0 are able to form different crystal phases which give way to each other as temperature changes .    in the ferrous cobalticyanides ,",
    "no abrupt phase change was found to be caused by the charge - transferred states . on the other hand",
    ", we observed that the content of fe@xmath58 can be changed depending on the excess of fecl@xmath4 and dilution degree in the course of precipitation of fe[co(cn)@xmath3@xmath125h@xmath4o .",
    "rapidly synthesized isotope - enriched compound contained up to 15 - 20% of fe@xmath58 , however , the content of fe@xmath58 was reduced down to just 5% through reducing the reaction rate in dilute solutions . most probably , the lack or misplacement of water molecules is needed to stabilize locally the charge - transferred states and make them observable in mssbauer spectra .",
    "it appears in this case that the rapidly prepared samples are not saturated in c - water .",
    "the sites of fe@xmath0 nearest to the nodes lacking the coordination water are subject of local tautomer transformation . in a slowly synthesized fe@xmath94[co(cn)@xmath3@xmath90h@xmath4o",
    "such crystallization defects are reduced .",
    "measuring the mssbauer spectra above room temperature supports this concept . with raising temperature",
    "the area of the fe@xmath58 subspectrum starts to increase irreversibly .",
    "thermogravimetric analysis showed that the loss of sample weight occurs at heating practically starting from room temperature .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum measured _ in situ _ in a furnace at  318 k shows the area of the fe@xmath58 doublet increased up to 37% .",
    "the same sample measured _ ex - situ _ after prolonged ( 1 week ) heat treatment at 60@xmath25c showed the area of the fe@xmath58 increased up to 57% .",
    "the equilibrium hydration degree at 60@xmath25c is related with nearly half iron species transformed to fe@xmath58 .",
    "longer exposure in air at at 60@xmath25c induces no further increase of the spectral asymmetry and the area of spectral component with is of 0.39 mm / s remains at the level of 60% .",
    "the isomer shift of 0.39 mm / s is attributable , in principle , either to high - spin fe@xmath58 or to low spin fe@xmath0 . the latter was observed below the spin - state transition in csfe[cr(cn)@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches to lattice - dynamic calculations@xcite,@xcite show that the change in the electronic state is closely related to the structure expansion as the lattice parameter grows between the low - spin and high - spin forms from 1.03 nm to 1.07 nm . in fe@xmath15[co(cn)@xmath3@xmath84h@xmath4o ,",

    "the susceptibility increased too little compared to what is expected for the increase of @xmath48 upto 5.9 @xmath44 . with the weight loss taken into account this result",
    "would rather indicate the formation of an intermediate - spin state of fe@xmath58 which is known for strongly distorted octahedral coordinations with two alternate ligands in _ cis_-configuration@xcite .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy was applied to study the mixed - valence ( fe@xmath0-co@xmath58 ) pb analogues which displayed the mixed - orbital ground states of fe@xmath0 ions . the ground state mixing originates from both the distortion isomerism and the varied composition of fe@xmath0 nearest - neighbor environment . in the a - free pb analogues ,",
    "water molecules enter the first coordination sphere of the fe@xmath0 ions .",
    "there appears two kinds of anisotropic ligand configurations which are the intrinsic generant of the singlet and doublet orbital ground states .",
    "the fe@xmath0 sites are thus classified into two types .",
    "distribution of the anionic vacancies ( water - filled pores ) over the framework is characterized by the order parameter for two long - range order models pm@xmath26 m or im@xmath26 m .",
    "these models are relevant to the pb analogues of the 4:3 and 3:2 stoichiometries , respectively .",
    "two water molecules within the first coordination sphere of fe@xmath0 is the most populated configuration of the random model fm@xmath26 m and ordered models pm@xmath26 m or im@xmath26 m .",
    "the short - range order event occurrence in pb analogues of the 3:2 and 4:3 stoichiometries favors the cis- and trans- conformations , respectively .",
    "orbital singlet is the lowest in energy state for the cis - conformation .",
    "accordingly , in the a - free ferrous cobalticyanide pb analogue , the mssbauer spectra of fe@xmath0 are dominated by the larger quadrupole - splitting component .    in the a - filled pb analogues , where the the water ligands are withdrawn from the fe@xmath0 coordination sphere ,",
    "the least anisotropic charge distribution attainable for the cases of a = rb and cs is the orbital doublet ground state . for a = na and k ,",
    "the thermally - induced interconversions between the doublet and singlet ground states were observed attributed to distortion isomerism .",
    "charge - transfered states intrinsic in the pb analogues with negative thermal expansion@xcite are suggested to be the source of the lattice distortions associated with the distortion isomerism .",
    "asymmetry of mssbauer spectra is attributed to the admixture of a small content ( at the level of @xmath1265% ) of the fe@xmath58 species associated with the charge - transferred states .",
    "since the octahedral sites fen@xmath16 possess a higher symmetry than the sites fen@xmath127(h@xmath4o)@xmath128 we observe upon the insertion the a - ions into a free compounds that the value of mssbauer qs drops in ferrous cobalticyanides similarly to the archetypal prussian blue fe@xmath81[fe(cn)@xmath3@xmath95h@xmath4o@xcite .",
    "however , when the large - size a - ions ( cs , rb ) replace the small - size ones ( na , k ) through ionic exchange we observe the larger qs associated with lower symmetry local distortion isomer ; the sixth d - electron of the fe@xmath0 cation is self - localized on a single sublevel ( orbital singlet ) of the t@xmath31 group owing to strong lattice distortions around the implanting sites of the low - mobility ions .",
