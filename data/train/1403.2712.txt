    "is readily computed : @xmath911 moreover , it coincides with the stirling transform of @xmath906 .",
    "this proves that the random vector has a multivariate mixed poisson law , since @xmath912 is analytic in a neighbourhood of @xmath902 .",
    "moreover , the probability mass function is obtained according to @xmath913    moreover , we note that the basic limit theorem for the univariate case given in lemma  [ momseqmainlemma ] can be readily extended to limit laws for random vectors .",
    "looking at the examples in sections  [ ssec : records ] and  [ ssec : dyck ] leading to mixed poisson laws with rayleigh mixing distribution , and the example in section  [ momseqexampleblocks ] from  @xcite , it is desirable to find a unifying combinatorial scheme leading to mixed poisson distributions .",

    "we are interested in compositions of generating functions of the form @xmath916 .",

    "more generally , it is desirable to study the joint distributions @xmath923 via @xmath924 we will report on our findings on this refined analysis of compositions elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "several of the results presented in this work can be extended to a multivariate analysis involving a random vector @xmath925 by its mixed moments .",
    "it should be possible , at least for some of the examples presented , to use mixed poisson approximation techniques to derive distances , i.e. , the total variation distance , between the random variables of interest and the corresponding mixed poisson distributions , refining the results stated in this work .",
    "a natural question is to ask for a direct explanation of the critical growth rates of the second parameter , say @xmath206 , when the limit laws of the random variables @xmath216 change from the law of the mixing distribution @xmath0 to the mixed poisson distributions @xmath926 .",

    "<S> in this article we survey properties of mixed poisson distributions and probabilistic aspects of the stirling transform : given a non - negative random variable @xmath0 with moment sequence @xmath1 we determine a discrete random variable @xmath2 , whose moment sequence is given by the stirling transform of the sequence @xmath1 , and identify the distribution as a mixed poisson distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss properties of this family of distributions and present a simple limit theorem based on expansions of factorial moments instead of power moments . </S>",

    "<S> we also add several entirely new results : we analyse triangular urn models , where the initial configuration or the dimension of the urn is not fixed , but may depend on the discrete time @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the branching structure of plane recursive trees and its relation to table sizes in the chinese restaurant process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss root isolation procedures in cayley - trees , a parameter in parking functions , zero contacts in lattice paths consisting of bridges , and a parameter related to cyclic points and trees in graphs of random mappings , all leading to mixed poisson - rayleigh distributions . finally , we indicate how mixed poisson distributions naturally arise in the critical composition scheme of analytic combinatorics . </S>"
