    "the unexpected enhancement found in processes driven by the axial charge , namely the cases of first - forbidden beta decays in heavy nuclei  @xcite and the production of pions near threshold in @xmath2 reactions  @xcite , has given a new impetus to the study of meson - exchange currents ( mec ) in axial charge transitions .",
    "the findings are really remarkable . in the first process for example",
    "already known to be strongly renormalized by the presence of mec the results found by warburton  @xcite exceeded the anticipated theoretical estimate by a factor of two . in the second a new result in a region not available to experiment",
    "before the data overestimate the theoretical predictions ( only the one - body contribution ) by approximately a factor of five . despite this sizable difference between theory and experiment the first result",
    "is acknowledged as the most dramatic since the process of first - forbidden @xmath1-decay was thought to be ( at least to a large extent ) under theoretical control  @xcite .",
    "the subject of axial charge transitions becomes more relevant from the viewpoint of relativistic theories of the nucleus .",
    "most of the explanations advanced so far to account for these enhancements ( refs .",
    "@xcite in the first case and  @xcite in the second ) rely on the presence of scalar heavy - meson exchange between two nucleons .",
    "diagrams containing a nucleon - antinucleon pair originating ( or decaying ) into a scalar meson of @xmath3 500 mev using couplings from either the bonn or paris potentials seem to take care of the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental result .",
    "these large lorentz scalar potentials have long been a distinctive feature of relativistic calculations whose explicit need , however , had not shown up in the non - relativistic phenomenology of nuclear processes before .",
    "the calculations alluded to above ( non relativistic ) incorporate the scalar degree of freedom formally via meson - exchange currents .",
    "the connection between non - relativistic pair - exchange currents and relativistic mean - field theories for isovector currents was studied by delorme and towner  @xcite in their paper of 1987 ( in the case of isoscalar currents there were previous calculations by arima _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and blunden  @xcite ) .",
    "pair graphs are shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the relativistic hartree contribution is obtained by closing the line on nucleon 2 and is shown in diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) ( diagram ( d ) is usually recognized as the  backflow \" correction ) .",
    "the difference between both approaches is that whereas in the relativistic case the propagation of an antinucleon is included in the one - body green s function , in the non - relativistic case it can only be incorporated as an exchange current .",
    "delorme and towner found in their calculations large enhancements due to the scalar - exchange terms .",
    "their conclusion at the time for axial - charge transitions was that such enhancement ( and along with it the relativistic mean - field theory ) was hardly consistent with experiment .",
    "quite oppositely , they noticed that the conventional theory of meson exchange with short range cut - offs gave reasonable agreements with the data ( ignoring , of course , the contribution of pair diagrams ) .",
    "the more recent work of warburton on the one hand and the results of meyer _ et al . _ on the other , prompted a reanalysis of the existing calculations under the light of the new data .",
    "at the present time it is generally held that scalar heavy - meson exchanges can account for the discrepancies between the predictions and the actual data  @xcite .",
    "this situation opened up the ground for further exploration of the predictions of relativistic models of nuclear structure to axial - charge processes . since the physical content of the two descriptions ( non - relativistic vs. relativistic ) is different from the outset , the individual contribution of one- and two - body diagrams is not anticipated to be similar .",
    "we already mentioned that the one - body relativistic calculation includes the non - relativistic two - body pair graphs .",
    "conversely , the two - body contribution in the relativistic calculation sums diagrams ( like the one shown in fig.[fig2 ] ) that are not included in the traditional meson - exchange calculations .",
    "though , _ a priori _ , contributions of this type are small a comparision between both approaches will only be meaningful once full calculations of one and two - body processes are conducted within each framework .    with this in mind",
    "we study in this paper the contribution of two - body processes within the relativistic approach .",
    "we concentrate exclusively on first - forbidden beta decays in nuclei ( oxygen , tin and lead ) where the relativistic mean - field can be used reliably .",
    "regardless of the model the symmetries must be upheld .",
    "in particular chiral symmetry , namely the use of soft - pion theorems and current algebra , imposes a strong renormalization of the matrix elements due to pion - exchange processes ( particularly through the @xmath4-exchange diagram . )",
    "this mechanism needs to be incorporated explicitly into relativistic calculations since , at the mean - field level , the pion is absent due to parity arguments .",
    "it is clear that a relativistic description of axial - charge transitions in nuclei requires to go beyond the mean - field .",
    "a first approximation to the problem calls for a mean - field calculation ( impulse approximation ) to describe the one - body processes and additionally a mec calculation taking care of the  backflow \" and pion - exchange processes .",
    "we notice that the results of this programme are not expected to be free from the usual ambiguities of pion couplings in relativistic theories ( for a review of the current status see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , within the framework of a relativistic model ( quantum hadrodynamics ii ) we analyzed axial transitions  @xcite in heavy nuclei using the scheme outlined above .",
    "we obtained first the one - body contribution given by graphs ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; next , the rpa - type vertex corrections ( graphs ( d ) in the same figure )  @xcite and , finally we investigated the contribution of the pion - exchange currents  @xcite ( with no exchange diagrams . ) inspection of the results arrived at in this study showed that : first , despite some ambiguities related to the strength of the @xmath5n coupling constant , the sum of one- and two - body diagrams added up to an enhancement which was comparable to that obtained in non - relativistic calculations .",
    "second , the theoretical calculations could only be brought into agreement with the data when pseudovector @xmath6n coupling was used ( otherwise the results were anomalously large ) .",
    "third , two - body pion - exchange processes were indispensable to understand the axial - charge data .",
    "these conclusions were based on calculations conducted on two particular transitions , one in tl and the other in pb , and were intended to give an idea of what should be expected for other transitions in this mass region . in this paper",
    "we extend and deepen the analysis of the previous works .",
    "on the one hand , we give a complete description of the two - body pion - exchange contribution to the axial charge from the point of view of relativistic hadron theories . on the other",
    ", we extend the results of  @xcite and present results of mec contribution to axial charge matrix elements for tin and oxygen .",
    "the idea is to move to lighter nuclei to study mass dependence , and the influence of the scalar field in this contribution .    besides this introduction the paper contains two other sections .",
    "section  [ mecme ] , divided into two subsections , deals with the calculation of the matrix elements of the axial charge . in the first subsection",
    "we give some details about the hadronic model we employ and the way the axial two - body current is derived . in the second we describe at some length the scheme to carry out the actual calculation of the matrix elements of the current between the nuclear states .",
    "the last section contains a discussion of the results and of the potential ambiguities involved in the calculation .",
    "finally we present some conclusions .",
    "at tree level the two - body isovector axial vector current is given by the sum of the four diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the figure",
    "we have used the symbol @xmath7 to denote the field operator mediating the weak current .",
    "diagrams @xmath8 and @xmath9 turn out to be the most important since they involve pion exchanges which generate the longest - range exchange currents .",
    "the contribution of the other two diagrams ( involving the @xmath10 ) is known to be small  @xcite .",
    "the two - body current from diagrams @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be calculated using standard feynman rules . as stated meson and baryon propagators derived from some baryonic lagrangian",
    "are needed . throughout the paper",
    "we use the _ quantum hadrodynamical model ii _  ( qhd ",
    "ii ) of serot and walecka  @xcite .",
    "it includes the nucleon fields , two isoscalar meson fields the scalar @xmath11 and the vector @xmath12 and two charged isovector meson fields the pseudoscalar @xmath6 and the vector @xmath5 .",

    "as we will see below pseudoscalar coupling with the standard parameters gives very large predictions for the contribution of one- and two - body processes . as an alternative to the actual calculation",
    "we have considered substituting pseudovector for both pseudoscalar @xmath17 and @xmath18 couplings .",
    "we emphasize that despite the different predictions both couplings show the same correct behaviour in the low - energy limit ( in the two - body case ) and both satisfy the constraint of partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) .",

    "dh ( dirac - hartree ) and rha ( relativistic hartree approximation ) , are from ref.@xcite and are not tuned specifically to any particular mass region .",
    "the scalar masses were determined by fitting the charge radius of @xmath90ca .",
    "the other masses , fixed to their experimental values are , @xmath91 mev , @xmath92 mev , @xmath93 mev and @xmath94 mev . in the calculations we used @xmath95 from the fitting to the bulk symmetry energy @xmath96 mev .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the nucleons was considered via an additional @xmath97 dependence of the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 gev .",
    "tables  [ table2 ] to  [ table5 ] summarize our results . in the tables",
    "each row displays the result of the calculation of the matrix element corresponding to the multipole operator shown on the left .",
    "they are the axial coulomb operator ( eq.[coul ] ) and the polar - vector longitudinal @xmath100 \\cdot { \\vec{j}}^{2b}({\\vec{x } } ) , \\label{long}\\ ] ] and transverse electric , @xmath101 \\cdot { \\vec{j}}^{2b}({\\vec{x } } ) , \\label{tel}\\ ] ] operators . in the above we used the expression @xmath102 with @xmath103",
    "the vector spherical harmonics .",
    "each table is divided in three columns : the first one ( nr ) shows the results of a one - body non - relativistic calculation and has been included , mainly , for comparative purposes . the second ( dh ) shows the results of : i ) a one - body ( ia ) calculation , ii ) one- plus two - body ( ia+mec ) calculation and iii ) the resulting increment ( @xmath104 ) , all three obtained within the relativistic dirac - hatree approximation where the vacuum structure is ignored .",
    "the third column has a structure similar to the previous one but the one - loop vacuum corrections that originate due to the presence of the strong meson fields are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the increment @xmath104 defined in the tables parametrizes the difference between the  effective \" axial coupling constant , as determined from the analysis of the experimental transition rates , and the  free \" coupling constant such that , @xmath105 we recall that the  best fit \" value reported by warburton in his analysis of nuclei in the a=206 - 212 mass region was @xmath106    the first thing to notice from the tables is that , as indicated above , the longitudinal and transverse electric contributions in the one - body case are substantially smaller than their coulomb counterparts ( more than a factor of ten in lead and tin ; four times smaller in thallium ) .",
    "based on this result we restrict the two - body calculation to the contribution of the axial charge where , on the other hand , we expect the larger contributions coming from pion exchange .    despite not being the main thrust of this paper we devote one paragraph to comment on the one - body vector contribution where we notice the following . in the lead transition ( table  [ table2 ] ) , the ia result for @xmath107 and @xmath108 is enhanced a barely 3% in dh ( 1% in rha ) with respect to the nria calculation , a result that is consistent with warburton s finding for the polar vector enhancement , namely @xmath109 .",
    "this behaviour does not maintain , however , and we find that in the thallium decay to lead the enhancement is 65% ( 34% in rha ) and in tin is 23% ( 18% in rha ) over the nria .",
    "thus , there is a discrepancy between this calculation and the fit to the data in the heavy - mass region  @xcite for the vector contribution . _ a priori _ this difference",
    "could be adscribed to the simple - minded model used here to describe the structure of the states involved ; however is hard to see how a refinement in this direction could reduce drastically the last two values .    back to the analysis of the tables the next thing we notice is that , as expected , the one - body calculation is consistently larger in the dirac - hartree approach than in the relativistic hartree approximation .",
    "this is due to the value of the effective mass @xmath110 which is smaller in rha than in dh . in principle",
    ", there is no theoretical argument favoring the use of one to the other given that , in both cases , the model parameters are fitted independently to bulk nuclear - matter properties . for convenience , in the analysis that follows we shall limit our discussion to the rha results .    in the introduction we argued that in the relativistic framework pair diagrams are already taken into account in ia ; hence the analysis must proceed by studying the contribution of mec along with the ia results .",
    "thus , the @xmath111 transition in @xmath112 @xmath113 shows that some 40% of the enhancement is present at the one - body level and a further 80% shows up at the two - body level bringing their sum up to a total enhancement of @xmath114 .",
    "the other transition we studied in a heavy nucleus , @xmath115 in @xmath116 @xmath117 gives a 30% enhancement due to one - body processes and 55% coming from the meson exchange contributions .",
    "if we move to lighter nuclei the situation does not change much as far as the overall increment of the effective coupling constant is concerned . in the @xmath118 decay , dominated by the single particle transition @xmath119",
    ", we obtained 42% enhancement from ia and 33% from the mec processes . in the oxygen region the decay @xmath120 was studied using a simple model of nuclear structure where the first excited state of @xmath121 , @xmath122 ( with an excitation energy of 120 kev ) was described by the mixing of two particle - hole configurations , @xmath123_{0 ^ -}\\ , \\rangle\\ , + \\",
    ", \\lambda\\,\\ , |[1d_{3/2 } 1p_{3/2}]_{0 ^ -}\\ , \\rangle \\label{lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and where the mixing amplitude @xmath124 was taken to be the typical @xmath125  @xcite .",
    "in this case we obtained 48% ( ia ) and 42% ( mec ) for the largest component , and 18% ( ia ) and 10% ( mec ) for the smallest .",
    "overall the calculated value of @xmath104 is around 20% of that determined empirically in the heavy - mass region .",
    "the ratio of one- to two - body processes , however , is not distributed uniformly in mass .",
    "as one moves towards the heavier nuclei the share between the one - body and two - body processes is shifted from the former to the latter .",
    "it is not straightforward to explain this trade off .",
    "naively , it could be argued that the increase in the density implies a reduced effective mass and a corresponding enhancement in the nucleon propagators ; one such change , however , should affect both the one - body and two - body processes in roughly the same manner .",
    "furthermore , the argument of enhanced matrix elements due to off - diagonal operators ( operators connecting upper to lower components of the spinors ) it is not strictly true for @xmath1-decay transitions where the initial and final states do not coincide .",
    "the value of the matrix element depends on the overlap of initial and final wave functions and this overlap diminishes as we go up in mass in the periodic table . a case in point",
    "are the different enhancements obtained for the vector operators , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , which are very different in different transitions despite being both off - diagonal .",
    "summarizing , the results of the tables indicate a somewhat stable contribution of the one - body processes of around 40% whereas the two - body share seems to increase slightly with the mass ( o:42% ; sn:33% ; tl:55% ; bi:80% ) .    the calculation in oxygen with a simple nuclear model",
    "gives an enhancement close to 100% . before the work of haxton and johnson  @xcite in 1990",
    ", this result would have been considered anomalous .",
    "these authors found that the usually accepted 50% enhancement of the coupling constant fell short by some 40% of the value necessary to agree with their calculation of the @xmath1-decay rate of the 120 kev 0@xmath126 state in nitrogen .",
    "this discrepancy plus the one found in heavy nuclei prompted a more careful examination of previous calculations .",
    "presently , this discrepancy is not considered dramatic in any mass region  @xcite though there seems to be still some room for other effects .",
    "our results seem to indicate a similar behaviour ( so long as we stick to the rha model and use pseudovector coupling ) .    regarding the type of coupling , table  [ table6 ] illustrates the difference between pseudoscalar and pseudovector contributions for a particular transition in lead .",
    "use of the former leads , typically , to an increment of the calculated enhancement of approximately 50% with respect to the same calculation with pseudovector coupling .",
    "this is not , _",
    "per se _ , ground enough to preclude the use of pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "however , for the many - body problem is more efficient  @xcite to work with a lagrangian with pseudovector coupling and no@xmath18 term because in this form the soft - pion limits appear naturally in terms of just pions and nucleons ( without the necessity of subtle cancellations with terms containing the @xmath11 ) .    one point to notice is the dependence of the mec results on the value of @xmath127 .",
    "calculations in finite nuclei within qhd ( see , for example , refs.@xcite and @xcite ) usually employ @xmath128 ( the value used in this work ) instead of @xmath129 as calculated from the decay of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "the first value is obtained fitting the symmetry energy of the empirical mass formula ; this is a many - body argument which supports its use over that obtained from @xmath5 decay .",
    "however , aside from this , there are no further arguments which are strong enough to discriminate them ; this ambiguity translates into a downwards 40% uncertainty in the final mec results .",
    "it is relevant to comment that the relativistic one - body calculation is not sensitive to the value of the @xmath5 coupling constant .    a final word about core polarization .",
    "in two previous works  @xcite we investigated the _ isovector _",
    "weak response of the core to the external perturbation in the approximation of nuclear matter and in linear response theory summing the ring diagrams to all orders in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the so - called _ backflow _ correction  @xcite .",
    "we found that the effects of this core polarization ( of positive and negative energy nucleons ) were sizable for large values of the momentum transfer ( for example those typical of the muon capture processes , @xmath130 ) but could be neglected for the small momentum transfers involved in nuclear @xmath1 decay .",
    "thus , we do not anticipate any dramatic increase in the calculated @xmath104 beyond those presented in this work .    summarizing",
    ", we have studied the contribution of two - body ( mec ) processes to axial charge transitions for nuclei in the lead , tin and oxygen regions .",
    "we conducted calculations in dirac - hartree approximation ( the walecka model ) and in the relativistic hartree approximation ( where the full one - nucleon - loop effects are included . ) along the paper we discussed the sensitivities of the calculation to the change in some of the couplings and of the parameters involved . with the choices described above the results we obtained",
    "indicate that one- and two - body processes enhance the matrix elements of the axial - charge operator by some ( 100@xmath020 ) % in all three regions studied .",
    "this result agrees with the enhancement of the axial - coupling constant needed to understand theoretically a fit to eighteen first - forbidden @xmath1 decay transitions in the lead region . from the results of this calculation",
    "the presence of a heavy scalar meson to explain a physical effect gets further support .",
