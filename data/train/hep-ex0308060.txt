    "the overlap area determines an allowed region for the position of the ut apex .",
    "comparison of individual measurements , described below , enable a consistency check of the ckm description of quark mixing and can give hints of yet unobserved phenomena .",
    "the @xmath6  element of the ckm matrix has traditionally been obtained from the measured branching fractions of @xmath8 decays , the semileptonic decays of charged and neutral kaons @xmath9 .",
    "recently , a new measurement of the @xmath10 branching fraction in the electron decay mode was presented by the brookhaven e865 experiment @xcite .",
    "the result @xmath11 is about 2.3 standard deviations higher than the world average of previous measurements of this quantity @xcite .",
    "the measured branching ratio , where the last error comes from the uncertainty in the normalization decay modes used in the experiment , can be converted into the value of @xmath12 .",
    "the error on this value receives a significant contribution from the theoretical estimate of the @xmath13 decay form factor @xcite . using the value of @xmath14 ,",
    "evaluated most precisely from the super - allowed nuclear fermi beta decays @xcite , and the above result for @xmath6 , the unitarity requirement in the first row of the ckm matrix is perfectly satisfied   can be safely neglected . ] .",
    "a possible disagreement between the world averages of @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be addressed by the forthcoming precision results from kloe and na48 experiments .",
    "due to a reasonably good theoretical understanding and a satisfactory statistical power of the sample , the determination of @xmath17  and @xmath18  elements relies on the measurements of semileptonic @xmath19 meson decays , using either exclusive or inclusive methods . within the exclusive methods ,",
    "the @xmath20 decay channel is the most prominent one for the @xmath21 transitions .",
    "decays into @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons and a lepton pair were used to probe the @xmath24 transitions .",
    "inclusive methods comprise a determination of the total b meson semileptonic width combined with measurements of various moments of distributions that reduce the theoretical uncertainties entering the ckm element extraction .",
    "the differential decay rate for the @xmath20 can be expressed in terms of a four - velocity transfer @xmath25 using a single @xmath19 meson decay form factor @xmath26 , which coincides with the isgur - wise function up to the heavy quark symmetry breaking terms @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the efficiency corrected differential decay rate @xmath27 is measured and extrapolated to the maximum momentum transfer ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "measurement uncertainties are dominated by the systematic errors as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_ex_sum ] ( left ) @xcite .    at the @xmath29 energies ,",
    "the @xmath30 resolution is influenced by a spread of @xmath19 meson momenta .",
    "another important source of the systematic error is the modeling of the @xmath31 background . at the @xmath32 energies the kinematic constraints enable a better @xmath30 resolution and an effective @xmath31 rejection , but the efficiency for the reconstruction of low momentum pions from @xmath33 falls rapidly at low values of @xmath30 .",
    "using the interval of values @xmath34 @xcite and the average value of @xmath35 one obtains @xmath36 where the first error represents the experimental and the second the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the relation between the semileptonic decay width of @xmath19 mesons and the @xmath17   can be written as @xmath37 . while the average of measurements of the left hand side of equation contributes about 1% to the relative error on the @xmath17 , the theoretical factor @xmath38 introduces an error of about 5% @xcite .",
    "the solution is provided in the framework of operator product expansion , where the semileptonic width is expressed to order @xmath39 using two parameters and heavy quark masses .",
    "the same parameters enter the expressions for differential distributions of several observables like the energy of the lepton in semileptonic decays , the invariant mass of the produced hadronic system or the energy of the photon in radiative b meson decays @xcite .",
    "measurements of moments of those distributions enable the relevant parameters determination and hence help reducing the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath17   from the measured semileptonic width .",
    "a summary of @xmath40 measurements at @xmath32 energies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_ex_sum ] ( right ) @xcite .",
    "the precision is almost identical to the measurements performed by the lep experiments , which benefit from the fact that the total lepton energy spectrum can be used in analyzes .",
    "combination of results together with the measured @xmath19 meson lifetime yields a value of @xmath41  mev @xcite .",
    "cleo and delphi experiments measured the moments ( up to the third ) of distributions mentioned above @xcite .",
    "taking as an input the value of the semileptonic width , @xmath17  evaluations @xcite can be summarized as @xcite @xmath42 the experimental error includes contributions from moments and semileptonic width measurements , while the theoretical error reflects the uncertainties due to the perturbative qcd and @xmath43 series truncation .",
    "the exclusive methods of @xmath18   determination consist of @xmath44 measurements over a limited interval of lepton pair invariant mass ( @xmath45 ) , lepton momentum or lepton energy , in order to suppress the dominant @xmath21 background .",
    "one or more dimensional fits to distributions of kinematical variables , separating the @xmath46 transitions from the background , make use of isospin relations between the charged and neutral @xmath47 and @xmath48 decay modes . in order to obtain the full @xmath49 , where @xmath50 represents a light meson ,",
    "an extrapolation to the full range of fitted observables is necessary , introducing a model dependence .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vub_ex_sum ] ( left ) .",
    "error bars mark the statistical uncertainty , while the total line represents the quadratic sum of statistical and experimental systematic errors ; for the latter the largest contributions arise from detector simulation used in neutrino reconstruction and @xmath51 background modeling .",
    "lines below the results show the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "they are obtained using various form factors , calculated from lattice qcd , light cone sum rules or quark models , with different methods and are thus not directly comparable .",
    "the belle experiment made a first measurement of @xmath52 @xcite , however the value of @xmath18  is not quoted . in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainty ,",
    "the cleo experiment has performed a measurement of @xmath53 ( last line of fig . [",
    "fig : vub_ex_sum ] ( left ) ) in distinct @xmath45 bins @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is a lower systematic error arising from the @xmath45 dependence of the efficiency , and the discriminating power of the @xmath45 distribution for different form factor models . for the exclusive @xmath18   determination",

    "however , in isolating the @xmath24 transitions , one is restricted to a limited interval of kinematic variables , separating the signal from the major @xmath21 background .",
    "while stringent requirements on the lepton energy , hadronic or lepton pair invariant mass in semileptonic decays lead to a better purity of the selected sample , the selection of events in a vicinity of the phase space boundaries introduces large non - perturbative corrections to theoretical predictions and hence a larger theoretical error @xcite .",
    "a number of measurements using individual or several of the above mentioned observables for @xmath51 separation were reported .",
    "for the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the hadronic system ( @xmath56 ) , produced in a semileptonic @xmath19 meson decay at @xmath19 factories , one needs to separate the decay products of individual @xmath19 mesons .",

    "[ fig : vub_ex_sum ] ( right ) . to separate decay products , belle collaboration uses a `` simulated annealing '' technique , based on maximization of a likelihood function for a correct and wrong assignment of particles , by iteratively exchanging particles between the two @xmath19 mesons @xcite .",

    "[ fig : vub_ex_sum ] ( right ) as `` belle ( @xmath58 ) '' .",
    "similarly as in the case of the exclusive @xmath18   determination , uncertainties of all results shown are dominated by the theoretical error introduced by the extrapolation of @xmath51 yield to the full interval of kinematic observables . as an illustration ,",
    "the average of babar , belle and cleo measurements @xcite using the lepton energy for @xmath24/@xmath21 separation , yields @xmath59 when the theoretical error is taken as completely correlated , while experimental systematic error is treated as uncorrelated .",
    "the @xmath62 value is determined from the ratio of @xmath63 and @xmath64 meson oscillation frequencies , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the use of the ratio instead of the individual measurements is motivated by a partial cancellation of the theoretical uncertainties . while the world average of @xmath65 has a relative error of 1.2% @xcite and",
    "is completely dominated by the measurements performed at b factories @xcite , the @xmath67 limits steam from lep experiments and will until the lhc era remain in the domain of the tevatron collider . the amplitude method for the @xmath64 oscillations measurements",
    "consists of fitting the observed decay time distribution with the amplitude of oscillations as a free parameter .",
    "the fitted amplitudes at given values of @xmath66 are then converted into the lower limit on the oscillation frequency .",

    "these theoretically clean decays are expected to yield a value of @xmath72 consistent with the above quoted result .",

    "the angle @xmath77 of the ut can be determined examining the @xmath78 decays @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for the process involves a tree digram as well as a significant contribution from the penguin processes , and hence the interpretation of the cp asymmetry measurements is complicated . while the belle result @xcite points to a direct cp violation in these processes ( fig .",
