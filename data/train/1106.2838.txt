    "about sixty years ago , newton and wigner showed that there is no position operator for a massless particle with spin higher than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this fact lead many authors to conclude that it is not possible to define a wave function for a photon , which has zero mass and spin ( or helicity ) 1 .",
    "however , bialynicki - birula @xcite and , independently , sipe @xcite , introduced a function of the position and time coordinates that completely describes the quantum state of a photon . in their opinion , which is shared by us , such function may be referred to as the photon wave function .",
    "the wave equation for this function can be derived from the einstein kinematics for a particle with spin 1 and zero mass in the same way that the dirac equation is obtained for a massive particle with spin @xmath0 @xcite . a strong argument in favor of this photon wave function formulation is that the corresponding wave equation is completely equivalent to the maxwell equations in vacuum .    in the present work",
    "we extend the bialynicki - birula  sipe formalism to include the interaction of photons with non - absorptive continuous media . in section [ sec : vac ] we briefly discuss the photon wave equation in vacuum and some properties of photon wave functions . in section [ sec : medium ] the photon wave equation is modified including a term associated with the induced current density in the medium , that makes it equivalent to the macroscopic maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves in the presence of matter . in section [ sec : secquant ] we apply the second quantization procedure to the photon wave function formalism in a linear non - dispersive and non - absorptive medium , allowing for description of quantum phenomena . in section [ sec : scat ]",
    "we present a method for treating the scattering of photons by material media . as an example of application of the proposed formalism , in section [ sec : cpd ] the state of the photon pairs generated by parametric down conversion",
    "is obtained with an intuitive derivation . in section [ sec : conc ] we present our concluding remarks and summarize our results .",
    "the bialynicki - birula ",
    "sipe wave equation for a photon described by the wave function @xmath1 is @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is an operator that acts on the photon helicity .",
    "a spin one can be represented by a vector in the 3-dimensional complex space , so the vectorial character of @xmath6 incorporates its internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the photon wave function can be decomposed in the eigenvectors of the helicity operator @xmath5 and also in its real and imaginary parts : @xmath7 if we associate the real vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the electric and magnetic fields of the photon and @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the permittivity and the permeability of free space , together with the divergence - free condition of the photon wave function @xmath12 ( which is essential to arrive at the photon wave equation from einstein kinematics @xcite ) are completely equivalent to the set of the four maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "the eigenvalues of the helicity operator correspond to photons with left and right circular polarizations .",
    "an arbitrary polarization state can be written as a particular combination of these two .",
    "there is a peculiarity in the form for the photon wave function : its modulus squared has the unit of energy density , not of probability density , and agrees with the classical electromagnetic energy density .",
    "this fact is associated with the problem of non - localization of the photon @xcite , and it happens that the energy density is the local useful concept , since photons have no other scalar quantities such as mass or charge , but only energy @xcite .",
    "the normalization condition is that the integral of @xmath13 is equal to the expectation value of the photon energy .",
    "there is no direct association of the modulus squared of the wave function with the probability density of detecting the photon in the region , unless we consider dimensions larger than the photon wavelength @xcite .",
    "but neither the localization of massive relativistic particles is a clear concept . in this sense , photons are not significantly different from massive particles , as both can have an exponential falloff of their wave functions with distance in relativistic treatments @xcite , the difference being that photons are always relativistic .",
    "our proposal to treat the interaction of photons with continuous media is to include a term proportional to the current density @xmath14 induced in the media due to the presence of the photon in : @xmath15 this approach is similar to the one adopted by keller @xcite .",
    "however , keller was interested in calculating the wave function of a photon emitted from an atom and the current density was a source term .",
    "here we are considering continuous media and the current density @xmath14 represents a response of the medium due to the presence of the photon , not being an independent source of photons .",
    "so the objective of the present work is very different from keller s , although the initial step is similar .",
    "when considering continuous media , we are implicitly assuming that the photon wavelength is much larger than the distances between the atoms that compose the medium , in such a way that the collective motion of the charges may be approximated by a continuous current density .",
    "we can write @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the magnetization and electric polarization of the medium and @xmath19 is the free current density , all of them being functions of the electric and magnetic fields of the photon .",
    "for instance , in a non - dispersive dielectric medium the polarization can be written as @xmath20 expanded in linear and non - linear responses to the photon field . since the non - linear response terms represent situations in which there are more than one photon involved , a procedure of second quantization of the photon wave function is necessary to correctly describe them .",
    "this issue will become clear in section [ sec : cpd ] where we treat the parametric down - conversion , which arises from the second - order non - linear response of the medium .",
    "so , if we want to deal with the wave function of a single photon , we must disregard the non - linear response of the medium . in section [ sec : cpd ]",
    "we will be interested in the interaction of photons with non - linear media after applying the second quantization procedure to the photon wave function , so we will continue referring to the current density @xmath14 in this section without specification of its linear or non - linear behaviors .    using the photon wave function from , we can see that is equivalent to the maxwell equations by writing its real and imaginary parts .",
    "its real part with the application of the operator @xmath5 and its imaginary part give : @xmath21 @xmath22 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . taking the divergence of the above equations",
    "we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the free charge density and we have @xmath27 .",
    "what the above equations tell us is that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 at any particular instant of time , which is true before the photon interacts with the media , these relations must be always satisfied . with this argument",
    "we complete the proof that is equivalent to the set of maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves .",
    "so our treatment predicts that the behavior of photons in linear non - absorptive media , where a one - photon theory may be used , is completely analogous to the behavior of classical electromagnetic pulses .",
    "this statement is supported by experiments @xcite and is difficult to obtain with the formalism of second quantization @xcite .",
    "so we believe that in the same way that the schrdinger equation is used to treat the behavior of massive particles under the action of a classical potential , the formalism of this section may be used to describe the interaction of photons with material media when there is no absorption or emission of photons . in cases where there is absorption or emission of photons",
    "we must apply the second quantization procedure on the photon wave function , to be done in the next section .    from we",
    "can derive a continuity equation for the photon wave function .",
    "taking the scalar product with @xmath30 on both sides of and summing the complex conjugate , after verifying that @xmath31 and using the vectorial identity @xmath32 , we arrive at @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the current density of the photon wave function . using ( [ psi ] ) and taking the time average of @xmath35 over one period of oscillation of the photon field , we have @xmath36 , analogous to the electromagnetic energy flux .",
    "the term @xmath37 represents the density of work done on the charges of the medium per unit time .",
    "the continuity equation for the photon wave function is an energy continuity equation . in our formalism",
    ", we are assuming that the photon energy density has always the same form when written in terms of the photon electric and magnetic fields , independently of the medium , and that the material energy density is calculated by the work done on the charges of the medium , without distinction whether the work is done on bound or free currents .",
    "this approach differs from the one adopted by bialynicki - birula to treat photons in material media @xcite , where the photon wave function is written as @xmath38 and there is no current term in the photon wave equation , since the bound currents are included in the photon wave function via @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the photon energy density @xmath42 is a function of the electric permittivity @xmath43 and magnetic permeability @xmath44 of the medium since we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 in a linear isotropic medium .    when a photon enters a medium , part of its energy is transferred to the medium .",
    "the same occurs with its momentum .",
    "the discussion of the correct form for the momentum and energy densities of classical electromagnetic waves in a medium has been the subject of a long debate @xcite .",
    "the eventual conclusion is that there are many compatible ways of defining the electromagnetic and material parts of the energy and momentum densities of electromagnetic waves in material media .",
    "here we are assuming a particular division in the quantum domain , where the electromagnetic parts are @xmath47 for the energy density , @xmath35 for the energy flux and @xmath48 for the momentum density .",
    "this division has been successfully tested with reasonable models in the classical domain @xcite .",
    "our formulation gives the same results as bialynicki - birula s for linear media : photons obey the maxwell equations , the difference being that we implicitly divided the total energy and momentum of the photon in the medium in their electromagnetic and material parts , associating only the electromagnetic part with the photon wave function .",
    "as a consequence , our formulation can be readily extended to non - linear media after the procedure of second quantization of the photon wave function , representing an advantage to treat more general cases , as we discuss in the next sections .",
    "the second quantization procedure can be applied to the one - photon theory to build a quantum field theory for describing states with an arbitrary number of photons .",
    "this procedure is described in @xcite . here",
    "we will make a similar second quantization procedure in an infinite linear non - dispersive and non - absorptive medium .",
    "in such a medium , the material acquires an energy density @xmath49 $ ] due to the presence of the photon @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being the electric and magnetic susceptibilities of the medium , apart from the electromagnetic energy density @xmath47 .",
    "so the total energy density of the photon in such a medium can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the `` dressed photon '' wave function , with @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath55 .",
    "this form for @xmath56 is equivalent to the one used by bialynicki - birula in the case of non - dispersive linear media @xcite .",
    "however , if dispersion is included the modulus squared of the bialynicki - birula s form for the photon wave function in the medium does not give the total energy density anymore , while the division of the total energy density in electromagnetic and material parts remains valid @xcite .",
    "although we will not treat dispersive media here , it is important to stress this fundamental difference between the treatments .",
    "the above relations can be inverted , giving @xmath57\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total energy of the `` dressed photon '' can be written as @xmath58 the `` dressed photon '' wave function can be decomposed in its energy eigenstates , which are plane - wave modes : @xmath59 with @xmath60 , where the plane - wave modes are defined by their wavevector @xmath61 and polarization vector @xmath62 , with frequency given by @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the refraction index of the medium . substituting ( [ psil r - p ] ) in ( [ en foton linear ] ) , the energy can be written as @xmath65    the above hamiltonian is equivalent to the hamiltonian of a continuous set of harmonic oscillators @xcite , and the result of the second quantization procedure is to raise the `` dressed photon '' wave function to the status of a field operator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the annihilation operator for photons in the mode @xmath68 that , together with the creation operators @xmath69 , obey the commutation relations @xmath70=[\\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}s}^\\dag,\\hat{a}^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k}'s'}]=0,\\;\\ ;      [ \\hat{a}_{\\mathbf{k}s},\\hat{a}^\\dag_{\\mathbf{k}'s'}]=\\delta^3(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}')\\delta_{ss'}.\\ ] ] according to ( [ e - psil ] ) and ( [ b - psil ] ) , the electric and magnetic fields also become operators ) from ( [ b - psil ] ) , we must use the fact that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a polarization vector with helicity @xmath73 . this can be verified choosing @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ] : @xmath77 @xmath78+\\;\\mathrm{h.c.}.\\ ] ]    equations ( [ op e ] ) and ( [ op b ] ) for the electric and magnetic field operators are identical to the ones obtained with the traditional second quantization of the electromagnetic field in vacuum if we substitute @xmath43 by @xmath10 and @xmath44 by @xmath11 @xcite . in the treatment of smith and raymer for the quantization of the photon wave function in vacuum @xcite , the operator @xmath79 they find is equivalent to our @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is given by ( [ op psil r - p ] ) with @xmath82 .",
    "we believe that our form , in which @xmath81 has only annihilation operators , is more convenient , since it agrees with the condition @xmath83 derived from ( [ psil ] ) .",
    "a one - photon state can be written as @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 representing the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the corresponding one - photon wave function is @xcite @xmath87 in agreement with ( [ psil r - p ] ) .",

    "note that the wave function is automatically symmetrized via the term @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "the extension to higher dimensions is straightforward .",
    "here we want to find the behavior of the operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 from ( [ op e ] ) and ( [ op b ] ) when , besides the linear medium with electric and magnetic susceptibilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 occupying all space , there is another medium in a finite region with different properties . our treatment can be seen as an approximation of keller s treatment for the photon scattering @xcite in the far - field regime . applying the second quantization procedure including the interaction with matter , the operators @xmath79 will obey the same wave equation ( [ eq onda mat ] ) as the wave functions @xmath93 .",
    "so the operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 will also obey ( [ max ph 1 ] ) and ( [ max ph 2 ] ) . equation ( [ max ph 2 ] ) can be written in the following way @xmath94 where @xmath95-\\frac{\\partial(\\chi_\\mathrm{e}{\\mathbf{e}})}{\\partial t}\\ ] ] contain terms due to the difference of the behavior of the scattering medium in relation to the quantization medium , according to ( [ j clas ] ) . because the current density @xmath96 is a function of the electric and magnetic fields , when the fields become operators @xmath97",
    "also becomes an operator .",
    "differentiating ( [ max ph 2 b ] ) with respect to time , using ( [ max ph 1 ] ) and the vectorial identity @xmath98 , we obtain a wave equation for the operator @xmath91 : @xmath99 the above equation is a wave equation in which @xmath100 is the source .",
    "an analog equation can be found for the operator @xmath92 in a similar way : @xmath101    solutions of ( [ eq onda source e ] ) can be obtained using green functions @xcite . if we want to study the scattering of a photon in a known state in the paraxial regime , where the dependence of the polarization with the propagation direction can be disregarded and a scalar theory may be used , the relevant solutions of ( [ eq onda source e ] ) for the operator @xmath102 are @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 .    integrating ( [ g ] ) in @xmath106 , we see that the green functions can be written as @xmath107 it can also be shown , by a direct integration on the variables @xmath108 and @xmath109 in spherical coordinates @xmath110 @xcite , that @xmath111}=g^{(+)}(\\mathbf{r},t;\\mathbf{r}',t')-g^{(-)}(\\mathbf{r},t;\\mathbf{r}',t').\\ ] ] if we are studying the scattering of a photon , the observation time @xmath112 will always be greater than the time of the interaction @xmath113 .",

    ", we can use the same equation substituting the operator by the electric field of the photons , obtaining equivalent results to the scattering of an electromagnetic wave , since ( [ psi out ] ) is obtained from the maxwell equations .",
    "but the interesting results come from the treatment of problems that can not be obtained from classical electrodynamics . in the next section",
    ", we will apply the treatment to the scattering of a photon by a non - linear medium that can generate a photon pair in an entangled state .",
    "we will show that the quantum state of the generated photon pair we obtain is the same as the one previously obtained @xcite , but with a more intuitive interpretation .",
    "the parametric down conversion corresponds to the conversion of one incident photon in two by a non - linear birefringent crystal . as an example of application of the formalism developed in the previous section",
    ", we will calculate the quantum state of the photon pair generated in the process of type - i parametric down conversion , in which both generated photons have polarization orthogonal to the incident photon . to simplify the treatment",
    ", we will consider that the non - linear crystal is immersed in a medium with the same linear responses as the crystal .",
    "so the medium where the field is quantized occupies all space , and the non - linearities of the crystal will be responsible for the scattering processes .",
    "the magnetic responses of these crystals are very small , so we can consider a refraction index @xmath116 .",
    "we will also disregard the dependence of the refraction index with the propagation direction and the effects of dispersion .",
    "these approximations are consistent with the observation of photons at small angles in relation to the propagation direction of the incident photon and to the use of interference filters on the detectors , post - selecting states with relatively narrow frequency spectra .    with all these considerations ,",
    "the non - linear components of the polarization of the crystal can be written as @xmath117 where terms beyond the second order were disregarded . in type - i",
    "parametric down conversion , the generated photons have ordinary polarization and the incident photon has extraordinary polarization .",
    "according to ( [ j clas ] ) , the non - linear current density associated with the ordinary polarization can be written as @xmath118 , and the scattering term , according to ( [ eq onda source e ] ) , is @xmath119 .",
    "so the relevant source term for the scattering in ( [ psi out ] ) is @xmath120,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) denotes extraordinary ( ordinary ) polarization and we have @xmath123 , since @xmath124 and @xmath125 are operators that act on modes with orthogonal polarization and therefore commute .",
    "according to ( [ funcao onda 2 fotons ] ) , if we denote the state of the incident photon by @xmath126 , the two - photon component with ordinary polarization of the output state is @xmath127 considering a first order scattering , in which one of the operators @xmath128 above is substituted via ( [ op psil - e o ] ) by the scattered electric field of ( [ psi out ] ) and the other is kept with the non - scattered field , we can write @xmath129 , that correctly symmetrizes the wave function . from now on we will omit this permutation term to simplify the notation .",
    "the refraction index @xmath130 appears in the above equation because we have @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 is given by ( [ psi out ] ) , with @xmath100 given by ( [ f cpd ] ) .",

    "so the term @xmath142 in the above equation may be substituted by @xmath143 .",

    "the incident photon generates a pair of photons in spherical wave modes emitted from each non - linear scatterer . the energy and momentum conservation in the process",
    "may be seen as consequences of the fundamental indistinguishability of all possible instants of time and positions in which a photon pair could be generated , which forces us to coherently add all the probability amplitudes .",
    "these probability amplitudes interfere destructively when energy is not conserved .",
    "however , although the sum of the energies of the twin photons is the energy of the incident photon , the energy of each photon can assume a wide range of values .",
    "so , the photon pair is highly entangled in energy .",
    "the probability amplitudes also interfere making the sum of the momenta of the twin photons be associated with the momentum of the incident photon , depending on the crystal geometry since the crystal may absorb part of the momentum in the process .",
    "the momentum of each photon can also assume a wide range of values , so the generated photons are also entangled in linear momentum .    comparing ( [ estado cpd ] ) and ( [ funcao onda 2 fotons ] ) , we see that the post - selected wave function of the twin photons on the wavevector space is proportional to @xmath145 let us consider that the incident photon is in a beam mode that propagates in the @xmath146 direction and that the crystal is a rectangular box with dimensions much larger than the beam waist in the @xmath147 and @xmath148 directions and a small width in the @xmath149 direction .",
    "let us also treat the collinear regime , in which the crystal is oriented to maximize the production of photons with wavevectors near the @xmath146 direction .",
    "so the integrals in @xmath147 and @xmath148 in ( [ 2photon wavenumber ] ) may be extended to infinity and the integral in @xmath149 results in a constant . to illustrate the energy and momentum entanglement of the state ,",
    "let us represent the vectors @xmath61 as @xmath150 and @xmath151 as @xmath152 , since @xmath153 and @xmath154 determine @xmath155 .",
    "let us also substitute the integral in the @xmath146 component of @xmath156 by an integral in @xmath153 . with all these approximations ,",
    "the integral in @xmath113 gives @xmath157 and the integrals on @xmath158 and @xmath159 give @xmath160 .",
    "so the 2-photon wave function on wavevector space can be written within the paraxial domain ( @xmath161 ) as @xcite @xmath162 we can not write this wave function as a product of a wave function for photon 1 and a wave function for photon 2 , what characterizes the entanglement of the state in both energy and momentum .",
