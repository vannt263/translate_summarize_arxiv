    "the yield ( per input mixed state ) in the case of asymptotic data is given by @xcite @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the standard binary shannon entropy function , @xmath73 is the phase shift error rate corresponding to the stabilizer generator @xmath74 , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the bit flip error rates corresponding to the stabilizer generator @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "one can choose two ( classical ) random hashing codes , one of which is used to correct bit flip errors and the other one is used to correct phase errors .",
    "this can be done by local operation and classical communication with the help of multilateral quantum xor operations .",

    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined as the bit flip error rates between alice and bob s bits and between alice and charlie s bits in @xmath3 basis corresponding to the stabilizer generator @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , which can be obtained from eq .",
    "and eq .   as , @xmath83 we employ the bit error rate @xmath84 to represent the probability that all the bit values of alice , bob and charlie are not the same , @xmath85 the phase shift error rate corresponding to the stabilizer generator @xmath74 in @xmath3 basis can be given by @xmath86 furthermore , if alice , bob and charlie measure the ghz state in @xmath8 basis , the random measurement outcomes will always share a binary correlation @xmath87 .",

    ", we suggest a possible way to implement phase compensation over a distance to enable the distribution of the common phase reference among all users .",
    "alice , bob and charlie exploit continuous - wave laser sources with the same central wavelength and narrow line - width to generate continuous - wave laser with almost stabilized phases .",
    "the amplitude modulator generates reference light and signal light .",
    "the reference light is used for phase compensation , while the signal light is used for encoding qubits .",
    "when three reference lights with positive @xmath191 polarization and same intensity enter the ghz - analyzer , the ghz - analyzer will unambiguously reveal whether the phases among them are the same or not @xcite , i.e. , detector d1h and d1v compare the phases between alice and bob , detector d2h and d2v compare the phases between bob and charlie , detector d3h and d3v compare the phases between alice and charlie , respectively .",
    "thus , with the detection results corresponding to reference light , one can realize the phase compensation , resulting in a common phase reference among all users . considering the scattering effects in fiber",
    ", the reference light should not be too strong , so as to reduce the detrimental scattering effects .",
    "another approach could be to use wavelength division multiplexing with the frequency of reference light less than that of signal light so that the detrimental scattered photons can be filtered out . as seen from fig .  1 in the supplemental material of ref @xcite",
    ", practically the phase drift is about @xmath192 per second for 100 km standard single - mode fiber ( smf-28 ) , so rapid feedback algorithm is necessary for implementing long distance phase compensation .",
    "there are some rapid feedback algorithms realizing phase - stabilization for several kilometers @xcite . however , successfully accomplishing long distance ( 100 km ) phase - stabilization is still challenging under current technology .    it should be noted that the inclusion of phase post - selection complicates the security analysis , as pointed out in the context of device - independent qkd @xcite or mdi - qkd @xcite .",
    "the rigorous security of mdi - qss with weak coherent states and phase post - selection thus needs more investigations , too .      except for the phase post - selection technique",
    ", we propose another two methods to perform mdi - qss : the triggered spontaneous parametric down conversion sources , or the conventional weak coherent state sources together with the quantum non - demolition measurement technique . instead of taking advantage of weak coherent states which are divided into two independent states after passing through a beam splitter , we use another universal method to process the joint quantum state evolution , which can also be used for any photon - number distribution ( including coherent states ) of the sources .",

    "while it is beyond the scope of the main text of the present paper to clarify the point , here we would like to argue that the proposed time - reversed ghz experiment enables the test of a particular form of the kochen - specker theorem @xcite as proposed by mermin @xcite .",
    "the usual bell theorem ( bell s inequalities and the ghz theorem ) has three independent assumptions @xcite : locality , realism and freedom of choices ( namely , the experimental setting choices are truly random and free ) .",
    "however , in the proposed time - reversed ghz experiment , we can suppose that alice , bob and charlie prepare their own single - photon states randomly either in the @xmath8 basis or in the @xmath59 basis ; as a proof - of - principle argument , we do not use the weak coherent light sources to avoid the experimental complication caused by the non - ideal light sources .",
    "the three single photons are then subject to the ghz measurement at david s station .",
    "the measurements and the preparations of these single photons can not be spacelike - separated .",
    "then we immediately see that the proposed time - reversed ghz experiment does not test local realism . instead",
    ", we argue that what it actually tests is the kochen - specker theorem as proposed by mermin for the case of eight - dimensional space of three spins / qubits @xcite .",
    "the kochen - specker theorem states that quantum mechanical predictions for any systems of dimensions 3 or higher can not be reproduced by noncontextual hidden - variable theories that assume the measurement results to be predetermined and independent of other compatible measurements . in mermin",
    "s argument of the kochen - specker theorem , one makes use of a set of the operator identities : @xmath250 where @xmath251 is used to separate operators or operator products .",
    "mermin s argument of the kochen - specker theorem is a state - independent proof . in the present time - reversed ghz experiment",
    ", we only identify one ( @xmath123 ) out of the eight ghz states .",
    "thus , for quantum mechanics to interpret the experiment , we have the following eigenequations @xmath252    how to interpret eq .   by noncontextual hidden - variable theories ? according to mermin @xcite , each of operators or operator products ( denoted by @xmath253 ) separated by @xmath251 can be assigned a predetermined value @xmath254 .",
    "thus the noncontextual hidden - variable theories predict the following relations among these predetermined values : @xmath255 since @xmath256 , multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "yields @xmath257 , which is a conflict .",
    "the conflict implies that it is impossible to interpret the experiment by assuming the predetermined values to these operators or operator productions .",
    "there is a trick that the predetermined values of the four operator productions , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , appear either separately in the first to fourth lines of eq .  , or jointly in the last line of eq .",
    "for the above argument to be valid , either one has to make an additional assumption ( e.g. , measurements of the four operator productions do not disturb each other ) or one has to be able to measure the four operator productions with the same apparatus .",
    "a similar argument is essential in a ghz - like refutation of local realism using two - photon hyperentanglement @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in the present case we can avoid the additional assumption also by measuring the four operator productions by the same apparatus , which is exactly the apparatus for the ghz - state measurement .",
    "the above reasoning is valid for ideal cases , namely , one has @xmath256 exactly and perfect detections . for practical experiments",
    ", we have mermin s inequality by noting that we only identify @xmath123 out of the eight ghz states .    as we noted in section i.b , in the security proof of our multiparty quantum communication protocols",
    ", we suppose that each of alice , bob and charlie has an epr entangled state which contains one virtual qubit in each of them and the `` signal '' qubit is sent to the middle node , david . after a successful ghz - state measurement performed by david , the virtual qubit of the legitimate users becomes a ghz - entangled state . this procedure is known as a multiparty entanglement swapping . if we suppose that each of alice , bob and charlie possesses two epr - entangled photons , rather than the virtual+signal qubits , a successful ghz - state measurement by david would result in three - photon ghz entanglement . the ghz entanglement created this way can be used to demonstrate the violation of local realism as usual provided that the measurements performed by alice , bob , charlie and david are spacelike separated .",
    "such an experiment can even be performed in a delayed - choice version , as demonstrated for the case of two qubits both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite ."

    "<S> , tremendous efforts have been dedicated to increase the transmission distance of quantum communication between _ two _ legitimate users . </S>",
    "<S> the recorded distance for qkd has been more than 300 km for standard telecom fiber links @xcite , while quantum teleportation has been demonstrated over a distance of more than 100 km for free - space channels @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , most theoretical and experimental works on quantum communication are focused on two - party protocols . yet , multiparty quantum communication protocols do exist , as illustrated by the fascinating examples like quantum cryptographic conferencing ( qcc ) bose:1998:multiparticle , chen:2007:multi - pattite , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite and third - man quantum cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these multiparty protocols require an important resource  the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entangled states @xcite with perfect multiparty quantum correlations , which are originally introduced to reveal the extreme violation of local realism against quantum mechanics . nevertheless , the practical applications of ghz states are quite limited due to the lack of two important factors  the high - intensity source and remote reliable distribution of the ghz states . </S>",
    "<S> the existing experimental works tittel:2001:exp : chen:2005:qss : gaertner:2007:exp : schmid : exp:2005 on multiparty quantum communication remain the proof - of - principle demonstration and reported rather low key rates . the experimental distribution of the ghz entanglement @xcite was achieved only recently , over a distance of less than 1 km for each party of the ghz - entangled photons . </S>",

    "<S> the classical bit information corresponds to the information denoted by different overall phase regions over @xmath42 ( the phase post - selection technique ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , we assume the gain and bit error rate of single - photon states to be in a uniform distribution over @xmath42 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a method for distributing such a phase reference is suggested in supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the rigorous security of protocols involving phase post - selection technique needs more investigations in the contexts of both qkd @xcite and mdi - qss .    to analyze the performance of the secret key rates of mdi - qcc and mdi - qss , we present an analytical method with two decoy states to estimate the relevant parameters @xmath25 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath26 , which are required to be evaluated in eqs .  - . in our simulation , we employ the following experimental parameters : the intrinsic loss coefficient @xmath47 of the standard telecom fiber channel is @xmath48 db / km . for the threshold single - photon detectors , the detection efficiency @xmath49 , and the background count rate @xmath50 , as used in a recent decoy - state mdi - qkd experiment @xcite . as a comparison </S>",

    "<S> the secure transmission distance is about @xmath57 km for the detection efficiency of @xmath54 ( @xmath58 km for the detection efficiency of @xmath56 ) between the middle node and any user .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:3 ] over the distribution distance of about @xmath65 km from david to alice ( bob , charlie ) ; more details can be found in the supplemental material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that high - quality ghz entanglement can be generated at this distance by the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed protocol can be regarded as a variance of the usual ghz experiment testing local realism , namely , a time - reversed ghz experiment where the state preparations replace the state measurements in the usual ghz test . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of such a variance and , particularly , its relevance to the test of hidden - variable theories are interesting in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> we argue in the supplemental material @xcite that such an experiment tests mermin s argument @xcite on the kochen - specker theorem @xcite .    in summary , we propose a feasible protocol for distributing the post - selected ghz entanglement and mdi multiparty quantum communication over a distance of more than 100 km for experimentally accessible parameter regimes . combining the decoy - state and mdi protocols for qkd , we show that the information - theoretically secure mdi - qcc with the conventional weak coherent state sources can be implemented over a distance of about @xmath53 km , as well as the mdi - qss with weak coherent sources based on phase post - selection technique over a distance of about @xmath57 km . these distances are significantly beyond what one could expect previously for multiparty quantum communication with the ghz entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal thus suggests an important avenue for practical long - distance multiparty quantum communication . </S>",
