    "resonant electron transfer during sputtering of atoms and molecules from metal surfaces has been a very interesting subject in relation to secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) where the knowledge of ionization and neutralization rates is essential for many quantitative analyses .",
    "the theory of such processes should encompass a detailed description of charge exchanges in the collision cascade to the outgoing atom or atomic cluster .",
    "in fact , to make this complicated problem tractable , a basic model has been formulated in terms of a single orbital parametrically time - dependent anderson - newns hamiltonian @xcite-@xcite , in which the effects of the bombardment , including the substrate motion , the electronic excitations generated and the physical and chemical consequences of the void produced by the ejected particle have been neglected .",
    "many experimental results have been reproduced in this way @xcite-@xcite which is common to both sims and atomic surface scattering . yet the need for a more comprehensive theory of surface influences in sputtering has led to a generalized approach @xcite in which the substrate dynamics have been modeled with locally time - dependent perturbations created during the collision and acting within the first layers of the surface region . in a first simplified treatment @xcite a one - body time dependent scattering potential , localized in the vicinity of the emission site , was added to the basic hamiltonian and _ direct _ ( i.e. non mediated by the atomic localized level ) electronic excitations , created in the conduction band by this new term , were explicitly considered in the evaluation of the ionized fraction . although the average lifetime of these excitations is believed to be rather short on the time - scale of the emission trajectory @xcite , their contribution to the final charge state of secondary ions becomes important at very low emission energies where the ionization probability calculated from the basic theory exhibits an exponential dependence on the inverse of the _ average _ outgoing velocity of sputtered particles @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", an exact formal solution of the two potential problem formulated in ref.@xcite has been obtained confirming more rigorously that , in the velocity regime typically observed in many sims experiments , the basic hopping mechanism may be negligible with respect to surface induced excitations , at least if they can be represented in the form of a one - body scattering potential . in the present article , we have proposed a more accurate form of the sputtering potential combining the above mentioned impurity scattering contribution with a hopping resonant interaction due to a second discrete state embedded in the conduction band ( sec.2 ) .",
    "both perturbations are essentially generated in the quasi - molecules ( qm ) formed _ transiently _ in the collision cascade , between substrate and emitted atoms , and the latter has been already used in a different context concerning the analysis of electronic emission from a bombarded metal substrate @xcite .",
    "the reference hamiltonian is quadratic in electron creation and annihilation operators , which would make the problem trivially soluble in the absence of time - dependent interactions . nevertheless , in the present treatment",
    ", only a formal expression can be given to the exact evolution of the localized orbital on the ejected particle .",
    "we have performed this step by using retarded green s functions thus parameterizing the evolution of the atomic state in terms of feynmann diagrams ( sec.3 ) .",
    "assumptions of the slow , non adiabatic dynamics , i.e. brako and newns approach @xcite , plus an approximation due to the transient nature of the qm , has allowed us to obtain a manageable expression for multiple interaction transition amplitudes involved in the problem ( sec.4 ) .",
    "we have generalized former results @xcite , with particular attention to the dependence of the ionization probability on the final emission velocity of the outgoing ion , including thermal interactions .",
    "we have also proposed a comparison of our predictions with previously published theoretical calculations @xcite and applied them to a well known sputtering experiment @xcite .",
    "the generalized model is sketched in fig.1 .",
    "the metal is treated as a fermi gas specified by a set of continuous states @xmath1 and spectrum @xmath2 with work function @xmath3 .",
    "the fermi energy has been set to @xmath4 in an appropriate scale with the _ vacuum _ fixed to zero .",
    "the multiple index @xmath5 runs over single particle energies and all the degeneracies of each level .",
    "in addition , because of impurities , adatoms and surface defects , it may include discrete quantum numbers .",
    "the outward atom is assumed to move along a classical trajectory and have a non degenerate valence level @xmath6 lying within the metal conduction band .",
    "the corresponding valence state is indicated by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 may be an _ affinity level _",
    "( @xmath9 ) as well as an _ ionization level _ ( @xmath10 ) which give rise , respectively , to negative and positive ionization .",
    "an electron can tunnel between the atomic level and a continuous state @xmath11 with a coupling strength given by the hopping integrals @xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "particle exchange with the continuum dominates in a range of the order of the virtual _ broadening _ of the localized state @xmath14 ,    \\label{eq:2.1}\\ ] ] which is proportional to the first order transition rate of all occupation channels @xmath15 , i.e fermi s golden rule @xcite .",
    "anderson - newns potential causes an _ indirect _ production of electron - hole pairs by processes @xcite of the kind shown in fig.2a .",
    "other excitation channels are induced by _",
    "transient perturbations _ generated during the collision process . in relation with the schematic of fig.3 , we observe that the majority of low energy atoms are emitted because of _ indirect binary collisions _ with substrate atoms that have received a sudden impulse in the collision cascade and the number of ejections caused by _ direct collision _ with primary ions may be neglected . for this reason , we consider secondary emitted atoms to form quasi molecular systems with recoiling substrate atoms moving within the surface region . with this mechanism",
    "an electron may be _ trapped _ , as illustrated in fig.4 , into a transient _ molecular orbital _ ( mo ) which may be promoted to the conduction band as a result of the increasing nuclear charge in the qm with decreasing internuclear distance and the increase in kinetic energy of the electron with its increased localization .",
    "thus the hopping interaction of this state with the continuum can be very important at low incident energies when the qm has a longer average lifetime .",
    "in addition , since translational invariance is broken down both by the substrate and secondary atomic motion , many scattering transitions occur in the conduction band together with electronic emissions .",
    "in this paper we have limited our investigation to the influence of a single promoted state @xmath16 , with energy @xmath17 in resonance with the conduction band , interacting through a second hopping potential , specified by matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with the continuum .",
    "this mo may be either a metastable configuration of the outgoing atomic state or distinct from the atomic state itself , depending on the energy position of the localized levels of the two atoms involved in its formation .",
    "let us denote by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the classical position vectors of the substrate and emitted atoms in the qm , respectively , as measured from a reference frame placed at the surface .",
    "because of the slow motion of the atomic cores on the electronic time - scale , @xmath22 and @xmath23 introduce two large characteristic times , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , over which many electronic transitions occur . moreover , since the substrate recoling atom in the qm , see fig.3 , is more energetic than the emitted atom and follows a complicated path inside the metal , we may take @xmath26 .    in order to construct the second quantization hamiltonian of the problem we consider a single electron of the system , with kinetic energy @xmath27 , @xmath28 being its momentum operator , in the surface barrier of the metal @xmath29 , with @xmath30 its orthogonal coordinate operator , and in the screened coulomb field @xmath31 + v_{c}\\left [   \\vec{\\mathrm{r}}-\\vec{x}\\left ( t\\right )   \\right]$ ] , of the atomic cores in the qm , with @xmath32 its position operator .",
    "such a particle is also subject , at large distance form the surface , to the potential of its image charge and of those of the screened nuclei at @xmath33 . denoting with @xmath34 $ ] the sum of these three contributions , we can write the first quantization hamiltonian of the particle as @xmath35   + v_{c}\\left [   \\vec{\\mathrm{r}}- \\vec{x}\\left ( t\\right )   \\right ]   + v_{i}\\left [   \\vec{\\mathrm{r}};\\vec{y}\\left(t\\right ) , \\vec{x}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right ] ,                 \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq.oeham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where atomic units have been used",
    "next , we define the continuous conduction states @xmath1 as eigenstates of the unperturbed surface hamiltonian @xmath36 , with spectrum @xmath37 . because of the surface barrier",
    ", the corresponding wave functions @xmath38 drop to zero outside the surface , i.e. at @xmath39 , after some atomic distances .",
    "the adiabatic state @xmath40 is obtained by translating the stationary state @xmath41 , for an electron localized on an atomic nucleus fixed at the surface , to the position of the emitted atom .",
    "hence it diagonalizes instantaneously the hamiltonian @xmath42 $ ] , with a time independent eigenvalue @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) .",
    "the atomic wave function depends on @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . as for @xmath47 , it can be calculated by solving the eigenvalue equation for the qm hamiltonian @xmath48 + v_{c}\\left [   \\vec{\\mathrm{r}}-\\vec{x}\\left ( t\\right )   \\right ] , \\ ] ] viz .",
    "@xmath49 , through the lcao method .",
    "the set of normalized states @xmath50 is well defined and can be used as a truncated basis to describe the problem , once the overlap contributions @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 have been neglected for all @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we can introduce the electron destruction @xmath55 and creation operators @xmath56 , in schrdinger s picture , satisfying algebraic relations @xmath57 with @xmath58 the anticommutation operator and @xmath59 electron number operators .",
    "these may be chosen to be approximately time - independent by an appropriate phase transformation on @xmath40 and @xmath60 and the many - body system hamiltonian @xcite is    @xmath61    here the atomic and molecular unperturbed energies , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are shifted in presence of the interactions to @xmath64   + v_{s}\\left ( z\\right )   + v_{i}\\left [   \\mathrm{\\vec{r}};\\vec{y}\\left(t\\right ) , \\vec{x}\\left ( t\\right )   \\right ]   \\biggr\\ } \\left| a\\left ( t\\right)\\right\\rangle    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "non anderson - newns terms enhance the number of electron - hole excitations by processes similar to those reported in figs.2b and 2c .",
    "moreover in the reference hamiltonian we have not allowed direct transitions between the two localized states , regarding terms like @xmath68 as small perturbations in the energy scale of the hopping interactions .",
    "we point out that the introduction of the qm contribute in the determination of the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath69 that , unlike the bare model @xcite , depend parametrically on both the outgoing and recoiled atomic trajectories .",

    "however while the qm is present many electronic exchanges , see figs.2b and 2c , occur that may influence the final charge state of the sputtered atom .",
    "a very important topic is concerned with the question weather the two discrete states are so much linked that @xmath72 may transform into @xmath73 , in the first step of the emission process , during the action of the short range atom - atom forces , or if they can be considered distinct and non overlapping . in our opinion , the former case can occur when the energies @xmath8 and @xmath74 are so close , at the time of ejection , viz .",
    "@xmath75 , that one of the atomic states , localized at @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , in which @xmath76 may be decomposed , in the lcao scheme , is @xmath77 itself . anyway , even in this eventuality , we can continue to use the model hamiltonian of eq.([eq:2.2 ] ) , assigning to the state @xmath78 the role of a discrete atomic state localized on the substrate atom of the qm and transiently forming a mo with the state @xmath79 in the time interval @xmath80 .",
    "apart from this conceptual correction no significant qualitative or quantitative changes affect the ionized fraction in the emitted beam , at least within the limits of our approximations .",
    "hence , in the following , we shall consider @xmath81 to be independent from @xmath73 , regarding a more accurate study of correlations between the two discrete states to future works .",
    "the purpose of our analysis is to find out the fraction of atoms detected at the end of the process with a given charge state . in our model",
    "this calculation is straightforward once we have determined @xmath82 in the final system configuration , when the particle is quite far from the sample and the perturbations are switched off , i.e. @xmath83 . the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) describes atomic emission only _ after _",
    "the collision has taken place hence the initial condition should be referred to the time when the atom is at the surface . for analytical simplicity",
    "we prefer to place the initial time in the remote past and switch on adiabatically the perturbations as in an ion - surface scattering problem .",
    "it has been argued that this analytical continuation on negative times does not infer the treatment for many systems , such as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that interaction terms obey the following @xmath85 the neutral fraction of emitted particles at a temperature @xmath86 is defined as the thermal average of the atomic electron number operator , evolved to the remote future according to heisenberg s scheme , in the initial equilibrium configuration , or @xmath87 here , spin degrees of freedom have been ignored as coulomb intra - atomic correlation terms @xcite do not explicitly appear in the reference hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation limits the applicability of the model to very simple ejected beams such as alkalis @xcite , and , even in this case , there are non trivial problems at least for the atomic orbital .",
    "in fact , while the emitted atom moves off surface , the state @xmath88 increases its localization , the hopping mechanism becoming weaker , and approaches the atomic limit , when the exchange of electron with the surface becomes a spin - flip process without charge fluctuation @xcite , which can not be described by a spinless theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath89 acts sensibly on the system only when the emitted atom is in the vicinity of the surface so that its correlation energy may be taken to be infinite , in the scale of hopping interaction strengths , avoiding double occupation of the level .",
    "some significative efforts in a better comprehension of spin correlations have been made , in the last decade , on the bare anderson - newns model , see for instance refs.@xcite .",
    "however further studies are needed to discuss the influence of the two - body spin - spin potential in the framework of the present approach .",
    "thus , in this analytical derivation , the spin degeneracy can be taken into account only by addiction of a @xmath90 , premultiplying eq.([eq.3.4 ] ) , at the end of calculations .",
    "complementarily to eq.([eq.3.4 ] ) the ionized fraction can be put in the form @xmath91 our evaluation of ( [ eq.3.4 ] ) and ( [ eq.3.4b ] ) are based on the equations of motion method @xcite .",
    "electron operators obey the following set of coupled equations @xmath92 that can be easily written down by using the algebraic relations of eq.([eq.2.3 ] ) extended , in heisenberg s picture , at all equal times .",

    "inclusion of temperatures , by eqs.([important ] ) and ( [ eq.10.4]),allows us to conclude that , at least in the limit of our model , surface effects are somewhat less sensitive to thermal interactions than anderson - newns hopping mechanism . in fig.7 we have reported the functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath86 , for an emission energy of the order of @xmath223 ev , a binding energy of @xmath268 ev , i.e. @xmath269 ev , by numerically integrating eq.([important ] ) , the gray line corresponding to the analytical solution of eq.([eq.10.4 ] ) . the energy separation @xmath264 has been set to @xmath270 ev , typical of cu@xmath266/cu sputtering , and the range of validity of the analytical result ( [ eq.10.4 ] ) increases , from @xmath271 k to @xmath272 k , with increasing @xmath273 ( it must be noted anyway that when @xmath274 ev or @xmath275 ev the slowness approximation can be hardly applied , @xmath276 being of the order of @xmath277 ) . as shown in fig.8 , eq.([eq.61bnh ] ) varies over several orders of magnitude with increasing temperature while eq.([eq.10.4 ] ) undergoes small variations , within one order of magnitude ( see also fig.7 ) . on the other hand the latter is strongly influenced by changes in the characteristic energy @xmath236 .",
    "we note that , at high temperatures , above @xmath278 k , @xmath0 is mainly determined by the basic anderson - newns model , even in the low @xmath279-region , while in the interval @xmath280 k , for @xmath281 ev , qm interactions are competitive with the former .",
    "it should also be observed that the limit of validity of eq.([eq.34bn ] ) is not strictly respected below @xmath282 k , which would mean that the result form the basic mechanism , reported in the above mentioned figure , is over - estimated .",
    "on the other hand our result eq.([important ] ) can be applied at all temperatures , provided that resonant charge - exchange through the mo is the leading process .",
    "inclusion of thermal interactions attests that the two results here discussed are not so dramatically different as the zero temperature theory would suggest . in this prospective",
    ", it seems an important task for future studies to analyze more quantitatively correlations between these behaviors , devoting much attention to all the contributions appearing in eq.([eq.6.1 ] ) and , particularly , to the perturbed self - energy of eq.([eq.pse ] ) .",
    "to conclude we observe that finding a power law dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath239 , observed in much experimental work @xcite , is still an open theoretical problem . from the scarce contribution found in literature",
    "it looks evident that the sole resonant interaction of the atomic state with metal electrons is not sufficient to obtain such a behavior . in refs.@xcite",
    "a solution of the form @xmath283 has been obtained through the introduction of an effective substrate temperature into a semiclassical master equation for @xmath284 , while in refs.@xcite the result @xmath285 has been proposed as solution of an anderson - newns hamiltonian in the screened scattering potential of a moving source localized at atomic distances from the surface .",
    "these papers have provided the grounds from the present analysis , in which non anderson interaction have been more accurately modeled by the transient qm . a different approach @xcite , taking into consideration the screening of the nucleus field of a sputtered atom by electrons simultaneously tunneling in its vicinity through the potential barrier ( see figs.4 ) ,",
    "has yield a velocity dependence of the form @xmath286 . in the same paper ,",
    "the author has pointed out that the formula does not hold at high emission energies . in the present work ,",
    "we have explained the different behavior of eqs.([important ] ) , ( [ eq.61bnh ] ) and eqs.([eq.10.5]),([eq.34bn ] ) , in the framework of the same model , as depending on the energy received by the sputtered particle in the collision cascade . on the contrary , in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the two results are presented in relation to the use of two different approaches , the simultaneous resonant tunneling and the anderson - newns , the second of which is put in doubt because of the low @xmath239 features of @xmath0 .",
    "our study attests the correctness of this latter , in its bare form , providing an implementation that may explain some incongruencies with experiments in the critical low @xmath239 region at low - medium temperatures .",
    "finally , it is worth to mention that a hamiltonian resembling eq.([eq:2.2 ] ) , with two nearly stationary and directly interacting atomic states , has been used in a few different contexts . in ref.@xcite",
    "a similar model has been applied to the study of resonant charge transfer of scattering proton from an adsorbate - covered metal surface . there",
    "the authors have modeled different atomic dynamics , regarding the substrate atom as fixed , thus allowing sensible overlapping between the atomic states , and have calculated the ionization coefficient as function of the characteristic time of emission , here denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the analytical derivation has been made on an effective anderson - newns hamiltonian obtained by a canonical transformation , thus formally eliminating the second discrete state , and compared to simulations .",
    "it can be easily shown that the ionization probability of ref.@xcite , once coupling terms between the discrete states have been switched off , reduces to a particular case of eq.([eq.6.1 ] ) , of the presnt paper , provided that the substrate atom remains fixed , i.e @xmath287,@xmath288 ( or @xmath289 ) and , consequently , @xmath290 are approximately time - independent . then by the same methods employed in sec.4 one can obtain eq.([eq.10.4 ] ) in the @xmath291 limit . in refs.@xcite",
    "the two state model is used to explain the modification of singlet excited states @xmath292 and @xmath293 of @xmath294 interacting with an @xmath295 surface .",
    "the problem is approached through the introduction of an effective @xmath296 , non hermitian hamiltonian @xcite , in the basis of the two , strongly coupled , discrete states , in which the non hermitian terms take into account the interaction with the continuum .    in this paper , we have integrated the reference hamiltonian of two weakly coupled quasi - stationary states directly under the slowness hypothesis and we have proposed a manageable expression for the ionization probability that can be easily compared with the well known result from the basic theory .",
    "thus we have estimated the influence of the new mechanism providing plausible arguments that substrate excitations produced by the primary ion bombardment during sputtering can , in some cases , alter the final charge - state of emitted particles .",
