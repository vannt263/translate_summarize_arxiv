    "the nominal valence of bi is 4 + , leaving a single @xmath3-electron per bi atom .",
    "if babio@xmath0 had perfect cubic perovskite symmetry , then ( in independent electron picture , or band theory ) it would be metallic , with the fermi level half into a broad band made of bi @xmath4 electrons ( partially antibonded with o @xmath5 states . ) the large size of the bi @xmath4 orbital indicates that single - electron ( band ) approximation should be good @xcite",
    ". therefore the origin of insulating behavior should lie in the structural distortions which double the unit cell .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that babio@xmath0 is a prototype d=3 peierls insulator with a simple lattice dimerization .",
    "babio@xmath0 can be hole - doped by pb substitution for bi or k substitution for ba . at a quite high critical concentration @xmath6 of holes per cell ( @xmath7 for pb or @xmath8 for k ) , an insulator to metal transition occurs , with the metal a superconductor .",
    "the high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath9 30k ) is compatible with a conventional electron - phonon mechanism , but neither theory @xcite nor spectroscopy @xcite is able to make a convincing confirmation .",
    "electron - phonon effects certainly play an important role in the insulating part of the phase diagram .",
    "this paper explores the self - trapped polarons which occur at low doping and which provide the most plausible mechanism explaining how these materials remain insulating to such high hole concentrations @xmath6 .",
    "we use a simple and yet fairly realistic model @xcite which gives a microscopic description of the peierls distortion .",
    "the model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "there is one electronic degree of freedom per bi atom , the amplitude of the @xmath4 electron orbital at that site , with corresponding creation operator @xmath10 .",
    "the index @xmath11 is a composite , standing for @xmath12 where the integer vector @xmath13 locates bi atoms on a cubic lattice of lattice constant @xmath14=4.28@xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the spin index .",
    "the bragg vector of the dimerized lattice is @xmath17 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , separates the simple cubic lattice into two sublattices , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 equal to 1 on @xmath20 and -1 on @xmath21 . the 6 nearest neighbors of each atom lie on the opposite sublattice .",
    "in each cell there are three vibrational degrees of freedom , the oxygen displacements along the bi - o bond directions .",
    "vibrations perpendicular to bond directions are assumed not to influence electrons .",
    "the oxygen displacements @xmath23 are labelled by indices @xmath24 which refer to the oxygen located at position @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient to define a local dilation or breathing amplitude @xmath26 on the @xmath27-th bi atom , @xmath28 \\label{eq : dilation}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the displacement of the oxygen atom at @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath31 is the same as @xmath23 , while @xmath32 is the same as @xmath33 , that is , it is the displacement of the oxygen atom located at @xmath34 relative to the bi atom @xmath27 . for a positive distortion @xmath26",
    ", the bi @xmath4 electron has its energy lowered by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the deformation potential .",
    "each oxygen displacement costs elastic energy @xmath37 . using the raman measurement of @xmath38=70 mev for the oxygen `` breathing mode '' @xcite",
    ", the value of @xmath39 is 19 ev/@xmath40 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath41 where the hopping summation index @xmath42 goes over each nearest neighbor pair both forward and backward , and conserves spin .",

    "later when non - adiabatic effects are treated , a new dimensionless energy ratio @xmath50 enters .",
    "because hopping goes only between inequivalent sublattices , the band energy has the symmetry property @xmath57 .",
    "the bands are symmetric around energy 0 , which is the fermi energy at half filling .",
    "there is perfect `` nesting '' at this value of the fermi energy , because for every state with @xmath58 , there is another state at wavevector @xmath59 which is also at the fermi energy .",
    "this perfect nesting property is an artifact of the nearest neighbor hopping , and is destroyed by next - neighbor hopping terms . because of perfect nesting , it is particularly simple to find the ground state of the undoped ( half - filled ) case , obtaining a bcs - like integral equation for the peierls gap @xmath60 , which has a solution @xmath61 for weak coupling ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this was discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the next section will treat this problem in the extreme atomic limit ( @xmath63 ) where a particularly simple approximation @xmath64 applies .",
    "an important consistency check on the hamiltonian is the fact that three parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath39 , and @xmath36 ) fit four independently determined properties of babio@xmath0 .",
    "the value @xmath36=1.39 ev/@xmath15 is chosen to yield a peierls band gap @xmath65 2 ev , agreeing with optical measurements @xcite .",
    "then the oxygen sublattice displacement @xmath66 is predicted by the model to be 0.12 @xmath15 , while experiment sees 0.09 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "our model hamiltonian contains a good explanation of the difficulty of making free carriers : doped - in holes self - localize , making small polarons and bipolarons . in a future paper we will re - examine the case of heavy doping , previously treated by yu , chen , and su @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on dilute doping .",
    "we have previously @xcite looked at the criteria for polaron formation in the case of dilute doping into an empty band ( no peierls distortion ) , as occurs in materials like basno@xmath0 .",
    "the critical coupling strength @xmath67 for polaron formation was found to be 1.96 , and @xmath68 for bipolaron formation was found to be 0.99 .",
    "we have also studied the case of dilute doping into the half - filled band by an analytic variational approximation @xcite .",
    "critical coupling strengths were dramatically reduced , to @xmath69 and @xmath70 . here",
    "we provide detailed numerical pictures of the behavior of lightly doped babio@xmath0 , including predictions about the optical spectrum . in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we examine the self - trapped exciton state which forms when undoped babio@xmath0 is excited optically .",
    "the value @xmath71 is appropriate for babio@xmath0 .",
    "this is intermediate between weak and strong coupling . beyond its applicability to babio@xmath0 , the model is intellectually interesting in its own right , and we can be curious how its behavior evolves with coupling constant @xmath72 over the whole range 0 to @xmath73 .",
    "we now solve the problem in the extreme atomic limit @xmath74 which just means that we ignore the hopping term ( @xmath75 ) , simplifying the mathematics greatly .",
    "the results yield insight into the intermediate region @xmath71 .",
    "when the bi @xmath3 level is half - filled , the strong - coupling solution consists of putting two electrons on each bi atom on the @xmath20 sublattice and no electrons on each bi atom on the @xmath21 sublattice .",
    "this is the extreme atomic limit of a peierls charge density wave .",
    "the paired electrons can be given various names : `` bipolarons '' or `` negative @xmath76 centers . ''",
    "the mechanism stabilizing these objects is oxygen motion .",
    "each oxygen has as nearest neighbors one @xmath20 and one @xmath21 sublattice bi atom .",
    "therefore it experiences a force away from the more negative @xmath20 site and toward the more positive @xmath21 site .",
    "the piece of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) containing this force is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the other member of the pair of nearest bi atoms .",
    "let us define the peierls order parameter ( amplitude of charge density wave ) @xmath79 by @xmath80 in the undistorted cubic structure , @xmath81 . in strong coupling , @xmath82 ,",
    "that is , the bi atoms have charge 2 on sublattice @xmath20 and 0 on sublattice @xmath21 .",
    "the force is @xmath83 on each oxygen , directed toward its nearest @xmath21-type bi neighbor , counteracted by a harmonic restoring force @xmath84 , yielding an optimum displacement @xmath85 or a `` breathing amplitude '' @xmath86 , where , the oxygen breathing order parameter @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "these relations remain true for arbitrary coupling ( @xmath89 ) . in strong coupling , site energies of bi @xmath3 orbitals",
    "are thus @xmath90 on @xmath20 sites and @xmath91 on @xmath21 sites . for hopping @xmath92 ,",
    "the lowest energy excitation is to move one electron from an @xmath20 site to a @xmath21 site",
    ". this costs energy @xmath93 which is the value of the peierls gap .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath94 to denote the value of the gap in the atomic limit , and @xmath95 for the value for the actual coupling strength under consideration .",
    "the limiting answer @xmath96 can also be found from the integral equation ( 23 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , by taking @xmath97 .",
    "we get a measure of the value @xmath98 where the crossover occurs between strong and weak coupling by comparing total energies . in the atomic limit , this is @xmath99 per atom ( @xmath90 per electron of on - site orbital energy , but at a cost of @xmath100 per atom of elastic energy . ) in the opposite ( @xmath36=0 ) limit , the electrons gain on average @xmath101 of delocalization energy by band formation in the undistorted crystal .",
    "these energies are equal at @xmath102 .",
    "so far we are safe in the adiabatic approximation , since the vibrational energy @xmath38 is small compared with the peierls gap in strong coupling . however , the true lowest energy excitation will cost less than @xmath60 once we allow relaxation of the atoms .",
    "thus the optical spectrum will have non - adiabatic franck - condon character , with minimum excitation energy corresponding to a `` self - trapped exciton . ''",
    "the companion paper @xcite pursues this topic .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to the case where one or two holes are doped into the half - filled band .",
    "we will consider both the ground state and the new excitations induced by the doping .      to remove an electron ,",
    "keeping the peierls distortion fixed , costs energy @xmath103 ( the amount of peierls attractive energy lost . )",
    "when @xmath92 , the hole sits on some particular @xmath20 sublattice site as a singly charged bi@xmath104 ion .",
    "the 6 surrounding oxygens now experience a diminished repulsive force , @xmath36 instead of @xmath105 , toward their bi@xmath2 neighbors .",
    "the local peierls displacement @xmath106 is therefore @xmath107 , or half of @xmath108 .",
    "this reduces the elastic energy by 6 times @xmath109 or @xmath110 but does this at the expense of raising the energy of the @xmath4 orbital at this site from @xmath90 to @xmath99 .",
    "since this orbital is occupied once , the net energy saved by this local distortion is @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting object , a point defect in the peierls order parameter , is a small hole - polaron . in a system with @xmath112",
    "bi atoms , the isolated polaron corresponds to the system having @xmath113 electrons .",
    "its energy @xmath114\\equiv e_{\\rm gs}(n-1 ) -e_{\\rm gs}(n)$ ] is @xmath110 , smaller than the removal energy @xmath103 when no relaxation is permitted .",
    "the difference is the polaron trapping energy , @xmath115=3g^2/k$ ] .",
    "photoemission would measure the polaron formation energy @xmath110 rather than @xmath103 provided the removal were done slowly enough that oxygen atoms could move to their new optimum positions .",
    "in fact , this is surely not the case , and one expects to see instead a peak photoemission intensity at the adiabatic energy @xmath103 , with a series of franck - condon vibrational sidebands with a gaussian envelope extending down to the threshold @xmath110 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the corresponding effect in lamno@xmath0 was given earlier @xcite .",
    "the hole polaron is shown schematically in part ( c ) of fig . [",
    "fig : lattice ] .",
    "it is clear that the orbitals on the surrounding 6 bi@xmath2 ions must also be altered by the oxygen relaxation . rather than having their energy pushed up by @xmath116 ,",
    "their energy is pushed up by @xmath117 , or @xmath118 rather than @xmath103 .",
    "thus the polaron defect has an interesting spectrum of gap states .",
    "there is the singly occupied @xmath20-sublattice state located at @xmath119 above the lower peierls band at @xmath120 , and there are six empty @xmath21-sublattice states located at energy @xmath121 below the upper peierls band at @xmath95 .",
    "this spectrum is shown on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "two polarons spatially separated cost two times @xmath110 , but if they occupy the * same * local site ( with opposite spin , @xmath122 ) then it is easy to see that the cost is only @xmath103 .",
    "this is because removal of two electrons costs @xmath123 in lost peierls energy , but when sitting on a single @xmath20 site ( converting the bi@xmath1 to a bi@xmath2 ) , the local strains on the six surrounding oxygens all disappear ( @xmath124 . ) this gains back @xmath103 that was previously paid in strain energy .",
    "the local @xmath3 orbital at the site of the bipolaron now has energy 0 because of no local strain , but unlike the polaron case , the loss of peierls energy of this state does not alter anything since the level is now empty .",
    "thus the total energy of the bipolaron is @xmath125=12g^2/k$ ] .",
    "relative to free holes which cost @xmath123 , the bipolaron trapping energy is @xmath126=12g^2/k$ ] . the energy released when two polarons bind into a singlet bipolaron is @xmath127 .",
    "however , this neglects on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath76 .",
    "we expect a reduction of the bipolaron binding energy to @xmath128 .",
    "the hubbard @xmath76 is defined as the energy difference between charged ions @xmath129 and `` neutrals '' @xmath130 for babio@xmath0 with oxygen atoms frozen in cubic perovskite positions .",
    "experimentally , the absence of free spins in doped babio@xmath0 indicates that bi@xmath104 ( with @xmath131 ) is disfavored .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 can not be large enough to destabilize bipolarons .",
    "vielsack and weber @xcite have done constrained density functional calculations to obtain @xmath76 .",
    "they fit their results to an effective @xmath76 of @xmath132 ev of a single band model like ours .",
    "this is similar in size to our attractive energy of @xmath133 0.6 ev .",
    "when hopping is turned back on , the attractive energy goes down , but the bipolaron also spreads out , so that the repulsive @xmath76 is less effective .",
    "thus @xmath76 is small enough to permit bipolarons to exist .",
    "the spectrum of babio@xmath0 with a bipolaron consists of a filled lower peierls band containing @xmath134 states at energy @xmath135 , one empty midband state @xmath136 , and @xmath137 upper peierls band states at energy @xmath138 .",
    "six new empty states appear below the empty upper peierls band , at energy @xmath139 .",
    "these are the @xmath3 orbitals on the six @xmath21 sites surrounding the bipolaron , which have only 5 out of 6 first neighbor oxygens with displacement @xmath108 , and one undisplaced .",
    "the spectrum is shown on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .      for the perfectly ordered half - filled band ,",
    "the peierls gap diminishes quadratically as @xmath140 is turned on , @xmath141 this follows by expanding the integral equation ( 23 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for small values of @xmath142",
    ". the amplitude @xmath143 of the cdw diminishes the same way , from 1 to @xmath144 .",
    "the eigenstates are now extended bloch states of energy @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the eigenvalue of the undistorted lattice , @xmath147 .",
    "thus the least expensive delocalized hole states are at the top of the lower peierls band where @xmath148 and cost @xmath149 .",
    "the competing bipolaron state can no longer be completely localized on a site because the charge on the nominal bi@xmath1 ions is @xmath150 it is not easy to develop a systematic @xmath151 expansion for the localized solutions .",
    "the problem is that as oxygens move and the polaron localizes , wavefunctions and charges of all occupied delocalized states must be altered self - consistently near the polaron .",
    "the algorithms used are explained in detail in the ma thesis of the first author @xcite . a large supercell ( typically between 100 and 1000 bi atoms )",
    "was chosen , with periodic boundary conditions applied .",
    "it was useful to have the translation vectors @xmath152 of the supercell * not * lie along symmetry axes , but to use small asymmetrical deviations in order to lift degeneracies .",
    "the translation vectors all translate @xmath20 sublattice points to other @xmath20 sublattice points , so that the peierls state fits the cell .",
    "trial oxygen positions are chosen , the hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized , and forces on oxygen atoms are calculated by summing over occupied wavefunctions to get the electronic charges on the two adjacent bi atoms .",
    "a variable metric method @xcite was used to iterate towards optimal oxygen displacements .",
    "we confirmed that for the half - filled case , the density of states , oxygen coordinates , and peierls gap all agreed well with calculations by other methods .",
    "the half - filled ground state serves as the `` vacuum '' for the rest of our work . to study doping by one or two holes per supercell ,",
    "a cell with @xmath153200 atoms is sufficient if the coupling constant @xmath154 . for smaller @xmath72 ,",
    "larger cells are needed .      by simply restricting the occupancy to be @xmath113 or @xmath155 ,",
    "we obtain solutions with polaron or bipolaron local defects .",
    "the numerical results for the `` trapping energies '' are shown in fig .",

    "stable polaron solutions occur when @xmath156 .",
    "stable bipolaron solutions occur when @xmath157 . at lower values of @xmath72",
    "an inserted hole just stays at the top of the valence band , causing an order @xmath158 renormalization of the peierls gap . for @xmath159 ,",
    "such states were always found to be numerically unstable toward formation of local defects .",
    "the onset of localized solutions seems to occur continuously , unlike the case where an empty @xmath3-band is doped and localized solutions appear discontinuously ( in adiabatic approximation ) at much larger values @xmath160 .",
    "there are several reasons for the ease of polaron formation in the peierls state relative to the empty band .",
    "perhaps foremost is the fact that there is less to be gained by delocalization , because low - energy delocalized states are occupied .",
    "also , the peierls state has lattice strain already built in , so polaron formation can occur by reduction of the peierls lattice strain rather than by initiation of new lattice strain .",
    "although we do not have a systematic @xmath151 perturbation theory , nevertheless , a very simple correction to the @xmath161 expression can be made .",

    "[ fig : centralch ] , the hole charge at the central site @xmath170 is plotted . for @xmath171 ,",
    "the polaron is almost completely on the central site , whereas for the bipolaron , the available charge on the central @xmath20-type atom is essentially all depleted for @xmath172 , but until a somewhat larger @xmath72 , some charge must be removed from surrounding sites . at the realistic value @xmath173 ,",

    "numerical finite - size effects prevent high accuracy in these estimates .",
    "the reason for the weaker binding of the @xmath3-like state is that it couples to the polaron state which splits off from the valence band , forming a spread out polaron with no radial node , and an empty state bound below the conduction band with a radial node .    in principle , these bound states can be seen spectroscopically , as weak mid - gap absorption proportional to doping concentration .",

    "these numbers should not be taken as reliable predictions of actual spectral lines for several reasons .",
    "first , the predictions are sure to be somewhat sensitive to the model , especially to the fact that our model omits the disorder potential caused by dopant atoms .",
    "second , there will be significant franck - condon effects coming from the fact that if the empty midgap states are suddenly occupied by an optical transition , local oxygen relaxations can lower the energy of these states . finally ,",
    "as explained in the companion paper , the peierls gap of pure babio@xmath0 in this model is not `` clean . ''",
    "when an electron - hole pair is created in the pure material , self - trapping of the electron and hole should occur , causing absorption in franck - condon sidebands below the energy of the nominal peierls gap @xmath60 .",
