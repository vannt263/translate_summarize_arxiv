    "it has long been recognized that the masses , @xmath0 , of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are proportional to the stellar luminosities , @xmath1 , of the bulges of the galaxies in which they are located ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "@xmath0 can be most easily determined for agns .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath0 can be estimated for an agn from the broad emission lines in a single - epoch spectrum , so long as the broad - line region ( blr ) motions are gravitationally dominated .",
    "reverberation mapping has verified that the blr motions are dominated by gravity @xcite and has confirmed the accuracy of the dibai method ( see @xcite ) . with the advent of the sdss",
    ", the dibai method has been used to estimate the masses of tens of thousands of black holes . @xcite",
    "give masses for 900 sdss agns for which @xcite have spectroscopically estimated @xmath5 , the ratio of agn light to host galaxy light at 5100   in the rest frame . in this paper",
    "we use these data to study the dependence of @xmath5 on the accretion rate ( which we will express by the eddington ratio , @xmath4 ) and to obtain an improved @xmath0  @xmath1 relationship .",
    "1a shows @xmath6 as a function of @xmath5 . because of difficulties in measuring @xmath5 when the agn is too bright or too faint compared with the galaxy , upper and lower cutoffs on the ratio have been imposed by @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 appears on both axes and since @xmath7 , we expect a simple linear correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "1a does indeed show a correlation , but the scatter is very large . this scatter could be a consequence of measurement errors , or it could reflect intrinsic scatter in the @xmath0  @xmath1 relationship .    in fig .",
    "2a we show that if we take a narrow range of @xmath0 , then the luminosity deviation , @xmath8 , from the diagonal line in the left panel of fig .",
    "1 is a strong function of redshift .",
    "this has a simple explanation : at low redshift an sdss fiber is only taking in a small part of the bulge of the host galaxy , so the luminosity of the bulge is underestimated for nearby galaxies .",
    "2b uses the @xcite photometry of virgo ellipticals to show that at a given redshift , the fraction of total bulge light in a an sdss fiber decreases as the luminosity of the galaxy increases .",
    "the combination of the two effects will be discussed in detail elsewhere ( gaskell & kormendy , in preparation ) , but the dramatic improvement in the @xmath4  @xmath5 relationship can be illustrated simply by plotting agns in a narrow range of @xmath9 and black hole mass .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 shows the resulting @xmath0  @xmath1 relationship for agns over a narrow redshift range .",
    "@xmath1 has been approximately corrected using the relationship for the virgo ellipticals in fig .",
    "2b . the dispersion in mass in fig .",
    "3 is @xmath2 dex which is better than the @xmath10 dex dispersion @xcite found for the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 relationship for non - active galaxies . applying the luminosity correction from fig .",
    "2b also increases the slope of @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 relationship for the sdss agns .",
    "if we take an @xmath0  @xmath1 relationship of the form @xmath11 , then for the complete uncorrected @xcite sample ( not shown ) , an ols - bisector fit gives a slope of @xmath12 , while a similar fit for the corrected subset of 100 agns in fig .",
    "3 gives @xmath13 .",
    "if we take the luminosity - dependence of the mass / light ratio of bulges to be @xmath14 @xcite , then @xmath15 .",
    "the small dispersion in the agn @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 relationship in fig .",
    "3 implies that the intrinsic relationship must be very tight ( as tight as the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath16 relationship ) , since much or all of the scatter can be accounted for by observational errors .",
    "the small dispersion also supports the reliability of agn black hole masses determined via the dibai method .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this implies that for the agns for which the method has been used , both the structure and intrinsic spectral energy distributions are very similar @xcite . the slope in fig .",
    "1b ( @xmath17 ) shows that the hosts of high - accretion - rate agns do not systematically deviate from the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 relationship .",
    "1b makes determination of host - galaxy contamination of agn photometry and spectroscopy straight forward .",
    "one immediate result is to show that low @xmath4 agns must have greater optical variability amplitudes on average than high @xmath4 agns ( nls1s ) . @xcite",
    "have already shown that even without corrections for host galaxy contamination , nls1s seem to be less variable than non - nls1s .",
    "1b shows that this difference will be much greater when the higher galaxy contamination of non - nls1s is allowed for .",
