    "physics in the context of lorentz - violating theories have been an important branch for different theoretical and experimental research in recent years . the standard model extension ( sme )",
    "@xcite is the general theoretical framework for studying lorentz violation ( lv ) effects , and it is build by adding lorentz - violating terms in all sectors of the minimal standard model .",
    "particulary , the abelian gauge sector of the sme is the principal focus in searching for lv effects in physical systems jackiw-@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , magnetic flux vortices have gained great interest since abrikosov s description for type - ii superconductors @xcite , which arise naturally from the non - relativistic limit of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory @xcite . in field theory ,",
    "stable vortex configurations came up with the seminal work by nielsen and olesen @xcite whose study of the maxwell - higgs ( mh ) model shows that electrically neutral vortex solutions correspond to the ones obtained by abrikosov . lately , the existence of electrically charged vortex solutions in chern - simons - higgs ( csh ) cs , csv and maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcsh ) @xcite models was verified .",
    "the study of topological defects in the context of lorentz - violating models has been performed in some cases , for example , scalar systems @xcite , abelian monopoles @xcite , tensor fields @xcite , etc .",
    "the research for explicit bps vortex solutions in the context of sme was recently performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate how lv introduced in higgs sector affects the structure of topological defects ; particularly , we discuss charged bps vortices in lorentz - violating mh models .",
    "it is easily observed that higgs s lorentz - violating term introduces anisotropies in the dispersion relations of the higgs field .",
    "consequently , these anisotropies provide a hamiltonian dynamics very similar to gl models describing anisotropic and layered superconductors ( e.g. high-@xmath0 superconductors ) @xcite .",
    "so , the main motivation for studying topological defects in the context of lorentz - violating theories comes from the similitude with the mathematical structure describing the physics of new high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "these new structures lead to a strong anisotropy of magnetic properties and gives rise to new phenomena , such as formation of two - dimensional vortices and existence of new type of vortex lattices @xcite .",
    "the manuscript begins by studying the mh model supplemented with a cpt - odd or carroll - field - jackiw ( cfj ) term and then with a cpt - even term in gauge sector . in both situations we have introduced a cpt - even and lorentz - violating term in the higgs sector . as can be expected , for the first model electrically charged configurations appear due to the cfj term in the same manner as in mcsh model . for the second model , electric and magnetic sectors are coupled due to parity - odd coefficients presents in the electromagnetic cpt - even and lorentz - violating term . in the following sections , we analyze in detail both lv scenarios for abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortices",
    "we consider the abelian sector of the sme , which corresponds to the mh model supplemented with lorentz - violating terms @xcite .",
    "our first analysis is restricted to the photon sector , including only the cfj term @xcite , while the higgs sector is modified by a cpt - even term , @xmath1where @xmath2 is the abelian gauge field , and @xmath3 is the electromagnetic strength tensor . the four - vector @xmath4 is the cfj background with mass dimension + 1 .",
    "the coupling between the gauge field and higgs field @xmath5 is given by the minimal covariant derivative @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electric charge .",
    "the lv in the higgs sector is ruled by the cpt - even real symmetric and dimensionless tensor @xmath8 .",

    "similarly that happens in the mcsh model @xcite , we must modify the model in ( [ lag_cfj ] ) by introducing a neutral scalar field @xmath13 such that the new model supporting vortex solutions is @xmath14 \\psi ^{2}\\left\\vert \\phi \\right\\vert ^{2}-u\\left ( \\left\\vert \\phi \\right\\vert , \\psi \\right ) ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]and the potential @xmath15 providing charged bps vortices is @xmath16 ^{2},\\]]where @xmath17 is defined in terms of the parity - even components of the lorentz - violating higgs tensor @xmath18 % \\left [ 1-\\left ( k_{\\phi \\phi } \\right ) _ { rr}\\right ] } .\\]]it can be observed that this potential provides two vacua states , one symmetric @xmath19 $ ] and another asymmetric , responsible for generating topological bps vortices@xmath20 $ ] .",

    "the ringlike behavior resembling the csh and mcsh behaviors is an interesting effect of lv in the higgs sector .",
    "we have performed a comprehensive analysis on the formation of charged bps vortices in the context of the sme .",
    "two cases were studied separately .",
    "first , we have discussed the abelian mh model supplemented with the cfj term in electromagnetic sector and a cpt - even lorentz - violating term in the higgs sector .",
    "the second case analyzed is also the abelian mh model but this time provided with cpt - even and lorentz - violating terms in both the photon and higgs sectors .",
    "we have verified that for supporting charged bps vortex solutions the original models must be modified by introducing a neutral scalar field @xmath191 , with appropriate dynamic .",
    "this procedure is similar to the one that happens in mcsh model .",
    "notwithstanding , there are some differences between the cpt - odd and cpt - even charged vortices : in the cpt - odd case , both the charge density and the total charge are non - null whereas , in the cpt - even case , the charge density is nonzero , but the total electric charge is null .",
    "another important result involves the magnetic flux , which , besides being proportional to the winding number , also depends explicitly in the lorentz - violating coefficients belonging to the higgs sector , such as presented in eqs .",
    "( [ flux_cfj ] ) and ( [ flux_mhlv ] ) .",
    "this result was firstly obtained in the context of uncharged bps vortices in sme carlison1 , and it appears to be a general effect produced by the cpt - even and lorentz - violating terms of the higgs sector .",
    "one of the observations already made in ref.@xcite is the change of the vortex ansatz ( [ newaz ] ) describing the profiles of the higgs and gauge fields .",
    "this is an important fact because the boundary condition satisfied by gauge field at origin [ see eqs .",
    "( [ bcgd1 ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) ] is modified by lv belonging to higgs sector . otherwise , the solutions of self - dual or bps equations will not be topological ; neither will have finite energy . such change in gauge field boundary conditions are crucial for the new characteristic presented by the quantized magnetic flux .",
    "our analysis shows that for fixed lv in photon sector , the lv in higgs sector increases the richness of bps solutions in the context of sme .",
    "for example , the presence of lv in higgs sector allows to interpolate cpt - odd vortices between very spread for @xmath167 to some more localized ones when @xmath192 . for @xmath193 profiles run from the mcsh @xmath194 to the mh ( @xmath80 ) solutions . for the cpt - even vortices , the profiles in the region @xmath195are wider and more spread for decreasing @xmath36 .",
    "but now the value @xmath170 represents the vortex solution of mh model . for @xmath86 and increasing @xmath36 , the vortex profiles are confined between the mh model ( solid black line ) and the one obtained when ( @xmath87 ) ( solid blue line ) .",
    "an interesting fact in cpt - even vortices is the appearance of ringlike profiles ( for magnetic field and bps energy density ) for sufficiently large values of @xmath36 parameter , as explicitly shown in figs .",
    "[ mf ] and [ ed ] , respectively .",
    "another peculiarity is the localized magnetic flux inversion , such as was also observed in the absence of lv in higgs sector @xcite .",
    "this property appears to be a typical effect of cpt - even and lorentz - violating terms in photon sector .    a remark on the subject of considering large values for lorentz - violation coefficients : in the context of standard model extension , the lorentz - violating parameters must be sufficiently small .",
    "however , as energy positivity is preserved whenever @xmath73 , we can consider large values of @xmath36 within an effective model describing the electrodynamics of some type of material media .    in this context we , can also comment about implication of these lorentz - violating models in superconductivity physics .",
    "the new materials presenting high - temperature superconductivity are anisotropic ; most of them have a layered structure .",
    "the simplest gl model is for an uniaxial superconductor whose free energy density is written as@xmath196where @xmath197 is the magnetic field produced by the gauge field @xmath198 and @xmath55 is a constant , but @xmath199 depends in temperature changing its sign at @xmath200 , and @xmath201 is a constant tensor coupled to the crystal axes .",
    "it is possible to establish a connection between the lorentz - violating models whose energy densities are given by eqs .",
    "( hstat ) , ( [ e_x ] ) and the free energy ( [ ffee ] ) describing a high-@xmath202 superconductor . such connection is provided by the term @xmath203 \\left ( d_{i}\\phi \\right ) ^{\\ast } \\left ( d_{j}\\phi \\right ) $ ] , which allows to relate the matrix @xmath108 with the tensor @xmath204 it is clear that in both lv models , the coefficients do not depend in temperature as happens in phenomenological ginzburg - landau s models .",
    "the study of possible contributions to superconductivity can be obtained by analyzing the nonrelativistic limits of both lv models at finite temperature .",
    "such approach would allow to analyze lorentz - violations effects or contributions in london free energy , the josephson effect , the interaction of vortices with the crystalline structure ( the vortex s intrinsic pinning ) , and resistivity , among others .",
    "advances in such interesting research would be developed in a future manuscript .",
    "future developments can be oriented to analyze the influence of lorentz violation in the existence of topological defects in the non - abelian sector of the standard model i.e. , magnetic monopoles and non - abelian vortices in the context of standard model extension .",
