    "in 2005 , cohen and moerner developed a new tool for trapping and manipulating small objects in solution .",
    "the technique traps small objects by counteracting the brownian motion directly via electrokinetic forces that typically include electrophoretic forces ( proportional to the charge of the desired object ) and electroosmotic forces ( proportional to the charge of ions in solution that drag the desired object ) .",
    "a key advantage is that the object under study can diffuse freely in solution .",
    "competitive techniques all perturb the molecule more . for example , in optical tweezers , the molecule of interest is often tethered to a long piece of dna @xcite . in atomic force microscopy ,",
    "the object of interest is chemically or physically bound to a substrate @xcite . in convex lens - induced confinement ( clic ) , the object is confined vertically in a thin chamber @xcite .",
    "feedback traps have been applied to the study of single molecules @xcite and to explore fundamental questions in the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of small systems @xcite . for the latter applications",
    ", we have developed an improved abel trap that can create _",
    "virtual potentials _ for the particle of interest . reflecting this more general application and the fact that the trapping forces need not be electrokinetic",
    " any available force will do  we adopt the more generic name of _ feedback trap_.    the feedback trap periodically measures the position of an object and then calculates and applies a force to keep the particle in the field of view .",
    "the action of the feedback loop creates a virtual potential that can confine a particle or force it to perform more complicated motion .",
    "this use of feedback to change qualitatively the dynamics of a system ( from free diffusion to potential motion ) is very much in keeping with the spirit of the  creative interaction of physics and control theory \" that has been a focus of _ cybernetical physics _ , or",
    "_ cyberphysics _ @xcite .",
    "the tools resulting from this creative interaction have unique capabilities and have led to investigations of fundamental issues at the intersection of thermodynamics and information theory .",

    "we trap silica beads of nominal diameter 1.5  @xmath4 m immersed in water .",
    "the beads are heavy enough to sink to the bottom of the sample cell and stay in focus in the microscope but light enough to diffuse laterally . thus , gravity balances electrostatic repulsion from the bottom and confines particles vertically . two sets of electrodes control the electric field in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , applying the desired force to the particle .",

    "the particle position @xmath10 is estimated using a centroid algorithm @xcite , and the feedback force is calculated from the chosen potential , evaluated at the observed position @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the feedback trap applies a voltage @xmath11 that is calibrated to correspond to the desired force @xmath12 , which moves the particle .",
    "the voltage is kept constant for @xmath9  ms and then updated with a delay @xmath13  ms relative to the exposure midpoint .    in the original version of the abel trap @xcite and in our first version @xcite ,",
    "as well , the imaging was based on fluorescence illumination , as is appropriate for fluorescent particles and for labeling individual molecules in solution . in such low - light conditions ,",
    "camera - based imaging systems need to integrate all the time to capture as much information from a fluorescent particle as possible , leading to a camera - exposure time @xmath14 .",
    "even with such a long exposure , the overall light levels are low , implying significant observation noise due to photon shot noise and the diffraction limit of the microscope . in the much brighter scattering - based illumination described above",
    ", the camera time can be short ( @xmath15 ) and the measurement noise can be small @xcite .",
    "the simplified theoretical description developed below takes advantage of this improved illumination scheme .",
    "in this paper , we focus on applications of the feedback trap to the study of small particles in virtual potentials whose form we can control and manipulate at will . because the objects are small , their fluctuations are important , and describing energy terms requires the formalism of _ stochastic thermodynamics _",
    "@xcite , which considers fluctuating mesoscopic systems . in this case , the system ( the particle ) is immersed in a heat bath of constant temperature , so that all processes are isothermal .",
    "below , we outline some of the relevant aspects that show how the trap dynamics are related to those of the feedback loop and how both are related to thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the low - frequency stochastic dynamics of a brownian particle are well described by a langevin equation in the overdamped limit .",
    "for a one - dimensional trajectory @xmath16 , the langevin equation is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the drag coefficient , @xmath19 is the fluctuating thermal force acting on the particle , and @xmath20 is the external force . here",
    ", the force @xmath21 is chosen to be the gradient of a time - dependent potential @xmath22 . in equation",
    "[ eq : langevineqintro ] , we have neglected the mass term , @xmath23 , as the inertial time scale , @xmath24 , is of order microseconds , whereas experimental time scales are of order milliseconds .",
    "although equation  [ eq : langevineqintro ] is one dimensional , the particle moves in three dimensions . we have already discussed how gravity and electrostatic forces naturally confine the motion in @xmath25 . for the lateral @xmath6-direction",
    ", we confine the particle by adding an additional harmonic component , so that @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath6 motion plays no role in work and heat estimates and is ignored in the rest of the analysis , which focuses on the one - dimensional motion along @xmath5 .",
    "to discretize equation [ eq : langevineqintro ] , we integrate it over the time interval @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the feedback cycle time .",
    "the force is kept constant in that time interval : , for @xmath30 .",
    "the discretized position of the particle ( @xmath31 ) at the beginning of that interval ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath33 in equation  [ eq : actualposition ] , @xmath34 represents the displacement due to thermal forces that are integrated over the cycle time @xmath29 of a single time step .",
    "the displacements are described by i.i.d .",
    "random gaussian variables with mean 0 , and variances @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the lateral diffusion coefficient of the particle . as discussed above , in general , we would supplement equation  [ eq : actualposition ] with a second equation for the observed position , which incorporates effects due to exposure averaging , measurement noise , and the rather subtle noise correlations that follow @xcite . fortunately , these are all small effects in the current setup and will be ignored here .    to simplify the equation of motion ,",
    "let us introduce coordinates where lengths are scaled by @xmath37 and energies by @xmath38 .",
    "we also use the einstein relation @xmath39 .",
    "more formally , we define ( omitting the time subscript for simplicity ) , @xmath40 in terms of these scalings , equation  [ eq : actualposition ] becomes @xmath41 note the @xmath42 subscript for the force term , which reflects the unit delay of the feedback system . in our experimental design ,",
    "we take care to make sure that the updated force is applied precisely at a time @xmath29 after the midpoint of the exposure , as this is necessary in the simplified equations we give here .",
    "we note that the experiment is particularly sensitive to timing variations and that using `` real time '' programming techniques and hardware is important . finally , in equation  [ eq : actualpositionscaled ] , the scaled noise terms @xmath43 are independent gaussian random variables with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "an important special case is a harmonic potential , @xmath46 , or @xmath47 , where . in the last version , @xmath48 is the relaxation time of an overdamped particle in a harmonic potential .",
    "more generally , we can replace @xmath49 by @xmath50 , evaluated at the bottom of a local potential well .",
    "for a harmonic potential , the scaled equation of motion is @xmath51 in earlier work , we explored in detail the dynamics and thermodynamics of a particle in a virtual harmonic potential , taking into account the delay , exposure time , and the observational noise @xcite .",
    "if the relaxation time of the potential is much greater than the update time of the feedback trap @xmath52 , or @xmath53 , the dynamics approaches the dynamics of a particle in a physical potential . in our experiment",
    ", the feedback gain never exceeds @xmath54 . at such values of @xmath55",
    ", one might worry that corrections begin to be significant .",
    "nevertheless , for a cyclic protocol , where the potential is the same at the beginning and the end of a protocol , the correction term cancels out , and the work measurement is exact @xcite .",
    "the energy scale of the processes we consider are of order @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the temperature of the heat bath the system is immersed in and @xmath58 is boltzmann s constant . for detecting such small energy changes in protocols that can last minutes , we need careful , high - precision calibration techniques that can convert the applied voltages into precisely known forces @xcite . here , we briefly summarize the calibration process .    rearranging equation [ eq : actualpositionscaled ] for the feedback trap dynamics",
    ", we define the displacement .",
    "thus , the displacement results from a deterministic component , @xmath59 , which we control , and a stochastic component , @xmath60 , which we do not . to control the forces @xmath61 , we apply a voltage @xmath62 , which generates an electric field that moves the charged particle to a new position . in other words ,",
    "the controllable component of displacement @xmath61 is proportional to the applied voltage as , where @xmath4 is the mobility ( response ) of a charged particle ( in an ionic fluid ) to the applied voltage .",
    "the offset @xmath63 arises from electrochemical reactions at the electrodes and from the amplifier in the circuit .",
    "the link between displacement @xmath64 and applied voltage is then @xmath65    in principle , we could estimate @xmath4 and @xmath63 as the slope and intercept in a linear , least - squares fit to @xmath66 measurements and could similarly infer the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 from the residuals .",
    "however , our goal is to implement a continuous calibration , and we can not afford to recompute such a fit at every time step in the experiment .",
    "fortunately , it has long been known that linear least - squares fits have a _ recursive _ formulation where existing estimates of slope and intercept are updated each time a new data point arrives @xcite . here , in order to treat small noise correlations ( arising from term neglected in equation  [ eq : actualposition ] ) , we use a slight generalization known as _ recursive maximum likelihood _ ( rml ) @xcite , which is a variant of the _ kalman filter _ @xcite .",
    "one complication is that experimental parameters slowly drift due to temperature drifts and electrochemical reactions .",
    "we thus limit the amount of the past time series measurements that enter into the calibration by using a _ running average _ variant of the rml algorithm that weights new versus old measurements @xcite .",
    "another complication is that the feedback trap corrects motion in two dimensions .",
    "since the electric - field lines are not exactly aligned along the @xmath5-@xmath6 axes ( defined by the camera pixels ) , we need to implement a full two - dimensional version of the rml algorithm that accounts for coupling between axes .",
    "apart from generalizing the mobility @xmath4 to a two - by - two matrix @xmath67 and the offset voltage to a vector @xmath68 , the algorithm is identical .",
    "in an important conceptual advance for extending thermodynamics to small systems , sekimoto proposed a method for determining the stochastic energetics of a particle solely from its langevin dynamics @xcite .",
    "he showed that thermodynamical quantities such as work and heat can be estimated solely from a particle s trajectory @xmath16 and the shape of the potential @xmath22 . by using just the trajectory and the potential",
    ", one can isolate and measure the quantities of direct interest .",
    "this method removes the contributions of work and dissipation from ancillary devices ",
    "computer , camera , illumination , etc.that are irrelevant to calculating the work done by the potential on the particle and the heat dissipated into the surrounding bath .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics can be formulated for an individual fluctuating trajectory : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the work increment done by the changing potential on the particle , @xmath71 is the heat transferred to the environment by the motion of the particle , and @xmath72 is the change in the potential energy of the particle in the external potential .",
    "equation [ eq : firstlaw ] uses a sign convention where refers to work done by the changing potential on the particle and means that heat is transferred to the bath .",
    "this convention is convenient for comparing work and heat in a cyclic process , as both distributions are centered on the same mean .",
    "as proposed by sekimoto @xcite , the work over the entire trajectory is simply the sum over potential changes evaluated at the local position of the particle , and the heat is the sum of force times velocity : @xmath73 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : workheat}\\ ] ] because the trajectory is fluctuating and different for each realization of the experimental protocol , so are the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; nevertheless , the first law applies both to the individual trajectory and to the ensemble average over those trajectories : @xmath76      equation [ eq : workheat ] gives a way to estimate work and heat from a single continuous trajectory of a particle in a physical potential @xmath1 .",
    "there are two issues in applying it to our experiments .",
    "first , our trajectories are discrete and not continuous .",
    "second , as equation  [ eq : actualpositionscaled ] indicates , the dynamics of a particle in a virtual potential generally differ from those of a particle in the corresponding physical potential .",
    "for example , changing the stiffness of a harmonic potential quasistatically leads to expected work values of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is defined above equation  [ eq : harmonic ] and where @xmath79 is the change in equilibrium free energy @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that cyclic operations such as expanding and then compressing lead to @xmath80 , exactly @xcite .",
    "the naive discretization of the stochastic work is simply @xmath81 where we have omitted the term @xmath82 from the sum and where @xmath83 .",
    "the discretization of heat is more subtle .",
    "because @xmath84 appears in its definition , we can use the langevin equation to write @xmath85 + \\xi^{(f)}(t ) \\right\\ } \\",
    ", f[x(t),t ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : heat1}\\ ] ] in equation  [ eq : heat1 ] , we see that there is now multiplicative ( state - dependent ) noise : the amplitude of @xmath86 is multiplied by @xmath87 .",
    "discretization then leads to the well - known `` ito - stratonovich '' dilemma , which stems from the need to choose a point in the time interval @xmath29 to evaluate the force @xmath88 @xcite . in standard discussions of stochastic dynamics",
    ", it is assumed that the stratonovich convention is the appropriate one , where the forces that control the noise amplitude are evaluated at the midpoint of the time interval .",
    "this leads to @xmath89    unfortunately , the discretization proposed in equation  [ eq : heatdiscrete ] is problematic . to see this , consider a test case where it is satisfactory , the static harmonic potential .",
    "in dimensionless units , the force @xmath90 . because the potential is not altered , the stochastic work @xmath74 is identically zero .",
    "then    @xmath91    the last term in equation  [ eq : heatdiscretequadratic ] is just @xmath92 .",
    "thus , both and , as required by equation  [ eq : firstlawstochens ] .",
    "next , we try @xmath93 , or @xmath94 . evaluating @xmath59 at the midpoint then gives @xmath95 the terms that cancel lead to @xmath96 , as before ; however , the terms that do not cancel give an error at each time step . in a long time series , this _ secular _ error dominates , making the estimator useless .    the heart of the difficulty , that the numerical method does not respect conservation of energy , is a familiar one in numerical analysis , and methods such as _ velocity verlet _ and _ symplectic integration _ have been developed for solving this problem in hamiltonian systems @xcite . for langevin equations ,",
    "sivak et al .",
    "@xcite derived a similar scheme and showed that it made such secular errors very small .",
    "however , those methods were derived for systems with momentum variables and break down in the brownian - motion limit , where mass terms are taken to zero .",
    "in private correspondence , d.  chiuchi noted that the naive estimator is equivalent to a trapezoidal integration scheme and suggested substituting a higher - order integrator such as simpson s rule .",
    "as he emphasized , from general discussion of the integration of stochastic differential equations , such a scheme can not be quite correct because one must consistently handle both the deterministic and stochastic terms .",
    "yet we will see below that the scheme works in the sense that numerical estimation errors do not increase linearly in time",

    "the landauer principle , formulated in 1961 , connects the seemingly disparate concepts of information , work , and heat exchange .",
    "landauer argued that _ information is physical_it is tied to a physical representation and therefore restricted to what the laws of physics allow @xcite .",
    "according to this physical view of information and its processing , erasing information in a macroscopic or mesoscopic system should require a minimum amount of work , @xmath3 per bit erased .",
    "the heat in this process is transferred to the bath , reversibly if the erasure is done slowly enough and with a properly chosen protocol @xcite . at the time , the immediate motivation was to understand the minimum power a computer requires to function .",
    "later , bennett recognized the relevance of landauer s principle in explaining paradoxes raised by the maxwell - demon thought experiment @xcite .",
    "in particular , szilard showed , in a slight adaptation of maxwell s original scenario @xcite , that acquiring one bit of information about a system allows the extraction of @xmath3 of work from the surrounding heat bath , in apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "principle then implies that the same amount of work ( or more ) must be done when erasing the acquired information .",
    "modern theoretical developments have expanded this picture into one where _ measurement _ correlates a physical measuring device with a physical system of interest . _ feedback _ then uses these correlations to extract work from the physical system . finally , the measuring device is _ reset _ to complete a full cycle where system and measuring device are in their original states .",
    "thus , in a complete cycle , the net amount of work done is zero , or more .",

    "the harmonic trap is applied for 0.5  s , and then the potential is abruptly changed to a static double well ( equation [ eq : dwpotential ] ) . since the harmonic trap position corresponds to the position of one or the other well in the new potential , the perturbations due to the potential switch are small .",

    "now , we set @xmath145 to simplify the analysis . from the change of variables formula for probability distributions @xcite , the random variable @xmath146 is distributed as @xmath147 distribution with one degree of freedom , @xmath148 , where the heaviside step function @xmath149 enforces @xmath150 .",
    "the characteristic function , @xmath151 is then @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath96 distribution is the difference between two such random variables .",
    "if @xmath119 is much longer than the characteristic relaxation time of the trap , the positions at @xmath153 and @xmath154 are independent . in these experiments ,",
    "the particle relaxes in a static potential for 0.5  s , which is larger than the 0.03  s - long relaxation time of a potential , implying independent positions .",

    "the discrepancies may be traced back to the finite update time @xmath29 of the feedback trap , rather than the deviation of local well shape from a harmonic potential .",
    "we are now in a position to understand the perhaps - surprising result that heat measurements in a long protocol have a distribution that is much broader than the corresponding work measurement .",
    "as we have seen ( equation  [ eq : variances ] ) , the variances are related as @xmath162 .",
    "but , as figure  [ fig : varjar ] a and the constraint imposed by the jarzynski relation ( equation  [ eq : gausscumulantintro2 ] ) shows , @xmath137 _ must _ go to zero in the long - cycle ( @xmath163 ) limit .",
    "thus , at long times , we expect @xmath164 .",
    "yet the arguments in the previous suggestion ( and equation  [ eq : heat - dist - cont ] ) both show that @xmath165 , independent of cycle time .",

    "@xcite , measurements start and end in with the system in local equilibrium , where @xmath141 , @xmath166 , and @xmath138 can be all computed directly from the shape of the potential @xmath0 . in such cases , which often correspond to slow protocols , the analysis given here suggests that the mean heat estimate @xmath167 should be inferred by combining the measured mean work @xmath168 with the computed value of @xmath166 .",

    "although there remain basic mathematical questions as to how best to estimate heat from a stochastic time series , we found  following a suggestion by d. chiuchi  that a higher - order numerical method based on simpson s rule cures the most basic issue , a secular divergence of the estimate that , because it grows with time , always dominates when applied to long trajectories",
    ". it would be interesting to understand this issue better and to have a more proper integration scheme .    in comparing the work and heat measurements , we found their average values to be approximately consistent with the expected values from the first law of thermodynamics but that the width of the work distribution becomes much narrower than that of the heat distribution , which is always of order @xmath38 .",
    "such behavior is expected for long time series .",
    "it implies that , even if you are interested in estimating the mean heat transferred to a bath ( as in these erasure experiments ) , you will minimize statistical errors by first estimating the mean of the work distribution and then using the first law to convert that estimate into one for the heat transfer .    finally ,",
    "although there has not been space to review the work , the feedback trap has also been used for several related projects . in this paper , we have discussed information erasure assuming that bits are symmetric and associated with equal volumes in phase space , but we can use the unique capabilities of the feedback trap to design potentials where different bits have different sizes @xcite .",
