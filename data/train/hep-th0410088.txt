    "one of the main challenges in particle physics is the understanding and/or classification of quite a large number of presently known hadronic resonances . here",
    "we are faced with an intriguing situation : in the `` horizontal '' direction one has flavor symmetries and rather powerful quantitative techniques with practically none understanding of the corresponding underlying fundamental interaction . as for the `` vertical '' direction ( fixed flavor content ) , the basic interaction is given by the presently widely accepted quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) theory , however the non - perturbative features of qcd have made it difficult to apply the theory exactly .",
    "quite a number of approaches to deal with this region have been proposed so far with different degree of success .",
    "we believe that the merits of the approach described in this paper are both the fact that our starting point is qcd itself and that the predictions fit very well with experiment .    if the hadron lowest ground states are colorless ( our assumption ) and in the approximation of an external qcd potential , the hadron spectrum above these levels will be generated by color - singlet quanta , whether made of dressed two - gluon configurations , three - gluons , ",
    ". every possible configuration will appear .",
    "no matter what the mechanism responsible for a given flavor state , the next vibrational , rotational or pulsed excitation corresponds to the `` addition '' of one such collective color - singlet multigluon quantum superposition . in the fully relativistic qcd theory , these contributions have to come from summations of appropriate feynman diagrams , in which dressed @xmath9-gluon configurations are exchanged .",
    "we rearrange the sum by lumping together contributions from @xmath9-gluon irreducible parts , @xmath10 and with the same lorentz quantum numbers .",
    "the simplest such system will have the quantum numbers of di - gluon , i.e. @xmath11 . the color singlet external field can thus be constructed from the qcd gluon field as a sum ( @xmath1 is the color-@xmath2 metric , @xmath12 are the totally symmetric @xmath13 coefficients ) @xmath14 in the above , @xmath15 is the dressed gluon field .",
    "we suggest that the main feature of hadron excitations is due to a component of qcd representing the exchange of a two - gluon effective gravity - like `` chromo - metric '' field ( @xmath16 the properly normalized gluon ) @xcite : @xmath17    it will be useful for the applications to separate the `` flat connection '' @xmath18 , i.e. the zero - mode of the field . writing for the curvature or field strength",
    "@xmath19 we define @xmath20 where @xmath18 is the constant component , yielding a vanishing field strength .",
    "such a vacuum solution might be of the instanton type , for instance .",
    "consider , e.g. the first nontrivial class , with pontryagin index @xmath21 .",
    "expand around this classical configuration , working , as always for instantons , in a euclidean metric ( i.e. a tunneling solution in minkowski spacetime ) . at large distances the instanton field",
    "is required to approach a constant value @xmath22 with the @xmath23 field representing a fluctuation around the constant value , vanishing at large distances .",
    "one can construct the constant vacuum solution by mapping @xmath24 , namely directly onto the complete euclidean manifold , compactified by the addition of a point at infinity .",
    "@xmath3 acts as a `` pseudo - metric '' field , ( passively ) gauging effective `` pseudo - diffeomorphisms '' , just as is done by the physical einstein metric field for the `` true '' diffeomorphisms of the covariance group .",
    "the variation of the chromo - metric under color-@xmath2 , due to @xmath25 ( we use the adjoint representation @xmath26 ) reads @xmath27    the last bracket vanishes , since it represents the homogeneous @xmath2 transformation of the @xmath2 scalar expression , i.e. @xmath28 ( or , more technically , due to the total antisymmetry of @xmath29 in a compact group ) .",
    "we note that at the ir region distances , any gauss theorem field - fluxes will only involve the @xmath30 constant component , whereas the @xmath31  fluctuation \" will not contribute . as a result ,",
    "when integrating by parts the terms in @xmath32 we get @xmath33 an expression whose fourier transform vanishes for @xmath34 , i.e. in the infrared sector",
    ". a generalized definition of this  ir limit \" will be addressed below .",
    "the terms involving the constant @xmath18 , @xmath35 can be rewritten in terms of effective pseudo - diffeomorphisms , defined by @xmath36    _ thus , the local @xmath2 color gauge variations contain a subsystem ensuring that the @xmath3 di - gluon indeed act as a `` pseudo - metric '' field , precisely emulating gravity_.    the definition of our `` ir limit '' based on the vanishing of the @xmath37-momenta of the ` fluctuating fields ' @xmath38  after an integration by parts in which only the constant fields @xmath18 contribute to the surface terms  will be extended so as to include similar terms with vanishing momenta in all many - gluon zero - color exchanges .",
    "this can be taken as an operational definition , sufficient for our general purpose . to gain some additional insight ,",
    "however , we remind the reader that such an ir approximation of qcd can also be thought of as the first step , the `` zeroth approximation '' , of a _ strong coupling _ regime  in terms of a `` small parameter '' representing the number of `` hard '' , or nonsoft , virtual quanta held in the evaluation of any physical quantity .",
    "we can write a generic ir state , carrying @xmath37-momentum @xmath39 , as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents a state of @xmath42 soft gluons ( @xmath43 ) . integrating by parts ( with surface terms again appearing only for the constant parts ) ,",
    "the matrix elements of the terms in @xmath38 , @xmath44 become in this ir approximation @xmath45 an expression that is proportional to the soft @xmath46-gluon momentum , and that vanishes for @xmath47 , i.e. , in the infrared sector . as a result ,",
    "when changing over to the @xmath48 variable of and reidentifying @xmath49 as a variation under a formal @xmath50 diffeomorphism , we get @xmath51 . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we note that in general one has to consider expressions of the following form @xmath52 we evaluate such expressions , in this ir approximation , by inserting a complete set of states , and retaining only the _ soft _ virtual quanta .",
    "it is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite that by making use of the fradkin representation @xcite for relevant green s functions one has a continuous family of `` soft '' , or ir approximations , which maintain gauge invariance .",
    "thus , one finds a consistent gauge - invariant ( strong coupling ) ir approximation with dressed gluon propagators which incorporate the iteration of all relevant quark bubbles , each carrying all possible internal , soft - gluon lines .",
    "the consistency of this ir approximation requires one to consider only those qcd variations that connect ir gluon configurations _ mutually_.",
    "let us consider the expression for the @xmath53 variation , i.e. @xmath54 the left hand side of this expression is a difference between two soft gluons , implying that the ir matrix elements of its partial derivative are soft .",
    "thus , we find the following `` ir constraint '' on the qcd gauge parameters : @xmath55",
    "let us now consider the multi - gluon colorless configurations @xcite .",
    "the color - singlet @xmath9-gluon field operator has the following form @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath15 is the dressed gluon field , @xmath59 is the @xmath2 cartan metric , and @xmath60 is the @xmath2 totally symmetric @xmath61 tensor .    but taking fourier transforms  i.e. the matrix elements for these gluon fluctuations  we find that _ these terms are precisely those that vanish in our definition of an ir region_. the terms involving the constant connections @xmath62 , @xmath63 can be rewritten in terms of effective pseudo - diffeomorphisms ,    the qcd variation , in the ir region can be rewritten in terms of effective pseudo - diffeomorphisms , @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes symmetrization of indices , @xmath66 while @xmath62 , @xmath63 , being the constant connections .    a subsequent application of two @xmath2-induced variations , i.e. the commutator of two such chromo - diffeomorphic variations @xmath67 g^{(n)}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}\\cdots\\mu_{n } } = \\delta_{\\epsilon_{3 } } g^{(n)}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}\\cdots\\mu_{n}},\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath68 g^{(n)}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}\\cdots\\mu_{n } } = \\delta_{\\xi_{3 } } g^{(n)}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}\\cdots\\mu_{n}},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 indeed closes on the covariance group s commutation relations .",
    "thus , one has an infinitesimal nonlinear realization of the @xmath56 group in the space of fields @xmath70 .",

    "let us point out that there exists a subalgebra of the entire algebra when @xmath42-values are even , i.e. one has the following structure @xmath92 \\subset l^{(even ) } , \\\\   & & [ l^{(even ) } , l^{(odd ) } ] \\subset l^{(odd ) } , \\\\   & & [ l^{(odd ) } , l^{(odd ) } ] \\subset l^{(even)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us define the dilation - like operator ( chromo - dilation ) @xmath93 as a trace of @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 this operator commutes with the @xmath94 operators , @xmath96 = 0,\\ ] ] and belongs to the center of the @xmath97 chromo - gravity subalgebra generated by the @xmath94 operators .",
    "on account of the chromo - dilation operator one can make the following decomposition @xmath98 where @xmath93 corresponds to the subalgebra @xmath99 , while the basis of the @xmath100 subalgebra is given by @xmath101    the commutation relation of @xmath93 with a generic @xmath91 operator @xmath77 reads @xmath102 = m l^{(m)\\rho}_{\\nu_{1}\\nu_{2}\\cdots\\nu_{m+1}}\\ ] ] and thus , the chromo - dilation operator @xmath93 provides us with a @xmath103 grading .",
    "this grading justifies and/or explains the @xmath42-label used for the @xmath77 operators .",
    "the chromo - dilation operator @xmath93 counts the number of single gluon fields in a multi - gluon configuration , as seen from the following commutation relation @xmath104 = n g^{(n)}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}\\cdots\\mu_{n}}.\\ ] ]    clearly , the @xmath105 yang - mills gauge of qcd contains ( in the ir limit ) local diffeomorphisms , gauged  la einstein . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this is not surprising , as the truncated massless sector of the open string reduces to a @xmath105 yang - mills field theory and that the same truncation for the closed string reduces to a @xmath106 gravitational field theory ; but the closed string is nothing but the contraction of two open strings !",
    "the effective qcd interaction fields @xmath3 couple to the hadron systems themselves , and thus , in order to complete the chromogravity approximation of the qcd ir region , we have to address the question of the effective hadron fields as well .",
    "it is well known that the constructions of hadrons , i.e. the composite objects made of quarks and gluons , is due to the strong coupling regime one of the most challenging issues in qcd .",
    "thus , in order to define the effective hadron fields of chromogravity we rely as much as possible on the symmetry considerations .    the @xmath3 fields , that transform w.r.t . the second - rank symmetric representation of the @xmath56 group ,",
    "are naturally coupled to the bosonic and fermionic hadron fields that transform themselves w.r.t .",
    "representations of the @xmath56 group as well @xcite .",
    "the construction of the fermionic fields requires the study of the quantum - mechanical @xmath56 group , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "note that the topological properties of the @xmath56 group that determine nontrivial minimal group - extensions of the @xmath56 group by the @xmath108 group of the quantum - mechanical hilbert space phase factors @xmath109 are given by the corresponding properties of the group chain : @xmath110    it is well known that , in contradistinction to @xmath111 and @xmath112 cases , the @xmath113 group can not be embedded into any group of finite complex matrices , and that the universal covering of the @xmath113 group , i.e. @xmath4 , is a group of infinite matrices  likewise for the @xmath114 .",
    "the universal covering is actually given by the double covering , and the corresponding relations among relevant symmetry groups are as presented in the following diagram :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "an immediate consequence is that there are no finite - dimensional spinorial representations of the @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath114 group  _ all unitary and non - unitary spinorial representations of these groups are necessarily infinite - dimensional_. in practice , the @xmath4 representations are constructed by making use of the `` standard '' linear representations techniques , while the @xmath114 representations are induced from these @xmath4 representations .",
    "this fact fits very well with our chromogravity picture of hadrons , where the entire set of presumably infinitely many excitations of given flavor are to be described by a single infinite - component effective field  \" manifield  .    in order to set up all basic quantum mechanical objects , that are necessary for particle physics applications",
    ", we have to consider :    \\(i ) the fermionic and bosonic ( infinite - component ) representations of the @xmath4 group that characterize respectively the baryonic and mesonic quantum manifields ,    \\(ii ) the fermionic and bosonic ( infinite - component ) representations of the inhomogenious @xmath115 group ( affine generalization of the poincar group ) that characterize the quantum states of the manifields quanta ,    \\(iii ) the wave equation type relations that insure consistency between manifields and the corresponding quantum states , and    \\(iv ) the physical requirements that are primarily related to the unitarity properties of various observable facts .",
    "the affine group @xmath116 , is a semidirect product of translations generated by @xmath117 and @xmath4 generated by @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the antisymmetric operators @xmath120 generate the lorentz subgroup @xmath121 , while the symmetric traceless operators ( shears ) @xmath122 generate the proper @xmath37-volume - preserving deformations .",
    "as in the poincar case , the @xmath123 unitary irreducible representations are induced from the representations of the corresponding little group @xmath124 . in the physically most interesting case @xmath125",
    "is represented trivially .",
    "the corresponding particle states have to be described by the unitary representations of the remaining part of the little group , i.e. @xmath126 . all these representations , both spinorial and tensorial , are infinite - dimensional owing to the @xmath126 noncompactness .",
    "therefore , the corresponding @xmath4 matter fields @xmath127 are necessarily infinite - dimensional and when reduced with respect to the @xmath126 subgroup should transform with respect to its unitary irreducible quantum - states representations .",
    "if the whole @xmath4 group would be represented unitarily , the lorentz boost generators intrinsic part would be hermitian and as a result , when boosting a particle , one would obtain a particle with a different spin , i.e. another particle - contrary to experience .",
    "there exists however a remarkable inner _ deunitarizing _",
    "automorphism @xmath128 @xcite of the @xmath113 group , which leaves its @xmath129 subgroup intact , and which maps the @xmath130 , @xmath131 generators into @xmath132 , @xmath133 respectively ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "in other words it exchanges the @xmath135 and @xmath121 subgroups of the @xmath4 group mutually .",
    "the deunitarizing automorphism allows us to start with the unitary ( irreducible ) representations of the @xmath4 group , and upon its application , to identify the finite ( unitary ) representations of the `` abstract '' @xmath135 compact subgroup with nonunitary representations of the physical lorentz group  @xmath136 . in this way",
    ", we avoid a disease common to most of infinite - component wave equations , in particular those based on groups containing the @xmath4 group .",
    "the catalogue of the @xmath4 multiplicity - free unitary irreducible representations is presented in @xcite , and by making use of the deunitarizing automorphism @xmath137 , we arrive at the infinite - dimensional @xmath4 representations for which the lorentz subgroup is represented nonunitarily . moreover , for the relevant cases the lorentz - covariant ( flat - space ) infinite - component wave equations which determine the physical ( propagating ) degrees of freedom are given in @xcite , and thus we can proceed with the actual applications to hadron classification .    in the case of mesons",
    "there are two @xmath4 representations at our disposal : @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "having in mind the quark model , it is most natural to classify the @xmath140 meson states according to the @xmath139 representation , i.e. , to have as the lowest level the @xmath141 ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) states",
    ". the @xmath138 representation would be an appropriate choice for the possible glueballs . in the case of baryons , for the flavor",
    "@xmath2 octet states we have a unique choice of the system based on the @xmath144^{{\\cal a}}$ ] system , while for the decuplet states we have to make use of the symmetrized product of this reducible representation and the finite - dimensional @xmath4 representation @xmath145 ( generalizing the rarita - schwinger approach ) .",

    "all states of the same @xmath126 subgroup unitary irreducible representation ( regge trajectory ) thus have the same parity ; the states of an @xmath151 or an @xmath135 subgroup representation have alternating parities . for a given @xmath152 representation ( @xmath153 ) ,",
    "the total ( spin ) angular momentum is @xmath154 while the boost operator is given by @xmath155 we find the following @xmath156 content of a @xmath157 @xmath158 representation : @xmath159 thus , by assigning a given parity to any state of an @xmath4 representation , say the lowest state , the parities of all other states are determined .    the @xmath126 subgroup unitary irreducible representations @xcite determine the regge trajectory states of a given @xmath160 representation . in decomposing an @xmath160 representation with respect to the @xmath126 unitary irreducible representations ,",
    "it is convenient to use an integer quantum number @xmath9 that is in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath148 operator eigen values .",
    "the @xmath4 ladder unitary irreducible representations contain an infinite sum of @xmath126 ladder unitary irreducible representations , i.e. , @xmath161 @xmath162 an analysis shows that the reduction of the @xmath163 and @xmath164 representations with respect to the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath126 is given by the symbolic expression @xmath165 each @xmath126 unitary irreducible representation appears infinitely many times .",
    "we find it necessary , from a comparison with the experimental situation , to use parity doubling , the actual spectrum displaying approximate exchange - degeneracy features .",
