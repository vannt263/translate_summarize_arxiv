    "the differentiation matrix is used for finding the jacobian and stability matrices .",
    "notice that the grid for finite differences discretization is the same as in the fourier collocation ; and , in addition , there is a differentiation matrix for the finite differences method , i.e.    @xmath96    with @xmath97 being kronecker s delta .",
    "it can be observed from the above discussion that in the fourier spectral method , the banded differentiation matrix of the finite differences method is substituted by a dense matrix , or , in other words , a nearest - neighbor interaction is exchanged for into a long - range one .",
    "the lack of sparsity of differentiation matrices is one of the drawbacks of spectral methods , especially when having to diagonalize large systems .",
    "however , they have the advantage of needing ( a considerably ) smaller number of grid points @xmath88 for getting the same accuracy as with finite difference methods .    for fixed ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions , the chebyshev spectral methods are the most suitable ones .",
    "there are several collocation schemes , the gauss - lobato being the most extensively used :    @xmath98    with @xmath88 being even or odd .",

    "this fact naturally reduces the efficiency of the method when performing numerical time - integration .",
    "however , it presents a higher spectral accuracy than the fourier collocation method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several modifications must be introduced when applying spectral methods to polar coordinates .",
    "they basically rely on overcoming the difficulty of not having dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath101 and the singularity of the equations at that point .",
    "in addition , in the case of the dirac equation , the spinor components can be either symmetric or anti - symmetric in their radial dependence , so the method described in @xcite must be modified accordingly . as shown in the previously mentioned references ,",
    "the radial derivative of a general function @xmath102 can be expressed as :    @xmath103    notice that in this case , the collocation points must be taken as    @xmath104    but only the first @xmath88 points are taken so that the domain of the radial coordinate does not include @xmath101 .",
    "analogously the differentiation matrix would possess now @xmath105 components , but only the upper half of the matrix , of size @xmath106 is used .",
    "if the function that must be derived is symmetric or anti - symmetric , i.e. @xmath107 , with the upper ( lower ) sign corresponding to the ( anti-)symmetric function , equation ( [ supp_eq : polar1 ] ) can be written as :    @xmath108\\ ] ]    thus , the differentiation matrix has a different form depending whether @xmath102 is symmetric or anti - symmetric :    @xmath109    with @xmath110 defined as in ( [ supp_eq : polar2 ] ) .",
    "having established the basic features of spectral methods , we have enough tools for undertaking the numerical analysis of stationary states for the nonlinear dirac equation .",
    "we recall that the dynamical equations in polar coordinates read as :    @xmath111\\psi_1 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "i\\partial_t\\psi_2 & = & -{\\mathrm{e}}^{i\\theta}\\left(i\\partial_r-\\frac{\\partial_\\theta}{r}\\right)\\psi_1-[1-(|\\psi_1|^2-|\\psi_2|^2)^k]\\psi_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and stationary solutions can be written in the form @xmath112 with @xmath113      \\phi_2(r,\\theta )      \\end{array}\\right )      =      \\left(\\begin{array}{c }      v(r){\\mathrm{e}}^{i s\\theta } \\\\[1ex ]      i\\,u(r){\\mathrm{e}}^{i(s+1)\\theta }      \\end{array}\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 could be chosen real - valued .",
    "thus , the equations for the stationary solutions read :    @xmath114v   , \\nonumber \\\\      \\omega u & = & -\\left(\\partial_r-\\frac{s}{r}\\right ) v-[1-(v^2-u^2)^k]u , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath115 .",
    "there are no analytical solutions available for this system . for this reason , numerical methods",
    "must be used to this aim . among them",
    "we have chosen to use fixed point methods , as the newton - raphson one @xcite , which requires the transformation of the set of two coupled ordinary differential equations ( [ supp_eq : stat ] ) into a set of @xmath116 algebraic equations ; this is performed by defining the set of collocation points @xmath117 , and transforming the derivatives into multiplication of the differentiation matrices @xmath118 and @xmath119 times the vectors @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively , being @xmath122 and @xmath123 as explained in the previous section .",

    "<S> introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the context of dispersive nonlinear wave equations , admittedly the prototypical model that has attracted a wide range of attention in optics , atomic physics , fluid mechanics , condensed matter and mathematical physics is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls )  @xcite . by comparison , </S>",
    "<S> far less attention has been paid to its relativistic analogue , the nonlinear dirac equation ( nld )  @xcite , despite its presence for almost 80 years in the context of high - energy physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is slowly starting to change , arguably , for three principal reasons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , significant steps have been taken in the nonlinear analysis of stability of such models  @xcite , especially in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , computational advances have enabled a better understanding of the associated solutions and their dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , and perhaps most importantly , nld starts emerging in physical systems which arise in a diverse set of contexts of considerable interest . </S>",
    "<S> these contexts include , in particular , bosonic evolution in honeycomb lattices  @xcite and a growing class of atomically thin 2d dirac materials  @xcite such as graphene , silicene , germanene and transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the physical aspects of nonlinear optics , such as light propagation in honeycomb photorefractive lattices ( the so - called photonic graphene )  @xcite have prompted the consideration of intriguing dynamical features , e.g. conical diffraction in 2d honeycomb lattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of nonlinearity is then quite natural in these models , although in a number of them ( e.g. , in atomic and optical physics ) the nonlinearity does not couple the spinor components .    </S>",
    "<S> these physical aspects have also led to a discussion of potential 2d solutions of nld in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a systematic and definitive characterization of stability and nonlinear dynamical evolution of the prototypical coherent structures in nld models is still lacking , to the best of our knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> the present work is dedicated to offering analytical and numerical insights into these crucial mathematical and physical aspects of higher - dimensional nonlinear dirac equations bearing in mind the physical relevance and potential observability of such waveforms . </S>",
    "<S> as our model of choice , in order to also be able to compare and contrast with the multitude of existing 1d results ( e.g. @xcite ) , we select the well - established soler model  @xcite ( known in 1d as the gross  neveu model  @xcite ) , which is a dirac equation with scalar self - interaction . such self - interaction is based on including into the lagrangian density a function of the quantity @xmath0 ( which transforms as a scalar under the lorentz transformations ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are @xmath8 dirac @xmath9-matrices satisfying the anticommutation relations @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the minkowski tensor  @xcite , and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the clifford algebra theory gives the relation @xmath13}$ ] between the spatial dimension and spinor components ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * chapter 1 ,  5.3 ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity of the model is generalized in the spirit of  @xcite , by using @xmath14 with @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of existence of solitary waves in this model ( in 3d ) is in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the nld in 2d admits different solutions involving a structure of vorticity @xmath16 in the first spinor component , with the other spinor component bearing a vorticity @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify such solutions for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> while prior stability results have often been inconclusive ( particularly in higher dimensions , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , our numerical computation of the spectrum of the corresponding linearization operator reveals that _ only _ the @xmath19 solutions can be spectrally stable ( the spectrum of the linearization contains no eigenvalues with positive real part ) , and that this stability takes place in a rather wide interval of the frequency of the solitary waves . on the contrary , we find that the states of higher vorticity are generically linearly unstable . complementing the stability analysis results , our direct dynamical evolution studies show that the unstable higher vorticity solutions break up into lower vorticity waveforms , yet conserving the total vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the fundamental @xmath19 solutions are found to be potentially stable in models both with a higher order ( quintic ) two - dimensional nonlinearity , as well as in higher dimensions ( 3d ) under cubic nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> these features again reflect differences from the nls model and as such suggest the particular interest towards a broader and deeper study of nld models .    an important extension of our stability findings for higher dimensional @xmath19 solutions , is that they remain valid for other types of nonlinearities . </S>",
    "<S> these include non - lorentz - invariant ones such as most notably those arising in atomic  @xcite , and optical  @xcite problems . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental difference of those models is that they correspond to _ massless _ equations , contrary to the soler model . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we have confirmed our stability conclusions by comparison with those emerging from the model for square binary waveguides @xcite which leads to a _ massive _ nonlinear dirac equation with the same nonlinearity as in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ theoretical setup . </S>",
    "<S> we start from the prototypical 2d nonlinear dirac equation system , derived from the lagrangian density ( [ nld - lagrangian ] ) with @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the components of the spinor @xmath25 and the nonlinearity is @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that is a @xmath27-invariant , translation - invariant hamiltonian system .    </S>",
    "<S> we simplify our analysis by using the polar coordinates , where eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dyn ] ) takes the form @xmath28 the form of this equation suggests that we look for solutions as @xmath29 with @xmath30 , \\label{ansatz}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 and @xmath32 real - valued . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath16 can be cast as the vorticity of the first spinor component .    </S>",
    "<S> once solitary waves have been identified , we explore their stability . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has been previously developed in related settings including the multi - component nls ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as a massless variant of the dirac equation of  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a mass in our case allows not only a direct comparison with nls ( when @xmath33 ) , but also generates fundamental differences between our results and those of  @xcite , as discussed below as well .    to examine its spectral stability </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a solution @xmath34 in the form of a perturbed solitary wave solution : @xmath35 { \\mathrm{e}}^{-i\\omega t},\\ ] ] with @xmath36 a small perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the linearized equation on @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 and with a matrix - valued first order differential operator @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the spectrum of the linearization operator @xmath41 contains an eigenvalue @xmath42 with @xmath43 , we say that the solitary wave is linearly unstable ; in such cases , we resort to dynamical simulations of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dyn ] ) to explore the outcome of the unstable evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if there are no such eigenvalues , the solitary wave is called spectrally stable .    </S>",
    "<S> a convenient feature of nls ground states is that the linearization operator at such states , albeit non - selfadjoint , has its point spectrum confined to the real and imaginary axes . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is at the base of the vk criterion @xcite : a linear instability can thus develop when a positive eigenvalue bifurcates from @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the loss of stability due to the appearance of a pair of positive and a pair of negative eigenvalues follows the jump in size of the jordan block corresponding to the unitary invariance ; this happens when the vk condition @xmath45 is satisfied , with @xmath46 being the charge of a solitary wave .    </S>",
    "<S> crucially , in the nld case , the spectrum of the linearization at a solitary wave is no longer confined to the real and imaginary axes ; the linear stability analysis requires that one studies the _ whole complex plane_. the key observation is that @xmath41 in contains @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , but not @xmath50 ; this allows to perform a detailed study of the spectrum of @xmath41 using the decomposition of spinors into fourier harmonics corresponding to different @xmath51 @xcite .    in the 3d case , we are not yet able to perform the general spectral analysis , but we studied the part of spectrum in the invariant subspace corresponding to perturbations of the same angular structure as the solitary waves @xcite , @xmath52,iu(r)[\\cos\\theta , e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta]]^t$ ] ; this invariant subspace seems most important since it is responsible for the linear instability in the non - relativistic limit @xmath53 which is a consequence of the instability of the 3d cubic nls .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     </S>",
    "<S> it is especially interesting that a wide parametric ( over frequencies ) interval of stability of solitary waves can _ also _ be observed in the quintic ( @xmath54 ) nld case ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra - n2k2-n3k1 ] ) ; while the quintic nls solitary waves blow up ( even in one dimension ) , the quintic nld solitary waves are stable even in two dimensions , except for the interval @xmath55 where the coherent structures experience the same hopf bifurcation as in the cubic case , and for @xmath56 where an exponential instability created by radial @xmath57 perturbations emerges . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps even more remarkably , the right panel of the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra - n2k2-n3k1 ] illustrates that this stability of nld solitons against radial perturbations can be found in suitable frequency intervals _ even in 3d _ ( see @xcite for a discussion of the equations for existence and stability of radial perturbations in 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> both of the above cases ( quintic 2d and cubic 3d nld ) are charge - supercritical i.e. , the charge goes to infinity in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the pure - power supercritical nls whose solitary waves remain linearly unstable for all frequencies , solitary waves in the soler model become spectrally stable when @xmath59 drops below some dimension - dependent critical value @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant unstable eigenvalue ( associated with @xmath57 and radially - symmetric collapse ) is only present as real for @xmath61 , where @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this was identified in @xcite as the value at which both the energy and charge of solitary waves have a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we indeed find that the radially - symmetric collapse - related instability ceases to be present below this critical point </S>",
    "<S> . finally , as regards two dimensions , @xmath63 vortices are unstable for every @xmath59 , because of the presence in the spectrum of quadruplets of complex eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> these quadruplets emerge ( and disappear ) for different values of @xmath64 via direct ( inverse hopf ) bifurcations ; see the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum for @xmath65 vortex is quite similar to that of @xmath63 ; for this reason , we do not analyze it further .    in order to analyze the result of instabilities in 2d settings </S>",
    "<S> , we have probed the dynamics of unstable solutions directly ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> prototypical examples of unstable @xmath19 solitary waves and @xmath63 vortices for @xmath20 are shown in figs . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : dyns0 ] and [ fig : dyns12 ] . as can be observed , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 solitary waves spontaneously amplify perturbations breaking the radial symmetry in their density and , as a result , become elliptical and rotate around the center of the circular density of the original solitary wave in line with the expected amplification of the @xmath66 unstable eigenmode . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the @xmath63 vortices split into three smaller ones . </S>",
    "<S> let us mention that in the latter case , the first spinor component splits into structures without angular dependence , whereas the second component splits into corresponding ones with angular dependence @xmath67 , in accordance with the ansatz of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ansatz ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this preserves the total vorticity across the two components , as is also shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dyns12 ] . along a similar vein </S>",
    "<S> , the instability of an @xmath65 vortex eventually leads to the emergence of five @xmath68 pairs , again preserving the total vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have analyzed the outcome of the instabilities caused by radially - symmetric perturbations in the @xmath54 case for @xmath69 ( see fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> _ we have illustrated that solitary waves of vorticity @xmath19 in one spinor component and @xmath63 in the other are _ spectrally stable within a large parametric interval _ , suggesting their physical relevance . in that connection </S>",
    "<S> , we highlight that although our models of choice may bear a particular nonlinearity , our results suggest that under different nonlinearities including the more physically relevant ones of e.g. ,  @xcite and massive models  @xcite _ still _ bear stable solitary waves for a suitable _ wide parametric range _ of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the conclusion of higher dimensional stability is more general than the specifics of our particular nonlinearity and hence of broad interest . </S>",
    "<S> we also showcased the significant difference of nld from the focusing nls equation , where solitary waves are linearly unstable in the charge - supercritical cases . when the nld solutions were found to be unstable , their dynamical evolution suggested breathing oscillations in the @xmath19 case and splitting into lower charge configurations for @xmath63 and @xmath65 .    </S>",

    "<S> , it would be useful to explore further the 3d stability and associated dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially timely given that the 3d analogue of photonic graphene has been experimentally realized very recently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> admittedly , the latter setting does not feature a mass in the model , thus the generalization of nld models such as those appearing in the works of  @xcite would be particularly important there . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be of interest to compare more systematically the present findings with models associated with different nonlinearities , including the case of honeycomb lattices in atomic and optical media or , e.g. , those stemming from wave resonances in low - contrast photonic crystals  @xcite .    </S>",
