    "periodic and quasi - periodic for the @xmath0-body problem have received much of attention over the last years , also because of the success of variational and topological methods .",
    "the starting point can be traced back to the nonlinear analysis works of a. ambrosetti , a. bahri , v. coti - zelati , p. majer , j. mawin , p.h .",
    "rabinowitz , e. serra and s. terracini ( among others ) issued around 1990 @xcite ; methods were developed that could deal with singular potential and particular symmetry groups of the functional . for other approaches one can see also i. stewart @xcite and c. moore @xcite .",
    "the next new wave of results has followed the remarkable a. chenciner and r. montgomery s proof of the `` figure - eight '' periodic solution of the three - body problem in the case of equal masses @xcite , where collisions and singularities were excluded by the computation of the action level on test curves and a non - commutative finite group of symmetries was taken as the constraint for a global equivariant variational approach . in order to generalize the equivariant variational method ( that is , to restrict the action functional to the space of equivariant loops ) to a new range of applicability s. terracini and the author in @xcite could make use of c. marchal s averaging idea @xcite and prove that local minimizers of the action functional are collisionless , provided an algebraic condition on the symmetry group ( termed the _ rotating circle property _ ) holds .",
    "meanwhile , symmetry groups and various approaches to level estimates or local variations have been found , together with the corresponding symmetric minimizers , and published by many authors ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to provide a unified framework for the construction and classification problem and at the same time to extend the application range of the averaging and blow - up techniques .",
    "more precisely , when dealing with the problem of classifying in a constructive way finite symmetry groups for the @xmath0-body problem one has to face three issues .",
    "first , it is of course preferrable to have an equivalence relation defined between groups , which rules out differences thought as non  substantial .",
    "second , one has to find a suitable decomposition of a symmetry group into a sum of ( something like ) _ irreducible _ components .",
    "the way of decomposing things depends upon the context . in our settings",
    "we could choose an orthogonal representations decomposition ( as direct sum of @xmath1-modules ) or as permutations decomposition , or a mixture of the two .",
    "third , it would be interesting to deduce from the irreducible components , from their ( algebraic and combinatorial ) properties , some consequente properties of action - minimizing periodic orbits ( like being collisionless , existence , being homographic or non - homographic , and the like ) .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to give a procedure for constructing all symmetry groups of the @xmath0-body problem ( in three - dimensional space , but of course the planar case can be done as a particular case ) according to these three options , with the main focus on the existence of periodic or quasi - periodic non - colliding solutions .",
    "the main result can be used to list groups that might be considered as the elementary building blocks for generic symmetry groups yielding collisionless minimizers .",
    "the first reduction will be obtained by defining the _ cover _ of a symmetry group ( that is , the group acting on the time line instead of the time circle ) and considering equivalent groups with the same equivariant periodic trajectories ( up to repeating loops ) .",
    "also , it is possible to consider equivalent those symmetry groups that differ by a change in the action functional ( the angular speed ) . using this simple _ escamotage _ it is possible to dramatically reduce the cardinality of the symmetry groups and to deal with a finite number of ( numerable ) families of groups for every @xmath0 .",
    "the next step is to exploit the fact that any finite permutation representation can be decomposed _",
    " la burnside _ into the disjoint sum of _ transitive _ ( or , equivalently , _ homogeneous _ ) permutation representations .",
    "this decomposition requires the definition of a suitably crafted sum of lagrangean symmetry groups , which will be written in term of @xmath2 and @xmath3 data ( to be defined later ) yielded by the group .",
    "the transitive decomposition allows to state the main result , which can be written as follows .",
    "definition and notation of course refer to the body of the paper .",
    "[ theo : main ] let @xmath1 be a symmetry group with a colliding @xmath1-symmetric lagrangean local minimizer .",
    "if @xmath4 is the @xmath5-isotropy group of the colliding time restricted to the index subset of colliding bodies , then @xmath4 can not act trivially on the index set ; if the permutation isotropy of a transitive component of @xmath4 is trivial , than the image of @xmath4 in @xmath6 can not be one of the following : @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( for @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this result allows to clarify and to extend the above - mentioned _ rotating circle property _ ; in the proof we show how with a simple application of the averaging marchal technique on space equivariant spheres one can deduce that for the group actions listed in the statement minimizers are collisionless .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the transitive decomposition approach has two interesting consequences : from one hand it is possible to determine whether the hypothesis of theorem [ theo : main ] is fulfilled simply by computing the space - representations of the transitive decomposition of the maximal @xmath5-isotropy subgroups of the symmetry group ( thus making the task of finding rotating circles unnecessary ) ; on the other hand a machinery for finding examples of symmetry groups can be significantly improved by allowing the construction of actions using smaller and combinatorial components .",
    "even if feasible , a complete classification of all symmetry groups satistying the hypotheses which imply collision - less minimizers and coercivity would just result into an unreasonably long unreadable list .",
    "we decided to formulate only the method that can be used for such generation , leaving a few examples in the last section to illustrate it in simple cases .",
    "therefore the paper is basically organized as a multi - step proof of theorem [ theo : main ] , together with the introduction and explanation of the necessary preliminaries , results and definitions . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we will review the notation about euclidean symmetry groups and the main properties of lagrangean symmetry groups . in section 4 the definition of transitive decomposition and disjoint sum of symmetry groups",
    "is carried out : this is the one of the main step in the construction process . furthermore , in section 5 a simple proof allows to extend the averaging technique to all orientation - preserving finite isotropy groups . together with the rotating circle property and the classification of finite subgroups of @xmath17",
    "this will yield the method on avoiding collisions .",
    "the analysis of possible transitive component is then carried out in section 6 , according to the previous definition and results . at the end , in section 7",
    "the few examples mentioned above are shown , together with pictures of the corresponding approximate minimizers .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the orthogonal group in dimension @xmath19 , that is , the group of @xmath20 orthogonal matrices over the real field .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 denotes the permutation group on @xmath0 elements @xmath22 .",
    "space isometries are named _ rotation _ , _ reflection _ , _ central inversion _ and _ rotatory reflection _",
    "( actually a central inversion is a particular rotatory reflection ) .",
    "we recall , following the terminology and notation of @xcite ( page 99 , pages 270277 ) and @xcite ( appendix a , pages 351367 ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) , that the non - trivial finite subgroups of @xmath17 are the following : @xmath8 ( the cyclic group generated by a rotation of order @xmath23 , for @xmath11 , with a single @xmath23-gonal axis ) , @xmath10 ( the dihedral group of order @xmath24 , with @xmath23 horizontal digonal axes and a vertical @xmath23-gonal axis , with @xmath11 ) , @xmath25 ( the tetrahedral group of order @xmath26 , with @xmath27 trigonal axes and @xmath28 mutually orthogonal digonal axes ) , @xmath29 ( the octahedral group of order @xmath30 , with @xmath27 trigonal axes , the same as @xmath12 , and @xmath28 mutually orthogonal tetragonal axes ; it is isomorphic to the orientation - preserving symmetry group of the cube and contains the tetrahedral group as a normal subgroup of index @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( the icosahedral group of order @xmath33 , with @xmath34 pentagonal axes , @xmath35 trigonal axes and @xmath36 digonal axes ) .",

    "since @xmath39 and @xmath7 is the center of @xmath6 , finite groups containing the central inversion are @xmath7 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
