    "capturing dynamical patterns of stock prices are major challenges both for epistemologists as well as for financial analysts @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of their ( time ) variations or fluctuations @xcite are now well studied and characterized ( with established fractal properties ) , but are not very useful for studying and anticipating their dynamics in the market . noting that a single fractal gives essentially a time averaged picture , a minimal two - fractal overlap time series model was introduced @xcite to capture the time series of earthquake magnitudes .",
    "we find that the same model can be used to mimic and study the essential features of the time series of stock prices .",
    "let us consider first a geometric model  @xcite of the fault dynamics occurring in overlapping tectonic plates that form the earth s lithosphere . a geological fault",
    "is created by a fracture in the earth s rock layers followed by a displacement of one part relative to the other .",
    "the two surfaces of the fault are known to be self - similar fractals . in the model considered here  @xcite , a fault is represented by a pair of overlapping identical fractals and the fault dynamics arising out of the relative motion of the associated tectonic plates is represented by sliding one of the fractals over the other ; the overlap @xmath0 between the two fractals represents the energy released in an earthquake whereas @xmath1 represents the magnitude of the earthquake . in the simplest form of the model",
    "each of the two identical fractals is represented by a regular cantor set of fractal dimension @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "ccb : fig : generatio ] ) .",
    "this is the only exactly solvable model for earthquakes known so far .",
    "the exact analysis of this model @xcite for a finite generation @xmath3 of the cantor sets with periodic boundary conditions showed that the probability of the overlap @xmath0 , which assumes the values @xmath4 , follows the binomial distribution @xmath5 of @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath7    since the index of the central term ( i.e. , the term for the most probable event ) of the above distribution is @xmath8 , @xmath9 , for large values of @xmath3 eq .",
    "( [ eq : binomial - regular ] ) may be written as @xmath10    by replacing @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath13 , we can write the normal approximation to the above binomial distribution as @xmath14    since @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 } , \\label{eq : normal - approx'}\\ ] ]    not mentioning the factors that do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "now @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\label{eq : log - normal2}\\ ] ]    is the log - normal distribution of @xmath0 . as the generation index @xmath19 , the normal factor spreads indefinitely ( since its width is proportional to @xmath20 ) and becomes a very weak function of @xmath0 so that it may be considered to be almost constant ; thus @xmath21 asymptotically assumes the form of a simple power law with an exponent that is independent of the fractal dimension of the overlapping cantor sets  @xcite : @xmath22",
    "we now consider the time series @xmath23 of the overlap set ( of two identical fractals  @xcite ) , as one slides over the other with uniform velocity .",
    "let us again consider two regular cantor sets at finite generation @xmath3 .",
    "as one set slides over the other , the overlap set changes . the total overlap @xmath23 at any instant @xmath24 changes with time ( see fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu1](a ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu1](b ) we show the behavior of the cumulative overlap @xcite @xmath25 .",
    "this curve , for sets with generation @xmath26 , is approximately a straight line @xcite with slope @xmath27 . in general",
    ", this curve approaches a strict straight line in the limit @xmath28 , asymptotically , where the overlap set comes from the cantor sets formed of @xmath29 blocks , taking away the central block , giving dimension of the cantor sets equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the cumulative curve is then almost a straight line and has then a slope @xmath31^n$ ] for sets of generation @xmath3 . if one defines a ` crash ' occurring at time @xmath32 when @xmath33 ( a preassigned large value ) and one redefines the zero of the scale at each @xmath32 , then the behavior of the cumulative overlap @xmath34 , has got the peak value ` quantization ' as shown in fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu1](c ) .",
    "the reason is obvious .",
    "this justifies the simple thumb rule : one can simply count the cumulative @xmath35 of the overlaps since the last ` crash ' or ` shock ' at @xmath36 and if the value exceeds the minimum value ( @xmath37 ) , one can safely extrapolate linearly and expect growth upto @xmath38 here and face a ` crash ' or overlap greater than @xmath39 ( @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu1 ] ) .",
    "if nothing happens there , one can again wait upto a time until which the cumulative grows upto @xmath41 and feel a ` crash ' and so on ( @xmath42 in the set considered in fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu1 ] ) .",
    "we now consider some typical stock price time - series data , available in the internet .",
    "the data analyzed here are for the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) indices @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu2](a ) , we show that the daily stock price @xmath43 variations for about @xmath44 years ( daily closing price of the ` industrial index ' ) from january 1966 to december 1979 ( 3505 trading days ) .",
    "the cumulative @xmath45 has again a straight line variation with time @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu2](b ) ) .",
    "similar to the cantor set analogy , we then define the major shock by identifying those variations when @xmath46 of the prices in successive days exceeded a preassigned value @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu2](c ) ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath47 where @xmath32 are the times when @xmath48 show similar geometric series like peak values ( see fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu2](d ) ) ; see @xcite .",
    "we observed striking similarity between the ` crash ' patterns in the cantor set overlap model and that derived from the data set of the stock market index .",
    "for both cases , the magnitude of crashes follow a similar pattern  the crahes occur in a geometric series .    a simple ` anticipation strategy ' for some of the crashes may be as follows : if the cumulative @xmath49 since the last crash has grown beyond @xmath50 here , wait until it grows ( linearly with time ) until about @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and expect a crash there . if nothing happens , then wait until @xmath49 grows ( again linearly with time ) to a value of the order of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and expect a crash , and so on .    the same kind of analysis for the nyse ` utility index ' , for the same period , is shown in figs .",
    "[ ccb : figu3 ] .",
    "unlike in the case of stock price time series where accurate data are easily available , the time series for earthquake magnitudes @xmath55 at any fault involves considerably coordinated measurements and comparable accuracies are not easily achievable . still from the available data , as in the case of stock market ( where the integrated stock price @xmath56 shows clear linear variations with time and this fits well with that for the cumulative overlap @xmath57 for the fractal overlap model ; see also @xcite ) , the integrated earthquake magnitude @xmath58 of the aftershocks does also show such prominent linear variations ( see fig .",
    "[ ccb : figu4 ] ) .",
    "we believe , the slopes of these linear @xmath59 vs. @xmath24 curves for different faults would give us the signature of the corresponding fractal structure of the underlying fault .",
    "it may be noted in this context , in our model , the slope becomes @xmath60^n$ ] for an @xmath3th generation cantor set , formed out of the remaining @xmath29 blocks having the central block removed .",
    "based on the formal similarity between the two - fractal overlap model of earthquake time series and of the stock market , we considered here a detailed comparison .",
    "we find , the features of the time series for the overlap of two cantor sets when one set moves with uniform relative velocity over the other looks somewhat similar to the time series of stock prices . we analyze both and explore the possibilities of anticipating a large ( change in cantor set ) overlap or a large change in stock price . an anticipation method for some of the crashes has been proposed here , based on these observations ."
