    "recentry , we have discovered two kinds of _ strange tribaryons _ by measuring nucleon energy spectra from the stopped @xmath11 reaction on @xmath0he @xcite , which was motivated by the prediction of a deeply bound @xmath12 state by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite .",
    "the first kind , s@xmath2(3115 ) , was discovered in @xmath13 reaction @xcite . the observed state has isospin @xmath3 , charge @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 mev/@xmath5 .",
    "the second kind , s@xmath8(3140 ) , was indicated from @xmath16 reaction @xcite originally proposed to search for the @xmath12 state , which was predicted to be at @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 mev/@xmath5 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .    in this paper , we summarize the experimental results and compare them to some theories .",
    "we adopted the stopped @xmath11 method on @xmath0he to search for the predicted @xmath22 state @xcite . a stopped @xmath11 forms a kaonic atom and",
    "is absorbed by the nucleus after an electromagnetic cascade .",
    "if it , or more generally , strange tribaryonic states with @xmath21 which are denoted s@xmath8 , exist , they will be formed via @xmath23 and appear as distinct peaks in the emitted neutron energy spectrum . by this reaction , both @xmath20 and @xmath3 tribaryonic states can be populated . on the otherhand , by similar reaction , @xmath24 @xmath3 neutral tribaryonic states , s@xmath2 ,",
    "can be exclusively populated .",
    "those strange tribaryonic states are generally expected to decay strongly into @xmath25 , @xmath7 , or @xmath26 , and secondary charged particle @xmath27 or @xmath28 should appear in the final state .",
    "we measured the nucleon energy spectra by means of time of flight ( tof ) , in coincidence with incident kaons and secondary charged particles from the reaction .",
    "hence , it should be noted that measured spectra are _ semi - inclusive _ ones in that meaning . a detailed description of the experimental setup is given in refs @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0he(@xmath30 ) missing mass spectrum under semi - inclusive condition is given in fig .",
    "[ p_missingmass ] .",
    "the details of the analysis - identification of charged particle on neutron counters , tof analysis , _ etc _ , are given in ref .",
    "@xcite and a future publication .",
    "it exhibits a clear peak structure at around 3118 mev/@xmath5 on a broad continuum background which mainly originates from non - mesonic absorption process ( @xmath31 ) or subsequent @xmath32 decay ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote a bound nucleon and hyperon(@xmath38 ) , respectively . from the detailed analysis of the spectrum",
    ", it is clearly shown that this peak structure is not due to hypernuclear formation and its two - body decay , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the peak is assigned to the formation of a neutral strange tribaryonic state s@xmath2 with @xmath3 , which has never been observed @xcite .",
    "l10 cm     in order to determine the mass and width of the state , we fitted a gaussian peak plus a third - order polynomial background to the 19 data points in the peak region as indicated in the figure .",
    "the fit @xmath41 is 8.76 for 12 degrees of freedom and the statistical significance of the peak , defined as the signal area divided by its fit error , is 8.2 @xmath42 . the fitted mass is 3117.7 @xmath43 0.9(stat ) mev/@xmath5 , while our estimate for the systematic uncertainty in the absolute mass is @xmath44 mev/@xmath5 , and the observed state is denoted s@xmath2(3115 ) , expressing the mass in the name .",
    "the gaussian standard deviation in the fitting is 8.7 @xmath45 mev/_c_@xmath46 . the upper- and lower - limit of tof resolution , 300 and 200 psec , respectively ,",
    "correspond to a mass resolution of 8.6 and 6.4 mev/@xmath5 ( @xmath42 ) in the region of interest . using the lower limit of the instrumental resolution ,",
    "the natural width @xmath47 is evaluated to be smaller than 21.6 mev/@xmath5 at 95 @xmath48 confidence level .",
    "the main decay mode of the state is deduced to be @xmath7 from the study of secondary charged particle detected in coincidence with the signal , and its formation probability per stopped @xmath11 is estimated to be several@xmath49 .",
    "the branching ratios of the decay and the formation will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the measured neutron spectrum can be analyzed in connection with the proton spectrum . the @xmath0he(@xmath30 ) and @xmath0he(@xmath50 )",
    "spectra under higher - s / n and lower - s / n conditions are given in the top and bottom of fig .",
    "[ n_missingmass ] , respectively .",
    "a comprehensive description of higher- and lower - s / n conditions , which are the event selection criteria related to the vertex inconsistency and secondary charged particle momentum to achieve higher- and lower - s / n ratio , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "l9 cm        in comaprison of both the top and bottom , the total statistics between higher- and lower - s / n data points are set identically . on the top",
    ", we see a clear enhancement of the s@xmath2(3115 ) component in the comparison between higher- and lower - s / n data points , hence the proper work of the selection criteria is confirmed . on the bottom , an enhancement is observed at around 3140 mev/@xmath5 on a substantial continuum , which is expected to mainly originate from non - mesonic absorption process , and the structure indicates the formation of another kind of strange tribaryon , s@xmath8(3140 ) . in this case , no other processes can generate neutrons with similar momentum , so that the interpretation is somewhat straightforward .",
    "another peak candidate is found at around 3117 mev/@xmath5 , where the isobaric analogue state of s@xmath2(3115 ) , which is denoted s@xmath8(3115 ) tentatively , is expected .    in order to obtain the mass and width of the s@xmath8(3140 ) by a function fitting procedure to the spectrum , we assume two gaussians which individually represent the s@xmath8(3140 ) and s@xmath8(3115 ) , and an exponential background .",
    "we fix the center and @xmath42 of the second gaussian to those values of s@xmath2(3115 ) obtained by a global fitting of the spectrum as shown in the top , assuming a third - order polynomial background and a gaussian signal .",
    "it should be noted that the yield of s@xmath8(3115 ) is treated as a free parameter . in this functional fitting to the neutron higer - s / n spectrum , we obtain @xmath51 , the s@xmath8(3140 ) yield of @xmath52 counts , which results in a peak significance of 3.7 @xmath42 , a mass of @xmath53 mev/@xmath5 , and standard deviation of @xmath54 mev/@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting functions are overlayed on the higher - s / n data points . the systematic uncertainty of the absolute mass is estimated to be @xmath55 from the @xmath56 ambiguity due to the uncertainty of tof origin , and the upper limit of the natural width is deduced to be 21.6 mev/@xmath5 at 95 @xmath48 confidence level , by using the lower limit of missing mass resolution of the measurement , 4.5 mev/@xmath5(@xmath42 ) .",
    "the main decay modes of the state are @xmath57 and/or @xmath58 , according to the fact that the peak structure appears only if a fast secondary pion with @xmath59 mev/@xmath60 is detected in coincidence @xcite .",
    "the quantitative estimation of the formation probability is rather difficult , but it is expected to be similar to that of the s@xmath2(3115 ) in connection with the comparison of the yields between s@xmath8(3115 ) and s@xmath2(3115 ) .",
    "the total isospin of the s@xmath8(3140 ) is considered to be 0 as follows .",
    "assumig s@xmath8(3140 ) having had @xmath3 , we would obtain an equality , @xmath62 which would be easily deduced from the isospin relation , where @xmath63 denotes the formation ratio per stopped @xmath11 of each strange tribaryon with @xmath3 .",
    "this equality , or its equivalent expression , @xmath64 , would be almost directly converted to the one between the experimental yields , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the total yield of each state .",
    "this equality would claim that we should observe a peak structure at around 3140 mev/@xmath5 on the proton spectrum with larger yield than that of s@xmath2(3115 ) , but no such a significant structure has been observed , in fact .",
    "therefore , we assign 0 to the total isospin of the s@xmath2(3140 ) .",
    "the total isospin of the s@xmath2(3115 ) is 1 , while that of the s@xmath8(3140 ) is 0 .",
    "therefore , we do not have any simple relationship between the formation ratio of those two .",
    "if we look at the @xmath3 sector , it would seem strange at the first glance that s@xmath2(3115 ) has been observed with very large significance , while the indication of its isobalic analogue state , s@xmath8(3115 ) , is not definitive .",
    "now , we investigate this apparent contradiction . the formation ratios of the two @xmath3 analogue states populated by the reactions ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) are connected by a simple relationship which is deduced from the clebsch - gordan coefficients involving the two final states , @xmath67 now , the expected yields for both states in the experiment can be estimated by the relation , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote proton and neutron detection efficiency ( neutron detection efficiency at 10 mev electron equivalent ) of nc array , respectively , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are secondary charged particle detection probabilities by vertex detector system per primary decay , which are rather sensitive to the decay branching ratio of each state . the relative detection efficiency @xmath73 is known to be @xmath74 at around the energy region of interest , and we obtain @xmath75 assuming @xmath76 .",
    "we can compare this approximate relation with the results of the functional fittings already presented in fig .",
    "[ n_missingmass ] . in those fittings , we have obtained @xmath77 and @xmath78 counts , respectively , which are fairly consistent with the equality . * therefore , the large yield of s@xmath2(3115 ) does not contradict the fact that its isobaric analogue state has not appeared clearly on the neutron spectrum*.",
    "the properties of the observed strange tribaryons are tabulated below , together with the @xmath79 binding energies with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath81 rest mass for s@xmath2(3115 ) and s@xmath8(3140 ) , respectively .",
    "these results are compared to several theoretical calculations in the following .",
    "deeply bound @xmath82 state : :    on the standpoint of deeply bound kaonic nuclear state , the discovery    of the narrow and light s@xmath2(3115 ) state was quite    unexpected , because @xmath83    with a triton - like nuclear core @xmath84_{t=1/2}$ ] was    expected to be very shalow and broad in their original prediction    @xcite . on the other hand , possible existence of a narrow deeply    bound @xmath85 state with a    @xmath86_{t=3/2}$ ] core in which @xmath87 occupies    the nuclear @xmath88 orbit ,",
    "has been predicted @xcite .",
    "then , s@xmath2(3115 ) can be interpreted as the isobalic    analogue state of predicted    @xmath85 with    @xmath89 ,    @xmath90 , while    s@xmath8(3140 ) can be identified as the originally    predicted @xmath91 with    @xmath92 . a comparison between the    calculated and observed binding energies is given in fig .",
    "[ ex - th - comp ] . in the comparison , we meet two difficulties , namely , the    large difference of the binding energies up to @xmath93    mev and the level reversing between the @xmath20 and    @xmath3 states . however , it is pointed out that these    difficulties can be resolved by taking care of the relativistic effect    and by invoking an enhanced @xmath94 interaction and a    strong spin - orbit interaction in the dense nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "su(3 ) multiskirmion : :    on the framework of the skirmion description of multibaryon systems    @xcite , @xmath95 and @xmath96 systems have the    excitation energies of 264 and 325 mev for    @xmath97 and    @xmath98 , respectively , while it    gives 304 mev for the @xmath99    system . these excitation energies , which are defined with respect to    the @xmath100 lowest energy state , correspond to the    @xmath79 binding energies of 230 , 169 and 190 mev ,    respectively .",
    "nona - quark : :     very recently , a nona - quark interpretation of the strange tribaryons    is suggested @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "s@xmath2(3115 ) is    identified as a member of flavor 27-plet with    @xmath101 or    @xmath102 , and observed narrow width may be    explained by the small overlap of the wave functions of    s@xmath2 and hadronic final states .",
    "s@xmath8(3140 ) is then identified as the state with    @xmath103 or @xmath104 .        in conclusion ,",
    "we have observed two kinds of strange tribaryons in the @xmath0he(@xmath1 ) reactions .",
    "one species , s@xmath2(3115 ) , which was observed in the proton emission channel , has @xmath15 mev/@xmath5 and isospin 1 .",
    "the other species , s@xmath8(3140 ) indicated from the neutron emission channel , has @xmath105 mev/@xmath5 and its isospin is assigned to be 0 .",
    "several possible interpretations exist , but we can not discriminate them at the moment ."
