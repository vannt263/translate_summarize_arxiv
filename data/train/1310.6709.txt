    "elastic moduli are important for understanding various properties of amorphous metals .",
    "bulk moduli , shear moduli , and their ratio correlate to glass transition temperature  @xcite , glass forming ability  @xcite , brittleness  @xcite , grneisen parameters  @xcite , maximum resolved shear stress at yielding  @xcite , chemical bonding type  @xcite , and possibly fragility  @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the bulk and shear moduli is thus important for materials design .",
    "however , amorphous materials commonly contain at least 4 chemical species , making exhaustive experimental evaluation of candidate materials impossible .",
    "empirical methods for predicting stoichiometries with desired properties are therefore necessary .",
    "first principles computational methods prove fruitful , owing to their chemical specificity and absence of adjustable parameters , as well as the insight they yield into electronic structure .",
    "however , amorphous metals pose computational difficulties , as they lack both spatial periodicity and a unique structure . while the first problem can be practically overcome by imposing suitably large periodic boundary conditions , this requires hundreds of atoms per computational cell , straining computational resources , and requiring averaging over multiple samples to remove sample dependence .",
    "the second problem can be partially overcome by running molecular dynamics on a liquid sample then rapidly quenching the sample .",
    "however the requirement for equilibration further increases the computational time necessary .",
    "hence we adopt a different strategy .",
    "frank kasper phases  @xcite are complex but otherwise ordinary crystalline phases . due to their topological close packing",
    "they exhibit local icosahedral ordering similar to that found in many amorphous metals .",
    "[ fig : fk ] shows the standard voronoi polyhedra of frank - kasper structures .",
    "we expect that the similar local chemical environments of the frank kasper phases can be used to mimic amorphous metals , yielding `` amorphous approximants '' , similar in concept to `` quasicrystal approximants '' .",
    "these crystalline phases will be used to understand trends in the elastic properties of amorphous metals .",
    "it is observed that in amorphous metals , shear moduli are typically 20%-30% lower , and bulk moduli 5%-10% lower , compared to crystalline phases of similar composition  @xcite .",
    "many crystalline phases have small unit cells compared to system sizes required to reproduce amorphous structures .",
    "0.18    0.18    0.18    0.18    0.18    amorphous metals can exhibit high strength  @xcite , but often at the cost of a lack of ductility owing to the absence of dislocations . designing amorphous alloys for high ductility is impeded both by the challenge of formulating accurate amorphous structural models , and by the lack of a valid predictive theory of ductility even for the case of crystalline compounds , though there are empirical rules based on the poisson ratio , or equivalently the shear / bulk modulus ratio .",
    "we hypothesize that relatively ductile crystalline compounds will tend to create relatively ductile amorphous compounds .",
    "further , metallic glass composites , consisting of crystalline grains embedded in an amorphous matrix , have been shown to increase the toughness , impact resistance and plastic strain to failure  @xcite , further motivating the investigation into elastic properties of crystalline phases in metallic glass - forming alloy systems .",
    "the fundamental equation of linearized elasticity is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the stress tensor , @xmath2 is the strain tensor , and @xmath3 the stiffness tensor relating the two . here",
    "we employ voigt notation , converting the tensors @xmath1 and @xmath2 into vectors with 6 components @xmath4 . for crystals",
    "@xmath3 depends on the symmetry of the material in question  @xcite and contains at least three independent parameters . for the special case of isotropic materials",
    "@xmath3 has only two independent parameters , the bulk modulus @xmath5 and the shear modulus @xmath6 .",
    "the non - vanishing elements are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "an additional elastic quantity of interest is the poisson ratio @xmath10 , defined to be the negative of the ratio of axial strain to transverse strain . for crystals",
    "@xmath10 depends on the direction of applied stress , but in the isotropic case it reduces to @xmath11 notice that @xmath10 is a function of the shear to bulk modulus ratio @xmath12 , also known as the pugh ratio  @xcite .",
    "ductility and poisson s ratio are positively correlated in both polycrystalline  @xcite and amorphous  @xcite solids , with @xmath13 ( equivalently @xmath14 ) proposed as a empirical criterion for good ductility  @xcite .",
    "seeking simultaneously high strength and ductility , it is natural to choose chemical species which in elemental form have large @xmath5 .",
    "the species chosen must also be known good glass formers . early - late transition metal alloys fit both criteria , as the transition metals from group iv to xi all have @xmath15 gpa , and they are one of the",
    "most frequently examined classes of amorphous metals , .",
    "size mismatch criteria favor using transition metals from different rows and columns of the periodic table , e.g. ta and w for early transition metals ( etms ) , and co and ni as late transition metals ( ltms ) .",
    "co and w are of particular interest for materials design as co - based glasses exhibit ultrahigh fracture strength , w - based glasses have the highest known glass transition temperature for bulk metallic glasses , and both have high young s modulus  @xcite .",
    "ordinary crystalline materials contain randomly orientated microscopic grains and appear macroscopically isotropic . to compute the elastic properties for these `` polycrystals '' , orientational averaging is required .",
    "each grain is described microscopically by the same stiffness matrix , which contains between 3 ( cubic ) and 21 ( triclinic ) independent parameters  @xcite , but macroscopically the crystal is isotropic with only two independent parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the voigt average , the stiffness matrix @xmath3 is averaged over orientations  @xcite , which is exact if stress is uniform throughout space . in the reuss average",
    ", the compliance matrix @xmath16 is averaged over orientations , which is exact if strain is uniform throughout space .",
    "the voigt average systematically overestimates the isotropic moduli , while the reuss average systematically underestimates the moduli .",
    "empirically , the arithmetic mean of the two , known as the hill average  @xcite , gives improved agreement with experiment , and this is what we will report .",
    "the polycrystalline average assumes the stiffness matrices of various grains are identical to the perfect crystal , differing only by relative orientation . to obtain macroscopic elastic moduli in materials where chemical environment spatially varies , in particular in materials containing chemically distinct grains ,",
    "it is necessary to include effects arising from fluctuations in the local stiffness matrices .",
    "a general class of approximation schemes known as `` effective medium theories '' exists where each grain with its local stiffness matrix interacts with an effective medium characterized by a background stiffness matrix incorporating the interactions of all other grains .",
    "a popular effective medium theory is the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite , a self - consistent formalism in which the background stiffness matrix is taken as the macroscopic average itself .",
    "the self - consistent interaction of grains yields a pair of coupled non - linear equations , @xmath17 and @xmath18 which can be solved numerically for the effective @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath19 denotes the volume fraction of grain type @xmath20 in the material .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the bulk and shear modulus of grain type @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "although intended for mixtures of crystalline grains , we will apply cpa in the limit where each grain shrinks to a single atom , to estimate the elastic moduli of compounds using the self - consistent average of properties of the constituent pure elements .",
    "our usage of cpa may be viewed as a higher - order correction to the well - known but highly empirical `` rule of mixtures '' paradigm common in materials design , which has already been applied to bulk metallic glasses  @xcite .",
    "cpa takes into account the pure elemental properties but lacks information about interspecies bonding and specific alloy crystal structure .",
    "thus we take cpa as a convenient , physically motivated interpolation to establish a baseline for comparison with the computed alloy moduli revealing the specific contributions of structure and bonding , though we note that metallic glasses exist where trace changes in composition yield relatively large changes in k and g due to alteration of chemical bonding type  @xcite .",
    "our first principles calculations use the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite , a plane wave ab - initio package implementing paw pseudopotentials  @xcite in the pw91  @xcite generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "vasp calculates total energies , forces , elastic moduli , and electronic structure .",
    "all structures are relaxed until the maximum ionic force is below 0.01 ev /  , and the k - point density is subsequently increased until total energy per atom has converged to within 0.1 mev / atom . default plane wave energy cutoffs are used for total energy calculations . in structures containing co and ni ,",
    "spin polarization has been included .",
    "however , we do not include spin - orbit coupling despite the presence of 5d elements ta and w. total energies are converted to enthalpies of formation by subtracting from the tie - line joining the total energies of pure elements in their stable crystalline forms  @xcite .",
    "we perform elastic calculations using a finite difference method internal to vasp .",
    "to ensure proper convergence of elastic moduli , we increase the k - point density until the all polycrystalline averages converge to within 2% , then increase the energy cutoff until the polycrystalline averages converge .",
    "convergence in energy cutoff occurs at 360 ev , with the exception of ni@xmath23ta and ni@xmath24w where 400 ev and 440 ev respectively were required .",
    "all structures were tested for mechanical stability , and elastic constants were not calculated for structures that were found to be mechanically unstable , though they were included in the enthalpy of formation plots , as it is possible for the stabilizing distortions to affect the calculated total energy only weakly .    to quantify bond strength between individual atoms in structures , we calculate interatomic force constants and the crystal overlap hamilton population ( cohp ) . to calculate the force constant @xmath25 between atoms @xmath26 at position @xmath27 , separated by a bond in the direction @xmath28",
    ", we calculate the hessian matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we use density functional perturbation theory internal to vasp to calculate @xmath30 within a supercell of sufficient size that atoms lie at least 4.2     away from their own repeated images . restricting our attention to longitudinal ( bond stretching ) interactions and assuming central forces , we define @xmath31 as the projection of the hessian along @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath25 must be positive for the force to be stabilizing .",
    "the cohp provides an electronic structure - based characterization of interatomic bond strength  @xcite .",
    "one calculates matrix elements @xmath32 of the density functional theory hamiltonian between localized atomic orbitals @xmath33 and @xmath34 on a pair of atoms @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then multiplies by the density of states @xmath37 projected onto the two orbitals .",
    "we calculate wave functions using a tb - lmto method  @xcite then calculate an _ integrated _ cohp for a pair of atoms @xmath38 , summing over atomic orbitals and integrating over energies up to the fermi energy .      to check the validity of our first principles calculations we have prepared samples of single phase alloys of ni - ta by arc melting the pure element constituents ( ni 99.995% and ta 99.95% ) under an argon atmosphere .",
    "the alloys were then suction cast into water cooled copper molds to form rods of 2 mm diameter .",
    "single phases of the rod samples were verified by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) ( figure  [ fig : ni - ta_xrd ] ) .",
    "cylindrical samples were obtained by sectioning the rods with a diamond saw into 4 mm segments .",
    "the ends of the segments were polished to a 3 micron finish .",
    "the elastic constants of the cylinders were calculated using data obtained from a magnaflux quasar resonant ultrasound spectrometer .",
    "rus involves placing the cylindrical samples diagonally between two ultrasonic transceivers and recording the natural modes of vibration  @xcite .",
    "a levenberg - marquardt algorithm is then used to determine the elastic constants by finding the best fit solution through minimization of the difference between measured and calculated natural modes through iterative changes to the values of elastic constants .",
    "[ fig : ni - ta_xrd ]    the rus measurement technique is limited to nonmagnetic samples . the study using the rus measurements for comparison to theory is limited to the ni - ta system where single phases of ni@xmath39ta , ni@xmath40ta , ni@xmath41ta and nita , which are nonmagnetic , can be produced , allowing for rus measurements . rods of the pure elements ni and ta can also be cast , but of the two only ta produces nonmagnetic rods .",
    "in this section we first discuss atomistic structure , then present results on thermodynamic stability for each alloy system considered , finally we address the elastic moduli .      because we consider a large number of specific structures , we establish a numbering scheme to unambiguously identify them ( see table  [ tab : structs ] ) . in the text",
    "we refer to a given crystalline material using the notation compound.pearson ( e.g. co@xmath23ta.cf24 ) .",
    "of particular interest are the frank - kasper structures , which we take as amorphous approximants owing to the prevalence of their coordination polyhedra in many metallic glasses  @xcite .",
    "canonical frank - kasper polyhedra have coordination numbers cn=12 , 14 , 15 and 16 .",
    "however , we include the bernal holes  @xcite , notably cn=10 , as tetrahedral but non - canonical frank - kasper polyhedra  @xcite suitable for smaller atoms .",
    "also , the tetrahedral close - packing of the frank kasper phases matches the packing properties expected in bulk metallic glasses  @xcite .",
    ".[tab : structs]structure types considered listing common prototype , and strukturbericht and pearson notations .",
    "frank - kasper phases list common names .",
    "@xmath42 indicates symmetry - breaking distortion .",
    "`` non - fk '' indicates non - canonical frank - kasper phase containing cn=10 bernal hole .",
    "the final column contains a list of coordination numbers from voronoi polyhedra appearing in the structure  @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , < , < \" , ]     that mixing co and ni or nb and ta causes little deviation in shear modulus , but mixing ta and w does , is further evidence for the dependence of shear modulus on atomic environment .",
    "co and ni have similar atomic radii and electronegativity , as do nb and ta . for a topologically close packed structure like hr13 , substitution of these chemical species should not noticeably affect bond lengths and ionic charges , yielding similar calculated and averaged results . however , nb and ta have larger atomic radii and lower electronegativity than w , leading to larger charge transfers and changes in bond length , reducing the accuracy of our averaging scheme while generally increasing bonding strength .",
    "in this paper we examine the elasticity of various early transition metal - late transition metal crystalline binary alloys using first principles calculations and comparison with various averaging schemes .",
    "calculated bulk moduli were reasonably close to the coherent potential approximation using pure elemental species , but cpa predictions were systematically low .",
    "this deviation correlates strongly with volume per atom .",
    "larger and less regular deviations were observed for shear moduli , suggesting structural distortion being responsible for the deviation .",
    "select ternary and quaternary structures were examined and confirmed these trends . to explain the dependence of elastic moduli on chemical bonding , force constants and electronic densities of state were calculated and it was found early transition metals are responsible for the strongest bonding , which agrees with observed trends in the bulk moduli .",
    "we find that ni - w alloys have the largest poisson ratios among the compositions studied and hence hold promise as the basis for design of ductile metallic glasses .",
