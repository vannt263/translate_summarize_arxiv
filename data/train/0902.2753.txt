    "the idea of the present work is to study the influence of metallicity on the structure and distribution of magnetic flux concentrations in stellar atmospheres . for this purpose ,",
    "realistic local box simulations of near surface magneto - convection with prescribed magnetic flux have been carried out for the sun and a metal - poor solar analog , allowing a differential comparison of the thermal , dynamical , and magnetic properties of the photospheric layers .",
    "we compare two sets of simulations , both with @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3  k , and @xmath4@xmath2@xmath5 , but with different chemical composition ( [ m / h]=0 and [ m / h]=@xmath6 ) .",
    "all models are computed on the same 2d cartesian grid ( 400 @xmath7 165 cells , @xmath8@xmath2@xmath9  km , @xmath10  km @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 @xmath9  km , periodic side boundaries and open / transmitting boundaries at bottom / top ) . gray radiative transfer with realistic opacities for the respective chemical composition are used together with an appropriate equation of state that accounts for partial ionization of h and he . note that the main effect of the reduced metallicity is a general decrease of the opacity ; as a consequence , the gas pressure at the visible surface ( @xmath13@xmath2@xmath14 ) is about @xmath15 times higher in the metal - poor model .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the equipartition magnetic field strength @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the horizontally averaged kinetic energy density ) on the geometrical and optical depth scale , as computed from the two non - magnetic simulations .",
    "a homogeneous unipolar vertical magnetic field of four different strengths ( @xmath18@xmath2@xmath19 ( quiet ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( network ) gauss , respectively , was superimposed on the non - magnetic models , defining the initial conditions for a series of ideal simulations that are used to study near - surface magneto convection at different metallicity as a function of the prescribed mean magnetic flux . at top and bottom",
    ", the magnetic field is forced to be vertical ( @xmath23@xmath2@xmath24@xmath2@xmath25 ) ; at each height , the mean vertical magnetic flux thus retains its initial value @xmath26@xmath2@xmath18 throughout these _ ideal _",
    "( @xmath27@xmath2@xmath25 ) mhd simulations .",
    "an illustration of the resulting magnetic filed configurations is given in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "a first inspection of the simulation data suggests that , for given @xmath18 , the rms vertical field @xmath28 evaluated at fixed optical depth is very similar for the two metallicities , even though @xmath29 is significantly different ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "however , there is a tendency for stronger horizontal fields in the photosphere of the metal - poor simulations .",
    "these preliminary results need to be confirmed by more extensive 2d and 3d simulations with non - gray radiative transfer and alternative mhd boundary conditions . in the long run",
    ", further questions can be addressed by computing synthetic ( stokes ) spectra based on the mhd model atmospheres , e.g.  concerning the influence of small - scale surface magnetic fields on the micro - variability of the stellar radiation and/or on the accuracy of spectroscopic abundance determinations ."
