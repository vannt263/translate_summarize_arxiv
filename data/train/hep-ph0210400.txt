    "meson spectroscopy is an extremely broad subject , covering @xmath0 scattering with @xmath1  gev to the heaviest @xmath2 states with masses greater than 10  gev @xcite .",
    "the goal at both ends of the energy scale is to understand qcd in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "it is impossible to do justice to such a large body of work in a short talk so i restrict myself to a few selected topics .",
    "many other aspects of meson spectroscopy are covered in other contributions where the interested reader can obtain a more balanced view of recent developments . in a very short period of time , the subject of heavy quarkonium has come to the forefront . this is the result of two recent developments ; the cleo collaboration is taking data at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 which will exceed the world s existing data by a large factor and the b - factories have observed a number of charmonium states in b - decay @xcite culminating in the discovery of the @xmath5 in @xmath6 by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "these measurements have led to the hope that some of the missing charmonium states may also be observed in b decay .",
    "simultaneously , there has been great progress in lattice qcd @xcite so that we have progress on both the experimental and theoretical fronts . on a second front",
    "there continues to be vigorous discussion about the structure seen in @xmath0 s - wave scattering below 1  gev .",
    "my impression is that a consensus is emerging among workers in the field with respect to general features .",
    "however , there continues to be considerable debate about the details .",
    "low energy s - wave scattering is discussed in section 3 .    finally , one of the most important topics in meson spectroscopy is the issue of gluonic excitations . to highlight this topic",
    "i briefly describe a proposal that should make a definitive statement about the existence of these objects and map out their properties .",
    "the discovery of a d - wave @xmath2 state by the cleo collaboration @xcite and the discovery of the @xmath5 in b - decay by the belle collaboration @xcite represent important advances in heavy quarkonium physics . with continued running by cesr on the @xmath4 and @xmath3 , large samples of b",
    "- mesons being collected by the b - factories , and future measurements at cleo - c / cesr - c , i anticipate further discoveries in the near future . at the same time , advances in lattice qcd calculations of the heavy quarkonium spectra are leading to quantitative predictions which need to be tested against experiment @xcite . taken together",
    "we should expect a much better understanding of heavy quarkonium from first principles qcd .",
    "numerous @xmath2 states are expected to exist below the @xmath7 decay threshold .",
    "however , only spin triplet states have been observed in the @xmath2 system and only 2 spin - singlet states have been observed in @xmath8 .",
    "given that there is a wide variation of the spin dependent splittings predicted by various calculations , the observation of additional quarkonium states , including the missing spin - singlet states , would pose an important test of the calculations ( comparisons are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . similarly ,",
    "various calculations predict different values for the mass of @xmath2 d - wave cog ( the spin weighted mass of the triplet states ) .",
    "observation of these states would be a powerful discriminator of the various calculations .",
    "cesr / cleo has just completed a high statistics data taking run at the @xmath3 and will soon be running at the @xmath4 .",
    "we expect that analysis of the data will yield a rich spectroscopy . to give direction to searches we use the quark model to estimate radiative widths and branching ratios .",
    "there are several strategies to search for d - wave mesons @xcite .",
    "the first is via direct scans in @xmath9 collisions to produce the @xmath10 .",
    "however , given the small coupling of the @xmath11 to the photon and the effects of line smearing this approach would require substantial statistics .",
    "a second approach is via the electromagnetic cascades @xmath12 . using quark model estimates of both e1 dipole transitions and decays to final state hadrons @xcite we estimate the number of events for @xmath13 cascades that proceed via various intermediate states @xcite .",
    "these are given in table 1 .",
    "we expect @xmath14 events per @xmath15 @xmath3 s to be produced via @xmath16 states .",
    "backgrounds can be reduced using the @xmath17 final states as event tags .",
    "a substantial background will be @xmath13 cascades proceeding via the @xmath18 state which will also produce @xmath14 events per @xmath15 @xmath3 s .",
    "these events can be separated from the @xmath19 intermediate state using the fact that the energies of the intermediate photons are different .",
    "the cleo collaboration successfully employed this strategy for the first observation of a triplet @xmath20 state which was announced at this conference @xcite .",
    ".predicted numbers of @xmath21 events corresponding to @xmath22 or @xmath23 per @xmath24 decays . from ref .",
    "@xcite . where photon energies are quoted .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]      we consider two types of cascades to produce the @xmath25 @xmath8 and @xmath2 states @xcite .",
    "the first starts with an @xmath3 or @xmath26 produced in @xmath9 annihilation which then underdoes an m1 transition to the @xmath27 state followed by an e1 transition to the @xmath28 state and a final e1 transition to the @xmath29 state : @xmath30 @xmath31 the second cascade consists of the single pion emission transition from the initial @xmath32 state followed by an e1 transition to the @xmath29 : @xmath33 @xmath34 to determine if either of these cascades is promising we need the appropriate branching ratios and hence the partial widths . in the quark model they are given by : @xmath35 so that @xmath36 = 2.3 $ ]  kev .",
    "in addition we need the hadronic widths for the @xmath37 .",
    "there are considerable theoretical uncertainties which to a large extent can be reduced by relating ratios of theoretical expressions to observed hadronic widths . for the @xmath38",
    "we take @xmath39   = { { 27 \\pi}\\over { 5(\\pi^2 - 9)\\alpha_s } }   \\times \\gamma[^3s_1 \\to ggg]\\ ] ] where 1st order qcd corrections are included in our numerical results but are not explicitly shown .",
    "this gives @xmath40= 4.1 \\pm 0.7 $ ]  mev .",
    "combining the resulting branching ratios for @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] gives @xmath43=2.6\\times 10^{-7}$ ] .",
    "this would result in only 0.3 events per @xmath44 s . a similar exercise yields @xmath45=10^{-6}$ ] or 1 event per @xmath46 s .",
    "a more promising approach utilizes the hadronic decay @xmath47 which is estimated to have a br of around 0.1% @xcite .",
    "again we need to estimate the radiative and hadronic widths of the @xmath25 states : @xmath48   = \\frac{4}{9 } \\alpha \\ ; e_q^2 \\ ;   \\omega^3 \\ ; |\\langle ^1s_0 | r | ^1p_1 \\rangle |^2\\ ] ] giving @xmath49=37 $ ]  kev and @xmath50   = { { 5}\\over { 2n_f } } \\times \\gamma[^3p_1 \\to q\\bar{q}g]\\ ] ] giving @xmath51 = 50.8 $ ]  kev . combining the branching ratios in this decay chain yields @xmath52= 4 \\times 10^{-4}\\ ] ] which would yield 400 events per",
    "@xmath15 @xmath3 s .",
    "similarly one obtains @xmath53= 3.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\ ] ] in both cases it appears that the @xmath54 should be produced in sufficient numbers to be observed .",
    "there is also the possibility that charmonium states can be observed in @xmath55 decay .",
    "this was recently highlighted by the belle observation of the @xmath56 in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "belle had previously reported the observation of the @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xcite and the @xmath60 had been observed by both the babar and belle collaborations@xcite .",
    "it had long been proposed that the @xmath61 could be seen in @xmath55 decays @xcite and the recent belle result has led to a renewal of interest in this process @xcite .",
    "the subject of the s - waves below 1  gev garners some of the most vigorous discussion in hadron spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "thus , the discussion below reflects my impression of this subject which may not be held by all workers in this field . despite this note of caution",
    "i believe that there is a growing consensus on the general features of s - wave scattering in this kinematic region , if not on all specific details .",
    "the phenomenology of the @xmath62 sector reflects the many different components of the fock space : conventional @xmath63 mesons , @xmath64 states , glueballs , meson - meson molecules , and threshold effects .",
    "it is clearly a challenge to understand this sector .",
    "one starts by analyzing the raw data to produce phase shift plots and then one attempts to intrepret these results in terms of underlying models .",
    "much of the information on low energy s - wave @xmath0 scattering comes from measuring @xmath65 at cern @xcite and @xmath66 at bnl @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the experiments provide fewer observables than are needed to unambiguously describe the partial waves .",
    "one must therefore make assumptions in the pwa .",
    "in particular the role of nucleon spin is ignored and the role of the @xmath67 exchange amplitude is generally neglected assuming the dominance of pion exchange .",
    "these assumptions result in ambiguities in the extraction of phase shifts from the pwa .",
    "kaminski , lesniak , and rybicki studied this problem @xcite constraining the allowed solutions by imposing unitarity and using the non - observation of inelastic scattering below the @xmath68 .",
    "they further related the @xmath69 to the @xmath70 amplitudes to obtain @xmath0 phase shifts . including these ingredients they presented what they believe to be a unique physical solution .",
    "furthermore , by separating the pseudoscalar from the pseudovector exchange amplitudes they obtain the cross sections shown in fig .",
    "the conclusion is that the @xmath67 contributions are significantly different from zero .",
    "this is an important point which should be kept in mind in future experiments .",
    "high statistics enables the differentiation between different t - channel exchange particles which results in different couplings to final states .",
    "it is a very useful bit of information in understanding the properties of the produced excited mesons .",
    "given this information the next question is how to describe these phase shifts in terms of true resonances and from the dynamics between @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath0 .",
    "this was discussed in contributions by van beveren and rupp @xcite and by furman and lesniak @xcite .",
    "it is clear that one must look at the meson - meson scattering and extract the phase shifts not the resonance positions . to do this",
    "requires a multichannel approach which includes resonances ( from constituent @xmath63 channels ) and meson - meson interactions .",
    "an interesting and important consequence is that the pole parameters are dependent on the coupling strengths .    as a concrete example of this approach",
    "i show results for the coupled channel calculation of furman and lesniak @xcite .",
    "they constructed a coupled channel of two @xmath73 resonances decaying into the @xmath74 and @xmath71 mesons using the coupled channel lippman - schwinger equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are @xmath79 matrices with @xmath78 the matrix of propagators .",
    "the resulting argand diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "these plots show significantly different widths in the two channels which agrees with e852 and crystal barrel observations .",
    "the @xmath80 sector was also studied in this approach .",
    "what these multichannel approaches by van beveren and rupp @xcite and by furman and lesniak @xcite and by others show is that one can obtain a good description of the low s - wave spectrum in this approach .",
    "my impression is that workers in this field have come to a consensus on the general description of s - wave scattering although there continues to be considerable debate on the details and interpretation of what these results mean .",
    "the most important qualitative question in `` soft qcd '' is if and how glue manifests itself in the hadron spectrum .",
    "lattice qcd and hadron models predict glueballs , objects with no constituent quark content , and hybrids , hadrons with quark content and an explicit gluon degree of freedom .",
    "it is expected that the most definitive evidence for a non @xmath63 state is to discover a state with @xmath81 quantum numbers inconsistent with the quark model , so called exotics . because the lowest lying exotic glueballs are quite massive this directs the search to exotic hybrid mesons .",
    "the emerging picture of hybrid mesons is that of transverse excitations of the flux tube .",
    "for the light quarks this leads to the lowest mass hybrids of mass @xmath82  gev with doubly degenerate quantum numbers .",
    "in particular , states are predicted with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 which are inconsistent with the quark model and would therefore provide the smoking gun for new hadronic physics .",
    "there have been a number of sightings of such states @xcite .",
    "for example the brookhaven e852 experiment has seen evidence for the @xmath86 exotic in the reaction @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "here i briefly mention an ambitious proposal to search for and map out exotic gluonic excitations at the jefferson laboratory in virginia .",
    "the proposal takes advantage of the fact that exotic hybrid mesons have their quark spins aligned in an @xmath88 state . in standard hadroproduction",
    "the incoming beam consists of @xmath89 mesons whose quark spins are in an @xmath90 state . since exotic hybrids have quark spins in an @xmath88 state it is believed that hadroproduction of exotic hybrids is suppressed .",
    "in contrast , via vector meson dominance , a photon beam consists of quarks in an @xmath88 state so it is believed that exotic hybrids are more readily produced in diffractive photoproduction by `` plucking '' the gluon flux tube . to this end",
    "there is a proposal to upgrade cebaf to 12 gev and produce photons via coherent bremsstrahlung with a spectrum that peaks at 9  gev .",
    "this project would add considerably to our knowledge of hybrid mesons and our understanding of confinement .",
    "over the last while , there have been significant developments in heavy quarkonium physics .",
    "we expect this progress to continue with a high likelihood that the cesr collaboration should find evidence for the @xmath91 @xmath92 , @xmath54 @xmath2 states .",
    "it is also possible that they will find evidence for the @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 states . at the same time",
    "we expect that in the near future the various b - factories will discover some of the missing charmonium states in b - decay . beyond this",
    ", the cleo - c / cesr - c project would provide an additional avenue to study the charmonium system .",
    "taken together , this would represent the largest advances in heavy quarkonium spectroscopy in two decades .",
    "these results would provide an important benchmark against which to measure the results of lattice qcd and the various models in the literature .",
    "the situation with s - wave scattering at low energies is converging to a consensus on the overall details .",
    "good agreement between theory and experiment is achieved by describing low energy scattering in the framework of a multichannel quark model .",
    "nevertheless , there is still vigorous debate about the details and the interpretation .    finally , we mention hybrid meson production as an important tool in understanding qcd in the low @xmath96 regime and the nature of confinement . in the near future",
    "we look forward to results from , for example , the compass experiment at cern and photoproduction results at hera . in the longer term",
    "we expect that the gluex experiment at jefferson lab will provide a major leap forward in our understanding of gluon dynamics in the regime of soft qcd .    9 for a recent review see s. godfrey and j. napolitano , rev .",
