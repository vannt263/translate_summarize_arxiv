    "in recent years , there has been a considerable amount of interest in quantum violations of the weak energy condition and the inequalities which constrain such violations  @xcite .",
    "the fulling - davies model  @xcite of a moving mirror in two - dimensional spacetime provides a useful model for the study of such violations .",
    "in particular , when the mirror is moving with increasing acceleration to the right , a flux of negative energy is emitted to the right .",
    "similarly , when the acceleration to the right is decreasing , a positive energy flux is emitted in this direction .",
    "this model provides a simple illustration of how negative energy fluxes obey quantum inequalities , and of the phenomenon of quantum interest  @xcite .",
    "the fulling - davies model has been used by several authors to study the phenomenon of black hole evaporation , as there exists a specific trajectory which produces the same outgoing quantum state as does an evaporating black hole in two - dimensions .",
    "several authors  @xcite have used the mirror model to study correlations between particles emitted in opposite directions , which in the black hole case are the correlations between particles emitted to infinity and those absorbed by the black hole .    in this paper",
    ", our interest will be the correlations between the energy fluxes moving along different null lines , rather than correlations between particles .",
    "the positive and negative energy fluxes emitted by a moving mirror are really _ mean _ fluxes given by the expectation value of the quantum stress tensor . however , the quantum state is not an eigenstate of the stress tensor operator , so there should be fluctuations around this mean value .",
    "quantum stress tensor fluctuations and their role in gravity theory are still not well understood , but are an active area of investigation  @xcite . even in the minkowski vacuum state",
    ", there will be stress tensor fluctuations with subtle correlations .",
    "the expectation value of the stress tensor vanishes everywhere , yet an individual measurement in a finite region can return a negative value . somehow these fluctuations must be constrained so as not to produce dramatic observable effects .",
    "similarly , one expects that even in situations where the expectation value of the stress tensor violates the weak energy condition , there will be restrictions upon how much additional negative energy can be observed in a given fluctuation .",
    "however , this is not yet well understood .    in general",
    ", the study of the effects of quantum stress tensor fluctuations requires one to deal with the singular short distance behavior of the stress tensor correlation function .",
    "one approach is to discuss only spacetime averages .",
    "it is possible by a careful treatment to give a meaning to the formally divergent integrals of the correlation function .",
    "an alternative approach is to restrict our attention to the correlation between stress tensors in disjoint regions of spacetime , which will be adopted in the present paper .",
    "we will examine a particular mirror trajectory in detail .",
    "this is a mirror which is initially static , abruptly begins to accelerate , emitting a delta - function pulse of negative mean energy .",
    "the mirror subsequently stops accelerating , emitting a larger delta - function pulse of positive mean energy , and henceforth moves at constant velocity .",
    "the expectation value of the stress tensor operator is nonzero only along the outgoing null rays emanating from the points where the acceleration changes abruptly , and is zero elsewhere , including during the constant acceleration phase .",
    "our aim is to understand the correlations between fluctuations in the flux , including in regions where the mean flux vanishes .",
    "obadia and parentani  @xcite have previously examined the correlations between incoming and outgoing flux fluctuations for an eternally accelerating mirror , where the expectation value of the stress tensor vanishes everywhere .    one question of interest is the degree of correlation or anticorrelation of the negative and positive pulses .",
    "the time - integrated energy seen by any inertial observer must be non - negative in any individual measurement  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the integrated flux is described by an operator whose spectrum is bounded below by zero .",
    "thus not only must the integral of the expectation value of the flux be non - negative , but in each measurement the observer must detect at least as much positive as negative energy .",
    "now consider the situation where a fluctuation makes the negative pulse considerably more negative than its mean value .",
    "there must be a corresponding upward fluctuation in the flux somewhere else to guarantee a net positive integrated energy . although we partially answer this question in the present paper",
    ", our main focus will be to show that there are nontrivial changes in the correlations across pulses .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect  [ sec : general ] , we construct the various correlation functions for the right and left - moving fluxes in the presence of a mirror undergoing arbitrary motion . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pla ] , the explicit forms of the correlation functions are constructed for our specific mirror trajectory .",

    "this may come as a surprise in light of the discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] to the effect that the time integrated flux can never fluctuate below zero . however , there are two points worth noting .",
    "the first is that flux fluctuations in the vacuum must guarantee that the integrated flux in any measurement is not only non - negative , but in fact zero .",
    "thus the degree of correlation in the vacuum state , which suffices to guarantee a vanishing integrated energy in the vacuum state , also suffices to guarantee non - negative integrated energy flux for a moving mirror .",
    "the second point is that if the negative pulse fluctuates below its mean , the compensating positive fluctuation does not have to occur near the mean positive pulse , but could be elsewhere .",
    "one of the lessons of this study is that there is great deal more happening in the accelerating mirror geometry than is revealed by the expectation value of the stress tensor .",
    "there are subtle increases or reductions in correlations between the flux along rays where the expectation value vanishes .    in this paper",
    ", we have restricted our attention to the study of the correlations of distinct regions .",
    "more generally , one would like to study the correlation of measurements made in overlapping regions .",
    "this requires integration of the correlation function through the singularity at coincident points .",
    "integration by parts can be employed to define the otherwise divergent integrals  @xcite .",
    "this will be treated in the context of moving mirror spacetimes in a future work .        in this appendix",
