    "a remarkable progress in studying five - dimensional gravity is the discovery of a new object : the black ring.@xcite unlike the myers - perry black hole in five dimensions ( see ref .",
    "2 ) which has a spherical topology @xmath3 , the black ring has an event horizon of topology @xmath4 . during the past decade there has been growing interest in black ring physics motivated by looking for novel properties not shared by four - dimensional black holes . for example",
    ", it was shown in ref .",
    "1 that both the black hole and the black ring can carry the same conserved charges ( specifically , the mass and a single angular momentum ) , which implies the breakdown of conventional uniqueness theorems in five dimensions .",
    "many other interesting results can be found in refs . 6 and 7 . by examining these results",
    ", we get a deep insight into the nature of gravity .",
    "a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the construction of new exact black ring solutions in five dimensions .",
    "supplemented with the counterterm , the quasilocal formalism of brown and york@xcite becomes a very powerful tool to investigate the properties of these solutions .",
    "the conserved charges can be defined by using the divergence - free boundary stress - energy tensor .",
    "there also exist all ingredients necessary to study in detail the thermodynamics of various rings within this formalism.@xcite@xcite furthermore , an important application of the quasilocal formalism is to test the balance of a black ring .",
    "the balance condition results from the conservation of the boundary stress - energy tensor.@xcite@xmath5 @xcite    the aim of this work is to carry out a study on the dynamics of @xmath0-spinning black rings within the quasilocal formalism and to explore the mechanism for making these rings unbalanced .",
