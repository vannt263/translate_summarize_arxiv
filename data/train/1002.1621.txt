    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the revival of entanglement is not , strictly speaking , a non - markovian feature associated to an uncoupled two - qubit system .",
    "this shows that for the case of independent spontaneous emission decay , a similar behavior to that reported in @xcite can be found .",
    "our result , however , has been derived within a born - markov description , and as such , does not invoke a non - markovian treatment . on the same grounds ,",
    "this is different from the collapse - revival behavior reported for the interacting system of ref .",
    "the behavior showed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] changes with increasing emission rates ( cf .",
    "[ fig6 + ] ) : when the system decays more rapidly , the collapse - revival behavior disappears .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig6+](b ) clearly shows that , for a fixed rate , collapse - revivals are suppressed for higher values of laser intensity , for which esd becomes the relevant dynamical decay .",
    "mhz , @xmath142  mhz .",
    "the long dashed curve exhibits esd ; @xmath181  mhz , @xmath84 .",
    "the short dashed curve corresponds to @xmath182  mhz , and @xmath142  mhz .",
    "the initial state is @xmath183 .",
    "the remaining parameters used in the simulations are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . by switching to the initial state @xmath184",
    ", the inset shows the esd sensitivity to the initial condition ; @xmath185  mhz , @xmath142  mhz , and @xmath186 ; the other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig3].,width=260 ]    we have plotted , in fig . [ fig4 ] , the dynamics of the concurrence for the initial entangled state @xmath187 , to show the interplay between the laser driving and the shift experienced by the doubly excited state due to background noise fluctuations .",
    "the concurrence decays asymptotically when the laser coupling is absent , in agreement with our previous results .",
    "the main graph of fig . [ fig4 ] also shows sudden disentanglement ( but not revival ) when the laser coupling is strong and there is no contribution arising from the vacuum noise ( long dashed curve ) .",
    "this behavior is also observed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for a different initial condition , @xmath184 : the esd is more pronounced when @xmath95 tends to zero , and it vanishes for @xmath188 .",
    "this is because in our density matrix configuration , @xmath189 corresponds to the lowest system eigenstate in the standard basis , and hence , for @xmath190 , the system has a higher probability of decaying to the ground state and the interesting quantum effects are lost .",
    "the sensitivity of the esd dynamics to the initial conditions is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . in the main figure",
    ", the entanglement decays asymptotically ( uppermost curve , @xmath191 ) for the initial conditions @xmath192 ( for _ all _ @xmath95 ) , and hence esd never takes place .",
    "however , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that for the initial condition @xmath184 , and absence of laser driving , the entanglement decays abruptly for values of @xmath95 close to zero , and hence esd is reinforced at very early times @xmath145 .",
    "this clearly indicates that different types of initial entangled states experience different input noise from the environment .    an analytical expression for the concurrence , for the molecular input values of the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , follows from the calculation of the non trivial density matrix elements found for the solution of the master equation : @xmath193 the concurrence @xmath194 .",
    "thus , the esd time can be directly obtained from the condition @xmath195 ; for any @xmath196 , this reads @xmath197 for @xmath198 there exists no solution with physical meaning for @xmath199 , in agreement with what is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "an experimental study on the engineering and modification of the molecules decay rates has already been reported @xcite ; this could facilitate the observation of the effects reported in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we summarize the major findings of the present work on dimer entanglement dynamics .",
    "we have shown how the entanglement evolution , which includes esd , esb , and collapse - revival dynamics , can be precisely controlled by means of an external driving field , and an appropriate qubit initialization .",
    "in addition , the light - matter interaction can be used to produce transitions between the system states in such a way that a reliable production of steady state entanglement is favored .",
    "there are entanglement dynamics corrections due to the radiative shift of the doubly - excited molecular state arising from the vacuum fluctuations : in the scenario where the qubits do not experience collective coupling effects ( only independent interaction with the environment ) , the entanglement exhibits a collapse - revival behavior . on the other hand , by considering different type of initial conditions , an esd dynamics can also be induced due to the energy shift .",
    "we have shown that it is crucial , for a correct characterization of entanglement dynamics , to take into account the radiative corrections induced by the electromagnetic vacuum field , as such shifts or energy corrections permanently affect the evolution of entanglement .",
