    ", the same operators do not diagonalize the mass matrices and the higgs - fermion couplings , leading to the prediction of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) at tree level .",
    "for instance in the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , the yukawa interaction lagrangian ( for the neutral fields ) can be written as : @xmath9 which gives , after spontaneous electro - weak symmetry breaking , a mass matrix of the form : @xmath10 when this matrix @xmath7 is diagonalized , the coupling matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not , in general , diagonalized . to suppress tree level fcnc in the theory",
    "so as not to be in conflict with known experimental limits , an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry is invoked  @xcite whereby the fermions of a given electric charge could couple to no more than one higgs doublet . in the 2hdm , the up - type and the down - type quarks couple either to the same higgs doublet ( this is known as the 2hdm - i ) , or they could couple to different doublets ( 2hdm - ii ) .",
