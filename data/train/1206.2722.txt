    "recent emphasis on the distant and/or obscured target observation requires near infrared ( nir ) sensitive imaging devices .",
    "although the conventional ccd chips , especially the back illuminated , thinned ccd chips , are very sensitive over a wide wavelength range ( @xmath7 ) , most of them are not sensitive in nir bands , with the quantum efficiency ( qe ) of order of a few percent at @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "detectors made of low band - gap semiconductor materials such as hgcdte and insb offer high sensitivity in nir , but the nir arrays are expensive in cost , and have strict export restrictions , making them less accessible to many astronomical imaging applications . considering the recent high demand for nir imaging , it is thus important to develop a cost - effective imaging camera .    to facilitate imaging out to @xmath9 at a reasonable cost and within a fast development schedule",
    ", the center for the exploration of the origin of the universe ( ceou ) has developed a ccd camera system , camera for quasars in early universe ( cquean ) .",
    "it is a camera system designed primarily for the observation of high redshift quasar candidates .",
    "the design goal was to make a camera sensitive at @xmath1 ( qe @xmath10 20 % at @xmath11 ) with a moderate field of view ( at least a few arcmin across ) .",
    "the sensitivity in the red is governed by the need for the detection of the lyman break of objects at @xmath0 .",
    "the requirement for the field of view is to allow photometry based on the reference stars available from large area surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the large area survey of ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) @xcite .",
    "the optical performance requirement was to obtain the seeing limited point spread function ( psf ) with fwhm better than @xmath12 .    based on these requirements",
    ", we adopted a ccd camera with a deep depletion chip , a focal reducer , and an auto - guiding system .",
    "the development of cquean started in the summer of 2009 , and it was installed on the cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m otto struve telescope at the mcdonald observatory , texas , usa , on 2010 august 12 . since its commissioning run , cquean has been used for various scientific projects .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the overall characteristics of cquean , and its performance based on the first year of the scientific operation .",
    "section 2 describes the overview of the instruments including the science camera , its filters , and the parameters of cquean on the 2.1 m telescope . in section 3 , we describe various characteristics of the camera and images obtained with cquean .",
    "we report the performance of cquean in section 4 , and briefly describe the scientific result obtained with cquean in section 5 .",
    "finally , summary and conclusion are presented in section 6 .",
    "the main units of cquean are : a science camera , a filter wheel that houses seven filters , a focal reducer , and an auto - guide camera .",
    "the auto - guide camera is mounted on a rotating arm to secure a large off - axis field of view @xcite .",
    "[ structure ] shows the overall structure of cquean system .",
    "an enclosure holding the science camera system , the guide camera system as well as a motor to move the guide camera were made with several pieces of aluminum .",
    "the whole system is operated by a custom - made software package on a linux - running computer which is mounted next to the main units .",
    "the observers access the control computer over network during observations .",
    "we describe each unit in detail below .",
    "cquean uses an ikon - m m934 br - dd model from andor technology plc , as its main science camera .",
    "it uses an e2v @xmath13 pixel deep - depletion ccd as its detector .",
    "this ccd shows a higher red sensitivity than conventional back - illuminated thinned ccds , and also shows little fringe pattern as described later .",
    "in addition to the ccd chip , the camera contains a readout electronics , and the cooling unit inside the camera body .",
    "a fused silica window and a mechanical shutter are installed in front of the ccd chip .",
    "the camera is connected to the control computer via usb port , which makes it easy for us to handle but limits the cable length between the camera body and the computer .",
    "a thermoelectric cooler is used in the camera , which can cool down the chip to @xmath14c . however , after reviewing performance test from the chip manufacturer , we decided to operate the camera at @xmath15c because the higher operating temperature improves qe at longer wavelengths . even at this higher operating temperature ,",
    "the dark current is still comparable to the sky background .",
    "the pixel readout speed and preamp gain can be set to three different values , respectively .",
    "after several tests , we decided to operate the camera with the pixel readout speed of 1 mhz , and with the preamp gain of 1 . under these settings",
    ", it takes about one second to read the whole pixels .",
    "a summary of the technical specification of the camera is listed in table [ ccdspec ] . a generic curve of the qe of the chip at @xmath16c is shown in fig .",
    "[ throughput ] with a thick dashed line , which is taken from the manufacturer s brochure .",
    "the characteristics of deep depletion e2v chips suggests that the qe increase by 25 % at @xmath17 when the chip temperature is warmer by @xmath18c at the expense of a reduced sensitivity at the blue end according to the manufacturer . since the operating temperature for cquean was set to @xmath15c , the actual qe at long wavelength is higher by a factor of 1.2 than shown in the figure .      in front of the science camera",
    ", we installed a commercial filter wheel , cfw-1 - 8 , made by the finger lake instrumentation ( fli ) , usa .",
    "this wheel houses eight circular filters with a diameter of 28 mm and a thickness of 5 mm .",
    "we installed seven filters , and one black anodized aluminum plate for a calibration purpose .",
    "the seven filters are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , which were manufactured by asahi spectra co. , ltd .",
    "the @xmath26 , and @xmath21 filters are very similar to those for sdss @xcite , while our @xmath22 filter has a transmission curve identical to that of the lsst z - filter , which cuts off photons beyond @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath23-band filter is identical to lsst y - band filter whose bandwidth is narrower than that described in @xcite in order to minimize the contamination by telluric oh emission lines .",
    "the custom designed @xmath24 and @xmath25 filters have bandwidths of @xmath28  , and their passbands are located between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "they are designed to detect the quasar candidates at redshift of @xmath29 , since sdss @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 filter colors have difficulty in distinguishing these quasars from the galactic cool stars . fig .",
    "[ throughput ] shows the transmission curves of our filters as well as the qe of the ccd .",
    "it can be seen that cquean does have an excellent throughput even at @xmath23-band range , compared to other typical optical ccds .",
    "the 2.1 m telescope has a focal ratio of @xmath30 at its classical cassegrain focus .",
    "this large focal ratio would result in the field of view of @xmath31 for our science camera without a re - imaging optics , which is not adequate for our scientific purposes .",
    "the pixel scale of @xmath32/pix is also too small for the seeing condition at the mcdonald observatory which is @xmath33 in @xmath34-band .",
    "we made a custom focal reducer to enlarge the field of view as well as to correct optical aberrations , especially for coma .",
    "considering the seeing size , it is designed to reduce the effective focal length by three fold . in this configuration ,",
    "the corresponding pixel scale is @xmath35/pix , so that 3  4 pixels can cover the fwhm of a stellar profile under a typical seeing condition .",
    "the field of view of the system becomes @xmath4 .    in order to reduce the optical complexity",
    ", we did not seriously consider the chromatic aberration .",
    "the focal reducer consists of four lenses and is optimized for the wavelengths between 0.8 and @xmath36 .",
    "[ lens ] shows the side view of the reducer optics .",
    "the first three elements reduce the focal length while correcting coma aberration of the telescope .",
    "the last element corrects the residual astigmatism and field curvature .",

    "[ spot ] . all air to glass surfaces",
    "are coated to reduce the reflections for incident light of @xmath37 wavelength band @xcite .",
    "reflections for the light outside this wavelength band were not considered since the optical performance of the reducer was optimized for @xmath37 band only . therefore , the anti - reflection ( ar ) coating substantially reduces the throughput for wavelength bands shorter than @xmath21-band .",
    "the optical components in the focal reducer was manufactured by green optics co. , ltd .",
    "analysis of the test images obtained during the engineering run reveals that the focal reducer indeed works as expected : the images in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23-bands are perfect within the seeing limits , while those in @xmath19 and @xmath20-bands show coma aberrations on the peripheries of the fields . because we did not consider the fields at four diagonal corners of the field of view",
    ", some vignetting pattern arises at all corners .",
    "this vignetting can be reduced by flat - fielding to a certain degree , but four corners of the chip are not recommended for scientific use .",
    "section [ section_psf ] describes the characteristics of the image profile of the cquean optical system .",
    "detailed description on the fabrication of the focal reducer and its performance is given by @xcite .",
    "as described in @xcite , the 2.1 m telescope shows tracking errors which can be removed by feedback correction in every few seconds .",
    "we made an auto - guiding system for cquean and the telescope by installing an off - axis guide camera .",
    "proline 1001e model from the finger lakes instrumentation was used as a guide ccd camera .",
    "it has a @xmath38 pixel ccd chip with pixel size of @xmath39 .",
    "it is cooled to @xmath40c with thermoelectric cooling unit during the operation .",
    "an off - axis pick - up mirror is installed to feed an off - axis field of the 2.1 m telescope to the guide camera .",
    "there is no additional optics for the guide camera , except a baffle to block the stray light into the optical path between the mirror and the guide camera .",
    "direct imaging of an off - axis field results in the pixel scale of @xmath41/pixel , and the total field of view of @xmath42 .",
    "the expected number of guide stars brighter than limiting magnitude for one second exposure on the field of view is about one in the fields of galactic pole region , which may make auto - guiding impossible due to a lack of adequate guide stars",
    ". therefore we use a rotating arm for the whole guide camera system to increase the size of the viewable off - axis field by a factor of five .",
    "the arm assembly is moved with a stepping motor located behind the science camera ( see fig .  [ sysphoto ] ) .",
    "both the guide camera and the moving mechanism are controlled with the same computer .",
    "the observers need to control several components of cquean to obtain the imaging data .",
    "they also need a quick and efficient way to check the quality of the acquired data on the spot .",
    "therefore , we developed a gui program for cquean users which is easy to use , while providing functionalities sufficient to acquire the scientific data .",
    "the program is written in python version 2.6.5 for easy development and maintenance .",
    "the front - end gui is developed in - house with ` wxpython ` library , while the low - level instrument control libraries are supplied by vendors of the science camera and the filter wheel . to access c - based sdk libraries with python , ` ctypes ` package was used .",
    "in addition to those , ` numpy ` ( math library ) and ` matplotlib ` ( graphic library ) are required for the mathematical analysis routines used in the software , and ` pyserial ` for serial communication with the motor for the guide camera arm .",
    "the control program runs on a linux computer running centos 5.5 , and it requires x window system for displaying the gui components of the program .",
    "its gui consists of two windows : the cquean control window and the quick - look window . with the cquean control window",
    ", one can control all the cquean components to acquire the imaging data : the science camera , the filter wheel , and the guide camera moving mechanism .",
    "it displays the current status of these components .",
    "in addition , it interacts with telescope control system ( tcs ) of the telescope to obtain the current pointing information of the telescope .",

    "it has quick analysis features of displaying the contour / radial profile of a source selected with a click on the displayed image .",
    "[ gui ] shows the two windows of cquean control program .",
    "the imaging data are saved with 32 bit integer values to a fits format file @xcite after adding various header keywords to facilitate data reduction .",
    "the auto - guiding software , _ agdr _ , runs on the same linux pc that runs the cquean control program .",
    "it has been used for the auto - guiding of the 2.7 m telescope at the mcdonald observatory .",
    "a modified version for cquean was supplied by p.",
    "sam odoms of the mcdonald observatory .",
    "the _ agdr _ controls the guide camera to obtain images of a guide star with 1  5 second exposures , depending on the brightness of the guide stars .",
    "it determines the position of the guide star on a frame , and calculates offsets of the position with respect to the position of the guide star on a reference frame .",
    "then the _ agdr _ interacts with tcs of the 2.1 m telescope to correct the drift based on the offset obtained .",
    "the program repeats the procedures until the data acquisition with the science camera is completed .",
    "the auto - guiding performance was tested up to 1200 seconds of exposure .",
    "the test shows that auto - guiding with 1200 second exposure does not introduce any serious tracking errors @xcite .",
    "we expect that longer exposures are possible without much trouble , although we expect that most users use exposures not much longer than 1200 seconds .",
    "the _ agdr _ software is also useful for monitoring the seeing condition and the atmospheric transparency of the night , since it keeps updating the fwhm and instrumental magnitude of the guide star on a plot .",
    "cquean saw its first light during the engineering run carried out at the mcdonald observatory from 2010 august 10 to 17 .",
    "[ sysphoto ] shows cquean attached to the 2.1 m telescope . during the engineering run , we calibrated our guide camera system so that it can auto - guide the telescope correctly . bias and dark images of the science camera were taken under several different temperatures to check the temperature dependencies , though most of subsequent calibration and scientific observations were carried out with the temperature set to @xmath15c .",
    "various readout modes were tried to determine the best mode for scientific observation in consideration of both the time overhead and the readout noise level .",
    "several twilight flats and dome flats were obtained , and we also investigated science camera linearity range and calibration procedure .",
    "bias images were taken to examine the stability in the dc offset during the observing nights .",
    "they were obtained during the beginning and the end of each night , and also just before and after observations of each science target .",
    "the examination of bias images revealed that no particular patterns are seen in a single bias image , and pixel values are uniform all over the region with a standard deviation of @xmath43 adu which is basically the readout noise .",
    "however , the bias level shows a small amount of inter- and intra - night variability , which may originate from the temperature variation of the chip or from the electrical instability .",
    "[ biaschange ] shows the mean pixel value of single bias images during three nights in 2011 august run against the chip temperature .",
    "the bias level fluctuated during the run from about 4444 up to 4472 adus .",
    "although there are scatters among the samples , and differences among each night , the bias level turned out to increase as the chip temperature gets lower .",
    "the chip temperature is controlled by turning on and off the thermoelectric cooler , and the frequency of the operation depends on the ambient temperature .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the temperature - sensitive variations in the bias level is originating from the temperature - sensitive electronic components of the camera . fig .",
    "[ biaschange ] shows that the one degree change in temperature resulted in @xmath44 adu in the mean bias level , although the change is not entirely predictable .",
    "sort - term variation over one hour timespan is less than @xmath44 adu , so the interim solution for the bias level fluctuation would be to use bias images taken right before and after the observation of a target . in future , we hope to introduce an overscan area to correct for the bias level variation . for",
    "now , we suggest to take bias images before and after the observation of a target . since it takes only one second to read a bias image , this does not introduce much overhead .      to correct for the dark current signal ,",

    "[ exdark ] shows an example of bias subtracted dark images taken with cquean with 300 second exposure .",
    "the dark level is slightly higher in central columns than at the edges . but",
    "except for this feature , dark image shows a relatively uniform pixel value distribution over the image .",
    "the mean dark level was measured to be @xmath45 electrons / sec / pixel , with the ccd chip at @xmath15c .    during a night in the 2010 august run",
    ", we obtained dark images under various temperatures : @xmath46c , @xmath47c , @xmath48c , and @xmath15c .",
    "[ darktemp ] shows the result of our experiment .",
    "the dark level increases exponentially as a function of the operating temperature .",
    "the operating temperature is optimized so that the camera provides a good throughput at @xmath11 while keeping the dark current at a level significantly lower than the sky background .",
    "the sky count was found to be the lowest at @xmath49 adu / sec / pixel in @xmath19-band , and 3.8 adu / sec / pixel in @xmath23-band .",
    "[ sn ] shows the improvement in the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for a sky - limited observation of a faint point source ( @xmath50 ab mag ) with long exposures ( @xmath51 seconds ) .",
    "here we assume an aperture magnitude of a point source with the seeing of fwhm = @xmath12 and a circular aperture size of @xmath52 diameter .",
    "the background level is assumed for the bright night ( 6.2 dn / sec / pixel for @xmath23-band ) .",
    "once the object flux is much less than the sky noise , the result does not depend on the exact value of the object flux .",
    "the qe of the camera at @xmath53 is set to increase linearly with respect to its temperature as follows .",
    "the equation is derived by utilizing the data from the manufacturer about the increase in the relative qe values as a function of temperature for a typical deep depletion device :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 denotes the qe at @xmath16c which is measured to be 0.2 from the camera manufacturer s brochure .",
    "the dark current level is assumed to be as shown in fig .",
    "[ darktemp ] , and sky count of 6.8 dn / sec / pixel in @xmath23-band , respectively .",
    "observation efficiency improves by nearly 12 % and reaches its peak at around @xmath56c due to the increase in qe as a function of the temperature but degrades rapidly due to larger dark current level at higher temperatures .",
    "hence , we set the operating temperature of the camera to @xmath15c .      on each clear night",

    "we note that the vignetting pattern changes from run to run , depending on how the focal reducer was aligned to the camera at the start of each run .",
    "therefore , we recommend the users to use flat field images taken in the same run .",
    "note that the @xmath19 and @xmath20-band flat images show diagonal line patterns across the whole area . and",
    "the @xmath20-band flat images show stronger tendency of limb brightening than in all the other bands .",
    "these patterns in @xmath19 and @xmath20-band images may arise from the degraded ar coatings of the focal reducer lenses which are optimized for wavelength band of @xmath57 .",

    "the figure shows that the pixel sensitivity variation is of order of a few percent for the filters other than @xmath19 and @xmath20 , meaning that typical pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variation is very small . as for the @xmath19-band flat image",

    "similarly , the @xmath20-band flat shows a broader pixel value distribution since it shows a strong tendency of limb brightening than other band flats .",
    "we compared the flat field images on four different nights during a single observing run to see how much the flat field patterns vary from night to night .",

    "the coma is corrected for longer wavelength bands and it can not be seen for the @xmath22 and @xmath23-band images .",
    "this result indicates that while most region of the chip can be used for photometry of faint sources for wavelength bands longer than @xmath21-band , one should be cautious about using the outer part of the @xmath19 or @xmath20-band images ( radius @xmath77 pixels ) . on short exposure frames under excellent seeing",
    ", we recorded @xmath78 fwhm for point sources , demonstrating the good optical performance of the focal reducer .",
    "we estimated the sensitivity of the cquean science camera , from the data of bd+47 0478 @xcite , one of fundamental standard stars for sdss , obtained during the 2010 august run .",
    "the sensitivity of the system depends on the throughput of the optical components and the qe of the detector .",
    "table [ tbl4 ] lists the limiting magnitude during the bright time ( full moon illumination ) and the dark time , for one hour total integration with 5-@xmath6 error .",
    "the listed sky count rate is helpful when one wants to observe their targets in the sky - limited regime .",
    "since the dark current is only 0.3 adu / sec / pixel , the dominant source of the noise is either the sky background noise or the readout noise in case of faint targets .",
    "considering the readout noise of 8.2 adu and sky brightness in table [ tbl4 ] , observations with exposure time longer than @xmath79 seconds are limited by the sky background noise .",
    "the expected overall throughput of cquean can be calculated with data listed in table  [ tbl5 ] , and compared with actual measurement values in fig .",
    "[ measured_thruput ] .",
    "the expected value takes into account of the reflectivity of the two telescope mirrors , transmittance of the four lenses in focal reducer and the camera window , and the qe of the ccd chip .",
    "note that we could not include the wavelength dependent throughputs of the ar coating on the surfaces of the focal reducer lenses which had not been provided by the manufacturer .",
    "the actual overall throughput turned out to be @xmath80 % of what is expected in @xmath21-band to @xmath22-band .",
    "the throughput is especially lower at shorter wavelength bands : 25 % at @xmath19 , and 40 % at @xmath20-band .",
    "the reduced performance in these two bands is caused by the ar coating of focal reducer lenses optimized for longer wavelength bands .",
    "deep depletion ccd is known to be more susceptible to cosmic ray hits than the back illuminated thinned ccds .",
    "therefore we tried to estimate how much the cosmic ray hits can affect our science mission with cquean . to get",
    "a general idea of how severe the cosmic ray hits might be on a single image , we identified cosmic ray hits with ` l.a.cosmic ` @xcite , a cosmic ray removal program for a single frame image , on 73 frames of 300 second exposure taken with @xmath81 , or @xmath23-filter during a cquean run .",
    "we found that similar number of pixels are hit by the cosmic rays among all filter images : @xmath82 for @xmath19 , @xmath83 for @xmath22 , and @xmath84 pixels for @xmath23-band images .",
    "these values correspond to about 0.01 % of total area .",
    "the affected pixels are easily removed during the stacking of multiple frames or with other cosmic ray removal programs .",
    "therefore we concluded that cosmic ray hits do not affect our scientific mission of cquean .",
    "since 2010 august , cquean has been used to obtain photometric data for many scientific applications .",
    "scientific targets include quasar candidates at @xmath85 , transients such as gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , supernovae , and variable young stellar objects , and host galaxies of bright quasars . here , we summarize some of these observations briefly , in order to demonstrate the cquean scientific capabilities .",

    "about 1000 targets were observed with the custom @xmath24 and @xmath25-bands , among which about 20 were identified as promising candidates based on their colors from cquean and mid infrared ( mir ) colors of wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) @xcite data .",
