    "the main mechanism for higgs production in @xmath1 collisions at lep2 energies is the higgs - strahlung process @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is radiated from a virtual @xmath4 line . in the literature , this process has already been analyzed in sm @xcite , mssm @xcite and nmssm @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be convenient to discuss this collision process in other models , such as @xmath5 models , to confront the experimental results with all possible theoretical predictions .",
    "the @xmath5 models in which the sm gauge group is extended by an extra @xmath6 follow directly from susy - gut s or string compactifications . in addition this sound theoretical foundation , they have proven to be phenomenologically viable as well . for instance , like nmssm , the @xmath5 models can solve the mssm @xmath7 problem when susy is broken around the weak scale . however , they differ from mssm and nmssm in that they are further constrained the phenomenologically required smallness of the @xmath8 mixing angle . in @xcite ,",
    "a general string - inspired model was analyzed and phenomenologically viable portions of the parameter space have been identified . in this work we shall be working in one possible minimum constructed in @xcite , that is , we shall consider that portion of the parameter space where the higgs soft trilinear coupling is large compared to other soft masses in the higgs sector .",
    "in a recent work @xcite we have analyzed another important lep2 processs @xmath9 in the abelian extended supersymmetric standard model which was already introduced in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we found that it was essentially the second neutral higgs scalar @xmath10 contributing to the process in the limit of small @xmath8 mixing angle .",
    "now , using the model in @xcite , we shall analyze the higgs - strahlung type process @xmath0 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( k=1,2,3 ) be the cp - even higgs scalars of the model . as is well known from mssm @xcite higgs - strahlung and pair production processes are complementary to each other and we expect similar behaviour to occur in the present model as well .    in sec .",
    "2 we shall reproduce the formulae relevant to the aim of the work , at the tree level .",
    "in sec.3 we shall first analyze the cross section numerically , and discuss the results .",
    "next , we consider the contribution of the radiative corrections at the one - loop order , and show that they do not alter the tree - level results significantly .",
    "the coupling of cp - even higgs scalars @xmath12 ( k=1,2,3 ) to vector bosons @xmath13",
    "( i=1,2 ) can be expressed as @xmath14 where the couplings @xmath15 are model dependent @xcite . in giving the expressions for @xmath15 in the present model it is convenient to work with two dimensionless quantities , that is , higgs yukawa coupling @xmath16 , and normalized @xmath17 coupling constant @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath17 coupling constant and @xmath17 charge of the sm singlet , respectively .",
    "we shall first present the expressions for all the masses and couplings using the tree - level potential , deferring the discussion of effects of the radiative corrections to the next section . in the large trilinear coupling minimum @xcite ,",
    "cp - even higgs masses have , in the increasing order , the following expressions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath26 and @xmath27 coupling constants . moreover , neutral gauge bosons are almost diagonal with the masses @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath18 measures the @xmath5 mass in units of @xmath30 up to a factor of @xmath31 . using the elements of the diagonalizing matrix @xmath32 defined in @xcite , one",
    "can easily obtain the coupling constants @xmath33 in ( 1 ) as listed below : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath8 mixing angle , and is well below the phenomenological upper bound in the present minimum of the potential .",
    "the couplings @xmath33 listed in ( 4 ) are interesting enough to have a detailed discussion of them here .",
    "if @xmath36 ( which should be the case in phenomenologically acceptable @xmath5 models @xcite ) , one can safely neglect @xmath37 dependent terms all together . in this case the couplings @xmath15 get simplified and possess the following properties :    * @xmath38 and @xmath39 do have only @xmath40 type couplings , that is , they have diagonal couplings in @xmath41 space .",
    "* coupling costant of @xmath39 is always @xmath42 times the coupling constant of @xmath38 , which is an immediate consequence of the diagonalizing matrix @xmath32 given in @xcite . in this sense @xmath39",
    "is a replica of @xmath38 with a larger mass . *",
    "coupling of @xmath10 requires always a transition from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and vice versa , that is , it does have only off - diagonal couplings in @xmath41 space .",
    "@xmath43 , for example , yields @xmath44 after radiating @xmath10 ; however , it yields @xmath43 in the final state , after radiating @xmath45 . after discussing the coupling of higss scalars to fermions",
    ", the status of @xmath10 will be clearer .",
    "the vector coupling @xmath46 and axial coupling @xmath47 of higgs scalars to the fermion @xmath48 and vector boson @xmath13 are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the @xmath17 charges of lepton doublet @xmath53 and lepton singlet @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "we shall analyze the cross section for the @xmath55 scattering , assuming that it proceeds via the following chain @xmath56 the possibility that the vector bosons might come to mass - shell will be taken into account by including their total widths to their propagators .",
    "a straightforward calculation yields the following expression for the differential cross section @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the invariant dilepton mass normalized to @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the propagator of the vector boson @xmath13 and @xmath62 is its total width . in the cross section differential in",
    "( 12 ) , @xmath63 has the range @xmath64 as follows from the kinematics of the decay .    for each value of @xmath65 , using the coupling constants @xmath33 listed in ( 4 )",
    ", we can evaluate @xmath66 from ( 12 ) . in the limit of small mixing angle ,",
    "equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) yield the following vector and axial couplings : @xmath67 as is seen from ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , vector and axial couplings of @xmath5 boson depends on the unknown @xmath17 charges of the lepton superfields , as expected .",
    "the family independent @xmath5 models are severely contrained by the z - pole observables .",
    "however , if @xmath17 charges are family- dependent , then @xmath5 models are less constrained by the lep data .",
    "indeed , such family dependent extra @xmath6 s are realizable in string models @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can assume leptophobic @xmath5 @xcite and neglect these @xmath17 lepton charges .",
    "based on these reasonings , we shall assume vanishing axial and vector leptonic couplings for @xmath5 : @xmath68 which implies that @xmath66 in ( 12 ) gets no contribution from @xmath44 boson .",
    "thus , the production of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with the diagonal couplings mentioned before , proceed by the contribution of the @xmath43 boson only .",
    "the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 comes mainly from the dependence of their masses on @xmath16 and @xmath18 ( see equation ( 3 ) ) .",
    "as opposed to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath10 production is impossible as its production cross secton identically vanishes due to its vanishing couplings to vector bosons in the present minimum of the potential .    that only @xmath10 contributes to pair",
    "production process @xmath69 @xcite , and no contribution comes to higgs - strahlung @xmath70 from @xmath10 is a special case of the complementarity between the two processes , as already noted in mssm @xcite . in the scattering process under concern ,",
    "a non - zero @xmath10 signal would show up when the lepton superfields attain non - zero @xmath17 charges and mixing angle is large enough .",
    "however , when these two conditions are satisfied one expects non - negligable shifts in the z - pole observables in such a light @xmath5 model @xcite .    in analyzing @xmath0 scattering process",
    "we first integrate the differential cross section given in ( 12 ) over the entire range of @xmath63 to obtain the total cross section .",
    "next we depict the dependence of the total cross section @xmath71 for each higgs on @xmath16 and @xmath18 . in this way we can investigate the dependence of the cross section on @xmath7 parameter and @xmath5 mass . in the numerical analysis",
    "we take a lower bound of @xmath72 for @xmath73 which implies a lower bound of @xmath74 via ( 3 ) .",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "1 is the @xmath16 dependence of the @xmath38 production cross section , @xmath75 for @xmath76 , 136 , 161 , 172 , 183 , 205 @xmath77 from left to right .",
    "the first five points have been probed at lep2 and the last one is planned to be under search soon . in forming fig .",
    "1 we let @xmath16 vary from 0.345 ( corresponding to @xmath78 ) up to the kinematical threshold @xmath79 ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) . for each @xmath81 value",
    "the cross section vanishes at some value of @xmath16 at which the higgs production stops . as is seen from the figure , for @xmath82 the cross section remains around @xmath83 up to @xmath84 , so that @xmath73 values up to @xmath85 can be probed at this cm energy depending on the total integrated limunosity of the collider under concern .",
    "similar behaviour occurs for @xmath86 , 172 , and 183 @xmath77 for @xmath16 less than 0.4 , 0.45 and 0.55 , respectively .",
    "being much heavier than @xmath38 , production of @xmath39 is very hard at these cm energies . to demonstrate the behaviour of the cross section we plot @xmath87 as a function of @xmath88 for @xmath89 and various values of @xmath90 . using @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , it is easy to find the ranges of @xmath16 and @xmath18 : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "as is seen from the figure , the cross section is much smaller than @xmath75 , and vanishes for certain @xmath16 values as in fig .",
    "1 . for small @xmath16",
    "the largest cross section occurs for @xmath96 at @xmath97 . for higher values of @xmath18 ,",
    "cross section gets maximized at the higher end of the @xmath16 range .",
    "it is clear that with such a small cross section , it is necessary to have a large limunosity to obtain sufficient number of events differing hopefully from the predictions of the sm .    as is generally the case , unless one resorts to some sophisticated numerical techniques ( like the pyhtia and jetset packages )",
    ", the theoretical results obtained in this way can hardly be confronted with the experiment directly , because of the various cuts applied in event selection process to suppress the unwanted background .",
    "indeed , as one of the latest lep2 releases @xcite shows , the bjorken process under concern has a large sm background and higgs search in mssm and 2hdm for @xmath98 has a negative result . however , the results of the present work may serve as a guide for the design of near - future colliders like nlc .    in the above we",
    "have mainly focused on unpolarized electron- positron beams in which cross section differential @xmath99 involves only one angular variable : the angle between higgs particle and the electron beam .",
    "when the initial beams are trasversely polarized , however , @xmath99 picks up an explicit dependence on the higgs boson azimuthal angle .",
    "therefore , in this case , in addition to the cross section itself , one can work out the azimuthal asymmetry of the process , which provides further information on the appropriate portion of the parameter space of the model under concern .",
    "however , let us note that the total cross section for transversely polarized beams is the same as the one for unpolarized beams .",
    "if the electron - positron beams are logitudinally polarized , angular dependence of @xmath99 is the same as in the unpolarized case .",
    "however , the difference between the two beam polarizations enables one to define spin asymmetry of the process which can be important in constraining the parameter space of the model .",
    "unlike the case of the transverse polarization of the beams , here the total cross section differs from that of the unpolarized case .",
    "the sm- counterpart of the process under concern was analyzed by @xcite with a detailed discussion of the polarization effects and it seems unnecessary to have a detailed discussion of the polarization effects here because results of @xcite applies equally to the @xmath100 model under concern .    until now our analysis has been based entirely on the tree - level potential in the limit of large trilinear higgs coupling , which has already been shown to follow from string - inspired models in @xcite through the solution of rge s . however , it is known that the results obtained using the tree - level potential are very sensitive to the choice of the renormalization scale @xmath101 of the rge s , and hence one should take into account the effects of the loop corrections on the scalar potential to get more reliable results .",
    "this is what we will do next , up to one - loop order , in the frame work of the effective potential formalism@xcite .    in the framework of the effective potential formalism",
    ", the contribution of the radiative corrections to the scalar potential is given by @xmath102\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 means the usual supertrace , @xmath104 is the field dependent mass - squared matrix of the fields , and @xmath105 is a constant that depends on the renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the effective potential comes from the top quark and stops , due to relatively large value of the top yukawa coupling . in the limit of degenerate",
    "stops , the most significant one - loop corrections arise for higgs trilinear coupling @xmath106 , @xmath107 quartic coupling @xmath108 , and @xmath107 soft mass - sqared @xmath109 , namely @xmath110\\\\ \\hat{\\lambda}_{2}&=&\\lambda_{2}+\\beta_{h_{t}}s_{t\\tilde{t}}h_{t}^{2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the top - stop splitting function , and @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 being the soft mass - squareds of squark doublet @xmath116 and up - type @xmath26 squark singlet @xmath117 , respectively . as was already discussed in @xcite",
    ", one can realize the large higgs trilinear coupling minimum at low energies by integrating rge s with non - universal boundary conditions from the string scale down to the weak scale .",
    "the resulting parameter space satisfies @xmath118 that are much larger than the higgs soft mass - squareds . for this parameter set",
    ", it is easily seen that @xmath119 , proving the consistency of assuming degenerate stops .",
    "consequently @xmath120 , and it remains close to unity as the squark soft masses are around the weak scale .    in the light of these results , one can now discuss the stability of the large trilinear coupling minimum under the contributions of the radiative corrections in ( 16 ) .",
    "from the first equality in ( 16 ) one observes that @xmath106 increases in proportion with @xmath121 .",
    "similarly , from the second equation in ( 16 ) one infers that @xmath109 increases with @xmath122 .",
    "letting @xmath123 be the sum of the soft mass - squareds of the higgs fields , and @xmath124 be the sum of the quartic coefficients in the potential , one can show that the large trilinear coupling minimum occurs after @xmath106 exceeds the critical point @xmath125 this formula is valid when @xmath126 , which is easy to realize at low energies if non - universality is permitted at the string level @xcite .",
    "actually , such a condition is necessary for the need to an @xmath106 dominated minimum to arise , as otherwise one can create an appropriate low energy minimum by using merely the higgs soft mass - squareds . at the tree - level @xmath127 , and at the loop- level it increases by @xmath128 due to the contribution of @xmath108 in ( 16 ) .",
    "similarly , due to the contribution of @xmath129 in ( 16 ) , @xmath130 increases by @xmath131 . inserting these loop contributions to ( 17 ) , and using the tree - level relation @xmath132 required by the solution of the rge s , one gets the following expression for the radiatively corrected @xmath133 : @xmath134 therefore radiative corrections magnify the critical point that @xmath106 must exceed to develop a large trilinear coupling minimum . if the tree - level value of @xmath106 is close to the critical point , radiative corrections can destabilize the vacuum .",
    "for example , for @xmath135 one gets @xmath136 .",
    "while for @xmath137 , all vev s identically vanish , for @xmath138 all vev s are equal and get the value of @xmath139 . even if @xmath138 , when it is in the vicinity of @xmath133 , radiative corrections cause a transition from the broken phase to the symmetric phase , and completely restores the symmetry .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath106 , there occurs no problem in the implementation of the minimum of the potential under concern .",
    "thus , by choosing @xmath106 large enough one can analyze the physical processes with reliable accuracy using the tree - level potential .",
    "recently , in @xcite , electroweak breaking in e(6)- based @xmath5 models together with radiative corrections to scalar masses was discussed .",
    "here we consider a general string - inspired family - dependent @xmath5 model without exotics @xcite in which we do not restrict ourselves to e(6 ) charge assignments .",
    "one notes that the minimum value of @xmath16 , @xmath140 , which we have used in forming the graphs turns out to be the typical value for @xmath16 in such models .    in all extensions of the sm",
    "namely , 2hdm , mssm , nmssm , and @xmath100 models , @xmath141 and @xmath142 couplings are smaller than those of the sm due to the mixings in the higgs sector ( and also in the vector boson sector in @xmath100 models ) of the model , and this cause a reduction in the associated cross sections compared to those in the sm . for example , in mssm @xcite , lightest higgs production cross section is suppressed by the exitence of the factor @xmath143 , where @xmath35 is the cp - even higgs mixing angle .",
    "in addition to the mixing - induced reduction in the cross sections , one has a multitude of scalar particles which make it hard to differentiate between the underlying models .",
    "let us first summarize the situation in the @xmath100 models and then discuss the other models briefly .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite , the higgs pair production process allows only @xmath10 production in the limit of large higgs trilinear coupling . unlike this",
    ", however , the bjorken process discussed here forbids the @xmath10 production , which make two processes complemetary to each other .",
    "hence in the higgs- strahlung type processes , as the collider energy sweeps a certain range of values , one can get at most two cp- even scalars at the final state .    in mssm",
    ", there does not exist a minimum of the potential like the one discussed here .",
    "however , in the limit of large higgs bilinear mass term , @xmath144 ( decoupling limit ) , there is a single light scalar in the spectrum , all other scalars being much heavier . in this sense",
    ", mssm mimics the sm at low energies concerning their higgs sectors . in the opposite limit ,",
    "one has a relatively light higgs spectrum consisting of two cp - even and one cp- odd scalar , whose existence are to be probed at the colliders . in the absence of similarities between @xmath100 models and mssm in the large higgs trilinear coupling minimum of the former ,",
    "the only observable difference between the two models relies on the number of scalars they predict .    in nmssm ,",
    "higgs sector is larger than that of the mssm , due to the existence of the sm - singlet superfield @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , nmssm has three cp - even , and two cp - odd scalars which make it completely different than mssm and @xmath100 models ( due to one extra cp- odd scalar ) .",
    "however , in discussing the higgs - strahlung process ( where cp - odd higgs effects are absent ) nmssm and @xmath100 models are expected to behave in a similar manner as they have the same number of cp - even scalars .",
    "given the experimental signature of the higgs - strahlung process under concern over a certain energy range , is it possible to differentiate between nmssm and @xmath100 models ?",
    "in the limit of large higgs trilinear coupling , it is possible to have a parallel analysis of these two models from which one may conclude on the dissimilarities between the two .",
    "it is clear that to have a proper large higgs trilinear coupling minimum , in which all scalars have the vev s of similar magnitude , it is necessary to suppress the contribution of @xmath146 term @xcite to the soft supersymmetry breaking part of the scalar potential . with this restriction in mind and assuming a small but non - vanishing yukawa coupling , @xmath65 , for the @xmath146 term ( to forbid the creation of an axion ) in the superpotential , one finds the following @xmath141 couplings , @xmath147 corresponding to the first three couplings in ( 4 ) .",
    "the mass spectrum now is given by @xmath148 so that the lightest higgs has the same mass in both models .",
    "however , as dictated by ( 20 ) , in the nmssm only the lightest higgs contributes to the higgs- strahlung process under discussion .",
    "this forms a spectacular difference between the two models : while one expects two cp - even higgs particles at the final state in @xmath100 models , in nmssm there is just one higgs particle .",
    "despite the negative higgs search at lep2 , the bjorken process discussed here will continue to be one of the main higgs search tools in future colliders .",
    "therefore it seems necessary to have the predictions of various models in hand for comparison with the near - future collider data . in conclusion ,",
    "we have analyzed higgs production through the higgs - strahlung type processes in @xmath100 models in that minimum of the potential for which higgs trilinear coupling is large compared to the other soft mass parameters . at the same type of minimum , nmssm is found to have observable diffrences with the @xmath100 models ."
