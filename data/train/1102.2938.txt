    "massive ob stars , or groups of them ( young clusters or ob associations ) inject a large amount of mechanical energy via stellar winds and violent supernova ( sn ) episodes to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",

    "the high - velocity superbubbles are characterized by a shell expansion velocity @xmath2 , and they are as common as the low - velocity ones ( e.g. rosado 1986 ) .",
    "the difference , however , lies in the fact that it is virtually impossible to obtain expansion shell velocities in excess of @xmath3 in superbubbles with large diameters ( about 100  pc ) without additional acceleration ( e.g. an impact from a supernova remnant , snr ) .",
    "the energy injected by sn explosions would be an extra source of heating for the gas inside the superbubble and this could explain the observed x - ray excess .    in this work",

    "it is important to notice that the main effect of thermal conduction is to carry material from the external shell into the bubble , thus filling the bubble with x - rays , and maintaining its emission for a longer time ( see also silich et al .",
    "this is because thermal conduction drives a transfer of the material from the external shell to the center of the bubble .",
    "the standard model of bubbles ( weaver et al . 1977 ) predicts x - ray emission from the hot interior of bubbles by including thermal conduction effects .",
    "its success is controversial because in some cases the predicted x - ray luminosities where lower than detected ( as in the case of the n70 superbubble ) while , in other cases , the predicted x - ray emission is higher than detected ( as in the case of the m17 superbubble ; dunne et al . 2003 , reyes - iturbide et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the new results on thermal conduction effects mentioned above make us believe that thermal conduction is not the main ingredient originating the difference . in this work",
    "we propose that the inclusion of a supernova explosion , as an additional agent to be considered besides the stellar winds , is more important than thermal conduction .",
    "at least two reasons could be given in order to support this : ( 1 ) in the case of m17 , it is almost certain that no sn explosion has occurred yet while the age of lh114 , at the interior of n70 , makes plausible a sn explosion , and ( 2 ) the expansion velocities predicted by weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) model in the case of n70 are much lower than the measured velocities for this superbubble .",
    "as seen in figures 2 to 5 and table 3 only the models including a sn explosion predict a shell acceleration that could explain large expansion velocities as the ones measured in high - velocity shells , such as n70 . thus , we suggest that the main difference between high velocity and low velocity superbubbles is the occurrence ( or lack ) of a sn explosion in their interiors .",
    "off - centered explosions can change some of the detailed structure and dynamics , but the main conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "of course , we have explored only the n70 superbubble and we need to study in detail other superbubbles ( both of high and low - velocity types)in order to confirm this suggestion .",
    "we have studied the dynamics and x - ray emission of superbubbles driven by cluster winds including in our models supernova explosions alone , stellar winds alone , and a combination of stellar winds and sn explosions , these latter at different times and locations .",
    "we have turned our attention to the superbubble n70 in order to confront our model predictions with the observations .",
    "we computed four models ( m1-m4 ) of superbubbles using the properties of the more massive stars contained in the cluster inside the n70 superbubble , adopting the ism density and metallicity around this superbubble .",
    "the models are evolved in a homogeneous ( in density and temperature ) medium .    from our models we demonstrated that the case in which only the stellar winds inject mechanical energy ( m2 ) , the soft x - ray luminosity is lower by an order of magnitude than the observed value ( in agreement with the standard model ) . and",
    "the radial velocity of the shell is less than 45  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "however , the model of a single supernova explosion ( m1 ) , even when the input from stellar winds is not considered , could reach the x - ray luminosity and an expansion velocity consistent with the observations .",
    "nevertheless , a single sn explosion predicts the formation of a very thin shell which is not in agreement with the morphology of the n70 superbubble .",
    "three models considered the mechanical energy injected by stellar winds , m2 only considers the input from stellar winds , while m3 and m4 have been combined with a sn explosion .",
    "we included the sn explosion at two different positions , near to the cluster center , and @xmath412  pc from the cluster center ( m3 and m4 respectively ) .",
    "the sn has exploded after t=1.15@xmath810@xmath102  yr of the evolutionary time of the cluster wind . from models m3 and m4 we can obtain an x - ray emission in good agreement with the observational data during 20 and 75  kyr , respectively . and the shell velocity expansion ( @xmath4160  km  s@xmath10 ) , obtained in both models , could explain the kinematics measured for this bubble",
    ". models m3 and m4 formed a thick shell , also in agreement with the observations of n70 .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "both models m3 and m4 reproduce quite well the large measured expansion velocity of the n70 shell and the x - ray luminosity .",
    "model m4 lacks spherical symmetry because the off - centered sn , however , the morphological difference is somewhat subtle and it can be concealed for certain orientations with respect to the line of sight .",
    "so , we can not discard it .",
    "figure 10 shows the predicted h@xmath4 emission ( gray levels ) and the x - ray emission ( isocontours ) for the m4 model and figure  11 depicts the observed ones showing good agreement .",
    "it is important to notice that our models predict a large region inside the superbubble ( the innermost @xmath103 ) with temperatures @xmath104 , which would result in thermal hard x - ray emission ( above @xmath1 ) .",
    "however the density inside the superbubble is very low and it produces only a faint emission that is overwhelmed by the soft x - rays produced in the surrounding shell .",
    "we end by noting that in this paper we did not include the thermal conduction effects .",
    "however , for young superbubbles , with ages less than 10  myr ( as well as n70 ) the differences between models with and without thermal conduction are only on a factor of @xmath105 in @xmath106 ( silich et al .",
    ". a more important role of thermal conduction in superbubble models is the fact that it helps sustain the x - ray emission for longer periods of time .",
