    "current treatments of the thermodynamics of surface phenomena in solutions rely heavily on the original works by gibbs in 1878 , and one of the most familiar corollaries is the gibbs adsorption rule . in its simplest invocation , the gibbs rule states that in a binary liquid , the species having the lower surface tension will segregate preferentially at the surface .",
    "this apparent simplicity is deceptive : a survey of the literature reveals a hundred years debate over the application of the gibbs adsorption rule,@xcite not to mention its extension to multicomponent systems@xcite and crystalline surfaces,@xcite and its connection to atomistic models.@xcite    experimental investigations of the validity of the gibbs rule encompass measurements of adsorption isotherms,@xcite surface tension,@xcite and surface composition@xcite in a variety of systems .",
    "unfortunately , many of the liquids studied are too complicated for the simplest formulations of the gibbs rule .",
    "liquid metal alloys are in many ways ideal for such studies .",
    "miscible alloys exist which behave as ideal liquids , while in other systems strongly attractive or repulsive heteroatomic interactions can be studied .",
    "perhaps an even more important advantage of liquid metals is that the compositionally inhomogeneous region at the surface is known in some cases to be confined to an atomic layer .",
    "this is commonly assumed in calculations of gibbs adsorption that take a model of a physical surface as their starting point .",
    "for example , x - ray reflectivity , ion scattering , and auger electron spectroscopy measurements of liquid ga@xmath2in@xmath3 found a 94% in surface monolayer , as expected given this alloy s positive heat of mixing.@xcite subsequent layers have the bulk composition .",
    "similar studies of dilute liquid bi - ga ( @xmath4  at% bi ) likewise found surface segregation of a pure bi monolayer.@xcite even when the repulsive interactions between ga and bi cause more bi - rich alloys to undergo additional phase separation above 220@xmath5c , where a 65    thick inhomogeneous bi - rich region forms , the pure bi surface monolayer persists.@xcite in ga - bi , then , repulsive heteroatomic interactions substantially change the surface composition profile , but do not defeat the gibbs adsorption .",
    "the effect of attractive heteroatomic interactions remains an open question . in alloys such as bi - in ,",
    "attractive forces between the two species produce a number of compositionally ordered phases in the bulk solid .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that bi - in pairing may exist at the liquid surface , and compete with surface segregation .",
    "our recent temperature dependent x - ray reflectivity measurements of liquid bi - in alloys having 22 , 33 , and 50  at% bi revealed structural features not found in elemental metals or in the ga alloys discussed above.@xcite as we will show , those data were suggestive of bi - in pair formation along the surface - normal direction .",
    "however , since the technique did not measure the bi surface concentration directly , other interpretations of the data were also possible .",
    "a complete characterization of surface composition requires both elemental specificity and  - scale structural resolution along the surface - normal direction , which is difficult to achieve experimentally .",
    "auger electron spectroscopy , which satisfies the first of these requirements , is hampered by contributions from the bulk liquid.@xcite x - ray reflectivity by contrast is a surface - sensitive probe . in the kinematic",
    "limit@xcite the reflected intensity , measured as a function of momentum transfer @xmath6 normal to the surface , is proportional to the fresnel reflectivity @xmath7 of a homogeneous surface:@xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 represents an effective electron scattering amplitude that combines the electron density profile with the scattering form factor , and @xmath10 is the density of the bulk .",
    "the electron density variations that produce modulations in the reflectivity may result from changes in either the composition or the mass density .",
    "thus , inference of surface composition from the measured reflectivity is sometimes ambiguous .",
    "this disadvantage can be overcome with the application of resonant x - ray scattering .",
    "the effective electron density of a scattering atom depends on the scattering form factor @xmath11 .",
    "when the x - ray energy is tuned to an absorption edge of a scattering atom , the magnitude of @xmath12 becomes appreciable , producing changes in contrast between unlike atoms.@xcite with one exception,@xcite resonant x - ray scattering measurements reported in the past have been confined to studies of solids and bulk liquids , due to the difficulty of the experiment .",
    "the present report is the first to find compositional changes induced at a liquid surface .",

    "reflectivity measurements were performed at beamline x25 at the national synchrotron light source .",
    "the spectrometer has been described previously,@xcite except that here a double si(111 ) crystal monochromator was used to provide an energy resolution of 9  ev . for the present work ,",
    "we compare reflectivity measured at 12.5 kev to measurements made at the bi @xmath22 edge at 13.421 kev .",
    "the energy was calibrated by transmission through a bi foil , shown in figure  [ biin_fig:1](a ) . at the inflection point indicated by the arrow",

    "uncertainties in @xmath25 may arise from inaccuracies in the calculation , incorrect establishment of the incident energy , and the energy resolution . to account for these possibilities ,",
    "the analysis was performed for deviations in @xmath25 of about 20% ( i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 electrons ) .",
    "the results were incorporated into the error ranges tabulated below .",
    "reflectivity data at both energies are shown in figure  [ biin_fig:1](b ) ( symbols ) .",
    "these results were found to be both reproducible in energy and stable over time by measuring two 12  kev data sets , prior to and following the 13.4  kev measurements .",
    "the two 12  kev data sets are shown together as open circles in figure  [ biin_fig:1](b ) .",
    "the interference peak at @xmath28  @xmath29 is due to stratification of the atoms in planes parallel to the surface , a well established feature of liquid metals.@xcite for @xmath30  @xmath29 , the data exhibit a modulation indicative of a structural periodicity roughly twice that of the surface layering .",
    "this feature is consistent with bi - in dimers oriented along the surface normal , which could also give rise to alternating bi and in layers ( bilayers ) at the surface .",
    "we also find that the low-@xmath6 reflectivity is strongly decreased when measured at the bi @xmath22 edge .",
    "the reflectivity decrease itself varies smoothly with @xmath6 and does not exhibit a bilayer - type modulation , instead suggesting that the surface bi concentration is larger than that of the bulk .",
    "to investigate these possibilities , we calculate the reflectivity of a model density profile according to eq .",
    "[ biin_eq : refl ] , which is refined simultaneously against the data taken at both energies .",
    "resonant effects are included by combining the model structure and the scattering amplitude into an effective electron density profile @xmath31 .",
    "the energy dependence enters the analysis through the bi concentration defined in @xmath31 , and also through the fresnel reflectivity @xmath7 , which is a function of the energy dependent mass absorption coefficient @xmath32 and the effective bulk electron density @xmath33 that defines the critical angle @xmath34 .",

    "parameters used to calculate energy dependent x - ray reflectivity . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     this analysis demonstrates that to model the essential features of our data , there is no need to invoke long - range compositional ordering on a second length scale in the surface - normal direction , which we had suggested based on the previous non - resonant reflectivity measurements.@xcite still , we thought it important to investigate additional , specific models based on bi - in pairs oriented along the surface normal . to test for alternating bi - rich and in - rich layers , we attempted fits in which we forced the bi and in compositions to be substantially different from the results shown above .",
    "we also described bi - in pairing by allowing the positions , but not the densities , of the surface layers to vary .",
    "none of these profiles successfully described the data .",
    "our principal finding is the bi enrichment of 35  at% in the surface layer , compared to the bulk value of 22  at% .",
    "this is considerably less bi than would be expected in the absence of attractive bi - in interactions , which can be estimated from the surface free energy requirement:@xcite @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 is the excess interaction energy of bi - in pairs over the average of the bi - bi and in - in interaction energies ; for an ideal mixture , @xmath17 .",
