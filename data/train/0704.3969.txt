    "wireless relaying systems have lots of advantages over traditional direct transmission systems . for example , the periphery can be extended by the relays and the coverage of the existing network can be improved .",
    "using relays can also shorten the point to point transmission distance , which results in lower power  ( interference ) level or in higher throughput .",
    "furthermore , all these benefits can be realized in a more flexible , easier and cheaper to deploy network .",
    "recently , there has been a boosting interest in the cooperative diversity with which the spatial diversity is exploited through distributed relays . since the work of sendonaris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that introduced the notion of cooperative diversity , a number of relaying protocols have been proposed  ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the previous works consider the single - antenna two - hop relay channel where the source signal is able to arrive at the destination through at most two hops , _",
    "i.e. _ , the source - relay hop and relay - destination hop . in an @xmath0-relay channel",
    ", it is shown that a diversity order of @xmath1  ( respectively , @xmath0 ) can be achieved with  ( respectively , without ) the direct source - destination link .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the mimo multihop channel model without direct source - destination link .",
    "that is , the source signal arrives at the destination through @xmath0 independent relaying hops in series . in the two - hop case ,",
    "our model is reduced to the model studied by jing and hassibi  @xcite .",
    "the central concern of our work is to design relaying strategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity is maximized . in part",
    "i , we focus on the amplify - and - forward  ( af ) strategy with which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it . the main contributions of this paper are as follows .    1 .   first , we obtain the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff  ( dmt ) of the rayleigh product channel , whose channel matrix is a product of independent gaussian matrices .",
    "it turns out that each rayleigh product channel belongs to an equivalent class that is uniquely represented by the so - called _",
    "minimal form_. furthermore , based on the closed - form expression of the dmt , we derive a recursive dmt characterization that have very simple and intuitive interpretation .",
    "then , it is shown that the af multihop channel is actually equivalent to the rayleigh product channel .",
    "we can thus identify the two channels and all previously established results apply to the multihop channel .",
    "therefore , the diversity properties of the af multihop channel in terms of the number of hops and the number of antennas in each node are completely characterized .",
    "we also propose the project - and - forward  ( pf ) scheme , a variant of the af scheme , in the case where full antenna cooperation is possible .",
    "it is shown that , although the pf scheme has the same dmt as the af scheme , the pf can have significant power gain over the af scheme in some cases .",
    "finally , it is pointed out that using less relaying antennas improve the power gain by avoiding the _ hardening _ of relayed noise , a particular phenomenon in the af multihop channel . and",
    "reducing the number of transmit antennas can lower significantly the coding delay and decoding complexity .",
    "the vertical channel reduction result gives exactly the minimum number of antennas we need at each node to keep the same dmt .    in part",
    "ii of this paper , we will derive an upper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that the af scheme is not optimal in general .",
    "then , we will proposed both distributed and non - distributed schemes that achieve the upper bound .",

    "since the power of independent noises from different transmit antennas add up at the receiver side , the accumulated noise in the af case `` enjoys '' a larger `` transmit diversity order '' than in the pf case .",
    "we call it the _ noise hardening _ effect .",
    "some examples will be given in the section of numerical results .        from the input - output point of view",
    ", the multihop channel with af / pf protocol is merely a linear mimo fading channel , for which the dmt - achieving space - time codes exist .",

    "this result can easily be extended to a general linear fading channel and one can show that gaussian coding is dmt - achieving for any fading statistics if @xmath196 is large enough .",

    "these codes have minimum length  @xmath197 and are commonly known as the perfect codes  @xcite .",
    "they are dmt - achieving thanks to the so - called non - vanishing determinant  ( nvd ) property .",
    "it has been shown that they are approximately universal  @xcite since they are dmt - achieving for all fading statistics .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the rate-@xmath97 @xmath198 perfect codes . in this case , the only information that the source need to know is @xmath97 .      in the af case , provided the number of total available antennas @xmath44 , the vertical reduction result gives an exact number of necessary antennas at each node in the dmt sense .",
    "this result can be used to reduce the number of transmit and relay antennas . if perfect space - time codes are used , reducing the number of transmit antennas @xmath197",
    "means reducing the coding length , _",
    "i.e. _ , coding delay and decoding complexity , since the code length is equal to the number of transmit antennas .",
    "for instance , only two transmit antennas are needed in a @xmath199 channel .",
    "therefore , instead of using a @xmath200 perfect code the code length of which is @xmath201 , one can use the golden code  @xcite of length @xmath202 and still achieve the dmt .",
    "in fact , less relay antennas also means less relay signaling  ( relay probing , synchronization , etc . ) overhead especially when different antennas are from different relaying terminals  ( single - antenna relays ) .",
    "furthermore , using more relay antennas hardens the relayed noise .",
    "this is the same phenomenon as we stated in the pf case .",
    "therefore , the number of relay antennas at each node should be restricted to @xmath203 ( defined in ( [ eq : minimum_number ] ) ) , the number given by the vertical reduction .",

    "<S> in this two - part paper , we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels in which the source signal arrives at the destination through @xmath0 independent relaying hops in series . </S>",
    "<S> the main concern of this work is to design relaying strategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity is maximized . in part  </S>",
    "<S> i , we focus on the amplify - and - forward  ( af ) strategy with which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it . more specifically </S>",
    "<S> , we characterize the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff  ( dmt ) of the af scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and arbitrary number of hops . </S>",
    "<S> the dmt is in closed - form expression as a function of the number of antennas at each node . </S>",
    "<S> first , we provide some basic results on the dmt of the general rayleigh product channels . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these results have very simple and intuitive interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> then , the results are applied to the af multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the rayleigh product channel , in the dmt sense . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the project - and - forward  ( pf ) scheme , a variant of the af scheme , is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the pf scheme has the same dmt as the af scheme , while the pf can have significant power gain over the af scheme in some cases . </S>",
    "<S> in part ii , we will derive the upper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be achieved by partitioning the multihop channel into af subchannels .    </S>",
