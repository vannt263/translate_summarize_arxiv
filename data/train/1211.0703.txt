    "the experimental study of double - pion production off the nucleon has a fairly long history , with some of the earliest experiments going back to more than half a century . in the last two decades , with the availability of sophisticated experimental facilities at mami in mainz , graal in grenoble , elsa in bonn , and the clas detector at jlab , the emphasis of experiments with both real and virtual photons is clearly on using this reaction as a tool to study and extract the properties of excited hadronic states that form at intermediate stages of the reaction .",
    "theoretically , the study of double - pion photo- and electroproduction off the nucleon is a challenging problem because , unlike single - pion production , its correct description necessarily must combine baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom on an equal footing since the two final pions can come off a decaying intermediate meson state , and not just off intermediate baryons as a sequence of two single - pion productions .",
    "this requires accounting for all competing internal photo - subprocesses like , for example , the baryonic @xmath1 and the purely mesonic @xmath2 in a consistent manner .",
    "moreover , this means that for double - pion production the entire field of meson spectroscopy becomes an integral part of the problem , in addition to all baryon - spectroscopic issues well known from single - pion production .",
    "we follow here the general field - theoretical approach of haberzettl outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite for single - pion photoproduction off the nucleon , which is based on an lsz - type reduction scheme where the photon is coupled to the connected part of the underlying hadronic green s function by the gauge - derivative formalism  @xcite .",
    "the resulting generic topological structures for four - point currents like @xmath1 and @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msutc ] .",
    "the respective interaction currents subsume the full complexity of the final - state interactions of the outgoing two - hadron systems .",
    "practical ways to deal with this complexity are described in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the reformulation of the production current of ref .",
    "@xcite , this formalism was recently employed successfully for calculating single - pion production observables  @xcite .",
    "the starting points for describing the reaction @xmath4 are the elementary hadronic two - pion production processes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : basicprocess ] . for the present note , for lack of space",
    ", we will ignore here contributions arising from three- or more - pion vertices as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : basicprocess](c ) .",
    "their detailed treatment will be explained in a forthcoming publication  @xcite . employing the elementary interactions to all orders",
    "then produces the fully dressed hadronic diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all2pi ] .",
    "these diagrams represent the lowest orders of a three - body multiple scattering series that can be summed in closed form in terms of the faddeev - type ordering structure of the alt - grassberger - sandhas equations  @xcite , amended by nonlinear driving terms that account for the fact that at intermediate stages infinitely many mesons may be produced ( for full details , see  @xcite ) .",
    "applying now the gauge - derivative formalism  @xcite to the basic _ dressed _ hadronic processes of fig .",
    "[ fig : all2pi ] amounts to summing up attaching the photon to these diagrams in all possible ways .",
    "for the no - loop ( nl ) and one - loop ( nl@xmath5 ) diagrams , the resulting currents are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mnl ] and [ fig : loop1 ] , respectively .",
    "higher - loop orders are not shown for lack of space .",
    "we emphasize that all input current subamplitudes appearing in figs .",
    "[ fig : mnl ] and [ fig : loop1 ] maintain full _ local _ gauge invariance , as this is necessary for any reaction theory that aims to be microscopically consistent ; mere global gauge invariance is not sufficient in this respect .",
    "the respective four - divergences for each of the input current pieces , therefore , provide _ off - shell _ generalized ward - takahashi identities  @xcite .",
    "it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite how to do this even if some current pieces can not be calculated exactly ( which in practice invariably will be the case ) . utilizing these gauge - invariant pieces as input in figs .",
    "[ fig : mnl ] and [ fig : loop1 ] , one then shows easily that the resulting diagram groups are _ separately _ gauge invariant as a matter of course , with each group s four - divergence providing a generalized ward - takahashi identity of its own .",
    "following the field - theoretic approach of haberzettl  @xcite , the present note provides a diagrammatic expansion of the two - pion production current off the nucleon in terms of currents resulting from topologically distinct hadronic processes .",
    "each current group satisfies full _ local _ gauge invariance provided the input currents individually satisfy their respective generalized ward - takahashi identities  @xcite .",
    "the formalism thus provides a microscopically consistent description of the reaction dynamics of two - pion production off the nucleon .",
    "full details will be given in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",

    "<S> all electromagnetic currents are constructed to satisfy their respective ( generalized ) ward - takahashi identities and thus satisfy local gauge invariance as a matter of course . the faddeev - type ordering structure results in a natural expansion of the full two - pion photoproduction current @xmath0 in terms of multiple loops that preserve gauge invariance order by order in the number of loops , which in turn lends itself naturally to practical applications of increasing sophistication with increasing number of loops . </S>"
