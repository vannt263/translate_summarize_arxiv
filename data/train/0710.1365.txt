    "a thermodynamic system contains a huge number @xmath2 of interacting particles , with @xmath2 typically in the order of @xmath3 or larger .",
    "the microscopic configurations of such a system changes with time in a complicated and stochastic manner under the joint action of internal forces and perturbations from the environment . at the macroscopic level the collective properties of the system",
    "are , on the other hand , essentially time - invariant and can be described by only a few phenomenological parameters such as the mean energy density and the specific heat . nevertheless , at certain values of the temperature @xmath4 or other environmental control parameters , the macroscopic behavior of the system may also change abruptly and qualitatively .",
    "such phase - transition phenomena , being a major research branch of statistical mechanics for many years , are deeply connected with the break down of the ergodicity property of the system @xcite .    for a large class of complex systems with quenched disorder ( heterogeneity ) and frustrations in the interactions among particles as best represented by spin - glasses @xcite , when ergodicity breaks down , exponentially many thermodynamic states will form , each of which corresponds to one ergodic sub - space of the whole configurational space of the system @xcite . for these systems , it is widely believed ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that , the _ equilibrium _ properties of the system are determined by the _ ground _ thermodynamic states which have the global minimal free - energy density @xmath5 , and the distribution of equilibrium free - energies follows an exponential law .",
    "the _ excited _ thermodynamic states of free - energy densities @xmath6 are regarded as irrelevant as long as equilibrium properties are concerned , although they dominate the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of the system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a disordered @xmath7-spin interaction ising model ( @xmath8 ) @xcite is known to have an ergodic  non - ergodic transition at a temperature @xmath9 ( the so - called dynamic transition temperature ) , but it is expected that the equilibrium spin - glass phase transition will occur only at a lower temperature @xmath10 ( the static transition temperature ) . for @xmath11 , although there are exponentially many thermodynamic states , all the relevant configurations for the equilibrium properties are still assumed to reside in the same ergodic sub - space of the whole configuration space .    in this paper , however , we argue that these statements may not necessarily be correct . through a general theoretical analysis ,",
    "we show that the equilibrium free - energy densities of an ergodicity - broken system may actually follow a gaussian distribution with a mean value larger than @xmath5",

    "the theoretical analysis of this paper may help us to understand more deeply the equilibrium ( static ) properties of spin - glasses and other complex systems .",
    "when the equilibrium free - energies of an ergodicity - broken system follows a gaussian distribution , the ground thermodynamic states of the system may not be reached by any dynamical process , no matter how long one waits or which specific cooling schedule is used . in other words , equilibrium studies based on the gibbs measure will give a dynamics - independent lower - bound on the reachably free - energy density .",

    "when the system reaches equilibrium , its free energy is minimized , but its total internal energy still fluctuate with time . if many measurements are performed on the internal energy , one will realize that the measured energy values follows a gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the mean total energy and the specific heat of the system . both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are proportional to @xmath2 .    at low temperatures , however , ergodicity may no longer hold .",
    "as the environmental perturbations become weak , the system may be impossible to overcome the large free energy barriers between different regions of the configurational space @xmath15 ; it is then trapped in one of many ergodic sub - spaces @xmath21 of @xmath15 . in this ergodicity - broken case , a sub - space @xmath21",

    "we also stick to this gibbs measure .    to further understand this gibbs measure , in this paragraph we try to give an interpretation based on a gedanken dynamical process of heating and annealing ( but we emphasize that the results of this paper is independent of this interpretation ) . for the system to escape a thermodynamic state @xmath24",
