    "at the galactic center , the compact radio source sgr  a * appears to be the radiative manifestation of an accreting @xmath2 supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "its radio to mm spectrum is thought to be a composite of two principal components  a slightly inverted power - law with a notable bump at mm / sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "the latter is somewhat reminiscent of the `` big blue bump '' seen in many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , evidently produced by an accretion disk feeding the supermassive black hole ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but unlike the blackbody emission process that gives rise to the optical / uv thermal feature in an agn spectrum , the radiative mechanism responsible for sgr  a * s mm / sub - mm spectral excess appears instead to be a combination of thermal and non - thermal synchrotron emission within the inner portion ( @xmath3 ) of a hot , magnetized keplerian flow @xcite .",
    "( the schwarzschild radius , @xmath4 , for an object of this mass @xmath5 is @xmath6 , or roughly @xmath7  a.u . )",
    "the inferred characteristics of the compact region surrounding sgr  a * are also consistent with the @xmath8 linear polarization detected from this source at mm wavelengths @xcite . given the complex spatial arrangement of the mass - losing stars that feed this object , it is unlikely that the disk angular momentum axis is aligned with the spin axis of the black hole .    the possible ( but currently unconfirmed ) detection of a 106-day cycle in sgr  a * s radio variability @xcite has added significant intrigue to this picture , since it may indicate precession of the disk induced by the spin of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the dynamical time scale near the marginally stable orbit around an object with this mass is @xmath9 minutes .",
    "thus , since the physical conditions associated with the disk around sgr  a * imply unwarped , coherent precession , a precession period of 106 days may be indicative of a small black - hole spin ( @xmath10 ) if the circularized flow is confined to a region within @xmath11 .",
    "( throughout this paper , we define @xmath12 to be the black hole angular momentum divided by @xmath13 . )",
    "the precession of a larger structure at the same rate would require a bigger black hole spin ; alternatively , for a given black hole spin , a larger disk would precess with a longer period .",
    "@xcite also noted that a small value of @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) would be favored if the non - thermal ( @xmath15 cm ) portion of sgr a * s spectrum is powered with energy extracted via a blandford - znajek type of process , for which the observed luminosity would correspond to an outer disk radius @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , a small disk size was suggested by earlier hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations @xcite , and is implied by sgr a * s spectral and polarimetric characteristics .    for a thin , cold disk ,",
    "the differential lense - thirring precession dominates the internal coupling of the plasma at small radii and therefore leads to the so - called bardeen - petterson effect @xcite , in which the inner region flattens toward the equatorial plane , producing a warped accretion pattern . as shown by @xcite and confirmed recently by @xcite , however , thicker disks with a mid - plane mach number of @xmath17 or less can suppress warping effects due to the coupling provided by pressure gradients and viscosity in the gas .",
    "the mid - plane mach number in sgr  a * is @xmath18 ( for detailed comparisons of model disks to observations , see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it seems that the disk in this system may be precessing as one unwarped structure @xcite . in this paper , we report the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations we have carried out to test these ideas at a higher level of sophistication than was attempted earlier by @xcite .",
    "we evolve gaseous disks in the gravitational potential of the black hole at the galactic center using the three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code described in @xcite .",
    "the inner boundary of the calculation is placed at a radius corresponding to the innermost stable circular orbit , as a function of @xmath12 . for simplicity in this first generation of calculations ,",
    "particles crossing the inner boundary carry all of their mass and angular momentum into the black hole , and no additional infalling material enters the simulation at the outer edge of the disk ; we also do not model the magnetic field or evolve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics , but we include a prescription for the role of the magnetorotational instability in transporting angular momentum ( see below ) . in principle , infalling material can exert an additional torque on the disk with a tendency to align the disk s angular momentum vector with that of the accreting plasma . however , the angular momentum flow through the disk is also subject to magnetic coupling effects at its inner boundary @xcite , which can either offset or enhance the effect of the external torque , depending on the configuration of the magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we do not fully explore the range of inner and outer boundary conditions in this first treatment and instead leave this important survey to future publications .",
    "consequently , our simulated disks mediate an outward viscous transport of angular momentum , which causes them to slowly grow in radius .",
    "we construct disks based on current estimates of flow properties in the galactic center @xcite , and we incorporate important effects of general relativity in a kerr metric and an anomalous viscosity due to the magnetorotational instability that the observations strongly indicate is active in this system . the gravomagnetic force per unit mass and",
    "the anomalous viscosity dominate the dynamics of the disk ; even at its turbulent saturation point , the magnetic field energy represents only about @xmath19 percent of the equipartition value . since the adoption of a post - newtonian approach to handle the general relativistic effects ( see below ) introduces @xmath20 percent errors , it is reasonable to ignore the dynamical impact of the magnetic field for the first set of simulations . advancing this study to the next level of sophistication",
    "will entail the use of a more elaborate magnetohydrodynamic treatment , which is currently in development .",
    "in the final analysis , we will indeed follow the evolution of the inner disk in sgr a * with all effects included in the simulation : the magnetic field and associated anomalous viscosity and the gravomagnetic force per unit mass .",
    "the calculations we describe here will provide a powerful baseline against which the later calculations may be compared and tested .      since the gravitational influence of interest simulated here occurs many schwarzschild radii from the black hole , we follow @xcite and include the relativistic effects only in a post - newtonian approximation .",
    "our momentum equation therefore takes the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density , @xmath23 is the velocity , @xmath24 is the pressure , @xmath25 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath26 is the viscous force per unit mass .",
    "the term @xmath27 is the lowest - order post - newtonian approximation to the gravomagnetic force per unit mass near a rotating black hole ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this equation , @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 in terms of the ( cylindrical ) coordinate vector @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the spin angular momentum of a kerr black hole ( using our definition of @xmath12 ; see above ) is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the unit vector in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "we calculate the gravitational acceleration due to the black hole using @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 ) , which produces the correct apsidal precession frequency at large distances from the black hole @xcite .",
    "we use an equation of state of the form @xmath38where @xmath24 is the pressure , @xmath39 is the heat capacity ratio , and @xmath40 is a constant chosen to set the midplane mach number .",
    "energy dissipated through artificial viscosity is allowed to leave the system .",
    "many of the properties derived by @xcite for weakly magnetized accretion disks appear to be present in sgr  a*. one of the most important defining characteristics is the existence of an anomalous viscosity arising from the maxwell stress , which in sgr  a * easily dominates over the reynolds stress . in our calculations , we model the effect of this anomalous viscosity using the @xmath41-disk prescription @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the local sound speed and @xmath44 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "earlier quasi - analytical fits to sgr  a * s spectrum , and analysis of x - ray flares detected from this object by _",
    "@xcite concluded that the ratio @xmath45 of maxwell stress to thermal pressure is @xmath46 ; since the viscosity @xmath47 can also be written as @xmath48 we relate @xmath41 and @xmath45 using @xmath49 and find that @xmath41 should be approximately 0.03 in our model disks .",
    "we implement the viscosity using the same technique used by @xcite , i.e. , we adjust the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath50 and the von neumann - richtmyer viscosity coefficient @xmath51 of the standard sph artificial viscosity prescription . following @xcite , we set @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by tracking the motion of particles in our calculations , measuring the ratio of orbital period @xmath24 to accretion timescale @xmath54 , and relating the ratio of timescales to the viscosity parameter @xmath55 , we find that a value of @xmath52 corresponds to a value of @xmath56 .",
    "the characteristics of the three simulations we ran that directly address the questions we wish to answer in this paper are summarized in table  [ sims ] .",
    "simulation e1 is a direct comparison with the calculation of the same name reported by @xcite .",
    "simulation gc20 was constructed with an initial outer radius of @xmath57 ; the parameters of this model were chosen to be fully consistent with the physical conditions outlined above .",
    "it is the contrast between this model and e1 that we expect to highlight the difference between the behavior of a cold disk that is subject to the bardeen - petterson effect and the low - mach - number disk that we believe is present at the galactic center ; according to earlier semi - analytical analysis , the galactic center disk ought not to experience this effect .",
    "however , because we have chosen not to feed the disk from outside , the viscous transport of angular momentum leads to a slow growth in its size ; to test the dependence of the disk s temporal behavior on the initial conditions , we also carried out simulation gc30 , which has an initial size of @xmath58 and is otherwise identical to gc20 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d - np ] shows the 3-d arrangement of sph particles in our reproduction of test e1 by @xcite . in this image ,",
    "the black hole spin axis points in the vertical direction .",
    "the outer portion of the disk has maintained its original 10-degree inclination relative to this direction .",
    "however , due to the bardeen - petterson effect , the inner portion of the disk has become warped and now lies in the equatorial plane of the black hole . by this time in the simulation , which corresponds to 4 keplerian orbital periods at @xmath59 , the transition region between the outer inclined portion of the disk and",
    "the inner warped portion has stabilized at a radius of @xmath60 , in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a disk constructed according to the best estimates for conditions in the galactic center does not warp ; instead , the entire disk remains tilted out of the equatorial plane and precesses around the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d - gc ] shows the 3-d arrangement of sph particles in simulation gc30 after 85 keplerian orbits at @xmath58 , when the disk has an outer radius of @xmath61 ; the central portion of the disk lies in the same plane as the rest of the disk , and not in the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "@xcite also considered one case in which the midplane mach number was low ( specifically , @xmath62 ) and found that that particular disk did not warp .",
    "our result for model gc30 , which has a midplane mach number of @xmath63 , is consistent with their finding .",
    "simulation gc20 behaves in exactly the same way .",
    "a principal result of this work is that the physical conditions inferred from sgr  a * s spectrum evidently imply that the entire disk precesses coherently around the black hole spin axis , confirming the prediction of @xcite .",
    "an important observational signature of this effect is the dependence of the precession period on the size of the disk for a given value of the black hole spin parameter .",
    "the size of the disk provides a measure of the moment of inertia of the structure , whose response to the applied gravomagnetic torque determines the rate of precession .",
    "@xcite argued that the precession period of a coherently - precessing simplified model disk should vary as @xmath64 , under the assumption that the surface density in the disk is constant . to test this predicted dependence , we evolved the disk over many orbital periods , tracing its growth in size and corresponding change in precession period ; the relationship is summarized in figure  [ fig : pvsr ] .",
    "note that the disk radius plotted along the horizontal axis is actually the radius of the thickest portion of the disk , not the radius of the outermost particle in the simulation .",
    "the low number density of particles at the outer disk edge inhibits a consistent and accurate determination of what actually constitutes the disk size ; choosing the radius where the disk is thickest , on the other hand , provides a more stable and reliable determination of the disk size .",
    "starting with an outer radius of @xmath57 , and assuming that @xmath65 ( see table 1 ) , the precession period is 69  days .",
    "the period grows smoothly and monotonically as the disk expands under the action of viscous angular momentum transport and reaches approximately 600  days when the outer radius is @xmath66 . in this figure",
    ", the solid curve indicates the calculated behavior of the period as a function of outer disk radius ; the dashed curve gives a strict @xmath67 dependence .",
    "our simulations clearly exhibit a period that varies as @xmath64 ; this is a consequence of the fact that our gc20 and gc30 disks precess as coherent structures .",
    "future work will including the effect of infalling material and a more thorough survey of the dependence of disk evolution on black hole parameters such as @xmath12 . very importantly , we will study another potentially significant signature : the prograde - retrograde flip that might occur due to sudden changes in the accreted angular momentum @xmath68 .",
    "past hydrodynamic simulations @xcite have hinted that the complex , clumpy structure of the infalling plasma can lead to significant fluctuations in both the magnitude and direction of @xmath68 .",
    "we find that the physical conditions associated with accretion onto sgr  a * imply the presence of a compact accretion disk that precesses as a coherent , unwarped structure about the black hole spin axis .",
    "our simulations confirm the general results of @xcite ; specifically , we find that the low - mach - number disk in sgr  a * would not be subject to the bardeen - petterson effect . given the observed constraints on disk parameters , we provide an accurate determination of the precession period of such a disk .",
    "the fact that this period varies as @xmath64 may eventually lead to a compelling determination of the black hole spin ; alternatively , if other independent techniques or observations can provide accurate estimates of the spin , our results determine the radius of the disk around sgr  a*.    observationally , our work provides some motivation for expecting a modulation in sgr a * s flux with a period of @xmath0  days ; we have found that the precession period is in this range as long as the disk size is @xmath69 . such a modulation might arise in portions of sgr  a * s spectrum produced by an occulted emitter ; for example , it is known that sgr  a * s radio emission is produced on scales of @xmath70 ( see , e.g. , bower et al .",
    "thus , since this disk is optically thick to cm radiation @xcite , its precession may lead to a variable aspect that periodically attenuates the total radio flux from this region .",
    "this effect may already have been observed ; @xcite report a detection of a @xmath1-day cycle in sgr  a * s radio emission .",
    "if this result is eventually confirmed , and if indeed it appears that only a disk precessing in a non - isotropic gravitational field can account for it , we may eventually be able to use it as a probe of the spacetime within the inner @xmath71 of a kerr metric and , more importantly , as a means of directly measuring the black hole s spin .",
    "on the other hand , a non - confirmation of such a modulation on a @xmath72-day timescale would tell us that either no disk is present in sgr  a * or that its properties  specifically , its size and orientation  are different from what we now understand , or that the geometry of the emission region has not yet been identified .",
    "the fact that such a determination can be made points to the predictive power of detailed numerical simulations like those reported here and argues for the need for more sophisticated calculations incorporating the effects we have ignored thus far .",
