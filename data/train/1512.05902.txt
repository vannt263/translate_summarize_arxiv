    "one of the most intriguing phenomena in low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) are the extreme accretion outbursts characterized by a sudden brightening in the optical by 1 to 6 magnitudes ( herbig 1977 ) .",
    "the two most well known types of accretion outburst objects are , namely , the fu orionis objects ( fuors ) , which have a long burst duration of @xmath6100 years ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ) ; and the exor objects ( exors ) , which have a short duration ( @xmath6100 days ) and are repetitive ( herbig 1989 , 2008 ) . during the active burst stage",
    ", the protostellar accretion rate of the classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) can be enhanced from the typical values of @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 to up to @xmath610@xmath9 @xmath2 yr@xmath10 .",
    "the observational discovery of these outburst sources has provided the most promising solution to the _ luminosity problem _ in the quasi - stationary paradigm of low - mass star formation .",
    "this problem consists in that the observed mean accretion luminosity of embedded sources is 10 to 100 times smaller ( e.g kenyon 1993 ; evans et al . 2009 ; dunham & vorobyov 2012 ) than that required for the star to accrete most of its mass in the short ( @xmath11 years ) embedded timescale .",
    "this problem can be solved if the star accretes strongly during the accretion outburst episodes .",
    "while earlier optical surveys detected most of the outbursts from the ctts , recent optical and infrared monitoring observations have found that they are widespread from the class i to the class iii evolutionary stages ( audard et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the dust mass @xmath0 inferred from the 1.3 mm observations can be estimated based on the optically thin formula @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mean grain radius , @xmath14 is the mean density of dust grains , @xmath15 is the distance of the target , @xmath16(@xmath17)@xmath18@xmath19 is the grain emissivity , @xmath20 is the dust temperature , @xmath21 is the flux at the given wavelength , @xmath22 $ ] ( hildebrand 1983 ; lis et al .",

    "our assumptions effectively extrapolate dust opacity from shorter wavelength bands , and incorporate the effects of grain growth into the opacity index @xmath28 .",
    "our expression is equivalent to an assumed dust opacity of 0.67@xmath31 @xmath32g@xmath10 at 230 ghz .",
    "the adopted range of dust opacity well incorporates the expected values from theories , for @xmath61 - 100 mm maximum grain radius ( i.e. the assumed lowest opacity 0.35 corresponds to the case of @xmath610 cm maximum grain radius .",

    "we refer to isella et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and guilloteau et al .",

    "the derived dust masses , including upper limits , are provided in table [ tab : targets ] .        where @xmath34 is the mass absorption coefficient as a function of grain radius .",
    "this last parameter has been calculated by dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ; their figure 3 ) assuming a size distribution of dust grains taken to be a power law , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 , and a maximum grain radius @xmath37 . adopting @xmath36 = 3.5",
    ", we find that the ratio @xmath38 for observations made at @xmath17 = 1.3 mm shows three regimes as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath39 the ratio remains constant and the derived dust masses are not affected . for @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath38 first rises with increasing @xmath37 to reach at @xmath37 = 0.1 cm a value about 8 times larger than that in the @xmath39 regime .",
    "then the ratio decreases again to reach a value similar to that of the @xmath39 regime at @xmath37 = 10 cm .",
    "then , in this size range , the derived dust masses can actually be smaller than those derived by us in the small size limit .",
    "for the specific case of @xmath37 = 10 cm , the derived dust mass is approximately equal to that derived in the small size limit and our mass determinations or upper limits remain valid .",
    "finally , for @xmath41 the @xmath38 ratio starts to decrease , implying that the derived values and upper limits of the dust mass derived by us will start growing .",
    "then , for the case of very large grain sizes the amount of dust mass could be substantially larger that estimated here .",
    "the derived values and upper limits for @xmath0 in our sample span two orders of magnitude . with the exception of ny ori",
    ", it seems that the disk ( or disk plus inner envelope ) masses of exors are systematically lower than those of fuor objects ( kspl 2011 ; dunham & liu in prep . ) , although our small sample may be biased .",
    "exors in general seem to be more evolved than fuors , which also agrees with exors seemingly lower disk masses , although the difference in evolutionary phases between the two eruptive classes has recently started to wash out ( audard et al .",
    "2014 ) . despite the similar masses and spectral types of the host stars ( table [ tab : targets ]",
    "; also see hartigan & kenyon 2003 ) , from our millimeter observations we can not yet find a feature in common among the circumstellar disks of the observed exors . in particular , the non - detection of the nearest source vy tau places very stringent limits to the dust and gas masses",
    ". considering an upper limit of the gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 implies that the gas mass of the disk in vy tau is @xmath4210@xmath43 @xmath2 , which is 5 times lower than the mean gas mass of the t tauri disks in previous surveys ( andrews et al .",
    "2005 ; williams & cieza 2011 ) . the actual gas - to - dust mass ratio of vy tau is likely much lower than 100 given its late evolutionary stage .",
    "we find the small gas / dust mass in vy tau to be counterintuitive , because gravitational disk instabilities are more likely to occur in massive disks .",
    "ny ori has a sufficiently massive disk , such that gi+df or gi+mri are feasible triggering mechanisms for the accretion bursts .",
    "however , the short burst durations are not yet explained by current models .",
    "the mass estimates for the other three sources also appear to be too low to suggest gi - related mechanisms .",
    "recent astrometric and photometric monitoring observations of vy tau ( and its companion ) suggest that its outbursts are likely not triggered by encounters with the companion , which has a @xmath44350 yr orbital period ( dodin et al .",
    "ny ori and v1143 ori do not have a know companion , so a stellar encounter as their outburst triggering mechanism is disfavored .",
    "the projected separation between v1118 ori and its companion is @xmath676 au ( table [ tab : targets ] ) , thus the orbital period of v1118 ori and its companion should be @xmath45 yr .",
    "it seems that the outbursts of v1118 ori , which have a short duration and duty cycle , are not triggered by the encounters with its companion .",
    "the triggering mechanisms for the short duration , repetitive accretion bursts may be related to phenomena on the scales of the inner accretion disk ( e.g. , dangelo & spruit 2012 , kspl et al .",
    "2014 , hirose 2015 ) . whether the specific mechanism is interaction with planetary companions or not , and whether the outburst triggering mechanisms are also linked with the disk mass dispersal , remain as intriguing problems .",
