    "in a time of ` high - precision cosmology ' one of the fundamental questions about which we remain largely ignorant is the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "one of the most important breakthroughs in this field was the discovery of a significant population of far - ir - luminous , high - redshift sources in surveys at submillimetre ( submm ) and millimetre ( mm ) wavelengths using scuba and mambo ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; barger et al .  1999 ; eales et al .",
    "2000 ; bertoldi et al .",
    "2000 ) , resolving at least half of the far - ir / submm background detected by the _ dirbe _ and _ firas _ experiments ( e.g.  hauser et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it is widely believed that the large far - ir luminosities ( @xmath910@xmath10 ) of these sources is caused by intense uv light from starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) being absorbed by dust and re - radiated longwards of @xmath11@xmath0 m  .",
    "the negative @xmath12-correction at @xmath13@xmath0 m  allows submm / mm observations to select star - forming galaxies at @xmath14 in an almost distance - independent manner , providing an efficient method of finding obscured , star - forming galaxies at 1 @xmath15 10 ( blain & longair 1993 ) .",
    "the large star - formation rates ( @xmath61000@xmath16 ) found for ( sub)mm galaxies ( hereafter smgs ) are sufficient to construct a giant elliptical ( @xmath610@xmath17 ) in less than a gyr , providing that the starburst is continuously fueled .",
    "this has led people to speculate that smgs could be the progenitors of such galaxies ( e.g.  dunlop 2001 ) , a scenario which is further strengthened by the fact that the co - moving number density of smgs appears to be consistent with that of today s massive ellipticals ( scott et al .  2002 ; dunne , eales & edmunds 2003 ) . however , the nature of smgs , and in particular their relationship with possible present - day counterparts , is not known , just as their relation to other high - redshift populations such as lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and extremely red objects ( eros ) is not well understood .",
    "progress has been hampered by the large positional uncertainties of the smgs .",
    "the relatively large beams of ( sub)mm telescopes ( 1114@xmath7 , fwhm ) makes it impossible to reliably tie an smg to an optical or near - ir counterpart , unless additional data at a complementary wavelength are available .",
    "since a characteristic feature of both starburst galaxies and agn is radio emission , deep radio imaging has proven to be a highly efficient way of accurately identifying optical / near - ir counterparts to smgs ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 , 2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "use of the radio - to - submm spectral index as an redshift indicator ( hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; carilli & yun 1999 , 2000 ) has shown that the smgs lie at high redshift , with an estimated median redshift of @xmath18 ( ivison et al .",
    "recently , chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath690 smgs and found they span 0.8 @xmath15 4 , with a median of 2.4 , although they cautioned that the distribution might be skewed towards lower redshifts since a requirement for getting a spectrum was that the smgs had @xmath0jy counterparts in the radio .    in a very deep radio survey of the lockman hole and elaisn2 fields , ivison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that about one third of smgs did not have radio counterparts .",
    "one plausible explanation was that some of these radio - blank smgs lie at very high redshifts .",
    "such a population of smgs  the so - called ` high - redshift tail '  would ask difficult questions of popular hierarchical models . the high - redshift smgs would have low @xmath19 flux ratios ( see eales et al .",
    "2003 ) and would be readily detectable with mambo .",
    "blain , barnard & chapman ( 2003 ) , amongst others , have pointed out the limitations of photometric redshift techniques : the redshift is degenerate with the far - ir luminosity as parametrised by the dust temperature , @xmath20 . in principle , however , a comparison between the @xmath21 , @xmath22@xmath0 m  and 1.4-ghz flux densities allows us , in some cases at least , to break this degeneracy , assuming that smgs follow the radio / far - ir correlation .",
    "for example , an smg which has a warm @xmath19 ratio but has no radio counterpart is likely to be at high redshift .",
    "the @xmath19 redshift estimator is particular sensitive at @xmath23 and is currently the most effective way to assess whether there is a significant high - redshift tail of smgs .    the primary advantage of a mapping survey , rather than pointed photometry ( on  off ) observations of known sources ( e.g.  eales et al .  2003 ) , is that one obtains an unbiased view of the sky .",
    "data are not skewed by the choice of targets , by possible errors in coordinates , or by potentially spurious assumptions about how the sky is expected to appear .",
    "a key goal of our new survey was to determine unbiased flux densities for the radio - blank scuba sources using mambo , and to search for new populations of mm - bright sources , in particular a sign of a dusty , star - forming @xmath24 population  ` scuba drop - outs '  that would be expected to be below the typical scuba detection threshold at @xmath21@xmath0 m  but detectable by mambo at @xmath22@xmath0 m  .",
    "in this paper we present a new , unbiased @xmath22@xmath0 m  survey , using mambo on the iram 30 m telescope , of the lockman hole and elaisn2 , the two regions observed by the scuba 8mjy survey ( scott et al .",

    "the source extraction technique and the source catalogues for each field are presented in  4 , as are the results of monte carlo simulations to assess completeness , positional accuracy , flux boosting , etc . in  5 and 6",

    "the survey was carried out with the 37- and 117-channel mpifr max planck millimeter bolometer arrays ( mambo - i and mambo - ii ; kreysa et al .",
    "1998 ) at the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta near granada in spain . both mambo - i and mambo - ii",
    "are he@xmath30-cooled arrays operating at an effective frequency of 250ghz or @xmath22@xmath0 m  with a half - power spectral bandwidth of 80ghz . at @xmath22@xmath31 m",
    ", the 30 m telescope has an effective beam of 10.7@xmath7 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the arrays are background limited and the performance of the array routinely gives noise equivalent flux densities ( nefds ) of 30  45mjyhz@xmath32 .",
    "the bolometer feedhorns are arranged in a compact hexagonal pattern each with a diameter of @xmath33 which ensures an optimal coupling to the incoming radiation from a point source .",
    "mambo - ii is amongst the largest ( sub)mm bolometer arrays currently in use . in combination with the iram 30 m dish which has a surface accuracy of 75@xmath0 m rms",
    ", it is the most powerful tool for large blank - field surveys at ( sub)mm wavelengths , and will remain so until the advent of apex / laboca , jcmt / scuba2 and lmt / bolocam .    scan - mapping along the azimuthal direction is the only method available at the 30 m to map large areas of the sky .",
    "the signal from the sky is modulated by the secondary mirror ( the wobbler ) which is wobbling in the the scan direction ( azimuth ) .",
    "the wobbler frequency is 2hz which reflects a compromise between wanting to eliminate changes in the atmosphere on as short a timescale as possible and the challenges involved in moving a 2 m secondary at this frequency and keeping it mechanically stable .",
    "we used a standard on - the - fly mambo scan - map , typically @xmath34 in size , scanned at a velocity of 5@xmath7s@xmath29 , and with an elevation spacing between each subscan of 8@xmath7 .",
    "hence , a map consists of 41 subscans of 60s each .",
    "this results in a fully - sampled map over a @xmath34 region in @xmath643min ( this includes @xmath35s of overhead per subscan ) . in order to obtain uniform coverage , a regular grid with a grid - spacing of 2@xmath36",
    "was defined across each of the two fields .",
    "each grid position was observed once which in practice means that , in the final map , each point on the sky has been observed at least two times . in principle , this ensures that an rms of @xmath60.8mjybeam@xmath29 is reached across most of the field . in practice , however , scans were taken in slightly different weather conditions which means that the noise is not entirely uniform . in order to eliminate any possible systematics and any residual effects from the double beam profile",
    ", wobbler throws in the range @xmath37 were used .",
    "furthermore , maps were taken with different scan - directions , just as care was taken to map each grid position once while the field was rising and once while it was setting .",
    "all this served the purpose of minimising any systematic effects from the atmosphere and/or instrument which may otherwise had arisen from observing the same grid - position in two consecutive maps using identical wobbler- and scan - configuration .",
    "the two fields were only observed when above @xmath38 and below @xmath39 in elevation . the latter constraint , which avoids distorted scan - maps , was particularly troublesome for the elaisn2 field which reaches a maximum elevation of @xmath40 at pico veleta .",
    "since observations were pooled , they were done only under good weather conditions , i.e.   when the atmospheric zenith opacity at @xmath22@xmath0 m  was less than 0.3 , with low sky - background variations .",
    "after each map , i.e.  every hour , the telescope was pointed and focused .",
    "the opacity of the atmosphere was measured every other hour by doing a skydip but was also continuously monitored with a radiometer located next to the telescope .",
    "variations in the sky - background were monitored from the pointings by on - line measurements of the correlation of the horns across the array . also quick on - offs of the pointing sources",
    "were done throughout the night in order to check the sky noise and calibration . in order to tie down the absolute flux calibration , primary flux calibrators ( including planets when available )",
    "were observed at the beginning and end of each run , and resulted in an absolute flux calibration of better than 20 per cent .    in total",
    ", 34 scan - maps , corresponding to 26hrs , went into the final map of elaisn2 , all of which were obtained with mambo - ii as part of the pooled observing mode during the winter period of the 2001 - 2002 and 2002 - 2003 seasons .",
    "the bulk of the observations of the lockman hole were also obtained during that time using mambo - ii , although , early observations of the lockman hole during the winter of 200001 , and to some extent also 200102 , were obtained with the 37-channel mambo - i array . for the lockman hole , 19 and 51 scan - maps taken with mambo - i and mambo - ii ,",
    "respectively , were used for the final map , equivalent to a total integration time of 53hr .",
    "the areas surveyed were 160 arcmin@xmath1 in the elaisn2 field and 197 arcmin@xmath1 in the lockman hole . in the case of elaisn2",
    "the mambo observations were designed to cover the region observed at @xmath21@xmath0 m  as part of the scuba uk 8mjy survey ( scott et al .",
    "the small fraction of the scuba map which is not covered by our observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo_scuba_overlay ] ) is also the most noisy , and no @xmath21@xmath0 m  sources were detected in that region .",
    "however , in the lockman hole the overlap between mambo and scuba observations is complete , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo_scuba_overlay ] . the lockman hole mambo data presented in this paper are part of the larger area mambo deep field survey ( bertoldi et al .",

    "in addition , the lockman hole is being targeted by scuba as part of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey ( shades  _",
    "http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/shades/_ ) , and the data presented here constitute only a small part of the area surveyed at ( sub)mm wavelengths in that part of the sky .",
    "the data were reduced using the mopsi software package ( zylka 1998 ) .",
    "bolometers which were either dead or very noisy were flagged from the data reduction , and the remaining data streams were de - spiked , flat - fielded and corrected for atmospheric opacity .",
    "since all bolometers look through the same region of the atmosphere at any given time , there will be a correlated signal across the array which will have to be removed in order to recover the ( uncorrelated ) astronomical signal . in mopsi the removal of this correlated sky background",
    "is done in an iterative way . for each bolometer an inner and outer radius from the channel is specified , and the correlation with every bolometer lying within this annulus is computed . in our case , we chose an inner and outer radius of 1@xmath7 and 60@xmath7 , respectively , which is suitable for compact weak sources .",
    "the correlated signals of the surrounding 6 channels with the best correlation were then chosen and the average correlated noise subtracted from the bolometer in question .",
    "this procedure is then repeated until the sky background has been removed satisfactorily across the array .",
    "up until this point in the data reduction , the signal from each chopping position ( called the on and off phase ) was processed separately , the reason being that in a single phase the bolometers correlate much better which results in a much more reliable subtraction of the background .",
    "mopsi then calculated the phase difference , thereby effectively removing any electronic systematics between the data obtained in one wobbler position and the other .",
    "additional de - spiking and baseline - fitting was then done on the phase differences , from which the weights for each bolometer were calculated .",
    "finally , the data were restored and rebinned using a shift - and - add technique which for each map produces a positive image bracketed by two negative images of half the intensity located one wobbler throw away .",
    "the rebinning was done onto a grid of 1 square arcsec pixels , with the flux in each pixel being a noise - weighted average of the bolometers hitting that position .",
    "mopsi also outputs a weight image , @xmath41 , which at pixel position @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , i.e.  the error on the noise - weighted average , where @xmath12 denotes summing over the bolometers seen by pixel @xmath42 .",
    "the noise maps are shown in figure [ fig : noise - maps ] .",
    "the rms noise in the deepest parts of the maps is @xmath60.6mjybeam@xmath29 , increasing towards the edges .",
    "the lockman hole received more integration time than the elaisn2 field and as a result it is slightly deeper and has more uniform noise properties than the latter .",
    "scan - mapping is the only option for large area mapping at the iram 30 m telescope , and as a result the chopping direction is not fixed on the sky but varies with time which means that the chops are smeared out in the final map .",
    "hence , unlike scuba jiggle maps , one can not utilise the extra information contained in the position of the negative side - lobes for source extraction . instead",
    ", a simple matched - filtering technique was adopted , using a gaussian as the filter . however , as is seen from the noise images shown in figure [ fig : noise - maps ] , the noise is not entirely uniform across the two fields and any attempt at extracting sources has to take this into account .",
    "this was done by adopting a noise - weighted convolution technique similar to that of serjeant et al .",

    "this included the gehan , log rank , peto - peto , and peto - prentice tests , the latter being perhaps the most conservative and least sensitive to differences in the censoring patterns .",

    "however , based the monte carlo simulations in section [ section : monte - carlos ] we expect no more than 2 sources to be spurious in each of the mambo maps .",
    "this is an upper limit , given that the overlap between the scuba and mambo regions is only about 68 per cent of the areas covered by mambo .    while the above analysis suggests that astrometrical errors and spurious / flux - boosted sources are unable to account for the 12 mambo sources with @xmath127 , we caution that the low flux ratio could be due to the way we have estimated the upper flux limits . simply adopting the peak flux within a 10aperture might in some cases",
    "result in too low flux estimates and would tend to bias the mambo and scuba distributions towards lower and higher flux ratios , respectively . in figure",

    "<S> we present a deep , new 1200@xmath0 m  survey of the elaisn2 and lockman hole fields using the max planck millimeter bolometer array ( mambo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the areas surveyed are 160 arcmin@xmath1 in elaisn2 and 197 arcmin@xmath1 in the lockman hole , covering the entire scuba ` 8mjy survey ' . in total , 27 ( 44 ) sources have been detected at a significance @xmath24.0@xmath3 ( @xmath23.5@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the primary goals of the survey were to investigate the reliability of ( sub)millimetre galaxy ( smg ) samples , to analyse smgs using flux ratios sensitive to redshift at @xmath4 , and to search for ` scuba drop - outs ' , i.e.  galaxies at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we present the 1200@xmath0 m  number counts and find evidence of a fall at bright flux levels . employing parametric models for the evolution of the local 60@xmath0 m  _ iras _ luminosity function ( lf ) , we are able to account simultaneously for the 1200 and 850@xmath0 m  counts , suggesting that the mambo and scuba sources trace the same underlying population of high - redshift , dust - enshrouded galaxies . from a nearest - neighbour clustering analysis </S>",
    "<S> we find tentative evidence that the most significant mambo sources come in pairs , typically separated by @xmath623@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our mambo observations unambiguously confirm around half of the scuba sources . in a robust sub - sample of 13 smgs detected by both mambo and scuba at a significance @xmath23.5@xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> only one has no radio counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the distribution of 850/1200@xmath0 m  flux density ratios for this sub - sample is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift distribution of radio - detected smgs ( chapman et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2003 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have searched for evidence of a high - redshift tail of smgs amongst the 18 mambo sources which are not detected by scuba . while we can not rule out that some of them are scuba drop - outs at @xmath8 , their overall 850-to-1200@xmath0 m  flux distribution is statistically indistinguishable from that of the 13 smgs which were robustly identified by both mambo and scuba .    </S>",
