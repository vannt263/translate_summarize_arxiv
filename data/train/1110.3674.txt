    "optimal control problems are still an active area of current research despite the availability of powerful theoretical tools such as pontryagin s maximum principle or the hamilton - jacobi - bellman approach , that both provide conditions for optimality .",
    "however , numerical methods based on such optimality conditions rely on a certain number of assumptions that are often not met in practice . in addition , state constraints are particularly hard to handle for most of the methods .    on the other side",
    ", many numerical methods have been developed that deliver locally optimal solutions satisfying sufficient optimality conditions .",
    "however , the users of these methods are often left to wonder if a better solution exists .",
    "for example , in the particular case of impulsive controls , it is often not known if more regular solutions could provide a better cost .",
    "for a recent survey on impulsive control see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent application and for more references . for historical works",
    "see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a method based on @xcite but covering a larger class of solutions , including impulsive controls .",
    "this algorithm provides a sequence of non - decreasing lower bounds on the global minimizers of affine - in - the - control polynomial optimal control problems .",
    "in particular , it may assert the global optimality of local solutions found by other methods .",
    "as importantly , the algorithm is also able to provide numerical certificates of infeasibility or unboundedness for ill - posed problems . finally , in some cases , it is also possible to generate the globally optimal control law .    at the end of the paper , this method is successfully applied to the problem of coplanar space fuel - optimal linearised rendezvous .",
    "we show with two different examples from the literature that the proposed algorithm is able to retrieve the impulsive optimal solution conjectured by running a direct approach based on the solution of a linear programming ( lp ) problem . without assuming the nature of the propulsion ( continuous or impulsive ) , the obtained impulsive solution is certified to be a global fuel - optimal solution .",
    "the paper improves the method presented in @xcite in the following ways :    * impulsive control can now be taken into account . * because controls are represented by measures and not by variables , the size of sdp blocks is significantly reduced .",
    "this allows to handle larger problems in terms of number of state variables as well as to reach higher lmi relaxations .",
    "* total variation constraints can be handled very easily .",
    "these three improvements make it altogether possible to tackle problems such as consumption minimization for space rendezvous , the other significant contribution of this paper .",
