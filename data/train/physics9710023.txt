    "dynamical systems which display scale - free behaviour have attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "equilibrium thermodynamic systems do only exhibit scale - free behaviour for a subset of the parameter space of measure zero ( the critical values of the parameters ) .",
    "nevertheless , in nature scale - free systems can be found in abundant variety ( earthquakes  @xcite , avalanches in rice - piles  @xcite , infected people in epidemics  @xcite , jams in internet traffic  @xcite , extinction events in biology  @xcite , life - times of species  @xcite and many more .",
    "see also  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the origin of this abundance lies probably in the broad variety of systems far from equilibrium that can be found in nature . with the onset of non - equilibrium dynamics ,",
    "new mechanisms come into play which seem to make scale - free behaviour a generic feature of many systems .",
    "however , unlike equilibrium thermodynamics , where scaling is thoroughly understood  @xcite , for non - equilibrium dynamical systems there does not yet exist a unified theory of scale - free phenomena ( apart from non - equilibrium phase transitions ) .",
    "there do , however , exist several distinct classes of systems with generic scale - free dynamic .",
    "one of the first ideas to explain scale - free behaviour in a large class of dynamical systems was the notion of self - organized criticality ( soc ) proposed by bak , tang and wiesenfeld in 1987  @xcite .",
    "they proposed that certain systems with local interactions can , under the influence of a small , local driving force , self - organize into a state with diverging correlation length and therefore scale - free behaviour .",
    "this state is similar to the ordinary critical state that arises at the critical point in phase transitions , although no fine - tuning of parameters is necessary to reach it .",
    "since 1987 literally thousands of research papers have been written concerning soc ( for a review see  @xcite ) , and many different dynamical systems have been called soc ( e.g. @xcite ) , mostly just because they showed some power - law distributed activity patterns .",
    "recently  @xcite it has become clear that several soc models ( sandpile models , forest - fire models ) can be understood in terms of ordinary nonequilibrium critical phenomena ( like e.g.  @xcite ) . driving rate and dissipation act as critical parameters",
    ". the critical value , however , is 0 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to choose a small driving rate and dissipation to fine - tune the system to the critical point , and this choice is usually implicit in the definition of the model .",
    "scale - free behaviour does not , however , depend crucially on some sort of critical phenomenon .",
    "a simple multiplicative stochastic process ( msp ) of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are random variables , can produce a random variable @xmath6 with a probability - density function ( pdf ) with power - law tail  @xcite . in processes of this type",
    ", the power - law appears under relatively weak conditions on the pdf s of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , thus making the intermittend behaviour a generic feature of such models .",
    "applications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multstoch ] ) can be found in population dynamics with external sources  @xcite , epidemics  @xcite , price volatility in economics  @xcite , and others .",
    "another class of models with a very simple and robust mechanism to produce scale - free behaviour has been introduced recently by newman and sneppen  @xcite .",
    "these so called coherent - noise models consist of a large array of agents which are forced to reorganize under externally imposed stress . in their simplest form ,",
    "coherent - noise models do not have any interactions between the agents they consist of , and hence , certainly do not display criticallity .",
    "nevertheless , these models show a power - law distribution of the reorganization events with a wide range of different exponents  @xcite , depending on the special implementation of the basic mechanism .",
    "moreover they display power - law distributions in several other quantities , e.g. , the life - time distribution of the agents .",
    "these models have been used to study earthquakes  @xcite , rice piles  @xcite , and biological extinction  @xcite .",
    "coherent - noise models have a feature that usually is not present in soc models and is never present in msp s , which is the existence of aftershocks . in most coherent - noise models",
    "the probability for a big event to occur is very much increased immediately after a previous big event and then decays with a power - law .",
    "this leads to a fractal pattern of events that are followed by smaller ones which themselves are followed by even smaller ones and so on . in most soc models and all msp s , on the contrary",
    ", the state of the system is statistically identical before and after a big event .",
    "therefore in these models no aftershocks are visible .",
    "the existence or non - existence of aftershock events should be easily testable in natural systems .",
    "this could provide a means to decide what mechanism is most likely to be the cause for scale - free behaviour in different situations  @xcite .",
    "but to achieve this it is important to have a deep understanding of the decay - pattern of the aftershock events .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to investigate in detail the aftershock dynamics of coherent - noise models .",
    "we concentrate mainly on the original model introduced by newman and sneppen because there can be obtained several analytical results .",
    "we find a power - law decrease in time of the aftershocks probability to appear , as has been found already in  @xcite .",
    "but unlike stated there , we can show that the exponent does indeed depend on the microscopic details of the simulation .",
    "we find a wide range of exponents , from  0 to values well above  1 , whereas in  @xcite the authors report only the value  1 .",
    "we will now describe the model introduced by newman and sneppen  @xcite .",
    "the system consists of @xmath7 units or agents. every agent @xmath8 has a threshold @xmath9 again external stress .",
    "the thresholds are initially chosen at random from some probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is as follows :    1 .",
    "a stress @xmath11 is drawn from some distribution @xmath12 .",
    "all agents with @xmath13 are given new random thresholds , again from the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "a small fraction @xmath15 of the agents is selected at random and also given new thresholds .",
    "3 .   the next time - step begins with ( i ) .",
    "step ( ii ) is necessary to prevent the model from grinding to a halt . without this random reorganization the thresholds of the agents",
    "would after some time be well above the mean of the stress distribution and average stress could not hit any agents anymore .",
    "the most common choices for the threshold and stress distributions are a uniform threshold distribution and some stress distribution that is falling off quickly , like the exponential or the gaussian distribution . under these conditions",
    "( with reasonably small @xmath15 ) it is guaranteed that the distribution of reorganization events that arises through the dynamics of the system will be a power - law .",
    "there are several possibilities to extend the model to make it more general , without loss of the basic features .",
    "two extensions that have been studied by sneppen and newman  @xcite are    * a lattice version where the agents are put on a lattice and with every agent hit by stress its nearest neighbours undergo reorganization , even if their threshold is above the current stress level . * a multi - trait version where , instead of a single stress , there are @xmath16 different types of stress , i.e.  the stress becomes a @xmath16-dimensional vector @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly , every agent has a vector of thresholds @xmath18 .",
    "an agent has to move in this model whenever at least one of the components of the threshold vector is exceeded by the corresponding component of the stress vector .",
    "an extension that is especially important for the application of coherent noise models to biological evolution and the dynamics of mass extinctions has been studied recently by wilke and martinetz  @xcite . in biology",
    "it is not a good assumption to keep the number of agents ( in this case species ) constant in time .",
    "rather , species which go extinct should be removed , and there should be a steady regrowth of new species . in a generalized model , the system size is allowed to vary .",
    "agents that are hit by stress are removed from the system completely , but at the end of every time - step a number @xmath19 of new agents is introduced into the system . here @xmath19 is a function of the actual system size @xmath7 , the maximal system size @xmath20 and some growth rate @xmath21 .",
    "wilke and martinetz have studied in detail the function @xmath22 which resembles logistic growth . in the limit @xmath23 their model reduces to the original one by newman and sneppen . in the following",
    "we will refer to the original model as the infinite - growth version and to the model introduced by wilke and martinetz as the finite - growth version.",
    "we base our analysis of the aftershock structure on the meassurement - procedure proposed by sneppen and newman  @xcite .",
    "they drew a histogram of all the times whenever an event of size  @xmath24 some constant @xmath25 happened after an initial event of size  @xmath24 some constant @xmath26 , for all events @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , we measure the frequency of events larger than @xmath25 occuring exactly @xmath0 time - steps after an initial event larger than @xmath26 , for all times @xmath0 .",
    "this means that we consider sequences of events in the aftermath of initial large events .",
    "normalized appropriately , our measurement gives just the probability to find an event @xmath28 at time @xmath0 after some arbitrarily chosen event @xmath29 .",
    "for this to make sense in the context of aftershocks we usually have @xmath30 . throughout the rest of this paper we use @xmath26 and @xmath25 as percentage of the maximal system size .",
    "therefore a value @xmath31 for example means that we are looking for initial events which span the whole system .",
    "we will denote the probability to find an event of size @xmath32 at time @xmath0 after a previous large event by @xmath33 . in order to keep the notation simple",
    "we omit the constant @xmath26",
    ". it will be clear from the context what @xmath26 we use in different situations .",
    "note that @xmath33 is not a probability distribution , but a function of time @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , every increase or decrease of @xmath33 in time will indicate correlations between the initial event and the subsequent aftershocks .",
    "for @xmath34 we expect all correlations to disappear , and hence @xmath33 to tend towards a constant .",
    "it is possible to obtain some analytical results about the probability @xmath33 if we restrict ourself to the model with infinite growth and a special choice for the threshold and stress distributions . if not indicated otherwise , throughout the rest of this section we assume @xmath10 to be uniform between 0 and 1 , and the stress distribution to be exponential : @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the case @xmath31 .",
    "that means that we are looking at the events in the aftermath of an initial event of infinite size , an event that spans the whole system .",
    "this is a reasonable situation because we use a uniform threshold distribution . in this case",
    "there is a finite probability to generate a stress @xmath11 which exceedes the largest threshold , thus causing the whole system to reorganize .",
    "for some of the examples presented in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] the probability to find an infinite event is even higher than @xmath36 .",
    "this probability can be considered relatively large in a system where one has to do about @xmath37 time - steps to get a good statistics .      the exact way to calculate",
    "@xmath33 is the following .",
    "one has to compute the distribution @xmath38 which is the distribution that arises if after the big event at time @xmath39 a sequence of stress values @xmath40 is generated during the following time steps",
    ". then the equation @xmath41 has to be solved . that gives the quantity @xmath42 , the threshold that has to be exceeded by the stress at time @xmath0 to generate an event @xmath28 . from the stress distribution",
    "one can then calculate the corresponding probability @xmath43 .",
    "finally the average over all possible sequences @xmath40 has to be taken to end up with the exact solution for @xmath33 .",
    "obviously there is no hope doing this analytically .    instead of the exact solution for @xmath33 we can calculate a mean - field solution if we average over all possible sequences @xmath40 before we solve eq .",
    "( [ exact_cal_p ] ) .",
    "note that in this context , the notion mean - field does not stand for the average state of the system , which does not tell us anything about aftershocks , but for the average fluctuations typically found in a time - intervall @xmath44 .",
    "these average fluctuations are a measure for the return to the average state , after a large event has caused a significant departure from it . consequently , the mean - field solution is time - dependent . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the time - dependent mean - field threshold distribution converges to the average threshold distribution , denoted by @xmath46 in  @xcite    in appendix  [ a : master - equation ] , we show that the averaging over all fluctuations in a time intervall of @xmath0 time - steps equals to @xmath0 times iterating the master - equation . therefore , to calculate the mean - field solution for @xmath33 we have to insert @xmath47 , the @xmath0-th iterate of the master - equation , into eq .",
    "( [ exact_cal_p ] ) .",
    "the details of this calculation are given in appendix  [ a : master - iteration ] .",
    "in this paragraph we will calculate the dependency of the exponent @xmath2 on @xmath25 under the assumption that the probability to find aftershocks decays indeed as a power - law , i.e.  that we can assume @xmath48 .",
    "a fairly simple argument shows that for the probability @xmath33 to decrease as a power - law the exponent @xmath2 must be proportional to @xmath49 for @xmath25 not too small .",
    "again we concentrate on exponentially distributed stress only .",
    "we begin with an approximation of the quantity @xmath50 , which is the average threshold at time @xmath0 above which a stress value must lie to trigger an event of size @xmath28 . in the mean - field approximation , @xmath50 is defined by the equation @xmath51 because @xmath47 and @xmath25 are normalized , we can rewrite this equation ( again we assume @xmath52 to be uniform between 0 and 1 ) : @xmath53 for the most reasonable stress distributions the distribution of the agents @xmath47 forms a plateau in the region close to @xmath54 . therefore for sufficient large @xmath25 we can approximate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ reversed_integral ] ) by substituting @xmath47 with its value at @xmath54 , which is @xmath55 .",
    "( [ reversed_integral ] ) then becomes @xmath56 the values @xmath55 are a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we define @xmath57 and find for @xmath50 : @xmath58 the probability @xmath33 now becomes @xmath59    the principal idea to derive a relation between @xmath2 and @xmath25 is as follows .",
    "the function @xmath60 is obviously independent of @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath48 , rearrange eq .",
    "( [ p_texp ] ) for @xmath60 and then get a condition on @xmath2 and @xmath25 since they should cancel exactly .",
    "hence we have to solve the equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the constant of proportionality .",
    "we take the logarithm on both sides to get @xmath63 and finally @xmath64 this is of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 for every function of the form @xmath65 , the constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 are unique , as can be seen if we write @xmath70 a change in @xmath69 results in a rescaling of the variable @xmath0 , while a change in @xmath68 results in a rescaling of the whole function .",
    "consequently , neither @xmath68 nor @xmath69 can depend on @xmath2 or @xmath25 .",
    "this can be seen as follows . if , e.g. , @xmath68 depended on @xmath25 , then a change in @xmath25 would rescale the function @xmath60 .",
    "but this function is independent of @xmath25 according to its definition ( eq .  ( [ rtdef ] ) ) .",
    "hence @xmath68 must be independent of @xmath25 in itself .",
    "a similar argument holds for the variable @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 and @xmath2 must cancel exactly in eq .",
    "( [ c_1def ] ) .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath71    up to now we have not done any assumptions about the size of the first big event after which we are measuring the subsequent aftershocks . therefore the proportionality @xmath72 should hold in general , as long as @xmath25 is not too small . if we additionally assume the inital event to have infinite size ( @xmath31 ) we can easily calculate the constant @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ p_texp2 ] ) .",

    "but this result is more general .",
    "for @xmath82 the probability @xmath33 reads simply @xmath83 and hence is constant in time .",
    "consequently we have @xmath84 for any stress distribution . from continuity",
    "we have @xmath81 as @xmath80 .",
    "a similar argument holds when either @xmath26 or @xmath25 approaches 0 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the probability @xmath33 reduces to the mean probability to find an event of size @xmath32 .",
    "hence @xmath84 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the probability @xmath33 becomes 1 , because an event of size at least zero can be found in every time step .",
    "hence also in this case @xmath84 . from continuity",
    "we have again @xmath81 as either @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "in the previous section we have focused on the behaviour of the system in the aftermath of an infinite event .",
    "this situation is not only analytically tractable , but it also makes it simpler to obtain good numerical results . if we want to measure the probability to find aftershocks following events exceeding some finite but large @xmath26 , we have to wait a long time for every single measurement since the number of those large events vanishes with a power - law .",
    "this makes it hard to get a good statistics within a reasonable amount of computing time .",
    "if , on the other hand , we focus on the situation of an infinite initial event , we can simply initialize the agents with the uniform threshold distribution , take the measurement up to the time @xmath0 we are interested in and repeat this procedure until the desired accuracy is reached .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the results reported below have been obtained in this way , and with exponentially distributed stress .",
    "the @xmath0-th iteration of the master - equation should give exactly the average distribution of the agent s thresholds at time @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_t ] it can be seen that this is indeed the case .",
    "the points , which represent simulation results , lie exactly on the solid lines , which stem from the exact analytical calculation .",
    "the mean - field approximation for @xmath33 should be valid if the agent s distribution at time @xmath0 does not fluctuate too much about the average distribution @xmath47 .",
    "since there are many more small events than big ones the fluctuations should occur primarily in the region of small @xmath89 . consequently we expect the mean - field approximation to be valid for large @xmath25 , and to break down for small @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig_mf1 ] shows that already for moderately large @xmath25 the mean - field approximation captures the behaviour of @xmath33 , with a slight tendency to underestimate the results of the measurement .",
    "note that the statistics is becoming worse with increasing @xmath25 due to the rapidly decreasing probability to find any events of size @xmath28 for large @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_limf ] a measurement of the probability @xmath90 is presented for a number of simulations with different values of the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "as it can be seen , the parameter @xmath15 does not affect the exponent of the power - law , but limits the region where scaling can be observed .",
    "note the difference between the effect seen here and typical cut off effects in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "the quantity @xmath90 is not a probability distribution , but a time dependent probability , which tends towards a constant for @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we do not see an exponential decrease at the cut off timescale . instead , the probability @xmath90 levels out to the time - averaged value @xmath91 , which is the average probability to find events of size @xmath32 .",
    "in section [ sect : approx_tau ] we showed that @xmath92 , under the condition of a sufficiently large @xmath25 .",
    "simulations indicate that the constant of proportionality is just 1 , which means the constant @xmath68 in eq .",

    ". in these systems , there exists some competitive dynamics between the removal of agents with small thresholds through stress and their regrowth .",
    "aftershocks appear in the infinite growth model because the reorganization event leaves a larger proportion of agents in the region of small thresholds , thus increasing the probability for succeding large events . in the finite growth version , on the contrary , this can happen only if the regrowth is faster than the constant removal of agents with small thresholds through average stress .",
    "if the regrowth is too slow , the probability to find large events actually is decreased in the aftermath of an initial large event .",
    "the interplay between these two mechanisms is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_grow ] .",
    "the regrowth of species is done according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : logistic_growth ] ) .",

    "the maximum moves to the left to earlier times @xmath0 with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath21 is so large that the maximum coincides with the post initial event , the original power - law is restored .",

    "consequently , with a different set of parameters the curves will look different , and the maximum will appear at a different time .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the qualitative behaviour is not altered if we change @xmath26 or @xmath25 .    instead of logistic growth",
    ", we can also think of linear growth , i.e.@xmath104 , where @xmath21 is again the growth rate . in order to keep the system finite ,",

    "therefore the time intervall in which aftershocks are suppressed is much shorter for linear growth .",
    "we could show in the present paper that the decay pattern of the aftershock events depends on the details of the measurement .",
    "although the qualitative features remain the same for different parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 ( e.g.  a power - law decrease in the infinite - growth version ) , the quantitative features vary to a large extend .",

    "omori s law , which interests us here , is a similar statement for the aftershocks decay pattern of earthquakes . in the data from real earthquakes , the number of events larger than a certain magnitude @xmath106 decreases as @xmath1 in the aftermath of a large initial earthquake .",
    "consequently , we can only apply infinite - growth coherent - noise models to earthquakes .",
    "but this is certainly no drawback , since we expect the thresholds against movement at various points along a fault ( with which we identify the agents of the coherent - noise model ) to reorganize almost instantaneously during an earthquake .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 is not universal , but can vary significantly , e.g. , in  @xcite from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "this would cause problems if the statement was true that for coherent - noise models we have @xmath109 .",
    "but as we could show above , the exponent can assume values in the observed range , depending on the stress distribution , the size of the initial event , and the lower cut - off ( which we called @xmath106 for earthquakes and @xmath25 throughout the rest of the paper ) .",
    "for a further comparison , it should be interesting to study the dependency of the exponent @xmath2 on variation of the cut - off @xmath106 in real data .",
    "we are only aware of a single work where that has been done  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the authors do not find a clear dependency @xmath110 .",
    "nevertheless , this is not a strong evidence against coherent - noise models , since the aftershock series analysed in  @xcite consists mainly of very large earthquakes with magnitude between 6 and about 8 , which does not allow a sufficient variation of @xmath106 .",
    "statistical variations in the exponent @xmath2 are probably larger for this aftershock series than the possible variations because of an assumed @xmath110 dependency .",
    "numerical simulations of the finite - growth version have revealed a much more complex structure of aftershock events than present in the infinite - growth version .",
    "the competition between regrowth of agents and agent removal through reorganization events leads to a pattern where the probability to find events after an initial large event is suppressed for short times , enhanced for intermediate times and then falls off to the background level for long times .",
    "this observation can be important for the application of coherent - noise models to biological extinction .",
    "it might be possible to identify a time of reduced and a time of enhanced extinction activity in the aftermath of a mass extinction event in the fossil record .",
    "this would be a good indication for biological extinction to be dominated by external influences ( coherent - noise point of view ) rather than by coevolution ( soc point of view ) .",
    "we thank mark newman for interesting conversations about coherent - noise models .",
    "in this appendix we are interested in the average state a coherent - noise system will be found in several time - steps after some initial state with threshold distribution @xmath111 .",
    "our calculations will lead to a rederivation of the master - equation for coherent - noise systems .",
    "although a master - equation has already been given for the infinite - growth version and has been generalized to the finite - growth version , these master - equations have not been derived in a stringent way , but just have been written down intuitively .",
    "our calculation will confirm the main terms of the previously used equations , but we will find an additional correcting term that becomes important for large @xmath15 .    consider the case of infinite growth . at time",
    "@xmath112 the threshold - distribution may be @xmath111 .",
    "we construct the distribution @xmath113 , which is the distribution that arises at time @xmath114 if a stress @xmath11 is generated at time @xmath112 . a stress",
    "@xmath11 will cause a proportion @xmath115 of the agents to move .",
    "we have to distinguish two regions . for @xmath116 ,",
    "all agents are removed .",
    "then they are redistributed according to @xmath117 .",
    "a small fraction @xmath15 of the agents is then mutated , which results in @xmath118 for @xmath119 , the redistribution of the agents gives @xmath120 . with the subsequent mutation",
    "we obtain : @xmath121    we take the average over @xmath11 to get the distribution @xmath122 that will on average be found one time - step after @xmath111 : @xmath123 \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\int\\limits_0^x \\!d\\eta\\ , p_{\\rm stress }    ( \\eta ) \\rho_{t_0 } ( x)(1-f ) \\notag\\\\   & =   p_{\\rm thresh}(x)\\big[f+(1-f)\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\!d\\eta\\ ,    p_{\\rm stress}(\\eta ) \\int\\limits_0^\\eta          \\rho_{t_0}(x')dx'\\big ] \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\rho_{t_0 } ( x)(1-f)(1-p_{\\rm move}(x))\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath124 is the probability for an agent with threshold @xmath89 to get hit by stress , viz .",
    "@xmath125 . to proceed",
    "further we have to interchange the order of integration in the remaining double integral .",
    "note that @xmath126 , and therefore @xmath127 \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\rho_{t_0 } ( x)(1-f)(1-p_{\\rm move}(x ) ) \\notag\\\\   & =   p_{\\rm thresh}(x)\\big[f+(1-f)\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\!dx'\\ ,           \\rho_{t_0}(x')p_{\\rm move}(x')\\big ] \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\rho_{t_0 } ( x)(1-f)(1-p_{\\rm move}(x ) ) \\notag\\\\   & =   p_{\\rm thresh}(x)\\int\\limits_0^\\infty \\!dx'\\,\\big (          f+(1-f ) p_{\\rm move}(x')\\big)\\rho_{t_0}(x ' ) \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\rho_{t_0 } ( x)(1-f)(1-p_{\\rm move}(x ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we are thus led to the master - equation @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the normalization constant @xmath130 .",
    "we notice the appearance of the term @xmath131 which was not present in the master - equation used by sneppen and newman .",
    "the term arises if one takes into account the fact that the agents which are hit by stress get new thresholds before the mutation takes place .",
    "therefore every agent with threshold @xmath89 has the probability @xmath132 to get two new thresholds in one time - step .",
    "but obviously this is exactly the same as geting only one new threshold .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath131 has to be present to avoid double - counting of those agents which are hit both by stress and by mutation .",
    "nevertheless , this term does not affect the scaling behaviour of the system , because the derivation of the event size distribution in  @xcite has been done under the assumption @xmath133 .",
    "( [ master_cont ] ) gives the average state of the system one time - step after the initial state @xmath111 .",
    "if we are interested in the average state @xmath0 time - steps after the initial state , we have to repeat the calculations in eqs .",
    "( [ rhostep])-([master_cont ] ) @xmath0 times .",
    "since all averages in these calculations can be taken independently , this is exactly the same as @xmath0 times iterating the master - equation ( [ master - equation ] ) .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath39 a big event takes place and produces the distribution @xmath75 .",
    "if we apply the master - equation ( [ master - equation ] ) @xmath0 times to this distribution @xmath75 , we will end up with a distribution @xmath47 that tells us the average state of the system at time @xmath0 after the big event .",
    "in the following we will use @xmath134 and write @xmath135 for the normalization constant that appears on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ master - equation ] ) at time @xmath0 .",
    "the average distribution at time @xmath0 then becomes @xmath136 we integrate both sides of eq .",
    "( [ master - t ] ) and find a recursion relation for the constants @xmath135 : @xmath137 all integrals can be calculated analytically for a special choice of the threshold and stress distributions . as threshold distribution ,",
    "we choose the uniform distribution @xmath138 , and as stress distribution we choose the exponential distribution @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the initial event was so large as to span the whole system , i.e. @xmath140 .    under the above assumptions there is basically one integral that appears in eq .",
    "( [ at - recursion ] ) , which is @xmath141 and eq .",
    "( [ at - recursion ] ) becomes @xmath142 with the aid of the binomial expansion @xmath143 we find @xmath144    we are now in the position to calculate the probability that an event of size @xmath32 occurs at time @xmath0 after the initial big event .",
    "the minimal stress value @xmath145 that suffices on average to generate such an event is the solution to the equation @xmath146 the corresponding probability is @xmath147 .",
    "we invert this expression and insert it into eq .",
    "( [ eta_mineq ] ) .",
    "the resulting equation determines the probability @xmath33 : @xmath148 the integrals that appear after inserting @xmath47 into the above equation are very similar to the integral @xmath149 defined in eq .",
    "( [ i_ndef ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath150 this integral can be taken in the same fashion as the calculation of @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ i_ncomp ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath151 eq .  ( [ p - eq ] ) now becomes @xmath152 all the quantities which appear in this equation are given above in analytic form .",
    "therefore solving eq .",
    "( [ p - eq2 ] ) is simply a problem of root - finding . with a computer - algebra program such as mathematica",
    ", the recursion relation for the constants @xmath153 as well as the sums that appear in the quantities @xmath149 and @xmath154 can be evaluated analytically if we restrict ourselves to moderate @xmath0 .",
    "then the only numerical calculation involved in the computation of @xmath33 is the calculation of the root of eq .",
