    "taking the viewpoint that classical zero forcing is a kind of  graph infection \" or ",

    "we want to mention here that curtis miller has independently formulated a number of probabilistic variants of zero forcing  @xcite .",
    "but our present definition , as well as our approach and emphasis , is distinct from the ones he considered ( personal communication ) . notice that , once a classical zero forcing ( black ) set @xmath34 containing an initial black set @xmath35 of @xmath1 is attained through probabilistic zero forcing , classical zero forcing will be in force as a part of probabilistic zero forcing ; before then , some combination of classical and probabilistic zero forcing occurs .",

    "+ we observe that , starting with a colored graph @xmath47 of order @xmath37 in @xmath85 , by the fact that the black set is expanding ( or non - contracting ) from any @xmath86 to each @xmath87 , the number of colored graphs ( and hence the size of the transition matrix ) requiring consideration is typically and tremendously reduced from @xmath77 .",
    "recall that , in the theory of markov processes , an _ absorbing state _ is one that can not be exited once entered ; i.e. , it is a state @xmath79 such that @xmath88 ; a state @xmath79 is _ transient _ ( also called _ non - recurrent _ ) if there is a state @xmath83 reachable from @xmath79 , but state @xmath79 is not reachable from @xmath83 . if there is only one absorbing state @xmath89 , then @xmath90 for each state @xmath79 ( see p.247 and p.241 of  @xcite , also see pp.58 - 66 of  @xcite for proofs ) .",
    "since our dynamical system has transient states except for one absorbing state ( the colored graph @xmath91 where all vertices of @xmath91 are black ) , we have the following      that is , a colored graph will turn entirely black with probability one as the number of steps @xmath45 goes to infinity . the following is an instructive example .",
