    "einstein gravity is the most successful theory to describe gravitation . however ,",
    "if we include quantum effects , einstein gravity can not be a fundamental theory , and hence a quantum theory of gravity is required .",
    "this quantum gravity should be approximated by the einstein gravity in the low energy limit , but before approaching the einstein gravity , there may be some effects that modify the einstein gravity .",
    "in fact , a theory of gravity does not definitively have to be einstein gravity .",
    "there can be many variations and we choose one theory via observations .",
    "we then need to find possible modified gravity theories and check their possible implications .",
    "if quantum gravity is approximated by a modified gravity theory , and if the theory has experimental implications , it will be profoundly important to understand the nature of quantum gravity .",
    "one of the most canonical modified gravity theory candidates is the brans - dicke theory @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the brans - dicke field , and @xmath7 is the brans - dicke coupling constant . historically , the brans - dicke theory was suggested to implement mach s principle .",
    "the roll of the gravitation constant @xmath8 is replaced by the brans - dicke field @xmath9 .",
    "since the brans - dicke field can be dynamic , the strength of gravity can be relatively different for each points .",
    "it makes that the equivalence principle has more freedom than the original einstein gravity , since the equivalence principle holds for each points independently .",
    "then , intuitively , we can recover the einstein gravity in the large @xmath10 limit , since the field dynamics of the brans - dicke field will be highly suppressed in the limit .",
    "moreover , the brans - dicke gravity has other theoretical motivations .",
    "notably , it appears that it is the simplest form of modified gravity using a scalar field .",
    "therefore , some important intuitions of the brans - dicke theory can be applied to other possible modified gravity theories .",
    "for example , we may apply similar intuitions to dilaton gravity , non - minimally coupled theory , etc .",
    "the brans - dicke theory can be motivated by string theory inspired models .",
    "for example , the brans - dicke theory is the weak coupling limit of dilaton gravity ( @xmath11 ) , where the dilaton field is a direct consequence of string theory @xcite . also , the brans - dicke theory is a weak field limit of the randall - sundrum model @xcite , where , on the positive tension brane",
    ", @xmath7 is sufficiently large ; on the negative tension brane , @xmath12 @xcite@xcite .",
    "of course , the observed limitation of the coupling is @xmath13 @xcite ; however , it is still meaningful to study other values of @xmath7 since they can be realized in the context of string theory , and hence they can show properties which are allowed by string theory",
    ". for further discussions , see appendix  a.    if the brans - dicke field is added to einstein gravity , it can work as a source of an exotic matter . in the context of cosmology , there have been some discussions that the brans - dicke field can be a candidate for dark matter or dark energy @xcite . in particular , it can be useful to study exotic matters that violates the null energy condition .",
    "the theory can allow some strange geometry , e.g. , wormholes @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we know how to deal with the brans - dicke field so as to obtain a sufficient amount of exotic matters , then we can reasonably make an assumption of exotic matter , since the exotic matter may thus be naturally obtained from a well - known and not artificial field",
    ".    although the study of the brans - dicke field is important , solutions to the brans - dicke theory are more difficult than those involving einstein gravity . of course",
    ", we can find some analytic solutions .",
    "however , to observe the real dynamics when a black hole is formed and evolved , more detailed calculations are needed .",
    "the collapsing matter will affect the background , and the background will affect the brans - dicke field .",
    "the affected brans - dicke field will then give a back - reaction to the background geometry .",
    "these processes are not easy to understand in an analytic way and it is necessary to use numerical calculations for their elucidation .",
    "previous papers have studied brans - dicke black holes using adm formalism @xcite . however , in this paper , we use double - null formalism @xcite@xcite@xcite for the numerical calculations @xcite@xcite , thus making it easier to study the causal structures and also to plot all possible fields including the energy - momentum tensors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study responses of the brans - dicke field during the gravitational collapse of a matter .",
    "we prepare a flat background with a pulse of a normal scalar matter field and we then observe the response of the brans - dicke field .",
    "we thereupon observe that dynamical responses of the brans - dicke field are highly non - trivial .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : mod ] , we discuss the details of our numerical simulations ; in section  [ sec : res ] , we discuss the results of our simulations and report some interesting observations ; in section  [ sec : inter ] , we document observations in terms of two issues ( late time behaviors and dynamical behaviors ) and discuss their physical interpretations ; and in section  [ sec : con ] , we summarize the possible causal structures and discuss the physical meanings and implications .",
    "the lagrangian of the brans - dicke theory with a scalar field becomes @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 is the brans - dicke field , and @xmath15 is a minimally coupled scalar field with potential @xmath16 . here , @xmath7 is the brans - dicke coupling constant which is a free parameter of the theory .",

    "we can then implement the same integration scheme used in previous papers @xcite@xcite to solve the brans - dicke theory .",
    "we used the second order runge - kutta method @xcite .",

    ". then , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we use a shell - shaped scalar field , and hence its interior is not affected by the shell .",
    "thus , we can simply choose @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "also , @xmath58 holds .",
    "then , since the asymptotic mass function @xcite @xmath59 should vanish at @xmath60 , it is convenient to choose @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "we can choose an arbitrary function for @xmath69 to induce a collapsing pulse . in this paper , we use @xmath70 for @xmath71 and otherwise @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the width of the pulse and @xmath74 is the amplitude . then we obtain @xmath75 for @xmath71 and otherwise @xmath76 .",
    "this implements one pulse of energy ( @xmath77 ) along the out - going null direction by a differentiable function @xmath78 .",

    "from the work of previous authors using brans - dicke theory , we know that a gravitational collapse should lead to the emergence of an einstein black hole asymptotically @xcite . as the black holes emerge to einstein black holes , some interesting observations can be made . to understand these observations , in this section",

    "( see the cases of @xmath99 and @xmath114 in figure  [ fig : sb ] . ) therefore , the dynamics during the collapse of matter will be similar to that of einstein gravity and we can ignore the effect of the brans - dicke field .",

    "second , we observed the fully dynamical behaviors _ during _ the gravitational collapse and viewed the energy - momentum tensor components .    for the late time behaviors ,",
    "if @xmath7 is greater ( or smaller ) than @xmath0 , the brans - dicke field decreases ( or increases ) during the gravitational collapse ( figure  [ fig : sb ] ) .",
    "since the brans - dicke field should be relaxed to the asymptotic value with the elapse of time , the final apparent horizon becomes time - like ( or space - like ) ( figure  [ fig : varying_omega ] ) .",
    "for the dynamical behaviors , we observed the energy - momentum tensors around @xmath111 .",
    "if @xmath12 , the @xmath2 component can be negative at the outside of the black hole .",
    "this allows an instantaneous inflating region during the gravitational collapse ( figure  [ fig : lesst ] ) . if @xmath106 , the oscillation of the @xmath3 component allows the apparent horizon to shrink ( figure  [ fig : moret ] ) . in this case",
    ", we could find a combination of initial conditions that allows a violation of weak cosmic censorship ( figures  [ fig : varying_a ] and [ fig : varying_vf ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : classification ] , we summarize and classify all solutions in this paper .    *",
    "if @xmath10 is sufficiently large , the @xmath93 horizon is space - like . * if @xmath101 is sufficiently small , then the @xmath93 horizon can be time - like after the matter collapse . *",
    "if @xmath12 , there can be @xmath94 horizons .",
    "after the matter collapse , the @xmath93 horizons are time - like . *",
    "if @xmath106 , we can find an initial condition that the @xmath93 horizon shrinks to the singularity and eventually a space - like @xmath93 horizon and a singularity appears .",
    "we can see a cauchy horizon . *",
    "if @xmath106 , we also find an initial condition that the @xmath93 horizon shrinks but not to a singularity",
    ". then , we see an oscillation of the @xmath93 horizon . * in @xmath106 case",
    ", we can find an initial condition that the cauchy horizon can be maintained infinitely .",
    "finally , we remark on some physical implications of our results .",
    "first , in the @xmath12 limit , we could see a violation of the null energy condition for the @xmath2 component .",
    "this condition is a necessary condition to induce a bubble universe using a false vacuum bubble @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to check further calculations to ascertain whether this is in fact useful ; but one lesson is that , in brans - dicke theory or similar type of theory , we may apply the back - reaction of a gravitational collapse to induce the negative @xmath2 part .",
    "second , in the @xmath106 limit , we could see a violation of weak cosmic censorship . even though the cauchy horizon extends infinitely",
    ", it is reasonable to speculate that a schwarzschild black hole will be formed beyond the cauchy horizon .",
    "however , it is also true that we can not determine what happens beyond the cauchy horizon .",
    "these situations were not observed using numerical simulations by previous authors @xcite .",
    "therefore , there should be further studies for this clear counterexample of weak cosmic censorship .",
    "the authors would like to thank ewan stewart , alex nielsen , gungwon kang , and sungwook hong for discussions and encouragement .",
    "this work was supported by korea research foundation grants ( krf-313 - 2007-c00164 , krf-341 - 2007-c00010 ) funded by the korean government ( moehrd ) and bk21 .",
    "for observational tests , it is known that the value of @xmath7 should be greater than @xmath173 @xcite . however , in various physical situations , small @xmath7 parameters can be allowed . even though the small @xmath7 is not for our universe ,",
    "if small @xmath7 is allowed in fundamental theory and may be realizable in somewhere of multiverse , and if such small value of @xmath7 has some implications , e.g. , violation of unitarity or cosmic censorship , the study of responses of the brans - dicke field for small @xmath7 will have theoretical importance .",
    "one example is the dilaton gravity which has the effective action as the following form @xcite : @xmath174 where @xmath66 is the space dimensions , @xmath175 is the length scale of string units , @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath15 is the dilaton field . if we define @xmath6 as @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the @xmath178 dimensional gravitation constant , then we obtain the brans - dicke theory with @xmath116 limit .",
    "if there are higher loop corrections from string theory , there will be other coupling terms of @xmath6 and hence the brans - dicke theory should be modified .",
    "hence , the correspondence between the dilaton gravity and the brans - dicke theory is only for weak coupling limit ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "however , it is reasonable to think that brans - dicke theory with @xmath11 limit is a good toy model to study phenomena of dilaton gravity .    in the first model of randall and sundrum @xcite",
    ", they introduced two branes to explain the hierarchy problem .",
    "because of the warp factor between two branes , we obtain a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane in an anti de sitter background . according to garriga and tanaka @xcite",
    ", each branes can be described by brans - dicke theory in the weak field limit with the @xmath7 parameter @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the location of the negative tension brane along the fifth dimension , @xmath182 is the length scale of the anti de sitter space , and the sign @xmath183 denotes the sign of the tension . to explain the hierarchy problem , we require @xmath184",
    ". then we obtain sufficiently large @xmath7 on the positive tension brane and @xmath185 on the negative tension brane .",
    "however , in principle , @xmath186 can be chosen arbitrarily and hence one may guess that various @xmath7 near @xmath187 may be allowed by models from brane world .    for more discussions , see @xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we report on convergence and consistency tests for our simulations .",
    "we used @xmath11 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 case .    for convergence , we compared finer simulations : @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 times finer . in figure",
    "[ fig : convergence ] , we see that the difference between the @xmath188 and @xmath189 times finer cases is @xmath108 times the difference between the @xmath189 and @xmath190 times finer cases , and thus our simulation converges to second order . for @xmath191 and @xmath192 ,",
    "the curves appear to diverge , since there is a singularity .",
    "however , even before the singularity , the error is @xmath193 .",
    "plots of errors with different step sizes . here , we plot @xmath194 and @xmath195 along a few constant @xmath23 lines , where @xmath196 is calculated in an @xmath197 times finer simulation than @xmath198 . since",
    "two curves are folded for each @xmath23 slice , we confirm that our simulation converges to second order . ]",
    "we also compared constraint equations ( equations  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2 ] ) ) using @xmath201 figures  [ fig : constraint_u ] and [ fig : constraint_v ] show the constraint equations . around the singularity ,",
    "the constraint equations increase , but still the value is less than @xmath202 . for figure",
    "[ fig : constraint_v ] , the constraint equation initially appears to be large , because initially both the numerator and denominator , in equation  ( [ eq : constraint_v ] ) , are too small ( less than @xmath203 ) .",
    "therefore , these plots show that our simulations hold the constraint equations sufficiently .",
