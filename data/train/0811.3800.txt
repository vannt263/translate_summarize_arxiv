    "in the new field of spintronics @xcite , the magnetic properties of quantum devices control the transport properties via the electron spin , for example , the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in ferromagnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "the high magnetoresistance in a tmr device is due to the spin - valve effect , namely , the resistance strongly depends on whether the magnetization of the two ferromagnetic electrodes are parallel or antiparallel . by switching the magnetization of one electrode with respect to the other , the charge current",

    "a pure spin current can be generated and detected experimentally .",
    "@xcite this substantial progress in experiment makes it feasible to investigate the spin transport properties in mesoscopic systems .    to study the spin - dependent transport properties ,",
    "a device setup of a quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to ferromagnetic leads has been proposed .",
    "sergueev-2002 in such a geometry , the charge current can be spin polarized and can induce a pure spin current .",
    "however , up to now , most of the previous works were devoted to the charge transport properties , not to the study of the spin current itself .",
    "moreover , the main focus was on the charge transport on a qd coupled to two ferromagnetic leads with collinear magnetizations , bulka-2003,martinek-2003,sindle-2003,choi-2003,utsumi-2005,zhang-2003 , lpez-2003,borda-2003,souza , cottet-2006,pasupathy , hamaya-2007 while less attention was given to the noncollinear alignment .",

    "@xcite gave an expression for the spin current through the left tunnel barrier .",
    "however , they did not derive an adequate unified formula for the spin current through the two tunnel barriers and did not actually consider the spin current in a steady state .",

    "unfortunately , these authors did not properly take into account the difference of the spin quantization axis for the two leads , so their result is correct only for the parallel case .",

    "@xcite studied the charge current through a quantum dot coupled to noncollinearly polarized ferromagnetic leads .",
    "they found that the current - voltage curve reveals typical step - like characteristics .",
    "they also found that the spin precession is enhanced by the coulomb correlations and strong spin polarization of the leads .",
    "moreover , the relationship between the charge current and the angle of the magnetization configurations of the electrodes has been studied by zhou _",
    "@xcite these authors concluded that the angle dependence of the electric current in the free regime varies monotonically from the parallel to antiparallel alignment , while in the coulomb blockade regime it varies nonmonotonically .",

    ", this general formula of the spin current for this class of devices is derived for the first time .",
    "it should play a similar role as its charge counterpart derived earlier .",
    "sergueev-2002,meir-1992,jauho then , by using the equation - of - motion technique with the hartree - fock decoupling scheme , the spin current is obtained as a function of the bias voltage and the angle @xmath5 of the magnetization configurations of the leads ( sec.iii ) . furthermore , the spin current and the spin tunneling magnetoresistance ( stmr ) are calculated numerically in both free and coulomb blockade regimes ( sec .",
    "the interplay of the spin precession enhanced by the coulomb repulsion and the spin valve effect gives rise to anomalous behavior of the angular dependence of the spin current anticipated in the coulomb blockade regime .",

    "it is left for our future work to discuss the influence of the kondo - like correlations on the spin transport properties of this system .",
    "now we numerically calculate the three components of the spin current .",
    "since a general magnetic configuration of the leads is considered , the spin tunneling magnetoresistance ( stmr ) can be estimated by@xmath68where @xmath69 denote the three components of the spin current . in the following three different situations",
    "are considered : a symmetric junction with fully polarized external electrodes ( @xmath70 ) , with partially polarized external electrodes ( @xmath71 ) , and an asymmetric junction ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-voltage curve for the symmetric cases reveals typical step - like characteristics .",
    "below the lower threshold voltage , the dot is empty and the sequential contribution to @xmath1 is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the first step in @xmath1 occurs at a critical bias , where the discrete level @xmath18 crosses the fermi level , whereas the step at a higher threshold corresponds to the case when @xmath73 crosses the fermi level . in the same voltage range ,",
    "@xmath1 in the case of @xmath70 is much larger , since the external electrodes are fully polarized .",
    "_ @xcite also considered this case ( @xmath74 ) , but their result is different from ours because they did not properly take into account the difference of the local quantization axes in the two leads and hence the result for the @xmath3-component of the spin current is incorrect .",
    "the case of @xmath72 is more complex ( red dashed curve in fig.1(a ) ) , as the asymmetry between the left and right electrodes gives rise to asymmetrical transport characteristics of the junction with respect to the bias reversal . for the positive bias ,",
    "@xmath1 curve is rather smooth above the first threshold voltage , while for the negative bias , below the first threshold sequential tunneling is exponentially suppressed and only the higher - order tunneling processes are possible .",
    "when @xmath18 approaches the fermi level of the left electrode , the resonant tunneling can happen .",
    "however , as the bias further increases , @xmath1 is suppressed by an electron on the qd since the electrode is partially polarized ( coulomb blockade effect ) , and a small peak appears as a result of competition between the resonance tunneling and the coulomb repulsion .",
    "after the second resonant tunneling , @xmath1 finally saturates at a certain level .",
    "the behavior of spin current component @xmath75 ( fig.2(b ) ) is similar to the component @xmath1 ( fig.2(a ) ) , because the magnetizations of the two leads are aligned in the @xmath7-@xmath3 plane .",
    "however , the asymmetry effect resulting in the appearance of a peak at the first threshold is more pronounced .",
    "it appears even for the symmetric electrodes ( @xmath76 ) , because the coulomb blockade effect already shows up .",
    "the asymmetry of the spin current curve is even more pronounced for the @xmath77 component ( fig.2(c ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the two peaks on the @xmath78 curve are exactly located at the two resonant tunneling biases .",
    "the spin current is strongly affected by the angle @xmath5 between the magnetic moments of the leads and we can use stmr to describe it . in the free regime ,",
    "where @xmath80 , the qd energy level may be occupied by two electrons , because the coulomb correlation plays a little role in the spin tunneling . as a result , @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath81 exhibit a monotonic variation between the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations , which is typical of a normal spin - valve effect . under the third condition ( @xmath72 ) ,",
    "@xmath1 can achieve a negative value .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath75 and @xmath78 achieve their maxima between @xmath82 and @xmath83 as shown in fig.3(c ) and fig.3(e ) , since the absolute values of the @xmath7 and @xmath84 components of the electron spin in the right electrode may increase when the magnetic moment of the right lead approaches the @xmath7-@xmath84 plane .      in the coulomb blockade regime @xmath93",
    ", the qd energy level can be occupied only by one electron .",
    "the coulomb interaction plays an important role in the spin current through the qd . in fig.4(a ) , it is found that @xmath94 is no longer maximal and @xmath95 is greater than @xmath94 in a wide range of @xmath5 under this condition ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is quite different from that in the free regime .",
    "the coupling between the qd and the ferromagnetic leads may induce an effective exchange field , and its strength and orientation with respect to the global quantization axis depend on the bias voltage and the angle between magnetizations of the leads .",
    "when only one electron resides on the qd energy level , the spin degrees of freedom experience a torque due to the effective exchange field , which results in precession of the spin around the field .",
    "@xcite this process would suppress @xmath1 , and the competition of the spin precession effect and the spin - valve effect leads to the anomaly of @xmath95 . as a result of the spin precession ,",
    "the signs of @xmath96 and @xmath97 are opposite to those in the free regime .      in conclusion",
    ", we have derived a general formula for the spin current through a qd coupled to ferromagnetic leads with noncollinear magnetizations , and used the formula to calculate the spin transport properties of the system .",
    "the competition of the spin precession and the spin - valve effect results in an anomaly of the angle dependence of the spin current .",
