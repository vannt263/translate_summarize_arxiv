    "@xmath10 we associate a weight @xmath11 , which can be a real or complex number or , more generally , a formal algebraic variable ; we then define the _ ( weighted ) laplacian matrix _",
    "@xmath12 for the graph @xmath0 by @xmath13 we introduce , at each vertex @xmath14 , a pair of grassmann variables @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which obey the usual rules for grassmann integration @xcite .",
    "our identities show that certain grassmann integrals over @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be interpreted as generating functions for certain classes of combinatorial objects on @xmath0 .",
    "our most general identity concerns the operators @xmath19 associated to arbitrary connected subgraphs @xmath20 of @xmath0 via the formula @xmath21 ( note that each @xmath19 is even and hence commutes with the entire grassmann algebra . )",

    "the formulae to be presented here thus express the generating functions of unrooted or rooted spanning hyperforests in a hypergraph in terms of grassmann integrals .",
    "in particular , the hypergraph generalization of ( [ eq.fourfermion.3 ] ) possesses the same @xmath1 supersymmetry that ( [ eq.fourfermion.3 ] ) does ( see section  [ sec : osp ] ) .",
    "the proof given here of all these identities is purely algebraic ( and astonishingly simple ) ; the crucial ingredient is to recognize the role and the rules of a certain grassmann subalgebra ( see section  [ sec : grass ] ) .",
    "it turns out ( section  [ sec : osp ] ) that this subalgebra is nothing other than the algebra of @xmath1-invariant functions , though this is far from obvious at first sight .",
    "the unusual properties of this subalgebra ( see lemma  [ lem.fafb ] ) thus provide a deeper insight into the identities derived in @xcite as well as their generalizations to hypergraphs , and indeed provide an alternate proof of ( [ eq.fourfermion.2])([eq.fourfermion.4 ] ) .",
    "pictorially , we can say that it is the underlying supersymmetry that is responsible for the cancellation of the cycles in the generating function , leaving only those spanning ( hyper)graphs that have no cycles , namely , the ( hyper)forests .    in particular , the limit of spanning hyper_trees _ , which is easily extracted from the general expression for ( rooted or unrooted )",
    "hyperforests , corresponds in the @xmath1-invariant @xmath2-model to the limit in which the radius of the supersphere tends to infinity , so that the nonlinearity due to the curvature of the supersphere disappears .",
    "however , the action is in general still non - quadratic , so that the model is not exactly soluble .",
    "( this is no accident : even the problem of determining whether there _ exists _ a spanning hypertree in a given hypergraph is np - complete @xcite . ) only in the special case of ordinary graphs is the action purely quadratic , so that the partition function is given by a determinant , corresponding to the statement of kirchhoff s matrix - tree theorem .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant fermionic models discussed in @xcite and the present paper can be written in three equivalent ways :    * as purely fermionic models , in which the supersymmetry is somewhat hidden . * as @xmath2-models with spins taking values in the unit supersphere in @xmath51 , in which the supersymmetry is manifest .",
    "* as @xmath52-vector models [ = @xmath53-symmetric @xmath2-models with spins taking values in the unit sphere of @xmath54 analytically continued to @xmath55 .    the first two formulations ( and their equivalence )",
    "are discussed in section  [ sec : osp ] of the present paper .",
    "further aspects of this equivalence  notably , the role played by the ising variables arising in ( [ def.sigmai ] ) and neglected here  will be discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .    in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "we will discuss the ward identities associated to the @xmath1 supersymmetry , and their relation to the combinatorial identities describing the possible connection patterns among the ( hyper)trees of a ( hyper)forest .",
    "the method proposed in the present paper has additional applications not considered here . with a small further effort , a class of grassmann integrals wider than ( [ eq.zgrass])/([eq.corrfn.grass ] ) ",
    "allowing products @xmath56 in the action in place of the single operators @xmath57  can be handled .",
    "once again one obtains a graphical expansion in terms of spanning hyperforests , where now the weights have a more complicated dependence on the set of hyperedges , thus permitting a description of certain natural interaction patterns among the hyperedges of a hyperforest ( see remark at the end of section  [ sec : integrals ] ) .",
    "this extended model is , in fact , the _",
    "most general _ hamiltonian that is invariant under the @xmath1 supersymmetry .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : graph ] we recall the basic facts about graphs and hypergraphs that will be needed in the sequel . in section  [ sec : potts ]",
    "we define the @xmath4-state potts model on a hypergraph and prove the corresponding fortuin  kasteleyn representation .",
    "( this section is unnecessary for the proof of the combinatorial identities that form the main focus of this paper , but it provides additional physical motivation . ) in section  [ sec : grass ] we introduce the grassmann algebra over the vertex set @xmath8 , and study a subalgebra with interesting and unusual properties , which is generated by a particular family of even elements @xmath57 with @xmath58 . in section  [ sec : integrals ] we study a very general partition function involving the operators @xmath57 , and we show how it can be expressed as a generating function of spanning hyperforests in a hypergraph with vertex set @xmath8 . in section  [ sec : corrfn ] we study a somewhat more general grassmann integral , which can be interpreted as a correlation function in this same grassmann model ; we show how it too can be expressed as a sum over spanning hyperforests . in section  [ sec : osp ] we show that in one special case  namely , the hypergraph generalization of ( [ eq.fourfermion.3 ] )  the model studied in the preceding sections can be rewritten as an @xmath1-invariant @xmath2-model , and indeed is the most general @xmath1-invariant hamiltonian involving @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "this is pretty much the result one would have expected , _ but _ we have an overall minus sign , irrespective of the length of the cycle ( or its parity ) , which is in a sense `` non - local '' , due to the fermionic nature of the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for this reason we call a dashed cycle a _",
    "fermionic cycle_.    a similar mechanism arises for the open paths of dashed hyperedges @xmath609 @xmath610 , where @xmath562 is the source",
    "vertex and @xmath611 is the sink vertex . here",
    "the weight @xmath612 multiplies the monomial @xmath613 , in which the only unpaired fermions are @xmath614 and @xmath615 . in this order .",
    "now the monomials for the open paths must be multiplied by @xmath616 , and each source ( resp .",
    "sink ) vertex from an open path must correspond to a vertex of @xmath553 ( resp .",
    "@xmath554 ) .",
    "this pairing thus induces a permutation of @xmath331 , where @xmath617 : namely , @xmath372 is connected by an open path to @xmath373 .",
    "we then have @xmath618 where the first product is @xmath616 and the second product comes from the open paths .",
    "this can easily be rewritten as    _",
    "r=1^k _ i_r _ j_r _ i_r _",
    "j_(r ) & = & _ r=1^k _ i_r _ i_r _ j_(r ) _ j_r + & = & ( _ r=1^k _ i_r _ i_r ) ( _ r=1^k _ j_(r ) _",
    "j_r ) + & = & ( ) ( _ r=1^k _ i_r _ i_r ) ( _ r=1^k _ j_r _ j_r ) .    putting everything together , we see that the grassmann integral ( [ eq.a1 ] ) can be represented as a sum over rooted oriented spanning subhypergraphs @xmath619 of @xmath0 , as follows :    * each connected component of @xmath602 ( the unoriented subhypergraph corresponding to @xmath619 ) is either a ( hyper-)tree or a ( hyper-)unicyclic . * each ( hyper-)tree component contains either one vertex from @xmath553 ( the _ source vertex _ ) and one from @xmath554 ( the _ sink vertex _ , which is allowed to coincide with the source vertex ) , or else no vertex from @xmath551 . in the latter case ,",
    "we choose either one vertex of the component to be the _ root vertex _ , or else one hyperedge of the component to be the _ root hyperedge_. * each unicyclic component contains no vertex from @xmath551 . as a unicyclic",
    ", it necessarily has the form of a single ( hyper-)cycle together with ( hyper-)trees ( possibly reduced to a single vertex ) rooted at the vertices of the ( hyper-)cycle . *",
    "each hyperedge other than a root hyperedge is _ oriented _ by designating a vertex @xmath620 as the _",
    "outgoing vertex_. these orientations must satisfy following rules : * * each ( hyper-)tree component is directed towards the sink vertex , root vertex or root hyperedge , * * each ( hyper-)tree belonging to a unicyclic component is oriented towards the cycle , and * * the ( hyper-)cycle of each unicyclic component is oriented consistently . + thus , in each ( hyper-)tree component the orientations are fixed uniquely , while in each unicyclic component we sum over the two consistent orientations of the cycle .",
    "the _ weight _ of a configuration @xmath619 is the product of the weights of its connected components , which are in turn defined as the product of the following factors :    * each root vertex @xmath31 gets a factor @xmath50 . *",
    "each root hyperedge @xmath102 gets a factor @xmath556 .",
    "* each hyperedge @xmath102 belonging to the ( unique ) path from a source vertex to a sink vertex gets a factor @xmath558 , where @xmath398 is the outgoing vertex of @xmath102 and @xmath31 is the outgoing vertex of the preceding hyperedge along the path ( or the source vertex if @xmath102 is the first hyperedge of the path ) .",
    "* each hyperedge @xmath102 that does not belong to a source - sink path or to a cycle gets a factor @xmath621 [ recall that @xmath622 is the outgoing vertex of @xmath102 ] . *",
    "each oriented cycle @xmath624 gets a weight @xmath625 * there is an overall factor @xmath626 .",
    "the contribution from unicyclic components cancels out whenever @xmath627 for every oriented cycle @xmath624 .",
    "in particular , this happens if @xmath628 for all @xmath102 and all @xmath339 .",
    "more generally , it happens if @xmath629 where @xmath630 has `` zero circulation '' in the sense that @xmath631 for every oriented cycle @xmath624 .",
    "physically , @xmath630 can be thought of as a kind of ",
    "gauge field to which the fermions @xmath422 are coupled ; the zero - circulation condition means that @xmath630 is gauge - equivalent to zero .",
    "note , finally , that if @xmath632 for all @xmath339 , then @xmath633 .    at the other extreme ,",
    "if we take all @xmath634 , all @xmath635 and @xmath636 , then all tree components disappear , and we are left with only unicyclics .    in certain `` symmetric '' circumstances , we can combine the contributions from tree components having the same set of ( unoriented ) hyperedges but different roots , and obtain reasonably simple expressions . in particular , suppose that the weights @xmath557 are independent of @xmath31 ( let us call them simply @xmath158 ) , and consider a tree component @xmath637 that does not contain any vertices of @xmath551 .",
    "then we can sum over all choices of root vertex or root hyperedge , and obtain the weight @xmath638 a further simplification occurs in two cases :    * if all @xmath639 and all @xmath635 , then the second factor in ( [ eq.special.sym ] ) becomes simply @xmath640 : we obtain forests of _ vertex - weighted trees_. * if all @xmath639 and @xmath641 for all @xmath102 , then the second factor in ( [ eq.special.sym ] ) becomes simply @xmath642 ( by virtue of proposition  [ prop.eulerineq.hypergraphs ] ) and we obtain _ unrooted _ forests .",
    "recall , finally , that if we also take @xmath643 for all @xmath102 and all @xmath339 , then the unicyclic components cancel and @xmath633 , so that ( [ eq.special.sym ] ) reduces to ( [ eq.thm.zgrass.gen ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the special case in which @xmath0 is an ordinary graph , i.e.  each hyperedge @xmath101 is of cardinality 2 .",
    "if we further take all @xmath644 , then the quantity in the exponential of the functional integral ( [ eq.a1 ] ) is a quadratic form @xmath645 , with matrix @xmath646 our result for @xmath636 then corresponds to the `` two - matrix matrix - tree theorem '' of moon ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) with @xmath647 for @xmath648 , @xmath649 , @xmath650 for @xmath344 and @xmath651 .. our `` transposed '' notation was chosen in order to make more natural the definitions of correlation functions in section  [ sec : corrfn ] . ]",
