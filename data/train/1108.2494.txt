    "we review the regular polytopes and hyperbolic coverings that correspond to defectless tilings of simplices on spaces of constant curvature .",
    "in particular , we aim to show the following .    1 .",
    "a regular tiling of tetrahedra is found on the sphere that inscribes the remarkably large 4d platonic polytope @xmath63 .",
    "the inscribing sphere s curvature , @xmath64 , is notably much smaller than that of the generalized octahedron @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   by contrast , on the @xmath67-dimensional sphere with @xmath62 , @xmath68 is the only way to obtain a regular tiling of simplices resulting in large geometrical frustration of the corresponding euclidean space , which hints at a possible limit role of simplex ordering in 3d .",
    "3 .   the regular simplicial tiling @xmath69 is found on a hyperbolic space of curvature larger ( in absolute value ) than the curvature of the sphere that inscribes the tiling @xmath70 , while the hyperbolic tiling @xmath71 s infinite edge length disqualifies it as a possible reference .",
    "the homogeneous statistical honeycomb @xmath72 gives is an upper limit for the density of simplex tiling in @xmath2 , and a lower limit to @xmath10 .",
    "we first establish some notation .",
    "the euclidean space of dimension @xmath67 is denoted @xmath73 and the hyperbolic space of dimension @xmath67 is denoted @xmath74 .",
    "the sphere ( or hypersphere ) of ( surface ) dimension @xmath67 is the set of all vectors of length @xmath75 in @xmath76 and is denoted @xmath77 .",
    "hence @xmath78 is the standard radius one sphere in @xmath79 we all know and love .",
    "following schlfli s notation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) , the polytope @xmath80 is composed of polytopes @xmath81 with vertex figure @xmath82 .",
    "the _ vertex figure _ of a @xmath67-dimensional polytope is a @xmath83-dimensional polytope whose vertices are obtained by taking the middle of each edge emanating from a vertex .",
    "this inductive definition deserves an illustration .",
    "the basic example is @xmath84 , the regular polygon of @xmath85 sides in @xmath86 .",
    "next we have the regular polytopes in @xmath79 .",
    "those are represented by the symbols @xmath87 for a polytope having faces made of @xmath84s and vertex figures made of @xmath88s .",
    "note that because the polytope is regular , one can inscribe all the vertices on a sphere and thus @xmath87 gives a tiling of the sphere @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , the cube @xmath89 is composed of squares ( the regular polygon @xmath90 ) and the vertex figure is @xmath91 , a triangle .",
    "the cubic tiling @xmath92 in @xmath86 is composed of 4 squares surrounding each vertex . throughout the text",
    ", we use a measure @xmath93 of the number of tetrahedra sharing a particular edge between nearest - neighbor pairs and @xmath94 for the average amongst all pairs of nearest - neighbor .",
    "this quantity generalizes to higher - dimensional setting in the following manner : in a @xmath67-dimensional space ( be it @xmath95 or @xmath74 ) , a set of @xmath96 points all nearest - neighbors to each other form a @xmath97-simplex ( generalized tetrahedron ) .",
    "a @xmath75-simplex is a line segment , a @xmath98-simplex is a tetrahedron , etc . as in three - dimensional system ,",
    "the dimension @xmath99-simplices play an important role .",
    "we call them _",
    "spindles_. given a particular @xmath99-simplex , we let @xmath93 measure the number of @xmath67-simplexes that contain it .",
    "obviously , @xmath94 is the average of @xmath93 over all spindles .      of primary importance for this paper",
    "is the relation between schlfli s notation and the number @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath80 be a regular tiling in @xmath73 or @xmath77 .",
    "one can show that @xmath100 . instead of exhibiting the proof of this result , we give an example .",
    "consider the simple cubic tiling of @xmath73 , given by @xmath101 . here , a @xmath99-dimensional hypercube is given , for example , by @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "the various @xmath67-dimensional hypercubes containing this @xmath99-dimensional hypercube are given by @xmath105 $ ] , where the signs are chosen independently .",
    "hence @xmath106 .",
    "note that any polytope @xmath80 in @xmath76 can be seen as inscribed in a sphere @xmath77 whose center is the center of mass of the polytope . by inflating the polytope to make it round",
    ", we see that it produces a regular tiling of @xmath77 . for instance , the hypercube @xmath107 in @xmath108 is also a tiling of @xmath109 . by looking at the usual case @xmath89 , one sees that it gives @xmath110 on @xmath78 .",
    "the same argument illustrates that for the tiling @xmath111 of @xmath112 , one also has @xmath110 .",
    "consider the case of the generalized octahedron , @xmath68 , in @xmath76 .",
    "it gives a regular tiling of @xmath77 with @xmath106 .",
    "this tiling is dual in @xmath76 to @xmath111 which can be thought as the cube @xmath113^{d+1}$ ] .",
    "so the vertices of the dual generalized octahedron are @xmath114 for the standard basis @xmath115 of @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , the distance between two vertices is @xmath116 via straight line , or @xmath117 in @xmath77 . to obtain a unit distance in @xmath77 ,",
    "one has to rescale the sphere to be of radius @xmath118 , hence the sphere has a curvature @xmath119 .",
    "as pointed by @xcite , the 120 vertices of the 600-cell @xmath63 all belong to the hypersphere @xmath120 with radius equal to the golden ratio ( @xmath121 ) if the edges are of unit length .",
    "the alternative expression @xmath122 is useful for our computation .",
    "indeed , imagine a isosceles triangle whose equal sides measure @xmath47 and opposite side measure 1 .",
    "the angle opposite to the side of measure 1 is @xmath123 so , if one desires the spherical distance between vertices in the @xmath63 regular tiling of @xmath120 to be 1 , the radius must be @xmath124 .",
    "the curvature of this sphere is thus @xmath125 .",
    "the tiling @xmath71 in hyperbolic 3-space @xmath126 is somewhat of a degenerate case . despite the cells being of finite volume , all of its vertices are at infinity hence the edge length is infinite , which makes the curvature impossible to rescale ;",
    "see @xcite . in @xmath127",
    "however , the tiling @xmath128 is perfectly well - defined , with finite distance between vertices . according to (",
    "* and table p.213 ) , the edge - length is @xmath129 and @xmath130 , hence the edge - length is @xmath131 .",
    "the expressions obtained by coxeter are consistent with the results in standard hyperbolic space of curvature @xmath132 . rescaling the space to make the edge - length 1 changes the curvature to @xmath133 .    still following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) , one sees that the regular tilings in @xmath134 are not tetrahedral and that there are no regular tilings in hyperbolic space of six or more dimensions . in @xmath135 ,",
    "any @xmath136 with @xmath137 is possible , with edge - length @xmath129 where @xmath138 ; @xcite . rescaling to get edge - length @xmath75 , one gets a curvature @xmath139 .    the results for @xmath140 are summarized in table  [ table : summary ] .",
    "note that in the @xmath135 case , the packing of an increasing number of hyperbolic triangles around a vertex , keeping the edge - length 1 , makes the curvature go down from approximately @xmath141 ( for @xmath142 ) , to @xmath143 ( for @xmath144 ) , to @xmath145 ( for @xmath146 ) , with limit @xmath147 as @xmath148 .",
    "coxeter suggested that nature tries to approximate regular tilings @xmath150 for @xmath85 between 5 and 6 in soap froth  ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "obviously , the soap froth itself produces an irregular tiling , but one could look at the average structure , the _",
    "statistical honeycomb_. taking its dual , as suggested by @xcite , we consider the corresponding statistical honeycomb @xmath151 produced by wrapping as many tetrahedra as possible around a given spindle , even if that means wrapping a fraction of a tetrahedron . because the angle formed by two adjacent edges in a perfectly regular tetrahedron is @xmath152 , the ideal number is thus @xmath153 .    as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can consider an ideal configuration where every bond belongs to @xmath94 tetrahedra . in the voronoi decomposition corresponding to this configuration ,",
    "the cells have @xmath154 identical faces corresponding to the @xmath154 nearest neighbors of a particle , each of them being a polygon with @xmath94 faces .",
    "this voronoi cell can be seen as living on the surface of a sphere . if it has @xmath155 vertices and @xmath156 edges , we must thus have @xmath157 , using euler s relation . counting the pairs ( _ edge_,_face _ ) , with _ edge _ adjacent to _ face _ , in two different ways , we get @xmath158 , and counting the pairs ( _ edge_,_vertex _ ) in two different ways , we get @xmath159 .",
    "overall , we obtain that in this ideal structure , each particle has a number of neighbors @xmath160 note that in this construction , all quantities are also by definition their own average",
    ".    now one can compute the volume occupied by that fictitious voronoi cell , and obtain , as did ref .",
    "@xcite , a volume of @xmath161 the packing fraction is then given by @xmath162 it should be noted that this result is also roger s bound on the maximal packing fraction for any sphere packing in 3d , not only simplex tilings . in all cases , it gives an upper bound on the density of simplex tilings in 3d systems ."

    "<S> second , although in curved space the optimal number of simplices per bond can be as low as @xmath5 , in euclidean space a more stringent limit @xmath12 is obtained from the fictitious `` statistical honeycomb '' construction  @xcite . figure  [ fig : spindles ] shows that both densifying fluids present a growing polytetrahedral character . the average spindle coordination decreases , seemingly toward its optimal value , with increasing packing fraction @xmath13 for both models , as does its distribution @xmath6 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the saturation length corresponding to the maximal spatial extension of simplex order estimated from the radius of sphere inscribing the gently curved space from which this argument derives is @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is obtained by pinning a random selection of particles from an equilibrated fluid configuration , and measuring the overlap between the initial and final configurations after a long time @xmath30 has elapsed , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the occupancy of a spatial cubic cell whose volume is similar to that of the smaller particles in the system in order to prevent multiple occupancy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subtracting the random overlap contribution @xmath33 leaves a quantity that grows from low to high as the pinning concentration @xmath34 increases ( fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : lengths ] shows that the penetration length @xmath36 increases only very modestly over the dynamically accessible density range . </S>",
    "<S> for sake of comparison , we display in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : lengths ] an estimate of @xmath38 evaluated from the pair correlation function @xmath41 , which , as is well known , changes only slightly with density . </S>",
    "<S> the penetration length increases only about @xmath42 more than @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> ( artificially breaking down structural order into radial and orientational contributions suggests that the latter is at most comparable to the former over the density range studied , further supporting the spindle analysis . ) note that in view of the small variation of all the static lengths , @xmath17 , @xmath23 , @xmath38 and @xmath28 , trying to devise a crisper measuring procedure is unnecessary as it will not qualitatively alter the conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the `` dynamic length '' @xmath43 characterizing the spatial correlations in the dynamics and associated with dynamical heterogeneities grows markedly over the same density range . whereas the change in the static length is measured in fractions of their low - density value </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath43 grows by a factor of almost @xmath44 when reaching @xmath45  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusivity @xmath46 and the structural relaxation time @xmath47 meanwhile change by about 4 orders of magnitude ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lengths ] ) .    although the above results may come as no surprise to those who believe the dynamical slowdown to be a purely kinetic phenomenon involving no growing static length scale , it is nonetheless worth checking whether one does not violate the bound between relaxation time and static correlation length put forward by montanari and semerjian  @xcite , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a constant setting the microscopic time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath50 depends on density ( or temperature for a glass - forming liquid ) and is such that when @xmath51 the right - hand side describes the `` noncooperative dynamics '' of the model  @xcite . using an arrhenius - like argument for activation volumes  @xcite , we note that , all else being equal , higher pressures trivially rescale the free - energy landscape and thereby slow the dynamics . for a hard - sphere fluid , one then expects @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the pressure . it should be stressed that the upper bound of @xmath47 diverges with the pressure even in the absence of any growing @xmath29 , as when approaching @xmath54 for an arrhenius temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> in the low and moderate density fluid , the relaxation time indeed follows @xmath55 $ ] with @xmath56 a density - independent constant . </S>",
    "<S> one then finds that @xmath57}{\\log[\\tau_{\\rm low}(\\phi)/\\tau_0]}\\right)^{1/3 } \\lesssim   \\frac{\\xi_{\\rm ps}(\\phi)}{\\xi_{\\rm ps,0}},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the low - density limit of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq_bound - length ] ) thus provides a lower bound for the growth of a static length imposed by the dynamical slowdown .    to assess whether the above bound is satisfied or not , one needs an estimate of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the direct approach would be to consider the effect of pinning the boundary of a spherical cavity on the fluid inside , but one may reasonably expect that the penetration length studied above gives a rough estimate of @xmath29 . near a random - first - order transition or near any first - order transition @xmath59  @xcite , but </S>",
    "<S> far from such transitions , which is the case studied here , one expects @xmath60 . in any case , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lengths ] , the bound given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_bound - length ] ) increases only slowly in the dynamically accessible domain and is already satisfied by @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this moderate growth of the bound further illustrates that hard spheres are not in fact very `` fragile '' in the regime up to @xmath45 , showing only a limited deviation with respect to the low - density behavior , which is in line with what is found for other simple fluids , such as the lennard - jones glass - forming liquids  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations may well correlate with the fact that most 3d fluids of spherical particles are strongly frustrated in the sense discussed above .    </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the growth of a static length is not the controlling factor behind the relaxation slowdown in the range of density considered . </S>",
    "<S> this finding points to a mechanism for the slowdown that is either essentially `` noncooperative '' , or akin to that predicted by the mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite ; in both cases , the growth of a dynamic length is not accompanied by that of a static length . </S>",
    "<S> we can not , however , draw any general conclusion on this question beyond this regime . in thermodynamic - based theories  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it is at these higher densities ( or lower temperatures for a liquid ) where cooperative behavior becomes dominant , and the dynamical slowdown is predominantly controlled by the growth of a static length . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is unfortunately mostly beyond present - day computer resources  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a modest indication that a crossover takes place may , however , be given by the data for @xmath61 and the bound , which both appear to display a steeper increase near @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have first shown that 3d hard spheres , like @xmath62 hard spheres and many 3d simple glass formers , are too strongly frustrated for the dual picture in terms of defects  @xcite to bring any useful simplification . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder if there exist other liquids with a different type of locally preferred order for which frustration is weaker and the picture can be put to work . whereas this frustration regime can be achieved in 2d by curving space  @xcite , no such clear - cut example of simulation - accessible glass formers in 3d euclidean space has yet been devised . </S>",
    "<S> second , we have shown that within the regime accessed here static lengths grow very slowly , yet in a way that is compatible with the bound recently put forward between relaxation time and static length . for systems similar to hard spheres , these results severely constrain the type of ordering that can develop and place serious doubts on the pertinence of local - order analysis in the moderately viscous dynamical regime . the dynamic length s significant increase points instead to a decoupling between the increasingly heterogeneous character of the dynamics and its cooperative origin in terms of structural or thermodynamic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> a challenge would be to search for a possible crossover at still higher densities .    </S>",
