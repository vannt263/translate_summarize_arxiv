    "the most interesting features of perfect metallic magnetic multilayer are the oscillatory behavior of bilinear exchange coupling energy between ferromagnets @xcite due to friedel oscillations , and large magnetoresistance in small magnetic fields @xcite .    the magnetic structure of adjoining magnetic layers in perfect multilayered structure oscillates between ferro and antiferro - magnetic states with increasing the spacer thickness @xmath1 . disorder in layers contributes to biquadratic exchange coupling .",
    "it was shown that fluctuations of thickness of the paramagnetic layer give rise to biquadratic exchange coupling , often leading to non - collinear magnetic ordering @xcite . in ref .",
    "the role of scattering of conducting electrons by impurities in metallic magnetic multilayer was studied .",
    "it was pointed out that in the case of small ( compared to thickness of the layers ) mean free path of conducting electrons , when average friedel oscillations are exponentially suppressed , the exchange coupling energy due to random friedel oscillations and correlation effects can have biquadratic form .",
    "transition to the non - collinear phase in disordered structure with increasing @xmath1 was experimentally observed in ref .  .",
    "it is established that the magnetoresistance of perfect metallic magnetic multilayered structure is related to spin - depended scattering of conducting electrons at the interfaces between the layers @xcite . in the case of disorder ,",
    "scattering of conducting electrons by impurities suppresses the effect of spin - dependent scattering on magnetoresistance .",
    "moreover , it was theoretically shown that the magnitude of the magnetoresistance decreases exponentially in the case of the current - in - plane ( cip ) geometry , when thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer exceeds the mean free path of conducting electrons @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the effect of electron - electron interactions on cip conductivity and exchange coupling energy of disordered metallic multilayered structure consisting of two ferromagnetic layers with paramagnetic spacer .",
    "we consider the case when mean free path of conducting electrons is smaller than thicknesses of layers .",
    "it is known that in the disordered conductors electron - electron interactions result in anomalous contributions to conductivity , thermodynamic quantities and negative magnetoconductivity @xcite .",
    "physics behind the effect of electron - electron interactions in disordered conductors is the electron scattering by the random friedel oscillations @xcite .",
    "freidel oscillations in magnetic multilayered structure do depend on the angle @xmath2 between directions of magnetization in magnetic layers .",
    "the study of this dependence is the subject of this paper .",
    "the scattering by freidel oscillations exists in any type of ferromagnetic structure : itinerant ( _ d- _ type ) or localized ( _ f- _ type ) . in what follows , the most relevant factors of disordered magnetic multilayered structure are the characteristic of the disorder - the thouless energy @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the conducting electron diffusion constant ) , and ferromagnetic splitting of conducting electrons . because of that we consider the model of localized _ s - f _ magnetism that contains these parameters in the most transparent way .",
    "we propose that each ferromagnetic layer is described by the homogeneous magnetization , and that directions of magnetizations of different layers make an angle @xmath2 .",
    "the conductivity and exchange coupling energy in magnetic multilayered structure are periodic functions of @xmath2 .",
    "we show that depending on the ratio of introduced above characteristic energies , the angle @xmath2 dependent contributions of electron - electron interactions experience the @xmath5 periodicity transition .",
    "magnitudes of contributions are estimated .",
    "we suppose that our results might be relevant to the series of works related to transport properties of mesoscopic ferromagnets with domain walls , where it was experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite shown that effects of electron interactions and weak localization are important .",
    "we would like to mention that results of this paper complement the theory of electron - electron interactions in disorders conductors @xcite as a study of effect of electron - electron interactions in spatially inhomogeneous effective magnetic field that is imposed by the magnetization in layers .",
    "the system of our study is disordered metallic magnetic multilayer structure .",
    "it consists of two ferromagnetic layers of the @xmath6-type located at @xmath7 and a paramagnetic layer between ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of conducting electrons of this system is : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the hamiltonian of free electrons in a random field @xmath11 . treating scattering of free electrons we use the standard diagram technique @xcite , which assumes @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the density of states at the fermi level per one spin , @xmath15 is the electron mean free time , and we have set @xmath16 .",
    "we assume the hamiltonian of free electrons to be the same in every layer .    the second term @xmath17 is the hamiltonian of the coulomb interaction between conducting electrons .",
    "@xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron creation and annihilation operators correspondingly .",
    "we will treat coulomb interaction within the random phase approximation .",
    "the third term @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of @xmath22 exchange in the ferromagnetic layers . at temperatures much lower than the curie temperature",
    "one might neglect electron - magnon interaction , therefore @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a spin of localized @xmath6-electrons , @xmath25 is their density .",

    "@xmath27 is the ferromagnetic layer magnetization direction unit vector .",
    "integration here is over the ferromagnetic layers .    neglecting the contribution of electron - magnon interaction to the conductivity and exchange coupling energy , we assume that the coulomb energy per electron is larger than the ferromagnetic splitting @xmath28 .",
    "finally we consider the following hamiltonian of a disordered metallic magnetic multilayer : @xmath29 this hamiltonian describes a fermi liquid in an effective inhomogeneous magnetic field that acts only on electron spin .",
    "this magnetic field results in the spin splitting with energy @xmath30 in the ferromagnetic layers , and in zero splitting in the paramagnetic layer .",
    "direction of this magnetic field is defined by the ferromagnetic layer magnetization direction unit vector @xmath31 : @xmath32at @xmath33 and @xmath34at @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "now we are ready to study the effect of electron interaction on the cip conductivity and exchange coupling energy between the ferromagnetic layers",
    ". we will be interested in its dependence on the angle between the direction of magnetization @xmath2 , ferromagnetic splitting energy @xmath37 , and paramagnetic thickness @xmath1 .",
    "we use kubo linear response formalism in order to study the effect of electron interaction on conductivity . treating electron interaction as a perturbation ,",
    "we come up with corrections to conventional drude formula for conductivity .",
    "we study only the first order perturbation correction .",
    "the magnetic field dependent , or in our case magnetization dependent , correction to conductivity comes from the interaction between two electrons in the triplet state ( so - called the hartree - type correction ) @xcite .",
    "disorder averaged correction can be described with the help of a feynman diagram , shown in the fig .",
    "black squares in the figure stand for the diffusion ladder that represents electrons charge and spin densities propogation .",
    "calculations of presented diagrams for the homogeneous magnetic field are carried out in ref .  .",
    "we make use of the bilinear representation of the diffusion ladder in order to calculate these diagrams for inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "our calculations show that in the case of the cip geometry all diffusion ladder combinations that appear in the figure can be simplified in to the following expression : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron interaction constant that is discussed in ref .  .",

    "it is convenient to consider conductance @xmath43 as a sum over the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic layers .",
    "contribution to the multilayer thermodynamic potential , which depends on the relative orientation of the ferromagnetic magnetizations , is also due to interaction between two electrons in the triplet state .",
    "this correction is presented in the fig . @xmath44 and given by an expression @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath47 is the area of the system .",
    "the angle - dependent part of @xmath48 determines exchange coupling energy of adjoint ferromagnetic layers .",

    "we assume it to be the same in every layer .",
    "we notice that in expressions ( [ cip ] ) and ( [ coupling ] ) only trace of the diffusion ladder appears .",

    "correction to conductance is of the order of percents of @xmath104 .",
    "in the present paper we have considered properties of a disordered magnetic metallic multilayer in the case of small electron mean free path compared to paramagnetic layer thickness .",
