    "this is a curious feature of measurement processes in quantum mechanics .",
    "such a character is actively used in measurement - based methods for quantum engineering ( e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "a general ( or weak ) measurement is associated with a positive - operator valued measure ( povm)@xcite . a povm on a measured quantum system can be expressed as a projection - valued measure in an extended system including the target system and an ancillary ( or probe ) system , as seen in , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we may construct arbitrary measurements from von neumann measurements on the extended system .",
    "however , this statement does not give a specific and simple recipe to design measurement operators .",

    "these method are simple and could be implementable in experiments .",
    "in addition , in sec.[sec : sss ] , we study how a general measurement can be implemented in solid - state qubits .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary of the ideas and the results .",
    "let us consider a linear optical system with @xmath0 input and @xmath0 output modes .",
    "the following arguments are also applicable to other physical systems such as neutron interferometers@xcite .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operator in the @xmath1th input mode is defined as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 .",
    "the vacuum @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 .",
    "the bosonic canonical commutation relations are @xmath7=\\delta_{nm } $ ] and @xmath8 = [ { \\hat{a}}_{{\\rm in},m}^{\\dagger},{\\hat{a}}_{{\\rm in},n}^{\\dagger } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "similarly , we define the annihilation ( creation ) operator in the @xmath1th output mode as @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a single photon with arbitrary polarization enters the system from the first input mode .",
    "the polarization is described by a vector @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the input state is a pure state @xmath13 . in this",
    "setting , the photon polarization is measured , using the path degree of freedom in the interferometer as an ancillary qubit .",
    "we note that the arguments in this section can be straightforwardly extended to the case of a mixed initial state of polarization .",
    "we calculate the photon state at each output mode .",
    "the field operators at the output modes are related to the input modes via a linear canonical transformation@xcite because the system is composed of linear optical elements ( e.g. , beam splitters ) .",
    "the polarization of the photon at the @xmath1th output mode is described by @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we find that in terms of the output mode operators the photon state is written as @xmath15 . since we assume that there is no photon loss , we have @xmath16 .",
    "the linearity of the system indicates that there exist linear operators @xmath17 on @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath20 implies that @xmath21 , where the identity operator on @xmath18 is @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we find that the initial state @xmath23 is transformed by a linear operator which is related with an element of a povm .",
    "it is convenient for designing various kinds of povm to add another linear optical system to some of the output modes in the interferometer before the photon detection .",
    "for example , let us set wave plates in each output mode .",
    "the wave plates in the @xmath1th mode describe a unitary gate @xmath24 given as the unitary part of @xmath17 .",
    "using the right - polar decomposition@xcite , we find that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a positive operator .",
    "the role of the wave plates is to remove the effect of the unitary evolution @xmath27 from @xmath17 .",
    "using the application of such `` path - dependent '' unitary operators , we find that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath30 satisfy @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we have the measurements corresponding to the povm @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the positive operator @xmath30 is the essential part ( i.e. , the back - action associated with the measurement ) of non - unitarity of @xmath17 and called minimally - disturbing measurement , following ref.@xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we will focus on such minimally - disturbing measurements .",
    "let us characterize the measurement operators @xmath30 .",
    "we can expand @xmath30 as @xmath34 , with the eigenvalues @xmath35 and the associated eigenvectors @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalues are related to the measurement strength , while the eigenvectors are regarded as the measurement direction .",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for example .",
    "we find that @xmath30 is a projection operator ( i.e. , a sharp measurement ) in the direction of @xmath39 , where @xmath39 is the bloch vector corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "the indistinguishability between the elements of a povm is characterized by the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the elements of a projection - valued measure are distinguishable ( i.e. , the inner products are zero ) , for example .",
    "now , we pose the question : how are these measurement features controlled by typical linear optical devices ?",

    "a single photon with arbitrary polarization ( described by @xmath23 ) enters a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "next , the polarization is transformed by a wave plate ( wp ) in each arm .",
    "then , the two arms are recombined in a beam splitter ( bs ) . after performing unitary gates @xmath44 and @xmath45 for compensation purposes ,",
    "the resultant polarization states are expressed in terms of the measurement operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 given in eqs.([eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.45 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) for the measurement strength @xmath48 ( red solid ) , @xmath49 ( blue dashed ) , and @xmath50 ( magenta dotted ) .",

    ", the interferometer for a symmetric arbitrary - strength two - outcome measurement followed by a beam splitter leads to general two - outcome measurements . the final box leading to @xmath56 after the last beam splitter represents a unitary gate for compensation purposes . depending on system s parameters ,",
    "this unitary gate becomes either a phase - shift gate or the identity operator ( i.e. , does nothing ) . in ( b ) , the repeated application of general two - outcome measurements ( gtom ) allows the construction of a povm with multiple outcomes.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "let us first define a special class of general measurements , which is the target operation in this subsection .",
    "we consider a symmetric two - outcome povm in @xmath18 composed of convex combinations of two orthogonal projection operators @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "adjusting a real parameter @xmath60 allows arbitrary measurement strength .",
    "we find that if the coefficient for @xmath61 increases , then the one for @xmath62 decreases , and vice versa .",
    "thus , these measurement operators are symmetric or balanced with respect to the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "we call the measurements described by these linear operators symmetric arbitrary - strength two - outcome measurments ( sastom ) on @xmath18 .",
    "the disturbance induced by a sastom is considered to be minimum , as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "another important property of a sastom is @xmath63 .",
    "an application of a sastom to quantum protocols is shown in , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "now , we propose a systematic way to construct this measurement .",
    "let us consider an interferometer with two input and two output modes , as shown in fig.[fig : diagram1 ] .",
    "a single photon enters a polarizing beam splitter@xcite from the first input mode .",
    "subsequently , its polarization at each arm is transformed by wave plates .",
    "then , the two modes are recombined in a beam splitter .",
    "this system is essentially the same as in ref.@xcite .",
    "we reformulate the construction manner of a sastom in ref.@xcite and extend it to make more general types of measurements . unlike the proposal in ref.@xcite , our proposals use beam splitters with tunable reflection coefficients .",
    "let us apply the basic idea in sec.[sec : general ] to this interferometer .",
    "we need three kinds of field operators for describing the path degrees of freedom , i.e. , input , intermediate , and output field operators , as shown in fig.[fig : diagram1 ] .",
    "we have an initial pure state @xmath64 with the horizontal polarization state @xmath65 and the vertical polarization state @xmath66 .",
    "the field operators @xmath43 and @xmath67 at the output modes of the polarizing beam splitter are related to @xmath2 and @xmath3 via @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71@xcite , where @xmath72 , etc .",
    "after the single photon passes through the polarizing beam splitter , we find that the photon state is written as @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we remark that the polarizing beam splitter produces entanglement between the polarization and the path degrees of freedom in the interferometer .",
    "next , we perform unitary operations for the polarization on each of these intermediate modes with the wave plates .",
    "the use of half- and quarter - wave plates allows the construction of arbitrary elements of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "hence , using the path - dependent wave plates , we find that @xmath77 with @xmath78 . the canonical transformation associated with the beam splitter@xcite is @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "after the single photon passes through the beam splitter , we find that the photon state is expressed by @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "we find that the linear operators satisfying @xmath19 are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the positive operators associated with @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given , respectively , by eqs.([eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) with @xmath90 the definition of @xmath91 implies that the choice of the unitary gates @xmath92 and @xmath93 is not unique for constructing the measurement operators @xmath30 .",
    "for example , one can set @xmath92 as the identity operator and still obtain any desired value of @xmath91 by adjusting @xmath93 .",

    "the expression for @xmath111 such that @xmath112 is calculated straightforwardly . after the applications of @xmath111",
    ", we find that @xmath113 the tunable parameter @xmath60 is the measurement strength and completely determines the indistinguishability between the povm elements , @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we have shown that the interferometer drawn in fig.[fig : diagram1 ] is a measurement apparatus for performing a sastom .",
    "let us show how the sastom can be adjusted via the linear optical elements .",
    "the interferometer contains three independent control parameters : the reflection coefficient @xmath51 , the modulus of @xmath91 , and the phase of @xmath91 .",
    "the latter two parameters are related to the wave plates .",
    "the measurement direction is characterized by the bloch vector @xmath115 . for the calculation of the bloch vector",
    "the pauli matrices are defined as @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . since the azimuthal angle @xmath119 is equal to the phase of @xmath91 , this quantity is controlled at will via phase - shift gates .",
    "the polar angle @xmath52 and the measurement strength @xmath60 are functions of @xmath51 and @xmath95 .",
    "we can find that @xmath120 and @xmath58 when changing @xmath51 and @xmath95 independently .",
    "we evaluate @xmath52 as a function of @xmath51 and @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : rc_theta ] shows that we can take an arbitrary measurement direction for given @xmath60 .",
    "the comparison to the method in ref.@xcite is useful for understanding our proposal for a sastom .",
    "let us consider the case when the beam splitter is a @xmath54 beam splitter ( @xmath121 ) and the unitary operators for the wave plates are @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we find that @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the measurement direction is fixed , and it is characterized by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "in fact , all curves in fig.[fig : rc_theta ] merge at @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the only tunable parameter in ref.@xcite is @xmath95 .",
    "two additional real parameters are necessary for controlling the measurement direction of a sastom on a single qubit . for this purpose",
    ", our proposal uses the tunable reflection coefficient in the beam splitter and the phase of @xmath91 .",
    "alternatively , the measurement direction can be controlled by using additional wave plates ( i.e. , a unitary operator ) before the polarizing beam splitter .",
    "various quantum protocols with measurement operators not expressed by eqs.([eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) have been proposed ( e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . in the remaining parts of this section",
    ", we extend the approach developed in sec.[subsec : sas ] for implementing such general measurements .",
    "two generalization routes may exist .",
    "one involves increasing the number of parameters characterizing the two measurement operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the other is to increase the number of outcomes .",
    "first , we examine the former .",
    "the eigenvalues of the measurement operators ( [ eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) are parametrized by @xmath60 .",
    "the measurement direction contains the two parameters @xmath52 and @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the number of parameters in the measurement operators is equal to a density matrix on @xmath18 .",
    "this point is also confirmed by the fact that @xmath130 .",
    "since the positive operator @xmath131 is a density matrix on @xmath18 , its square root @xmath30 is characterized by three real parameters .",
    "we consider the interferometer shown in fig.[fig : diagram2](a ) .",
    "the main difference with fig.[fig : diagram1 ] is that the present system has an additional beam splitter with reflection coefficient @xmath132 and transmission coefficient @xmath133 .",
    "accordingly , we need four kinds of field operators for describing the path degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculations before the last beam splitter are the same as in sec.[subsec : sas ] .",
    "namely , the first polarizing beam splitter creates entanglement between the polarization and the path degree of freedom .",
    "the subsequent wave plates transform photon s polarization through unitary operators depending on the path degree of freedom .",
    "the corresponding unitary operator @xmath134 is an arbitrary element of @xmath76 , as seen in sec.[subsec : sas ] .",
    "then , the two paths are recombined in the intermediate beam splitter with reflection coefficient @xmath51 . at this point ,",
    "the polarization state in the @xmath1th mode is described by @xmath135 . after the photon passes through this intermediate beam splitter , the unitary operators @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 are applied to the first and the second paths , respectively , in order to remove the unitary parts of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "these unitary operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 are automatically determined when calculating the right - polar decompositions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the resultant state in the @xmath1th mode becomes @xmath136 , as seen in eqs.([eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) .",
    "as shown in sec.[subsec : sas ] , in this step , we have three tunable parameters , i.e. , @xmath51 , the modulus of @xmath91 , and the phase of @xmath91 , where @xmath137 .",
    "let us now consider what happens in the additional part .",
    "we write the input ( output ) field operators in the last beam splitter as @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) .",
    "the related linear canonical transformations is @xmath142 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "after the photon passes through the last beam splitter , its state is written as @xmath146 , where @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "in other words , we find that    @xmath149    where @xmath60 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are given in eqs.([eq : def_eps ] ) , ( [ eq : def_mplus ] ) , and ( [ eq : def_mminus ] ) , respectively .",
    "the positive - operator parts of @xmath150 and @xmath151 are , respectively , @xmath152 the measurement direction is the same as the sastom in the previous subsection .",
    "this means that the basis vectors @xmath97 and @xmath98 do not depend on the parameter @xmath132 .",

    "can show that when @xmath157 the unitary operator @xmath158 is a phase - shift gate ( i.e. , @xmath159 ) . otherwise , @xmath158 is equal to the identity operator , up to an overall phase .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath160 and @xmath154 are characterized by two independent positive parameters @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "in contrast to a sastom , the trace of @xmath164 is not fixed .",
    "we find that @xmath165 and @xmath166 , with @xmath167 .",
    "the indistinguishability between the elements of the corresponding povm is @xmath168 , where @xmath169 .",
    "we stress that all of the features in the measurement operators are tunable via the basic linear optical elements .",
    "we also remark that the action of eqs.([eq : def_gwm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_gwm2 ] ) can be obtained by a polarizing beam splitter with tunable reflection coefficients , which has been used for implementing general two - outcome measurements in optical setups@xcite .",

    "then , we find that the state @xmath23 is transformed by the positive operator part of @xmath17 . using the right - polar decomposition , we obtain the positive operator parts of @xmath222 and @xmath88 , respectively , @xmath223 where @xmath224/2 } $ ] .",
    "general measurements with multiple outcomes can be implemented in a similar manner to that given in sec.[subsec : gwmmo ] .",
    "if we obtain the result @xmath225 in the ancillary qubit , we do nothing .",
    "a measurement operator [ i.e. , @xmath226 in eq.([eq : def_nout1 ] ) ] is applied to @xmath23 .",
    "otherwise we perform a single - qubit operation on the measured qubit to change the measurement direction and prepare a new superposition state in the ancillary qubit . then",
    ", we apply a partial controlled - not gate to the two qubits again . depending on the readout results of the ancillary qubit , we either obtain one element in the desired povm [ i.e. , @xmath227 in eq.([eq : def_nout ] ) ] or continue to the next step . repeating this procedure",
    ", we can obtain any povm with multiple outcomes .",
    "compared to linear optical qubits , the implementation of a general multi - outcome measurement in superconducting qubits has an advantage with respect to scalability .",
    "in linear optical qubits , it is necessary for the implementation of a general multi - outcome measurement to prepare all the optical elements corresponding to all the possible outcomes before the measurement .",
    "when the number of the outcomes is large , the setup become large and complicated .",
    "in addition , most of the elements in the measurement apparatus are irrelevant to the state in any single run . for example , if one obtains the outcome corresponding to @xmath228 , the remaining parts of the measurement apparatus are not used . in superconducting qubits ,",
    "the ancillary qubit can be used in the different steps of the measurement process .",
    "in contrast to linear optical setups , the total system is a two - qubit system even if the number of outcomes is large .",
    "we have proposed methods for implementing general measurements on a single qubit in linear optical and solid - state qubits .",
    "we focused on three types of general measurements on @xmath18 .",
    "the first type is the sastom described by eqs.([eq : def_elm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_elm2 ] ) .",
    "their associated povm is regarded as a minimal extension of a projection - valued measure .",
    "the second one is the general two - outcome measurements described by eqs.([eq : def_gwm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : def_gwm2 ] ) .",
    "this is the most general form of the measurements with two outcomes on @xmath18 .",
    "these two kinds of measurements have only two outcomes .",
    "finally , we found that the recursive construction given in eq.([eq : def_nout ] ) with general two - outcome measurements allows the design of general @xmath0-outcome measurements .",
    "the studies on measurement in quantum mechanics provide an interesting research field for both fundamental physics and applications .",
