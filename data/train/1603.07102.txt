    "the theory of brownian motion and random walks represents a cornerstone of statistical mechanics for providing an underlying physical picture and a microscopic explanation of many diffusion processes .",
    "the most famous examples are probably those provided by the theory of brownian motion of einstein  @xcite and smoluchowski  @xcite . since then the application range of random walk theory has widened in many different fields , extending to e.g. biology , ecology , and anthropology . the standard drift - diffusion equation , @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the particle position vector , defines the dynamics of the brownian particle through the drift velocity field @xmath3 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "in principle @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be derived from the knowledge of the microscopic dynamics of the underlying random motion . in the well known problem of the overdamped brownian motion the velocity field turns out to be given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the friction coefficient , @xmath7 the external force acting on the brownian particle , and @xmath8 the corresponding external potential .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and the friction coefficient @xmath6 are related to each other and to the temperature @xmath9 of the environment through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "besides the mentioned works by einstein  @xcite and smoluchowski  @xcite various derivations of the drift - diffusion equation have been proposed , starting from a microscopic picture of the corresponding random walk : the interpretation of the parameters in the resulting drift - diffusion equation depends on the specific problem under study  see also van kampen s derivation of the diffusion equation from a general discrete one - step processes  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since their very beginning diffusion problems have been appearing in very different disciplines , as exemplified by the first random walk model introduced in the social sciences by louis bachelier in 1900 with the goal of modeling asset price dynamics  @xcite .    in many diffusion problems the underlying dynamics of the random walkers is intrinsically different from that of a brownian particle . in place of an actual drift force , one often finds an `` attractiveness function '' @xmath11 that modulates the otherwise isotropic and homogeneous probability that a random walker jumps at time @xmath12 from its current position to the generic position @xmath13 .",
    "an example is chemotactic diffusion where @xmath11 represents the concentration of some substance affecting the drift motion of the random walker , that can be e.g. a cell , a bacterium or an ant .",
    "even if the attractiveness function @xmath11 is not per se a potential , it is shown below that its effect is to generate a term analogous to an external force in the drift - diffusion equation .",
    "diffusion processes taking places in such situations , in which the drift motion can be traced back to some attracting factor rather than to a ( known ) force , represent the subject of the present paper .",
    "the basic difference is that in the latter case the velocity field , e.g. the potential gradient in the case of brownian motion , provides by definition the actual flux of particles or the average velocity of the brownian particle .",
    "instead , the attractiveness function @xmath11 embodies the effects of some external factor on the preferences of the random walker and therefore _ vanishes in the absence of diffusion_. in the type of problems considered here , the random walker _ compares _ the ( known ) values of some attractiveness measure @xmath11 in the accessible positions before making the next jump , choosing the jump direction in a probabilistic way depending on the result of the comparison made .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to study the general drift - diffusion equation for such type of systems directly in terms of the attractiveness @xmath11 . to this aim",
    "we proceed through two steps :    we start from a general random walk in a @xmath0-dimensional space where jumps are defined by a jump probability @xmath14 from position @xmath15 at time @xmath16 to position @xmath17 at time @xmath12 .",
    "the mathematical preliminaries are laid out in sec .",
    ". then we introduce an attractiveness function @xmath18 , assuming that the probability that the jump takes place along a certain direction is proportional to the local value of the attractiveness function .",
    "the corresponding drift - diffusion equation is derived in sec .",
    "[ attraction ] .",
    "it is shown that to this aim one can simply replace the conditional jump probability @xmath14 with the corresponding _ conditional expectation _",
    "@xmath19 obtained by weighting @xmath14 with the attracting function @xmath18  see sec .",
    "[ derivation ] .",
    "the probabilistic meaning of the attracting function @xmath18 is further discussed in sec .",
    "[ stat ] .",
    "the motivation for the present investigation is that the theoretical framework outlined above and the corresponding diffusion equation obtained well suit the description of many diffusion processes in which the appearance of a drift motion can be traced back to a non - constant function @xmath18 measuring a local preference or attractiveness .",
    "the equation obtained is in fact simple , yet general enough , to be useful for applications to diffusion processes in physics and in interdisciplinary fields .",
    "some applications to chemotaxis and social dynamics are considered in sec .",
    "[ applications ] .",
    "possible developments and further applications are discussed in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "it is possible to give a general derivation of the drift - diffusion equation from a random walk model starting from an arbitrary form of the joint step - length and waiting - time distribution of the random walker  @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a similar procedure by first considering a generic jumping probability @xmath20 that describes the motion of the random walker in the absence of the attracting factor .",
    "thereafter the effect of the attracting factor on this random motion is studied and the corresponding drift - diffusion equation is derived with the kramers - moyal procedure .      here and in the following we consider the general case of a @xmath0-dimensional space , in which each point @xmath17 is specified in terms of its @xmath0 coordinates , @xmath21 . if @xmath22 is the probability that a random walker at location @xmath15 at time @xmath12 hops to location @xmath17 where it will be located at time @xmath23 , the random walker density @xmath24 at @xmath23 can be obtained from the density @xmath25 at time @xmath12 as @xmath26 the normalization condition @xmath27 is assumed to hold for any @xmath15 and @xmath28 .    to have a simple well behaved continuum limit , where the dynamics can be approximated by a diffusion equation",
    ", we impose the condition of _ locality _ : there exists a characteristic length scale @xmath29 , so that jumps with distances exceeding this scale are very improbable .",
    "formally we require for the probability of long jumps to be at least exponentially suppressed : @xmath30 time arguments will be omitted in the following , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "it is shown in appendix [ app : km_bound ] , that this form of locality defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : locality_cond ] ) is sufficient for the kramers - moyal coefficients @xmath32 to be at least of order @xmath33 . from the kramers - moyal procedure",
    "we obtain that the behavior of the random walkers at large scales is described by a drift - diffusion like equation of the form ( see app . [ app : kme_derivation ] ) @xmath34      +    \\mathcal{o}\\left(\\epsilon^{3}/\\tau\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus in the continuum limit , i.e. when @xmath35 with @xmath36 fixed , the higher order terms vanish and the diffusion equation is obtained in its canonical form . above @xmath37 , @xmath38 and summation over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 are the drift and the diffusion terms corresponding to @xmath41 : @xmath42    we stress that the characteristic length @xmath29 of the steps and a fixed time interval @xmath43 between the steps are the only restrictions imposed the motion of the random walker .",
    "thus our set - up is fairly general as , at the macroscopic level , it can be applied to any drift - diffusion equation .      in the following",
    "we assume the existence of an external inhomogeneous effect , due to the local landscape attractiveness , on top of the random motion assumed above and study its effects on the drift and diffusion of the brownian particle .",
    "the attracting factor is represented by the function @xmath18 , that is assumed to modulate the diffusion so that the transition probability becomes proportional to it , i.e. , @xmath44 since @xmath18 is not a probability but only modulates it , it has to be normalized in order to obtain the jump probability : the normalization conditions require that the driftless hopping probability @xmath45 is replaced by the conditional expectation value  @xcite weighted by the attracting function @xmath18 , @xmath46 this new hopping probability @xmath47 still obeys the normalization condition of eq .",

    "is usually no net systematic drift due to some sort of forces pushing individuals along certain directions , i.e. , it is difficult to formulate an analogue of the external potential acting on a brownian particle . on the other hand ,",
    "it is natural to introduce ( and possibly measure experimentally ) the inhomogeneous probability that a certain path rather than another one is followed and express such a probability in terms of a local attracting factor .",
    "for instance , paths that follow sea and river shores are known to represent corridors characterized by a higher mobility , while the same shores or mountains interrupting a path are locally associated to lower effective diffusivities  @xcite .    in the dispersal of human or animal groups ,",
    "diffusion may become non - linear , since the presence of other individuals will condition the diffusion process of each single individual deciding in which direction to make the next diffusive step .",

    "interestingly , in this case the corresponding attracting factor , @xmath117 resembles a stretched boltzmann - gibbs shape and reduces to the canonical form for @xmath118 .",
    "it is worth mentioning other types of diffusion processes taking place across geographical landscapes , in which the probability that the diffusion process develops along a certain direction can be best related to some local factor rather than to an external force producing a drift . in this set of problems one can find e.g. processes of epidemic diffusion , opinion dynamics , and ( technological ) innovation spreading .",

    "many - agents social dynamics models or continuous opinion spreading models such as the model by borghesi and bouchaud , introduced to study political elections  @xcite , can provide a detailed description of the system state evolution and the corresponding modulated diffusion process .",
    "the example of the spreading of agriculture during the neolithic age is an interesting example of technological innovation spreading , since it took place across a wide area but under the influence of various factors , such as the same underlying geography affecting human dispersal or the geophysical properties of the land related to its suitability for agricultural purposes  see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent investigation .",
    "studies dealing specifically with technological spreading have to take into account the landscape inhomogeneities .",
    "for instance hgerstrand s model of innovation diffusion  @xcite describes the level of adoption of a new innovation in terms of a mean information field evolving in space and time according to a reaction - diffusion - like equation .",
    "there are various factors making such a process inhomogeneous , possibly affecting directly the innovation diffusion process , see e.g. refs .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a framework providing a simple description of a diffusion process influenced by some local factor represented by an assigned attracting function @xmath51 .",
    "this framework may be most suitable to study problems of random motion in which the random walkers are able to compare the possible directions and to use the gathered information to make a ( probabilistic ) decision about the direction of the next step .",
    "the information about the positions is encoded in the attracting function @xmath51 so that locations with a higher value of the attracting function are chosen with an higher probability .",
    "we have discussed the example of chemotactic diffusion , also mentioning how the framework proposed easily lends itself to the study of other ecological and dispersal models where the influence of the spatial landscape can be described by a local fitness @xmath18 .",
