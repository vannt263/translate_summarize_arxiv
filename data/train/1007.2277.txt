    "the main goal of this experiment was the determination of the excitation function for the quasi - free @xmath6 reaction near the kinematical threshold .",
    "the motivation was the comparison of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 total cross - sections in order to learn about the production mechanism of the @xmath4 meson in the channels of isospin 1 and 0 , and to investigate aspects of the gluonium component of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 has not been measured so far , and the existing predictions differ drastically depending on the model .",
    "cao and lee  @xcite assumed , by analogy to the production of the @xmath3 meson , that the production of the @xmath4 meson proceeds dominantly via the s@xmath9(1535 ) resonance .",
    "as a consequence , they predicted within an effective lagrangian approach a @xmath10 value equal to the experimentally established @xmath11 value .",
    "in contrast , kaptari and kmpfer  @xcite predicted a value of @xmath10 close to @xmath121.5 in the kinematic range of the cosy11 experiment with the dominant contribution coming from the meson conversion currents . in the extreme scenario of glue - induced production saturating the @xmath4 production cross - section ,",

    "the total cross - section for the @xmath7 reaction was measured in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "it reveals a strong excess energy dependence , especially very close to threshold .",
    "this dependence must be taken into account when comparing to the results for the @xmath6 reaction which were established for 8  mev excess energy intervals .",
    "therefore , for a given interval of excess energy , we have determined the mean value of the total cross - section for @xmath7 reaction using the parametrisation of fldt and wilkin  @xcite fitted to the experimental data  @xcite . for the @xmath4 meson",
    "the upper limit of the ratio for the excess energy range @xmath13 $ ]  mev is nearly equal to values of the ratio obtained for the @xmath3 meson , whereas for larger excess energy ranges @xmath14 $ ]  mev and @xmath15 $ ]  mev the upper limits of the ratio are lower by about one standard deviation each .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is @xmath17  6.5 at excess energies larger than @xmath18  mev  @xcite suggests the dominance of isovector meson exchange in the production mechanism .",
    "the decrease of @xmath16 close to the threshold  @xcite may be explained by the different energy dependence of the proton  proton and proton  neutron final state interactions  @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath10 than @xmath19 is consistent with a possible greater role for singlet currents in @xmath4 production than @xmath3 production . if there are important new dynamics in the @xmath4 production process relative to eta production , a key issue is the relative phase  @xcite of possible additional exchanges compared to the isovector currents which dominate the @xmath3 production .",
    "the observed limit thus constrains modelling of the production processes . to confirm these interesting observations and to go further ,",
    "new experimental investigations with improved statistics are required .",

    "meson interaction to be gained not only from the shape of the excitation function but also from differential distributions of proton  proton and proton  meson invariant masses . therefore , in order to investigate the proton@xmath3 interaction the cosy11 collaboration performed a measurement  @xcite of the proton@xmath3 and proton  proton invariant mass distributions close to the threshold at q = 15.5 mev , where the outgoing particles possess small relative velocities . indeed a large enhancement in the region of small proton@xmath3 and large proton ",
    "proton relative momenta was observed .",
    "however , the observed effect can not be univocally assigned to the influence of the proton@xmath3 interaction in the final state  @xcite , since it can also be explained by the admixture of higher partial waves in the proton  proton system @xcite , or by the energy dependence of the production amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the endeavor to explain the origin of the observed enhancement motivated the measurement of the proton  proton and proton@xmath4 invariant mass distributions for the @xmath7 reaction presented in this article .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    within the statistical and systematic error bars both model of deloff  @xcite and of nakayama et  al.@xcite describe the data well although they differ slightly in the predicted shapes .",
    "this indicates that perhaps , not only higher partial waves but also the energy dependence of the production amplitude should be taken into account .",
    "also , the inclusion of the proton  proton final state interaction is not sufficient to explain the enhancement seen in the range of large @xmath21 values .    within the achieved uncertainties , the shape of the proton  proton and proton  meson invariant mass distributions determined for the @xmath4 meson is essentially the same to that established previously for the @xmath3 meson .",
    "since the enhancement is similar in both cases , and the strength of proton@xmath3 and proton@xmath4 interaction is different @xcite , one can conclude that the observed enhancement is not caused by a proton  meson interaction .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the presented invariant mass distributions , it is not possible to disentangle univocally which of the discussed models is more appropriate .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , future measurements of the spin correlation coefficients should help disentangle these two model results in a model independent way .",
    "in the latest review by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , two values for the total width of the @xmath0  meson are given .",
    "one of these values , ( 0.30  @xmath26  0.09 )  mev / c@xmath27 , results from the average of two measurements  @xcite , though only in one of these experiments was @xmath25 extracted directly based on the mass distribution  @xcite . the second value ( 0.205  @xmath26  0.015 )  mev / c@xmath27 , recommended by the pdg , is determined by fit to altogether 51 measurements of partial widths , branching ratios , and combinations of particle widths obtained from integrated cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "the result of the fit is strongly correlated with the value of the partial width @xmath28 , which causes serious difficulties when the total and the partial width have to be used at the same time , like _",
    "e.g. _ in studies of the gluonium content of the @xmath0meson  @xcite .",
    "the value of the total width of the @xmath0 meson was established directly from its mass distribution independently of other properties of this meson , like _",
    "e.g. _ partial widths or production cross - sections .",
    "the @xmath0 meson was produced in proton  proton collisions via the @xmath1 reaction and its mass was reconstructed based on the momentum vectors of protons taking part in the reaction .",
    "the reader interested in the description of the detectors and analysis procedures can find detailed informations in ref .",
    "the momentum of the cosy beam and the dedicated zero degree cosy11 facility enabled the measurement at an excess energy of only a fraction of an mev above the kinematic threshold for the @xmath4 meson production .",
    "this was the most decisive factor in minimizing uncertainties of the missing mass determination , since at threshold the partial derivative of the missing mass with respect to the outgoing proton momentum tends to zero .",
    "in addition , close to threshold the signal - to - background ratio increases due to the more rapid reduction of the phase space for multimeson production than for  the  @xmath4 .",
    "the systematic error was estimated by studying the sensitivity of the result to the variation of parameters describing the experimental conditions in the analysis and in the simulation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the total systematic error was estimated as the quadratic sum of independent contributions and is @xmath29  mev / c@xmath27 .",
    "the final missing mass spectra are presented in fig .",
    "the total width of the @xmath0  meson was extracted from the missing - mass spectra and amounts to @xmath30 @xmath31  mev / c@xmath27 .",
    "the result does not depend on knowing any of the branching ratios or partial decay widths .",
    "the extracted @xmath25 value is in agreement with both previous direct determinations of this value  @xcite , and the achieved accuracy is similar to that obtained by the pdg  @xcite .",
