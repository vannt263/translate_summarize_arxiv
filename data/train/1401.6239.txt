    "asteroseismology was born as a natural extension of helioseismology ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the success of helioseismology results from the ability to extract information from the sun s interior through accurately measured frequencies of more than 7000 acoustic oscillation modes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the development of this discipline was instrumental to improve the physics of the solar standard model that led to the resolution of the solar neutrino problem ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , asteroseismology is expected to extract information from the interiors of stars at different stages of their evolution , through the study of their observed oscillation spectrum . however , in this case , only global , low degree modes are expected to be detected , due to observational limitations . in the next decade , an unprecedented progress is expected in this research field , in part due to the large amount of data that has been made available by the missions _",
    "@xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite .",
    "up until now these missions have already detected oscillations in more than 500 stars @xcite .",
    "these seismic data are obtained with an unprecedented high precision , which opens the possibility of studying new and old pulsating stars , as well as to test the theories of stellar evolution and probe for the existence of new physics inside stars @xcite .",
    "a primordial target in asteroseismic studies is the class of sun - like stars , since these stars are expected to have an internal structure and acoustic spectrum of oscillations identical to the sun .",
    "there are a few sun - like pulsations for which a few dozen global acoustic modes were successfully identified , typically acoustic modes with a degree smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , these global oscillations are particularly interesting to study because these modes travel from the surface up to the core of the star , and thus these acoustic modes carry information about the entire structure of the star . moreover , the interest of studying this class of stars is twofold : ( 1 ) to better understand the physics behind stellar evolution in general ; and ( 2 ) to better describe the physics occurring inside our own sun . like the sun , in many",
    "sun - like stars , the intricate surface structure where there are strong interactions among the magnetic fields , the turbulent convection and the rotation , as well the steady flows of meridional circulation , allow the possibility of local glitches that can produce visible perturbations in the spectrum of stellar oscillations . it is our intent to test this theoretical scenario thoroughly and without the loss of generality .",
    "we have focused the work in a sun - like star which is the well known @xmath1 centauri a. we may have found some evidence of a perturbation of this type occurring in the oscillation spectrum of this star .    in this work , we discuss the structure of the upper layers of a sun - like star , as it is possible to be inferred from the most complete observational table of frequencies .",
    "in particular , we apply the acoustic phase shift method ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detaills ) to probe the physical mechanisms operating in these upper layers .",
    "in this sun - like star , we show that the existence of a rapid variation ( rv ) layer in the external region of the star will produce a significant amount of scattering of acoustic waves .",
    "this relatively thin layer is quite likely produced by an rv in the sound speed , which is similar to variations of sound speed that can occur in transition layers such as the well known examples in the sun of the bottom of the convection zone and the he ii ionization zone .",
    "the seismic diagnostic is done by means of the seismic parameter , which allows us to infer the scattering of acoustic waves in the surface of the star using the available table of observational frequencies .    in section 2 ,",
    "different methods are shown to compute the scattering of acoustic waves in the upper layer of the star , and the impact of a rv of sound speed produced in the acoustic potential and consequently in the acoustic phase shift . in section 3",
    "we apply this method to a toy model of a sun - like star , @xmath1 centauri a , and discuss the seismic diagnostics obtained from the observational data available for this star .",
    "a comparison is made between the theoretical data and the observational data .",
    "this comparison suggests that the internal structure of the stars could be quite different from what is predicted by the theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "it specifically indicates the presence of a thin layer where the sound speed undergoes an abrupt variation .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we present a summary and the conclusions of this work .",
    "the asymptotic theory of adiabatic , non - radial oscillations has been used and developed in the past , based on the fact that the oscillation modes have wavelengths shorter than the scale of local variations of the background state . however , in the regions near the stellar surface , this approximation is no longer valid .",
    "in fact , the thermal and dynamical time scales in the stellar surface are of the same order of magnitude , contrary to what happens in the interior of a sun - like star , for which the former is much larger than the latter .",
    "consequently , the classical asymptotic theory gives a poor account of the propagation of waves in these more external layers .",
    "strictly speaking , this means that the oscillations are no longer adiabatic , and an important exchange of energy occurs between the propagating wave and the background state . to solve this problem ,",
    "@xcite has introduced a frequency dependency on phase shift to take into account the scattering of waves in these external layers .",
    "this phase shift frequency dependency is an obvious generalization of the reflection condition that occurs for all waves when reflected in a simple stellar isothermal atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "the phase shift @xmath1 rather than being a constant value for all acoustic modes , such as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the polytropic index of an isothermal atmosphere of a star like the sun for which @xmath6 , now becomes dependent on the frequency of the mode , such as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the frequency of the mode of oscillation .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that this phase shift can be partly inferred by means of the seismic observable @xmath9 , a proxy of the phase shift @xmath10 that is computed either from the phase shift scattering occurring in the stellar envelope , or from a table of frequencies of the modes that propagate through the same region .",
    "several methods were developed to determine the scattering of acoustic waves in the outer layers of the sun and stars .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in the literature .",
    "the fourth - order system of ordinary differential equations describing the linear adiabatic oscillations in the cowling approximation ( the gravitational effects are small in the outer layers ) can be reduced to a second - order schrdinger - type equation , considering that the trajectories of the acoustic waves in the surface layers are vertical .",
    "it follows that the equation of acoustic oscillations reads @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the acoustic depth , @xmath13 the acoustic potential , @xmath14 the cyclic frequency and @xmath15 the wave function .",
    "the acoustic depth is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the adiabatic sound speed , and @xmath18 is the stellar radius .",
    "the acoustic potential @xmath13 is defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the radial gravity acceleration .",
    "the method of the phase function @xcite was used to represent the eigenfunction @xmath15 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , with an additional condition on the amplitude function @xmath25 the outer phase shift of acoustic waves @xmath1 is computed from the stellar envelope , by numerically solving the following equation @xmath26    this equation is solved numerically with the proper initial boundary condition at @xmath27 .",
    "the details of the numerical procedure can be found in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 is obtained from numerical differentiation of @xmath28 as @xmath29 the properties of the observable @xmath9 were largely discussed by @xcite , among others .",
    "these techniques , based on an analysis of the phase shift of acoustic waves , led to the measurement of solar helium abundance by @xcite and @xcite and to a contribution of the same authors to the calibration of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the acoustic potential @xmath13 used in this calculation was determined based on a detailed stellar structure model of a sun - like star specifically computed for this analysis .",
    "the stellar evolution code cesam   was used to compute this structure model .",
    "this code has an up - to - date and refined microscopic physics ( updated equation of state , opacities , nuclear reactions rates , and an accurate treatment of the microscopic diffusion of heavy elements ) , including the solar mixture of  @xcite .",
    "the basic input physics considered are identical to the solar standard model , as discussed in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the value of @xmath30 computed using this method .",
    "the solid line represents the model being studied in this work , a star with 1.1 @xmath31 . in this figure",
    "we have also included the parameter @xmath30 calculated for a set of sun - like stars with masses from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "[ table : fits ]       with the location of an abrupt variation of the sound speed .",
    "this location is expressed in terms of the acoustic depth .",
    "the deeper the glitch , the higher the frequency of the oscillation induced in the phase @xmath0 by the glitch .",
    "the influence of the second ionization zone of helium around the @xmath34 s is visible . in this region , we have a slight increase of the frequency which contradicts the general tendency .",
    "vertical bars show the location of a pretended glitch to induce an oscillation with the same period that we obtained from the observational @xmath0 .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the seismic parameter @xmath30 is the best proxy of the phase shift of acoustic waves that occurs as a consequence of the scattering of these waves in the upper layers of the star .",
    "@xmath30 , as previously mentioned , can be computed from a table ( theoretical or observational ) of frequencies .",
    "the algorithm reads @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the degree and radial order of the oscillation mode .",
    "we developed an algorithm that allows the calculation of these derivatives using the maximum of points available .",
    "this algorithm is based upon the formula proposed by @xcite , to study the acoustic phase shift in the sun .",
    "the partial derivatives in @xmath41 should be treated carefully due to the small number of points available usually in observational frequency tables . in the specific case of this work we decided to use only the modes with degrees @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the modes with degrees @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the modes with the biggest number of observational frequencies available , and thus , the modes that lead to a more reliable result . the richness and properties of the observable @xmath9",
    "were largely discussed by lopes and collaborators .",
    "@xmath41 computed as indicated in equation ( 10 ) allows a direct comparison between the star and its stellar model , specifically , highlighting the physical process differences in the upper layers of the model and the star .",
    "we computed @xmath41 using a theoretical table for the same stellar structure model used in the computation of @xmath30 from the stellar envelope ( see the previous section ) .",
    "the frequencies were obtained using a pulsation code that computes the adiabatic non - radial oscillations of the stellar structure model  .",
    "the theoretical table of frequencies obtained comprises around @xmath42 frequencies that correspond to acoustic modes with degree @xmath43 , and @xmath40 , taking values between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) shows the computation of the @xmath0 in the case of a sun - like star with a mass of @xmath46 .",
    "two methods of computing @xmath0 are represented ; the two theoretical descriptions of @xmath41 .",
    "the computation of @xmath47 from the theoretical frequencies were performed over a range of frequencies between 1mhz and 5mhz .",
    "the @xmath30 computed from the stellar envelope has a very good overall agreement with the @xmath47 calculated from the theoretical table of frequencies .",
    "the general form of @xmath0 is very identical to the one obtained in the case of the sun @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath30 , in the case of the sun spreads throughtout a range of frequencies between @xmath44 to @xmath48 mhz . in the case of this sun - like star",
    ", the equivalent range is between @xmath44 to @xmath49 mhz .",
    "the shape of @xmath30 is especially influenced by two factors : the superadiabatic region with a contribution of the hydrogen ionization zone , which defines the parabola form , and the zone of the partial ionization of helium which is responsible for the production of a sinusoidal component .",
    "this helium signature is evidenced in figure 1 , the larger the mass of the star the stronger the sinusoidal component .",
    "@xmath50 also has a weak dependence on the initial phase .",
    "furthermore , in the case of low degree acoustic modes , it is known that there is a strong dependence of @xmath47 on the degree of the mode .",
    "this effect occurs due to the contribution of eulerian perturbation of the gravitational field to define eigen - frequencies of oscillation .",
    "this leads to @xmath51 presenting a dependence with the degree @xmath39 .",
    "this effect is very visible in the case of the sun @xcite .",
    "this sun - like star also shows the same effect . however , it is less visible ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this , in part , explains the difference between @xmath0 computed from the stellar envelope ( the solid line ) and @xmath0 computed from the theoretical table of frequencies for @xmath52 ( dotted lines ) .      in the internal structure of stars ,",
    "there are some regions where the sound speed changes rapidly due to changes in the structure .",
    "these regions are usually called glitches and they introduce an oscillatory behavior in the frequencies proportional to @xmath53 where @xmath54 gives the location of the glitch @xcite . as an example , in the sun , the base of the convective zone and the helium ionization zone and their oscillatory signatures were studied in detail by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "application to sun - like stars was a natural step forward : methods to locate the base of the convective zone and the he ii ionization zone were studied and developed by , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , and .",
    "all these regions are in fact transition layers , where a sharp variation of the sound speed occurs .",
    "acoustic sound waves are reflected and refracted in the surface of the star and by these layers .",
    "the phase shift generated by these regions was estimated by @xcite .",
    "considering that the acoustic potential has a variation of @xmath55 within an interval @xmath56 , there will be a variation of the eigenfuncion @xmath57 . from equation ( 1 )",
    "we can reach the following wronskian @xmath58^{\\tau_2}_{\\tau_1 } = \\int_{\\tau_1}^{\\tau_2 } \\delta u^2 \\psi_1\\ , \\psi_2\\ , { d}\\tau\\ ] ] where @xmath59 the eigenfunction @xmath15 given by equation ( 6 ) allows us to rewrite the wronskian @xmath58^{\\tau_2}_{\\tau_1 } = \\omega a_1(\\tau_2 , \\omega ) a_2(\\tau_2 , \\omega ) \\sin(\\pi \\alpha_0).\\ ] ] this is obtained considering the outer boundary condition at @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 . at a first approximation , and not taking into account the variation of the amplitude for @xmath56 , we have @xmath63 d \\tau,\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 is the phase shift of the unperturbed eigenfunction .",
    "this is a general expression which approximately estimates the phase shift @xmath65 induced by a variation of the acoustic potential within an interval in the acoustic depth for some value of the frequency @xmath66 .",
    "as we can see , this induced phase shift will depend on the particular feature that is described by @xmath67 .",
    "discontinuities in the first derivative of the sound speed produce glitches in the acoustic potential and can be represented by a dirac @xmath68 function .",
    "we will see that this perturbation in the potential will produce an additional periodic component .",
    "indeed , if we represent the acoustic potential as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the unperturbed potential , @xmath71 is the contribution to the acoustic potential from the glitch ( i.e from the discontinuity in the first derivative of the sound speed ) and @xmath68 is the dirac @xmath68-function , we obtain directly from integral ( 14 ) @xmath72.\\ ] ]    this @xmath73 can be seen as the quasi - periodic contribution to the phase shift which originates from the discontinuity in the first derivative of the sound speed .",
    "we numerically simulated a small variation of sound speed , typically smaller than @xmath74 , and realized that small variations of sound speed of such magnitudes can originate acoustical glitches in the potential . in this procedure , several different locations for @xmath54 were tested , namely between the acoustic depth of @xmath75s ( 0.99@xmath76 ) and @xmath77s ( 0.88@xmath76 ) .",
    "figure 2 illustrates these tests made with the modified acoustic potential and the correspondent effects on the seismic parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the  period \" of the observed quasi - periodic signal is determined by the location of the rv region and its amplitude is determined by the magnitude of the discontinuity in the acoustic potential @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows the different locations tested and the corresponding periods of the oscillation generated by the rv region . in figure 3 , we fitted the values of table 1 with a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial .",
    "we clearly see the decreasing tendency of the period of the oscillatory feature , except in the he ii ionization region . in particular ,",
    "we want to focus now on the two cases of figure 4 .",
    "this figure shows two of the previous scenarios : the a3 ( blue ) and the b3 ( red ) layers represent the positions where the glitch is located .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows @xmath30 computed for these two new scenarios , as well as @xmath30 corresponding to the non - modified potential ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the observed @xmath0 suggests that the real @xmath1 centauri a could have an identical potential feature located in the external layers of the star .",
    "however , a recent study by @xcite of the overshoot region at the bottom of sun s convective zone , suggests that the regions of transition in real stars might be smoother than generally predicted by theoretical models .",
    "the stars of the @xmath1 centauri stellar binary system are among the most studied and observed sun - like stars .",
    "being this binary system the closest to the earth , it makes it so its stars have a well known set of observational constraints .",
    "this work was applied to the study of the upper layers of @xmath1 centauri a , the most massive star in this binary system .",
    "this was done using the acoustic phase shift and some seismic properties of this star .",
    "a large number of stellar evolution models have been developed for this star .",
    "the first model was computed by @xcite , where they assumed a solar composition for the star @xmath1 cen a , but were not able to obtain the precise astrometric and photometric parameters . until the year 2000 , several models were proposed , based exclusively on non - asteroseismic constraints : , @xcite , , @xcite , , , and @xcite .",
    "all these theoretical models were unable to give an unambiguous description of the stellar parameters . in 2002 , , obtained a definitive identification of _",

    "their work was based on the accurate estimate of the parallax by .",
    "one year later , using new interferometric measurements made for this star , provided accurate measurements of the angular diameters for the @xmath1 cen system , which allowed the precise determination of the radii .",
    "these new constraints generated a new set of models for the stars @xmath1 centauri : , , , and .",
    "these models were able to fit some of the asteroseismic constraints , but they left some questions unanswered , such as the nature of the core of the star .",
    "our @xmath1 centari a model was calibrated to have the present stellar radius @xmath78 , luminosity @xmath79 , mass @xmath80 and age @xmath81 .",
    "the model was also required to have a fixed value of the photospheric ratio @xmath82 , where _ x _ and _ z _ are , respectively , the mass fraction of hydrogen and the mass fraction of elements heavier than helium .",
    "the value of @xmath82 we adopted was proposed by .",

    "the derivatives in equation ( 10 ) were calculated using up to five - point central differences formulas .",
    "the problem with any numerical differentiation is directly connected with the structure of the experimental data : small perturbations on the function to be differentiated may cause large errors in the numerical derivatives . in our case , the frequencies used to evaluate the derivatives differ by a value of @xmath85 and the uncertainties in the frequencies are , in the worse case , given by @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the error in calculating the derivatives will never exceed a few percents .",
    "several tests were performed to verify the quality and stability of the algorithm to compute @xmath0 from this observational frequency table . in particular , we have repeatedly added a random white noise on the observed frequencies ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this white noise was added within the larger value of the frequency measurement error ( @xmath88 ) and the procedure was executed 400 times . at the same time , we used the propagation error theory to calculate the error bars associated with the exact value of the uncertainties of the observational frequencies .",

    "indeed , in this case , the ability to measure the period of the signature @xmath0 will be lost , since we have reached the limit of resolution of the method which can be expressed by the sampling theorem ( kotelnikov / nyquist - shannon ) .",

    "we are mainly interested in the seismic parameter @xmath0 .",

    "based on the previously mentioned studies we made a test to the observational @xmath84 with the intent to isolate this new oscillation feature . in this approach , we start to compute the difference between the observational and the theoretical values of the seismic parameter @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath97 . the @xmath98 was obtained by making a spline fit to the theoretical values of @xmath84 ( see the black dots in figure 1 ) .",
    "we think this is a more accurate representation of the theoretical @xmath99 of the star rather than using the @xmath99 computed from the stellar envelope .",
    "this procedure allows us to eliminate any contribution from the superadiabatic region and the second helium ionization zone from the observations .",
    "following such procedure , we performed a sinusoidal least - squares fit to each @xmath100 with fixed @xmath39 .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 and the coefficients of the fits were determined with 95% confidence intervals . here again , if we use the _ period _ of each oscillation to estimate the location of the acoustic waves associated with _ rv layer _ , we find the following results : for @xmath100 computed for modes with degree @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the angular frequencies are @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively , which implies the frequency will be @xmath103 .",
    "next , we can calculate the  period \" @xmath104 and this period gives us the acoustic depth @xmath105 .",
    "these results suggest the existence of the _ rv layer _ below the region of partial ionization of helium .",
    "however , its exact location seems to be more difficult to determine .",
    "it is well known that the upper turning points for low frequency modes are located deeper in the surface layers than the turning points for modes with higher frequencies .",
    "considering the observational frequencies , a typical mode of 2.4 mhz , will have its upper turning point at @xmath106 whereas a mode with a lower frequency of 1.7 mhz has its upper turning point at @xmath107 .",
    "we took into account this shift and found no significative differences for the location of the glitch in terms of normalized radius @xmath108 ( in the case of the mode with degree @xmath35 we found @xmath109 instead of @xmath110 listed in table 2 and no differences in the case of the mode with degree @xmath36 ) .",
    "we think it is possible to say that the radial location of the glitch in table 2 is not affected by the vertical stratification in the surface layers and the upper reflection boundary is well approximated by the photospheric radius .",

    "to have an idea of the expression of this uncertainty we represented all the range of this uncertainty with a grey double arrow in figure 4 .",
    "some seismic indicators frequently used to identify sharp variations of the sound speed in a sun - like star , display an effect known as the aliasing problem .",

    "this effect was first noticed by and then by @xcite in the case of gravity modes .",
    "we think that the method described in this paper , which uses the seismic observable @xmath0 , is safe from this aliasing effect . by definition , @xmath113 ( see equation ( 10 ) ) is computed considering the maximum number of modes available ( with @xmath114 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this method should , whenever possible , be used in combination with other seismic methods to validate the results .",
    "in this work , we explore the diagnostic capabilities of `` the acoustic phase shift method '' to probe the detailed structure of stellar envelopes . we specifically develop a technique to infer the impact that a small rv layer ( located in the upper layers of the star ) and a glitch of the sound speed have on the acoustic phase shift , or equivalently , on the frequencies of the acoustic modes .",
    "in particular , we test our method in the case of the spectrum of acoustic oscillations of a @xmath115 sun - like star . the diagnostic of the acoustic phase shift is obtained by means of a functional constructed from the table of frequencies , usually known as the seismic parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this observable @xmath0 , that is a derivative of the phase of the acoustic modes , is therefore used to deduce the properties of the physical processes occurring in the upper layers of a sun - like star .    following",
    "that , we decided to test our technique in the case of the star @xmath1 centauri a. we have computed @xmath30 for the theoretical and observational tables of frequencies .",
    "we noticed that there is a disagreement between the theoretical @xmath0 ( obtained numerically by integrating the wave equation through the external layers and from a theoretical frequency table ) and the observational @xmath0 .",
    "this disagreement is due to a sinusoidal - like feature found in the observational @xmath0 , but absent in the theoretical one . such surprising result obtained in this preliminary study of @xmath1 centauri a , motivated us to inquire further about this observed feature and further test the validity of our result by computing @xmath99 for several stellar envelopes and by comparing @xmath0 with other seismic diagnostics . using @xmath30 as a probe tool",
    ", we have constructed several stellar envelope models with a local perturbed sound speed profile .",
    "we found that only a small rv on the sound speed ( or equivalently in the acoustic potential ) , i.e. , a glitch , could explain the origin of this observed sinusoidal - like feature in @xmath0 .",
    "we also found that the period and amplitude of this sinusoidal - like feature gives the location , thickness , and height of the glitch . in this specific case of @xmath1 centauri",
    "a , the glitch is located around an acoustical depth of @xmath116 s ( @xmath89 0.940@xmath76 ) .",
    "the existence of a helium ii ionization layer in the envelope of these types of stars , is among the physical processes that best explain such types of sinusoidal - like features in the stellar acoustic spectrum , or @xmath0 , including the star used in our case study - @xmath1 centauri a. indeed , the fact that a glitch located in the envelope of a sun - like star could produce a sinusoidal - like signature in the acoustic modes was first pointed out by  @xcite .",
    "we believe that even if this is not the only way to obtain this type of sinusoidal like feature , this physical process is among the best candidates to explain it . in particular , in the case of @xmath1 centauri a , this could explain the existence of the rv layer located 6% below the surface of the star . however , stellar evolution models of these types of sun - like stars , predict the location of the helium ii ionization around 2% below the surface , which is well above the value found from the observational data .",
    "the exact physical mechanism responsible for the scattering of the acoustic waves in the sun - like stars is still unknown and needs further investigation .",
    "nevertheless , there are a few indications from theoretical and observational studies that favor the existence of these rapid transition layers in the interior of sun - like stars . among others ,",
    "we could mention the partial ionization of heavy elements ( for example carbon , nitrogen and oxygen ) , which in some stars such as sub dwarf b stars  @xcite excited oscillations by the opacity mechanism , near surface rotational shear layer connected with meridional flows within the upper part of convection zone  @xcite , and physical processes such as penetrative convection  .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the existence of convective cores in stars , especially , if their mass is above the critical mass value of @xmath117  @xcite , could increase the amplitude of this observed sinusoidal - like feature .",
    "indeed , we made several tests and found that in the case of a sun - like star with a convective core , it is still possible to observe a sinusoidal - like feature in @xmath0 , identical to the one observed in figures 3 and 5 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the period associated with this feature rules out the possibility of it being created by the convective core .",
    "however , we think that waves traveling from the core toward the surface , when perturbed by a rv layer of a glitch located in the stellar envelope , will experiment a wave interference process that could reinforce or even amplify the observed sinusoidal - like feature produced by the glitch .    finally , it is important to highlight that this method , based on the scattering of the acoustic waves in the outer layers of the sun - like stars , can also be used to study others stars , and thus can contribute to and increase our knowledge of their interiors . the observable @xmath30 is a natural theoretical - observable of the acoustic phase shift which can become a powerful tool to extract information on the stellar structure from the acoustic global modes .",
    "we want to thank to the referee for his comments that led to a deepening of the theoretical aspects of the relation between a region of rapid variation of the sound speed inside a star and its signature in the phase shift .",
    "referee comments also resulted in a more accurate and robust manuscript .          , m. , grevesse , n. , & sauval , a.  j. 2005 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
