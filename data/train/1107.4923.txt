    "polarized particle beams are widely used in state - of - the - art high - energy physics ( hep ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the beam polarization , which corresponds to the average of the particle beam spins , is an essential beam feature , critical to several fundamental physical problems , including precision tests to the standard model  @xcite , the search for the higgs boson  @xcite , and the discovery of new physics , for instance , in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art and future accelerators are aiming at the acceleration of highly polarized electron beams .",
    "for instance , design for the international linear collider ( ilc ) considers 0.5 tev electron beams with polarizations above @xmath1 ( close to the maximum polarization of @xmath2 , where all the beam particles spins are aligned in the same direction ) , with typical depolarizations below @xmath3  @xcite , which are mainly associated with the beam - beam interaction at the interaction point .",
    "the maximum acceleration gradients that can be attained in standard accelerators , and that directly impacts on their size , and cost , is limited by material breakdown thresholds .",
    "the use of plasma waves to accelerate particles can , therefore , play an important role in future generations of accelerators by sustaining acceleration gradients which can be more than three orders of magnitude higher than standard accelerators  @xcite .    in plasma",
    "based acceleration ( pba ) , accelerating structures can be excited by either particle or laser drivers .",
    "the most striking experiments using electron beam drivers [ plasma wakefield acceleration ( pwfa ) ] doubled the energy of 42 gev electron beams in 80 cm long plasmas  @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained in the blowout regime , where plasma electrons are evacuated from the region where the driver propagates .",
    "the resulting wakefield structures are characterized by linear accelerating and focusing forces , and are ideally suited for electron acceleration  @xcite .",
    "the most important advances using laser pulse drivers [ laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) ] , also occurred in the blowout regime , and demonstrated the acceleration of 1 gev electron beams in cm scale plasmas  @xcite .",
    "several techniques were also devised in order to control the acceleration processes  @xcite , adjusting the bunch energy , charge  @xcite , and transverse features  @xcite .",
    "recently , the use of proton drivers was also proposed as a means to accelerate electron beams even further to @xmath4 in @xmath5 plasmas  @xcite .",
    "these results show , clearly , the capability of pba , and in particular , the capability of the blowout regime of pba , to accelerate high - quality electron beams to high energies  @xcite in controlled acceleration scenarios . however , for a future plasma - based linear collider , or for a plasma afterburner  @xcite , it is important not only to achieve high final output energies , but also to achieve low and controlled depolarization rates .",
    "the depolarization of an electron beam is fully determined by the temporal evolution of the direction of the spin , @xmath6 , of each beam electron . during its acceleration ,",
    "the spin of the electron can change according to two different mechanisms : the stochastic spin diffusion from photon emission  @xcite , and the spin precession around the electric and the magnetic fields  @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "the stochastic spin diffusion is a non - deterministic process consisting in the rotation of the spin vector in the presence of a magnetic field , with the emission of a photon .",
    "the sokolov - ternov effect  @xcite ( spin - flip ) is a well - known stochastic spin diffusion mechanism , which can polarize electron beams in circular accelerators . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin precession is a deterministic process , and can be examined by treating the spin as an intrinsic electron magnetic moment .",
    "the spin precession is an important mechanism that has a decisive role in the design of accelerators . in circular accelerators , for instance , the spin precession can depolarize the beam completely if the spin precession frequency is a multiple of the orbital frequency ( depolarizing resonance )  @xcite . in linear accelerators ( linacs ) and colliders , however , the typical depolarizations are as low as @xmath7 for @xmath8 accelerators and colliders  @xcite .",
    "this work is then focused on the dynamics of spin precession in plasma wakes , while the nondeterministic spin diffusion is left for a future work .",
    "this paper shows that the electron beam depolarization during the acceleration in pbas may fulfill the requirements for high energy physics experiments , provided that the beam emittances are sufficiently low , and shows that depolarizations of @xmath0 can be achieved in 100 - 500 gev accelerators . in section  [ sec : precession ] , the thomas  bargman - michel - telegdi ( t - bmt ) equations , which describe the spin precession of relativistic charged particles , are used to derive a set of coupled equations for the spin precession in plasma accelerators .",
    "this analysis reveals that the spin precession is fully determined by the transverse forces that act on relativistic particles . in sec .",

    "[ sec : sgvseg ] it is shown that externally guided propagation regimes lead to lower depolarization rates in comparison to self - guided propagation regimes .",
    "in addition , it is found that the depolarization of higher energy plasma accelerators is lower than that of lower energy plasma accelerators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] the model is compared with numerical simulations in scenarios that go beyond the validity limits of the analytical theory . two approaches were used : in the first approach , the prescribed electromagnetic fields and trajectories of electrons in the blowout regime are considered ; the second approach uses the fully self - consistent electromagnetic fields and electron trajectories from 3d pic simulations in quickpic  @xcite . finally , in sec .",
