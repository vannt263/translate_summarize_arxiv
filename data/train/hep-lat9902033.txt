    "successful lattice simulations of qcd at nonzero baryon density have yet to be achieved and the fundamental obstacle to success is the fact that standard hybrid monte carlo techniques do not admit the complex functional measure appropriate to the full theory .",

    "attempts have been made to study unquenched qcd at @xmath3 using the glasgow method which involves generating a statistical ensemble via hybrid monte carlo at @xmath4 , reweighting the observables by the ratio of the fermion determinant at @xmath0 to that at @xmath4 and performing a grand canonical partition function expansion in the fugacity variable @xmath5 to obtain observables for all @xmath1 , but the results were not significantly different from the quenched theory . in this paper",
    "we study the gross - neveu model which is one of the few models amenable to hybrid monte carlo simulations at nonzero density . by implementing the glasgow method in the gross - neveu model and comparing observables with those of a standard hybrid monte carlo simulation we reveal the limitations of the glasgow method .",
    "the results are relevant to qcd simulations .",

    "@xcite strongly suggests that any nonzero density simulation which incorporates a real path integral measure proportional to @xmath6 is doomed to failure due to the formation of a light `` baryonic pion '' from a quark and a conjugate quark @xcite .",
    "since an earlier simulation @xcite of the gross - neveu model at @xmath0 did not exhibit such a pathology an explanation is required .",
    "we provide a solution to this puzzle later in this paper .",
    "let us briefly review the current status of qcd simulations at nonzero density . in qcd",
    "the fermion determinant is complex for chemical potential @xmath1 non - zero , therefore generating an ensemble by monte carlo at @xmath7 is impracticable . the fermion number density , @xmath8 , measures the excess of quarks relative to anti - quarks and is expected to start to rise from zero at some value , @xmath9 .",
    "this _ onset _ , @xmath9 corresponds to the point where the phase of nuclear matter is more energetically favourable than the vacuum state ( for which @xmath10 ) .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration occurs at some critical @xmath11 and we expect @xcite that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the proton mass .",
    "quenched simulations , on the other hand , predict @xmath14 suggesting that in the limit where the bare quark mass @xmath15 chiral symmetry is restored for any @xmath3 .",
    "this result is unphysical because the pion which has baryon number zero , should not couple to the baryon chemical potential .",
    "first attempts to simulate full qcd using the glasgow method @xcite also produced perplexing results @xcite . on an @xmath16 lattice with bare quark mass @xmath17 at @xmath18 we found @xmath19 which differs considerably from the strong coupling analysis @xcite prediction @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore the scaling of @xmath9 with @xmath22 was consistent with a goldstone boson controlling the onset .",
    "this result has motivated an assessment of the effectiveness of the glasgow method via its implementation in a simpler model .    some insight into the effectiveness and the possible problems of the glasgow method was obtained by a study of qcd at infinite coupling @xcite , where we compared results obtained by use of the glasgow method with the quenched and the nearly exact ones available in that limit .",
    "glasgow results for @xmath23 were found to reproduce the quenched ones in quantitative detail .",
    "this rules out plausible physical explanations of the early glasgow onset , which include anomalously low baryonic states or thermal excitations of baryons @xcite@xcite . in the present study",
    "the glasgow results will be compared with an analogous of the quenched results ( toy model ) and with the exact results of @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we describe in detail the lattice formulation of the 3d gn model including a discussion of the symmetries and the features of the model which make it amenable to lattice simulation by the hybrid monte carlo algorithm even at nonzero chemical potential . in section",
    "iii we outline the glasgow method for the gn model which makes use of eigenvalue symmetry relations to construct a grand canonical partition function expansion in the fugacity variable .",
    "the special feature of the glasgow method is that in principle it permits simulations using any fixed value of @xmath1 in the functional measure in order to obtain observables such as fermion number density for an extensive range of @xmath1 values ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath24 . by comparison with the hybrid monte carlo simulations where the @xmath25 in the functional measure matches the @xmath26 at which the observable",
    "is calculated we assess the effectiveness of the glasgow method within the limits of our statistics . in section",
    "iii we present the results of our gross - neveu simulation using the glasgow method and provide a direct comparison with results of a standard hybrid monte carlo simulation . in section",
    "iv we present results of a toy model simulation of the gn model . in the toy model",
    "the @xmath1 in the functional measure is different from the @xmath1 at which the observable is calculated .",
    "when @xmath1 in the functional measure is set to 0 , the toy model is the gross ",
    "neveu equivalent of a quenched approximation .",
    "when @xmath1 in the functional measure equals @xmath1 at which the observables are calculated , the toy model is exact .",
    "the toy model results therefore give an insight into the relevance of including the chemical potential into the dynamics .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the glasgow method should improve over the quenched / toy model because of the reweighting . in the low statistics",
    "limit , the glasgow method should reproduce the toy results , while in the glasgow method should approach the exact results .",
    "hence the interest of considering both toy and exact results to understand the effectiveness of the glasgow method . in section v of this paper we discuss the current onset , comparing toy , glasgow , and hmc results .",
    "we will show that these onsets are all controlled by the lowest excitation in the pseudoscalar compostite spectrum .",
    "in contrast with qcd , this is not the goldstone pion , but a massive state . in section",
    "vi of this paper we consider a question which is not specific to the lattice simulation method but is highly relevant to our understanding of the physics of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we provide evidence via a hybrid monte carlo simulation that the realisation of the goldstone mechanism in the gross - neveu model ( specific to theories with four - fermion interactions ) is fundamentally different from the familiar mechanism in qcd .",
    "we show that the reason for this is that in the gross - neveu model the dominant contributions to the goldstone pion come from the disconnected diagrams .",
    "this fact precludes the existence of a light baryonic pion in @xmath0 simulations incorporating four - fermion interactions .",
    "finally in section vii we discuss the relevance of our gross - neveu model study to qcd simulations at nonzero chemical potential .",

    "coupling to @xmath48 ) , and @xmath35 `` black '' flavors with negative axial charge .",

    "standard hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations @xcite showed a clear separation of the goldstone pion mass scale and the critical chemical potential ( @xmath11 ) where chiral symmetry was restored i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "thus the lattice gross - neveu model is an example of a theory where there is no manifestation of a light goldstone pion carrying non - zero baryon number even when the model is simulated with a real path integral measure proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "we set out to investigate whether by applying the glasgow method for a given @xmath2 we could obtain from the gcpf expansion coefficients a fermion number density as a function of @xmath1 which would match the results of the standard hybrid monte carlo simulations .",
    "of particular interest was whether we would observe the discontinuity in the number density at @xmath118 via the glasgow method .",

    "in fact as we shall see in section v the toy model number density is very well approximated by a free lattice gas of fermions therefore any significant departure from the free gas behaviour for the glasgow method number density must be due to the reweighting factor @xmath60 .",

    "for @xmath184 the full model is better described by a massless free field , corresponding to @xmath191 , @xmath192 , indicating the restoration of chiral symmetry . in all cases",
    "the mean field prediction ( [ eq : mftoy ] ) reproduces the toy simulation results well , indicating that quantum fluctuations are small due to the relatively large value of @xmath193 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath11 is not observable in the toy model , since there is no chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "note however that the value @xmath9 at which the onset of @xmath187 occurs is the same for both toy and exact models , reflecting the fact that the onset on a finite lattice ( and perhaps even in the thermodynamic limit ) is not associated with the chiral transition .",
    "we emphasize that this simple analysis works well because at @xmath194 and @xmath186 the fluctuations in @xmath30 are highly suppressed .",
    "we verified that the microscopic distribution of the @xmath30 field is very sharply peaked about its constant value .",
    "this condition serves to makes the model well approximated by the appropriate free fermion field in each phase .",
    "because the two phases for @xmath195 and @xmath196 are clearly different , we anticipate that glasgow reweighting using @xmath66 will not be able to capture the chiral phase transition because the overlap between @xmath30 distributuions from each phase is likely to be very small .",
    "the overlap would be exactly zero in the infinite @xmath193 limit where fluctuations are completely suppressed .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat this exercise closer to the critical point @xmath197 although at this coupling the chiral transition is more difficult to identify .",
    "although we have shown that the glasgow method and the toy model simulations differ in their quantitative predictions for the number density @xmath198 from the standard hybrid monte carlo simulations we observe that the _ onset _ , @xmath199 in @xmath132 ( ie .",
    "the value of @xmath1 where @xmath132 starts to increase from zero which is usually interpreted as the point of chiral symmetry restoration ) _ is _ correctly predicted by both toy model and the glasgow method .",
    "this is true even for simulations with modest statistics .",
    "an important result reported in @xcite was the numerical proof that @xmath200 in standard hybrid monte carlo simulations of the gn model .",
    "thus we had an example of a theory which could be simulated at @xmath0 with dynamical fermions and where there were no pathologies associated with the fact that there was a goldstone pion in the spectrum . in the gross - neveu theory even in the toy model simulations ( which are partially quenched ) @xmath201 in agreement with the full theory .",
    "why then are there pathologies associated with @xmath202 in qcd ?",
    "we set out to gain insight into this fundamental difference between the two lattice models .",
    "we shall discover that the onset in @xmath132 always occurs at @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the mass of the pseudoscalar state measured via @xmath205 where @xmath73(@xmath206 ) is the fermion ( anti - fermion ) propagator . in qcd",
    "@xmath204 * is * the goldstone pion , however in four fermion models the goldstone mechanism is realized by the auxiliary field @xmath207 and @xmath204 is a much heavier state which appears to be close to twice the dynamical fermion mass .",
    "let us first consider the realisation of the goldstone mechanism in the gross - neveu model .",
    "in particular we measure and compare the connected and disconnected contributions to the goldstone pion .",
    "if the pion has a dominant connected contribution we expect a pole in the pseudoscalar propagator corresponding to a light particle with mass@xmath208 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the pion has a dominant disconnected contribution the mass scale corresponding to the pole in the pseudoscalar propagator will be @xmath209 .",
    "consider the lattice ward identity for the chiral condensate :    @xmath210    the pion susceptibility eqn.([eqn : ward ] ) has contributions from a connected channel ( 1st term ) and a disconnected channel ( 2nd term ) .",
    "consider the dirac kinetic operator @xmath211 for staggered fermions . at @xmath4 the relation @xmath212 holds .",
    "for @xmath0 the fact that @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) multiplies the forward ( backward ) timelike gauge links in the lattice action means that @xmath215 , because in the matrix @xmath216 , @xmath214 ( @xmath213 ) now multiplies the forward ( backward ) links . consequently the propagators @xmath73 ( with @xmath217 ) and @xmath206 are no longer trivially related as they are at @xmath4 .",
    "thus the pseudoscalar propagator , @xmath218 , is defined by    @xmath219    let @xmath220 be the smallest eigenvalue of the gibbs propagator matrix @xmath79 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : propmat ] ) . it can be shown that @xmath220 is associated with the mass pole in @xmath218 and that when we consider a single lattice configuration @xmath220 directly corresponds to a lee - yang zero and therefore induces a singularity in @xmath132 i.e. triggers the rise from zero of the fermion number density . to see this",
    "observe that @xmath63 can be simply expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath79 and @xmath70 can be similarly expressed in terms of its zeros @xmath221 in the @xmath213 plane : @xmath222    since @xmath223 we see that on a single configuration @xmath224 .",
    "note however that the ensemble averaged @xmath221 s are not in general the same as the ensemble averages of the @xmath225 s .    the number density on a single configuration @xmath226 whereas the ensemble average is given by @xmath227 .",
    "clearly the chemical potential where the number density begins to rise from zero on a single configuration will be determined by the numerical value of @xmath220 ( i.e. @xmath228 ) .",
    "it has been proved by gibbs @xcite that if we assume that the pion has a dominant connected contribution it follows that @xmath229 . in this case",
    "we can only envisage achieving a physically meaningful result ( @xmath230 ) if @xmath231 .",
    "however in the exceptional circumstance where the disconnected contribution to the pion is dominant we expect that @xmath232 so that configuration by configuration @xmath233 . in this section",
    "we shall prove that in the 3d gn @xmath71 model the goldstone pole forms in the disconnected channel therefore the state described by @xmath218 no longer corresponds to the goldstone pion .",
    "instead we find : @xmath234 since @xmath235 will now correspond to the dynamical fermion mass @xmath136 rather than @xmath236 we have no reason to expect an early onset in the gross - neveu model despite the existence of a light goldstone pion in the spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] we have plotted the propagator for the pion ( measured from the auxiliary field ) , the square of the fermion propagator and the pseudoscalar propagator .",
    "the results show that the pseudoscalar state is very close to twice the physical fermion mass and @xmath237 .",
    "what is remarkable is the fact that the auxiliary field pion is considerably lighter than @xmath204 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration in 4-fermion interaction models whereby the disconnected contributions are responsible for making the pion light .",
    "we will provide numerical evidence for this below . if we measure the pseudoscalar propagator in the standard way from @xmath205 we include only the connected contributions to the particle mass .",
    "[ fig : mu0discon_pisq ] shows the disconnected contribution to the ward identity for a standard hybrid monte carlo simulation with @xmath123 at zero chemical potential . for this simulation we found that the signal for chiral condensate from the noisy estimator was relatively stable as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0psibpsi ] giving @xmath238 , therefore we require that the sum of the connected and disconnected diagrams be of similar order so that eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ward ] is satisfied .",
    "the connected contribution was stable at a value of around 0.5 therefore the dominant contribution must come from the disconnected diagram .",
    "we found that the disconnected contribution was very noisy with large downward peaks .",
    "the data suggests that considering the connected contribution alone will never be sufficient to satisfy eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ward ] .",
    "we repeated our measurements for a non - zero chemical potential .",
    "we chose @xmath239 thus ensuring that we were still in the phase of broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the results were consistent with those at zero chemical potential as one would expect .    as a consistency check",
    "observe that we expect the following relationships to hold from the equations of motion : @xmath240    the first relationship has been checked and is satisfied by the simulation data .",
    "the second relation can also be verified .",
    "as seen in fig [ fig : mu0discon_pisq ] the characteristic peaks in the disconnected contribution are clearly correlated with the square of the pion field .",
    "we note that in the exact hmc study @xcite the pion mass was obtained from the correlator of the auxiliary field @xmath31 .",
    "the disconnected contribution to the pion susceptibility gives a very noisy signal which suggests that a very long run would be required to equilibrate sufficiently to satisfy the lattice ward identity .",
    "the glasgow method for qcd is very similar to the method described in section iii of this paper however because the qcd action is complex for ( @xmath0)we are restricted to generating the ensemble at @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore the relationship @xmath241 which we used in the lattice gross - neveu model does not hold for qcd at @xmath3 .",
    "we have seen in section iv that the gn model observables are sensitive to the choice of @xmath2 and the most accurate results were obtained for @xmath145 . clearly it is impossible to simulate qcd at @xmath242 therefore we should be aware that very high statistics are likely to be required to obtain accurate observables from the glasgow method for qcd .",
    "it is still possible that the lee - yang zeros distribution will give a hint for @xmath11 even with moderate statistics and @xmath66 . since the gross - neveu model is a purely fermionic theory it is impossible to assess from our study what influence the gauge fields have in qcd dynamics in the context of glasgow method reweighting @xcite .    in section v of this paper we have proved that the disconnected contribution to the goldstone pion is dominant in the gross - neveu model . in qcd on the other hand",
    "we know that the pion has a dominant connected contribution which implies that @xmath243 ( c.f .",
    "[ gn_pion ] ) and this explains the origins of the early onset of the chiral transition in qcd associated with a light baryonic pion .",
    "the existence of the baryonic pion in the gross - neveu model does not lead to an early onset of the chiral transition because it is the disconnected contributions which make the pion light i.e. the goldstone mechanism is realised in a fundamentally different way .",
    "in this paper we have found an example of a model where the inclusion of the chemical potential into the dynamics is essential to obtain exact results .",
    "we have proved that the physical observables of the glasgow method are sensitive to the choice of @xmath2 .",
    "the optimal choice for revealing critical behaviour is @xmath244 , a choice which is impractical for qcd simulations . in qcd",
    "the pseudoscalar channel pole is formed from _ connected _ diagrams corresponding to @xmath245 .",
    "a fermion pair with nonzero baryon charge ( baryonic pion @xcite ) forms from a quark and a conjugate quark @xcite ( i.e. a fermion associated with @xmath246 but with the sign of @xmath1 reversed ) and as a consequence the mass scale of the lightest baryon ( @xmath247 ) is @xmath236 not @xmath248 .",
    "this induces the unphysical early onset of chiral symmetry restoration in quenched qcd . in the full qcd",
    "it is conceivable that the phase of the determinant will eliminate the equality between quarks and conjugate quarks to allow us to recover the physical result @xmath249 . in principle",
    "the factor @xmath60 in the glasgow algorithm should influence the observables to take account of the phase of the determinant .",
    "the glasgow method qcd results @xcite still suggest @xmath250 .",
    "this is likely to be explained by ineffectiveness of the reweighting .",
    "the reweighting in the gross - neveu model has been shown to be ineffective and this is not surprising because in this case the statistical ensembles characterising the two phases are non - overlapping .",
    "the glasgow method may however be more effective in models more sophisticated than gross - neveu and in other dynamical regimes such as at high temperature .    in 3d gn",
    "@xmath71 the goldstone mechanism is realised by a pseudoscalar channel pole formed from _",
    "disconnected _ diagrams and the state @xmath245 yields a bound state of mass @xmath251 which is considerably heavier than the pion . as a consequence even when we consider individual configurations in this model we find @xmath252 .",
    "the different realisations of chiral symmetry breaking in the gn model and qcd have a simple physical origin . for qcd , a vector - like theory , like charges repel , so that light states only form between @xmath253 pairs ( the pathologies in simulations of qcd with @xmath166 occur because of the influence of conjugate quarks in the measure ; in this case light states may be formed from @xmath254 pairs ) .",
    "in theories with yukawa - like interactions such as the gn model , however , in the born approximation all interactions are attractive , and thus one might expect light states made of @xmath253 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "only the @xmath253 system has contributions from the disconnected diagram , however . as we have seen , binding in the connected channel is insufficient to make light states .",
    "therefore we see a natural relation between the dominance of the disconnected diagram and the absence of light states made of two quarks in the spectrum .",
    "it is also worth reconsidering why simulations of the gn model seem not to be afflicted with the problems observed in qcd . as we saw in section [ sec : lat ] , the price of simulating with a real measure @xmath257 is that the model contains both `` white '' and `` black '' fermions with opposite axial charges .",
    "we might therefore worry about attractive interactions between white and black fermions and the possibility of light bound state in the @xmath258 channel the reason that no spurious onset at @xmath259 occurs , and that the gn simulations yield results in good agreement with the mean field predictions , is intimately related to the fact that no light state occurs in this channel indeed the white - black interaction due to pion exchange in this model has the opposite sign and is thus _ repulsive _ : this is in contrast to the situation in gauge theories with real measure , where the interaction between quarks and conjugate quarks is attractive .",
    "there are interesting parallels with the standard discussion of the vafa - witten theorem @xcite , forbidding the spontaneous breaking of global vectorlike symmetries such as isospin or baryon number in field theories with a positive definite measure in the path integral ( this includes gauge theories with zero chemical potential but _ not _ yukawa or gn models , for which the measure is in general complex ) .",
    "vafa and witten do in fact discuss a ` white / black ' model with a real measure similar to ours , but with yukawa couplings to a pseudoscalar field only .",
    "their analysis does apply in this case , and a flavor - violating @xmath260 condensate is forbidden , the reason being simply that the interaction between white and black particles is repulsive .",
    "once yukawa couplings to scalar degrees of freedom are introduced , however , as in the gn model , the inequalities necessary to prove the vafa - witten theorem no longer hold .",
    "there appears to be no fundamental obstruction , therefore , to the generation of a baryon - number violating diquark condensate @xmath261 in this model , despite its measure being real ; it has been recently suggested that such a condensate forms in qcd at high density @xcite .",
    "a lattice study of this phenomenon is in progress @xcite .",
