    "the so called 3 - 3 - 1 models , with gauge symmetry @xmath4 , are interesting extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the main feature of these models is that , by choosing appropriately the representation content , the triangle anomalies cancel out and the number of families has to be a multiple of three , moreover because of the asymptotic freedom this number is just three  @xcite",
    ". in particular , the minimal version of this class of models ( m3 - 3 - 1 for short )  @xcite has other interesting predictions : it explains why @xmath5 is observed and at the same time , when @xmath6 it implies the existence of a landau - like pole at energies of the order of few tevs  @xcite ; the existence of this landau - like pole also stabilizes the electroweak scale avoiding the hierarchy problem  @xcite ; the model allows the quantization of electric charge independently of the nature of the massive neutrinos  @xcite ; it also has an almost automatic peccei - quinn symmetry , if the trilinear term in the scalar potential becomes a dynamical degree of freedom  @xcite ; and there are also new sources of cp violation with which allow to obtain @xmath7 and @xmath8 even without the ckm phase i.e. , if we put @xmath9  @xcite . and",
    ", probably it could explain cp violation in the @xmath10 mesons as well .",
    "one important feature , that distinguishes the model from any other one , is the prediction of extra singly charged and doubly charged gauge boson bileptons  @xcite and also exotic charged quarks , while the lepton sector is the same as that of the sm .",
    "right - handed neutrinos are optional in the model . they are not needed neither to generate light active neutrinos nor the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix .",
    "those exotic charged particles may have effect on the two photon decay of the sm - like higgs scalar  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all 3 - 3 - 1 models is that two of the quark triplets transform differently from the third one , and this implies flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree level , mediated by the extra neutral vector boson , @xmath2 ,  @xcite and also by neutral scalar and pseudoscalar fields .",
    "however , in these models it is not straightforward to put constraints on the @xmath2 boson mass from the analysis of the fcnc processes because the relevant observables depend on unknown unitary matrices that are needed to diagonalize the quark mass matrices .",
    "those matrices , here denoted by @xmath11 , survive in some parts of the lagrangian , in addition to their combination appearing in the ckm matrix , here defined as @xmath12 .    a possibility , as in @xcite , is not to attempt to place lower bounds on the @xmath2 mass , but rather set its mass at several fixed values and try to obtain some information about the structure of the @xmath11 matrices .",
    "moreover , usually it is considered that the dominant contribution , by far , to fcnc is the one mediated by the @xmath2 , since the contributions of the ( pseudo)scalars are assumed to be negligible .",
    "notwithstanding , we show here that this is not the most general case and there is a range of the parameters that allows interference between the @xmath2 and , at least , one neutral scalar which we assume as being the sm - like higgs with a mass around 125 gev  @xcite and , at least , one pseudoscalar field . at the lhc energies heavy ( pseudo)scalars may interfere with the @xmath2 near the resonance but this will be considered elsewhere .",
    "our analysis implies in a new range of the parameters of 3 - 3 - 1 models that have not been taken into account yet  @xcite .",
    "another difference of our analysis from those in the literature is that we first calculate the quark masses and all the unitary matrices appearing in the model , @xmath11 , and which appear , besides the usual combination @xmath13 in the charged currents with @xmath14 , in the yukawa interactions .",
    "then , we calculate the contributions of the @xmath2 and the neutral ( pseudo)scalar to fcnc processes . here",
    "we will not consider cp violation .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the values for the matrices @xmath11 should be valid at the energy scale of the m3 - 3 - 1 model , say @xmath15 .",
    "however since we do not know this energy we use instead @xmath16 .",
    "we also assume that as in the standard model , the ckm matrix elements do not change with the energy but this has to be prove in the 3 - 3 - 1 model , and probably it is not the case but its computation is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "hence , our results should be considered only as a first illustration of the sort of analysis that have to be down in most of the extensions of the sm .",

    "these results are valid for the models in refs.@xcite but other 3 - 3 - 1 models can be similarly studied .",
    "it is usually considered that 3 - 3 - 1 models reduce to the sm only at high energies . if @xmath64 is the vev that breaks the 3 - 3 - 1 symmetry down to the 3 - 2 - 1 one , then @xmath65 gev . in this limit",

    "we also have assumed that , the couplings of the scalar @xmath220 to the top quark were numerically equal to the coupling of the higgs and the top quark in the sm and that the production mechanism was , for all practical purposes , the same of the higgs of the sm as it was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : whathiggs ] . in most multi - higgs models",
    "the couplings of @xmath220 to other fermions and to @xmath295 and @xmath37 are not all full strength ( i.e. , the sm ones ) because of the mixing among all the scalar fields ( for an exception see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present model",
    ", some of these couplings may be larger and other smaller than the respective sm values , at least at @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude of some of the neutral scalars interfere some times destructively , as in @xmath448 , and some times constructively , as in the @xmath449 decay .",
    "if only @xmath2 is considered , the lower bound on @xmath103 from @xmath17 is @xmath450 tev and @xmath451 tev in @xmath265 .",
    "when the neutral scalar is considered as well , the constraint is weaker allowing a rather light @xmath2 , see secs .",
    "[ subsec : mk ] , [ subsec : mb ] and [ subsec : mc ] .",
    "the strongest constraint on the @xmath2 mass comes from @xmath452 , which is insensible to the scalar contributions and implies @xmath453 tev , but when one pseudoscalar is considered it becomes @xmath411 tev if the the pseudoscalar has a mass of around 180 gev and under the conditions defined above .",
    "however , the latter upper limit depends on the conditions @xmath425 and @xmath447 . if this is not the case , i.e.",
    ", if @xmath401 and @xmath454 are considered free parameters , a smaller bound on the @xmath2 mass is obtained : @xmath455  tev as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , which implies @xmath456 tev , @xmath457 gev , and @xmath458 gev .",
    "the leptonic kaon decay into two leptons implies a lower bound for this mass of 740 gev , see sec  [ sec : deltaf1 ] for discussions .",
    "a final remark is in order here . from eqs .",
    "( [ yukan ] ) , ( [ kapasd ] ) and ( [ kapasu ] ) , we see that the constraints depend on the matrix elements of @xmath459 given in eqs .",
    "( [ vudl331 ] ) and ( [ vudr331 ] ) .",
    "these matrices have to diagonalize the quark mass matrices and hence they depend on the input parameters @xmath460 and vevs , in these mass matrices in this work we found a set of parameters that is compatible with the quark masses , at @xmath16 , and the ckm matrix",
    ". there could exist a different set , i.e. , a different quark mass matrix , showing the same compatibility , which will be diagonalized by different @xmath459 matrices and , therefore , resulting in different values for the @xmath2 mass constraint .",
    "the set we found is show below eq.([vudr331 ] ) .",
    "we tried to find a different one without success .",
    "it seems that finding another set is not a trivial task , but it can , in principle , exist .",
    "there may be solutions with a heavy @xmath2 when there is no destructive interference in the @xmath17 amplitude but there is in @xmath237 , and so on .",
    "the main result of our work is shown that the interference between @xmath2 and ( pseudo)scalar fields exist in some range of the parameters .",
    "hence , the effects considered here may be at work in @xmath2-searches at the lhc as well but the interference will be with heavy ( pseudo)scalars , different from @xmath220 .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic dipole transitions @xmath461 , or @xmath462 , have branching ratios of the order of @xmath463 and are in agreement with the sm predictions  @xcite .",
    "for a recent analysis see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present model",
    "this sort of decays and cp violation also arise at the one - loop order through penguin and box diagrams .",
    "however , in the present case there are contributions of the singly and doubly charged scalars , exotic quarks , and singly and doubly charged vector bosons present in the model .",
    "the same happen with the @xmath0 processes since there are box diagrams involving singly and doubly charged scalar and vector bosons and exotic quarks as well .",
    "these contributions to @xmath464 will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the search for a @xmath2-like resonance has been done at the lhc . however , as in previous searches , the results are usually obtained in the context of a given model . for instance , in a top color assisted spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario this sort of ( leptophobic ) resonance has been excluded for @xmath465 tev , if @xmath466 , and @xmath467 tev , if @xmath468  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , the application of these bounds to the model considered here is not straightforward and has to be done in a separate work .",
    "last but not least , we would like to say that the m3 - 3 - 1 solution that we have presented here can be falsifiable in the near future : when the strength of the @xmath469 where measured , given at least upper limits for @xmath129 and @xmath130 , then we can check if all the couplings of the 125 gev higgs boson with the gauge bosons and all the fermions , when measured with sufficient precision , agree or not with those in eqs .",
