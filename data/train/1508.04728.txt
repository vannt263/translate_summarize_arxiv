    "a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics is the determination of the phase diagram of interacting many - particle systems .",
    "a substantial variety of pair interactions can produce a dramatic diversity of macroscopic phases , including crystals @xcite , quasicrystals @xcite , liquid crystals @xcite , hexatic phases @xcite , disordered hyperuniform systems @xcite , and liquids @xcite . while crystals and liquids are the most common condensed states of matter , there are other states in between . for example ,",
    "quasicrystals and liquid crystals both have anisotropy and long - range orientational order , like crystals , but lack long - range translational order , similar to liquids .",
    "other phases with features that lie between crystals and liquids include disordered hyperuniform systems , which are disordered but behave more like crystals in the way in which they suppress long - range density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a family of long - range isotropic pair potentials , called stealthy potentials , produces infinitely degenerate disordered hyperuniform classical ground states at high densities in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "stealthy potentials are often specially constructed such that finding a ground state is equivalent to constraining the structure factor @xmath2 to be zero for all wave vectors @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is some radial cutoff value . a dimensionless measure of the relative fraction of constrained degrees of freedom ( proportional to @xmath6 ) compared to the total number of degrees of freedom , @xmath7 , controls the degree of order and degeneracy of the ground states of these potentials .",
    "in the preceding paper @xcite , we numerically studied the entropically favored ground states , i.e. , configurations most likely to appear in the canonical ensemble in the zero - temperature limit , of stealthy potentials .",
    "we found that entropically favored ground states are disordered for @xmath8 , and crystalline for @xmath9 up to a certain critical value @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the investigation of stacked - slider phases , which are metastable states that are part of the ground - state manifold for some @xmath7 above 1/2 , although not entropically favored .",
    "stacked - slider phases were first discovered in two dimensions in ref .   and were originally called wavy crystals because they were observed to consist of particle columns that display a meandering displacement away from linearity .",
    "however , we will see that `` stacked - slider phases '' for arbitrary dimensions is a more suitable name for this phase and this designation will be used henceforth .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "easily distinguished stacked - slider phases from crystal phases by a lack of periodicity in direct space and a lack of bragg peaks in its diffraction pattern .",
    "distinguishing stacked - slider phases and disordered phases , on the other hand , was based on a different property . in disordered phases , all @xmath3 s such that @xmath10 have positive structure factors .",
    "however , in stacked - slider phases , the structure factor at some @xmath3 s such that @xmath10 are implicitly constrained to vanish identically @xcite , i.e. , they are induced to be zero by the constraints inside the radius @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of implicit constraints was used to distinguish stacked - slider phases from disordered phases in ref .  .",
    "there are still many outstanding questions concerning stacked - slider phases .",
    "can a theoretical model of stacked phases in the thermodynamic limit be devised to elucidate previous numerical studies ?",
    "one disadvantage of numerical studies is that finite - size effects make it difficult to conclude anything definitive about the large system limit .",
    "for example , are stacked - slider phases isotropic or anisotropic in this limit ? moreover , to what extent does the choice of the simulation box shape affect the results ? were any important features of stacked - slider phases overlooked by studying finite - precision simulation results ? finally , because ref .",
    "studied two dimensions only , we do not know whether stacked - slider phases exist in other dimensions .",
    "this paper provides additional insights into these unanswered questions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we perform numerical studies with much higher precision than previously .",
    "the numerical results enabled us to find an analytical model of two - dimensional stacked - slider phases , presented in sec .",
    "[ model2 ] .",
    "we generalize this model to higher dimensions in sec .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "we demonstrate that stacked - slider phases are distinguishable states of matter ; they are nonperiodic , statistically anisotropic structures that possess long - range orientational order but have zero shear modulus .",
    "the model also shows that implicit constraints exist . in sec .",
    "[ region ] we use this analytical model to show that stacked - slider phases are not entropically favored in the zero - temperature limit of the canonical ensemble . in sec .",
    "[ stability ] we postulate that the transition between stacked - slider phases and disordered phases occurs at a slightly lower @xmath7 than that reported in ref .   from energy minimizations from high - temperature limit ( poisson ) initial configurations .",
    "in sec .  [ conclusion ]",
    "we make concluding remarks and draw comparisons to other common phases of matter .",
    "in this section we numerically study the ground states of a stealthy potential at a variety of @xmath7 s ( or densities ) in two dimensions .",
    "we begin with the mathematical relations and simulation procedure in sec .",
    "[ detail ] , and then present our results in sec .",
    "[ numericalresults ] .",
    "these results will suggest an analytical model of two - dimensional stacked - slider phases in sec .",
    "[ model2 ] .",
    "as detailed in the preceding paper @xcite and other references @xcite , we simulate systems consisting of @xmath11 point particles , located at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ... , @xmath14 , in a simulation box in @xmath1 under periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the particles interact with a pairwise additive potential @xmath17 such that its fourier transform is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fourier transform of the pair potential @xmath17 , @xmath20 is a positive function , and @xmath5 is a constant .    under such potential , the total potential energy of the system can be calculated in the fourier space @xmath21 where the sum is over all reciprocal lattice vector @xmath3 s of the simulation box such that @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24/2v_f\\ ] ] is a constant independent of the particle positions @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the first term on the right - hand side of eq .   is the only configuration - dependent contribution to the potential energy @xmath26 since @xmath27 and @xmath28 , eq .",
    "shows that @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , if configurations such that @xmath30 exist , then they are the classical ground states of this potential .",
    "these configurations are achieved by constraining @xmath31 to zero for all @xmath32 and are said to be stealthy up to @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath31 is related to the structure factor @xmath2 by @xmath33 for every @xmath34 , constraining @xmath31 to zero is equivalent to constraining @xmath2 to zero .",
    "let @xmath35 be half the number of @xmath3 points in the summation of eq .",
    "@xcite ; the parameter @xmath36 determines the degree to which the ground states are constrained and therefore the degeneracy and disorder of the ground states @xcite . for a fixed @xmath5 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the density @xcite . when @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a dimension - dependent constant , all the constraints are indeed satisfiable , thus @xmath39 of the classical ground states is zero @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 values we study in this paper are always less than @xmath38 .    in this section",
    "we choose @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the relatively small choice of @xmath11 increases the precision of the ground states we find .",
    "we will see that high precision is important in extracting an analytical model from numerical results .",
    "the constant @xmath5 and the magnitude of @xmath20 simply set the length scale and the energy scale .",
    "although the function form of @xmath20 could theoretically affect the probability of sampling different parts of the ground - state manifold , it does not affect the manifold itself @xcite . as explained in ref .",
    ", we use a rhombic simulation box with a @xmath43 interior angle to alleviate finite - size effect .",
    "the ground states reported in this section are produced by the following steps .    1 .",
    "start from a poisson ( i.e. , ideal gas ) initial configuration .",
    "2 .   minimize @xmath39 [ in eq .  ] using the low - storage bfgs algorithm @xcite .",
    "3 .   minimize @xmath39 using the minop algorithm @xcite .",
    "if @xmath44 , we successfully find a relatively high - precision ground state .",
    "otherwise , what we find is either an imprecise ground state or a local minimum of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we discard this configuration .    as detailed in ref .  , the low - storage bfgs algorithm is the fastest in minimizing @xmath39 , while the minop algorithm finds the most precise ground states .",
    "therefore , we minimize @xmath39 using these two algorithms consecutively to maximize both efficiency and precision .",
    "these steps are performed @xmath45 times for a variety of simulation box side lengths ( and therefore a variety of @xmath7 s ) , listed in table  [ nt ] @xcite . as detailed in ref .  , for a finite system , only certain values of @xmath7 are allowed .",
    "the @xmath7 values in table  [ nt ] contain all possible choices in the range @xmath46 , which covers the previously reported stacked - slider phase regime in two dimensions , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "except for @xmath48 , where we could not precisely identify ground states , we plot the real - space configuration and reciprocal - space structure factor of at least 50 successful energy minimized results and visually inspect them .",
    "we divide them into different categories based on their appearances and then present representative configurations below .    .the",

    "the numerical results suggested analytical models of this phase in two , three and higher dimensions . utilizing this model , we estimated the size of the feasible region of the stacked - slider phase , finding it to be smaller than that of crystal structures in the infinite - system - size limit , which is consistent with our recent previous work @xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", we also determined exact expressions for the pair correlation function and structure factor of the analytical model of stacked - slider phases , and analyzed the connectedness of the ground - state manifold of stealthy potentials in this density regime .",
    "our analytical constructions demonstrate that stacked - slider phases are nonperiodic , statistically anisotropic structures that possess long - range orientational order but have zero shear modulus .",
    "since stacked - slider phases are part of the ground - state manifold of stealthy potentials , they are also hyperuniform . therefore , stacked - slider phases are distinguishable states of matter that are uniquely different from some common states of matter listed in table  [ phases ] .",
    "note that distinctions between the attributes indicated in the table may be subtly different .",
    "for example , crystals , quasicrystals , and stacked - slider phases all have long - range orientational order , but with different symmetries . while crystals can only have twofold , threefold , fourfold , or sixfold rotational symmetries , quasicrystals have prohibited crystallographic rotational symmetries .",
    "stacked - slider phases generally do not have any rotational symmetry , but the fact that they can be constructed by stacking lower - dimensional stealthy configurations in a higher - dimensional space makes the stacking directions different from the sliding directions , giving them their unique orientational order .",
    "our understanding of stacked - slider phases is only in its infancy with many open questions .",
    "for example , what is the nature of the associated excited states ? can stacked - slider phases emerge from particles interacting with other potentials not necessarily as ground states ?",
    "can such phases be entropically favored in some ensemble and with what other phases would it coexist ?",

    "as discussed in sec .  [ model2 ] , each two - dimensional stacked - slider configuration is connected to a permutation of the rectangular lattice . therefore , a natural question is whether or not these permutations of the rectangular lattice are also connected through sliding motions .",
    "if all permutations of the rectangular lattice are connected , then the entire stacked - slider phase ground - state manifold is connected .",
    "we will show that , for a rectangular lattice consisting of @xmath51 rows and @xmath52 columns of particles , if each row and each column can slide individually , then all permutations of the rectangular lattice are connected if and only if @xmath53 is even .",
    "we will number all the particles from 1 to @xmath53 .",
    "each permutation will be represented by an @xmath54 matrix .",
    "three different sliding motions will be frequently used in this section .",
    "they are as follows :    * move the top row of particles to the right by one particle spacing , denoted by @xmath55 ; * move the leftmost column of particles upward by one particle spacing , denoted by @xmath56 ; * and move the leftmost column of particles downward by one particle spacing , denoted by @xmath57 .    as an example of this notation , for @xmath58 , permutations @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "are connected because @xmath61 similarly , permutations @xmath59 and @xmath62 are connected because @xmath63 so far we have demonstrated that it is possible to swap the two adjacent particles in the first row [ by eq .  ] or the two adjacent particles in the first column [ by eq .  ] for @xmath58 .",
    "since the system has translational symmetry , one can swap any two adjacent particles .",
    "the swapping of any two nonadjacent particles can be done by a series of adjacent - particle swapping .",
    "for example , to swap nonadjacent particles 1 and 4 in @xmath59 , one can swap particles 1 and 2 , then swap particles 1 and 4 , and then swap particles 2 and 4 .",
    "finally , since we can swap any two particles , we can connect one permutation to any other permutation by swapping each particle with the particle in its new place .",
    "therefore , all permutations of @xmath64 rectangular lattices are connected by row - sliding and column - sliding movements .",
    "next , we show that one can swap two adjacent particles for @xmath65 and @xmath66 . to swap the first two particles in the first row",
    ", one can perform the following sliding operations : @xmath67 to swap the first two particles in the first column , one can perform the following sliding operations starting from the third - to - last configuration in eq .  :",
    "@xmath68    equations  and   shows the steps to swap the first two particles in the first row , or the first two particles in the first column , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this can be generalized to any @xmath69 and any even @xmath70 .",
    "the generalization to @xmath69 is more obvious because the same steps can be directly applied to any @xmath51 and achieve the same goal .",
    "the generalization to larger even @xmath52 is less obvious . for this case",
    ", one needs to repeat the first four operations in eq .",
    "@xmath71 times and then perform the rest of the steps in eq .   or  . since it is possible to swap any two adjacent particles for any",
    "@xmath51 and any even @xmath52 , from the same argument as the @xmath58 case , all permutations of particles for any @xmath51 and any even @xmath52 are also connected .",
    "similarly , all permutations of particles for any even @xmath51 and any @xmath52 are also connected because a @xmath72 rotation turns it to the even @xmath52 case .",
    "therefore , all permutations are connected as long as @xmath53 is even .    when @xmath53 is odd , not all permutations are connected .",
    "this is because none of the sliding operations change the parity of the permutation .",
    "thus , two permutations with different parity can not be connected with any combinations of sliding operations .",
