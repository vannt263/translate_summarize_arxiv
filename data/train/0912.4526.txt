    "typically , the vast number of parameters is reduced by using heuristic mixing rules for the cross interactions ( @xmath13 ) so that the only remaining parameters are the diagonal coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the common mixing rules are @xmath16 , and either @xmath17 , constituting the lorentz - berthelot ( lb ) mixing rules , or @xmath18 , defining the geometric mixing rules @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the force fields take implicitly into account the polarizability , as well as many - body effects .",
    "in fact , potentials which account for electric polarizability do not strictly seem to be required for modeling ion pairing : it has been shown , that for mono- and divalent ions even the first hydration shell is not significantly polarized compared to water molecules in the bulk @xcite , though it should be kept in mind that a force field with more parameters has the principal possibility to be more accurate . for",

    ", there have been numerous attempts to systematically optimize ionic force fields . in principle , to properly describe the interactions between ions and between ions and water , a high level of quantum theory is required , which however turns out to be computationally too demanding for many - ion systems . because of this , but also due to the weak computer power in the early days of force field development , it has become a common habit to parametrize the empirical force fields of ions based on single ion properties , such as ion solvation free energies or hydration structure in small water clusters ,",
    "see for example ref .",
    "force fields based on this procedure , though , often fail to reproduce realistically the ion - ion fluid structure and thermodynamics of the electrolytes at non vanishing concentrations , even for simple ionic solutions such as nacl @xcite . as has been recognized in the literature",
    ", there is a strong sensitivity of solution thermodynamics  @xcite and contact ion pairing  @xcite to small changes in the effective pair potential between the interacting ions .",
    "ion force field development is , thus , a difficult task and remains an active field of research  @xcite .",
    "recently , two studies have revisited and systematically explored single ion hydration free energies by scanning through a wide region of the lj parameter space @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this was triggered by the observation that while traditionally force field parameters have been adjusted in order to correctly reproduce single - ion free energies of solvation , one experimental observable is clearly not sufficient to unequivocally fix the two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in @xcite ,",
    "crystal lattice energies have been used as a second independent optimization target . in @xcite , the single - ion solvation entropy and the effective solution ion size ( as constructed from the ion - water radial distribution function )",
    "have been used , though the simultaneous optimization of two parameters , especially for the cations was problematic .",
    "it was seen that the three observables considered , namely the free energy of solvation , the entropy of solvation , and the effective ion size , roughly matched the experimental values on a whole curve in the @xmath0 parameter plane , not allowing to single out one of the cationic parameter combinations as truly optimal @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to nail down the final cationic parameter set by benchmarking to collective , thermodynamic solution properties such as the electrolyte activity or osmotic pressure .",
    "weerasinghe and smith introduced and carried out this idea for nacl solutions by reproducing kirkwood - buff ( kb ) integrals as determined by experiments , ensuring that a good representation of solution activity is obtained  @xcite .",
    "the same approach has been used recently to investigate the cation - specific binding with protein surface charges  @xcite .",
    "however , the parametrization , which involves a free fit parameter in the mixing rule , does not conserve the free energy of solvation of single ions .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question , whether one can _ simultaneously _ describe single ion properties ( such as the free energy of solvation ) and ion - pairing properties by choosing optimized parameters for @xmath0 alone or whether an additional parameter has to be introduced , e.g. in the form of a generalized mixing rule as was recently suggested  @xcite .",

    "the electrolyte structure at a given concentration , which forms an input to the virial equation , can be obtained directly from an md simulation or approximately , but with much less computational effort , from simulations with implicit solvent  @xcite or hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) integral equation theory  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the kb derived nacl force field  @xcite and a few alkali - cl force fields proposed by dang  @xcite could reproduce experimental osmotic coeffcients in spc / e water quite well , while others badly failed  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the failure of some of the force fields when considering ion - pairing properties did not become clear .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the optimization of ionic force fields based on single - ion and ion - pair thermodynamic properties , using the infinite - dilution solvation free energy and the finite - concentration electrolyte osmotic pressure as benchmarks . as for nacl",
    "reasonable force fields exist , we use for na@xmath1 and cl@xmath2 the parameters given by dang @xcite , and focus on the salts kcl , nai , kf , cscl , and csi in spc / e water and systematically vary the force fields of k@xmath1 , cs@xmath1 , f@xmath2 , and i@xmath2 . to satisfy the experimental ion solvation free energies ,",
    "we confine our search in lj parameter space to the experimental equi - solvation free energy lines in @xmath21 space as calculated previously  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not vary systematically the mixing rule and in most simulations use the lb mixing rules .",
    "we apply the procedure proposed by kalcher and dzubiella  @xcite to calculate the electrolyte osmotic coefficients at a finite concentration of 1 m for a wide range of lj parameters and compare to experiments .",
    "our calculations are accompanied by hnc integral equation calculations that allow to efficiently cover and investigate a wide range of electrolyte concentrations .",
    "we systematically explore ( a ) whether ionic force field optimization is possible consistently for both single ion solvation energies and collective electrolyte thermodynamics without loosening the parameter space constraint given by the mixing rule , and ( b ) how the thermodynamics of electrolyte solutions react to a change of the lj parameters along the equi - solvation free energy path . as a main result",
    ", this simultaneous optimization of the force field seems possible for the cations cs@xmath1 and @xmath22 , while for the anions i@xmath2 and f@xmath2 the results are less promising .",
    "this suggests that in the long run , and in order to consistently describe finite - concentration electrolyte thermodynamics , the mixing rules have to be modified and systematically optimized . by calculating osmotic coefficients for a solution of csi",
    "we also investigate the transferability of ion parameters for cs@xmath1 and i@xmath2 that have been separately optimized by matching osmotic coefficients for cscl and nai .",
    "modulo the previously mentioned restricting comments on the optimization of i@xmath2 parameters , ion parameters seem transferable in the sense that trends in the osmotic coefficients of certain ions also are found when those ions are assembled into different ion pairings .",
    "we perform atomistic simulations using the molecular dynamics ( md ) package gromacs @xcite in the ( @xmath23 ) canonical ensemble , for which the particle number @xmath24 , as well as the pressure @xmath25  bar and temperature @xmath26 are held constant using a berendsen barostat and thermostat @xcite .",
    "the simulation box is cubic , with an edge length of @xmath27 nm , and periodically repeated in all three dimension and includes explicit ions and a total number of about 2000 spc / e water molecules @xcite .",
    "finite size effects are not significant for these sizes , as shown by a previous study on similar systems and sizes @xcite . the three dimensional particle - mesh ewald sum is used for the electrostatics @xcite with a grid spacing in fourier space of @xmath28 nm in all three directions .",
    "we use an interpolation order of 4 , a distance cutoff of @xmath29 nm for the real - space interactions , and a relative strength of the electrostatic interaction at the cutoff of @xmath30 .",
    "typical times for the simulations for gathering statistics are 150 ns for low concentrations and 40 - 50 ns for moderate concentrations .",
    "five different salt solutions were simulated , cscl , kcl , nai , kf , and csi at densities of 0.3  m and 1  m with 12 and 39 pairs of ions in the solution , respectively . here , the concentration m denotes molarity ( mol / l ) .",
    "for the ions , charged and non - polarizable spheres were used interacting with the lj potential ( eq . [ eq : lj ] ) . for the spc / e water the lj parameters are @xmath31 ( kj / mol ) and @xmath32 ( nm ) and are assigned only to the oxygen molecule of water ( no parameters are related to the two hydrogen atoms ) .",
    "point charges of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assigned to the oxygen and hydrogen atoms , respectively .",
    "for the ions we varied both parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 and present the analysis in section [ sec : result ] . only for sodium ( na@xmath37 ) and chloride ( cl@xmath38 )",
    "we used fixed parameters , those given by dang @xcite , as they have been proven to be consistent in determining thermodynamic properties @xcite and give reasonable hydration energies  @xcite .",
    "the lj parameters are for na@xmath1 , @xmath39 ( kj / mol ) and @xmath40 ( nm ) and for cl@xmath2 , @xmath41 ( kj / mol ) and @xmath42 ( nm ) . in this notation ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath43 denote the parameters between ion _",
    "i _ and the oxygen atom of the spc / e water model . for the cross interactions between two ions we use the lorentz - berthelot mixing rules ( except where noted otherwise ) .",

    "the parameters of this force field are for na@xmath1 , @xmath44 ( kj / mol ) and @xmath45 ( nm ) and for cl@xmath2 , @xmath46 ( kj / mol ) and @xmath47 ( nm ) .",
    "that force field involves a modified mixing rule for the relation between ion - ion and ion - water interaction , as it was not possible to fit the experimental data without breaking the geometric mixing rule  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the derivation of the effective ionic ( infinite dilution ) pair potentials for the salts studied here , for more details see @xcite .",
    "the pair potentials are derived from the radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) obtained within finite - concentration md simulations .",
    "the rdf between a pair of atoms or ions @xmath5 and @xmath6 at distance @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 at a given salt concentration @xmath50 .",
    "the potential of mean force ( pmf ) @xmath51 at concentration @xmath50 results from the rdf through a boltzmann inversion @xcite : @xmath52=\\beta \\big[w_{ij}^{sr}(r;\\rho)+w_{ij}^{lr}(r;\\rho)\\big ] , \\label{eq : pmf}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the inverse thermal energy .",
    "the pmf can be decomposed into a short - ranged and a long - ranged contribution , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the long - ranged part of the pmf is a non - specific debye - hckel potential and can be subtracted from @xmath51 leading in this way to the short - ranged part of the pair potential as detailed previously  @xcite , @xmath56 in the low concentration limit , the pmf between two ions reduces to their effective pair potential and the decomposition described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmf ] ) can be written as : @xmath57 where the potential is split into the short - ranged part of the pair potential , @xmath58 , and the usual coulombic part . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath59 are the valencies for the two ion types , respectively , and @xmath60 is the concentration dependent bjerrum length with an infinite - dilution ( pure water ) value of @xmath61  nm for spc / e water ( about 10% larger than the real water value ) @xcite . the key assumption of our derivation is now that the short - ranged part of the pair potential , @xmath62 , can be extracted from the finite concentration pmf , @xmath63 , as calculated in ( 3 ) , at not too high concentration .",
    "this is a good approximation , as long as the density is smaller than the density where the hydration layers of ions begin to overlap , which has been found to be betwen 0.5 and 1 m  @xcite . on empirical grounds , the above procedure for",
    "the derivation of the ionic pair potentials works well for rdfs generated at a finite concentration of @xmath64  m. here , @xmath65 is well fulfilled and accurate rdfs can be sampled with good statistics  @xcite . in the following , the total effective pair potential @xmath66 is used as an input to the pressure calculations by the virial route and as an input to the hnc method .",
    "the optimization of the ionic force fields for the salts studied in this work is done by comparing the derived osmotic coefficients to their experimental values .",
    "we use the virial route to calculate osmotic coefficients as was done previously  @xcite .",
    "the osmotic pressure @xmath68 of the ionic solution is defined through the osmotic coefficient @xmath67 at a concentration @xmath50 .",
    "the osmotic coefficient is given through the virial equation  @xcite : @xmath69 where the indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the two salt components and @xmath49 needs to be evaluated at the respective concentration .",
    "the virial route , as implemented in this work , is not exact as it employs the infinite dilution pair potential @xmath70 .",
    "accordingly , many - body contributions to the ion - ion interactions for higher densities as induced by the water are not included .",
    "it has been suggested , though , that many - body contributions to the pair - potential can be qualitatively included by taking into account the concentration dependence of the water dielectric constant @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus , the long - range part in the pair potential @xmath66 has to be altered by using @xmath71 instead of the infinite dilution limit @xmath72 .",
    "the following correction has been shown to lead to agreement of the virial route with the exact compressibility route up to a concentration of roughly @xmath73  m @xcite : @xmath74   \\label{eq : pmf_corr}\\ ] ] where again @xmath75 is the bjerrum length in the aqueous electrolyte solution of concentration @xmath50 , and @xmath76 for spc / e water @xcite , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",

    "interestingly , both k@xmath1 give comparable results for @xmath81 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : phis1m]b , meaning that the redundancy found with kcl seems to be also present for kf .",
    "however , none of the kf parameters reproduces experimental values for @xmath81 , so we chose a single force field for f@xmath2 that shows the least deviation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmfs ] , pmfs for the optimal parameters are compared with a pmf of a non - optimal lj parameter set .",
    "as expected , for cs@xmath1 and k@xmath1 the cation - anion pmf of the non - optimal force field shows larger deviations from the optimal force field results ; for i@xmath2 all anion - cation pmfs are quite similar .",
    "we briefly return to the discussion on peak heights and ion pairing  @xcite .",
    "for the optimal force fields in table  [ tab : optim ] , we find for the height of the first contact peak in the rdfs at 0.3  m concentration , values of about 9.5 and 5.5 for k@xmath80cl , and k@xmath82cl , respectively ; 14.8 and 8.6 for cs@xmath83cl and cs@xmath84cl , respectively ; about 2.3 for both nai@xmath85 and nai@xmath86 , respectively , and 3.3 for k@xmath79f@xmath80 .",
    "the order of the peak height is kcl @xmath3 cscl @xmath87 kf @xmath87 nai , consistent with previous theories on ion pairing @xcite , according to which the tendency to form direct ion pairs goes down as the ion sizes become more dissimilar .",
    "we note that this ordering of contact pair formation probability is only realized for the optimized force fields , non optimal force field combinations can easily lead to partial or complete reversal of this ordering .",
    "we so far were occupied with finding force field parameters that match experimental osmotic coefficients best .",
    "we now turn to a separate question and check whether the optimized force fields presented in the previous section are transferable . to that end , we perform a set of md simulations for csi in water , for which the parameters for cs@xmath1 and i@xmath2 are taken to be the optimized force fields from table [ tab : optim ] .",
    "the hope can be not be to match experimental osmotic coefficients for csi perfectly , as the iodide parameters are not perfect by themselves ( when compared with experimental osmotic coefficient data for nai ) .",
    "rather , we intend to check whether the trends of the simulated osmotic coefficients of csi reflect the properties of the cs@xmath1 and i@xmath2 force fields .",
    "the specific salts modeled are cs6i4 and cs9i4 ( we did not check the i@xmath85 parameter set , as variations of iodide parameters do not seem to considerably affect the osmotic coefficients , as was seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : phis1 m ] for nai ) .",
    "the md and hnc results for the osmotic coefficient are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiscsi_nacl](a ) .",
    "note that for cs6i4 we only show the md data for 0.3 m , since the simulation data at 1 m show bad convergence behavior , probably due to the vicinity to the crystalization transition for this particular force field ( note that experimentally csi has the smallest maximal solubility of all considered salts in this paper , of about 3 m , so such problems might be anticipated ) .",
    "we find overall good agreement between the md and hnc results with deviations in @xmath81 smaller than 0.05 .",
    "there are quite sizeable deviations between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data .",
    "however , note that we have used the optimized parameters for both cs@xmath1 and i@xmath2 , based on osmotic coefficients for cscl and nai , and that the deviations from experimental data for csi in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiscsi_nacl](a ) are of the same order as the deviations observed for cscl and nai in fig .",
    "[ fig : phis1 m ] .",
    "furthermore , the deviations from experimental data go in the expected direction , namely , the simulation prediction for cs6i4 lies below the experimental value , while cs9i4 lies above ( similar to the data for cs6cl and cs9cl in fig .",
    "[ fig : phis1m]a ) .",
    "we tentatively conclude from these data that the force fields obtained by our optimization strategy are transferable , meaning that if one fixes the force fields of ions a@xmath1 and d@xmath2 by optimizing the osmotic coefficients of the salts ab and cd , the osmotic coefficient of the salt ad should come out approximately right without further adjustment .",
    "such reasoning of course assumes that one can optimize the salts ab and cd and therefore does not apply to f@xmath2 , where the optimization of kf fails in the first place .",
    "so one sees that while optimization and transferability are logically distinct operations , transferability presumes successful optimization of force field parameters .",
    "we will come back to this point in the conclusions .    as an additional check of our methodology",
    ", we also used a different force field for nacl that was designed to reproduce experimentally determined kirkwood - buff integrals ( and thus experimental activity coefficients ) @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations with those nacl parameters using the mixing rules proposed , namely geometric mixing including a freely adjusted mixing coefficient ( and not the lorentz - berthelot rule which we were using up to this point ) .",
    "the md and hnc results for the osmotic coefficient are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phiscsi_nacl](b ) , together with the experimental data and those derived previously from the nacl dang parameters  @xcite .",
    "it is evident from this figure that the kirkwood - buff nacl force fields  @xcite give good agreement with experimental values for the osmotic coefficient , indicating that activity coefficient and osmotic coefficient data probe the same ionic features , namely the pairing characteristics in aqueous solution .",
    "we have used a combination of md simulations and statistical mechanics analysis to systematically explore and optimize force field parameters for ions in aqueous solution , with particular emphasis on the interplay of single - ion and ion - pair thermodynamics .",
    "the ion parameters considered by us , namely the lennard - jones radius and strength , were confined to a curve on which the experimental single ion solvation free energy is reproduced  @xcite . for a whole number of specific force fields on those curves , we constructed effective ionic pair potentials which led , through the virial route , to electrolyte osmotic coefficients .",
    "these were then compared to experimental values at 1  m concentration .",
    "we have used the md - virial route derived osmotic coefficients to optimize the lj parameters for the single ions cs@xmath1 ,",
    "k@xmath1 , i@xmath2 , and f@xmath2 based on data for cscl , kcl , nai , and kf , respectively , treating na@xmath1 and cl@xmath2 as reference ions .",
    "this optimization strategy works well for the cations cs@xmath1 and k@xmath1 , for which we obtain , due to the peculiar shape of the md - based osmotic coefficient curves , two optimized force fields for each ion .",
    "this proves that at least for the cations , the simultaneous description of single - ion and ion - pairing thermodynamics is possible if one systematically explores the full lj parameter space without the need to modify the combination rules . for anions , on the other hand ,",
    "the optimization is more problematic",
    ". we could not get reasonable match of experimental osmotic coefficient data varying the lj parameters of f@xmath2 in kf , simply because the maximum in the simulated osmotic coefficient is significantly below the experimental value .",
    "iodide can be more or less satisfactorly optimized based on nai data , but this seems to be mere coincidence , since nai osmotic coefficients shows very little dependence on the lj parameter , which indicates a basic limitation of our approach . with these restrictions in mind , we checked for the transferability of our optimized force fields by considering the osmotic coefficient of a csi solution , i.e. an ion combination that was not targeted in the optimization process .",
    "based on the far - from - perfect performance of the i@xmath2 force field in nai , we judge the transferability properties of the force fields as satisfactory since in particular the trends of the cscl osmotic coefficients upon variations of the cs@xmath1 force field are fully recovered when looking at the trends of the csi osmotic coefficients .",
    "these results suggest that for truly accurate non - polarizable ion parameters , one apparently needs to lift the constraint of the simple mixing rules and introduce an additional scaling parameter in the mixing rule , in agreement with previous approaches @xcite .",
    "however , it seems desirable and possible to introduce such a mixing parameter only in the cation - anion interaction , so that the anion - water and the cation - water interactions stay the same as used in the single - ion solvation free energy optimization ( the cation - cation and anion - anion interactions are much less important ) .",
    "that way , one would correctly describe the single - ion properties ( as embodied in the infinite - dilution solvation free energy ) as well as ion - pairing properties ( as important for osmotic and activity coefficients ) . as an unfortunate byproduct",
    ", one would have to optimize this mixing parameter for each ion pair , requiring substantial simulation efforts .",

    "<S> optimization of the force field is achieved for the cations cs@xmath1 and k@xmath1 , while for the anions i@xmath2 and f@xmath2 the experimental osmotic coefficient can not be reached . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that in the long run , additional parameters might have to be introduced into the modeling , for example by modified mixing rules . </S>"
