    "photoionization of atoms and molecules is a fundamental physical process , which has been studied for many years .",
    "accurate solution of continuum states is an essential task in the various quantum mechanical problems , such as the calculation of multiphoton ionization , above - threshold ionization ( ati ) , and electron scattering .",
    "however , the wavefunctions of continuum states oscillate to infinity . as a result",
    ", it is not as easy as the calculations of bound states .",
    "there are a number of methods to calculate the resonance states , such as complex scaling method , r - matrix method .",
    "however , they are not used to calculate continuum state with any positive energy .",
    "although variational method @xcite and least - squares schemes @xcite have been introduced in the calculation of continuum wavefunctions , efficient and accurate solutions are still necessary . in general",
    ", a variational approach can be used to calculate all the eigenstates of any quantum system using some appropriate basis set . after direct diagonalization of a hamiltonian matrix for appropriate potentials , all the eigenvalues and wavefunctions are obtained .",
    "negative eigenvalues correspond to bound states , while positive eigenvalues correspond to the continuum states . however , this method is not efficient for large scale matrix problems involving large basis sets for convergence and high accuracy . in any standard matrix diagonalization program ,",
    "the demand on computer memory grows as @xmath1 and the cpu time as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the size of the hamiltonian matrix)@xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 , the computation becomes very slow , even impractical in some cases .",
    "in addition , the obtained discrete continuum states may not be what we want because we do nt know their boundary conditions . for certain chemical and physical problems , not all the eigenstates of a system",
    "are required .",
    "for example , to numerically solve time - dependent schrdinger equations ( tdse ) , one only needs the initial wavefunction , and then propagates it under a hamiltonian including time - dependent interaction terms by using general split - operator methods ( som)@xcite , crank - nicolson methods ( c - n method)@xcite , or efficient large vector matrix operations@xcite .",
    "if the initial state in a simulation is the ground state , one does not need to diagonalize a basis set dependent hamiltonian , but one propagates a tdse for an arbitrary initial vector by an imaginary - time - propagation method ( itp method)@xcite .",
    "complex time steps also allow to obtain higher order accuracy in som@xcite . in this paper , we show that itp method based on c - n scheme can be generalized to converge to bound exited and unbound continuum states by changing time step . to our knowledge , this has not been reported . the itp calculations and time - dependent calculations based on c - n method",
    "agree very well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the principle of itp method for excited and continuum states is presented in sec .",
    "the application of the itp method in photoionization of one - electron diatomic molecular ion h@xmath5 and heh@xmath6 is shown in sec .",
    "[ iii ] . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , we illustrate the application of the proposed itp method in two - electron systems .",
    "the paper concludes in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce next the principle of usual itp method for ground state and our proposed itp method based on c - n scheme for all the bound and continuum states .",
    "the principle of the itp method can be found as follows . for a general tdse ( atomic units , a.u .",
    ", @xmath7 are used unless otherwise specified ) , @xmath8 introducing the imaginary time @xmath9 in an itp method , and if the hamiltonian @xmath10 is time - independent , then the new time - dependent wavefunction after a time step @xmath11 can be written as : @xmath12 expanding an initial arbitrary wavefunction @xmath13 as a linear combination of the time - independent eigenstates @xmath14 of @xmath10 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , then eq .  ( [ e2 ] )",
    "can be written as : @xmath17    it is obvious that higher energy states will exponentially decay as a function of @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) , at a rate which is faster than for the lower energy states .",
    "after sufficiently long time evolution , any arbitrary initial wavefunction will thus converge to the ground state .",
    "if we are interested in an excited state @xmath19 , we have to at first obtain the converged ground state @xmath20 and other lower excited states @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , then project out all the lower energy states by @xmath23 from the initial state before evolution@xcite . for higher excited states ,",
    "this method becomes slowly convergent and difficult to apply .",
    "it is even not practical for continuum states due to the large degeneracy of those states .    ) and eq .",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=188 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , based on the crank - nicolson numerical method , we present in this work an extension of the itp method @xmath9 for directly converging an arbitrary initial vector to desired bound excited states by controlling the time step size .",
    "it is different from the usual itp methods which can only converge directly to the ground state . to obtain converged excited state , the usual itp methods require filtering out all lower bound states from the initial state . for continuum states with positive energies",
    ", we generalize the imaginary propagation method by @xmath25 , and show convergence of any arbitrary state to desired continuum states .",
    "this method is proven to be simple and accurate for small number of iterations @xmath26 or total time @xmath27 .",
    "the application of this itp method in the photoionization of diatomic molecules is illustrated .",
    "this method can also be used in two - electron systems .",
    "we emphasize that this c - n method is a systematic method to study ultrafast dynamics . after obtaining the initial bound state by c - n itp ,",
    "then the c - n method can be used to solve tdse in real time space .",
    "after the interactions between intense ultrashort laser pulses and atoms and molecules , the energy and momentum information of the photoelectrons can be extracted from the time - dependent wave functions@xcite by projecting on the continuum states obtained by itp .",
    "this new method can be directly extended to complex system@xcite , confined systems@xcite , dirac equations@xcite , multiparticle states@xcite and also in tddft methods@xcite for complex molecular systems .",
