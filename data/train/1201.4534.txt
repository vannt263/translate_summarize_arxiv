    "motor proteins are molecular machines that convert chemical energy into mechanical work by atp hydrolysis .",
    "they `` walk '' on the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton and pull vesicles and organelles across the cell @xcite .",
    "motor proteins can be classified into processive and non - processive motors .",
    "the former class includes motors like kinesins , which travel a long distance along their cytoskeleton track ( microtubules ) without detachment @xcite . in the latter class ,",
    "we find motors like myosins that make only a single step along their tracks ( actin filaments ) before disconnection @xcite .",
    "while processive motors can move cargoes by operating individually , non - processive motors need to work in cooperation to generate substantial movement . cooperative action of myosin motors is implicated in a variety of cellular processes , including the contraction of the contractile ring during cytokinesis @xcite , adaptation of mechanically activated transduction channels in hair cells in the inner ear @xcite , and muscle contraction @xcite .",
    "another important example of cooperative motor dynamics is found in motility assays , where filaments glide over a surface densely covered by motor proteins @xcite .",
    "one of the more interesting outcomes of cooperative action of molecular motors is their ability to induce bidirectional motion .",
    "bidirectional motion is observed when a filament is subjected to the action of two groups of motors that engage in a `` tug - of - war '' contest and exert forces in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the motor party that exerts the larger force determines the instantaneous direction of motion , which is reversed when the balance of forces shifts from one group to the other .",
    "earlier theoretical models suggested that that the characteristic reversal time of the bidirectional dynamics ( i.e. , the typical duration of the unidirectional intervals of motion ) , @xmath0 , grows exponentially with the number of motors @xmath1 @xcite . in these earlier models ,",
    "the moving filament was treated as a rigid rod which does not induce elastic coupling between the motors . a recent motility assay of myosin ii motors and actin filaments with alternating polarities challenged this prediction .",
    "it was found that the characteristic reversal times of the bidirectional motion in this motility assay were macroscopically large , but practically independent of the number of motors @xcite .",
    "this observation has been explained by a model that accounts for the elasticity of the actin filament @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the motors indirectly interact with each other via the tensile stress that they generate in the elastic filament .",
    "the elasticity - mediated crosstalk between the motors leads to a substantial increase in their unbinding rates , making each motor effectively less processive and eliminating the exponential growth of @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the duty ratio ( the fraction of time that each motor spends attached to the filament track ) of the cooperative motors can be explained as follows : during bidirectional motion , the elastic filament is subjected to a tug - of - war between motors that exert opposite forces , which leads to large stress fluctuations along the elastic filament .",
    "these stress fluctuations are the origin of the elasticity - mediated crosstalk effect .",
    "detailed analysis shows that the typical elastic energy stored in the actin filament scales as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the number of motors , @xmath3 is the number of _ connected _ motors , and @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter ( which is closely related to the parameter @xmath5 , to be defined below in eq .",
    "[ eq : betastar ] ) . for actin - myosin ii systems",
    ", @xmath4 is rather small ( for the motility assay described in ref .",
    "@xcite ,  @xmath6 ) ; but the energy released upon the detachment of a single motor ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 , can be quite large if @xmath1 is large .",
    "this last result implies that for large @xmath1 , the transitions of motors between the attached and detached states are influenced by both atp - driven ( out - of - equilibrium ) processes as well as by thermal ( equilibrium ) excitations .",
    "the latter will be dominated by the changes in the elastic energy of the actin ( see eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] ) and not by the energy of the individual motors .    for the actin filament with alternating polarities ,",
    "the elasticity - mediated crosstalk is a cooperative effect that reduces the degree of cooperativity between motors ( decreases @xmath0 ) by decreasing their duty ratio ( i.e. , their attachment probability ) .",
    "but as discussed above , much of the strength of this effect is related to the large stress fluctuations that develop in the elastic filament due to the opposite forces applied by the antagonistic motors . in view of this fact , it is fair to question the significance of this effect in the more common situation where polar filaments move directionally under the action of a single family of motor proteins . in this work",
    "we analyze this problem and show that the elasticity - mediated crosstalk effect in this system is indeed much smaller , but not entirely negligible .",
    "our analysis of this effect is presented in the following section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the magnitude of this effect in acto - myosin systems is estimated in section  [ sec : amsys ] .",
    "in what follows we model the elastic actin filament as a chain of @xmath1 equally spaced nodes connected by @xmath9 identical springs with spring constant @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] ) . in the chain reference frame ,",
    "the @xmath11-th node is located at @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the spacing between the nodes .",
    "for brevity we set @xmath15 .",
    "the chain lies on a `` bed '' of motors , where each node may be either free and experience no pulling force ( @xmath16 ) , or attached to one motor in which case it is subjected to a force of magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "different configurations of the system are defined according to which nodes are connected to motors and which are not . for a given configuration @xmath18 , the elastic energy of the chain is given by the sum of energies of the springs : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the force applied on the @xmath11-th spring .",
    "the forces @xmath20 are calculated as follows : we first calculate the mean force @xmath21 , and define the excess forces acting on the nodes : @xmath22 .",
    "the force on the @xmath11-th spring is then obtained by summing the excess forces applied on all the monomers located on one side of the spring : @xmath23 .",
    "it is more convenient to analyze the problem using continuous functions .",
    "let us introduce the function @xmath24 which , for @xmath25 , has slope @xmath26 if the monomer at @xmath27 is connected to a motor , and a slope 0 , otherwise .",
    "thus , @xmath24 gives the total force applied on the chain up to the point @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath3 is the number of monomers connected to motors in a given configuration .",

    "[ fig : hg ] and gives the total _ excess _ force accumulated up to @xmath28 .",

    ", one needs to calculate the partition function @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the attachment probability , i.e.  duty ratio , of a single motor , and @xmath38 is the partition function of all the configurations with exactly @xmath3 connected motors .",
    "the function @xmath38 can be calculated by tracing over all the functions @xmath39 corresponding to configurations with @xmath3 connected motors .",
    "mathematically , the condition that exactly @xmath3 motors are connected can be expressed through the following constraint on the function @xmath24 .",

    "[ eq : betastar ] relates the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 to three physical parameters of the system - the temperature @xmath83 , the typical force exerted by the motors @xmath84 , and the effective spring constant of the actin filaments segment between between two binding sites of the motors , @xmath10 .",
    "the latter parameter can be further expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is young s modulus of the actin , @xmath87 is the cross - sectional area of an actin filament and @xmath88 is the distance between binding sites . for myosin ii motors , forces in the range of @xmath89 pn have been measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "the actin - cross sectional area ( including the tropomyosin wrapped around the actin helix ) is @xmath90 , and the young s modulus of the actin - tropomyosin filament is @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath88 is somewhat more difficult to assess .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath92 nm , which is simply the size of the g - actin monomers , each of which includes one binding site for myosin motors @xcite .",
    "another possible value is related to the double helical structure of f - actin and the fact that it completes half a twist about every 7 monomers , i.e.  every @xmath93 nm @xcite .",
    "since the binding sites follow a twisted spatial path along the double helix , many of them remain spatially unavailable to the motors . in the motility assay ,",
    "the motors are located underneath the f - actin , and the distance between the binding sites along the line of contact with the bed of motors is @xmath94 nm .",
    "a third choice for @xmath88 , which may be more relevant to skeletal muscles , is @xmath95 nm . this value is derived from the fact that within the sarcomere ( the basic contractile unit of the muscle ) an average number of three thick myosin filaments surround one thin actin filament .",
    "the separation between collinear motor heads along the thick filament is @xmath96 nm @xcite , and because the actin is surrounded by three thick filaments , the distance between the motors _ along the actin _ is @xmath97 nm .    for the duty ratio @xmath37 , the range of experimental values is scattered and varies from @xmath98 @xcite to @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty may be partially related to the elasticity cross - talk effect discussed here .",
    "it also stems from the fact that @xmath37 also depends on the distance and orientation of the motor head ( both in space and time ) with respect to the associated binding site .",
    "these may vary between the motors which , hence , should have different attachment probabilities @xcite .    using the above mentioned values of system parameters ,",
    "one finds that for acto - myosin systems the parameter @xmath5 lies within the range of @xmath99 . setting the duty ratio of myosin ii to @xmath81 ( as used in the mc simulations )",
    "we find that for this range of @xmath5 , the _ effective _ duty ratio is slightly lower than @xmath37 and lies within the range of @xmath100 ( for @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) .",
    "using a lower estimate for the duty ratio @xmath104 @xcite , we find that the effective duty ratio drops to @xmath105 for the same range of @xmath5 .",
    "as stated earlier , the cooperative action of myosin motors `` compensates '' for the non - processive character of the individual motors .",
    "the force generated by a group of @xmath1 motors is @xmath106 .",
    "which force @xmath84 maximizes the effective force per motor @xmath107 and , hence , the force production of the collectively working motors ? from eq .",
    "[ eq : betastar ] and  [ eq : peff2 ] we find that the maximum value of @xmath108 is achieved when the force of the individual motors is @xmath109 setting the values of the system parameters as above ( @xmath110 , @xmath90 , @xmath111 ) and taking @xmath104 as the duty ratio of a single motor , we find that @xmath112 , for which @xmath113 . for forces in the range of @xmath114 , which are typically measured for myosin ii motors @xcite ,",
    "the effective mean force per motor is @xmath115 , which is about half of the optimal effective force @xmath116 .",
    "we , thus , conclude that mysoin ii motors work quite close to conditions that maximize their cooperative force generation .",
    "there has recently been a considerable interest in the collective behavior of molecular motors , especially in relation to cooperative dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments in motility assays .",
    "most studies have focused on the bidirectional motion arising when the filament is driven by two groups of antagonistic motors , or in the case when one motor party works against an external force .",
    "the present work is motivated by our recent studies of bidirectional motion in acto - myosin motility assays which demonstrated that the duty ratio of the motors ( and , hence , the level of cooperativity between them ) is reduced by the elasticity of the actin backbone . in this paper",
    "we extended our studies to motility assays in which similar motors act on a polar actin filament without a counter external force . to single out the filament elasticity crosstalk from other possible collective effects ( e.g. , those associated with non - equilibrium atp - assisted processes and with the elasticity of the motors themselves @xcite ) ,",
    "we neglect motor - to - motor variations and use a model in which the motors are characterized by two mean quantities : their attachment probability to a rigid ( non - elastic ) filament @xmath37 , and the mean applied pulling force @xmath84 .",
    "we expect this mean field description of the motors to hold when the number of motors @xmath1 becomes large .",
    "we calculate the attachment probability to the elastic filament @xmath117 from the partition function associated with the filament elastic energy . the elastic energy of filament can be treated as an equilibrium degree of freedom ( of a system which is inherently out - of - equilibrium ) because the mechanical response of the filament to the attachment / detachment of motors occurs on time scales which are far shorter than the typical attachment time of the motors ( see discussion in ref .",
    "the assumption that the actin filament is in mechanical equilibrium is also made in theoretical studies of intracellular cargo transport @xcite and muscle constraction @xcite ) our calculation shows that @xmath77 is only slightly smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "this result is very different from our previous findings for motility assays of bidirectional motion , where the elasticity - mediated crosstalk effect is substantial .",
    "finally , we note that although in both this and previous studies we found that @xmath117 @xcite , the opposite relation can not be excluded under certain conditions ( e.g. , when the filament experiences external forces as in single molecule experiments or muscle contraction ) .",
    "we intend to address this opposite scenario in a future publication , in which we investigate the variations in both @xmath37 ( the atp - hydrolysis related attachment probability ) and @xmath77 ( which also includes the contribution due to the elastic crosstalk effect ) with the muscle contraction velocity .",
    "we thank anne bernheim and sefi givli for useful discussions .",
    "we model the actin filament as a linear chain of identical particles of mass @xmath118 connected by elastic ( massless ) springs with spring constant @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system2 ] ) .",
    "three types of forces are exerted on the particles : ( i ) the motor forces @xmath119 , ( ii ) the spring forces @xmath20 , and ( iii ) friction drag forces @xmath120 . because the motion is highly overdamped , the total instantaneous force on each mass vanishes . for the @xmath11-th mass ,",
    "the equation of is @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "the drag force includes two contributions - one is due to motor friction ( mf ) , @xmath123 , and the other due to friction with the viscous medium , @xmath124 .",
    "the motor friction forces act only on the particles which are connected to the motors .",
    "therefore , by redefining the motor forces @xmath125 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : overdamped ] as @xmath126 for the chain s center of mass ( com ) , the equation of motion reads @xmath127 but the viscous drag force is distributed uniformly along the chain ( i.e. , it is equal for all masses ) and , therefore , eq .",
    "[ eq : overdamped3 ] gives @xmath128 using this last result , eq .",
    "[ eq : overdamped2 ] reads @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the excess force . since @xmath131 , we find that @xmath132",

    "[ eq : final ] remains valid .                                                  in our statistical - mechanical analysis , @xmath37 represents the typical duty ratio of individual myosin ii motors , which are all assumed to have the same fixed @xmath37 .",
    "it is possible that accounting for the variations in @xmath37 in the model will result in a slight increase in the magnitude of the elasticity cross talk effect ."
