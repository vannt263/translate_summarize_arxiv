    "the interaction of matter with a light pulse sets electrons in motion .",
    "the associated dynamics frequently occur on time scales comparable to or smaller than a femtosecond .",
    "the time - domain observation of such fast phenomena was impossible until a few years ago , when the first pump - probe measurements with attosecond extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) pulses were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "since then , several types of attosecond spectroscopy have been established or proposed theoretically @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches employ an intense near - infrared ( nir ) laser pulse that either induces or probes dynamics of interest .",
    "combined with an euv pulse , an attosecond pump - probe measurement is performed by varying the delay between the pulses and observing the results of their interaction with a system under study .",
    "one of the most prominent examples is attosecond streaking @xcite , where photoelectron spectra are measured for a set of delays .",
    "attosecond streaking has proved to be a very powerful technique for measuring electron dynamics triggered by an attosecond pulse @xcite , but it is less suited to probing strong - field dynamics with an euv pulse .",
    "historically , the first time - resolved measurements of electron dynamics induced by a strong light field were performed with the aid of attosecond tunneling spectroscopy @xcite , where ions , rather than electrons , were measured for different delays between the euv and nir pulses .",
    "very recently , another promising technique_attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy_has been established : by measuring the transmission of an euv pulse through a gas ionized by an nir pulse , the motion of ionic valence - shell electrons has been observed with attosecond resolution @xcite .",
    "the earliest implementation of transient absorption spectroscopy for the study of ultrafast dynamics involved detecting the change in absorbance of a narrowband probe pulse as a function of pump - probe time delay @xcite . in experiments that elucidate ultrafast molecular dynamics , tuning the central wavelength of the probe pulse tracks the motion of the nuclear wave packet into and out of different regions of the excited - state potential energy surface .",
    "advances in laser pump - synchrotron probe techniques have allowed time - resolved x - ray absorption spectra to be collected in this fashion @xcite .",
    "mathies and shank introduced a variant of transient absorption spectroscopy in which the photoexcitation of a sample by an optical pump pulse is followed by probing with a spectrally broadband , few - cycle visible pulse @xcite .",
    "the probe pulse that is transmitted through the sample is spectrally dispersed by a spectrometer . in this method ,",
    "the time resolution is mainly determined by the duration of the pump and probe pulses , and it is independent of the spectral resolution .",
    "hence , compared to earlier approaches that employed narrowband probe pulses , spectrally resolved transient absorption spectroscopy with broadband probe pulses offers the obvious advantages of high time resolution and high spectral resolution . in the visible , state - of - the - art experiments on samples of biological relevance",
    "have been done with sub-5-fs pump and probe pulses @xcite .",
    "this technique has also been applied to femtosecond studies of novel materials @xcite . for an up - to - date summary of the development of the optical transient absorption technique ,",
    "see ref .",
    "recently , femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was extended to shorter probe wavelengths by employing laser - produced bremsstrahlung x - rays @xcite and euv high - order harmonics @xcite , as well as femtosecond synchrotron x - rays @xcite .",
    "transient absorption spectroscopy provided direct evidence for hole alignment in strong - field - generated atomic ions @xcite .",
    "the ion alignment dynamics driven by electron - ion collisions in a strong - field - generated plasma were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , it was not clear at the time whether strong - field ionization leads to the formation of a coherent superposition of ionic eigenstates ( in cases where not only the ionic ground state is populated ) .",
    "in other words , it was not clear whether strong - field - generated ions undergo any coherent intraatomic dynamics",
    ". theory indicated that it is generally not possible to describe strong - field - generated ions in terms of a perfectly coherent wave packet ; a description in terms of a density matrix is required @xcite .",
    "using transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with theory , the diagonal elements of the density matrix of strong - field - generated atomic ions were measured @xcite .",
    "the diagonal elements of the density matrix ( represented in the ionic eigenbasis ) are the populations of the various ionic eigenstates , generated by a strong nir field .",
    "the measurement of the entire ion density matrix  including the coherences , i.e. , the off - diagonal elements of the ion density matrix  was made possible by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy @xcite .    in the present paper , we develop a theoretical description of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong - field - generated ions .",
    "our approach allows us to treat the pump step , i.e. , the interaction with a strong nir field , in a completely nonperturbative fashion .",
    "we assume throughout that the attosecond euv probe pulse has no temporal overlap with the strong nir pump pulse . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we derive the basic expressions underlying the theory . the analysis of the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite becomes particularly transparent if it is assumed that the attosecond probe pulse remains sufficiently short as it propagates through the nir - modified target medium .",
    "this short - pulse approximation is discussed in sec .",
    "numerical euv pulse propagation calculations in sec .  [ sec4 ]",
    "allow us to assess the validity of the short - pulse approximation under the conditions of ref .",
    "the distortion of the nir pump pulse by the target medium is not considered .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] concludes .",
    "atomic units are used throughout , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we consider a semiclassical description of the interaction of the pump and probe pulses with the atoms in the target gas .",
    "both pulses are approximated by transverse , infinite plane waves propagating along the @xmath1 axis , and are assumed to be linearly polarized along the @xmath2 axis . as mentioned in the introduction , the nir pulse is assumed to remain unmodified as it propagates through the gas .",
    "thus , neglecting diffraction , the nir electric field may be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time measured in the laboratory frame and @xmath5 is the vacuum speed of light . for an atom at position @xmath1",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the local time @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in the electric dipole approximation , the hamiltonian for an atom at position @xmath1 reads @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the unperturbed atomic hamiltonian , @xmath9 is the atomic ground - state energy , @xmath10 is the @xmath2 component of the electric dipole operator , and @xmath11 is the euv electric field . in order to calculate the euv - induced polarization response of the atoms , we need to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath12",
    "let us assume we have solved the @xmath1-independent , nir - only problem @xmath13 a suitable initial condition for the time evolution operator is @xmath14 therefore , in the absence of the probe pulse , a solution to eq .",
    "is @xmath15 is the initial state of the atom , assumed to be the ground state .    in order to take into consideration the effect of the probe pulse",
    ", we make the ansatz @xmath16 is a correction that is of first order with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 this equation can be integrated analytically .",
    "the result reads @xmath19 .",
    "let us now calculate the polarization along the @xmath2 axis : @xmath20 in this expression , @xmath21 is the atomic number density , @xmath22 describes harmonic generation driven by the nir pulse ( no euv pulse present ) , and @xmath23 is the polarization correction to first order with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "using eq .  , the first - order polarization correction may be written as @xmath24 ] note that the integrand in eq .",
    "depends explicitly on @xmath25 via @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , even if the euv pulse may , effectively , be approximated by a delta function centered at , say , @xmath28 , the polarization induced by the euv pulse contains information not only on atomic properties at the instant of the euv pulse , but , in principle , also on atomic properties after the euv pulse ( for @xmath29 ) .",
    "as we will see , this causes no difficulty for the situation considered in this paper .",
    "we assume that the euv probe pulse comes after the nir pump pulse , so that the nir pulse does not affect the electronic states reached via euv photoabsorption .",
    "hence , we have , for the time evolution operator in eq .  , @xmath30 let @xmath31 denote an eigenstate of the unperturbed atomic hamiltonian @xmath8 with eigenenergy @xmath32 .",
    "we may then expand the nir - only state vector , after the nir pulse , as follows : @xmath33 are time - independent .",
    "thus , eq .   goes over into @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an eigenstate of @xmath8 with eigenenergy @xmath36 , which is , in general , assumed to be complex .",
    "more precisely , the imaginary part of @xmath36 is either zero or negative .",
    "we assume that the high harmonics generated by the nir pulse [ eq .  ]",
    "do not overlap with the spectral range of the euv pulse .",
    "hence , the propagation of the euv electric field through the medium can be described by the following scalar wave equation : @xmath37 with the fourier representations @xmath38 @xmath39 it follows from eq .",
    "that @xmath40 in the situation considered , the spatial derivative of the electric field amplitude at a given @xmath41 changes slowly over a wavelength @xmath42 .",
    "this allows us to neglect in eq .",
    "( [ eq13e ] ) the second derivative with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the differential equation governing the spatial evolution of @xmath43 reads @xmath44    equation ( [ eq13f ] ) can be integrated analytically if @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath43 : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the linear susceptibility . if eq .",
    "is valid , it follows from eq .",
    "that @xmath48 in the attosecond transient absorption experiment described in ref .",

    "( [ eq13a ] ) , ( [ eq13c ] ) , and ( [ eq13d ] ) , the fourier transform of the euv - induced polarization : @xmath52 therefore , the ratio @xmath53 is independent of the euv electric field  i.e .",
    ", a well - defined linear susceptibility is obtained  only if @xmath54 this condition is always satisfied if only terms with @xmath55 contribute to the polarization response in eq .  .",
    "generally , this is not the case .",
    "still , eq .   serves as a good approximation if the euv pulse is much shorter than @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , for beer s law to be rigorously applicable , this short pulse must not undergo any significant distortion as it propagates through the dense gas , so that the euv pulse remains short in comparison to the dynamical time scales characterizing the target medium prepared by the nir pump pulse . if eq .",
    "is not satisfied , the propagation equation must be solved numerically . in the following sections , we discuss both regimes in more detail .",
    "so far , our treatment of the electronic - structure problem has been general . in order to describe resonant euv absorption by laser - generated ions ,",
    "we now adopt the mean - field model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and write the nir - only state vector after the nir pulse in terms of slater determinants : @xmath58 in this approximation , the set @xmath59 contains the ground - state determinant @xmath60 and all particle - hole configurations @xmath61 obtained from @xmath60 by exciting or ionizing an electron from an occupied spin orbital @xmath62 ( a `` hole '' orbital ) to an unoccupied spin orbital @xmath63 ( a `` particle '' orbital ) @xcite .",
    "a particle - hole configuration corresponds to an excited or ionized electron plus an ion core with a hole in some shell that is fully occupied in the ground state of the neutral atom .",

    "@xcite ( see sec .  [ sec1 ] ) , which studied the structures in the euv absorption spectrum of strong - field - generated kr@xmath0 ions associated with exciting an inner - shell @xmath71 electron in kr@xmath0 into the outer - valence @xmath72 vacancy created by the nir pulse .",
    "resonant @xmath73 photoabsorption by the kr@xmath0 ion core was used to study the properties of the hole generated via strong - field ionization . since",
    "such transitions involve only hole orbitals , we refer to them as hole - hole transitions .",
    "the relevant transitions are indicated in fig .",
    "the transition energies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were calculated using the multiconfiguration dirac - fock program package grasp @xcite .",
    "the configurations that were included in the calculation are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "we neglect that the euv field might induce particle - particle transitions .",
    "this is an excellent approximation , because the nir - generated photoelectron interacts only weakly with the euv field .",
    "since the electron excited or ionized by the nir pulse is a spectator in the hole - hole transitions of the ion core , one can describe the ions with a reduced density matrix @xcite : @xmath79 where the summation is performed over all unoccupied orbitals . since we consider the regime where the nir and euv pulses do not overlap , the auxiliary matrix @xmath80 is time - independent .",
    "the polarization response of the ions to the field of the euv pulse can be expressed via the density matrix by inserting the ansatz for @xmath81 into eq .   and following the same steps in the derivation that led to eq .  .",
    "this yields @xmath82 here , the absorption of an euv photon fills a hole in orbital @xmath62 with an electron from orbital @xmath83 , which has the orbital energy @xmath84 .",
    "this process is described by the dipole matrix element @xmath85 .",
    "the second dipole matrix element , @xmath86 , describes the process upon which the hole created in orbital @xmath83 is filled by an electron from orbital @xmath87 .    in the following , we express the hole orbital energies in terms of ionization potentials , @xmath88 being defined as the minimum energy required to create an ion with a hole in orbital @xmath62 from a neutral atom in its ground state . furthermore , since @xmath89 , it is sufficient to calculate the polarization response only for positive frequencies . dropping the counter - rotating term in eq .   and using ionization potentials instead of orbital energies , we obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the decay width of the one - hole channel @xmath83 .",
    "we emphasize that eq .",
    "is valid only if the euv pulse comes after the nir pulse .",
    "recall also that the nir pulse is assumed to remain unmodified as it propagates through the gas .",
    "if we dropped this assumption , then the ion density matrix would depend explicitly on the atomic position @xmath1 along the nir pulse propagation axis .",
    "the computationally expensive electronic wave - packet problem ( [ eq3 ] ) would then have to be solved not only once , but for every grid point used in the discretization of @xmath1 .",
    "we now analyze the euv - induced polarization assuming that the probe field may be approximated by a delta function centered at @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93 within this approximation , the fourier transform of the euv electric field is @xmath94 therefore , we obtain from eqs .  , , and the linear susceptibility as @xmath95    this equation shows that the linear susceptibility has poles that are simply related to transition energies of the ion core .",
    "the existence of an @xmath1-independent linear susceptibility allows one to use beer s law [ eq .  ] to calculate the spectrum of the euv radiation transmitted through the target medium . from a practical perspective , this means the following : under the conditions assumed , one obtains , by taking the logarithm of @xmath96 , a quantity that is proportional to the euv one - photon cross section @xmath97}{n_{\\mathrm{at}}}.\\ ] ]    now we are ready to give an explicit expression for the euv one - photon cross section of strong - field - generated kr@xmath98 ions .",

    "the fourth term is a sum of absorptive and _ dispersive _ line shapes and depends on the coherence @xmath103 , which is a periodic function of the pump - probe time delay .",
    "the period ( 6  fs @xcite ) is defined by the energy difference between the @xmath74 and @xmath75 channels . note that for the hole dynamics to be observable in the spectrum of the transmitted radiation , it is not necessary for the relevant resonance lines ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) to spectrally overlap .",
    "only the coherent excitation of the two resonances is required , which we achieved by using an attosecond probe pulse , i.e. , a pulse with sufficient coherent bandwidth .",
