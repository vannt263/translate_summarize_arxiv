    "the variable star now known as fu ori was originally believed to be a slow nova because of its leisurely rise from m@xmath5 = 16 to 10 over an interval of about a year in 193739 .",
    "there were some misgivings at the time about that classification : the spectrum was quite unlike that of an ordinary nova , and for a nova the star was most unusually located in the dark cloud barnard 35 , itself in the ob association surrounding @xmath6 ori .",
    "it is now realized that fu ori is no nova , but represents another phenomenon altogether . it is the prototype of a small class of pre - main sequence objects , named ` fuors ' by ambartsumian , that have received an increasing amount of attention over the past three decades .    three additional stars , and possibly 2 more , now collectively define the fuor class on the grounds of a well - documented major rise in brightness , association with a molecular cloud , and a spectrum like that of fu ori .",
    "these ` classical fuors ' are v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg , v1735 cyg , probably v346 nor @xcite , and possibly a star ( cb34v = v1184 tau ) discussed most recently by @xcite .",
    "a number of other pre - main sequence stars have been proposed for membership , usually on the grounds of spectroscopic resemblance plus an infrared excess , but none have been observed to brighten up and remain so for years , as did the classical fuors mentioned above .",
    "the time seems appropriate for a reexamination of the observational situation for two reasons .",
    "first , the other classical fuors remain not far from their maximum brightness , but v1057 cyg has faded about 4 mag .",
    "( in b ) since 1971 .",
    "second , high - resolution spectroscopy has now become feasible for all fuors over a wider wavelength range ( 35009000   ) than was heretofore possible , and in the case of v1057 cyg almost on an annual basis .",
    "the observations to be discussed here have been obtained by petrov and collaborators with the sofin echelle spectrograph @xcite of the nordic optical telescope at la palma between 1996 and 2002 at a resolution of about 13 km s@xmath2 ; and by herbig with the hires echelle at the keck i telescope on mauna kea since 1996 at a resolution of about 7 km s@xmath2 .",
    "several of the sofin runs extended over a number of successive nights , offering the opportunity to search for rapid changes in the spectra .",
    "some of the sofin material has already been discussed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we here expand upon those results .",
    "it is now accepted that fuors represent an interesting phenomenon of early stellar evolution , but it is uncertain how universal it is , and there is disagreement on what is responsible for the outbursts .",
    "hypotheses as to the latter fall into two classes : hartmann , kenyon , and their colleagues have proposed that the flare - up is a phenomenon not of the pre - outburst star itself , but is the result of a major increase in the surface brightness of the circumstellar accretion disk . since the idea was first put forward by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hk ) , it has been elaborated extensively ( and reviewed : * ? ? ?",
    "building upon that proposition , theories of instabilities intrinsic to such an accretion disk have been examined by @xcite , by @xcite and by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which contains references to earlier papers ) .",
    "the opposite hypothesis is that the star itself is responsible for the fuor flare - up .",
    "the absorption lines in the classical fuors are broad ; if they are the result of axial rotation in a spherical limb - darkened star , fits to the optical - region line profiles (   4.2 , below ) yield values of @xmath4 up to about 70 km s@xmath2 in the case of fu ori .",
    "a periodic modulation of the line structure of fu ori ( described in   4.4 ) leads to a radius of the order of 20 sin @xmath7 r@xmath8 .",
    "given those parameters , the condition that fu ori be rotationally stable ( in the sense that the centrifugal acceleration at the equator of a oblate rotator equals the gravitational [ @xcite ] ) is ( m / m@xmath8 ) sin @xmath7 @xmath9 0.79 . clearly , a not - unreasonable value of sin @xmath7 would require a substantial stellar mass to ensure the stability of such a rapid rotator .",
    "an examination by @xcite of the consequences of such very rapid rotation suggested that bar - like deformations would develop that could produce heating of the outer layers of the star , thus accounting for the flare - up and mass loss .",
    "one would think that such instabilities might produce detectable photometric variation with the rotation period .",
    "the only search for such variations is that reported for fu ori by @xcite .",
    "they found only ` random ' fluctuations of amplitude 3 - 4% on time scales of 1 day or less , but it would be worthwhile to repeat such observations with better time coverage . later",
    "(   4.4 ) we describe the results of a search for cyclic variations in radial velocity and line structure in both fu ori and v1057 cyg .",
    "little more has been heard of the rapid - rotator hypothesis , perhaps because of the appeal of the disk - instability idea and the volume of publication that it has engendered .",
    "but on earlier occasions we have pointed out some difficulties and our reservations about the hk proposal @xcite .",
    "the theory was subsequently modified to explain one of those concerns @xcite .",
    "however the new results to be described here call into question the original observational justification for the hk hypothesis , on which that theory is based . in the following sections we examine three issues that have been regarded as crucial support for that hypothesis :    \\(a ) the",
    "` doubling ' of certain absorption lines is evidence of keplerian motion in an inclined disk (   2.4 ) ;    \\(b ) a dependence on @xmath4 on wavelength or excitation potential in the optical region up to 9000   is evidence of the decline in orbital velocity with radius expected under the disk hypothesis (   4.2 ) ; and    \\(c ) the theoretical disk spectrum , as a composite of annuli of temperature and surface brightness that decline with distance from the center , fits the observed spectra of fuors (   4.1 ) .",
    "when v1057 cyg was bright , it was noticed that the spectral type became later with increasing wavelength across the optical region . the effect became striking when observations were extended to the near - ir @xcite and h@xmath10o and co bands",
    "were found in the spectrum of an ostensible f- or g - type star .",
    "no evidence of radial velocity variation with time or with wavelength has been reported , so the spectrum apparently originates in a single object .",
    "the disk hypothesis does have the persuasive advantage of explaining , although not in detail (   4.1 ) , this apparently composite nature of fuor spectra as the falloff of temperature with increasing radius in an accretion disk .",
    "but it is now realized that the simple presence of the 2.3-@xmath11 m co bands in a g supergiant is not that unusual @xcite .",
    "they appear at about g0 ib and are prominent by g8 ib , although in fu ori and v1057 cyg they are as strong as in early m - type .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate if such an effect could be simulated in an extended envelope around a rapidly rotating single star .",
    "we are not necessarily committed to the concept of an unstable rapid rotator as a final solution to the fuor phenomenon .",
    "but for lack of a more persuasive alternative , in what follows we examine the observational information in terms of that hypothesis .",
    "first we describe the spectrum of v1057 cyg during its 19962002 fading , the period for which we have detailed high - resolution coverage (   2 ) , followed by a discussion of its light curve (   3 ) , and then we review the spectroscopic properties of fuors in general (   4 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the b / pg light curve of v1057 cyg .",
    "most of the high - resolution spectra of v1057 cyg discussed in the literature were obtained in the 1980 s , when the star was descending to a plateau of brightness between about b = 13.0 and 13.3 , which extended from 1985 to about 1994 . between 1994 and 1995",
    "it began to fade again , and reached a minimum near 14.9 in 1999 , since which it has recovered slightly .",
    "briefly , following @xcite and @xcite , this is what happened in the spectrum during the post-1994 minimum with respect to the 1980s :    the photospheric lines became much shallower , some with pronounced emission cores ; + the p cyg absorptions in h@xmath3 , infrared and other lines became stronger ; + the shortward - shifted shell components in the low excitation lines increased in strength + ( 1996 - 97 ) , then essentially disappeared ( 1999 ) , but reappeared in 2001 ; + tio bands in the expanding shell appeared for the first time , and + a number of emission lines of low excitation appeared in the spectrum .",
    "+      simple inspection of the absorption spectrum of v1057 cyg shows that it resembles that of a rotationally broadened early - g supergiant . to make this quantitative , the excitation temperature and gravity were determined as follows .",
    "equivalent widths ( hereafter abbreviated ew ) were measured for 30 of the least blended photospheric lines of in the region 4950 - 8000    ( shell components , which could distort the measurements , were almost absent in this spectral region in 19981999 ) .",
    "the curve of growth gives t@xmath12 = 5300 @xmath13 300 k. the single measurable line of , @xmath6 5991 , lies on this curve at a position corresponding to log n@xmath14 = 12 .",
    "these are indeed values expected for a g1 supergiant .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of v1057 cyg with templates of 41 cyg ( f5 ii ) , @xmath15 aqr ( g0 ib ) , 9 peg ( g5 ib ) and 40 peg ( g8 ii ) show that the line ratios correspond to f7-g3 i - ii .",
    "the photospheric absorption lines in august 1997 appeared to be shallower than in the spectra found in the literature .",
    "many of the lower- excitation lines appear double , as the result of what is clearly an emission component at the bottom of the absorption .",
    "with respect to spectra of the 1980 s , this line ` doubling , ' measured as a velocity separation between the two absorption minima , had increased by october 1996 , and even more by august 1997 , as the result of what is clearly an emission component appearing at the bottom of the absorption line ( see   2.4 ) . however , the line width of the absorptions near the continuum level remains the same as in the spectra taken , e.g. , in 198384 by @xcite and in 1992 by @xcite .",
    "that is , the overall line width has not changed , but in those where the central reversal has become more prominent the line depth has been reduced . in this way",
    "many photospheric lines appear significantly shallower than in the accretion disk model of @xcite , which was designed to fit the spectrum of v1057 cyg in 1985 ( fig .",
    "however , there is another effect as well : in the red , higher - excitation lines where no central emission is expected are also shallower than in the spun - up standards , as if a veiling continuum is superposed upon the absorption spectrum .",
    "veiling factors of 0.3 to 0.5 are indicated .",
    "table 1 gives the parameters of the p cyg structure at h@xmath3 as measured on all spectra either published or our own .",
    "one sees that the mass - loss in the wind of v1057 cyg , as evidenced by the strength of the p cyg absorption component at h@xmath3 , began to increase about 1984 - 85 @xcite , near the beginning of the photometric plateau .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the two may be connected .",
    "earlier , the p cyg absorption of h@xmath3 was not saturated and its structure varied considerably at all velocities ( * ? ? ? * and table 1 ) . during the post - plateau minimum ( i.e. , after 199495 ) the line remained strong , but the high velocity wing ( @xmath16 to @xmath17 km s@xmath2 ) varied in depth from year to year while the low velocity section ( @xmath18 to @xmath19 km s@xmath2 ) always remained deep ( figs .",
    "7 , 24 ) .",
    "the only known observations of h@xmath3 during the plateau decade are those obtained in 1988 by @xcite and by budge ( unpublished ) .",
    "those entries in table 1 have been measured from their profiles .",
    "the ew of the p cyg absorption component in that year was the largest that has been reported .",
    "no other observations of h@xmath3 are known to have been made during 1986 - 95 , but @xcite measured the structure of h@xmath15 and h@xmath20 between 1978 and 1990 ( photographically and at a resolution of about 1000 ) .",
    "his data indicate that the ew of h@xmath15 declined from 1978 to 1985 but had increased again by 1987 ( no observation in 1986 ) , continued to increase thereafter and by 1990 was the largest he had observed .    the lack of adequate spectroscopic coverage of v1057 cyg during the 1986 - 95 decade is regrettable .",
    "figure 2 shows the p cyg profiles of the h@xmath3 , h@xmath15 , and @xmath68542 lines on the 1997 august sofin spectrogram .",
    "( throughout we denote the measured ( heliocentric ) velocity of a features as @xmath21 and the stellar velocity as @xmath22 , so velocity in the star s rest frame is @xmath23 = @xmath21  @xmath22 . )",
    "the h@xmath3 profile is similar to that of fu ori , where the mass - loss rate was estimated to be an order of magnitude larger than in v1057 cyg in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the low excitation ( @xmath241 ev ) photospheric absorption lines of v1057 cyg have almost always been flanked shortward by narrow , often complex ` shell ' features .",
    "they are prominent in the strong low - excitation lines of the neutral metals at shorter wavelengths .",
    "they are probably due to condensations in the expanding wind passing in front of the star . in 1996 , by which time the star had faded by about 1 mag .",
    "( in b ) from plateau brightness , both the p cyg absorption at the balmer lines and the shell lines had become stronger , to such a degree that the shell also became detectable at many lines in the red .    figure 3",
    "shows some shell line profiles at the 13 km s@xmath2 sofin resolution .",
    "the underlying photospheric spectrum has been subtracted , as described later (   2.5 ) .",
    "the strong lines of higher excitation potential ( hereafter ep ) , as @xmath65183 and @xmath65316 , also contain shortward shell components but at more negative velocities , about @xmath19 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these absorptions are much broader than those at the low excitation lines , and so represent an intermediate case between shell and wind .",
    "another indicator of a cool expanding shell are the numerous tio bands ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "all the tio bands were blue - shifted to rv = @xmath25 to @xmath26 km s@xmath2 ; i.e. to about the same velocity as the shell components of low excitation lines .",
    "these shell lines and the tio bands in the red were strongest in 1996 , weaker in 1997 , and absent in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 . by 2001 the shell lines and tio bands had reappeared , but with somewhat broader profiles and larger expansion velocities ( see fig .  3 , bottom ) .",
    "the complexity of the shell structure is more apparent at hires resolution , where at least five separate components are seen .",
    "the shell was so prominent in 199697 at low - level lines of neutral metals ( , , , , ) , as well as in , , and as to confuse the shortward wings of the underlying stellar features .",
    "the 49905020   region , containing a number of prominent lines , is shown in figure 5 . at the top of the figure",
    "is the same section in the g5 ib star hd 190113 , as broadened by @xmath4 = 55 km s@xmath2 , to represent the underlying photospheric spectrum .    at that time ( 1997 aug . 12",
    "- 13 ) , the shell lines were at velocities of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 km s@xmath2 ; the velocity of the star itself is near @xmath32 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a number of these complex shell lines have been decomposed in the following way .",
    "each component was represented as a pure absorption line of depth e@xmath33 , where @xmath34 was gaussian ( of the form exp@xmath35 ) ) whose velocity , depth , and fwhm could be adjusted ; the observed profile followed by adding the individual @xmath34 s at every pixel across the line .",
    "figure 6 shows fits to @xmath64999 , where dashed lines outline the individual components , the solid line the observed profile , and a series of crosses show the representation .",
    "table 2 gives the parameters found to fit 2 representative lines as well as @xmath66496 , @xmath66707 , and @xmath36 7800 , 7947 .",
    "a source of uncertainty in these fits was the choice of continuum level under the shell line .",
    "ideally that would be the underlying photospheric line spectrum as represented by an artificially broadened f - g supergiant ( as in fig .",
    "5 ) , but it was clear that an adequate match could be achieved only by adding in a veiling continuum as well . until this effect could be understood , and applied in a consistent wavelength - dependent fashion , it was decided simply to interpolate the continuum level linearly between two points just outside either edge of the shell line .",
    "the equivalent widths of components 1 and 2 are particularly susceptible to errors in the continuum level so defined .",
    "nine unblended lines having lower levels between 0.0 and 1.4 ev were synthesized in this way .",
    "for each of the 5 shell components , the ews were fitted to a theoretical pure - absorption curve of growth , and the values of the parameter @xmath37 ( the doppler width in velocity units ) , the excitation temperature @xmath38 and the total column density n ( ) extracted .",
    "they are listed in table 3 .",
    "these temperatures are estimated to be uncertain by several hundred degrees . for most components @xmath37 ranges between about 2 and 5 km s@xmath2 , intermediate between the thermal velocities for ti ( 1.1 km s@xmath2 ) and h ( 8 km s@xmath2 ) at the t@xmath12 s of table 3 .",
    "however the measured fwhms of the individual shell lines scatter between about 8 and 19 km s@xmath2 ( following allowance for the instrumental fwhm of 6 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "this shows that there is another source of line broadening in these expanding shells , possibly weak unresolved structure .",
    "eight unblended shell lines were analyzed in the same way .",
    "the scatter in the fit of the gaussian ews to the curve of growth was much larger than for , possibly because of greater uncertainties in defining the continuum level .",
    "only the results for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 km s@xmath2 components are considered reliable .",
    "the t@xmath12 for was very clearly lower than for , between about 1350 and 1500 k. the total column density if t@xmath12 = 1500 k is near log n ( ) = 17.4 .",
    "this difference between the t@xmath12 s of and is puzzling , because their identical velocity structures indicate that they originate in the same parcels of rising gas .",
    "possibly non - lte conditions in the shell are responsible .    the evolution of the shell and wind absorptions during the brightness minimum of 19962001 is shown in figure 7 , from sofin spectra .",
    "one might expect that the shell features would be stronger at minimum brightness , but in fact at minimum in 19981999 it was the _ wind _",
    "features that were enhanced , while the shell components were strongest in 199697 and 2001 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 8 , which compares the 46604690 region on the hires spectrogram of 1997 aug .",
    "12 ( below ) with that of 1998 oct .",
    "30 ( above ) .",
    "the shell lines ( 4667.58 and 4681.91  ) were strong on the first date but had essentially disappeared 15 months later . at that second date ,",
    "weak , narrow emission lines ( arrowed ) at approximately the stellar velocity were detectable .",
    "an unusual feature of the shell spectrum is the prominence of the lines of at 7800 and 7947  .",
    "their ews in the @xmath30 km s@xmath2 component were 194 and 127 m  in 1997 august .",
    "the first ionization potential ( ip ) of rb is 4.8 ev , so one would expect it to be ionized because barium , with first ip = 5.2 ev and a comparable meteoritic abundance to rubidium , is detectable only as ( @xmath66496 , ew = 267 m ) .",
    "the non - detection of @xmath68521 is understandable because of the still lower first ip of cesium ( 3.9 ev ) and a lower meteoritic abundance ( rb / cs = 19 ) , but the strength of remains unexplained .      before 1997 , the only obvious optical emission lines in v1057 cyg were the components of the p cyg structure of h@xmath3 and . in that year , when the star had begun its decline following the 19851994 plateau , a number of emission lines of low excitation appeared in the centers of the corresponding stellar absorptions @xcite .",
    "the most conspicuous were [ rmt 12 ] 8047 and 8074  , followed by [ 60 ] 8514 , [ 40 ] 6516 , [ 1 ] 6572 , and [ 12 ] 7912  : figure 9 .",
    "these emission peaks are at about the stellar velocity , and are narrower than the photospheric absorption lines .",
    "a higher - resolution hires spectrogram of 1997 august 13 confirms the asymmetry of the @xmath36 8047 , 8074 lines that is apparent in figure 9 : their shortward edges are clearly steeper than the longward .",
    "most of these same low - excitation emission lines were observed long ago in the g supergiant @xmath39 cas by @xcite .",
    "this appearance of emission in the centers of many low - excitation absorption lines is illustrated in figure 10 which compares the 6400   region on a lick coud spectrogram of 1985 may 27 ( resolution about 18 km s@xmath2 ) with the hires spectrogram of 1997 aug .",
    "13 , slightly smoothed . in those intervening 12 years , the centers of the absorption lines @xmath36 6393 , 6400 increased in brightness with respect to the continuum , rising at peak to almost the continuum level .",
    "( a second lick spectrogram obtained on 1985 sept . 25 showed no change had taken place during those 4 months . )",
    "we believe that this emission spectrum is produced in a warm layer we call a ` chromosphere ' that is almost overwhelmed by the photospheric continuum when the star is bright , except through its marginal appearance as emission cores in lower - excitation stellar absorption lines .",
    "however , that chromosphere must have become brighter by a factor of about 2 between 1985 and 1997 .",
    "the reason : between those dates v1057 cyg faded by only about 0.9 mag .  in v , so if the 1997 emission cores in @xmath36 6393 , 6400 had been present at that same absolute brightness in 1985 , they would have filled those absorption lines up to about half the depth actually observed .    to determine whether there was any further change in the brightness level of the chromosphere , the ews of several emission cores were measured in the sofin differential spectra (   2.5 ) of v1057 cyg ( minus @xmath15 aqr spun up to @xmath4 = 55 km s@xmath2 and not veiled ) between 1996 and 2001 .",
    "the results are given in table 4 .",
    "over these years , the emission line ews remained constant within the errors of measurement ; i.e. as the star faded , the lines became weaker in the same proportion .",
    "we conclude that there was no further change in the absolute intensity of the chromosphere after the increase by a factor of approximately 2 sometime between 1985 and 1997 .",
    "this brightening of the chromosphere may have been related to the increase in the wind activity that began in 1984 - 85 (   2.2 ) .",
    "as v1057 cyg has declined in brightness , the fading of the continuum has helped to reveal this chromospheric emission spectrum .",
    "we believe that it is this spectrum that is responsible for the apparent ` doubling ' of some absorption lines that has been suggested as evidence of orbital motion in a keplerian disk . in an earlier paper on the spectrum of fu ori",
    "@xcite we argued for such an explanation of the ` doubling ' , a possibility in fact first mentioned by @xcite .",
    "the fading of v1057 cyg has now provided strong support for that interpretation .",
    "these central reversals which have emerged as distinct emission lines since 1995 are not very strong , e.g. , @xmath68047 has a peak intensity of only 58% above the continuum level . if the continuum were one magnitude brighter ( or the chromosphere fainter ) , the line would appear only as an emission core at the bottom of a broader photospheric absorption , as in 6707 (fig .",
    "9 ) . for a quantitative analysis of this emission spectrum",
    ", the underlying photospheric contribution must first be subtracted .",
    "this is described below (   2.5 ) , as is a comparison with the low - temperature ( t@xmath40 about 2700 k ) emission spectrum of vy tau at the time of a flare - up , to which it bears a strong resemblance .",
    "the central intensities of such chromospheric emissions would , in the optically thick limit , rise to the planck flux at that temperature . therefore  depending in individual cases upon _ gf _ value and lower ep  the strengths of those lines with respect to the hotter photospheric continuum would tend to increase toward longer wavelengths .",
    "this would explain the greater prominence of line ` doubling ' in the red than at shorter wavelengths that has been noted , for example , by hk .",
    "the strong h & k emission lines at 3933 , 3968   ( discussed in ",
    "4.5 ) and at the infrared triplet are probably produced in this chromosphere , presumably the same that @xcite found necessary to reproduce the h@xmath3 profile of fu ori .",
    "the balmer emission lines that ought to be produced in the same region are concealed by the p cyg structure of the wind , except for the longward emission fringe at h@xmath3 .",
    "the shortward edges of the emission lines are truncated by their own p cyg absorptions .",
    "clearly , the outflowing wind is located _ above _ this chromosphere , demonstrated also by the presence of fluorescent 4063 and 4132   lines in v1057 cyg : those atoms ",
    "see \" the exciting @xmath63968 emission line , although it is hidden from us by the wind component of h@xmath41 .",
    "a very broad emission , at peak only about 0.12 above continuum level , is present at 6297   on the hires spectrum of 1997 august 13 ( that region falls between orders on other exposures )",
    ". it must be [ ] @xmath6 6300.30 because the weaker [ ] line at 6363   is present on other hires and sofin spectra of 19961998 . the central velocity of @xmath66300 is about @xmath42 km s@xmath2 , its total width at continuum level about 180 km s@xmath2 . a similar broad , shortward - displaced emission line is also present at the position of [ ] @xmath67155 .",
    "they have nearly the same velocity as the  intermediate case between shell and wind \" components mentioned in   2.3 .",
    "no such features are found in fu ori .",
    "the reader should be aware that fuors are not unique in possessing broad absorption lines with emission cores and co absorption in the 2 @xmath11 m region : a number of normal ( i.e. not pre - main sequence ) f- and g - type high luminosity stars are known to have such spectra .",
    "several examples were mentioned by @xcite and more recently , the classical case of @xmath39 cas has been rediscussed by @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in addition to the photospheric spectrum , these sets of spectral features were present in v1057 cyg during this period at different radial velocities :    wind at @xmath43 to @xmath44 km s@xmath2 ( h@xmath3 , d@xmath45 , , , i ) ; + shell at @xmath25 to @xmath46 km s@xmath2 ( tio and low excitation atomic lines in absorption ) ; + co molecules at about the stellar velocity (   3.5 ) ; and + low - excitation chromospheric emission at the stellar velocity .",
    "+      as already pointed out , a number of low excitation lines clearly went into emission above the continuum during the brightness minimum of 19962001 .",
    "it is natural that the same feature should be present in higher excitation lines if only as an emission core at the bottom of the absorption line , but enough to cause those lines to appear double and shallow , as is observed @xcite .",
    "such line emission can be revealed by subtracting the underlying photospheric spectrum . as a template for the photospheric spectrum of v1057 cyg we use",
    "@xmath15 aqr spun up to @xmath4 = 55 km s@xmath2 and veiled by a factor 0.3 .",
    "two fragments of this differential spectrum are shown in figure 11 for the average spectrum of 19982000 .",
    "note that the relative strength of the emission lines is not the same as in the absorption spectrum .",
    "both the  true \" emissions ( that rise above the continuum ) and those revealed in such a differential spectrum fall along a common curve of growth for t@xmath40 = 3600 @xmath13 300k , log n@xmath14 = 7.5 @xmath13 0.5 .",
    "this temperature is significantly lower than photospheric . in the m - type dwarf",
    "vy tau , the same emission lines appeared very strong by contrast with that low temperature continuum @xcite .",
    "there is a good correlation between the equivalent widths of the low - temperature line emissions in vy tau and those in the differential spectrum of v1057 cyg : figure 12 .",
    "the same method was used by @xcite to reveal the emission lines in the differential spectra of fuors , but the template they used for subtraction was the accretion disk model spectrum .",
    "the line depths in v1057 cyg are now very different from both @xmath15 aqr and that disk model ( fig .  13 ) .",
    "although the observed line intensities can be explained as a sum of the photospheric and emission line spectra , the observed _ line profile _ is not just a sum of two gaussians .",
    "weaker lines have a rather  boxy \" shape , with sharp edges , while stronger lines ( without shell components ) have nearly normal rotational profiles except for the emission cores .",
    "this difference suggests some abnormality in the structure of the lower atmosphere , deserving of attention at high resolution @xmath4760,000 and s / n @xmath47 300 .",
    "conventional assumption is that a fuor outburst represents only a temporary event and that the star will eventually return to its former brightness .",
    "the slow fading of fu ori over the past 60 years , and the relatively rapid decline of v1057 cyg since about 1971 might be explained in this way .",
    "but the spectrum of v1057 cyg does not support this expectation . before the 1970 outburst , the star possessed h@xmath3 emission that , in order to have been detected at all in the first low - resolution surveys , by @xcite in the early 1950s and by @xcite in 195256 , must have had an equivalent width of approximately 2540  .",
    "no such emission has appeared at h@xmath3 during the decline to the 19992000 minimum : the emission fringe has remained near ew(h@xmath3 ) = 12   ( table 1 ) .",
    "another departure from expectation is the following . before the outburst",
    "a number of and emission lines were reported @xcite , so they must have been fairly strong to have been detectable on that 1957 low - dispersion photographic spectrogram . yet at the present time no emission lines are detectable in the blue - violet on modern , far superior digital spectrograms , although the fluorescent 4063 , 4132   lines are weakly present .",
    "furthermore , as the star has declined one would have expected the absorption spectrum to approach that of a tts - like k- or m - type dwarf . in 19981999",
    "v1057 cyg was only about 1.5 mag .",
    "( in b ) above its pre - outburst level ( b = 14.9 ) so if the star was returning to its original t tau state , a late type photosphere and emission line spectrum ought to have emerged .",
    "but in spite of the drop in brightness , the spectral type of v1057 cyg remained the same as in the 1980 s : in ",
    "2.1 it was shown that the star continues to resemble a rapidly rotating g supergiant , unlike any other pre - main sequence star of which we are aware .",
    "but the spectroscopic similarity is deceptive : the m@xmath48 s are quite different .",
    "if the surface brightness and ( v - r)@xmath49 color of v1057 cyg at the time of the 19851994 plateau were the same as those of the standard g0 ib @xmath15 aqr , then correction for a@xmath48 = 2.35 mag",
    ".  leads to m@xmath50 for a distance of 600 pc .",
    "this compares to m@xmath51 for @xmath15 aqr .",
    "that m@xmath48 for v1057 cyg would be produced by a single star of uniform surface brightness having a radius of about 9 r@xmath8 .",
    "given these considerations , and the fact that v1057 cyg both pre- and post - outburst was unusual in its possession of a very massive high - velocity wind (   4.5 ) , we later speculate that pre - outburst fuors are not normal tts , but represent a special sub - species of that class .",
    "we suggest that the behavior of v1057 cyg as it has faded , as well as for the general spectroscopic properties of the classical fuors , may be understood in terms of a stratified atmosphere atop a rapid rotator with a strong quasi - permanent outflowing wind , a low effective @xmath52 being responsible for the line - spectrum resemblance .",
    "the emission spectrum which has appeared as the continuum of v1057 cyg has faded is , as we have stressed , that of a low - excitation chromosphere atop the stellar atmosphere (   2.4 ) .",
    "the decline of v1057 cyg from its 1971 peak brightness to the plateau level in 198594 can be represented by a continuous change in radius and surface brightness of a rapid rotator , those quantities being derivable from the procedure of @xcite and the above values of extinction and distance . observed @xmath53 and @xmath54 for 19712001",

    "the resulting values of r / r@xmath8 are plotted in figure 14 .",
    "the symbols identifying the sources of the photometry are explained in the caption . , but from its dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "our radii come instead from the dependence on ( v - r)@xmath49 , following the recommendation of barnes et al . , and the fact that an excess shortward of 4800   was present between 1971 and 197576 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  8) , which would make @xmath55 suspect .",
    "it is of course unclear which color is more likely to be applicable to an unusual object like v1057 cyg . ]",
    "radii and surface brightnesses depend upon whose colors are used .",
    "if the ibrahimov data , figure 14 shows how r / r@xmath8 fell from about 14 near maximum light to about 9 at the time of the plateau .",
    "the surface brightnesses declined from values appropriate a late a - type main sequence star in 1971 , to a mid - k type in 1995 .    we emphasize that such calculations _ do not prove _ that the source is a spherical star , only that the brightness and color can be represented by a circular surface of those dimensions and surface brightness .    in 198485",
    "the wind flux began to increase (   2.2 ) , and at about the same time the decline in brightness halted .",
    "sometime between 1985 and 1997we speculate that it may have been early in that interval  the chromosphere is known to have brightened with respect to the continuum .",
    "thus all three phenomena may have been consequences of an upsurge of activity in the underlying rapidly rotating star .",
    "the plateau episode ended when , between 1994 and 1995 , the star abruptly became fainter by 0.78 mag .  in b , and redder by 0.18 mag .  in @xmath55 ( seasonal averages ) ; see the small plot of b - v vs time at the bottom of figure 1 .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 is not far from the standard interstellar reddening value ( 4.1 ) .",
    "thereafter (   2.4 ) the continuum and chromosphere fluctuated in brightness together , so we ascribe the 199495 fading to screening by a dust layer somewhere higher in the atmosphere .",
    "this is not a new idea : the possibility of dust condensation in the outflowing wind of v1057 cyg has already been raised by @xcite , and it will be recalled that @xcite interpreted a relatively brief dimming of the fuor v1515 cyg in 1980 as such an event .",
    "the formation of such a dust layer was also envisioned by @xcite in the case of r crb , also a high - luminosity g star",
    ".    however v1057 cyg continued to fade , @xmath57 mag .  by 1999 , apparently without any further change in color .",
    "either more dust dominated by large particles , or a continuation of the slow post-1971 decline , could be responsible .",
    "the foregoing is an attempt to pull together the photometric and spectroscopic phenomena exhibited by v1057 cyg since the 197071 outburst .",
    "however , it is likely that the atmospheric structure is not radially homogeneous , as this picture may seem to imply .",
    "the day - to - day and secular fluctuations observed in the h@xmath3 structure at both v1057 cyg and fu ori show that wind ejection is spasmodic , possibly coming from localized areas on the rotating star , rather as the fast solar wind emerges from ` coronal holes ' on the sun .",
    "it would then not be surprising if the wind fields above these stars contained much structure .",
    "the hst images of v1057 cyg (   3.1 ) show that the distribution of dust near that star , whether formed in and ejected by the star or local dust shaped by the stellar wind , is highly structured",
    ".    the disappearance and reappearance of the shell spectrum of v1057 cyg on a time scale of a few years can not be due to pure radial expansion and the consequent decline in column density proportional to r@xmath58 .",
    "it may be caused by the movement of inhomogeneities in the wind structure across the line of sight .",
    "the broad shortward - shifted [ ] and [ ] lines described in   2.4 could then arise in this expanding , inhomogeneous envelope , their longward wings being occulted by the star .",
    "unexplained is the veiling mentioned earlier that was used to account for the general shallowing of the absorption spectrum .",
    "it is conceivable that the line shallowness is intrinsic , i.e. , the result of integration over a very non - uniform stellar hemisphere , or of line formation in a highly non - spherical extended atmosphere , or of the contribution of a continuum originating in the chromosphere . if extrinsic , thermal emission by dust is an unlikely explanation , because although the energy absorbed in the hypothetical dust layer must reappear somewhere , dust would not survive at temperatures greater than about 1500 k so that that re - emission would be significant only at long wavelengths , not in the optical .",
    "if dust did form in the lower atmosphere of v1057 cyg in 1994 and was subsequently expelled with the wind , then in time it might become detectable in scattered light .",
    "given an ejection velocity of 200 km s@xmath2 and no subsequent deceleration , then the separation of dust and star in the plane of the sky would increase at the rate of 007 yr@xmath2 , so that in the 5 years following 1994 that dust would in projection appear about 035 from the star .",
    "five wfpc2 images of v1057 cyg are available in the hst archive .",
    "they were obtained with hst on 1999 oct .",
    "18 as part of a ` snapshot ' program ; the filters were f606w ( central wavelength 5957  ) and f814w ( 7940  ) .",
    "we are grateful to karl stapelfeldt , the principal investigator , for the opportunity to study this material .",
    "we did no more than obtain the pipeline processed images from the archive and trim and clean up cosmic ray hits and other defects .",
    "those f606w images are shown in figure 15 .",
    "there is much scattered light and spurious structure surrounding the overexposed star image , so that nothing can be said whether structure exists as near as 03 from the star . however , at least three features at somewhat larger separations are present and appear to be real , judging from inspection of similar images of ordinary stars on other wfpc2 frames taken in the same series .",
    "they are identified by letters .",
    "c is the brightest ; it appears as a structureless blob protruding from the star image to a distance of about 1@xmath59 , while a and b are fainter , curved arcs reminiscent of the larger loops at v1057 cyg and other fuors described by @xcite .",
    "the arc d is more distant , and is located at the base of a similar structure present on ground - based images of v1057 cyg obtained in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "the reality of a , b and c is confirmed when the image of a single star ( from another frame ) is subtracted from the shortest f606w exposure : see the lower right panel of figure 15 .",
    "the feature c is apparently only a section of an extended nebulous bar .",
    "there is no persuasive correspondence of this structure very near the star with the molecular - line or 1.3 mm continuum maps of @xcite .",
    "if c is a slab of warm dust very near the star , consider the possibility that its thermal emission may contribute significantly to the integrated ir emission of v1057 cyg .",
    "an estimate of its relative contribution can be made as follows .",
    "assume that the true separation of star and slab is as projected , 08 ( 480 au ) , and that the star radiates as a black body of @xmath60 k and radius 9 r@xmath8 .",
    "then the equilibrium temperature of a small silicate particle exposed to that radiation field is obtained by balancing the energy absorbed by the amount re - radiated . given the absorption cross - sections for ` astronomical silicate ' @xcite , the temperature of a 0.1 @xmath11 m silicate particle at that position is found to be about 75 k , with a weak dependence on particle radius .",
    "if the slab , an assemblage of such particles , radiates as a black surface of dimensions 033 @xmath61 064 at 75 k , then its flux would be dominant over that of the star at wavelengths greater than about 14 @xmath11 m .",
    "on the other hand , if the slab preserved the optical properties of its constituents , then the crossover wavelength would depend on particle radius , being at about 19 @xmath11 m for 0.1 @xmath11 m particles , at 16.5 @xmath11 m for 0.4 @xmath11 m , and at 15.5 @xmath11 m for 1.0 @xmath11 m . obviously , thermal emission from such nearby dust must contribute to the sed s of stars like v1057 cyg , although to lesser degree than these estimates if the cloud were optically thin .",
    "dust formed in the atmosphere of v1057 cyg and then ejected could have reached the slab s present position in as short as 12 years .",
    "nothing is known of the earlier history of v1057 cyg but if there have been previous outbursts , each with its own dust - formation episode , such distant dust concentrations might be explained .",
    "future high - resolution imaging will show whether these structures are moving with respect to v1057 cyg .",
    "unfortunately no comparable hst imagery is available at this time for fu ori .",
    "conventional ground - based ccd images obtained with the 2.3-m telescope on mauna kea show extensive reflection nebulosity around that star , with brightness increasing toward the star before merging at about 3@xmath59 with the overexposed star image .",
    "coronagraphic images reproduced by @xcite extend this in to about 25 .",
    "as at v1057 cyg , this material and that detected at 2.3 @xmath11 m very near fu ori by @xcite may contribute significantly to those sed s .",
    "accretion disk models were devised by @xcite to explain the spectral energy distribution and the peculiar double - peak profiles of the photospheric lines in v1057 cyg and fu ori . in those models ,",
    "the high - resolution spectra were synthesized by assuming that at any given radius the disk radiates as a stellar atmosphere of the appropriate spectral type .",
    "the variation of effective temperature with radius is given by the steady disk theory , and the variation of the rotational velocity with radius is assumed to be keplerian .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the disk can then be represented as a composite of annuli of different temperature , surface brightness , and rotational velocity .",
    "the models reproduce reasonably well the atomic lines in the optical region and the molecular bands in the infrared .",
    "in addition to fu ori and v1057 cyg , the spectrum of z cma was compared to the disk model by @xcite , revealing numerous emission lines in the differential spectrum ( i.e. , observed minus synthetic ) of z cma , rather as is seen in v1057 cyg near minimum brightness .",
    "however not all spectral lines can be reproduced by the disk model . some lines in regions of the spectrum",
    "not examined by @xcite are in striking contradiction to the model prediction . because the spectrum of v1057 cyg has changed due to the increasing prominence of line emission",
    "as the star has faded toward minimum brightness , in what follows we first demonstrate these discrepancies in the spectrum of fu ori because it has not changed significantly over the last two decades .",
    "new synthetic disk spectra were calculated for fu ori and v1057 cyg using the parameters of the disk models given by @xcite and a set of our own template spectra ( see table 5 ) obtained at the nordic optical telescope with sofin .",
    "as an example , the synthetic and the observed spectra of fu ori are shown in figure 16 for the spectral range 5260 - 5320  .",
    "this synthetic spectrum looks identical to that shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of fu ori in 1998 was also very similar to that displayed by @xcite .    in the accretion disk model for fu ori",
    ", the relative contribution from different parts of the disk ( i.e. , from different spectral types ) to the total flux radiated by the disk depends on wavelength as is shown in table 6 [ contribution ] . at 5500 ",
    "the spectrum of the disk is mostly of f - g type , while at 9000   all spectral types contribute about equally .",
    "this means that at 9000   one can find f - type spectral features along with m - type , e.g. , both high - excitation lines and tio bands .",
    "if we consider relative line strengths , the composite spectrum of the accretion disk looks much the same as the spectrum of a normal g supergiant because the same atomic lines are changing smoothly from late f through g to early k types",
    ". the difference can be found only in early type f , where the lines of high - excitation species appear strongly , and in type m where molecular bands , mostly of tio , appear very strong .",
    "since both f and m spectral types contribute to the accretion disk model of fu ori , we examine the observed spectrum in order to determine how these critical features behave .",
    "the most suitable spectral region for such an analysis is around 8900  .",
    "it contains two lines having lower ep of 7.05 ev ( 8912.06 and 8927.35  ) which are very strong only in type f , a line of v i at 8919.80   having ep = 1.2 ev which increases in strength from type g to m , and a strong tio bandhead at 8860  , characteristic of type m.    the telluric spectrum was extracted from a spectrum of the o7e fast rotator @xmath62 per , and with it weak terrestrial lines were removed from the fuor spectra . in order to reduce the noise , all the spectra of fu ori taken in 19972000 were averaged .",
    "for v1057 cyg , to avoid a possible contribution from the shell , only the 19982000 spectra were averaged because in those years the shortward - shifted tio features were absent .",
    "comparison of the synthetic spectrum of the accretion disk and the observed spectrum of fu ori is shown in figure 17 .",
    "some of the template spectra are also displayed in the figure to show the origin of the main features in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "as expected , the synthetic spectrum of the accretion disk shows all the f- and m - type features . in the observed spectrum of fu ori the blend at 8860",
    "  resembles that in the synthetic spectrum , except that the tio head is not obviously present probably on account of the overlap by paschen line at 8862  .",
    "the absence of tio is better shown in v1057 cyg ( fig .",
    "21 , below ) .",
    "more obvious is the difference between the observed and synthetic spectra in the width of the and lines .",
    "that region is expanded in figure 18 . in the synthetic spectrum",
    "these lines have very different widths because they originate from the innermost and from the outermost regions of the disk , respectively rotating at very different keplerian velocities , but in the observed spectrum the lines have about the same widths .",
    "another example is shown in figure 19 : the high - excitation line of @xmath67442.30 , ep = 10.3 ev , is strong in the f - type spectra , is present and highly doubled in the synthetic spectrum of fu ori but is absent in the observed one .",
    "figure 20 shows that the sco / tio feature at 6036   is absent in the observed spectrum of fu ori , while it is quite obvious in the synthetic .",
    "the 8900   spectral region in v1057 cyg also reveals a difference between observed and model spectra ( fig .",
    "since the rotational velocity is lower than in fu ori , the tio head is well resolved in the model spectrum .",
    "the tio feature is clearly absent in the average spectrum of v1057 cyg , or in the noisier 19982000 individual spectra .",
    "here we have considered only those spectral features detectable at the resolution of the sofin material .",
    "much more could be done with spectra of higher resolution .",
    "but at the moment we conclude that comparison of the observed and synthetic spectra of fu ori in the near infrared shows that some critical spectral features do not have the structure predicted by the multi - temperature disk model , although some elaboration of that model might be able to account for the mismatches",
    ". a rapidly rotating single star will have a latitude - dependent spectrum , whose appearance in integrated light will be a function of aspect angle .",
    "it remains to be seen if such an object might produce a fuor - like spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath4 and the nature of the photospheric line broadening in fuors have been a subject of much discussion .",
    "@xcite measured absorption line widths on v1057 cyg spectrograms obtained in 1986 and 1988 when the star was brighter , and found them to depend on wavelength , being larger in the blue and smaller in the red .",
    "this they interpreted as demonstration of differential rotation in a keplerian accretion disk , as predicted by the hk disk model .",
    "the shortward - displaced shell spectrum had been present at some level on all our spectra of v1057 cyg , but is most prominent at the shorter wavelengths where most of the low - level lines of the neutral metals are located .",
    "it was very strong in 199697 , so @xmath4 was measured only on the 19982000 sofin spectra and as an additional precaution , to avoid any marginal shell contribution , only the longward wings of the photospheric lines were fitted .",
    "thirty selected lines were compared to the template spectrum ( @xmath15 aqr , g0 ib ) spun up to a set of discrete values of @xmath4 . since the line depth in v1057 cyg at that time was smaller than in the template , a veiling contribution ( which does not affect the line width )",
    "was applied to rescale the line depth .",
    "the result was that in v1057 cyg the average @xmath63 km s@xmath2 , with a scatter of individual lines mostly between 50 and 60 km s@xmath2 .",
    "no systematic trend with wavelength was present in the range 5000 - 9000  , nor was there any trend with ep in the range 18 ev .",
    "the minimal level of veiling is about 0.3 .",
    "it is larger for individual lines filled in with emission , especially those of lower ep ( see below ) .",
    "this value of @xmath4 ( 55 km s@xmath2 ) is larger than those published by @xcite ( 3545 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , they measured line half - widths at half depth , which in a rotationally broadened profile is about 0.8 @xmath4 ( the precise value of the factor depending slightly upon the limb darkening assumed ) .",
    "we have also measured the half - widths of the red wings at half depth : the average value is 44 @xmath13 4 km s@xmath2 , in agreement with welty et al . , but again we found no dependence on wavelength or ep .",
    "it is possible , of course , that the spectrum of v1057 cyg changed in this respect during the intervening decade .    the same procedure described above ( fit of longward wings to the spun - up template )",
    "was carried out for fu ori . the best fit was with @xmath4 = 70 km s@xmath2 , and again no relationship between @xmath4 and ep or wavelength was found .",
    "it would not seem likely that the spectrum of fu ori has changed significantly since the welty et al .  observations .",
    "on 1999 oct .",
    "24 both v1057 cyg and fu ori were observed in the 2.3 @xmath11 m region by k. hinkle with the phoenix infrared spectrometer @xcite at the kpno 2.1 m telescope .",
    "the region covered was 4320 to 4340 cm@xmath2 ( 2.315 to 2.304 @xmath11 m ) in the 2 - 0 co band .",
    "these spectrograms had been obtained at the request of lee hartmann , and we are grateful to him for access to the data and to ken hinkle for supplying us with the reduced spectra , as well as those of several early - type stars observed on the same occasion .",
    "this region contains many terrestrial lines , mainly of ch@xmath65 .",
    "these are not removed completely by standard star division because of airmass mismatches . instead",
    ", the value of optical thickness ( required to reproduce the line depth as exp(-@xmath34 ) ) was calculated at every pixel across these features in the standards , which was then scaled to cancel those features in the fuor spectra .",
    "these spectra of fu ori and v1057 cyg are shown in the upper rows of figure 22 .",
    "the dominant features are the broad r - branch lines of the co 2 - 0 band ( r(19 ) through r(27 ) : lower ep 0.09 to 0.18 ev ) .",
    "their equivalent widths are comparable to those of early to middle - m type giants and supergiants in the atlas of @xcite , from which the fts spectrum of @xmath6 dra ( type m0 iii ) in the bottom section of figure 22 has been extracted .",
    "the same spectrum spun up to @xmath66 km s@xmath2 is shown just above . in @xmath6",
    "dra the lines of the returning r - branch ( r(75 ) through r(81 ) : lower ep 1.33 to 1.55 ev ) are strong , but they are not apparent in either fuor . although they would be masked to some degree by the greater line widths , the lack of convincing and consistent asymmetries in the fuor lines due to these blends suggest a lower rotational temperature .",
    "the co lines have different shapes in the two fuors : in fu ori they are broad and essentially symmetric , while in v1057 cyg they are asymmetric , with a narrow core and an extended wing toward negative velocities . to reduce the effects of instrumental noise and that introduced by atmospheric line removal , the line profiles shown in figure 23 were created by averaging the 4 - 5 least noisy co lines for each star .",
    "these were fitted by a procedure similar to that described in   2.3 . the instrumental profile , represented by that of a narrow atmospheric ch@xmath65 line of fwhm = 8 km s@xmath2 ,",
    "could be spun up to adjustable @xmath4 , central velocity , and central depth .",
    "the parameters of the fits are given in table 7 .",
    "although the off - center structure in fu ori may be real , a single component serves to represent the overall profile reasonably well . in the case of v1057 cyg ,",
    "the observed profile is certainly _ not _ a narrower version of the stellar absorption lines .",
    "formally , it can be fitted to two overlapping , rotationally broadened copies of the atmospheric line . because of the complex structure , comparison of these @xmath4 s with the optical value can not be very meaningful .    in neither",
    "star is there any evidence of shell structure at large negative velocities , perhaps understandably because the shell spectrum in the optical was very weak at the time of the co observation .",
    "the co velocity of fu ori agrees closely with the conventional velocity of that star ( + 28 km s@xmath2 ) , in agreement with @xcite , who found  from several co and metal lines \" a value of + 28.2 @xmath13 2.5 km s@xmath2 . however , the velocities of both co components of v1057 cyg ( table 7 ) are displaced from the optical @xmath32 km s@xmath2 , nor do they agree with the mould et al .",
    "value of @xmath67 km s@xmath2 .    in the case of fu ori ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 from co ( 48 km s@xmath2 ) is clearly smaller than that we obtain from the optical region ( 70 km s@xmath2 ) , in the same sense as earlier work by the cfa group . @xcite",
    "measured total widths of cross - correlation peaks rather than @xmath4 s , so the two results can not be compared directly , except to say that they found the co lines in fu ori to be narrower than the optical by a factor of about 0.75 , as compared to our 0.69 . in v1057 cyg also , the stronger co component ( 45 km s@xmath2 ) is narrower than the optical total @xmath4 of 55 km s@xmath2 , but this may not be significant because the co profiles are peculiar .",
    "the only published cfa result for co in v1057 cyg is an estimate that @xmath4 is about 20 km s@xmath2 @xcite .      in t tauri stars ( tts ) , a period of axial rotation",
    "can be derived from rotational modulations of brightness and line profiles caused by surface inhomogeneities ( cool or hot spots ) and nonaxisymmetric structure of the wind ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unlike an ordinary star , an accretion disk has no single rotational period but a range of keplerian orbital periods . in the accretion disk models for fu ori and v1057 cyg @xcite , the keplerian periods range from 34 days for the inner disk where the f - type spectrum is formed , to 3040 days for the outer regions contributing to the m - type spectrum .",
    "thus an observational test would be to search for rotational modulation in the wind , emission and photospheric line profiles .",
    "the most prominent wind feature is the h@xmath3 p cyg line .",
    "the emission lines of metals are present only in the spectrum of v1057 cyg and are too weak to be used in such an analysis because the individual spectra of v1057 cyg near minimum brightness are rather noisy .",
    "the photospheric lines , although also being weak , can however be analyzed by cross - correlation , which compensates for the poor signal - to - noise ratio of the individual spectra .",
    "figures 24 and 25 show overplotted all the h@xmath3 profiles from the sofin data of 19952001 for v1057 cyg and fu ori , the latter in two parts to emphasize the major changes in the longward emission component . the left panel is a superposition of all the profiles of fu ori in which the emission peak intensity was greater than 1.20 ( in continuum units ) , and the right panel all those with peak less than 1.10 . as already mentioned , there is no obvious correlation between these emission peak intensities and the extension of the p cyg absorption component to negative velocities .",
    "the time scale of the variability is different in the two objects . in v1057 cyg",
    ", the night - to - night variability is relatively small , but the average profile is quite different in different years ( see also fig .  7 ) . in both objects ,",
    "most variable is the central emission peak and the portion of the profile between about @xmath43 and @xmath17 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the same variations are seen in the p cyg absorptions of the d@xmath68 lines , which correlate well with h@xmath3 , although the lines have a somewhat smaller range in wind velocity .",
    "the absorption at the infrared lines also vary together with h@xmath3 and but the velocity amplitude is much smaller .",
    "h@xmath3 was chosen for analysis because it showed the largest range in wind velocity .    in fu",
    "ori , the line profiles change considerably on a time scale of a day ( as was noted most recently by * ? ? ?",
    "* who give earlier references ) .",
    "the following variability patterns are seen in the h@xmath3 profile on sofin spectra : ( 1 ) there is no correlation between the changes of the absorption and emission components ( we return to this matter in the following section ) .",
    "( 2 ) three sections of the absorption component vary independently of one another : ( a ) a  slow wind \" at rv = @xmath69 to @xmath46 km s@xmath2 , ( b ) a  fast wind \" at @xmath46 to @xmath70 km s@xmath2 , ( c ) an even faster wind at @xmath70 to @xmath17 km s@xmath2 .",
    "( 3 ) the fast wind portion shows quasi - periodic variations in ew , but ( 4 ) no periodicity is found in the emission component of h@xmath3 .    the dense time coverage of the sofin spectroscopy makes feasible a search for periodicity , so the ew of the p cyg absorption between @xmath46 and @xmath70 km s@xmath2 was used as a parameter of the fast wind of fu ori .",
    "those ews are listed in table 8 .",
    "the phase dispersion minimization method @xcite was used to search for periodicity in these data . when the velocities of only three seasons , 1997 to 1999 , are examined ( 20 nights ) , the periodogram ( fig .",
    "26 , upper panel ) shows a group of significant peaks at 1318 days , with the most probable value being 14.847 days .",
    "fisher s method of randomization @xcite gives a false alarm probability ( fap ) of @xmath240.01 for that period .",
    "there are no other significant periods between 2 and 100 days .",

    "26 , lower panel ) shows that that period is defined largely by the 1997 and 1998 data .",
    "the data of 1999 also fit , but span a shorter phase interval .",

    "@xcite have recently published h@xmath3 profiles of fu ori obtained over 5 consecutive nights in january 1999 .",
    "the variations in the p cyg absorption ( measured by them as velocity width at an intermediate depth ) indicated that if periodicity was present , the period could be about 68 days , shorter by a factor 2 than found from our more extended set of ew measurements . considering that our observations in 2000 show no periodicity",
    ", it may be that the 14.8 day cycle had already become undetectable in 1999 .",
    "our own data of october 1999 ( 4 nights ) are too limited to pronounce upon the presence of a 68 day cycle in that year .",
    "we conclude that the variations of the wind absorption in fu ori are quasi - periodic : in 199798 the period was 14.8 days but that periodicity had disappeared by 2000 .",
    "@xcite suggested that these cyclic variations in the wind of fu ori are caused by the interaction of the stellar magnetic field with the disk outflow , assuming that the magnetic axis of the star is inclined to the disk rotational axis .",
    "however , in that model of an inclined magnetic rotator one would expect rather stable periodicity on a very long time scale .",
    "instead , the _ quasi - periodic _ character of the variations is more like that observed in tts , where surface inhomogeneities ( spots ) may appear and disappear due to changes in the star s magnetic field structure .",
    "we suggest that the longer period of 14.8 days suggested by the h@xmath3 variations ( because that line showed the largest velocity amplitude ) is the rotational period of fu ori . in case",
    "the wind is governed by the star s magnetic field ( as is believed to be the case in tts ) , a relatively stable axial asymmetry of the field structure might cause the observed rotational modulation over at least two years ( 1997 - 98 ) , or 50 rotational cycles .",
    "the observed @xmath1 km s@xmath2 then leads to a value of r sin @xmath7 = 20.4 r@xmath8 .    in the accretion disk model for fu ori ( @xcite )",
    "a period of 14.8 days corresponds to a keplerian orbit of radius 20 r@xmath8 , where the k - type spectrum is supposed to be formed , but it is not clear why a global disk wind should be modulated with any single period .",
    "if the intrinsic optical colors of fu ori are those of a normal g0 ib , then the observed values for the 2000 season ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) correspond to @xmath73 , so if the reddening is normal , the average @xmath74 is 1.38 mag .",
    ", leading to @xmath75 for the assumed distance of 450 pc .",
    "the visual flux in solar units is    @xmath76    if only a fraction @xmath77 of the surface is occupied by regions having the g0 ib brightness , then the radius of such a spherical star is    @xmath78    where @xmath79 (= 0.7 ) is the ratio of surface brightnesses at v calculated by the procedure of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath77 = 1 , the result is that r = 11.3 r@xmath8 .    consider whether this last result can be reconciled with r sin @xmath7 = 20.4 r@xmath8 .",
    "if the star s surface brightness is not uniform , then any value of the coverage factor @xmath77 @xmath80 0.32 could bring the two into agreement , the inclination then following from sin @xmath7 = ( 20.4/11.3)@xmath81 .    another possibility : if the a@xmath48 inferred from the color excess of fu ori were ignored and instead taken to be 2.66 mag .",
    ", regarded as the sum of conventional interstellar reddening in the foreground and a circumstellar component of unspecified reddening properties , then m@xmath48 would become -1.3 and r = 20.4 r@xmath8 , in agreement with the axial rotation result for sin @xmath7 = 1 .",
    "if the entire a@xmath48 was circumstellar , then a@xmath48/e(b - v ) = 5.4 , compared to the normal interstellar value of 3.1 .",
    "a / e ratios greater than about 4.0 are not unprecedented , having been found in dusty regions and in dense molecular clouds @xcite , there usually being ascribed to the presence of larger particles .",
    "that may not be inconceivable in the case of fu ori because the local reddening of such a dusty object need not obey the normal interstellar extinction law .",
    "but there must surely be a normal interstellar contribution to a@xmath48 , in which case the a / e ratio of the circumstellar component would become even larger , as it also would if sin @xmath7 @xmath24 1.0 for fu ori .",
    "so either hypothesis could reconcile the two results .",
    "we see no strong observational reason to favor one hypothesis over the other at this time , except that the dust explanation does require circumstellar extinction of unusual properties .",
    "the periodic variation in wind strength observed in fu ori , with its implication of unevenly distributed active areas , favors the blotchy surface hypothesis .",
    "if precise photometry showed that fu ori varies cyclically with that same period , it would strengthen that proposition .",
    "dust formation low in the atmosphere , leading to a larger a@xmath48 and an abnormal a / e and subsequent ejection , might explain dust structure very near the star .",
    "but at this time the question remains open .",
    "as remarked earlier , the double - peaked profiles of ( some ) photospheric lines have been used as one of the arguments in support of the accretion - disk model of fuors ( hk ) .",
    "so far , no spectral time series have been available to determine how stable is this peculiar line structure , which we attribute (   2.4 ) to the presence of emission cores in the low - excitation lines . in our spectral series of v1057 cyg and fu ori ( sofin data of 19952001 )",
    "this line structure is found to be variable on a time scale of several days . in the following",
    "we use the cross - correlation method to give information about line profiles averaged over a certain spectral region , usually one spectral order .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath15 aqr ( g0 ib ) is used as a template .    as an example , figures 27 and 28 show night - to - night variability of the cross - correlation functions ( ccf s ) during one set of observations of v1057 cyg and fu ori .",
    "the ccf profile varies synchronously in different spectral regions : the line width at half - depth remains about the same , while the central part varies with either shortward or longward peak being stronger , sometimes becoming single and quite symmetric .",
    "of course the ccf profile depends on the particular mix of low- and high - excitation lines in the sample , and this may be why different spectral orders show somewhat different ccf shapes , but the variations are similar in different orders .",
    "the spectral intervals selected for cross - correlation were chosen to avoid lines with shell components .    as a descriptor of line position we use the  center of gravity \" of the ccf , namely its weighted mean radial velocity .",
    "this is the velocity of the star as if it had been measured from the  center of gravity \" of a photospheric line profile , although variations of this quantity do not necessarily mean that the whole star moves around in radial velocity .    in the case of v1057",
    "cyg two spectral orders ( 63206440 and 65756640  ) were combined ; the resulting precision of rv is about @xmath133 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the spectra of fu ori are of better quality , so 6 spectral orders ( from 5560 to 7520  ) were used , the resulting precision being @xmath131 km s@xmath2 .",
    "table 9 contains the measured rv s for both stars .",
    "since the individual ccfs are quite noisy , especially for v1057 cyg , three groups of ccfs showing similar rvs were selected : shortward - shifted , centered , and longward - shifted .",
    "the three ccfs shown in figure 29 are averages for these three groups , overplotted to illustrate typical variations of the ccf profile . for v1057 cyg",
    "each ccf is an average of 8 spectra , for fu ori each is an average of four . obviously , the main source of the variability is the deformation of the central part of the line profile : the ratio of shortward - to - longward peak intensity is variable , while the width of the line remains about the same .",
    "this latter fact excludes the possibility of a double - line binary , where the line width must be narrower when the two components have the same radial velocity .    for fu",
    "ori , the periodogram shown in the upper panel of figure 30 was calculated using the data of the 1997 , 1998 and 1999 seasons ( 20 nights ) .",
    "the most probable period is 3.542 days , with fap @xmath24 0.01 .",
    "when phased with this period , the lower panel of figure 30 shows the cyclic variation of rv in these three years .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the sinusoidal variations of rv is 1.8 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the scatter of points around the sinusoidal curve is less than @xmath131 km s@xmath2 , which must be entirely due to the errors in rv . when all the data of 19952000 are used ( 29 nights ) , the period is still present but the data of 2000 are not well fit to the sinusoidal curve . it is concluded that the period of 3.542 days in the photospheric lines of fu ori was stable during at least three years .    for v1057 cyg , using all the data of 19952001 ( 42 nights )",
    ", the periodogram reveals a group of peaks around 4.44.5 days , with the most probable period being 4.43 days .",
    "however , the semi - amplitude of the rv variations ( 3 km s@xmath2 ) is comparable to the errors in rv ( 3 km s@xmath2 ) , which makes it unlikely that the periodicity is real , so we draw no conclusions from this result .",
    "the nature of such variations in the photospheric line structure is not clear . in the case of a single star",
    ", variations like those shown in figure 29 can be caused by an asymmetric polar starspot .",
    "however , a dark spot must also modulate the apparent stellar brightness .",
    "no such variation has been reported for fu ori .",
    "since the photospheric line doubling is due to the presence of emission cores , variations in the doubling may be caused by movement of those cores .",
    "it is also possible that the line emission originates from a volume of gas distributed non - axisymmetrically around the star .",
    "such  emission spots \" could also produce a rotational modulation of the photospheric line profile . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wind cycle of 14.8 days is the rotational period , it is hard to explain why the period of the photospheric variations is 4 times shorter .    in case of the accretion disk model @xcite ,",
    "a period of 3.542 days corresponds to keplerian rotation at a distance of 7.7 r@xmath8 ( if the mass of the central star is 0.5 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is the innermost part of the disk , where the f - type spectrum is supposed to be formed .",
    "if variability of the photospheric lines is caused by some kind of brightness asymmetry in the disk , the stability of such an asymmetry over three years ( 300 orbital periods ) would be difficult to understand in a differentially rotating disk .",
    "apart from the deformation of the line profiles , small shifts of the ccf can be noticed in v1057 cyg ( fig .",
    "29 ) : the change in the shortward - to - longward peak intensity is accompanied by shifts of the entire ccf profile by a few km s@xmath2 . if these shifts are real , and not an artifact of cross - correlating noisy spectra , it could indicate the presence of a low mass secondary near the star .",
    "series of better quality spectra are needed to check whether this effect is really present .",
    "@xcite have inferred the presence of hotspots on the rotating tts df tau by an analysis of such cyclic deformations of absorption line profiles .",
    "those hotspots , which they suggest are accretion shocks at mass - infall points , are clearly hotter than any of those on the classical fuors , where there is no sign of the lines at 5875 or 7065   in emission .",
    "our new spectroscopic material refutes a concern that we raised in 1992 , namely that there was then no direct spectroscopic evidence of infall in fuors , such as  reversed p cyg \" structure .",
    "disk theory yields an accretion rate onto the fuor central star of about 10@xmath82 m / m@xmath8 yr@xmath2 @xcite , as compared to @xmath010@xmath83 m / m@xmath8 yr@xmath2 for classical t tauri stars ( ctts .",
    "one would think that the movement of such massive amounts of material on to the star would surely be detectable .",
    "the disk hypothesis has been extensively elaborated since hk and a number of possible explanations have been offered for the lack of evidence for infall : ( a ) much of the accreted material may be ejected from the disk surface as wind , and so never reaches the star ; or ( b ) the accreting mass may accumulate in the disk ; or ( c ) the central source may be so faint that absorption lines would not be detectable against its continuum ; or ( d ) the disk may be so thick at its inner edge that any activity nearer the star is concealed ( in fact @xcite [ @xcite ] predict that at an accretion rate of 10@xmath82 m / m@xmath8 yr@xmath2 `` the entire stellar surface is engulfed by opaque disk gas '' ) ; or ( e ) an optically thin infall region may be hidden not because of disk thickness but because these fuors are observed at unfavorable aspect angles .    however , as a result of the detailed time coverage at sofin , evidence of what appears to be sporadic infall onto the continuum source can now be seen in the h@xmath3 profiles of both fu ori and v1057 cyg . on two ( of 29 )",
    "sofin spectra a weak absorption component appeared at about rv = + 90 km s@xmath2 in the longward wing of h@xmath3 .",
    "figure 31 shows three of these spectra , demonstrating that the feature was present on jd 2450796.68 , but not at comparable strength on the day before or two days later .",
    "the pattern was the same at h@xmath15 , and the absorption was marginally detectable at the d@xmath45 lines , but not at the @xmath6 7773 blend which in ctts is sensitive to accretion .",
    "a similar absorption had appeared at h@xmath3 at about the same velocity on jd 2450807.69 , but had been absent on the day before .",
    "clearly , these infall features in fu ori vary rapidly in strength , on a time scale of one day or less .",
    "the longward wing of the absorption in h@xmath3 extends to about + 150 km s@xmath2 , which is near the free fall velocity at the surface of a star of 1 solar mass and a radius of 20 r@xmath8 .",
    "a similar event has been seen in a hires observation of fu ori in early 2003 .    it is uncertain if the complete suppression of the longward component of h@xmath3 as seen in the right - hand panel of figure 25 can be ascribed to very heavy accretion of this kind .",
    "thus infalling material does appear sporadically in the line of sight to both fu ori and v1057 cyg , as is observed in many ctts @xcite .",
    "it is there thought to be due to magnetically - channeled , free - falling disk material .",
    "a signature of such magnetospheric accretion is the presence of emission lines of and that are believed to originate in the hot spots where infalling material impacts the star @xcite .",
    "as already noted , no such emission lines appear in any of our spectra of the classical fuors .",
    "it has been suggested that in ctts a consequence of such infall may be the ejection of herbig - haro - like jets , and it is interesting that the spacing of structure in some h - h outflows does correspond to estimates of the time spacing of repetitive fuor events in tts .",
    "a signature of such shocked gas is the presence of lines of [ ] , [ ] and sometimes [ ] @xcite .",
    "all that we have found in the integrated spectra of the fuors that we have observed are the very weak , broad [ ] and [ ] emissions in v1057 cyg (   2.4 ) .",
    "they have large negative velocities and so must be formed in the outflowing wind .",
    "the [ ] or [ ] lines are not detected , although they would be expected to be much weaker .",
    "however , no h - h - like jets are seen in the direct images of the fuors we have observed , although a search at higher angular resolution with the proper filters would be worthwhile .      an unusual feature of the pre - outburst spectrum of v1057 cyg was that although the k line ( @xmath6 3933 ) of was strong in emission , the h line ( @xmath63968 ) was absent .",
    "the obvious explanation of this oddity , as was realized long ago , is that @xmath63968 is quenched by the p cyg absorption component of h@xmath41 @xmath63970 .",
    "the important conclusions are ( a ) that 12 years _ before _ the 1970 flare - up , v1057 cyg was subject to a strong mass outflow : i.e. the high - velocity wind did not turn on at the time of the outburst ; and ( b ) that wind was seen against the spectrum of the pre - outburst star .",
    "the same anomaly was also present 28 years _",
    "after _ the flare - up : a hires spectrogram obtained 1998 october 30 , when the star was about 1 mag.(in b ) above minimum brightness , is shown in fig .",
    "it demonstrates not only that the h@xmath41 wind is indeed responsible for the k : h anomaly , but implies that such a wind may be a quasi - permanent characteristic of the object .",
    "this same wind suppression of @xmath63968 has been observed in fu ori since the time of the first adequate spectroscopy ( 1948 ) .",
    "it is seen not only in the other classical fuor that we have observed ( v1515 cyg ) but also in z cma which has been called a fuor , as well as in v1331 cyg to which attention was called long ago by @xcite for that very reason .",
    "only bbw76 @xcite does not conform : narrow emission is present in both lines . figure 32 shows hires spectra of the 39003980 region for all 6 stars .",
    "the presence of strong emission in all the fuors , both near or below maximum light , shows that a permanent chromosphere is characteristic of the group .",
    "this k : h anomaly is not a common feature of tts spectra .",
    "most tts outflows occur at modest negative velocities such that the absorption component at h@xmath3 falls within the broad underlying emission line : see the atlases of h@xmath3 profiles by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "fuor outflows are dramatically different , in that the mass involved is much larger and extends to much greater negative velocities , hence the characteristic p cyg profile and the suppression of h@xmath41 .",
    "if this k : h anomaly is indeed a fuor signature , can it be that there are unrecognized fuors among the host of ordinary tts ?",
    "there are 65 stars with emission in the atlas of tts spectra by @xcite and of these only 3 ( as 353a , lkh@xmath3 321 , v1331 cyg ) have the @xmath63968 line suppressed .",
    "the spectra of 3 additional stars apparently showing the same effect have been published by @xcite .",
    "detection of such stars by slitless spectroscopy would be an efficient means of searching for new fuor candidates .",
    "before the 1970 outburst , v1057 cyg was only one of some fifty faint h@xmath3-emission stars scattered over the ngc 7000-ic 5070 region .",
    "since it seemed to be just another tts  on the slender evidence of that single pre - outburst low - resolution slit spectrogram ",
    "it was suggested in @xcite and then again in @xcite that such outbursts might be a characteristic of tts in general .",
    "if so , from the number of such outbursts that had been detected ( 3 at that time ) and a guess as to how many tts exist within an observable distance around the sun , it was estimated that  the mean time between successive fu ori - like outbursts in an individual t tau star \" is about 10@xmath84 years .",
    "that estimate has since been refined by others but the basic concept has survived .",
    "as appealing as that idea is , and the way it can be worked into a larger picture of pre - main sequence evolution @xcite , it was a pure conjecture .",
    "consider these points :    first , if every tts is a potential and presumably recurrent fuor , then fuors would be expected to appear in clusters or associations rich in tts .",
    "none of the classical fuors occur in the orion nebula , around @xmath39 oph , or in other regions containing large numbers of tts .",
    "v1057 cyg lies in an isolated dark cloud containing only one other very faint h@xmath3 emitter , no other tts have been found in the elongated streamer northwest of ic 5146 where v1735 cyg is located , while v1515 cyg is one of several h@xmath3 emitters scattered over an extended obscured region .",
    "bbw76 is alone in a small dark cloud , with no known tts in the vicinity .",
    "there are exceptions , however : there are a number of tts near the small dark cloud b35 in which fu ori lies , and the heavily obscured l1551 irs 5 is located in a loose grouping of tts at the southern edge of the taurus clouds",
    ". another possible exception may be the candidate fuor cb34v which , according to @xcite , appears to lie on the near side of a heavily obscured aggregate of young stars .",
    "second , it was pointed out above (   4.6 ) that at minimum light , some 12 years before the outburst , v1057 cyg exhibited the same strong outflowing wind that it has shown ever since the flare - up .",
    "the same p cyg structure at h@xmath3 is found in other fuors observed near maximum light .",
    "such vigorous mass ejection is not a property of ordinary tts , which is the reason it has become to be regarded as an indicator of fuor group membership .",
    "third , others have noted that fuors tend to have large values of @xmath4 .",
    "even higher than the @xmath85 sin @xmath7 s found here for v1057 cyg ( 55 km s@xmath2 ) and fu ori ( 70 km s@xmath2 ) is the @xmath86 145 @xmath13 20 km s@xmath2 reported by @xcite for the candidate fuor cb34v .",
    "fuors clearly have significantly higher rotational velocities than most tts , although a minority of tts are also rapid rotators : four of some 60 tts listed by @xcite and by @xcite have @xmath87 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we are encouraged to believe that rapid rotation is an essential characteristic of the fuor phenomenon .",
    "there is another property that , at first , would seem to distinguish fuors from most conventional tts .",
    "@xcite noted that all the fuors recognized at that time were located at the edge of either a complete loop or ring of reflection nebulosity ; in some cases only a section of the loop is seen as a curved arc terminating at the star .",
    "in addition to the well - known outer arcs at v1057 cyg , the hst images in figure 15 show two curved filaments ( a and b ) that could be part of such a recently ejected loop .",
    "interestingly , v1331 cyg and z cma ( both of which show the k : h anomaly ) , as well as bbw76 are also attached to such nebulae .",
    "but so are seemingly unrelated stars like su aur and ab aur ( @xmath4 about 65 km s@xmath2 and 80 km s@xmath2 , respectively ) , showing that the presence of such a nebula is not exclusively a fuor signature , but may rather be the consequence of a very large @xmath88 .",
    "these reasons encourage the speculation that fuor events may not be a property of ordinary tts , but may be confined to a special rapidly rotating sub - species among them .",
    "but if the fuor phenomenon is in fact favored in a certain kind of pre - main sequence object , it raises the question : what could be special about stars that so often occur in isolation , in contrast to those formed in groups or clusters ?",
    "in @xcite , following a study of a high - resolution spectrogram of fu ori obtained in 1987 , we asserted that that spectrum could be reproduced by an emission - line shell ( which in the present paper we call a ` chromosphere ' ) overlain by a rising , cooler absorbing layer ( now the ` shell ' ) atop a g - type supergiant absorption spectrum whose lines were broadened by macroturbulence + rotation .",
    "it was also pointed out that some of the spectroscopic properties of fuors that have been argued as proof of the accretion disk picture ( line doubling , the presence of co bands in the near infrared , the possession of an ir excess ) are found in a number of much older high - luminosity stars where there is no reason whatsoever to think that an accretion disk is present .",
    "the new sofin and hires spectroscopy was intended to reexamine those assertions . with respect to the three issues critical to the accretion disk hypothesis that were raised in   1 , our conclusions are :    \\(a )",
    "the emission cores responsible for the ` doubling ' of low - excitation absorption lines that have become more apparent as v1057 cyg has faded clearly are produced in a low - temperature chromosphere .",
    "we believe that it is they that caused those absorption lines to appear double when the star was brighter .",
    "presumably such chromospheres are present in the other classical fuors as well , judging from the ubiquity of @xmath63933 emission .",
    "\\(b ) we have been unable to confirm , with superior spectroscopic material , the dependence of @xmath4 upon either wavelength or lower ep that has been urged as evidence for the accretion disk model .",
    "however we do agree that the co lines in the 2 @xmath11 m region of fu ori are narrower than are optical lines shortward of 0.9 @xmath11 m ; the situation for v1057 cyg is uncertain .",
    "whether this is unarguable support for the disk hypothesis is not clear : it would be interesting to determine if the same effect appears in the co lines of normal g supergiants .",
    "\\(c ) synthetic disk spectra that resemble fuors at optical wavelengths fail to match certain critical lines in the near infrared , indicating that syntheses such as those described in   4.1 can no longer be regarded as firm support for the disk hypothesis , although some elaboration of that hypothesis might reduce the discrepancies .",
    "the point is that we find that some of the _ observational _ evidence that has been offered in support of the disk hypothesis can either be explained in another way or can not be confirmed .",
    "although details are somewhat different , the proposal of @xcite and of @xcite is strengthened : namely , that the observable properties of the classic fuors are better explained by a single star rotating near the limit of stability and losing mass via a powerful wind , as was originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "on slender evidence , v1057 cyg is assumed to have been a classical tts before the 1970 outburst .",
    "although by 1999 it had declined to about 1.5 mag .",
    "( in b ) above minimum , the spectrum still ( by 2002 ) has not begun to resemble that of a conventional ctts . in time",
    "it may do so , and some of the issues raised here may be resolved .",
    "meanwhile , it is important that the star be monitored spectroscopically on a regular basis .",
    "we are much indebted to the late v. shevchenko and to m. ibrahimov for providing us with their fuor photometry , to keith budge , lee hartmann , ken hinkle and karl stapelfeldt for material which we have found very useful in the course of this investigation , to ted simon for assistance with the co data , to ilya ilyin for assistance with the sofin observations , and to bo reipurth for helpful comments .",

    "<S> high - resolution spectroscopy was obtained of the fuors fu ori and v1057 cyg between 1995 and 2002 with the sofin spectrograph at not and with hires at keck i. during these years fu ori remained about 1 mag.(in b ) below its 193839 maximum brightness , but v1057 cyg ( b @xmath0 10.5 at peak in 197071 ) faded from about 13.5 to 14.9 and then recovered slightly . </S>",
    "<S> their photospheric spectra resemble that of a rotationally broadened , slightly veiled supergiant of about type g0 ib , with @xmath1 km s@xmath2 for fu ori , and 55 km s@xmath2 for v1057 cyg . as v1057 cyg faded , p cyg structure in h@xmath3 and the ir lines strengthened , and a complex shortward - displaced shell spectrum of low - excitation lines of the neutral metals ( including and ) increased in strength , disappeared in 1999 , and reappeared in 2001 . </S>",
    "<S> several sofin runs extended over a number of successive nights so that a search for rapid and cyclic changes in the spectra was possible . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra show rapid night - to - night changes in the wind structure of fu ori at h@xmath3 , including clear evidence of sporadic infall . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width of the p cyg absorption varied cyclically with a period of 14.8 days , with phase stability maintained over 3 seasons . </S>",
    "<S> this is believed to be the rotation period of fu ori . </S>",
    "<S> the internal structure of its photospheric lines also varies cyclically , but with a period of 3.54 days . </S>",
    "<S> a similar variation may be present in v1057 cyg , but the data are much noisier and that result uncertain . as v1057 cyg has faded and the continuum level fallen , the emission lines of a pre - existing low - excitation chromosphere have emerged . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we believe that the ` line doubling ' in v1057 cyg is produced by these central emission cores in the absorption lines , not by orbital motion in an inclined keplerian disk . </S>",
    "<S> no dependence of @xmath4 on wavelength or excitation potential was detected in either fu ori or v1057 cyg , again contrary to expectation for a self - luminous accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> it was found also that certain critical lines in the near infrared are not accounted for by synthetic disk spectra . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that a rapidly rotating star near the edge of stability , as proposed by larson ( 1980 ) , can better account for these observations . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility is also considered that fuor eruptions are not a property of ordinary t tauri stars , but may be confined to a special sub - species of rapidly rotating pre - main sequence stars having powerful quasi - permanent winds . </S>"
