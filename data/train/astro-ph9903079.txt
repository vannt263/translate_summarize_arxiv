    "multi - color photometry can provide accurate sed information of low spectral resolution for a large sample of objects and is a very powerful tool to deal with many important astrophysical problems .",
    "it can be used to measure the photometric red - shift of quasars and galaxies , and to select quasars and other interesting objects based on their characterstic seds .",
    "one can also use seds for stellar population synthesis , an important tool for studying the structure and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the more passbands in which one observes , the better one can determine the sed .    the beijing - arizona - taipei - connecticut ( batc ) multicolor photometric survey is designed to obtain as much information on the sed of celestial sources possible .",
    "it combines the beijing astronomical observatory s 60/90 cm f/3 schmidt telescope with a ford aerospace ccd of 2048@xmath02048 pixels ( recently replaced by a thinned loral ccd , thanks to the steward observatory ) and 15 intermediate - band filters ranging from 320 nm to 1000 nm to obtain the seds for all objects down to @xmath1 mag in a field of one square degree .",
    "a key problem in the survey is calibrate accurately the sed of our objects .",
    "the standard procedure of sed calibration is as follows : on photometric nights , we observe through the 15 batc filters both oke & gunn ( 1983 ) spectroscopic standard stars ( hd19445 , hd84937 , bd+26@xmath22606 and bd+17@xmath24708 ) , and the target fields . we convolve the known fluxes of the standard stars with the transmission curves of the batc filters to determine magnitudes in batc photometric system ( fan et al .",
    "1996 , zheng al . 1999 ) . in practice",
    ", however , this method is not very efficient , for two reasons .",
    "first , the calibrations are not always taken on perfectly photometric nights .",
    "this results in systematic troughs or bumps in the sed for all objects in a field .",
    "second , in order to obtain accurate sed calibration for 15 passbands , we need many photometric nights , which could take a very long time at our present site . in order to solve these problems",
    ", we are developing a technique we call `` sed self - calibration '' .",
    "this is a statistical method , based on applying a stellar sed library to a large sample of observed stellar objects . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe our method of sed self - calibration . in section 3",
    "we present some results from tests of the method .",
    "we discussions the method and give our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the batc survey covers regions at high galactic latitudes . in a typical field ,",
    "several thousand objects are detected per square degree . among them are several hundred unsaturated , bright stars with high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "these `` good '' stars of highly precise photometry form a big sample which is the observational basis for the sed auto - calibration method . in order to make the description concise , we will use , in the following presentation , the term @xmath3 to express the sed of an object which is calibrated by observations , and the term @xmath4 to express the sed of the same object which is the closest match found in the sed library .",
    "we assume that most of these `` good '' stars are normal , nearby stars ; therefore , most of these `` good '' stars should have very close matches in the sed libraries . if the field has been well calibrated by observations , the rms of the differences between the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 for most of the `` good '' stars should be roughly the size of the photometric precision .",
    "if the rms of the residuals is considerably larger than the photometric precision , then either some of the `` good '' stars might not actually be normal stars , or observations in some passbands might not have been made during truly photometric nights . in the former case",
    ", we can reject those stars with abnormal residuals from the data sample and repeat the process . in the later case",
    ", we can shift the zero points for some passbands which show systematic deviations of @xmath3 from @xmath4 .",
    "we iterate these processes until the rms of the residual reaches the level of the photometric precision , which is about 0.01 mag for `` good '' stars .",
    "this self - calibration method is based on the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "most bright stellar objects in the field are normal stars whose seds can be found in the sed library .",
    "the interstellar extinction of these bright stars is small and the differences in extinction between stars in the same ccd field is negligible .",
    "the sed library is reliable and covers all the required types of spectral and luminosity classes to fit the @xmath3 .",
    "we now describe briefly details of the observed and model spectra energy distributions .",
    "first , we must obtain @xmath3 for all the objects in the target field . once a target field has been observed in several passbands ,",
    "we can obtain the instrumental colors of the stars in the field by using standard photometry packages , such as daophot .",
    "the zero point for each passband is obtained through observations of oke & gunn standards during photometric nights .",
    "as long as the zero points are well - determined , the instrumental magnitudes can be transferred into the calibrated magnitudes of the batc system .",
    "the instrumental color index can be defined as in table 1 , where @xmath5 is the instrument color index of jth band minus sth band of the ith object .",
    "here we use the @xmath6th band as the reference band    .table of the instrumental color index [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the process of matching @xmath3 to @xmath4 produces as a byproduct a spectral classification for each star ; or , if a library of theoretical models is used , the stellar atmospheric parameters of each star .",
    "it provides us with an indirect way to test the method presented in this paper .",
    "figure 1 shows a good correlation between the original spectral class of stars in the vilnius catalog , and the spectral class determined for those stars via our method , using the gunn & stryker library for @xmath4 .",
    "\\1 . our method is a statistical one , so it can only be effectively applied to a large stellar sample .",
    "the batc survey satisfies this condition .",
    "each batc field covers about one square degree .",
    "typically , there are more than 4000 objects detected in each image .",
    "we are guaranteed several hundred bright and unsaturated stars with reliable instrumental magnitudes to use as a `` good '' star sample .",
    "the basis of our method is fitting the observed stellar sed to a library of stellar seds .",
    "our assumption that most of our `` good '' stars are normal stars appears firm . and",
    "their seds can be found from the sed library .",
    "most of abnormal stars are rejected during of the iteration process .",
    "the sed library is a key for the method .",
    "there is a great demand in the astronomical community for reliable sed libraries which cover a wide range in wavelength and stellar type , the theoretical libraries ( e.g. kurucz 1993 ) are limited by our knowledge of stellar physics .",
    "the theoretical seds for late type , low - temperature stars is not as reliable as those for hot stars .",
    "there are many observational stellar libraries ( gunn & stryker , vilnius , etc ) , but differences among them exist .",
    "it is not easy to judge which one is the best . after comparing various stellar sed libraries",
    "we have collected from the literature , we are at present using mostly the gunn & stryker library in our calculations .",
    "further work on making good libraries of seds is necessary .",
    "\\4 . in principle , interstellar extinction must be considered in the final result .",
    "our method of sed correction takes into account not only terrestrial atmospheric extinction , but also interstellar reddening .",
    "if standard stars or spectral models suffer from systematically more or less ( or different ) extinction than a survey s target stars , our method will yield systematically incorrect zero - point corrections to the photometry of target stars .",
    "this is because the method uses a fitting process to fit the observational sed affected by the reddening to the theoretical sed unaffected by the reddening . in the batc survey , the fields are located at high galactic latitudes , where the interstellar extinction is much reduced .",
    "we therefore use only bright stars , which are nearby and little affected by interstellar extinction , as standards for the survey fields .",
    "\\(1 ) we have tried different filter bands as the reference band to see if the change in the reference band affects the results .",
    "our results show that the difference in the final constant corrections is less than 0.01 mag .",
    "this means that the choice of reference band in color index is not important . normally , we select the band of deepest exposure as the reference band , since it has highest signal to noise ratio .",
    "this also allows the measurement of color index for as many stars as possible .",
    "\\(2 ) we wanted to know if the number of the filters used affects the results , and what is the minimum number of colors required to make the sed self - calibration work effectively . in order to do the test , we reduced the number of filters by taking off some of the color indexes .",
    "we found that the method still yields reasonable results .",
    "obviously , the results improve when one uses a larger number of the filter bands , and a wider range of wavelengths .",
    "we wanted to know if the final results depend on the characteristics of the `` good '' stars , which we used for the sed self - calibration .",
    "for this purpose , we used various randomly selected subsets of the `` good '' stars in each image .",
    "we obtained very similar color correction constants .",
    "furthermore , we divided the `` good '' stars sample into several sub - groups according to their apparent magnitude .",
    "the results show that the difference among different groups is about 0.03 mag .",
    "one possible reason is the low signal - to - noise ratio of faint stars .",
    "\\(4 ) does the choice of the initial value of the iteration affect the results ?",
    "our tests show that different initial values normally only affect the convergence time of iteration .",
    "the difference on the final result is less than 0.01 mag . in some cases",
    ", there are several minima and the process may not iterate to the right one ; this is an open issue . the best way to solve this problem , from our experiences ,",
    "is that if one or a few color indexes are very well determined by observations taken during photometric nights , then we keep these indexes fixed .",
    "this causes the iteration always to converge to the right minimum .",
    "after many tests and applications to real data , we conclude that , though there are still some problems requiring further development ( such as creating larger libraries of stellar seds ) , the method presented here can work well : the accuracy of the sed calibration is comparable to the precision of the ccd photometry .",
    "a by - product of our method is the automatic classification of the stellar type or the determination of the stellar parameters , which is very useful for the studies of galactic structure via large field multi - color ccd photometry survey .",
