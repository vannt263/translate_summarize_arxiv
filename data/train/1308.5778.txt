    "microtubules exhibit an intrinsic property whereby they switch between states of growth and shrinkage constantly . in the growing state ,",
    "@xmath0 tubulin dimeric units with @xmath1 tubulin carrying rapidly hydrolyzable gtp are added to the tip , thereby increasing the microtubule length . since",
    ", microtubule lattice with gtp -bound tubulin is more stable than the one with gdp ( guanosine diphosphate)-bound tubulin , hydrolysis leaves the microtubule unstable and eventually causes depolymerization of polymer . in the depolymerizing state ,",
    "the hydrolyzed dimeric units are lost from the tip and results in shrinkage of microtubule .",
    "thus , a given microtubule in a population would appear to be in either growing state or shrinking state , with alternate transitions between these two states .",
    "a third state called  pause \" has been observed both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    ", where a microtubule neither grows or shrinks .",
    "the gtp cap theory successfully explained the stochastic nature of microtubule dynamics , according to which a growing filament is characterized by the presence of a cap of gtp tubulin at its tip .",
    "the filament will keep growing as long as this cap is intact , even if most of the tubulin in the interior is in gdp bound , hydrolyzed state . upon the loss of this temporary gtp cap by spontaneous and irreversible hydrolysis ,",
    "the gdp rich region becomes exposed and the polymer undergoes depolymerization .",
    "this transition from a growing state to shrinking state is known as _",
    "catastrophe_. the reverse could happen , when the cap reappears at the tip either by addition of gtp - bound dimers or by exposure of a gtp remnant within , which leads to a transition from shrinking state to growing state :",
    "this is known as _",
    "rescue_. this collective dynamic behavior of a microtubule , consisting of alternating catastrophe and rescue events is known as _ dynamic instability _ @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of dynamic instability , which is the highlight of microtubule dynamics , is a key to understand microtubule dependent functions in biological systems @xcite .",
    "the gtp cap theory itself does not specify the structure of the cap itself . as the microtubule itself consists of a number ( usually 13 ) of protofilaments arranged in parallel , it is conceivable that some of the protofilaments will be gtp - tipped , while some will not be .",
    "it is a matter of debate as to how many protofilaments are required to be gtp - tipped so as to define a cap ; all 13 or less ? and even in the former case",
    ", the gtp region at the tip will have , in general , variable lengths across different protofilaments .",
    "how do we define the length of the cap , in such a situation ? _ in vitro _",
    "experimental studies performed using the slowly hydrolyzable gtp analogue gmpcpp by caplow et al . have estimated the size of the gtp cap necessary to stabilize the polymer and it has been shown that a single layer of gtp tubulin at the tip is sufficient @xcite . later on , the experimental observations at nanoscale resolution by schek et al .",
    "suggest that the cap consists of multilayer of gtp tubulin with an exponentially distributed multilayer gtp cap @xcite .",
    "but _ in vivo _ , the exact definition of cap that explains whether it requires capping of all the thirteen protofilaments or not remains uncertain .",
    "therefore , a more quantitatively precise characterization of the gtp cap theory and its implications for microtubule dynamics requires development of physical and mathematical models based on it , and comparison of the predictions of such models with experimental observations .",
    "a large variety of approaches have been adopted to tackle the problem of microtubule dynamics based on the gtp cap theory @xcite , which differ essentially in the level of molecular details included in the respective models . as recently discussed by margolin et al .",
    "@xcite , the results from all models , by parameter tuning , appear to agree with available experimental observations irrespective of the details of microtubule structure included , and irrespective of the differences in mathematical expressions for ( primarily ) the frequency of catastrophe or related quantities .",
    "we feel that a comparative study of at least some of the models , from a common starting point , is desirable , and this is one of the objectives of this paper .",
    "we chose the complete stochastic model , first proposed by flyvbjerg et al .",
    "@xcite as this starting point , as this model appears to be fairly successful in reproducing many ob served features of microtubule catastrophe , from a purely kinetic point of view",
    ". however , almost all the mathematical models , including the original fhl model , are effective one - dimensional models where the microtubule is approximated to a linear polymer .",
    "they also differ in some important details : whereas some models neglect rescue altogether , some others ignore vectorial hydrolysis ; dissociation of tubulin dimers from the filament in the growing state is included in some models , but not in others . as a result ,",
    "the predictions are apparently different even across models which share a lot of similarities in their basic assumptions ; therefore , we feel that a fresh study of the stochastic model is not untimely .",
    "flyvbjerg , holy and leibler @xcite ( henceforth referred to as fhl ) formulated an effective stochastic model of microtubule catastrophes , based on the gtp cap theory . in this model ,",
    "gtp bound tubulin polymerizes to form a one dimensional filament , and may undergo hydrolysis anywhere in the polymer .",
    "two types of hydrolysis processes were considered , spontaneous and induced ( vectorial ) . while the former occurs in a gtp - bound tubulin independent of the nucleotide state of the neighbors , in the latter case , a gdp tubulin was assumed to enhance the rate of hydrolysis in a gtp - neighbor .",
    "the model made a number of predictions which compared favorably with experimental observations .",
    "in particular , the model predicted that the catastrophe frequency is a decreasing function of the growth velocity @xmath2 , and asymptotically approaches a small , constant value as @xmath3 .",
    "the latter feature was a surprising , even counter - intuitive prediction , which we will show later to be an art ifact of the continuum theory used by fhl .",
    "the fhl model inspired a number of later studies , which attempted to go beyond its limitations , notably the papers by antal et al .",
    "@xcite and padinhateeri et al .",
    "while the latter focused on frequencies of catastrophe and rescue , the former also studied statistical characteristics such as the length distributions of the gtp cap as well as the interior islands of t - mers and d - mers .",
    "similar studies have also been carried out in the context of actin filaments @xcite .",
    "we shall also give a comparison of our results with the studies by antal et al .",
    "@xcite and padinhateeri et al .",
    "@xcite in one of the later sections .",
    "the work on this paper was started with the objective of extending the fhl model in such a way so as to base it on the dynamics of individual protofilaments , and therefore to formulate it as a complete three - dimensional model of catastrophe .",
    "in doing so , we are also freed from the necessity of taking a spatially continuum approach in describing the hydrolysis process : as each protofilament is a single polymer with monomer molecules arranged linearly , a one - dimensional discrete formalism is easily implemented for the dynamics of each . in this way , local catastrophe events are defined for each protofilament ( corresponding to the loss of the gtp - tip for each ) the frequency of which is determined precisely under steady state conditions .",
    "the global / microtubule catastrophe is defined as an event that pertains to the entire microtubule , and whose onset was defined phenomenologically in terms of the number of individual protofilaments that underwent local catastrophes .",
    "this approach gives us enough flexibility with the definition of global catastrophes , so that its dynamics ( the time scale of which is much larger than the local catastrophes in each protofilament ) as well as the steady state value could be studied in detail , and compared with experiments .",
    "indeed , several experiments have highlighted the age dependence of microtubule catastrophe frequency ; in general , following nucleation or rescue , catastrophe frequency is found to increase with time and saturate at a steady state value . by comparing results from our numerical simulations with recent experimental observations , we predict that the microtubule catastrophe requires at least 2 - 3 protofilaments to have lost their gtp tips .",
    "a single protofilament in our model is a linear polymer of tubulin molecules , starting with one gtp - bound tubulin ( symbolically denoted ` t ' , and henceforth referred to as a t - mer ) .",
    "further incoming t - mers are added to the protofilament at a rate @xmath4 if it is t - tipped , and at a rate @xmath5 if it is d - tipped .",
    "the rate of spontaneous hydrolysis is denoted @xmath6 and the rate of vectorial / induced hydrolysis is denoted @xmath7 .",
    "this means that in a .... ttt ... configuration , the middle t becomes d at a rate @xmath6 , whereas in a .... dtt .. or ...",
    "dtd ... configuration , the middle t becomes d at a rate @xmath8 .",
    "we may further allow for the possibility that a t - mer may detach from the tip at a rate @xmath9 .",
    "all these possible transitions with respective rates are schematically shown in fig 1 .",
    "when the last t with a d neighbour is also lost by hydrolysis or detachment from the tip , we define the protofilament to undergo a ` local catastrophe ' . the rate at which the transition fr om growing phase to shrinking phase occurs is denoted by @xmath10 , which we refer to as the frequency of ` protofilament catastrophe ' .",
    "analogously , @xmath5 may be defined as the ` protofilament rescue ' @xcite , which we regard as a time independent constant throughout this work . of these parameters , the rates @xmath11 and @xmath5 are independent parameters which may be regarded as constants , while @xmath10 needs to be computed in terms of these , and is , in general , a time dependent quantity .",
    "the complete microtubule may be imagined as a set of 13 such protofilaments arranged side by side ( fig 2 ) .",
    "our approach in this paper is essentially kinetic in nature , and we do not propose to undertake a detailed treatment of the energetics in the problem , which has been carried out by several authors @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we do not consider explicitly the energy of interaction between protofilaments or the bending energy of individual protofilaments .",
    "hence the cylindrical structure of the entire microtubule filament is irrelevant in our model , where the microtubule ` lattice ' has a flat geometry , similar to the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to define a catastrophe event for the entire filament , we adopt the following phenomenological definition .",
    "we conjecture that when a certain minimum number @xmath12 of individual protofilaments have undergone their individual catastrophes , the entire filament becomes energetically unstable and enters the shrinking phase .",
    "therefore , this ` first passage ' event where @xmath13 protofilaments have already undergone catastrophes by time @xmath14 ( and not rescued until the time instant @xmath14 ) while the @xmath12th one undergoes catastrophe at time @xmath14 defines a catastrophe event for the filament at time @xmath14 , and denote it by @xmath15 .",
    "one of our objectives of this work is to estimate the number of protofilaments that needs to undergo local catastrophe to produce a catastrophe of the filament .",
    "let @xmath16 the probability that a protofilament has a gtp cap consisting of @xmath17 t - mers at time @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath16 evolves in time either by addition or loss of monomers .",
    "monomers are added to the tip of the cap at a rate @xmath4 .",
    "the size of the cap becomes smaller by hydrolysis of gtp to gdp at the inner boundary at rate @xmath19 , or anywhere within the cap at rate @xmath6 or by detachment of t - mer from the tip at rate @xmath9 . since the effect of detachment process is the same as that of vectorial hydrolysis , we may simply effect a replacement @xmath20 in the equations to take this into account .",
    "we assume next that a protofilament in which the cap length has shrunk to zero would undergo rescue at a rate @xmath5 , and that the rescued protofilaments continue to grow by successive addition of monomers , until it encounters the next catastrophe event .",
    "hence , to begin with , we consider an ensemble of protofilaments such that , at @xmath21 , a protofilament possess a cap with @xmath22 subunits .",
    "the cap dynamics can be summarized into the following master equation :      the distribution @xmath16 is normalized : @xmath24 at all times @xmath18 , consistent with the above equation . the third and fourth term containing @xmath6 in the equation for @xmath16 ( @xmath25 )",
    "can be explained respectively as follows .",
    "protofilaments with @xmath17 t - mers at the tip can switch to a state with tip consisting of less than @xmath17 t - mers caused by the spontaneous hydrolysis , which cuts the gtp cap in to two regions of t - mers separated by a d - mer . by the reverse process , a protofilament of cap length @xmath17 can be generated from one with a cap of length larger than @xmath17 . in this way",
    "the spontaneous hydrolysis accelerates the stochastic switching between growing and shrinking states .",
    "we now define a catastrophe event for a protofilament , and derive an expression for the frequency of occurrence of the same . in conformity with the definition given in the last section ,",
    "we define protofilament catastrophe frequency as    @xmath26    where the numerator gives the fraction of protofilaments undergoing catastrophe in the interval @xmath27 $ ] while the denominator gives the fraction that is in growing state ( i.e. , with a gtp - tip of non - zero length ) at time @xmath18 .",
    "the upper bound in eq.[eq : eq2 ] follows from normalization .",
    "the occurrence of the non - local terms in the sums in eq.[eq : eq1 ] means that finding a general solution to this equation is likely to be cumbersome .",
    "however , we note that when @xmath28 , the set of equations in eq.[eq : eq1 ] describes a ( discrete ) random walk in one dimension with a boundary condition at @xmath29 , which can be exactly solved .",
    "it is therefore logical to use a perturbative method , where the distribution @xmath16 is expanded in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "also , it can be shown by scaling arguments ( see subsection e later ) that in the asymptotic @xmath30 regime , the leading term in the expression for @xmath10 is indeed the first order perturbation term in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we now start with the expansion    @xmath31    @xmath32 , which describes dynamics without spontaneous hydrolysis , satisfies the following equations :      while @xmath34 satisfies the equations    @xmath35 + k_g[p_{n-1}^{(1)}(t)\\nonumber\\\\-p_{n}^{(1)}(t ) ] -n p_{n}^{(0)}(t)+\\sum_{m = n+1}^{\\infty } p_{m}^{(0)}(t ) , n\\geq2 \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dp_1^{(1)}(t)}{dt } = k_h[p_{2}^{(1)}(t)-p_{1}^{(1)}(t)]- k_g p_{1}^{(1)}(t)\\nonumber \\\\+\\nu_r^{\\prime } p_0^{(1)}(t)-p_{1}^{(0)}(t)+\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty } p_{m}^{(0)}(t)\\nonumber\\\\   \\frac{dp_0^{(1)}(t)}{dt } = k_hp_{1}^{(1)}(t)-\\nu_r^{\\prime } p_0^{(1)}(t)+\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty } p_{m}^{(0)}(t ) .",
    "\\label{eq : eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    further , normalization needs to be satisfied for all @xmath6 , which requires that @xmath36 while @xmath37 for @xmath38 . in order to solve for @xmath16 , we use the generating function , defined as    @xmath39    with the inversion formula    @xmath40    in the above expression , the contour is taken as a circle of infinitesimal radius centered at the origin @xmath41 .",
    "the generating function itself has the perturbation theory expansion @xmath42 .",
    "naturally , the inversion formula in eq.[eq : eq7 ] also applies to each order in @xmath6 :    @xmath43    using the power - series expansion in eq.[eq : eq3 ] , the catastrophe frequency in eq.[eq : eq2 ] may be expanded in the form    @xmath44    in order to calculate the protofilament catastrophe using eq.[eq : eq9 ] , we first solve eq.4 - 5 by defining the laplace transforms @xmath45 .",
    "the general expressions for @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( relevant to eq.[eq : eq9 ] ) as well the relations between them are given in the appendix .",
    "we will first calculate the protofilament catastrophes in the steady state limit under different regimes , which are conveniently classified as below :    when the protofilament rescue rate @xmath48 , the system reaches a complete steady state , where all the probabilities @xmath49 become independent of time in the long - time limit , and so does the catastrophe . here , we study the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 separately ( a demarcation warranted by perturbation theory , but seemingly artificial , since numerical solution of the master equation shows that the catastrophe frequency varies continuously across @xmath52 , see fig.[fig : fig2 ] later ) .",
    "when @xmath53 , on the other hand , the @xmath29 state becomes absorbing and hence none of the probabilities @xmath54 has a non - zero steady state value .",
    "however , even in this case , the catastrophe frequency is found to have a well - defined non - zero steady state value , which is different from the previous case .",
    "these cases are treated in subsections a and b respectively .",
    "finally , it is seen that the special case @xmath55 can be solved exactly for both @xmath48 and @xmath53 , see subsection d.    in order to find the steady state value of @xmath56 , the steady state values of all dynamical quantities appearing in eq.9 are found in the @xmath57 limit .",
    "we denote the steady state values of @xmath16 and @xmath56 by the same symbols , but without the @xmath18-dependence . using laplace transforms ,",
    "these limits may be defined as @xmath58 .",
    "if the limit turns out to be zero , the steady state value is zero ( i.e. , the corresponding dynamical quantity vanishes as @xmath57 and a more careful treatment will be needed to understand the @xmath57 behavior , as is required when @xmath53 ) .    given that calculations involved are somewhat lengthy , we only give a summary of our final results in the main text , while the mathematical details are presented in the supplemental material to the paper @xcite .",
    "the steady state protofilament catastrophe frequency takes the form    @xmath61    interestingly , we note that the expression in eq.[eq : eq13 ] differs from the corresponding expression for the microtubule catastrophe frequency in the one - dimensional effective continuum fhl model , which ( in our notation ) is given by    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the spontaneous hydrolysis rate per unit length . a brief derivation of the above result , under perturbation theory",
    ", is given in the supplemental material @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , while the continuum model predicts that @xmath64 as @xmath65 , the discrete model predicts that @xmath10 vanishes in this limit as @xmath66 .",
    "both the continuum and discrete expressions diverge at @xmath52 , however , this divergence is not real . a scaling argument ( see later ) shows that , as we approach the point @xmath52 , the higher order terms in @xmath6 begin to be important , and are also possibly divergent as @xmath67 .",
    "if such terms have alternating signs , the complete function may well be convergent and well - behaved at the point @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , numerical solution confirm this argument .",
    "we next consider the case of small growth velocities .      in this case ,",
    "detailed calculations show that the steady state catastrophe frequency takes the form      unlike the previous case , here , the catastrophe frequency has a non - vanishing zeroth order term , which decreases linearly with @xmath4 and vanishes at @xmath52 . the first order term ,",
    "however , again diverges at @xmath52 ( which should be interpreted with the same reservations as previously ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath10 is dependent on the protofilament rescue frequency , and as @xmath70 , the following limiting value is reached :    @xmath71    as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , which is its maximum value ( see eq.[eq : eq2 ] , and also eq.[eq : eq23 ] , later ) .      here",
    ", we consider the situation where the protofilament rescue rate is strictly zero .",
    "this ` non - steady state ' situation is the case studied in many theoretical models , including @xcite .",
    "the case of zero rescue needs to be treated with caution , as , strictly speaking , the only steady state possible is @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "however , careful calculations using the perturbative approach shows that the catastrophe frequency does reach a steady state , and the expression turns out to be @xcite    @xmath79    note that eq.[eq : eq17 ] is different from the expression in eq.[eq : eq13 ] , and its asymptotic form is @xmath80 as @xmath65 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath52 is again an artifact of the perturbation theory .",
    "the general solution for @xmath51 turned out to require a lengthy calculation , and hence was not pursued ; rather , we found it instructive to look at the extreme case of vanishing growth rate , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath81 , if the initial condition is @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the condition of zero growth then guarantees that @xmath85 for @xmath86 at all times @xmath18 . we may further assume that the steady state @xmath10 is independent of the initial value @xmath22 ; therefore , it may be obtained by solving eq.[eq : eq1 ] exactly with a small value of @xmath22 ; here we chose @xmath87 .",
    "the exact time - dependent solutions for the relevant probabilities in this case are given as    @xmath88    which yields , using eq.[eq : eq2 ] ,    @xmath89    exactly .",
    "in fact , this technique may be used for the @xmath48 case also , at the point @xmath81 . in this case , we arrive at the following exact steady state expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with the same initial condition :    @xmath92    which then yield the exact result    @xmath93    thus , the extremal @xmath81 value for @xmath10 is the same for @xmath53 and @xmath48 , but their asymptotic behavior at large @xmath4 differ by a factor of 2 . the same result given by eq.[eq : eq23 ] can be obtained for @xmath94 etc , but the calculations become lengthier as @xmath22 increases .      finally , we consider the case where the @xmath95 term is absent from eq.[eq : eq1 ] ; this implies that there is no vectorial hydrolysis in the model , and no dissociation of t - mers from the protofilament prior to catastrophe .",
    "this case has been studied by several authors @xcite in recent times ( note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , vectorial hydrolysis is deemed absent , but t - mer dissociation is included ) .",
    "in this situation , it is possible to obtain exact solutions to eq.[eq : eq1 ] , and hence @xmath10 can be computed for arbitrary @xmath6 .",
    "as earlier , we consider the cases @xmath48 and @xmath53 separately .",
    "a steady state is possible in this case , as can be obviously verified by putting the time derivatives in eq.[eq : eq1 ] to zero .",

    "one can not fail to note the surprising similarity with the asymptotic decay of the expression in eq.[eq : eq13 ] ; the expressions become identical when @xmath95 is replaced with @xmath6 in eq.[eq : eq13 ] .      in this case , as @xmath57 , @xmath101 while all @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , we need to consider the time evolution of the probabilities explicitly . with initial conditions @xmath104 and",

    "although the steady state expressions for @xmath10 in eq.[eq : eq13 ] or eq.[eq : eq25 ] do not depend on @xmath5 , they are , nevertheless , different from the corresponding @xmath53 expressions in eq.[eq : eq17 ] and eq.[eq : eq27 ] . to our knowledge",
    ", this difference has not been noted earlier .",
    "the results from perturbation theory discussed so far are significant in another way ; scaling arguments show that the leading steady state term in the perturbation theory expansion of @xmath10 also gives the leading asymptotic behavior of @xmath10 in the limit @xmath30 .",

    "in the present paper , we have studied the stochastic model of gtp cap dynamics , introduced by flyvbjerg , holy and leibler ( fhl ) @xcite . both spontaneous and vectorial",
    "hydrolysis have been included in the model , partly because the effect of the latter in the associated dynamical equation is the same as that of a dissociation term for a filament - incorporated gtp - dimer .",
    "unlike the fhl study , we employ a discrete formalism here , which is more appropriate for individual protofilaments .",
    "we do not make use of an effective one - dimensional picture of a microtubule unlike many previous authors @xcite ; rather , we define events of catastrophe and rescue for each protofilament , which are then related to microtubule catastrophe via first passage concepts .",
    "the protofilament catastrophe and rescue events are defined analogous to the corresponding events in an entire microtubule filament ; catastrophe here refers to the loss of a gtp - dimer tip in the protofilament , wherea s rescue refers to the addition of a gtp - dimer to a gdp - tipped protofilament .",
    "we find that even at the level of a single protofilament ( i.e. , a one - dimensional filament ) , the predictions of the model , in general , differ from the predictions of the corresponding continuum model of fhl .",
    "we also considered both steady state ( protofilament rescue present ) and non - steady state ( protofilament rescue absent ) situations ; the distinction between these has never been clearly addressed in the literature ( for example , in the fhl model , the loss of gtp cap is an absorbing state which can not be rescued whereas in the models used in @xcite , a gtp - dimer may attach to a gdp - tipped filament with non - zero probability and ` rescue ' it ) .",
    "we show rigorously that while catastrophe frequency in the stochastic model is independent of the protofilament rescue rate , it depends , nevertheless , on whether steady state or non - steady state conditions are employed .    in spite of these differences ,",
    "we show that the asymptotic behavior of protofilament catastrophe in the limit of large values of protofilament growth rate @xmath4 is simply @xmath127 , where the proportionality constant depends on the specific conditions used .",
    "this remarkable universal property perhaps partly explains why predictions of many different models have been found to fit well with available experimental data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also compared predictions of our model with the exact results in antal et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as mean - field model of padinhateeri et al .",
    "@xcite , and found that the mathematical results of the models agree in the asymptotic regime discussed above , under appropriate conditions .",
    "a comparison of our estimate of @xmath6 , with those arrived at by other authors is illuminating .",
    "we observe that while there is a reasonable agreement between the values predicted by purely kinetic studies ( except ref .",
    "@xcite ) , they differ significantly from models where the energetics of the microtubule filament is explicitly included , which typically predict much higher values of @xmath6",
    ". however , since both types of models are seemingly able to demonstrate agreement with experiments , it would be interesting to know if the rate used in the kinetic models should be regarded as an effective parameter which hides some information about the energetics of binding between tubulin dimers , both within a protofilament and between protofilaments .",
    "we hope that our study will stimulate further investigations in this direction .",
    "our model also predicts that 2 - 3 protofilaments out of thirteen are required to lose the gtp cap to initialize a catastrophe event , based on an analysis of the ( microtubule ) age dependence of catastrophes , observed in experiments .",
    "it is likely that once such two shrinking protofilaments come side by side of a growing protofilament , this configuration can destabilize the middle one by the breaking lateral bonds , in this way making the lattice more unstable and finally forcing the entire microtubule into a shrinking state .",
    "this prediction agrees with the conclusions of other authors @xcite who have suggested , based on phenomenological arguments motivated by experimental data , that catastrophe is a multi - step process . in our view , the number of such steps precisely equals the number of protofilaments which need to become gdp - tipped in order for the microtubule catastrophe to be initiated .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this result in terms of the lateral bond energy o f protofilaments ; however , it must be borne in mind that the model does not require that these gdp - tipped protofilaments need to be adjacent to each other .",
    "clearly , this issue remains far from understood . also , the implications of the age dependence of microtubule catastrophes , both _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ is another aspect of the problem which seems worthy of further investigation .    to summarize , the present model which treats a microtubule as 13 independent protofilaments , is fairly successful in predicting the time evolution and steady states of microtubule catastrophe frequency , for a range of growth rates .",
    "the highlight of this model is that it enables calculation of microtubule dynamic parameters starting from the dynamics of individual protofilaments , which , being a strictly one - dimensional problem , is more amenable to analytical treatments .",
    "this is not to argue that inter - protofilament interactions , neglected in the present model but included in several other studies , are unimportant ; it is just that the limited experimental data available at the moment does not seem to be sufficient to make a clear - cut distinction between these two broad categories of models .",
    "the lateral bonds are also likely to play an important role in the process of rescue , which seems much less sensitive to tubulin concentration compared to catastrophe ( see , e.g , @xcite ) , and much less understood from a modeling point of view .    in _ in vivo _",
    "situations , microtubules grow in a confined environment and typically encounter obstacles to growth in the form of rigid or flexible barriers . in the context of chromosome capture and subsequent spindle formation during the mitotic phase , it is well - known that microtubules exert forces both when polymerizing and depolymerizing .",
    "the negative effects of polymerization force , when generated against a rigid barrier , on the growth velocity of microtubules was first shown experimentally by dogterom and yurke @xcite and subsequently studied theoretically by other authors(see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "experiments have also shown that the catastrophe frequency is enhanced by the proximity of the microtubule tip to a barrier , both _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite and _ in vivo _",
    "@xcite , which is consistent with a reduced binding rate in the presence of force ( see @xcite , two recent theoretical studies of h ow microtubule dynamic instability is affected by force and confinement ) .",
    "interestingly , the 13-protofilament model used by the authors of @xcite is similar to the model studied in the second part of this paper .",
    "it should , therefore , be possible to extend the present model in a straightforward manner to include force - dependence of @xmath4 , in a protofilament - specific manner @xcite",
