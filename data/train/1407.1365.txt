    "laminar flow is the case of a flow that persists in a stationary fashion at each point .",
    "such flow is either static or found in the case of uniformly driven boundary conditions or external forces .",
    "the well - definedness of the term is a bit in doubt in the case of time varying boundaries .",
    "if the boundaries move in a periodic fashion and the flow does as well , it might be considered to be laminar even though the flowlines are not time independent .",
    "an unambiguous notion of unsteady flow might be given by the notion of bifurcation as we see in the case of the van karman vortex street .",
    "these flows around obstacles give a set of counterrotating vortices that grow and advance behind the body .",
    "the reason we call this a bifurcation is that , in the eulerian point of view , the flow velocity at each point undergoes a simple period of evolution at each point .",
    "given the values of @xmath3 for a particular point @xmath4 , we can find the neighboring @xmath5 values from the function @xmath6 by integration .",
    "are not arbitrary but must satisfy the frobinius integration condition @xmath7 . ]",
    "the pressure can be found from the the equation of state after integrating the density @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "this particular case gives a foliation of solutions @xmath10 indexed by the one parameter set of value of @xmath5 at @xmath4 .",
    "the navier - stokes equations also require second derivative information in the velocity @xmath11 to relate this to the n - s equations requires us to give a time derivative of each one of these functions that preserves the foliation and advances through it at a rate indicated by the relative density @xmath12 at each point .",
    "let these solutions be indicated by @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a compact parameter .",
    "we can write the n - s equations , assuming that the fluid is incompressible enough during its motions that bulk viscous contributions are negligible , as @xmath16 our parameterized set of solutions then evolves along the parameter space by a function @xmath17 .",
    "we can rewrite the equations of motion in terms of the local functions @xmath18 @xmath19 in general , we would expect closure relations to be necessary for the evolution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 but , for such a simple flow , these are constrained uniquely by the values of @xmath5 and @xmath22 at each point .",
    "this then becomes an implicit equation for @xmath23 .    in terms of our statistical variables",
    ", we see that for each point @xmath24 , the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath22 and @xmath27 have only one solution for each choice of @xmath5 obtained at that point .",
    "this means that the probability function @xmath28 condenses to the form @xmath29 where the functions @xmath30 are assumed known .",
    "the one parameter set of solutions at each point will impose self consistency conditions on such functions since they are not independent of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have chosen not to utilize the pressure function as a fundamental variable and instead to keep track of the density @xmath22 with an implicit equation of state @xmath33 . in the case of a constant density fluid",
    "we can derive pressure from an elliptic constraint equation of the flow but , for our new statistical variables , some correlation data will almost certainly enter and this becomes intractable for our distribution function in the form @xmath34 .",
    "as the flow gets more complicated we can not assume that the single valued nature of the variables is preserved so that knowing @xmath35 is sufficient probability to determine the entire solution .",
    "in fact , we know from the case of the lorenz attractor that the distribution function may not even be quasicontinuous as this grows in complexity . however , we can be sure that , if we drive the flow uniformly with stationary boundary conditions that the flow will converge to a long time average distribution on some time scale even if it is turbulent .",
    "our `` solution '' in eqn .",
    "[ formal ] was rather formal and seems to buy us no new information .",
    "let us now use it as a template to describe more complicated flows .",
    "as in the case of nonlinear differential equations , it seems likely that the local flow data at each point undergo a set of bifurcations as the flow becomes more extreme .",
    "specifically , the laminar flow leads to oscillations so @xmath5 and @xmath22 at each point move in a bounded cycle so that the probability @xmath36 at each point gives an orbit in 4-d space .",
    "this orbit can become very convoluted and never self intersect .",
    "as long as the distribution @xmath37 is such that only one choice of values of @xmath22 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 can correspond to each @xmath5 , the distribution function in eqn .  [ dist ] decomposes and the evolution of the stable distribution(s ) is simple .    when this simple periodicity no longer holds , one can look for higher dimensional correlation functions like @xmath38 so that a particular choice of @xmath39 at any given point are not sufficient to determine all the required derivatives in the n - s equations uniquely .",
    "thus , instead of a closure scheme , we are confronted with a pde with boundary conditions where we seek a static solution to a distribution where the dimensionality of the solution may become dependent on the complexity of the flow .",
    "observations of turbulent flow give some qualitative observations on the size and strength of vortices so that knowing one component of the velocity at a point puts strong limits on the other directions of flow and its gradients .",
    "turbulence gives a range of vortex sizes and energies but the observation of scaling laws of kolmogorov and richardson @xcite suggests some ordering in the energy of vortices based on size . because of this and the above bifurcation arguments , we begin with the assumption that the time averaged filling of the local jet spaces for unsteady flows , even turbulent ones , is rather sparse . specifically , given a probability function @xmath36 , once @xmath5 and @xmath22 are specified there is only one local flow profile corresponding to it .",
    "this seems like a large assumption but in the case of the vortex street , it is clearly so",
    ".    consider such a density function found by a long time observation .",
    "not just any such function is meaningful .",
    "these are found by averaging over many global flows . as such",
    ", we expect some consistency constraint on such functions .",
    "when we start with @xmath40 at a particular point @xmath4 this should correspond to one global flow for a particular @xmath39 there .",
    "this means we should be able to extend our solution outwards from this point by looking for similar @xmath12 weights in the neighboring points . of course , if @xmath12 is constant in space this is not sufficiently restrictive .",
    "we know that linear shear flow between two parallel plates under high @xmath41 numbers is a solution of n - s but not a stable one .",
    "it is reasonable to expect physical solutions will involve @xmath12 functions of variability in all directions in the space @xmath42 .",
    "an immediate problem we face is that restricting @xmath36 to a constant value in a neighborhood of @xmath43 does not uniquely fix @xmath5 and @xmath22 in it .",
    "therefore , we will need a collection of such functions .",
    "a set that meets this need is the topic of the next section .",
    "our goal is to find one ( or at least a sparse set of ) solutions corresponding to the stationary driving boundary conditions for a flow . to this end",
    "we introduce a time dependence for @xmath12 as @xmath44 reminiscent of the ensemble approaches in statistical physics .",
    "however , we are not attempting to imply some sort of local , temporal or ensemble averaging of questionable meaning in this case . we know how n - s evolves the implied solutions and therefore how such a distribution should evolve . by using some sort of annealing procedure",
    "we hope to find stationary physical @xmath12 functions that give the distribution of the flows over long times .",
    "these distributions will degenerate to particular values at the boundaries or other locations where driving conditions are present .",
    "we have seen that there is reason to suspect that the statistical distributions from long time averages of a flow with stationary driving conditions will tend to be fairly sparse .",
    "however there is some problem with getting the relations between the spaces at neighboring points to relate to the n - s equations from a single correlated probability function @xmath36 .",
    "let us begin with the notion that the probability of a given @xmath45 at point @xmath46 tends to a distribution that we can use to bootstrap our way to correlated probabilities of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath22 components .",
    "the field gradients are to be determined by the self consistency condition that the probability functions evaluated at constant value on a neighborhood induce a region of a true solution in time evolution of the system regardless of the initial data .    to this end",
    "introduce the following probability functions at each point : @xmath49 to extract the local information about the solution with value @xmath50 at point with coordinates @xmath4 we evaluate the value of @xmath51 at @xmath52 and find the values of @xmath45 that force @xmath51 to be constant in the neighborhood of @xmath4 .",
    "the dimensionality of the argument implies that there is , generally , one such solution in this neighborhood so that we can expand @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function of a small @xmath55 direction vector defined by @xmath56 . to linear approximation , the constant value @xmath51-sheet is locally defined by @xmath57 so that @xmath58 and @xmath59    however , we need second order information to utilize the viscosity terms in the n - s equations .",
    "the conditions to second order can be found by realizing that @xmath60 can be expanded as @xmath61 requiring the probability function to be constant locally gives @xmath62 or @xmath63 choosing the branch of solutions connected to the above linear one we have @xmath64 from which we determine that @xmath65 and @xmath66    substitution in the n - s equations gives us equations for @xmath67 in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "this still leaves the missing parts @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath22 and @xmath71 .",
    "interestingly , the n - s equations are linear in the velocities in the viscous term but not in the advective term @xmath72 .",
    "we now note that we have a local second order representation for @xmath45 we can use @xmath73 and substitute this result to give @xmath74 . by iterating the above process",
    "we obtain equations for @xmath47 . similarly , @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 give the missing @xmath48 and @xmath22 information .",
    "the equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 arise in the same fashion .",
    "the conservation law specifies @xmath79 .",
    "these are all in terms of our probability functions , @xmath80 , and gradients of them .",
    "the above repeated iteration allows us to bootstrap our way to the second order derivatives of all the velocity functions @xmath81 and @xmath22 while allowing correlations among them .",
    "our goal is not now utilize these the accelerations @xmath82 from the n - s equations to specify the time derivatives of the probability functions as a closed system . to accomplish this for @xmath51",
    "we need to transfer the information from each solution patch and its evolution to obtain the time dependence of the probability function @xmath83 .",
    "the n - s solution tells us how @xmath5 is locally changing through @xmath84 . to map this to an action on our probability function",
    "we view this as a push - forwards of the distribution function @xmath85 at each point .",
    "since @xmath86 is a density the transformation @xmath87 is induced by the shift in the coordinates and a factor of the measure of the transformation .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation is @xmath88 where the location @xmath43 is fixed .",
    "the function @xmath89 is a function of second spatial derivatives of @xmath51 but now we interpret it as vector field in the local space labeled by @xmath45 so the derivatives wrt @xmath45 require no higher order derivatives of @xmath51 .",
    "this measure factor ensures that our normalization condition is preserved and @xmath90 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 is then given by the infinitesimal evolution of the distribution @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is given indirectly by the n - s equations through @xmath94 .",
    "we have taken some liberty with the single derivative `` dot '' symbol here not to imply @xmath51 is a function of one variable but to indicate that the function @xmath51 lives on the fixed coordinate space @xmath95 so none of the arguments evolve hence no chain rule factors arise .",
    "we can iteratively apply this argument to get equations for the time derivatives of each of the distribution functions to give a set of four coupled partial differential equations . for the case of",
    "@xmath96 we have @xmath97 where the jacobian of the transformation is @xmath98 is the determinant of a 2x2 matrix in @xmath24 and @xmath99 components .",
    "the results for @xmath100 and @xmath101 are similar , though of increasing complexity due to the iterations .",
    "the calculational flow for these repeated steps can be summarized in fig .",
    "[ flow ]     yields a unique corresponding local velocity field about @xmath43 that is evolved by n - s then mapped to back to a flow on the local probability space.,width=384 ]    the physical solution is the case where the time derivatives vanish as we have argued that this is the limiting time average of the stationarily driven flow .",
    "certainly such a limit exists .",
    "it is not clear that it is unique or that our solution could not have combined multiple distinct results . in nonlinear dynamics of odes",
    "one can have multiple separate attractors .",
    "certainly we can have distinct unstable flows as in the laminar case . in the case of turbulence or randomly perturbed situations , it is unknown if such a situation can exist .",
    "for now we assume that our flows have no such complications .    a natural approach to solving such",
    "a system is to begin with some sufficiently nontrivial initial data so that unique local solution patches can be inferred from our constant probability conditions then to `` anneal '' the distributions by removing probability from the rapidly changing parts of each probability function at each @xmath43 and renormalizing so that the norm of each is preserved .",
    "the motivations for this approach to hydrodynamic flow came from investigations into thermal systems , specifically , the thermal quantum state .",
    "although physicists have grown more comfortable with a deterministic many body wavefunction as the universal descriptor for all time in nature , the extension of this to thermodynamics has been especially troublesome .",
    "the main problems with quantum mechanics as a deterministic system stem from discrete measurement actions .",
    "this is presumed to be solved by decoherence by many , often by updating the very definition of decoherence to meet new challenges and problems . in the case of quantum statistical mechanics ,",
    "ensembles are used rather formally@xcite .",
    "the boltzmann counting is used among eigenstates near a given energy to give density of states function from which all thermodynamic properties are derived @xcite .",
    "this is problematic in the case of discrete states where such a quasicontinuous averaging is ambiguous but more so in the nonequilibrium case .",
    "one can make even more severe objections to the fact that one should be able to have constant energy states that are made from states nowhere near the same eigenstate energies . in the case of classical kinetics ,",
    "the constant energy surface constrains the gas in phase space but such a space in the quantum hilbert space is far larger than that limited by the quantum ensemble .    to overcome this problem and find a description that is more compatible with the actual many body wavefunction of a particular system that is overwhelmingly likely to give statistical behavior , in the spirit of classical kinetics , we can attempt a time averaged state in many body space @xmath102 we can give two functions @xmath103)$ ] and @xmath104,\\im[\\psi(\\tilde{x})])$ ] .",
    "equivalently , one could use the many body density @xmath105 and current @xmath106 with the proviso that the current be finite and irrotational except at @xmath107 dimensional subspaces where the density vanishes .",
    "the problem of deriving quantum kinetics from first principles persists despite the frequent usefulness of the kubo formula .",
    "it is clear that one must have a spread in eigenstate energies to get any fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "if one needs a particular distribution of energies then the property of self equilibration of a system , as we generally see in nature , would not be present .",
    "a local statistical distribution made from the long time averages might provide some universality for a broad class of physical initial data .    in a more classical direction , hydrodynamics of classical gases",
    "can be derived to lowest order from the maxwell - boltzmann equations themselves @xcite .",
    "however , attempts at higher order corrections typically lead to divergences .",
    "the problem seems likely to be in the local averaging we use to define our thermodynamic variables .",
    "the density and velocity fields require some space and/or time averaging to get smoothed results . when mean - free - path scale effects become important such averaging is no longer valid .",
    "fluctuations on the small scale are suspected to be important @xcite and this is when it is said that hydro `` breaks . ''",
    "a possible approach that does not rely on ensembles or such regional averaging is to give nonlocal variables that measure , at each instance , the weighted distribution of particle neighbor location about every point ( independent of wether there is a particle at the point or not ) . by extending to many particle separations",
    ", one can get a rather smooth distribution of quasilocal information that is associated with that point . by finding a self consistency condition for",
    "such measures one might evolve statistical measure of such distributions using annealing methods to reach a time independent result corresponding to the long time average of the classical kinetic system .",
    "the use of ensembles in physics have many conceptual difficulties and are introduced `` formally '' so often that these problems are now rarely known well even to practitioners .",
    "this collection of probability functions is introduced in such a way as to avoid these .",
    "the only physical meaningful solutions are the final time independent solutions with the time dependent ones only transitional tools to arrive at them .",
    "the boundary conditions are specified on the distribution function by no - slip conditions so that the distribution degenerates to a single value of @xmath5 there .",
    "the pressure is not necessarily constant but the perpendicular acceleration of @xmath5 should remain zero which induces an indirect constraint on the density there . even if this method should solve many problems of turbulent flow they still have obvious limitations .",
    "we often care about transitions to turbulence and cases where the external forces and boundaries are not constant .",
    "one might be tempted to utilize these probability functions in such cases but care here is essential .",
    "the meaning of such a distribution is not clear even if it should produce a set of desired boundary stresses and internal dynamics and energy distribution though some relaxation .",
    "the use of statistical methods in physics has been a powerful tool since maxwell introduced them for the theory of gases . in hydrodynamics",
    ", flows can have energy distributed on so many scales that numerical simulations rapidly run into speed and data storage limits .",
    "an analytic approach to turbulence based on statistical data has evident advantages even if it is only a stepping stone to more condensed numerical methods . in the case here we have a reasonably compact set of functions with no arbitrary freedom in the evolution equations .",
    "the biggest assumption is in the sparseness of the distribution so we can use local statistical data to match with a local hydrodynamic patch of data to evolve and induce a closure in the evolution of the distribution functions themselves .",
    "it is quite possible that this condition fails at some level of turbulence .",
