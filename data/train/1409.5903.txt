    "this low quality is not caused by an unsuitable model , but rather by calibration problems due to numerous chip - gaps and dead pixels ( see the _ rgs _ user manual ) in the _ rgs_.    the fit residuals exhibit a possible absorption feature at 0.57  kev .",
    "therefore , we included _",
    "gabs _ as further component in the fit model to account for this feature .",
    "the _ gabs _ model yields line energy , optical depth and sigma of the line . however , the equivalent width of a line is a more reliable parameter , in particular on estimating the line significance . since _",

    "the output equivalent widths are gaussian distributed , delivering the corresponding confidence interval .    indeed , the fit improves ( @xmath157 ) , yielding an equivalent width of @xmath158 ( 90% confidence ) for the previously unknown absorption feature .",
    "since the emission of vela appears extended , we furthermore co - added only those four observations , where it was possible to measure the intensity profile along the _ rgs _ dispersion axes .",
    "the resulting _ rgs _ spectra sums up to a total net exposure time of 413  ks ( both _ rgs _ ) with 349,000 and 376,000 source photons , respectively .    analysing the data in exactly the same manner yields @xmath159 ( again @xmath160 , even if the absorption feature is included in the fit model ) .",
    "although the second spectra include much less photons compared to the previous methods , the line appears to be more significant ( 2.8@xmath26 versus 5.2@xmath26 ) .",
    "this effect can be explained by assuming a contribution from an extended emission region , such as a hot disk , around the vela pulsar . in the first methods",
    ", these parts of the line would smear out and thus would not contribute to the spectrum .",
    "this implies that the line significance changes by accounting for possible contributions from an extended emission region .",
    "according to the _ rgs _ manual , the size of the emission region must be of the order of tens of arcsec or even some arcmin , i.e.  @xmath161 ( if scaled to vela s distance ) to cause such effects in the _ rgs _ spectra .",
    "therefore , we consider the jet and/or the pwn as source of the absorption feature from the extended emission and an overabundance of material ( related to the ism ) from the point source , that is a strong evidence for the presence of a disk around vela .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the equivalent width by fitting the _ rgs _ data using an alternative model ( _ tbabs _ ) for the ism .",
    "again , the line appears stronger , if the emission of an extended region is taken into account .",
    "our results of the line parameters are shown in , the spectra are shown in .",
    "the @xmath162 triplet of ovii contains the resonance line ( all line energies at rest ) at 573.95  ev , the intercombination line at 568.63  ev and the forbidden line at 560.99  ev ( @xcite and @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "the measured line energies ( ) are consistent with the line energy of the intercombination line , but not with the other line energies .",
    "however , the intercombination line should not appear in absorption . this ( still unsolved ) enigma",
    "does also appear in the case of the isolated x - ray pulsar rxj0720.4@xmath43125 @xcite , whereas the absorption feature found in the _ rgs _ spectra of rxj1605.3 + 3249 is consistent with the resonance line @xcite .",
    "we stress , however , that the errors of the line energies are relatively large in spectra fitting with @xmath160 and that the spectral resolution of _ rgs _ amounts 12  ev at 0.5  kev .",
    "thus , an exact line identification requires further observations .    according to the @xmath163 values @xcite of @xmath164 and an oxygen / hydrogen ratio of @xmath165 @xcite in the solar vicinity , the expected column density of ovii ( ism only , all oxygen ionized to ovii ) is @xmath166 in the line of sight .",
    "note that in order to provide significant amount of ovii ions an unusual hot component of the ism of temperature of 1.2mk must present in the direction of vela pulsar . on the other hand , the equivalent widths of the absorption feature from both methods ( ) yield @xcite @xmath167 ( left column in ) and @xmath168 ( right column in ) , respectively .",
    "hence , even if all oxygen is ionized to ovii ( that is not possible , since then already there should be oviii and some ovi is still left in case of equilibrium ) and the velocity dispersion of the particles is above 420  km / s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  2 therein )",
    ", the equivalent widths are hard to reconcile with being caused by the contributions from the ism only .",
    "thus , the co - added _ rgs _ spectra of vela were fitted with two different models for the ism and taking the extended emission of vela into account .",
    "the resulting _ rgs _ spectra , shown in figure  [ rgs ] show strong evidence for the presence of a narrow absorption feature at 0.57  kev .",
    "this feature can be interpreted as the @xmath162 line of he - like oxygen ( ovii ) and thus points to a significant over - abundance of these ions in the line of sight . by measuring the line strength",
    ", the required amounts of material would exceed these as expected from the ism .",
    "therefore , the narrow absorption feature at 0.57  kev originate partly from a putative disk around the vela pulsar and partly from the pwn , as shown by our methods of data analysis .",
    "the evolution of a thin disk , such as the one we suggest to exist around the vela pulsar , is described by a diffusion equation for the surface mass density , @xmath169 ( see eqn . in appendix ) .",

    "we see that after about 10 viscous time - scales the initial conditions are forgotten and the numerical solution matches the analytical solution . in panel",

    "we show the evolution of the viscous torque at the inner boundary .",
    "we emphasize that no fitting algorithm is applied in the figures apart from employing the same amount of initial mass and angular momentum in numerical and analytical solutions .      wherever the magnetic field of the star threads the disk it is twisted azimuthally due to the differential rotation between the magnetosphere and the disk .",

    "our modeling of the larger portion of the spectrum including the optical and uv bands with the quiescent disk model of ss77 suggests that vela and its debris disk form a system in a strong propeller stage .",
    "the inner radius of the disk is found to be inside the light cylinder and would then be interacting with the magnetosphere .",
    "the presence of disk torques assisting the magnetic dipole radiation torques partly explains the braking index being substantially less than 3 @xcite , and may also address the evolution in the @xmath6 diagram @xcite .",

    "we stress that the quiescent disk solution of ss77 and @xcite in which the mass flux within the disk is halted because of the large propeller torques acted at the inner rim of the disk is not to be confused with the notion of `` passive disks '' in which the mass flux is reduced due to insufficient ionization such that magnetorotational instability @xcite can not operate and sustain turbulence . furthermore , we would like to emphasize that the quiescent disk picture of propelled disks that we present in this work is well different from what had been employed in the fallback disk literature up to now ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the large mass influx leads to large viscous dissipation @xcite with optically bright disks even in the propeller stage .",
    "our fitting of the spectrum of vela favours a disk flow with closer resemblance to the quiescent disk solutions of ss77 and @xcite where the stopping of the material at the inner boundary halts the mass inflow totally .",
    "yet we have also seen that the boundary layer luminosity and the viscous luminosity of the keplerian disk are very small compared to the spin - down luminosity .",
    "this indicates that the torque required to explain the viscous dissipation in the disk is much smaller than the torque required to explain the inner radius via eq . and the braking index via eq .  .",
    "to rescue the fallback disk model one might argue that the energy transferred by the magnetosphere of the star is mostly taken by the kinetic energy of the outflow .",
    "the presence of an an outflow would imply the presence of same amount of inflowing matter and associated dissipation in the disk which would overwhelm the observed fluxes . if , however , the disk is advection dominated @xcite the luminosity of the disk would be substantially lowered .",

    "fallback disks are not tidally torqued as disks in binary systems and can expand freely either to conserve its total angular momentum when matter is being lost from its inner boundary or to take up the extra angular momentum added to the disk by the magnetosphere of the neutron star . in this section",

    "note that equation  ( [ diff1 ] ) is symmetric under translations in time and we have exploited this to write the original solutions shifted as @xmath278 .    in the non - dimensionalization process",
    "we have employed four quantities , @xmath180 , @xmath174 , @xmath182 and @xmath181 , related by two equations @xmath279 and @xmath173 .",
    "this means we are free to attribute any value for two of the variables e.g.  @xmath180 and @xmath174 .",

    "another important property is the inverse dependence of @xmath182 on the initial mass of the disk @xmath311 ; a disk with a larger mass with the same average specific angular momentum will evolve more rapidly because , in order to have the same specific angular momentum , more mass of the disk should be placed at smaller orbits .",

    "<S> our results suggest that the pulsar mechanism can work simultaneously with the propeller processes and that the debris disks can survive the radiation pressure for at least @xmath1 years . </S>",
    "<S> as vela is a relatively close object , and a prototypical pulsar , the presence of a disk , if confirmed , may indicate the ubiquity of debris disks around young neutron stars . </S>"
