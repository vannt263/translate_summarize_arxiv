    "during the early days of the trace formula nobody really believed that it could be used to predict individual eigenvalues , at least not in the strict semiclassical limit .",
    "there are mainly two ( related ) sources of errors .",
    "first , the semiclassical energy domain green function is obtained by laplace transforming the van - vleck propagator @xcite .",
    "however , quantum evolution follows classical evolution only for a limited time , a time that seems to be longer than first expected @xcite , but still limited .",
    "computing the laplace transform ( with time going from zero to infinity ) of such an object is of course adventurous .",
    "secondly , the trace formula is obtained by taking the trace of this energy domain green function by stationary phase technique .",
    "this is the procedure that selects out the periodic orbits . whether or not this stationary phase approximation is justified for a particular cycle depends on @xmath4 , for sufficiently small @xmath4 it is always justified .",
    "so , the the performance of the trace formula depends on the set of cycles that are required to resolve a particular state , and the accuracy of their semiclassical weights .",
    "consequently , the _ semiclassical error _ depends on the context , the method by which the eigenvalues are extracted . in the berry - keating method@xcite it depends only on the error of the amplitudes of periodic orbits up to certain length , whereas in complex methods , based on _ cycle expansions _",
    "@xcite , the error of the long cycles effects the convergence of the cycle expansion and the final position of the eigenvalue .",
    "an alternative approach is based on the boundary integral method and the semiclassical limit of the characteristic determinant@xcite .",
    "bogomolny s transfer matrix method is closely related to this approach@xcite .    however , it turned out from , numerical computations that the gutzwiller - voros zeta function does exhibit complex zeroes quite close to the ( real ) quantum eigenvalues , at least in the lower part of the spectrum@xcite . the berrry - keating formula performed even better@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on a functional equation for the ( exact ) spectral determinant . by insisting on using the functional equation in the semiclassical limit , one actually put in information into the computation : _ the spectrum is real_.",
    "the result may be a quite respective number of eigenvalues , only a few percent wrong .",
    "none of these computations indicated what will happen in the strict semiclassical limit .",
    "common estimates have suggested that the semiclassical errors , measured relative the mean level spacing , should tend to a constant as @xmath5 , for system in two degrees of freedom .",
    "for a nice review , see ref @xcite .",
    "two common features of chaotic systems may cause problems to the stationary phase approximation .",
    "the first is intermittency . from a periodic pont of view ,",
    "it means that long orbits does not need to be very unstable , or more precisely , periodic orbit stabilities can not be exponentially bounded with their length .",
    "if a long cycle is `` relatively stable '' it means that the corresponding saddle point is not isolated enough from its surroundings .",
    "secondly , the complex topology of generic systems make bifurcations abundant ( with respect to variation of some parameter ) .",
    "so , for a generic systems there are `` almost existing '' and `` almost forbidden '' orbits all over phase space . for billiards",
    "the trace integral scans a function sprinkled with discontinuities .",
    "nearly pruned orbits live near such discontinuities and the saddle point integrals has to be provided with cutoffs which leads to diffraction effects .",
    "even axiom - a systems such as the baker map @xcite suffers from diffraction effects but to a less extent . for smooth potentials one has to face stabilization of cycles close to bifurcation .",
    "sufficiently pruned orbits can be included as ghost orbits @xcite but close to bifurcations uniform approximations has to be invoked@xcite .",
    "there are two pioneering studies indicating that many of the terms included in the berry - keating sum are way off , the stationary phase approximation behind them is simply not justified .",
    "tanner @xcite studied the dynamics close to the bouncing ball orbit in the stadium billiard , and primack et.al .",
    "@xcite studied the sinai billiard and orbits scattering in very forward direction or sneaking very close to the disk .",
    "both cases deals with systems with neutral orbits and as such intermittent .",
    "the paper @xcite by primack et.al . is the main inspiration for the present study . by estimating the size of this _ penumbra _ and its scaling in energy",
    ", they concluded that _",
    "\" the semiclassical approximation fails for the majority of the relevant po s _ ( periodic orbits ) _ in the semiclassical limit \" .",
    "_ it thus seems likely that the berry - keating approach will eventually cease to produce individual eigenvalues .",
    "such a conclusion is by no means obvious .",
    "simple conclusions can ( maybe ) be drawn if the system is uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "but cycles contribute with very different weights in intermittent systems , such as the sinai billiard . if a minority of non diffractive cycles carried a large part of the semiclassical weight one could perhaps argue that the trace formula could be saved .",
    "but unfortunately the situations is the opposite .",
    "the cycles being most prone to penumbra diffraction have large semiclassical weights .",
    "the goal of this paper is to make this reasoning more precise .    in a latter study primack et.al .",
    "@xcite seems to tone down the importance of penumbra diffraction .",
    "they suggest that the semiclassical error in the semiclassical limit is of the order of the mean level spacing , or at most diverges logarithmically .",
    "it could thus be possible to resolve individual states even in the strict semiclassical limit .",
    "the study is mainly numerical , it is an ambiguous attempt to extrapolate from finite sets of quantum states and periodic orbits into the semiclassical limit .",
    "our present study will not support their claims .",
    "we will indeed find that the error will irrevocably increase beyond the mean level spacing .",
    "it is evident that a numerical study of the semiclassical error with periodic orbits is , least to say , difficult",
    ". a central tool in our approach will be asymptotic theory for the sets of periodic orbits based on an idea of baladi eckmann and ruelle @xcite .",
    "what we do is a model study of an intermittent system in two degrees of freedom .",
    "one should of course be cautious when trying to generalize the result to other system , especially to hyperbolic ones .",
    "the trace formula is indeed exact for some hyperbolic system , such as the cat map @xcite and geodesic flow on surfaces of constant negative curvature @xcite .",
    "the trace formula will probably perform much better in the hyperbolic case than in the intermittent .",
    "the disposition of the article is very much like a cooking recipe . in section [ s : ingred ]",
    "we present all the ingredients , such as the semiclassical zeta function , the berry - keating formula , penumbra diffraction , some classical periodic orbit theory and the ber approximation . in sec .",
    "[ s : prep ] we do the actual cooking .",
    "we consider the shift of a zero of the berry - keating formula if a perturbation , due to an error , is added .",
    "this simple exercise gives us the semiclassical error in terms of finite sums over pseudo orbits .",
    "we then relate these pseudo orbit sums to various zeta functions .",
    "these zeta functions are then calculated in the asymptotic theory which we call the ber approximation . in section [",

    "note that the size of the amplitudes is @xmath26 to leading order , and thus decays fast with @xmath27 .",
    "the zeta function is not seriously affected if one restricts the @xmath27 s to @xmath28 .",
    "this amounts to retain only the factor @xmath29 in ( [ eqn : zgv ] ) .",
    "the resulting type of zeta function is often referred to as a _ dynamical zeta function_.      the spectral determinant for a billiard obeys the functional equation @xmath30 the semiclassical analogue to the spectral determinant is @xmath31 the idea of berry and keating @xcite was to postulate that this semiclassical determinant also satisfies the functional equation ( [ eqn : funceq ] ) .",

    ".      another central object in our investigation will be the ( weighted ) evolution operator@xcite , whose action on a phase space distribution function @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 the phase space point @xmath40 is taken by the flow to @xmath41 during time @xmath42 .",

    "precisely as the semiclassical zeta function , the classical zeta function @xmath53 can be subject to a cycle expansion @xmath59 we will eventually use the weight @xmath60 to account for diffraction but for the time being it is just an arbitrary weight .",
    "we note that the identity in sec [ s : traces ] , holds also after smearing , @xmath61 where @xmath62 are gaussians of standard deviation @xmath63",
    ". we will be interested in very gross features of periodic sums .",

    "see eg @xcite .",
    "it was put into the context of ruelle resonances by baladi , eckmann and ruelle in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the formalism was generalized to include zeta functions with general thermodynamic weights , and the evaluation of chaotic averages .",

    "the approximate zeta function is then given in terms of the laplace transform of this function @xmath71      a convenient starting point for deriving the semiclassical trace formula for billiards , and to study its limitations , is the boundary integral method @xcite .",

    "the interesting thing is that the exact result is suppressed as compared to the semiclassical within a distance @xmath95 , a destructive interference between the rays starts already in the lit region and continues into the classical shadow .",
    "this twilight zone was called penumbra in @xcite . in appendix",

    "we therefore feel confident that the approach works even if more rigorous results are called for .",
    "we introduced some extra approximations , valid in the small @xmath2 limit , but our experience is that they work excellent even for rather large @xmath2 .",
    "one could again raise objection that the diffractive weight is discontinuous and that this could cause problems for averages to settle down .",
