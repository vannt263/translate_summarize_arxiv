    "we are concerned with the acoustic scattering problem @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is an incident field satisfying @xmath8 in @xmath2 . for simplicity , we take incident plane waves @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the unit sphere .",
    "the scattered field @xmath12 satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition : @xmath13    the scattering problem ( [ acimpoenetrable-2]-[radiationc-2 ] ) is well posed , see @xcite . applying green s formula to @xmath12 , we can show that the scattered field @xmath14 has the following asymptotic expansion : @xmath15 where the function @xmath16 for @xmath17 is the corresponding far - field pattern .",
    "our interest in this work is related to the classical inverse scattering problem which consists of reconstructing @xmath18 from the far - field data @xmath16 for some @xmath17 .",
    "this type of problem is well studied and there are several algorithms to solve it in the case when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are taken in the whole @xmath21 , see @xcite .",
    "it is also known that this problem is very unstable .",
    "precisely , the modulus of continuity is in general of logarithmic type , see @xcite .",
    "recently , based on a new type of experiments , a different approach was proposed , see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is divided into two steps . in the first one , we deform the acoustic medium by small inclusions located in the region containing the support of @xmath3 , and",
    "measure the far - fields generated by these deformations . from these far - fields",
    ", we can extract the total fields due to the medium @xmath1 in the interior of the support of @xmath3 . in the second step ,",
    "we reconstruct @xmath22 from these interior values of the total fields .",
    "recently , there was an increase of interest in reconstructing media from internal measurements .",
    "this is also related to the hybrid methods introduced in the medical imaging community , see @xcite for different setups and models .",
    "in contrast to the instability of the classical inverse scattering problem , the reconstruction from internal measurements is stable , see @xcite . however , the disadvantage with internal fields , i.e. internal values of the total fields , is the existence of their zeros which need to be properly dealt with to stabilize any algorithm . to overcome this short coming ,",
    "one can think of using measurements related to multiple frequencies @xmath23 , see @xcite .",
    "our objective in this paper is to propose an alternative to overcome the last disadvantage . for this",
    ", we propose to deform the medium using multiple ( precisely double ) and close inclusions instead of just single inclusions .",
    "then , measuring the generated far - fields by these multiple inclusions , we can extract , not only the internal total fields , but also the internal values of the green s function related to the non deformed medium @xmath1 .",
    "this is possible because by deforming the medium with multiple and close inclusions we generate scattered fields due to the multiple scattering between these inclusions .",
    "precisely , the far - fields we measure encode at least the second order term in the foldy - lax approximation and not only the first order ( or the born approximation ) as it is done when deforming with single or multiple but well separated inclusions .",
    "finally , we extract the values @xmath22 , @xmath24 in @xmath4 , from the singularities of this green s function .",
    "hence , we avoid the problems coming from the zeros of the internal total fields .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstruction is related to the minimum distance @xmath25 between the pairs of inclusions , in addition to the radius of the perturbations @xmath26 . in practice ,",
    "the perturbations are created using focusing waves , see @xcite for instance , hence we are limited by the resolution of the used waves ( acoustic waves for instance ) .",
    "in other words , the small perturbations can not be very close . in our analysis ,",
    "the ratio @xmath27 is of the form @xmath28 , with a parameter @xmath29 $ ] , and it can be chosen small by taking @xmath30 near @xmath31 . this allows to have the minimum distance between the inclusions quite large compared to their sizes .",
    "since the accuracy of the reconstruction , see theorem [ main - results ] , is of the order @xmath32 , with @xmath30 in @xmath33 $ ] with some @xmath34 , then one should find a reasonable balance between the limited resolution of the focusing waves , to be used to perturb the medium , and the desired accuracy of the reconstruction .",
    "more details related to this issue are provided in remark [ remark ] .",
    "we complete this section by describing the kind of deformations and the corresponding far - field measurements we use and then we state the derived formulas to extract the values of the index of refraction @xmath1 . in section @xmath35 , we justify these formulas with the emphasize on the explicit dependence of the error terms on the parameters modeling the small perturbations ( i.e. the maximum radii , the minimum distance between them and the scaled surface impedances ) . in section @xmath36 , we discuss the stability issue by providing the corresponding formulas when the measured data are contaminated with additive noises and when the small perturbations are shifted from their exact locations ( as moving from step @xmath35 to step @xmath36 in collecting the data , see section @xmath37 ) .",
    "we provide the regimes under which the derived formulas are still valid .      we give the details of this approach by using inclusions of the form of obstacles of impedance type .",
    "let @xmath38 be the ball with the center at the origin and radius @xmath39 .",
    "we set @xmath40 to be the small bodies characterized by the parameter @xmath41 and the locations @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "the price to pay is that we will have less accuracy in the reconstruction , see the formula ( [ formulas - for - n ] ) for instance .",
    "hence , one needs to find a compromise between the desired accuracy of the reconstruction and the permissible closeness of the small perturbations created by focusing waves .",

    "the importance of the parameter @xmath30 , describing the closeness of the small inclusions , appears in the last step ( i.e. the point 3 . in theorem [ main - results ] ) to compute the values of @xmath1 using the singularity analysis of .",
    "indeed , in ( [ green - function-2 ] ) , we can even take @xmath164 with @xmath165 . if we need to choose @xmath30 very small ( for practical or experimental reasons ) , then we can also use other methods to compute @xmath22 from @xmath166 .",

    "4 .   in this work ,",
    "we use localized perturbations modeled by small inclusions with impedance boundary conditions .",
    "however , the natural localized perturbations should occur on the coefficients of the model @xcite , i.e. the index of refraction @xmath1 in our model . in this respect , using surface impedance type inclusions might be more attractive in the academic level than in practice unless we accept and use the following argument . in case where",
    "there is a large contrast between the medium and the background , and according to the leontovich approximation , the contrast can be replaced by the surface impedance boundary condition .",

    "this means that we take @xmath175 in the asymptotic expansion ( [ x oustdie1 d_m farmain-2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "hence @xmath178 using the backscattered data @xmath179 and @xmath180 , and since @xmath181 is known , from ( [ m-1 ] ) we derive the formula @xmath182=-(v^t(z^l_m , \\theta_j))^2+\\ ; o\\left (   a\\right).\\ ] ] hence we can construct either @xmath183 or @xmath184 since the complex argument will be computed to an additive @xmath185 period . from ( [ m-1 ] ) , we see that we can compute @xmath186 , @xmath187 , with same additive period",
