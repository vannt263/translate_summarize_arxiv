    "the taub - nut instanton is the complete riemannian ricci - flat 4-manifold with the metric  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a free parameter which sets the scale .",
    "the taub - nut instanton is topologically @xmath5 with the surfaces of constant @xmath6 being the squashed three - spheres .",
    "although complete , the metric ( [ inst ] ) is not asymptotically euclidean because the @xmath7 fibers approach a constant circumference at infinity ( rather than growing like @xmath6 ) .",
    "this kind of asymptotic behavior is called asymptotically locally flat .    by adding the trivial term @xmath8 one obtains from ( [ inst ] ) the regular static solution of the five dimensional vacuum einstein equations @xmath9 this metric has been used in the past to obtain the four - dimensional magnetic monopole via a kaluza - klein reduction along the coordinate @xmath10 @xcite and since then it is usually called the kaluza - klein ( kk ) monopole . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the role of the kk monopole in the dynamics of non - asymptotically flat initial data , and in particular its nonlinear stability , has not been studied , probably because this problem appeared to require an analysis of the full five dimensional einstein equations which is beyond currently available numerical tools , let alone the analytic ones .",
    "this situation has changed recently with the introduction of a new cohomogeneity - two symmetry reduction of the five dimensional vacuum einstein equations ( referred to below as the bcs ansatz @xcite ) which provided a framework for investigating the dynamics in a simple @xmath11 dimensional setting .",
    "since the kk monopole falls within the bcs ansatz , the question of its nonlinear stability now becomes tractable and is the subject  of  this  paper .",
    "the kk monopole plays an important role in m / string theory .",
    "for example , its metric product with six flat euclidean dimensions gives a ricci - flat eleven dimensional lorentzian metric , which when reduced to ten spacetime dimensions may be interpreted as a d6-brane solution of type iia string theory  @xcite .",
    "as such , it is an example of what is called a supersymmetric or bps solution .",
    "bps solutions of supergravity theories are widely believed by many string theorists to be absolutely stable , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "however until now , this belief has never been tested in a fully non - linear setting .",
    "as we shall see , our results show that the classical stablity is not absolute since for sufficiently large perturbations a gravitational collapse to a black hole is possible .",
    "the implications of our results for bps states will be discussed briefly in the conclusions .",
    "the bcs ansatz has the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast to spherical symmetry , this ansatz possesses a dynamical degree of freedom , the field @xmath15 , which measures the deformation of sphericity of the angular part of the metric . substituting the metric ( [ bcs ] ) into the vacuum einstein equations one gets the following system of equations    @xmath18",
    "@xmath19    where primes and dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively . the initial value problem for this system was investigated in @xcite in the case of asymptotically flat initial data .",
    "here we consider asymptotically locally flat solutions .",
    "the kk monopole ( [ tn ] ) expressed in terms of the ansatz ( [ bcs ] ) takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 note that scaling invariance excludes the existence of nontrivial solutions which are everywhere regular _ and _ asymptotically flat .",
    "the kk monopole is the unique nontrivial regular static solution of the system ( 4 ) . to see this note that static solutions which are analytic at the origin form a one - parameter family with the following asymptotic behavior for @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the shooting parameter .",
    "since the system ( 4 ) is scale invariant , it follows from the uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations that , up to scaling , there is only one static solution which is analytic at the origin .",
    "it is easy to verify that the solution ( [ tn_bcs ] ) satisfies the regularity conditions ( [ bc ] ) with @xmath25 . for convenience , hereafter we choose units in which @xmath26 .",
    "before discussing numerical results , we first demonstrate that the kk monopole is linearly stable within our ansatz . to this end , following the standard procedure we seek solutions of the system ( 4 ) in the form @xmath27 where @xmath6 is a function of @xmath17 determined implicitly by ( [ rho ] ) . substituting the expansion ( [ pert ] ) into the system ( 4 ) , linearizing and separating the time dependence @xmath28 , after a straightforward but tedious calculation we get the eigenvalue equation for the spectrum of small perturbations around the kk monopole @xmath29",
    "although this equation can not be solved analytically in general , there is an explicit solution for @xmath30 @xmath31 this is the zero mode corresponding to the scaling freedom - it can be obtained by the action of the scaling generator @xmath32 on @xmath33 .",
    "the zero mode ( [ zeromode ] ) has no zeros which implies by the standard sturm - liouville theory that the operator @xmath34 has no negative eigenvalues .",
    "thus , the kk monopole is linearly stable within our ansatz .",
    "note that the zero mode is not a genuine eigenfunction because it is not square integrable .",
    "more precisely , on the hilbert space @xmath35 the self - adjoint operator @xmath34 has the purely continuous spectrum @xmath36 .",
    "nota bene , the taub - nut instanton ( [ inst ] ) is known to be linearly stable against transverse traceless perturbations .",
    "this follows from the work of hawking and pope  @xcite , who showed , using two linearly independent covariantly constant spinors which the taub - nut metric admits , that the spectrum of the lichnerowicz operator , which governs the linearized transverse traceless perturbations , is the same ( apart from zero modes ) as for the scalar laplacian , and therefore non - negative .",
    "using a fourth - order accurate finite difference code we have solved the system ( 4 ) numerically for several families of regular initial data which represent various perturbations of the kk monopole .",
    "the overall picture does not depend on the specific choice of a family .",
    "the results shown below were produced for initial data of the form ( using the momentum variable @xmath37 ) @xmath38 where the amplitude @xmath39 was varied and the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 were kept fixed . note that although the perturbation ( [ idata ] ) is exponentially localized , the induced perturbation of the function @xmath13 has a @xmath42 tail as follows from the hamiltonian constraint ( 4a ) .",
    "we have found that for small perturbations , that is for small values of the control parameter @xmath39 , the perturbation is scattered off to infinity and the solution returns to equilibrium , i.e. , it settles down to the kk monopole with the _ same _ parameter @xmath43 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "one might wonder why the parameter @xmath43 does not change under perturbation .",
    "the reason is simple : the perturbations considered by us have finite energy while a change of @xmath43 would require infinite energy . here by energy we mean the energy measured with respect to a given kk reference background as described by deser and soldate  @xcite .",
    "this energy is determined by the _",
    "next _ to leading order term in the asymptotic expansion at spatial infinity .    the qualitative picture of pointwise convergence to the kk monopole",
    "is shown in fig .  2 . the details of this process , in particular the role of quasinormal modes and the rate of decay of a tail , will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "we have found that a sufficiently strong kick may destabilize the kk monopole . in order to understand what is the fate of a strongly perturbed kk monopole we need to make a digression .      the kk monopole ( [ tn ] )",
    "is in fact a special case of the two - parameter family of solutions of the vacuum einstein equations in five dimensions @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 here @xmath1 , the parameter @xmath46 is positive and the parameter @xmath47 ( usually called the magnetic charge ) has the range @xmath48 . for @xmath49 the metric ( [ tnbh ] ) has the regular horizon at @xmath50 , so after @xcite we shall refer to this solution as the kaluza - klein black hole . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the horizon degenerates to a point and one gets the kk monopole ( [ tn ] ) with @xmath52 .    translating ( 12 ) into the ansatz ( [ bcs ] ) we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 note that the leading order asymptotic behavior for large @xmath17 does not depend on @xmath46 and is determined only by @xmath47 @xmath55 although the kk black holes are known in closed form , for our purposes it is helpful to look at them from the viewpoint of the shooting procedure . assuming that there is a non - degenerate horizon at @xmath56 , we obtain from ( 4 ) the following behavior @xmath57",
    "hence for each @xmath58 there is a one - parameter family of local solutions with a regular horizon parametrized by @xmath59 .",
    "shooting these local solutions towards infinity we get the kk black holes ( [ tnbh2 ] ) where @xmath60      now , we return to the discussion of numerical results . we have found that for sufficiently large perturbations the inner part of the kk monopole collapses and a horizon forms at some @xmath61 .  outside  the  horizon",
    "the solution settles down to the kk black hole ( see fig .  3 ) . as we pointed out above",
    ", the perturbations considered by us have finite energy and therefore they do not change the leading order asymptotic behavior ( [ asym ] ) . in this sense",
    "the magnetic charge @xmath47 can be viewed as the constant of motion . for the kk monopole @xmath62",
    ", so all our configurations have the same magnetic charge @xmath63 ( recall that we use units in which @xmath64 ) and the endstates of evolution differ only by @xmath46 .",
    "as we approach the threshold of collapse from above , the parameter @xmath46 decreases towards the limiting value @xmath65 corresponding to the kk monopole . at the same time , as follows from ( [ beta ] ) , both @xmath66 and @xmath67 tend to zero . in this limit",
    ", close to the horizon the kk black hole is very well approximated by the schwarzschild black hole . near the threshold we observe the type ii discretely self - similar critical behavior governed by the same critical solution as in the asymptotically flat situation @xcite ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the fact that critical collapse is a local phenomenon , and , as such , does not depend on the far field behavior .",
    "we have shown that although it is classically stable against small perturbations , the kk monopole is classically unstable against perturbations which are large enough to allow gravitational collapse to form a black hole .",
    "classically , the black hole is probably stable .",
    "quantum mechanically one expects it to emit hawking radiation which can carry off energy but not magnetic charge . in the long run",
    "therefore one might expect the system to settle down to the original kk monopole .",
    "if this is so , then the common intuition about bps states would be correct , provided one bears in mind that the stability can only hold by virtue of quantum mechanical effects .",
    "finally , we remark that , besides the kk monopole , the bcs ansatz incorporates other non - asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "in particular , an exact regular time dependent solution is known  @xcite @xmath68 this solution can be viewed as the time evolving kk monopole whose @xmath7 fibers pinch off to a point for @xmath69",
    ". it would be interesting to determine the role of this solution in dynamics .",
