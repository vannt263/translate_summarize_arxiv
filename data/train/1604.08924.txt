    "furthermore , the supersymmetry brings advantages as the requirement of a fewer number of parameters ( the only lorentz violating parameter is @xmath109 ) and the improvement of the ultraviolet behavior .",
    "in the previous section the nonrelativistic supersymmetry was obtained by the inclusion of supersymmetric but non lorentz invariant term @xmath244 into the action . the supersymmetry transformations ( [ 1.12 ] )",
    "are essentially the same as the relativistic ones , generated by supercharges which are linear in the derivatives , such that the construction of the superspace is straightforward .",
    "it is natural to investigate the possibility of incorporating the anisotropic character of space and time into the transformations of supersymmetry themselves . to this end",
    "we are tempted to introduce supercharges of the form @xmath306 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath307 is free for the moment .",
    "an immediate problem with these supercharges is that they do not satisfy the leibniz rule such that it is unclear the construction of manifestly supersymmetric actions .",
    "furthermore , they do not generate spatial translations , @xmath308 and @xmath309 although these weird points , the above supercharges generate transformations with the desirable features , i.e. , they encode the anisotropic character of space and time .",

    "is the existence of the constraints which need to be closed under supersymmetry transformations in order to produce a consistent theory .",
    "by starting with the bosonic constraint @xmath312 and performing successive transformations we end up with @xmath313 which , as required , are closed .",

    "of course , these constraints can not be obtained from the superfield expression @xmath314 .",
    "however , we can eliminate the higher derivative @xmath307-terms in the expressions in ( [ 4.6a ] ) and ( [ 4.9a ] ) just by means of a redefinition of the auxiliary field @xmath315 , such that the new transformations involve only time derivatives @xmath316 while the constraints recover the relations in ( [ 1.17 ] ) . in its turn , these new transformations are generated by the supercharges @xmath317 which are now linear operators in the derivatives .",
    "thus we can obtain a superspace formulation by introducing the covariant derivatives , @xmath318 such that @xmath319 .",
    "any action involving superfields and covariant derivatives of superfield is manifestly supersymmetric . the kinetic term constructed from ( [ 4.13a ] )",
    "gives @xmath320 where we are omitting the internal index @xmath79 .",
    "as in the previous section , in order to produce higher spatial derivative terms for @xmath74 and @xmath230 we need to include a term @xmath244 in the lagrangian , @xmath321 so it is clear that this formulation is equivalent to the case @xmath138 in the construction of sec .",
    "this lagrangian arises in the context of stochastic quantization of the nonlinear sigma model in a 2-dimensional euclidean spacetime @xcite . following the stochastic quantization recipe , we need to introduce an additional time coordinate in the system , called fictitious time , such",
    "that evolution along it is governed by a langevin equation .",
    "the fictitious time is then properly eliminated after the computation of the correlation functions , producing a 2-dimensional but quantum theory . in the construction of lifshitz theories",
    "we just keep the fictitious time and interpret it as a physical time coordinate . in this sense , the stochastic quantization gives a prescription for obtaining @xmath322-dimensional lifshitz - type theories from @xmath4-dimensional relativistic ones @xcite .",
    "the search for ultraviolet complete theories have attracted attention to lifshitz extensions of relativistic theories . adopting this procedure",
    ", we can turn nonrenormalizable theories in renormalizable ones at the price of lorentz symmetry .",
    "the most expressive case was pointed out by horava @xcite , who proposed a power counting renormalizable gravitational theory in 3 + 1 dimensions with @xmath323 .",
    "lifshitz type theories are interesting in their own right offering a new framework to investigate several field theoretical properties .",
    "furthermore , they are quite useful in the description of quantum condensed matter systems with dynamical scaling weighted by the critical exponent @xmath3 in fact , anisotropic scaling was originally proposed in the study of lifshitz points .",
    "naive dimensional analysis indicates that higher spatial derivative terms are suppressed at low energies when compared to lower derivative operators ( which in the weighted power counting are relevant operators ) .",
    "however , some perturbative renormalization group calculations @xcite show that the resurgence of lorentz invariance at low energy depends strongly on a fine - tuning of the lorentz violating parameters , in the sense that they can not be arbitrarily small since the renormalization group functions become ill - defined as a reflex of the nonrenormalizability .",
    "we call this situation of lorentz restoration in the weak form and it is what often happens within the perturbative framework of strictly renormalizable lifshitz - type models .",
    "lifshitz nonlinear sigma models admit large-@xmath0 expansion which better incorporate lorentz invariance issue at low energies than the perturbative expansion .",
    "we conclude this by computing the renormalization group flow of the coupling constant , which is sensitive to the relevant operator @xmath324 making it well defined even when @xmath109 is arbitrarily small .",
    "unfortunately , loop calculations with anisotropic propagators are hard to be thoroughly performed preventing us to determine the flow of the lorentz violating parameter . in view of these difficulties , we performed a perturbative study of the model to gain some more information concerning the running of the parameters .",
    "we obtained that the parameter @xmath109 does not run up to the considered order , i.e. , @xmath325 .",
    "we interpret this as a positive signal concerning lorentz restoration .",
    "such a behavior indicates that there is no dangerous behavior of @xmath109 under renormalization group flow that otherwise would require some fine - tuning to be tamed .",
    "we showed also that the perturbative @xmath151 is not sensitive to the presence of the relevant operator @xmath324 , contrarily to the result of the large-@xmath0 behavior .",
    "in the course of these studies we come across some interesting questions . in the perturbative context , we find a potential interacting theory possessing anisotropic scale invariance at quantum level .",
    "this type of model can be useful in condensed matter systems to describe a universality class of quantum phase transitions with @xmath1 in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "some technical issues were also addressed in the beginning the work , namely , the construction of generalized sigma models . in the relativistic context ,",
    "such constructions are interesting since they put together a class of models exhibiting common features such as asymptotic freedom and an infinite number of non - local classical conserved charges @xcite .",
    "our intention was to describe a more general framework for constructing lifshitz - type models .",
    "for example , by choosing @xmath70 we obtain an anisotropic @xmath1 version of the @xmath39 model @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the model exhibits the same general pattern concerning low - energy lorentz restoration as the nonsupersymmetric counterpart , corresponding to the restoration in the strong form .",
    "the beta function of the coupling constant is well behaved when @xmath149 and the advantage is that it is the only one lorentz violating parameter required by renormalizability .",
    "this is a basic consequence of the improvement of ultraviolet behavior enforced by supersymmetry .",
    "the general construction of lifshitz - type supersymmetric theories is challenging .",
    "as it is known , the canceling of divergences becomes automatic when formulated in superspace . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of superspace in lifshitz theories is problematic .",
    "this is so because the natural candidates for supercharges generating anisotropic transformations involve higher spatial derivatives such that they no longer satisfy the leibniz rule .",
    "hence it is hard to write down manifestly supersymmetric actions and even the notion of chiral and anti - chiral superfields is obscure .    the case considered here does not suffer from these problems since we keep the supersymmetry transformations unchanged compared to the relativistic ones .",
    "the anisotropic character of space and time is induced by the inclusion of a supersymmetric but non lorentz invariant term @xmath244 .",
    "when trying to discuss modifications in the supercharges , we end up with a theory with the supersymmetry only in the time direction , being equivalent to the stochastic quantization supersymmetry arising in the fictitious time .",
    "further studies are necessary to ultimately establish the lorentz restoration in the strong form .",
    "this involves the determination of the renormalization group flow of all parameters of the theory , but certainly it would require to go beyond our analytic computations , being necessary to resort to numerical methods .",
    "in addition , the future direction is to extend these investigations to other lifshitz - type theories which admit large-@xmath0 expansion .",
    "of course , their usefulness in high - energy physics is highlighted whenever we are able to identify lorentz invariant sectors in their spectrum .",
