    "the brw examined here was not intentionally fabricated to produce entangled photons . designed to optimize pair production and upconversion efficiency @xcite ,",

    "an interesting asymmetry observed in this work is the level of the minima measured in the h / v basis .",
    "the origins of this small but appreciable h / h background are likely due to residual pump fluorescence and/or polarization hybridization in the v - polarized down converted mode",
    ". nonetheless , these effects are not fundamental limitations , but arise from the current design and fabrication method .",
    "future samples that are optimized to produce entanglement @xcite promise to avoid this behaviour .    despite the many material benefits that gaas offers ( order of magnitude stronger @xmath10 than typical crystals , large transparency window , monolithicity , integratability etc . )",
    ", it has remained a prized but elusive non - linear material . entirely due to its challenging phase matching requirements , gaas based photon sources",
    "have been overshadowed in the quantum community by materials such as , lithium niobate , pottasium titanyl phosphate , and barium borate which are easier to phase match .",
    "indeed , in juxtaposition , efforts have been aimed at _ integrating _ these materials @xcite . as an alternative to gaas",
    ", high quality integrated quantum photonic circuitry has been developed in silica @xcite , but as an entangled photon source , its optical non - linearity is weaker @xcite , and still has its challenges to become a fully integrated platform viable for quantum processes .    for gaas , techniques have been developed to solve the phase matching problem such as form - birefringence @xcite ; out of plane pumping @xcite ; or quasi - phase matching by traditional periodic crystal inversion @xcite .",
    "further , out of plane pumping has the benefit of producing counter - propagating entangled photons @xcite .",
    "but while these designs are promising , most are not truly monolithic , and are at greater risk of becoming encumbered with the complications of integration with other photonic components .",
    "in contrast , the brw design has now shown to be capable of solving all of the above concerns .",
    "it is favourable for becoming its own pump laser @xcite , it is efficient at producing pairs @xcite , and here we demonstrate a very distinct `` quantum '' opportunity . gained by a clever modal phase matching technique that exploits mature nanofabrication technology , the gaas based brw can produce useful polarization entangled photons directly and without the need for any post selection , compensation or interferometry .",
    "ironically , its success is tied to the difficulty in phase matching ",
    "gaas s lack of birefringence turns out to be a virtue for the production of on chip entanglement .",
    "combined with the many aforementioned benefits that gaas has to offer , these latest results show that the brw platform should be seriously considered among the integrated quantum photonics community as one of the most promising platforms on which to build integrated optical quantum information processing devices .",

    "output light emerging from the core at the back facet was filtered to remove the pump before being collected for measurement .    for the single photon spectrum measurements , @xmath15 was approximately 20 - 30  mw .",
    "the output was transmitted through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) separating the light into distinct h and v ports .",
    "individually , both output ports were sent into a czerny - turner type monochromator equipped with a novel , high timing resolution , free space ingaas / inp single photon avalanche diode @xcite .",
    "spectra for both polarizations were obtained for the range of cw - pump central frequencies from @xmath16  nm in increments of about 0.1 - 0.2  nm .    to characterize polarization entanglement ,",
    "@xmath15 was set to approximately @xmath17  mw , and the pbs was replaced by a dbs with a central wavelength @xmath18 1560  nm , and a width of @xmath19 10  nm .",
    "the pump wavelength was set to @xmath20  nm , which produced photon pairs via spdc with wavelengths near @xmath21 ( signal )  nm and @xmath22  nm ( idler ) .",
    "lower energy ( @xmath231560  nm ) idler photons were transmitted , while higher energy ( @xmath241560  nm ) signal photons were reflected . a polarization analyzer , consisting of a qwp , a half wave plate ( hwp ) , and a linear sheet polarizer , was placed in each of the signal and idler arms . an additional qwp , which could be tilted , was placed in the idler arm to control the relative phase @xmath5 between hv and vh pairs .",
    "each arm collected photons into a multi - mode fiber connected to a single photon detector ( id201 , idquantique ) .",

    "the idler arm  gated by counts recorded in the signal arm  was set at 15% efficiency and the gate time was set to @xmath29  ns . optical and electronic delays were adjusted so that the arrival of the idler photon coincided with the electronic gate signal .",
    "thus , idler count rates were effectively pair count rates , and were anywhere from 7 - 100 cps .    for the tomographic reconstruction of the state , an overcomplete set of 36 polarization measurements",
    "were performed ; setting the polarization analyzers for every combination of h , v , anti - diagonal , diagonal , left - circular , and right - circular .",
    "each measurement had a duration of 2 minutes .",

    "thus we can safely ignore events where both photons are routed to the same output port of the dbs .",
    "this assumption also implies that the effect of the dichroic on the amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are minimal , and so we retain the same labeling before and after the dbs transformation .",

    "this is the main reason for the reduced visibilities and entanglement quality observed in the experiment .    finally , we analyze the resulting polarization state of the photon pair when the spectral information is disregarded .",

    "it is also worth emphasizing that if the overlap is perfect then @xmath57 and the state produced by the brw would be maximally entangled in the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "the above analysis allows us to predict the entanglement visibilities based upon the observed spectrum of the generated photons . as in the experiment , when the signal polarizer is set to transmit anti - diagonal polarization , and the idler polarizer is rotated about an axis perpendicular to its face by some angle @xmath58 , then the observed coincidence count , c , is proportional to @xmath59 .",

    "<S> * creating miniature chip scale implementations of optical quantum information protocols is a dream for many in the quantum optics community . </S>",
    "<S> this is largely because of the promise of stability and scalability . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a monolithically integratable chip architecture upon which is built a photonic device primitive called a bragg reflection waveguide ( brw ) . </S>",
    "<S> implemented in gallium arsenide , we show that , via the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion , the brw is capable of directly producing polarization entangled photons without additional path difference compensation , spectral filtering or post - selection . after splitting the twin - photons immediately </S>",
    "<S> after they emerge from the chip , we perform a variety of correlation tests on the photon pairs and show non - classical behaviour in their polarization . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the brw s versatile architecture our results signify the brw design as a serious contender on which to build large scale implementations of optical quantum processing devices . *    </S>",
    "<S> the use of non - linear optical effects has lead to an era of high - level quantum experiments , where quantum entanglement between pairs of photons can be achieved with very high count rates , quality and flexibility . </S>",
    "<S> it has relied heavily on a photon pair producing process called spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc)@xcite , where under conservation of energy and momentum , a `` pump '' photon spontaneously decays , leaving a pair of daughter photons in its place . </S>",
    "<S> spdc is now easily achieved using lasers and the same materials and principles involved in the more classical processes of sum frequency and second harmonic generation .    </S>",
    "<S> more challenging has been the creation of _ entangled _ photon pairs in a degree of freedom , in our case polarization , that is uncorrelated with other aspects of the pair producing process @xcite . the challenge is indirectly tied to the very same principles and materials that facilitate the creation of photon pairs in the first place . </S>",
    "<S> birefringence , which makes phase matching the pump and daughter photons an easy task , also tends to provide distinguishing information that hinders the production of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> despite this natural limitation , bulk - crystal photon sources have created entanglement via clever interference techniques , and often include additional compensating optics @xcite . while some outstanding results have been achieved @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> too often the interferometers and compensation procedures are unstable , requiring daily maintenance , strict environmental conditions , or complicated automation . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally thought that , to achieve larger scale demonstrations of optical quantum information protocols , the techniques developed to date should be integrated in some sense @xcite  a so called optical bench on a chip .        </S>",
    "<S> semiconductors are an obvious platform for integration , but the material physics are vastly different from what is found in traditional spdc based resources of quantum information . recently publicized as a strong source of photon pairs @xcite the gallium arsenide ( gaas ) based bragg reflection waveguide ( brw ) was shown to have a distinct advantage over other semiconductor sources , due largely to its monolithic architecture  its layered design underpinning many photonic devices . using the same techniques as employed in bulk - crystal sources @xcite , it has recently been shown that the brw can deliver polarization entangled photons through the use of post - selection . here </S>",
    "<S> we show a significant advantage by demonstrating the intrinsic capability of the brw to directly produce polarization entangled photon pairs , without any additional interferometry , spectral filtering , compensation or post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the fact that the structure can be its own pump laser @xcite , our results set the stage for the brw to be a self - contained room temperature resource of entanglement occupying no more than a few square millimeters of chip real - estate .    </S>",
    "<S> built on a gaas substrate , the brw consists entirely of layers of gaas containing different amounts of aluminum . </S>",
    "<S> a subset of the layers function as bragg reflectors , one lying below and one on top of a core region where light can be guided . a schematic </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bragg reflectors distinguish the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to optical modes guided via the process of total internal reflection ( tir ) , the reflectors confine modes of light to the core region through interference . aptly named , the dispersion characteristics of bragg modes are mostly independent from those of the more traditional tir modes . </S>",
    "<S> this degree of freedom allows the designer to use bragg interference to create structures where the daughter tir modes of spdc are perfectly phase matched to the pump bragg modes @xcite  a technique called modal phase matching .    </S>",
    "<S> modal phase matching based on bragg reflection has important ramifications for integrated optical quantum devices that employ spdc . not only </S>",
    "<S> does the brw allow for the production of photon pairs in non - birefringent semiconductors like gaas @xcite , but the detrimental effects of any residual birefringence on the production of polarization entangled photons are minimal and design related . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the gaas based brw can be engineered such that the optical properties of orthogonally polarized tir modes are identical . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , inherent polarization entanglement becomes possible for frequency _ non - degenerate _ co - linear type - ii modal phase matching where daughter photons are generated at different frequencies but guaranteed to have orthogonal polarization . </S>",
    "<S> because there is little to no birefringence , the daughter photons can emerge orthogonally polarized via two different decay `` channels '' : in one channel , there is a probability amplitude @xmath0 where the higher ( lower ) frequency photon is horizontally ( vertically ) polarized . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , there is a probability amplitude @xmath1 where the higher ( lower ) frequency photon is vertically ( horizontally ) polarized . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for compensation of any kind , and since the photons within a pair always have different frequencies , each pair can be easily split into distinct spatial arms , which we call signal and idler , by using a dichroic beam splitter ( dbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expected state is polarization entangled and written as : @xmath2 , \\label{eq : state : brw : dichroic}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where h(v ) symbolizes horizontal(vertical ) polarization , @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the angular frequency of the photon , and @xmath5 accounts for a relative phase which can be controlled by placing and tilting a birefringent element such as a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) in one of either the signal or idler arm . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sum , @xmath6 , is proportional to the joint spectral amplitude of the photon pairs generated by the brw , and that the index interchange in the second term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : state : brw : dichroic ] arises from the dbs transformation , which collapses the entire spectral output of the brw to either the signal or idler arm . for a more in depth analysis of the generated quantum states in the presence of a dbs , please refer to the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> two - photon polarization entanglement quality is inexorably linked to the absence of any information that might determine the polarization of either photon before it is measured . in our case , it is pre - dominantly limited by the amount of spectral overlap between @xmath0 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we measured the spectrum of both h and v polarized photons produced by the brw for a range of pump wavelengths ( @xmath8  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> details of this measurement can be found in the methods section . </S>",
    "<S> the results , depicted in fig .  [ fig : figure3 ] , show clear similarities between the two orthogonally polarized spectra . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , they point to an inherent ambiguity in determining the polarization of any one photon by acquiring knowledge of its wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> our observations imply that , for our experimental setup , a pump frequency setting of @xmath9  nm is optimal for producing frequency non - degenerate polarization entangled photons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that such spectral evidence of two different decay channels is in contradistinction to the spectra of typical type - ii spdc where , when pumping away from degeneracy , only a single decay channel is observed . in those sources , </S>",
    "<S> the underlying crystal lattice asymmetry yields significant birefringence that prevents a second decay channel from being simultaneously phase matched . here however , the absence of lattice _ </S>",
    "<S> asymmetry _ in gaas ( no birefringence ) means that fundamentally , where an h - v signal - idler pair can have the correct phase matching , so can a v - h pair . from a polarization entanglement perspective , this is an extremely desirable phase matching scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the brw design is therefore advantageous because it not only solves the historically challenging problem of phase matching in non birefringent media , but the possibility of entanglement emerges as a naturally occurring byproduct .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] </S>"
