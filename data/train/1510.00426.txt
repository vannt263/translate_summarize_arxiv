    "let @xmath0 be a triangulated category , let @xmath1 be an abelian category , and let @xmath2 be a homological functor .",
    "suppose we wish to use @xmath3 in order to approximate the triangulated category @xmath0 by the abelian category  @xmath1 .",
    "generally speaking , it is possible to consider cellular or similar decompositions of the objects of  @xmath0 in order to set up adams - type spectral sequences ; see e.g.  @xcite for a very broad - ranging formulation of this idea . on the other hand , @xmath3 could already be an equivalence ; but then @xmath1 is necessarily semi - simple , so this case is not so interesting .",
    "the next simplest thing that could happen is what is often called a `` universal coefficient theorem '' , or `` uct '' for short , and will be the focus of this article .",
    "in this case there are certain canonical short exact sequences @xmath4 &    { \\mathrm{ext}}^1_{\\mathcal{a}}(h\\sigma x , h y ) \\ar[r ] &    { \\mathrm{hom}}_{\\mathcal{t}}(x , y ) \\ar[r ] &    { \\mathrm{hom}}_{\\mathcal{a}}(hx , hy ) \\ar[r ] &     0   } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determining the hom groups of @xmath0 up to a one - step extension problem ( see def.[defi : uct ] ) .",
    "typically , this happens when the abelian category @xmath1 has global dimension one , in which case   can be seen as a result of the early collapse of the aforementioned spectral sequence .",
    "the prototypical example is when @xmath5 is the derived category of a hereditary ring and @xmath6 is the functor taking a complex to its graded homology module . the versions for graded or dg  algebras are also classical ( see example  [ ex : classical_uct ] ) , and are the source of the more basic uct and knneth exact sequences in the topologist s arsenal .",
    "there are also situations where the uct exact sequence only holds for specific pairs @xmath7 of objects of  @xmath0 .",
    "one such result , widely used by operator algebraists and noncommutative geometers , is the uct of rosenberg and schochet  @xcite ( see example  [ ex : classical_uct_kk ] ) .",
    "it applies to @xmath8 , the kasparov category of separable complex c*-algebras , where now @xmath1 is the category of @xmath9-graded abelian groups and @xmath10 is the topological k - theory functor . in this example @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are two c*-algebras , and for the uct to hold @xmath11 must belong to the so - called bootstrap class , that is , the localizing subcategory of @xmath13 generated by  @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , there are also examples of ucts which hold for all @xmath11 in some suitably nice subcategory , where however the abelian category @xmath1 is _ not _ of global dimension one .",
    "what happens in these cases is that although there exist objects in @xmath1 of infinite projective dimension , the homological functor @xmath3 takes values only in objects of projective dimension one  which suffices to establish the uct .",
    "such `` exotic '' examples have arisen in recent years in the work of ralf meyer and collaborators on certain variants of kk - theory ( see the references in   [ sec : kk ] ) .",
    "our goal is to build on their insights in order to provide a unified conceptual framework for understanding and proving such ucts .",
    "we make throughout the following hypothesis , which seems to cover all naturally occurring situations :    the homological functor @xmath3 is the restricted yoneda functor induced by a small full suspension closed subcategory @xmath15 . that is to say",
    ", @xmath16 is the abelian category @xmath17 of right @xmath18-modules ( i.e.  contravariant additive functors on  @xmath19 ) and @xmath3 is the functor @xmath20 sending an object @xmath11 to the right @xmath19-module @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath5 or @xmath22 we would choose @xmath19 to consists of all the suspensions of @xmath23 or @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the `` exotic '' examples are more involved .",
    "it follows from standard homological algebra that , in order to establish a uct exact sequence for a pair @xmath7 of objects in  @xmath0 , it suffices that @xmath11 belongs to the localizing subcategory generated by  @xmath19 and that the @xmath19-module @xmath24 has projective dimension one ( see theorem  [ thm : uct ] for details ) .",
    "this leads us to :    [ question : general ] how can we recognize those full subcategories @xmath15 for which we have @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , and therefore a uct exact sequence [ eq : uct_intro ] for all pairs of objects @xmath7 with @xmath27 ?    as it turns out , in all the examples where this works that we are aware of , the category @xmath19 is _",
    "1-gorenstein _ ( see  [ sec : recoll_gor ] ) .",
    "this entails for instance the observed dichotomy that @xmath19-modules have either projective dimension at most one , or are of infinite projective dimension .",
    "this observation is quite useful , because gorenstein rings and categories are rather well - behaved and gorenstein homological algebra is already a well - developed subject .    with this in mind , we can now break down question  [ question : general ] into the two following more manageable subquestions :    [ question:1 ] how can we tell when a given small category @xmath19 is 1-gorenstein ?    [ question:2 ] given a 1-gorenstein subcategory @xmath15 , how do we know whether the homological functor @xmath20 only takes values in @xmath19-modules of finite ( hence @xmath28 ) projective dimension ?",
    "note that question  [ question:1 ] is independent of the ambient triangulated category . on the contrary , question  [ question:2 ] , as we shall see , crucially depends both on the embedding @xmath15 and on the triangulation of  @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , our answers to both questions will turn out to work uniformly for @xmath29-gorenstein categories for all @xmath30 ( @xmath29 being the gorenstein dimension of  @xmath19 , which is equal to both the maximum finite projective and the maximum finite injective dimension that @xmath19-modules can have ) .    * * *    let us outline the main results and sketch the organization of the paper .",
    "the first part of the article (  [ sec : gtp]-[sec : triangulated_few ] ) is dedicated to answering question  [ question:1 ] .",
    "after some theoretical setup , we succeed in proving several criteria for recognizing gorenstein small categories , the more concrete of which can be applied to descriptions of @xmath19 by generators and relations , i.e. , by `` looking at  @xmath19 '' .",
    "our general philosophy is that a gorenstein category is one which is , in some sense , sufficiently symmetric over some base gorenstein ring or category .",
    "we prove for instance :    let @xmath19 be a small category such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath19 is bounded , that is , for any fixed object @xmath31 there are only finitely many objects of @xmath19 mapping nontrivially into or out of  @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath19 is an @xmath23-category , with @xmath23 an @xmath29-gorenstein ring ( e.g.  @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "the hom @xmath23-modules @xmath35 are all finitely generated projective .",
    "each unit map @xmath36 , @xmath31 , admits an @xmath23-linear retraction .",
    "@xmath19 admits a serre functor relative to  @xmath23 , that is , a self - equivalence @xmath37 equipped with a natural isomorphism @xmath38    then @xmath19 is @xmath29-gorenstein .",
    "this criterion can be easily applied to obtain new proofs of well - known examples of gorenstein rings and categories , for instance group algebras and groupoid categories ( example  [ ex : groupalgebras ] ) , or categories of chain complexes ( example  [ ex : complexes ] ) .",
    "we also prove a more complicated version of the above result where , as it were , the gorenstein base @xmath23 is allowed to change from object to object ; see theorem  [ thm : gorenstein ] .",
    "this will be used to show that a certain exotic uct for the equivariant kk - theory of c*-algebras also arises from a 1-gorenstein category ; see theorem  [ thm : eq - kk - gore ] .",
    "we also prove the following criterion , which generalizes results of neeman and beligiannis , and is of a rather different spirit :    [ thm : triangulated_n_gorenstein_intro ] let @xmath19 be a triangulated category which admits a skeleton with at most @xmath39 morphisms .",
    "then @xmath19 is @xmath40-gorenstein for some @xmath41 .",
    "the second part of our article (  [ sec : exact_vs_fd]-[sec : gore_closed ] ) addresses question  [ question:2 ] .",
    "this time our criteria are less concrete , and thus harder to apply in practice , but on the other hand they provide a fully satisfying conceptual answer .",
    "namely , what the next theorem says is that the answer to question  [ question:2 ] is positive precisely when the singularity category of @xmath19 ( see remark  [ rem : sing ] ) can be generated by syzygies of distinguished triangles contained in @xmath42 , the additive hull of  @xmath19 inside  @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of a gorenstein projective module is recalled in   [ sec : recoll_gor ] .",
    "( the local coherence hypothesis in the theorem is a very mild one and is satisfied by all the examples we have . )",
    "let @xmath19 be a small suspension closed full subcategory of a triangulated category  @xmath0 , and assume that @xmath19 is gorenstein and that @xmath17 is locally coherent",
    ". then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the @xmath19-module @xmath24 has finite projective dimension for every object @xmath43 .",
    "[ it : syzygy ] for every finitely presented gorenstein projective @xmath19-module  @xmath44 , there exists a distinguished triangle @xmath45 in @xmath42 such that @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   there exists a set @xmath47 of finitely presented gorenstein projective @xmath19-modules such that : * every @xmath48 occurs as a syzygy of a triangle in @xmath42 , as in  . * the modules of @xmath47 ,",
    "together with the finitely presented projectives , generate all finitely presented gorenstein projectives by extensions and retracts .",
    "4 .   if @xmath49 is a morphism in @xmath42 such that the image of @xmath50 is gorenstein projective , then the cone of @xmath49 is also in @xmath42 .",
    "if the equivalent conditions of the theorem are satisfied we say that @xmath19 is _ gorenstein closed _ in  @xmath0 .",
    "it is now easy to combine the above results with general homological algebra in order to obtain the following new abstract form of the uct :    [ thm : main_simplified ] let @xmath0 be a triangulated category admitting arbitrary set - indexed coproducts .",
    "let @xmath15 be a small suspension closed full subcategory of compact objects , and assume that @xmath19 is 1-gorenstein and gorenstein closed in  @xmath0 , as above",
    ". then the uct sequence with respect to @xmath19 is exact for all @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , we have the following dichotomy for an arbitrary @xmath19-module  @xmath44 :    * either @xmath51 and @xmath52 for some @xmath53 , * or @xmath54 and @xmath44 is not of the form @xmath24 for any @xmath55 .",
    "to see how powerful this form of the uct really is , choose @xmath19 to be the sucategory of all compact objects in  @xmath0 , and combine it with theorem  [ thm : triangulated_n_gorenstein_intro ] ; the result is neeman s general form of the brown - adams representability theorem  @xcite :    let @xmath56 be a compactly generated triangulated category whose subcategory of compact objects , @xmath57 , admits a countable skeleton .",
    "then every cohomological functor on @xmath57 is representable by an object of  @xmath0 and every natural transformation between such functors is induced by a map in  @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is locally coherent but hardly ever locally noetherian .",
    "thus in order to deduce brown - adams representability from our uct , as above , it is crucial that we do not make any unnecessary noetherian hypotheses in our theory .",
    "we also point out that theorem  [ thm : main_simplified ] is actually only a special case of theorem  [ thm : gore_uct ] .",
    "indeed , the latter applies also to triangulated categories that do not necessarily have all small coproducts ; for instance , it has a variant that works for small idempotent complete triangulated categories , or for categories with only countable coproducts .",
    "this is necessary if we want to cover the examples from kk - theory , which typically yields categories of the latter kind .",
    "in order to uniformly treat all possibilities , throughout section   [ sec : uct ] we consider triangulated categories admitting all coproducts indexed by sets whose size is bounded by a fixed cardinal  @xmath58 . as this complicates things a little , we carefully reprove in this setting all the homological algebra we need .    as a by - product of our cardinal tracking",
    ", we also prove a countable variant of brown - adams representability which seems to have remained unrecorded so far ; see theorem  [ thm : countable_brown - adams ] .",
    "finally , section   [ sec : kk ] applies the above results to the motivating exotic examples of ucts discovered in the realm of kk - theory .",
    "more precisely we show how to obtain new proofs , as corollaries of ( the countable version of ) theorem  [ thm : main_simplified ] , for two of these theorems ( see theorems  [ thm : umct_gore ] and  [ thm : filt - kk - gore - closed ] ) ; moreover , in one case where we ( still ) do nt have a complete new proof , we nonetheless prove that the uct in question fits perfectly into our framework ( see [ thm : eq - kk - gore ] ) .    the last result of our paper , theorem  [ thm : kk_brown_adams ] , applies the above - mentioned countable version of brown - adams representability to the kk - theoretic setting .",
    "we will work over a fixed base commutative ring  @xmath59 , which in the examples will usually be a field or the ring of integers  @xmath60 . thus ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , all categories are @xmath59-categories and all functors are assumed to be @xmath59-linear ; the symbol @xmath61 will stand for the tensor product @xmath62 over  @xmath59 , @xmath63 for the @xmath59-category of @xmath59-linear functors @xmath64 , and so on .",
    "if @xmath18 is a small @xmath59-category and @xmath65 are two objects , we will often write @xmath66 for the hom set @xmath67 considered as a bimodule over the rings @xmath68 and @xmath69 . we will write @xmath70 for the @xmath59-category of right @xmath19-modules , i.e. , of @xmath59-linear functors @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the full subcategory of finitely presentable @xmath19-modules .",

    "2.5 ) . using this",
    ", we will often evaluate @xmath19-modules on finitely generated projectives , by a slight abuse of notation .    some ( rather straightforward ) conventions involving cardinal numbers will be introduced in terminology  [ ter : cardinals ] .",
    "we are very grateful to ralf meyer for asking us the interesting questions that have prompted our collaboration .",
    "thanks are also due to him for first noticing that the gorenstein closed condition of theorem  [ thm : exact_detection ] is not only sufficient but also necessary .",
