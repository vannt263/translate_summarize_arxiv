    "recently , chaotic boltzmann machines @xcite were proposed as a deterministic implementation of boltzmann machines .",
    "the apparently stochastic behavior of chaotic boltzmann machines is achieved , without any use of random numbers , by chaotic dynamics that emerges from pseudo - billiard dynamics .",
    "it was shown numerically that the chaotic billiard dynamics of chaotic boltzmann machines can be used for generating sample sequences from the probabilistic distribution of boltzmann machines , and it was successfully applied to other spin models such as the ising model and the potts model @xcite .    despite these numerical evidences ,",
    "there have been no theoretical proof that chaotic boltzmann machines yield samples from the probabilistic distribution of the corresponding boltzmann machines .    in this brief note , as a first step of theoretical approach , we investigate the simplest system .",
    "namely , we show that chaotic boltzmann machines truly yield samples for the corresponding boltzmann machines if they are composed of only two elements .",
    "although our approach can not be applied to larger chaotic boltzmann machines with more than two elements , we expect that it gives some insights into the dynamics of larger chaotic boltzmann machines .    since the proof is not entirely trivial , it is considered worth making available on arxiv .",
    "this note is an english translation ( with slight modifications ) of the article @xcite originally written in japanese .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be random variables that take values on @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the probabilistic model @xmath3 $ ] is given in the form of conditional probabilities @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] , which is common in boltzmann machines and many other spin models in statistical physics .",
    "let us consider a chaotic boltzmann machine for the probabilistic model .",
    "in addition to the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the elements , we introduce internal states @xmath8 and @xmath9 $ ] of the elements . therefore",
    ", the state space of the chaotic boltzmann machine is @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the internal states @xmath8 and @xmath11 evolve according to the following differential equations : @xmath12^{-1 } , \\label{eq : dx1}\\\\ \\frac{dx_2}{dt } & = ( 1 - 2s_2 ) c_2(s_1 ) p[s_2\\mid s_1]^{-1 } , \\label{eq : dx2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 represents arbitrary positive constants defined for each state of the other element . when the internal state @xmath14 reaches @xmath15 or @xmath16 , the state @xmath17 of the element changes as follows : @xmath18 the internal state @xmath19 moves straight inside the unit square @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] , and changes its direction when it hits a side of the square .",
    "therefore , this system can be understood as a pseudo - billiard in the billiard table @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "what we expect here is that the state variables @xmath6 and @xmath21 observed from this system follow the distribution @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "namely , our goal in this note is to show the following proposition .    for any initial values",
    "@xmath23 ^ 2 $ ] , the chaotic boltzmann machine defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dx1])([eq : ds0 ] ) satisfies @xmath24 \\label{eq : pss}\\ ] ] for @xmath25 , provided that @xmath26 is irrational . here ,",
    "@xmath27 is kronecker s delta function , and @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "to show this proposition , we rewrite eqs .  ( [ eq : dx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dx2 ] ) of the chaotic boltzmann machine . specifically , instead of the state @xmath29 of each element , we introduce a new state variable @xmath30 using the map @xmath31 then the state space @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] of the chaotic boltzmann machine is mapped to the rectangular @xmath32\\times[-r_2(1),r_2(0)]$ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sspace ] ) . on this state space ,",
    "the dynamics of the chaotic boltzmann machine ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dx1])([eq : ds0 ] ) ) is rewritten as follows : @xmath33^{-1 } = \\frac{r_1(s_1)r_2(s_2)}{p[s_1,s_2 ] } , \\label{eq : dy1 } \\\\",
    "\\frac{dy_2}{dt } & =   r_2(s_2 ) c_2(s_1 ) p[s_2|s_1]^{-1 } = \\frac{r_1(s_1)r_2(s_2)}{p[s_1,s_2 ] } , \\label{eq : dy2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath34 where the state @xmath17 can be determined from @xmath35 as @xmath36 when @xmath37 , and @xmath38 when @xmath39 .     the state space for @xmath40 . ]",
    "the differential equations ( [ eq : dy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) always satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the state @xmath40 moves in the direction of @xmath42 in the rectangular state space . here",
    "we introduce @xmath43 which moves along the orbit of @xmath40 at a constant velocity @xmath44 .",
    "then the orbit of @xmath43 is equidistributed in the state space in the following sense .",
    "let us consider the poincar section on @xmath45 . while the value of @xmath46 changes by @xmath47 , the value of @xmath48 changes by the same amount",
    ". therefore , the poincar map on @xmath45 is a rigid rotation with rotation number @xmath49 . if the rotation number is irrational , the poincar map is ergodic with respect to the uniform distribution . then the orbit is also equidistributed in the state space , and we have @xmath50 since @xmath40 moves along the same orbit as @xmath43 with the velocity described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dy2 ] ) , we have @xmath51,\\ ] ] which completes the proof .",
    "in this brief note , we have shown that chaotic boltzmann machines with two elements have quasi - periodic dynamics and yield samples from the probabilistic distribution of the corresponding boltzmann machines , provided that the rotation number is irrational .",
    "the set of parameter values @xmath52 that make rotation numbers rational has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "this is analogous to probabilistic monte carlo sampling , which does not work with probability ( measure ) zero .",
    "however , when we design chaotic boltzmann machines artificially , it may be possible that the rotation number easily becomes rational .",
    "in such a case , we have to adjust @xmath52 by multiplying some constants to make the rotation number irrational .",
    "the performance as an sampling algorithm depends on the characteristics of the rotation number . at least , a chaotic boltzmann machine with a good rotation number that yields a low - discrepancy sequence is expected to exhibit better performance than the corresponding boltzmann machine .",
    "our approach in this note can not be applied to larger chaotic boltzmann machines with more than two elements , which exhibit chaotic behavior . however",
    ", some aspects are expected to be shared with larger systems ; for example , our preliminary numerical study shows that irrationality is important , for chaotic boltzmann machines composed of not many but more than two elements , to generate faithful sample sequences .",
    "therefore , we expect that our approach gives some insights into the dynamics of larger chaotic boltzmann machines ."
