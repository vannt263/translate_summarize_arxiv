    "oscillating flows play a central role in fluid dynamics , their key appearances in various applications in medicine , biophysics , geophysics , engineering , astrophysics , acoustics are well known . in this note we consider inviscid oscillating incompressible flows driven by an oscillating in time body force ( in particular , it can be a rotating body force ) . for doing that we use the two - timing method .",
    "our main result is the deriving of a general and simple form of the averaged euler s equations by the two - timing method .",
    "the used two - timing technique is taken in the same form as in @xcite .",
    "there are many attempts to describe the fluid flows with very complex boundary conditions by the replacing of moving and deforming boundaries by various body forces .",
    "these research directions are motivated by important applications in such areas as turbo - machinery , biological and medical fluid dynamics .",
    "the most popular approaches here are the penalization method and the immersed boundary methods , see @xcite .",
    "however it is surprising that until now the averaged equations of flows cased by oscillating body forces has escaped any attention of researchers .",
    "we study the dynamics of a homogeneous inviscid incompressible fluid with velocity field @xmath0 and vorticity @xmath1 ( asterisks mark dimensional variables ) . the governing equations in cartesian coordinates @xmath2 and time @xmath3 are @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a given external body force being a periodic function of variable @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a given frequency . for brevity",
    "we include the constant density into @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "also for simplicity we accept that the fluid fills all three dimensional space .",
    "we accept that the considered class of oscillating flows possesses the characteristic scales of velocity @xmath11 , length @xmath12 , and frequency @xmath8 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dependent time - scale .",
    "the dimensionless ( not asteriated ) variables and frequency are @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the small parameter of our asymptotic theory . in the dimensionless variables",
    "takes place @xmath17 here and below we do not write the condition @xmath18 , but always keep it in mind .",
    "we consider the solutions of in the two - timing form with two time - variables @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two _ mutually dependent _ time - variables ( we call @xmath20 _ slow time _ and @xmath21 _ fast time _ ) .",
    "then the use of the chain rule brings to the form @xmath22 where the subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath20 stand for the partial derivatives .",
    "the key suggestion of the two - timing method is @xmath23 as a result , we convert from a pde with independent variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 into a pde with the extended number of independent variables @xmath26 and @xmath25 . then the solutions of must have a functional form : @xmath27 it should be emphasized , that without a functional form of solutions can be different from ; indeed the presence of the dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath28 allows one to build an infinite number of different time - scales , not just @xmath21 and @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we accept and analyse the related averaged equations and solutions in the functional form .    to make further analytic progress",
    ", we introduce few convenient notations and agreements . here and below",
    "we assume that _ any dimensionless function _",
    "@xmath29 has the following properties :    \\(i ) @xmath30 and all its required for consideration @xmath25- , @xmath20- , and @xmath21-derivatives are also @xmath31 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath32 is @xmath33-periodic in @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath34 ( about this technical simplification see the discussion section ) ;    \\(iii ) @xmath35 has an average given by @xmath36    \\(iv ) @xmath32 can be split into averaged and purely oscillating parts @xmath37 where _ tilde - functions _ ( or purely oscillating functions ) are such that @xmath38 and the _ bar - functions _",
    "@xmath39 ( or the averaged functions @xmath40 ) are @xmath21-independent ;    \\(v ) we introduce a special notation @xmath41 ( with a superscript @xmath21 ) for the _ tilde - integration _ of tilde - functions , such integration keeps the result in the tilde - class . for doing that we notice that the integral of a tilde - function @xmath42 often does not belong to the tilde - class . in order to keep the result of integration in the tilde - class",
    "we should subtract the average @xmath43 the tilde - integration is inverse to the @xmath21-differentiation @xmath44 ; the proof is omitted .",
    "here we emphasize that in all text below all large or small parameters are represented by various degrees of @xmath45 only ; these parameters appear as explicit multipliers in all formulae containing tilde- and bar - functions ; while these functions are always of order one .",
    "let us make some amplitude specification in @xmath46 where we have chosen the magnitudes of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "mathematically , this choice is required for balancing the first term @xmath49 in the equation with other terms of the same order .",
    "physically , the choice of the force as @xmath50 is dictated by the fact that the flow is driven by this force , so , it has to be of the highest available order of magnitude .    we have also made a simplifying suggestion ( just for this note ) : the given body force is chosen as being a purely oscillatory function with a zero mean @xmath51 .",
    "the explicit introduction of @xmath52 converts into @xmath53 we are looking for the solutions in the form of regular series @xmath54 the substitution of ( [ basic-4aa ] ) into ( [ main - eq ] ) produces the equations for successive approximations .",
    "_ the equations of zero approximation _ of ( [ main - eq ] ) are @xmath55 the bar - parts of these equations give us @xmath56 while the tilde - parts lead to the conclusion @xmath57 taking the divergence of the first equation we obtain the poisson equation for @xmath58 @xmath59 which can be solved provided the boundary conditions at infinity are given .",
    "this solution can be symbolically written as : @xmath60 the boundary conditions at infinity can be chosen as @xmath61 as @xmath62 . at the same time we can consider the class of functions @xmath63 which are rapidly decaying as @xmath64 or @xmath65 outside a desired finite domain ( say , outside the domain , modelling an oscillating heart or rotating turbine ) . after solving , the first equation gives us the expression for @xmath66 .",
    "_ the equations of the first approximation _ of ( [ main - eq ] ) are @xmath67 the bar - part of the first equation is @xmath68 where the already known function @xmath69 is to be substituted from , . using the identity @xmath70 we transform into the final system of equations @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a modified pressure .",
    "one can see that the resulting form of the averaged equations coincides with the standard euler s equations containing an additional body force @xmath73 where the oscillatory pressure represents the solution of poisson s equation .",
    "this formula shows that for @xmath74 we have to consider body forces with @xmath75 .",
    "a simple example can be chosen as @xmath76 with new given functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the averaged force @xmath79 for this case can be calculated as @xmath80 where @xmath81 one can see that the force can be chosen as solenoidal with @xmath82 in this case @xmath83 due to the uniqueness of solution to laplace equation , which means @xmath84 and @xmath85 where the gradient term is included to the modified pressure .",
    "the expressions and can be further specified by the particular choice of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we can take @xmath88 , @xmath89 in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath90 , where @xmath91 represents an arbitrary smooth function . in this case",
    "gives @xmath92 and one can see that the oscillatory force with the only nonzero angular component produces a radially directed averaged force .",
    "the force @xmath63 could have some relations to applications .",
    "two terms are chosen in order to consider a rotating force . a simpler way of doing that is to consider three components of @xmath63 in cylindrical @xmath93 or spherical @xmath94 coordinates , where all the components are functions of the form @xmath95 or @xmath96 with an integer @xmath97 and the azimuthal angle @xmath98 .",
    "this research is partially supported by the grant ig / sci / doms/16/13 from sultan qaboos university , oman .",
    "a given force with non - zero average part can be routinely included into the above consideration . in this case",
    "one should take @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 in or an additional term @xmath101 in the right hand side of .",
    "it will only case the appearance of an additional term in as @xmath102    \\2 .",
    "viscosity can be included into consideration , however the form of resulting averaged equations will depend on the order of magnitude of reynolds number in terms of @xmath28 . in particular , if @xmath103 then the standard ` viscous ' term can be just added to the equation .",
    "we believe that the presented form of equations can be generalised , specified and used in such high - impact areas as turbo - machinery , medicine , biological fluid dynamics , _ etc .",
    "_ , where the use of various ` effective body forces ' represents one of actively used modelling approaches ."
