    "in this article , we provide a detailed theory for the temperature - dependent electronic compressibility ( @xmath1 ) of an interacting two dimensional ( 2d ) electron ( or hole ) system within the hartree - fock theory .",
    "we consider three distinct 2d systems of active current interest in condensed matter physics : 2d semiconductor systems ( e.g. , quantum wells , heterostructures , inversion layers , etc . ) ; monolayer graphene ; bilayer graphene .",
    "for the purpose of comparison ( and also for the sake of completeness ) , we also provide as an appendix the corresponding finite temperature hartree - fock compressibility for a standard three dimensional electron gas ( 3deg ) since this result does not appear to be available in the theoretical literature in spite of the sixty - year long history of studying many - body interaction effects in 3deg .    ever since the pioneering measurement of the 2d compressibility by eisenstein _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite it has been extensively studied in 2d systems because the compressibility provides fundamental insight into quantum ground state properties which are not readily obtained from transport measurements .",
    "some experimental studies @xcite of the compressibility have shed light on understanding the 2d metal - insulator transition ( mit)@xcite . the inverse compressibility ( @xmath2 ) is positive when the kinetic energy dominates over interactions at high densities . as the 2d density is reduced @xmath2 changes sign and becomes negative due to the increase of exchange energy associated with electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "the negative @xmath2 reaches a minimum value at a certain low density @xmath3 , and then increases dramatically with further decreasing @xmath3 as the 2d mit sets in . the minimum point in @xmath2",
    "has occasionally been loosely identified as the critical density for the 2d mit and is closely related to the transition from a homogeneous system to an inhomogeneous nonlinear screening regime , @xcite where the system is dominated by the formation of electron ( or hole ) puddles . whether this observed low - density behavior of @xmath1 is a cause for or an effect of 2d",
    "mit is unclear .",
    "the low - density compressibility of 2d electronic ( in this paper we use the term  electron \" to imply either electron or hole as should be obvious from the context ) systems has been of interest for almost 20 years now with the early experiments@xcite studying semiconductor - based 2d systems extensively and very recent experiments studying monolayer and bilayer graphene .",
    "the reason for the focus on the density dependence of compressibility is that , in general , quantum interaction effects increase monotonically with decreasing density in a coulomb system ( with monolayer graphene being an odd exception where the interaction parameter , the so - called graphene fine structure constant , is independent of carrier density@xcite ) , as discussed above , leading eventually to the electronic compressibility becoming negative at low , but easily accessible , densities due to exchange effects .",
    "it is curious , however , that in spite of this intense interest in the strongly interacting low - density 2d compressibility , there has been little research on the theoretical functional dependence of 2d compressibility on temperature .",
    "this is strange because the scale for the temperature dependence of any electronic property is the fermi temperature @xmath4 , which invariably decreases with decreasing density .",
    "thus , temperature effects on 2d compressibility become progressively more important _ even at a fixed temperature _ as the electron density goes down , since the important dimensionless temperature @xmath5 increases with decreasing density even if @xmath6 is kept fixed .",
    "for example ,",
    "2d gaas holes have @xmath7 k for a hole density of @xmath8 @xmath9 , which means that @xmath10 k is effectively a high - temperature regime for 2d hole densities @xmath11 @xmath9 !",
    "our work in this paper takes a first step in correcting this omission in the literature .",
    "our results are important for interpreting low - density 2d compressibility ( even at relatively low temperatures ) existing in the literature .",
    "the thermodynamic isothermal compressibility ( or simply compressibility ) of a system is defined as the change of pressure with volume , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the particle number , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath14 is the system volume , @xmath15 is the pressure , and @xmath16 is the total energy of the system .",
    "thus , @xmath17 . in the non - degenerate or classical systems the velocity of thermodynamic sound , @xmath18 , often provides a convenient experimental measure of compressibility , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass and the density of the system , respectively . in the quantum limit",
    "the compressibility can be obtained theoretically by using the theorem of seitz @xcite , ( i.e. , by connecting @xmath1 with the change in chemical potential with density , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the chemical potential and @xmath3 is the carrier density of the system ) .",
    "another method of evaluating @xmath1 is through the compressibility sum rule .",
    "this is an exact relationship between the compressibility and the long wavelength limit of the static dielectric function @xcite . in 2d quantum systems",
    "the compressibility is often measured from the quantum capacitance @xcite which is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "a scanning single electron transistor has also been used to directly measure the density dependent chemical potential @xcite , and hence @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "we will mostly discuss in this work the behavior of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the non - interacting compressibility , and @xmath29 .",
    "we note that sometimes @xmath26 is referred to as the thermodynamic density of states since at @xmath30 and for noninteracting system @xmath31 , the noninteracting density of states .    in this paper",
    ", we refer to @xmath1 and @xmath2 as compressibility and incompressibility ( i.e. inverse compressibility ) respectively , and also discuss results for @xmath32 , which is sometimes directly measured experimentally , remembering that this quantity is directly proportional to the incompressibility .",
    "a part of our theoretical motivation for exploring the temperature dependence of compressibility in 2d semiconductor systems arises from recent experiments conducted on gaas - based 2d systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , there has been substantial experimental interest in the temperature dependence of graphene compressibility.@xcite we find that the calculated temperature dependent compressibility including exchange energy is non - monotonic in temperature in both graphene and 2d semiconductor systems .",
    "however , their temperature behaviors appear to be reversed , i.e. , the inverse compressibility in graphene @xmath33 increases first with increasing temperature and then decreases at high temperatures while the inverse compressibility in 2d semiconductor systems decreases with temperature first and then increases at higher temperatures .",
    "we find that the leading order temperature correction to 2d @xmath2 within hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) is @xmath34 at low temperatures for both systems ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we also find that the blg compressibility has very weak temperature dependence because the non - interacting kinetic energy is independent of temperature .    to calculate the compressibility we use seitz s theorem which is given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the finite temperature chemical potential and @xmath3 the free carrier density .",
    "in general , the direct measurement of @xmath22 provides information on the thermodynamic many body renormalization ( for example , fermi velocity ) arising from electron - electron interaction effects@xcite .",
    "our goal here is to theoretically calculate the renormalized @xmath22 in graphene and 2deg including exchange interaction effects , or equivalently in the hfa , which should be an excellent quantitative approximation for compressibility in 2d systems .",
    "our calculated carrier density and temperature dependence of compressibility ( or @xmath37 ) can be directly compared to experimental measurements in 2d systems including graphene .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "when ever possible , we provide our results in dimensionless units for universal applicability .    in the absence of interaction , the non - interacting finite temperature chemical potential , @xmath38 , is calculated through the conservation of the total electron density , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the density of states with @xmath42 being a degeneracy factor including both spin and possible valley degeneracy , and @xmath43^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function .",

    "the inverse compressibility @xmath2 increases with temperature at low temperatures and decreases at high temperatures , reaching a maximum value at an intermediate temperature .",

    "our analytic results are in agreement with our numerical results both at low and at high temperatures .",
    "our use of the hartree - fock approximation is not a particularly restrictive approximation for the theory of the electronic compressibility since it is well - known that hartree - fock theory works well for the calculation of the compressibility and its density dependence , at least at @xmath30 .",

    "in fact , the hartree - fock approximation for 2d semiconductors is in better quantitative agreement with the density dependence of the measured compressibility@xcite than the corresponding rpa theory as long as the strict 2d approximation is used since the finite width corrections for the realistic 2d semiconductors tend to cancel out the correlation corrections neglected in the hfa . in any case",
    ", we consider the hfa as the first step necessary for understanding the temperature dependent 2d compressibility in interacting electron systems , and only future work , particularly experiments comparing with our predictions , can establish the necessity of improved theoretical treatments involving dynamical correlations neglected in the hfa .",
    "our main finding that the temperature dependence of compressibility is much stronger in 2d systems than in graphene is consistent with existing experimental results .",

    "[ sec : semi ] agree well with the experimental study of shapira _",

    "detailed quantitative comparison with the experimental data of shapira _",
    "et al.,_@xcite is not particularly meaningful ( and is not attempted ) because of a number of reasons including our use of the exchange - only hartree - fock approximation , our neglect of the finite thickness of the 2d semiconductor structures which is often important for quantitative considerations , our neglect of disorder effects which are certainly important at lower carrier densities , and the lack of information about some essential experimental parameters ( e.g. , depletion charge density ) .",
    "in addition to the experimental study of the temperature dependent 2d hole compressibility by shapira _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite discussed above , there have been several low - density studies of the temperature dependence of the compressibility in both electron and hole 2d systems@xcite carried out in the context of 2d mit ( i.e. , disorder - induced density - tuned localization of 2d semiconductor systems ) . as we discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : semi ] , these low - density experimental investigations should be revisited in light of our current work demonstrating the importance of the temperature dependence of @xmath27 in the low carrier density regime by virtue of the dimensionless temperature @xmath189 being large precisely in the low - density regime ( where disorder effects are also strong ) since @xmath137 in 2d systems .",
    "unfortunately , temperature , disorder , and interaction effects are all strong in the low density regime , making any quantitatively reliable theoretical work essentially impossible in the low carrier density regime , and our work establishes the importance of finite temperature effects on the compressibility in the low carrier density regime .",
    "in particular , the density inhomogeneity and puddle formation that happens at low carrier density @xcite due to the failure of screening would very much complicate the observation of the low - density ( and low - temperature ) features in the compressibility predicted in our theory unless one uses extremely high - quality samples with very low disorder .",
    "recently , there has been a theoretical investigation @xcite of the effect of disorder on low - density graphene compressibility clearly establishing the importance of disorder in low - density compressibility .",
    "since the fermi temperature @xmath175 goes as @xmath175(in k)@xmath350 ( 2d gaas electrons ) ; @xmath351 ( 2d gaas holes ) ; @xmath352 ( monolayer graphene ) ; @xmath353 ( bilayer graphene ) , where @xmath354 is the carrier density measured in the units of @xmath8 @xmath9 , it is obvious that the quantitative effect of finite temperature , even at low carrier densities , is by far the strongest ( weakest ) in 2d gaas holes ( monolayer graphene ) , which is consistent with experimental observations . since disorder effects become important for @xmath355 , where @xmath356 is the background random charged impurity density in the environment , the low density regime associated with large @xmath189 values becomes even more challenging to achieve in the laboratory experiments on graphene .",
    "we expect our predicted temperature dependence to manifest in graphene compressibility in room temperature experiments in very high - mobility samples where @xmath357 values may be achievable .",
    "an important relevant question for our theory is : what is the most suitable system for the experimental observation of our theoretical predictions ? obviously ,",
    "our predicted high - temperature behavior , where the theory is in very firm ground since the exchange energy is likely to be the exact leading - order many - body correction to the non - interacting compressibility in the high - temperature limit , should be valid for all systems and should be observable in 2d semiconductors ( both electrons and holes ) rather easily by measuring the compressibility for @xmath358 k for electron ( hole ) densities@xmath359 @xmath9 so that @xmath360 condition is satisfied .",
    "given that @xmath361 at the same density , the high - temperature behavior is much more easily observable in 2d gaas holes , and has , in fact , already been observed at least in one experimental study in 2d holes@xcite . while 2d gaas holes are the obvious ideal candidates for observing our predicted high - temperature compressibility behavior , monolayer graphene may turn out to be not particularly well - suited for the temperature - dependent compressibility studies because of its very high relative fermi - temperature ( @xmath362 k for a doping density of @xmath267 @xmath9 ) and its relatively weak temperature dependence . obviously , the condition for observing the high - temperature behavior of compressibility is the ability to reach @xmath363 which necessitates lower fermi temperatures .",
    "by contrast , the low-@xmath6 behavior associated with the @xmath0 term in the compressibility may be better observed in a system with a relatively high value of @xmath175 so that the regime @xmath364 can be explored over a fairly broad range of temperature with the temperature @xmath117 not being too low .",
    "thus , very high mobility n - gaas heterostructures or quantum wells with @xmath365 @xmath9 so that @xmath366 k ( and @xmath367 k ) may be the ideal system to search for our predicted shallow minimum in @xmath27 .",
    "one serious problem is that the minimum may be too shallow to be uniquely determined experimentally .",
    "finally , we discuss our very interesting analytical finding of the non - monotonicity in graphene inverse compressibility associated with the @xmath368 correction we obtain analytically ( and verify numerically ) .",
    "although this would not be an easy effect to detect experimentally because of its quantitative weakness ( and became the subleading correction goes as @xmath369 and thus the ratio of the two , @xmath370 , is always challenging to observe in experiments even under the best of circumstances ) , it is nevertheless interesting to discuss its origin and its robustness beyond our approximation scheme .",
    "our results are exact within the hartree - fock approximation scheme , and there is no doubt that the exchange self - energy contributes a @xmath0 leading - order contribution to the inverse compressibility .",
    "the first question is whether this is intrinsically a dimensionality effect occurring only in two dimensions .",
    "we have therefore carried out the corresponding analytical calculations for the 3d temperature - dependent compressibility ( presented in the appendix [ sec : appen ] of this paper ) , finding that @xmath27 has a @xmath0 contribution in three dimensions also .",
    "thus , it appears that the interesting non - monotonicity associated with the @xmath0 correction is a results of the hartree - fock approximation arising from the exchange self - energy diagram , and is not intrinsically a two - dimensional effect .",
    "we have investigated this question by calculating the interacting compressibility in the screened hartree - fock approximation ( sometimes also called static rpa ) for the 2d system , where the bare coulomb interaction ` @xmath14 ' appearing in the exchange self - energy is screened by the static rpa dielectric function .",
    "( these results are shown in appendix [ sec : appenb ] . )",
    "the screened hfa ( appendix [ sec : appenb ] ) or static rpa does not contain the @xmath0 term in the finite temperature inverse compressibility , but is not a reliable approximation at all since at @xmath30 it predicts that @xmath27 should be always positive for all values of @xmath70 in clear disagreement with experimental finding@xcite .",
    "thus the absence of the @xmath0 term in the screened hf approximation can not be taken seriously since the corresponding @xmath30 result is in qualitative disagreement with experimental results .",
    "it is interesting to speculate whether the @xmath0 term survives higher - order diagrams associated with dynamical correlation effects , and this remains a challenge for the future . although it is fairly straightforward to calculate the compressibility including correlation effects at @xmath30",
    " for example , the ring - diagram contributions to the compressibility can be exactly calculated at @xmath30 @xcite  it is a formidable challenge , both numerically and analytically , to extend to the corresponding ring diagram calculations of interacting compressibility to finite temperatures .",
    "we have studied this question carefully and have been able to show that there is definitely a @xmath369 term in @xmath27 arising from the infinite series of the ring diagrams , but we still do not know whether the @xmath0 term of the exchange self - energy is exactly canceled by the dynamical effects arising from the infinite ring diagram series . although the effect of the @xmath371 term matters only at low temperatures and low densities , where disorder effects dominate making it difficult to observe the log term experimentally , it is nevertheless important to establish whether this non - monotonicity associated with @xmath0 survives higher - order correlation terms in the theory .",
    "we leave this as an unanswered theoretical question for the future .",
    "a direct experimental observation of the @xmath0 term in the low - temperature inverse compressibility of 2d electrons or holes will go a long way in settling this important question .",
    "to summarize , our goal of this paper is to understand the temperature dependence of compressibility in a high density homogeneous system where the interaction effect is not too strong and hfa is valid . at very low density ,",
    "disorder effects are of particular importance and the system may be highly inhomogeneous due to the formation of electron - hole puddles@xcite , which are not included in our theory .",
    "our main result is that temperature effects in the compressibility could be quite important at higher temperatures .",
    "the work is supported by us - onr - muri and nri- nsf - swan .",
