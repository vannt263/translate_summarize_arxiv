    "the study of two dimensional ( 2d ) quantum many ",
    "body systems is a subject of considerable interest both from the theoretical and the experimental points of view .",
    "atomic helium monolayers have attracted much attention in these respects@xcite , and recently bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) in a strongly asymmetrical , quasi two  dimensional trap has been achieved@xcite . in a homogeneous 2d gas",
    "the one  body density matrix acquires a power law decay below some low critical temperature , @xmath2,@xcite and , at @xmath3=0 , its @xmath4 limit differs from zero .",
    "this behavior defines a true condensate and bec can occur in such a limit .",
    "the modified density of states in confined geometry , as it is the case for atoms in harmonic traps , makes bec appear even at finite temperature in 2d@xcite .    in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "referred as i hereafter , we have examined the structure of the ground state of a 3d homogeneous gas of bosons , interacting through both hard and soft core potentials .",
    "the study was carried out to enlighten the role of the interaction induced correlations along the density of the system and the possible occurrence of _ universality _ in the dependence of different properties on the gas parameter , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the particle density and @xmath7 the @xmath8wave scattering length ) . the calculations were performed within the correlated basis functions ( cbf ) theory , using optimized jastrow correlated wave functions@xcite .",
    "the results were in excellent agreement with the existing diffusion monte carlo@xcite ones , obtained by the _ exact _",
    "stochastic solution of the many ",
    "body schrdinger equation .",
    "moreover , the reliability ( and limitations ) of the analytical expansions in @xmath1 of the energy per particle and of the condensate fraction were clearly assessed @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the same variational approach to study the @xmath9 ground state of a homogeneous gas of @xmath10 hard  disks ( hd ) of radius @xmath7 .",
    "we pay particular attention to the long  range structure of the wave function , which is in turn intimately related to the long  range order of the density matrix and to the condensate fraction .    at present ,",
    "there are not published dmc results for these systems in the literature . however , based on the 3d case experience we believe that the variational approach may provide a very accurate description of the 2d ground state properties and serve as a test of validity for the available low density expansions ( lde )",
    ". this fact may be of relevance also to the study of bec in 2d harmonic traps , since lde are related to the gross  pitaevskii equation and its modification@xcite .",
    "lde for the energy per particle in terms of the 2d gas parameter , @xmath11 , have been derived by several authors , starting from the leading order@xcite : @xmath12 where the energy is in units of @xmath13 .",
    "an interesting question , that we do not address in this paper , is the insurgence and the degree of universality in 2d . in the 3d bose gas",
    "a dependence in the energy on the shape of the potential appears already at @xmath0@xcite , and breaks down earlier for quantities other than the energy , as the short range structure of the distribution function and the condensate fraction . a similar study for the 2d gas would be of great interest by itself and also in view of the analysis of the quasi 2d bec experiments in terms of the gross  pitaevskii equation .    in the case of strong interactions , as a hard  core potential , correlation effects are crucial . within cbf theory they are included by means of a many  body correlation operator , @xmath14 , acting on the non  interacting ground state wave function , @xmath15,@xcite : @xmath16 with @xmath17 for homogeneous bosons",
    ". @xmath18 may be determined according to the variational principle by minimizing the ground state energy .    in i",
    "a jastrow correlation operator was considered , @xmath19 where the two  body correlation function , @xmath20 , depends on the interparticle distance , @xmath21 , vanishes for @xmath22 and goes to unity at large distances .",
    "expectation values of operators on the jastrow correlated wave function correspond to multidimensional integrals ( we consider only operators dependent on the spatial coordinates ) which can be either directly evaluated by monte carlo type integrations ( variational monte carlo , vmc ) or expanded in cluster diagrams .",
    "the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) set of integral equations allows for summing an infinite number of diagrams , but it can be only approximately solved , since the class of the @xmath23 diagrams is not summable in a closed way@xcite .",
    "the approximation amounting to disregard the elementary diagrams ( hnc/0 ) is expected to be reliable in the low density regime , as shown in i.    in this paper we consider a system of @xmath24 spinless bosons of mass @xmath25 on a surface @xmath26 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a two - body , symmetric hard ",
    "disk potential , @xmath29 and the radius @xmath7 corresponds , for this potential , to the 2d scattering length .",
    "we consider the system in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath24 and @xmath30 , keeping the density , @xmath31 , constant ) .",
    "minimization of the energy with respect to @xmath32 provides the @xmath33 jastrow factor , which can be obtained through the solution of the euler ",
    "lagrange ( el ) equation@xcite , @xmath34 / \\delta f=0 $ ] .",
    "we adopt here the hnc/0 energy functional to solve the el equation .",
    "the resulting correlation , @xmath35 , shows a very long range structure ( @xmath36 , with @xmath37 constant ) not easily accessible to vmc , due to the limited size of the simulation box . as a consequence",
    "we have also used a parametrized shorter range correlation factor , suitable to be used in vmc and whose parameters are variationally fixed .",
    "the comparison between the hnc/0 and vmc calculations with this short range correlation provides a check of the accuracy of the truncation in the cluster expansion .",
    "diffusion monte carlo is also likely to suffer from the long range behavior of the wave function , as these fine structures , related to collective effects , are hardly distinguishable by numerical , finite size simulations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : the correlated variational theory and its implementation ( hnc and euler equations ) are briefly outlined in section ii ; an analysis of the el asymptotic behaviors is presented in section iii ; section iv presents the results for the hd model ; while summary and conclusions are given in section v.",

    "the function @xmath43 is an input to the hnc equations , which can be solved once a choice for it has been done .",
    "the simplest possible approximation corresponds to set @xmath44 ( hnc/0 ) .",
    "this apparently drastic truncation is , however , justified at low densities since the elementary diagrams , due to their high connectivity , do not appreciably contribute at the low densities relevant to bec experiments .",
    "otherwise , the energy and the rdf can be stochastically evaluated by monte carlo sampling of the corresponding many  body integrals ( [ rdf ] ) .",
    "the explicit calculation can be performed by using the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of monte carlo methods ) .",
    "connected to the rdf is the static structure function ( ssf ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 often used in the analysis of ( and extractable , within some approximations , from ) scattering experiments in condensed matter physics ( e.g. neutron scattering off liquid helium@xcite ) .",

    "again , setting @xmath54 these equations can be solved in the hnc/0 approximation .",
    "an appropriate choice of the correlation factor is essential for the effectiveness of the variational approach . as stated in the introduction ,",

    "the correlation function can then be obtained by inversion of the hnc equations .",
    "the el equations are solved both in configuration and momentum space , as discussed at length in i for the 3d hard  sphere case .",
    "the theory can be straightfordwardly applied to the 2d hard  disks gas and it is briefly outlined in the appendix .",
    "the correlation function produced by the solution of the el equation shows a long  range structure that is discussed in the next section .",
    "finite size monte carlo techniques have difficulties to correctly deal with this long range behavior and correlations healing to unity inside the simulation box are used . in this respect , we have also adopted a parametrized shorter  range correlation , @xmath56 , obtained by minimizing the energy computed at the two  body order of the cluster expansion , @xmath57 , constrained by a normalization condition @xmath58 = 0 \\label{min - heal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which requires the use of a lagrange multiplier @xmath59 .",

    ", it corresponds to a long range behavior , different , however , from the 3d case where @xmath73 and @xmath74 at large @xmath75values .",
    "in fact , the 2d fourier transform for a function , @xmath76 , with circular symmetry can be written as : @xmath77 while @xmath76 is obtained from @xmath78 as @xmath79    assuming that @xmath80 is a well behaved function at the origin , one finds @xmath81 where only the @xmath82 values of the function and of its even derivatives enter in the expansion .",

    "we remind that the hnc/0 approximation is used everywhere but in the vmc .",
    "the results of the @xmath1expansions previously discussed are also reported .",

    "finally , the condensate fractions lies well below the values predicted by the low density theories and also below the results for the three dimensional gas of hard spheres at the same gas parameter .",
