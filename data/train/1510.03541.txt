    "the following result is proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) by the way of carleman estimates .",
    "[ th-1 ] the linear system _ ( [ stokes ] ) _ is null - controllable at any time @xmath6 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ( numerical ) approximation of controls either distributed or located on the boundary for the stokes system has received much less attention , due to the underlying ill - posedness of the approximation . in practice ,",
    "such approximation is usually addressed in the framework of an optimal control reformulation .",
    "precisely , one seeks to minimize the quadratic functional @xmath32 over the non - empty set @xmath33 following @xcite , duality arguments allow to replace this constrained minimization by the unconstrained minimization of its conjugate function @xmath34 defined as @xmath35 over @xmath36 , where @xmath37 solves the adjoint backward stokes system associated with ( [ stokes ] ) : @xmath38    @xmath39 is the hilbert space defined as the completion of any smooth space functions included in @xmath40 for the norm @xmath41 . the control of minimal square - integrable norm is then given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is associated with the unique minimizer @xmath44 in @xmath39 of @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty , when one wants to approximate such control in any finite dimensional space , that is when one likes to minimize numerically @xmath34 , is that the space @xmath39 is huge , in particular , contains @xmath45 , and even elements that may not be distributions .",
    "numerical experiments do suggest that the minimizer @xmath44 is very singular ( we refer to @xcite for a detailed analysis in the close case of the heat equation ) .",
    "this phenomenon is independent of the choice of @xmath46 , but is related to the use of dual variables .",
    "actually , the equality ( [ null_condition ] ) can be viewed as an equality in a very small space ( due to the strong regularization effect of the heat kernel ) .",
    "accordingly , the associated multiplier @xmath47 belong to a large dual space , much larger than @xmath12 , that is hard to represent ( numerically ) in any finite dimensional space .",
    "an alternative way of looking at these problems and avoiding the introduction of dual variables has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following simple strategy .",
    "instead of working all the time with solutions of the underlying state equation , and looking for one that may comply with the final desired state , one considers a suitable class of functions complying with required initial , boundary , final conditions and appropriate regularity , and seeks one of those that is a solution of the state equation .",
    "this is in practice accomplished by setting up an error functional defined for all feasible functions , and measuring how far those are from being a solution of the underlying state equation .",
    "one advantage of this variational approach is that the way to get closer to a solution of the problem is by minimizing a functional that can not get stuck on local minima because the only critical points of the error turn out to be global minimizers with zero error .",
    "therefore a general strategy for approximation consists in using a descent algorithm for this error functional .",
    "this approach which has the flavor of a least - squares type method has been employed successfully in our null controllability context for the linear heat equation in @xcite and for an hyperbolic system in @xcite .",
    "we apply this approach to the stokes system . in section [ sec2 ] , we describe the ingredients of the variational approach for the system ( [ stokes ] ) and reduce the search of one controlled trajectory for the stokes system to the minimization of the quadratic functional @xmath48 defined by ( [ fonce ] ) over the affine space @xmath49 defined by ( [ spacea ] ) . in section [ sec3 ] , by a general - purpose lemma ( lemma [ basic ] ) , using the very specific structure of the functional @xmath48 , we prove that we may construct minimizing sequences for the error functional @xmath48 that do converge strongly to an extremal point for @xmath48 ( see proposition [ convergence ] ) .",

    "note also that @xmath49 is defined in agreement with the regularity of any solution @xmath27 of the stokes system with a source term @xmath54 .",
    "then , we define the functional @xmath55 by @xmath56 where the corrector @xmath57 is the unique solution in @xmath58 of the ( elliptic ) boundary value problem @xmath59 for any @xmath60 , the term @xmath61 belongs to @xmath62 so that the functional @xmath48 is well - defined in @xmath49 . the approach developed here is based on the following result .",

    "note that , without additional assumptions , the minimizer is not unique .",
    "conversely , we check that any minimizer for @xmath48 is a solution of the ( controlled ) stokes system : let @xmath66 be arbitrary where @xmath67 the first variation of @xmath48 at the point @xmath64 in the admissible direction @xmath68 defined by @xmath69 exists , and is given by @xmath70 where the corrector @xmath71 , associated with @xmath68 , is the unique solution of @xmath72 multiplying the main equation of this system by @xmath57 ( recall that @xmath57 is the corrector associated with the minimizer @xmath73 ) , integrating by parts , and using the boundary conditions on @xmath57 and @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 where we have used that @xmath76_0^t\\,d\\xvec = \\int\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int_{q_t } \\yvec\\cdot\\vvec_t\\,d\\xvec\\,dt,\\ ] ] and that @xmath77 therefore if @xmath64 minimizes @xmath48 , the equality @xmath78 for all @xmath66 implies that the corrector @xmath79 solution of ( [ corrector_unsteady ] ) satisfies the conditions @xmath80 but from the unique continuation property for the stokes system ( see @xcite ) , it turns out that @xmath81 in @xmath82 and that @xmath83 is a constant in @xmath82 . eventually , the relation ( [ eprime ] ) is then reduced to @xmath84 and then implies that this constant is zero . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath60 is a minimizer for @xmath48 , then @xmath85 in @xmath82 , and the corrector @xmath57 is zero in @xmath82 , so that @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 solves ( [ stokes ] ) , and since @xmath60 , the state @xmath20 is controlled at the time @xmath0 by the function @xmath87 which acts as a control distributed in @xmath18 .",
    "0.1 cm    the proof of proposition [ prop1 ] only utilizes optimality of @xmath64 and not its minimality .",

    "this is relevant from the perspective of the numerical simulation for it guarantees that the numerical procedure based on a descent strategy can not get stuck in local minima .",
    "0.1 cm    for any @xmath89 , the cost @xmath48 can be formulate as follows @xmath90 this justifies the least - squares terminology .",
    "the use of least - squares type approaches to solve linear and nonlinear problem is not new and we refer to @xcite for many applications .",
    "the use of least - squares type approaches in the controllability context comes from @xcite .",
    "0.1 cm    [ divepsilon ] the quasi - incompressibility case is obtained in the same way .",
    "it suffices to add @xmath91 ( for any @xmath92 ) to the divergence term in the functional @xmath48 .",
    "this is also in practice a classical trick to fix the constant of the pressure @xmath21 ( see section [ sec4 ] ) .",

    "it suffices to replace the function @xmath93 in ( [ stokes ] ) by any compact support function in time and space , say @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes a non - empty subset of @xmath82 .",
    "since theorem [ th-1 ] holds for any controllability time @xmath0 and any subset @xmath18 of @xmath10 , the controllability of ( [ stokes ] ) remains true as soon as @xmath95 contains any non - empty cylindrical domain of the form @xmath96 .",
    "0.1 cm    [ directproblem ] _ a fortiori _ , the approach is well - adapted to address the direct problem ( which consists , @xmath87 being fixed , in solving the boundary value problem ( [ stokes ] ) : it suffices to remove from @xmath49 and @xmath97 the condition ( [ null_condition ] ) , and fix the forcing term @xmath87 ( see @xcite using a similar least - squares type point of view ) . in that case , the second line of ( [ corrector_unsteady_control ] ) is replaced by @xmath98 , which implies with the first line , that @xmath57 and @xmath99 both vanish in @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth to notice that this approach allows to treat at the same time the null controllability constraint and the incompressibility one . in this sense",
    ", the pair @xmath100 can be regarded as a control function for the set of constraints @xmath101 these two conditions are compatibles : there is no competition between them . in the uncontrolled situation , from the uniqueness , the pressure @xmath21 is unique as soon as the source term ( here @xmath102 ) is fixed .",
    "on the other hand , in our controllability context , the pair @xmath103 is not unique : the pressure @xmath21 depends on @xmath104 and _ vice versa_. therefore , the optimization with respect to both variables at the same time makes sense . from this point of view",
    ", we may reformulate the problem as a general controllability problem for the heat equation : @xmath105 @xmath106 being a control function such that ( [ eq : contraint_gen ] ) holds .",
    "the control function @xmath106 acts on the whole domain , but on the other hand , should take the specific form @xmath107 . again , this perspective is different with the classical one , which consists in finding a control @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 in @xmath10 where @xmath27 solves ( [ stokes ] ) .",
    "this can done by duality , penalization technique , etc .",
    "conversely , one may also consider iteratively first the null controllability constraint , that is , for any @xmath21 fixed in @xmath110 , find a control @xmath111 such that ( [ null_condition ] ) holds , and then find the pressure @xmath21 such that @xmath112 holds in @xmath82 . using again a least - squares type approach ( for the heat equation , as developed in @xcite ) , the first step reduces to solve , for any @xmath113 fixed , the problem @xmath114 where @xmath115 solves ( [ corrector_unsteady ] ) and @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 the second step consists in updating the pressure according to a descent direction for the function @xmath118 defined by @xmath119 .",
    "we get that the first variation of @xmath120 at @xmath21 in the direction @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 solves @xmath124 again , this direct problem may be solved within the variational approach developed in this work ( see remark [ directproblem ] ) .",
    "proposition [ prop1 ] reduces the approximation of a null control for ( [ stokes ] ) to a minimization of the functional @xmath48 over @xmath49 . as a preliminary step ,",
    "since @xmath49 is not a vectorial space , we remark that any element of @xmath49 can be written as the sum of one element of @xmath49 , say @xmath125 , plus any element of the vectorial space @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we consider for any @xmath126 the following problem : @xmath127 problems ( [ extremal_pb ] ) and ( [ extremal_pb_bis ] ) are equivalent .",
    "any solution of problem ( [ extremal_pb_bis ] ) is a solution of the initial problem ( [ extremal_pb ] ) .",
    "conversely , any solution of problem ( [ extremal_pb ] ) can be decomposed as the sum @xmath128 , for some @xmath129 in @xmath97 .",
    "we endow the vectorial space @xmath97 with its natural norm @xmath130 such that : @xmath131 recalling that @xmath132 where @xmath133 solves @xmath134 in @xmath10 .",
    "we denote @xmath135 the corresponding scalar product .",
    "@xmath136 is an hilbert space .",
    "the relation ( [ eprime ] ) allows to define a minimizing sequence in @xmath97 for @xmath137 .",
    "it turns out that minimizing sequences for @xmath138 which belong to a precise subset of @xmath97 remain bounded uniformly .",
    "this very valuable property is not _ a priori _ guaranteed from the definition of @xmath138 .",
    "the boundedness of @xmath138 implies only the boundedness of the corrector @xmath57 for the @xmath139-norm and the boundedness of the divergence @xmath83 of the velocity field for the @xmath140-norm .",
    "actually , this property is due to the fact that the functional @xmath138 is invariant in the subset of @xmath97 which satisfies the state equations of ( [ stokes ] ) .    in order to construct a minimizing sequence bounded in @xmath97 for @xmath138 ,",
    "we introduce the linear continuous operator @xmath141 which maps a triplet @xmath142 into the corresponding vector @xmath143 , with the corrector @xmath57 as defined by ( [ corrector_unsteady ] ) .",
    "then we define the space @xmath144 composed of the elements @xmath64 satisfying the stokes system and such that @xmath20 vanishes on the boundary @xmath145 . note that @xmath146 is not the trivial space : it suffices to consider the difference of two distinct null controlled solutions of ( [ stokes ] ) . finally , we note @xmath147 the orthogonal complement of @xmath146 in @xmath97 and @xmath148 the ( orthogonal ) projection on @xmath149 .",
    "we then define the following minimizing sequence @xmath150 as follows : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is defined as the unique solution of the formulation @xmath153 @xmath154 denotes a positive descent step .",
    "in particular , ( [ fvdes ] ) implies that @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( actually in @xmath157 ) .",
    "one main issue of our variational approach is to establish the convergence of the minimizing sequence defined by ( [ minimizing_sequence ] ) .",
    "we have the following result .",
    "0.1 cm    [ convergence ] for any @xmath158 and any @xmath159 , the sequence @xmath160 converges strongly to a solution of the extremal problem ( [ extremal_pb ] ) .",
    "0.1 cm this proposition is the consequence of the following abstract result which can be adapted to many different situations where this variational perspective can be of help .",
    "0.1 cm    [ basic ] suppose @xmath161 is a linear , continuous operator between hilbert spaces , and @xmath162 , a closed subspace , @xmath163 .",
    "put @xmath164    1 .",
    "@xmath165 is quadratic , non - negative , and strictly convex , where @xmath166 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath146 in @xmath167 .",
    "if we regard @xmath48 as a functional defined on @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and identify @xmath167 with its dual , then the derivative @xmath169 always belongs to @xmath166 . in particular , a typical steepest descent procedure for @xmath168 will always stay in the manifold @xmath170 .",
    "3 .   if , in addition , @xmath171 , then the steepest descent scheme will always produce sequences converging ( strongly in @xmath172 ) to a unique ( in @xmath170 ) minimizer @xmath173 with zero error",
    ".    proof of lemma [ basic]- suppose there are @xmath174 , @xmath175 , such that @xmath176 due to the strict convexity of the norm in a hilbert space , we deduce that this equality can only occur if @xmath177 .",
    "so therefore @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "for the second part , note that for arbitrary @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and so @xmath182 therefore the derivative @xmath183 , the steepest descent direction for @xmath48 at @xmath184 , has to be orthogonal to all such @xmath180 .",
    "finally , assume @xmath185 .",
    "it is clear that this minimizer is unique in @xmath170 ( recall the strict convexity in ( i ) ) .",
    "this , in particular , implies that for arbitrary @xmath186 , @xmath187 because this inner product is the derivative of the section @xmath188 at @xmath189 , and this section must be a positive parabola with the minimum point at @xmath190 .",
    "if we consider the gradient flow @xmath191 then , because of ( [ desigualdad ] ) , @xmath192 this implies that sequences produced through a steepest descent method will be minimizing for @xmath48 , uniformly bounded in @xmath172 ( because @xmath193 is a non - increasing function of @xmath194 ) , and due to the strict convexity of @xmath48 restricted to @xmath170 , they will have to converge towards the unique minimizer @xmath173 . 0.1 cm    despite the strong convergence in this statement",
    ", it may not be true that the error is coercive , even restricted to @xmath170 , so that strong convergence could be very slow . because of this same reason , it may be impossible to establish rates of convergence for these minimizing sequences .",
    "0.1 cm the element @xmath195 determines the non - homogeneous data set of each problem : source term , boundary conditions , initial and/or final condition , etc .",
    "the subspace @xmath167 is the subset of the ambient hilbert space @xmath172 for which the data set vanishes .",
    "@xmath141 is the operator defining the corrector , so that @xmath196 is the subspace of all solutions of the underlying equation or system .",
    "the subspace @xmath146 is the subspace of all solutions of the problem with vanishing data set .",
    "in some situations @xmath146 will be trivial , but in some others will not be so .",
    "the important property is ( iii ) in the statement guaranteeing that we indeed have strong convergence in @xmath172 of iterates .",
    "the main requirement for this to hold is to know , _ a priori _ , that the error attains its minimum value zero somewhere , which in the situation treated here is guaranteed by theorem [ th-1 ]",
    ". 0.1 cm proof of proposition [ convergence]- the result is obtained by applying lemma [ basic ] as follows .",
    "if we put @xmath197 @xmath172 is taken to be @xmath198 .",
    "@xmath167 is taken to be @xmath97 as given in ( [ spacea0 ] ) and @xmath199 .",
    "the operator @xmath141 maps a triplet @xmath200 into @xmath201 as explained earlier .",
    "the construction of the minimizing sequence only requires the resolution of standard well - posed elliptic problems over @xmath82 , well - adapted to general situations ( time dependent support , mesh adaptation , etc ) . on the other hand , it is important to highlight that the @xmath202 control function @xmath87 obtained from the minimizing procedure does not _ a priori _ minimize any specific norm ( for instance the @xmath203-norm ) .    without the projection on @xmath204 in ( [ minimizing_sequence ] ) , the sequence @xmath205 remains a minimizing sequence for @xmath206 : actually , the values of the cost @xmath138 along the sequence @xmath205 are equal with or without the projection .",
    "this is due to the fact that the component of the descent direction @xmath207 on @xmath208 does not affect the value of the cost : on the other hand , without the projection , the minimizing sequence may not be bounded uniformly in @xmath97 , in particular the control function @xmath87 may not be bounded in @xmath202 .",
    "the subset @xmath166 is not explicit , so that in practice the projection @xmath209 may be defined by @xmath210 , where @xmath211 solves the extremal problem : @xmath212 recalling that @xmath146 is by definition the set of triplets @xmath64 satisfying @xmath213 , @xmath99 in @xmath82 such that @xmath20 vanishes on @xmath145 , this extremal problem is nothing else than a controllability problem for the stokes system , similar to the one considered in this work .",
    "therefore , we shall bypass this projection and shall introduce instead a stopping criteria for the descent method measuring how far from @xmath149 the descent direction is .",
    "we refer to @xcite for numerical experiments .",
    "the least - squares approach allows to address non - linear problem .",
    "we consider here simply the steady navier - stokes and address the direct problem : find @xmath27 solution of @xmath214 we recall the following result ( see @xcite ) :      in order to solve this boundary value problem , we use a least - squares type approach .",
    "we consider the space @xmath218 and then we define the functional @xmath55 by @xmath219 where the corrector @xmath57 is the unique solution in @xmath220 of the ( elliptic ) boundary value problem @xmath221              from theorem [ th - temam ] , the infimum is equal to zero and is reached by an element solution of ( [ navierstokes ] ) .",
    "conversely , we would like to state that the only critical point for @xmath48 correspond to solution of ( [ navierstokes ] ) .",
    "we then check that we can take @xmath235 , i.e. @xmath236 uniquely given by the solution of ( [ corrector_unsteadyqua ] ) remains bounded with respect to @xmath237 . by definition , the corrector @xmath57 solves the variational formulation : @xmath238 taking @xmath239 , we get that @xmath240 so that , in view of the poincar inequality , @xmath241 leading to the result",
