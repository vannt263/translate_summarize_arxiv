    "transitional disks have properties that can be interpreted as intermediate between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases , with an optically thick outer disk and typically a wide ( tens of au ) gap within ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possible origin for such gaps is dynamical clearing by forming planets .",
    "the transitional disk host lkca  15 has emerged as a benchmark target for this scenario .",
    "lkca  15 is a k5-type star at a distance of @xmath0140pc located in the taurus - auriga star - forming region @xcite .",
    "resolved imaging ranging from the visible to millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirmed the morphological structure implied from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting @xcite , all showing an outer disk truncated inward of @xmath050  au .",
    "recent scattered light imaging also revealed an inner disk component within the gap structure @xcite .",
    "lkca  15 stands out in that directly imaged planet candidates have been reported in the system .",
    "the first candidate was published by @xcite , and subsequently two more were proposed by @xcite .",
    "we follow the three - object nomenclature of @xcite , in which ` b ' refers to a candidate at @xmath014.7  au which displays h@xmath3 emission , with ` c ' and ` d ' following counterclockwise .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission of ` b ' makes a particularly compelling case for a protoplanet , as it implies active gas accretion . here",
    "we present new deep , high - contrast images of lkca  15 with sphere ( spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research ; @xcite ) , offering the first full map of the gap s outer edge and revealing the inner disk structures hinted at by earlier studies .",
    "these images also serve to complement the observations in which the planet candidates were discovered , where the precise morphology of the emission can not be uniquely determined ( with the exception of the h@xmath3 imaging ) , since they are based on sparse - aperture masking ( sam ) and thus do not fully sample the pupil plane of the telescope .",
    "on 2015 - 12 - 19 , we obtained two sets of imaging polarimetry data with the irdis branch @xcite of sphere at the european southern observatory s very large telescope .",
    "the extreme adaptive optics ( saxo ; @xcite ) yielded a point - spread function ( psf ) with a fwhm of @xmath04 pixels ( @xmath4mas ) in the broadband @xmath1 filter ( ` bb_j ` , 1.26@xmath5 m ) under good conditions ( seeing 0608 in @xmath6-band ) .    the first observation , hereafter named deep , aimed at maximizing sensitivity for the faint disk structures and therefore employed the ` n_alc_yj_s ` coronagraph ( apodized lyot , inner working angle 80mas ) with long exposures ( 32s ) .",
    "the observation comprised 15 polarimetric cycles of 2 exposures at each of the 4 standard half - wave plate positions for a total of 3840s of exposure .",
    "the second observation , fast , was executed immediately afterwards without coronagraph and with minimal exposure times ( 0.85s ) to leave the star unsaturated and grant access to the innermost regions .",
    "three polarimetric cycles with 40 exposures per position yielded 102s of exposure .",
    "frame registration was performed on fast by fitting two - dimensional gaussians to the unsaturated target star in each frame . since those measured star locations appeared stable ( jitter @xmath02mas ) with no visible drift",
    ", we adopted their median star location for all deep frames . apart",
    "from removing the coronagraph , no changes were made to the instrument setup between deep and fast runs .",
    "the data were reduced using custom ` idl ` routines implementing the double - ratio polarimetry and empirical correction of instrumental and stellar polarization from @xcite .",
    "we present the results as polar - coordinate stokes components ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , in which positive @xmath7 signals correspond to azimuthally oriented linear polarization @xcite . in face - on or",
    "mildly inclined circumstellar disks , this convention maps almost all scattered light into positive @xmath7 signal .",
    "however , due to lkca  15 s inclination of 50@xmath9 @xcite , multiple - scattering events also produce faint @xmath8 signals @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 therefore provides an upper limit for the noise level .",
    "furthermore , on 2015 - 11 - 29 , we obtained non - polarimetric imaging , hereafter named full , with sphere irdis in dual - band imaging mode ( dbi ; @xcite ) with the ` k1k2 ` filter ( @xmath10 @xmath11 m , @xmath12 @xmath11 m ) as part of the sphere infrared survey for exoplanets ( shine ; chauvin et al .",
    "2016 in prep ) .",
    "pupil tracking was used to allow for angular differential imaging ( adi , @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained a sequence of 4288s totalling a field rotation of 24.5@xmath9 , using the ` n_alc_yjh_s ` coronagraph ( apodized lyot , inner working angle 93mas ) .",
    "non - coronagraphic frames were obtained before and after the coronagraphic sequence for photometric calibration .",
    "all data were reduced with the sphere pipeline @xcite and additional analysis tools implemented at the sphere data centre , including adi with ` klip ` ( 5 subtracted modes , 24.5@xmath9 field rotation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since these observations are less sensitive to planets than previous studies , we only use them to complement our disk analysis ( see section  [ s : outer ] ) .",
    "our @xmath1-band polarimetry of lkca  15 is shown in figure  [ f : images ] .",
    "the deep @xmath7 images ( fig .  [ f : images]a ) reveal the inner and outer disk components and the gap between them at much higher s / n than previously achieved @xcite . to quantify the detection , we calculate s / n maps ( fig .",
    "[ f : images]b ) by dividing the @xmath7 and @xmath8 images by a radial noise profile obtained by calculating the standard deviation of pixel values in concentric annuli in the @xmath8 image .",
    "both disk components are detected at high significance in @xmath7 , with local s / n exceeding 5@xmath13 over an area of 0.23arcsec@xmath14 and peaking at 11@xmath13 . finally , we present the @xmath7 and @xmath8 images after scaling with an @xmath15 map , where @xmath16 represents the estimated physical distance of each pixel s scattering material from the star , assuming it lies on the disk s inclined midplane ( 50@xmath9 ; fig .  [",
    "f : images]c ) .",
    "this counteracts the @xmath17 dependency of the scattered - light intensity and thus reduces the dynamic range of the image , rendering disk components at different separations directly comparable .",
    "this reveals the inner edge of the outer disk as a sharp intensity step ( @xmath060% over 1fwhm , cf .",
    "section  [ s : profiles ] ) in @xmath7 , allowing us to trace the edge at all position angles for the first time .",
    "the residuals in the @xmath8 image appear as a faint quadrupole pattern diagonal to the principal axes of the projected disk , as expected from higher - order scattering @xcite .",
    "the brightest structures in @xmath15-scaled @xmath8 are @xmath04 times fainter than those in @xmath15-scaled @xmath7 .    figures  [ f : images]d  f show the same images for fast . despite the lower sensitivity ,",
    "the same structures as in deep can be discerned .",
    "the calculated s / n drops sharply within a radius of @xmath080mas , though this could be due to astrophysical signal from higher - order scattering dominating the @xmath8 image at those separations , causing the noise to be overestimated . for",
    "now , we assume that fast does not detect the disk at smaller separations than deep",
    ". however , the disk structures appear notably sharper in fast .",
    "this may be due to the fact that those were registered on a frame - to - frame basis , whereas the long exposure times and global registration of deep may have introduced some smearing .                whereas the imagery in @xcite and @xcite sufficed to discover and confirm the presence of scattered light from the inner disk , our new data now allow us to investigate its morphology .",
    "figure  [ f : inner ] shows a comparison of the inner regions of the @xmath15-scaled @xmath7 images from deep ( panel a ) and fast ( b , c ) as well as our previously published @xmath2-band data ( d ; @xcite ) .",
    "all three images show the inner disk in strikingly similar morphology . the polarized flux is contained in a roughly elliptical area comparable in shape and orientation to the outer disk , but about half as large in each dimension .",
    "we note a number of morphological features that appear persistent between the three images , as marked in figure  [ f : inner]c : a bright crescent on the near side of the disk , reminiscent of the full - intensity scattered - light appearance of the outer disk @xcite ; a slight asymmetry between the two crescent arms , with the western arm ( ` x ' ) seemingly trending outward while the eastern arm ( ` y ' ) curls inward ; and a local brightening along the far side of the minor axis ( ` z ' ) .",
    "furthermore , the area within this crescent appears darkened , giving the impression of another gap in the inner disk .",
    "however , we caution that polarimetric efficiency drops in the innermost resolution elements , where the positive / negative pattern in @xmath18 and @xmath19 is too small to be cleanly resolved @xcite .",
    "this could mimic a gap .",
    "figure  [ f : inner]c also indicates the positions of the three proposed planet candidates (  b  ,  c  ,  d  ; cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* lbt joint fit results ) , which coincide with the bright , forward - scattering side of the inner disk .",
    "the analysis and interpretation of sam data is challenging and potentially even misleading in the presence of scattered light from a disk ( e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , caceres et al .  in prep . ) ; thus , the inner disk might account for some or even all of the sam signal attributed to protoplanets .",
    "on the other hand , h@xmath3 imaging makes a strong case for a protoplanet at ` b ' , which could be confirmed with a re - detection in h@xmath3 showing orbital motion .",
    "such a protoplanet could be responsible for the substructure in the inner disk .",
    "in the @xmath15-scaled @xmath7 images , the outer disk appears as a diffuse region of roughly flat brightness bounded on the inside by a sharp elliptical edge .",
    "we employ the maximum merit method @xcite to fit a parametric ellipse onto the deep @xmath7 image that maximizes the brightness contrast between the annular regions immediately inside and outside of the ellipse , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "we fix the position angle of the major axis to 60@xmath9 ( cf.@xcite ) . the resulting ellipse is shown in solid blue in figure  [ f : ellipses]a",
    ". the fit ellipse matches the perceived gap edge accurately .    to separate the inner and outer disk for further analysis",
    ", we also fit a second ellipse along which the @xmath15-scaled @xmath7 intensity is minimized .",
    "this ellipse is shown in dotted blue in figure  [ f : ellipses]a .",
    "the numerical parameter of both ellipses are given in table  [ t : num ] .",
    "for errors , we `` fit '' similar ellipses to @xmath8 and measure the standard deviation of the resulting merits .",
    "the error intervals represent the family of ellipses whose @xmath7 merits are less than one standard deviation below the best fit .",
    "figure  [ f : ellipses]b compares the gap edge fit ellipses in @xmath1-band polarimetry ( this work ; solid blue ) to those in @xmath2-band polarimetry ( @xcite ; long - dashed red ) and sub - millimeter interferometry ( @xcite ; short - dashed green ) with respect to the star s position .",
    "our new data confirm the eccentric scattered - light gap contrasting with the symmetric gap in sub - millimeter thermal emission . due to the tapered gap wall",
    ", inclination can not explain this eccentricity @xcite , whereas shadowing from the inner disk could @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity appears slightly lower than in @xmath2-band .",
    "this could be due to the poorly constrained far - side edge in the @xmath2-band data , color - dependent polarized reflectivity , chromatic filtering by the inner disk halo , or a temporal evolution of the shadowing postulated as the origin of the eccentric scattered - light gap .",
    "figure  [ f : ellipses]c shows the @xmath1-band gap ellipse superimposed on the @xmath20-band full - intensity klip image of the full data .",
    "the ellipse coincides exactly with the sharp inner edge of the bright forward - scattering crescent , confirming the long - held assumption that such crescents in adi images accurately trace the near - side gap edge even though the fainter parts of the disk suffer from oversubtraction effects .",
    "the deep data are sensitive enough to search for substructure in the outer disk .",
    "while we find no sign of spirals or structural asymmetries , we note significant variations in the azimuthal @xmath7 distribution .",
    "in particular , the disk appears locally dimmed in radial lanes around azimuths 50@xmath9 , 135@xmath9 , 200@xmath9 , and 325@xmath9 ( see figure  [ f : ellipses]d , e ) .",

    "the four position angles from panel ( d ) are indicated with vertical dashes .",
    "the @xmath8 profile is dominated by the multiple - scattering quadrupole . ]",
    "one possible scenario is that these dark lanes indicate shadows cast by inner disk regions @xcite or magnetospheric accretion columns @xcite .",
    "the inner and outer disks do have similar azimuthal structure .",
    "an alternative explanation is that a polarized scattering phase function with peaks in both the forward and backward directions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could brighten the projected disk along its minor axis ( stolker et al . in prep . ) .",
    "a case study for this scenario is hd100546 @xcite , where a bright wedge surrounded by two dark wedges was detected along the near - side minor axis .",
    "another analogy between these two datasets is the presence of a tenuous counterpart to the bright wedge in @xmath8 , which is roughly 45@xmath9 displaced from it .",
    "this detection may suggest small departures from centrosymmetric scattering as expected from multiple scattering in inclined disks @xcite .      to quantify the amount of polarized light detected ,",
    "we calculate surface brightness profiles in the @xmath7 image without @xmath15 scaling .",
    "we extract a 86mas wide strip along the major axis of the projected disk ( position angle 60@xmath9 ; @xcite ) and a 257mas wide strip along the minor axis , and average the pixel values across the width to obtain one - dimensional profiles .",
    "we then divide each profile by the sum of all pixel values in the unsaturated stellar full - intensity psf ( out to 123 ) and by the solid angle on sky corresponding to a pixel ( 00123@xmath14 ) .",
    "the values of the resulting profiles therefore measure the local polarized flux density of the disk in units of stellar flux per square arcsecond .",
    "the resulting values do not explicitly depend on pixel size or wavelength and therefore allow for direct comparison between optical and infrared measurements .",
    "( this differs from the normalization used in @xcite . )",
    "figures  [ f : profiles]a and b show the profiles for the major and minor axis , respectively .",
    "the solid black curve corresponds to deep . to visualize the uncertainty level ,",
    "we extract a number of equivalent profiles from the deep @xmath8 image and add them to the measured @xmath7 profiles , yielding the family of grey curves .",
    "the thin orange curves are the @xmath7 profiles for fast , which match the deep results well .",
    "we also show the corresponding @xmath7 profiles for the @xmath2-band data from @xcite as thin red curves .",
    "while the morphology of the @xmath2- and @xmath1-band profiles is similar , the latter is significantly brighter overall .",
    "we investigate this effect by summing the @xmath7 image over the detectable parts of the inner and outer disks in each filter .",
    "we sample the inner disk from a radius of 70mas out to the flux - minimum fit ellipse ( dotted blue in fig .",
    "[ f : ellipses]a ) , and the outer disk from that ellipse out to a radius of 1225 .",
    "we find that the polarized disk flux to stellar flux ratio is 6.4 times larger in @xmath1 than in @xmath2 for the inner disk , and 6.6 times for the outer disk .",
    "the polarized flux ratio between the inner and outer disk area appears stable with wavelength ( 0.70 in @xmath1 , 0.73 in @xmath2 ) .",
    "judging from the @xmath8 images , these figures are accurate on the order of 10% .",
