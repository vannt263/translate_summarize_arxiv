    "@xcite to obtain wider pbg it is desirable to increase the refractive index , different authors have reported that the width of the band gap is a function of the contrast index , the larger the better .",

    "our formula to determine the submirror periods is based on a clear physical insight related to the addition of the photonic band gaps , while it is not clear the reason why the empirical rule proposed refs .",

    "stacking together different substructures the band gap of the heterostructure is the union of the band gap of the submirrors . for this reason ,",
    "each submirror has been chosen so that the band gaps can be added .",
    "we have presented the design of a mirror for the near infrared range .",

    "the proposed porous silicon based photonic heterostructure has been designed using parameters of refractive indices and periods that are compatible with the well established porous silicon technology .",
    "these structures have an excellent potential for integration with optoelectronic technology .",
    "this is relevant because one of the goals of silicon based fabrication techniques is to integrate infrared or optical components such as modulators , photodetectors or sensors in porous silicon ships to fabricate new photonic devices .",
