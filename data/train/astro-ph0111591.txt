    "in the currently standard interpretation of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the central engine gives rise to a highly relativistic outflow , the ` fireball ' .",
    "although the presence of relativistic outflows in grbs has been amply demonstrated by multiwavelength observations of afterglows ( piran 1999 , van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers 2000 , mszros 2001 ) , the nature of the central engine itself is still a great mystery .",
    "one model of the central engine that has recently gained attention is the ` supranova ' model of vietri & stella ( 1998 , hereafter vs98 ) , in which a massive star ends up in a supernova ( sn ) , but the subsequent black hole formation and grb event is delayed by some time @xmath2 , typically expected to be a few months to years .",
    "the sn is assumed to leave behind a rotationally - supported , ` supramassive ' neutron star ( smns ; hereafter also referred to simply as ` pulsar ' ) which then slowly shrinks by shedding angular momentum via a magnetospheric wind ( and/or gravitational radiation ; see  [ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "after a spin - down time @xmath2 when roughly half its initial angular momentum has been lost , the configuration becomes unstable and collapses to a black hole , possibly with a surrounding disk , leading to the grb proper .",
    "the model s major advantage lies in the potential realization of a very baryon - clean pre - grb environment ( mandatory for generating sufficiently relativistic fireballs ) : first the sn ejects the majority of the outlying mass of the progenitor star , and second the smns driven - wind effectively sweeps up remaining baryonic matter in the vicinity of the central object .",
    "support for this model comes from recent detections of strong fe emission features in the x - ray afterglow spectra of some grbs ( piro et al .",
    "1999 , antonelli et al .",
    "2001 , yoshida et al .",
    "2001 ) , particularly that of grb991216 ( piro et al . 2000 ) , as well as a transient fe absorption feature in the prompt emission of grb990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ) , indicating surprisingly large amounts of fe - rich material existing nearby , yet relatively removed from the grb site .",
    "observational constraints on its location , quantity , density and velocity are compatible with the pre - ejected shell sn remnant ( snr ) in the supranova model ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 , vietri et al .",
    "2001 , lazzati et al .",
    "2001 ) , but may be difficult to accomodate in other models ( see however rees & mszros 2000 , mszros & rees 2001 , bttcher & fryer 2001 , mclaughlin et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the precursor pulsar wind should be extremely powerful . before collapsing ,",
    "the smns must inevitably expel a substantial fraction of its rotational energy @xmath3 as a magnetically - driven wind , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the smns s mass and angular velocity , @xmath7 is its angular momentum in units of @xmath8 , and the numbers are typical smns model values ( salgado et al .",
    "1994 , cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 , vs98 ) .",
    "the spin - down time ( i.e. the sn - grb delay time ) and corresponding wind luminosity can be estimated from the magnetic dipole formula ( pacini 1967 , vs98 ) @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a typical smns equatorial radius .",
    "the surface magnetic field @xmath12 is unconstrained from model calculations and can be considered a free parameter .",
    "equivalently , we may take @xmath2 as the free parameter , and vary @xmath13 accordingly with @xmath3 fixed as in eq.[eqn : ep ] ; the fiducial value we choose below is @xmath14 ( implying @xmath15 ) so as to be consistent with observations of grb991216 ( see  [ sec : aftenv ] ) . during @xmath2 , @xmath16",
    "is expected to be relatively constant , and the wind should energize a plerionic nebula in the pre - grb surroundings , a more compact yet much more luminous version of the crab nebula .",
    "the consequences of such a precursor plerion in the supranova scenario has not been considered previously , and this paper addresses some important dynamical and radiative effects it may induce , each providing important observational diagnostics for the supranova model .",
    "we discuss the acceleration and fragmentation of the sn ejecta material by the plerion - snr interaction and its implications for fe line emission in ",
    "[ sec : snr ] , and inverse compton scattering of the ambient plerion radiation field in the grb external shock and the resulting high - energy afterglow emission in  [ sec : ec ] .",
    "a brief consideration of the direct detection and identification of the precursor plerion emission is given in ",
    "[ sec : dir ] .",
    "we will assume a flat lambda cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "after this paper was submitted , we became aware of the work of knigl and granot ( 2002 , hereafter kg02 ) , who also investigated the properties of grb afterglows occurring inside plerionic nebulae in the context of the supranova model .",
    "they stressed the advantages of such a picture in realizing the relatively high magnetic fields and electron injection efficiencies required in the grb blastwave to explain observed afterglows , and demonstrated this by constructing magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) models for the plerion under various assumptions .",
    "here we are interested in some characteristic observable effects caused by the precursor plerionic activity which are peculiar to the supranova model and through which the model may be tested by future observations",
    ". the emphasis of this paper will be on the relevant radiative processes and their observational implications ; we choose to keep the discussion of the plerion dynamics relatively simple and leave more detailed modeling of this aspect to future studies .",
    "a study following our approach but with a more realistic treatment of the plerion has recently been carried out by guetta & granot ( 2002 ) .",
    "an exemplary case of the dynamical interaction between a plerion and a snr can be seen in the well - studied crab nebula , which is known to be accelerating and fragmenting the surrounding snr , resulting in the prominent optical filaments instead of a clear shell ( e.g. davidson & fesen 1985 , hester et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this respect",
    ", the powerful supranova plerion can be even more effective than the crab .",
    "we model the plerion in a simple way following pacini & salvati ( 1973 , hereafter ps73 ; see also bandiera , pacini & salvati 1984 , chevalier & reynolds 1984 , chevalier 2000 ) , considering a homogeneous , spherical bubble into which energy is injected at a constant rate @xmath20 , a fraction @xmath21 going into magnetic field and the rest @xmath22 into relativistic electrons .",
    "the electrons here are mostly radiative ( see  [ sec : ec ] ) , and we neglect their pressure for simplicity . as the plerionic bubble initially plows through the expanding core and envelope of the progenitor star , it should accelerate the swept - up ejecta material ( chevalier 1977 , chevalier & fransson 1992 , kg02 ) .",
    "if a fair fraction of the total plerion energy @xmath23 can be conveyed to sn ejecta of several @xmath24 , their final attained velocities could reach @xmath25 , consistent with those inferred from the observed width of the fe line in grb991216 ( piro et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as in the crab ,",
    "the sn ejecta should not entirely remain as a spherical shell during this acceleration phase due to rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities operating at the plerion - snr interface .",
    "the growth timescale of the rt instability on a spatial scale @xmath26 is @xmath27 , and since @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the plerion magnetic pressure , its ratio to the expansion timescale @xmath30 is @xmath31 ( bandiera , pacini & salvati 1983 ) , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the snr ejecta mass , velocity and kinetic energy , and @xmath35 is time after the sn in units of 10 days . in the case of the crab , @xmath36 and the rt instability is currently setting in , consistent with other lines of evidence ( hester et al .",
    "1996 , sankrit & hester 1997 ) .",
    "however , it can potentially develop much more rapidly for the supranova plerion .",
    "the final outcome of the rt instability is not easy to predict , as it will depend on the instability s non - linear behavior as well as other processes such as radiative cooling and thermal conduction .",
    "we refer to the work of jun ( 1998 ) as a guideline , who carried out 2-dimensional numerical simulations of the plerion - snr interaction and associated rt instabilities , choosing crab - like parameters for @xmath16 and @xmath37 and neglecting cooling .",
    "his results demonstrate that the rt instability leads to dramatic effects at late times , strongly disrupting the snr shell and transforming it into pronounced rt `` fingers '' which carry the majority of the sn ejecta mass and kinetic energy . to be identified with the crab s optical filaments ,",
    "these fingers protrude inward from the outer ejecta shell and end in dense `` heads '' with slower expansion velocities than the plerion , which can eventually become decoupled from the shell . in jun s simulations ,",
    "the density of the heads was on average @xmath38 times that of the rest of the sn ejecta , and the radial extent of the fingers was @xmath39 times that of the shell radius .",
    "however , as mentioned in his discussion , the inclusion of radiative cooling should increase the density contrast of the heads , and both this and the radial extent of the fingers should grow with time .",
    "these quantities could then be much larger for the supranova plerion , since the relative timescale of the instability here might be much shorter ( eq.[eqn : trt ] ) .",
    "although a firm conclusion warrants high resolution simulations of the relevant conditions , it is not implausible that the plerion can effectively shred a substantinal portion of the sn ejecta into condensed fragments and engulf them during its lifetime @xmath2 .",
    "note that arons ( 2002 ) , in a somewhat different context , has recently discussed the issue of snr fragmentation by a powerful pulsar wind in greater depth .",
    "if this is indeed the case ( see  5 for comments when this is not ) , there are important implications for the fe line emission in afterglows .",
    "the simplest explanation for the lines is fe k@xmath40 multiple recombination radiation from fe - rich matter photoionized by the x - ray afterglow continuum on timescales of days ( lazzati et al . 1999 ,",
    "weth et al .",
    "2000 , paerels et al . 2000 ) .",
    "consistency with observations require that the material to be illuminated is very dense and possesses a large covering factor , and yet that the grb line of sight is devoid of any such matter so that the grb blastwave will not be decelerated too quickly ( lazzati et al .",
    "the filamentary fragmentation of the snr may naturally account for such a geometry .",
    "the condensation of the snr matter may also enhance the line emissivity .",
    "the emission rate of line photons through recombination when a sufficient photoionizing flux irradiates material with electron density @xmath41 and temperature @xmath42 containing an fe mass @xmath43 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total number of fe atoms and @xmath46 is the recombination time for h - like fe ( paerels et al . 2000 ,",
    "vietri et al . 2001 ) .",
    "by the time of the grb at @xmath47 ( see  [ sec : ec ] ) , a snr of @xmath48 expanding at @xmath49 will have reached a radius @xmath50 , and if distributed in a spherical shell of width @xmath51 , its electron density would be @xmath52 typically observed line fluxes can be obtained for @xmath53 ( eq.[eqn : nl ] ) , but only if the entire spherical shell is irradiated and emits line photons efficiently .",
    "the grb blast wave must then be isotropic and no beaming is allowed ( piro et al .",
    "2000 ; see however kg02 ) , which is incongruous with recent evidence to the contrary ( e.g. frail et al .",
    "2001 , panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) . however , if the snr ejecta can be condensed into filaments of much higher density , @xmath54 is shortened , and irradiating a smaller fraction of material may suffice to produce the observed lines . for comparison , the density of the the crab s optical filaments averaged over the volume of the whole nebula is @xmath55 , whereas the actual density of the individual filaments is @xmath56 ( davidson & fesen 1985 ) .",
    "although detailed numerical modeling is necessary for quantitative predictions , we may speculate that the density contrast could be even higher for the supranova plerion due to the instability being more developed ( see above ) , and beaming fractions of order @xmath57 may be entirely compatible with the observed fe lines .",
    "note that in explaining the transient fe absorption feature in grb990705 , lazzati et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have inferred the presence of clumpy snr ejecta material with density contrasts of order 100 - 1000 surrounding the burst site ( see also bttcher , dermer & fryer 2002 ) .",
    "the observed line energy in grb991216 can also be consistent with beaming if identified with blueshifted emission from he - like fe ( for which the rest frame energy is 6.7 kev , and @xmath54 is similar to h - like fe at somewhat lower @xmath58 ) in material approaching toward the observer with @xmath59 ( ballantyne & ramirez - ruiz 2001 ) .",
    "we mention that even when circumstances conducive to fe line emission can not be realized , the action of the plerion for @xmath60 may expel much of the baryons surrounding the grb site out to radii @xmath61 and clear the path for the ensuing fireball , which is a great advantage of the supranova model .",
    "another important implication of the precursor plerion in the supranova model is that the grb should be exploding into a ` radiation - rich ' environment , i.e. into the luminous radiation field of the plerion , which can constitute a large fraction of the pulsar wind luminosity .",
    "such ` external ' photons impinging into the relativistically expanding grb shock from outside would be seen highly doppler - boosted in the shock comoving frame , and act as efficient seeds for inverse compton scattering ( referred to as external comptonization , or ec ) , with important observational consequences for the afterglow emission .",
    "since our focus here is on the possible manisfestations of the ec emission process in the supranova model , we do not attempt a detailed physical modeling of the the plerion dynamics , employing instead a simplified description for illustrative purposes . as discussed by kg02 ,",
    "such modeling would entail various uncertainties and requires a dedicated study by itself , which is out of our current scope .",
    "once a suitable dynamical model of the plerion can be constructed , the formulation of this paper may be used to make more reliable predictions of the afterglow emission .",
    "alternatively , if an afterglow ec emission component is actually observed in the future , we may interpret the data with our formulation so that the unknown properties of the supranova plerion can be probed .",
    "we continue the discussion of the plerion as a roughly homogeneous , spherical bubble with constant energy injection .",
    "following the arguments of the preceding section , it is postulated that the plerion can first penetrate effectively through the expanding sn ejecta , shredding and entraining the ejecta material within a relatively short time .",
    "thereafter , the plerion can be considered to expand into the ambient medium , here taken to be uniform for brevity .",
    "the consequences of the dense , entrained baryonic clumps for the global dynamics of the plerion is unclear , but lacking a realistic model , we do not delve into this complication and make simplified assumptions regarding its evolution .",
    "if the snr filaments are expanding at velocities of order @xmath59 ( as implied by the observed fe line width in grb991216 ) , the expansion velocity of the plerionic bubble @xmath62 may be several times larger than this , judging from the observed expansion velocities in the crab as well as the numerical simulations of jun ( 1998 ) .",
    "as long as the ejecta material is not dynamically well - coupled to the plerion as a whole , we may also estimate @xmath62 from the relativistic blastwave solution of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) in the case of steady , adiabatic energy injection into a uniform medium , which gives @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the expansion bulk lorentz factor , @xmath65 is the ambient density and @xmath66 is a numerical factor of order unity . , @xmath67 ) ; in the nonrelativistic limit ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , the deceleration goes as @xmath70 and @xmath71 . ] a mildly relativistic expansion is then inferred for ages @xmath72 and the values of @xmath16 and @xmath73 considered here .",
    "we assume , at least for the conditions of our interest , that the plerion has been expanding at a nearly constant velocity of @xmath67 , so that its radius @xmath74 .",
    "the luminosity and spectrum emitted by the plerion may be evaluated following ps73 .",

    "we mention that the plerion should also drive a forward shock into the ambient medium , whereby the associated synchrotron radiation may give rise to an additional emission component .",
    "since the magnetic field and the electron injection efficiency in the shocked external medium are expected to be lower than that inside the plerion , such emission should be of subdominant luminosity appearing at frequencies below @xmath100 .",
    "ec scattering of this component by grb blastwave electrons is unimportant for the observed afterglow , as it is likely to be masked by the synchrotron and ssc radiation occurring in the pertinent frequency range ( see below ) ; however the emission at radio frequencies may play a role in the direct detectability of the plerion before the grb (  4 ) . a proper account of this plerion forward shock emission mandates a more detailed description of the plerion expansion , so in this study we choose to neglect this component and restrict ourselves to emission from the plerion interior .      at time @xmath2 after the sn , the pulsar collapses and the grb goes off , sending a fireball and relativistic blastwave into the plerion .",
    "we may distinguish two different situations for how the deceleration of the grb blastwave , and hence the afterglow , initiates .",

    ". however , the problem lies in ascertaining these sources as precursors to grbs , which must be shown to be positionally coincident as well as correlated in time within @xmath2 before the grb . even though the operation periods of batse and rass were close enough in time , the large batse error boxes ( @xmath345 ) preclude discrimination from the large number of agns with similar x - ray spectra",
    ". more precise grb localizations by present and next generation instruments ( e.g. hete-2 with @xmath346 or swift with @xmath347 ) , combined with concurrently conducted wide field x - ray surveys ( e.g. xmm - newton serendipitous survey ) should improve the prospects on searching for grb - precursor plerion associations .",
    "the plerion should also be conspicuous in the optical , e.g. its r - band magnitude would be @xmath348 at @xmath349 .",
    "( the precursor supernova may be observable as well , but could be masked by the luminous plerion . )",
    "again , identifying these with the ensuing grb out of the numerous other objects at similar magnitudes requires accurate grb positions and nearly contemporaneous wide field optical surveys .",
    "this may be possible through serendipitous studies of observations made by e.g. the subaru suprime - cam , the sloan digital sky survey , and the future supernova acceleration probe mission .",
    "detection at radio frequencies may also be possible if there is additional emission from the plerion forward shock (  [ sec : ple ] ) .",
    "we summarize the salient points of our work . in the supranova model of grbs",
    ", the fast - rotating smns active during the time between the sn and the grb should drive a luminous plerionic nebula into the preburst environment , with a number of important consequences for the ensuing grb afterglow .",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities acting at the plerion - sn ejecta interface may induce significant filamentary clumping of the ejecta material , allowing a favorable geometry and enhanced emissivity for the afterglow fe line emission .",
    "the plerion radiation field can act as seeds for ec cooling and emission in the grb external shock , leading to prominent gev - tev gamma - rays during the afterglow , which is detectable by glast out to typical grb redshifts , and distinguishable from ssc emission by its characteristic spectrum and light curve .",
    "a direct search for the plerion emission prior to the grb may be conducted through accurate grb positions and concurrent wide field surveys , e.g. in the optical and x - rays .",
    "all of these should provide critical tests for the supranova model in the near future .",
    "the ability of the plerion to effectively fragment the snr and penetrate between the ejecta material is an uncertain aspect of our scenario .",
    "we may therefore consider the consequences of the plerion being completely confined inside the snr shell instead . in the case of a spherical geometry , such a circumstance would be at odds with constraints derived from the observed fe lines , since : 1 ) the snr would likely be optically thick to thomson scattering at the time of the grb , so that no prompt or afterglow emission can be seen ( eq.[eqn : nes ] ) ; 2 ) the snr shell , as well as the plerionic bubble material , would be dense enough to decelerate the grb blastwave in a time shorter than the observed afterglow ; and 3 ) the radiation density of the plerion would be so large as to cause excessively fast cooling of electrons in the afterglow blastwave .",
    "a possible alternative is a snr - confined plerion with a globally anisotropic geometry , being elongated in the direction of the grb beam , as discussed by kg02 and guetta & granot ( 2002 ) .",
    "the true efficacy of rt instabilities at the snr - plerion interface should be clarified through future high - resolution numerical simulations including all the relevant microphysics .",
    "arons ( 2002 ) has recently discussed in more detail the plausibility of a powerful pulsar wind shredding the surrounding snr in the context of a model for cosmic ray acceleration by magnetars .",
    "although we have concentrated on the case of the pulsar spinning down exclusively via a magnetospheric wind , there is a possibility that significant spindown can also occur through gravitational wave emission , such as those driven by r - mode instabilities ( e.g. andersson et al . 2000 , stergioulas & font 2001 , lindblom , tohline & vallisneri 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however , many aspects of the present theoretical calculations regarding gravitational waves are uncertain ( fryer & woosley 2001 ) .",

    "<S> the supranova model of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , in which the grb event is preceded by a supernova ( sn ) explosion by a few months to years , has recently gained support from fe line detections in the x - ray afterglows of some grbs . a crucial ingredient of this model yet to be studied is the fast - rotating pulsar that should be active during the time interval between the sn and the grb , driving a powerful wind and a luminous plerionic nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some observational consequences of this precursor plerion , which should provide important tests for the supranova model : 1 ) the fragmentation of the outlying sn ejecta material by the plerion and its implications for fe line emission ; and 2 ) the effect of inverse compton cooling and emission in the grb external shock due to the plerion radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> the plerion - induced inverse compton emission can dominate in the gev - tev energy range during the afterglow , being detectable by glast from redshifts @xmath0 and by agile from redshifts @xmath1 , and distinguishable from self - compton emission by its spectrum and light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the prospects for direct detection and identification of the precursor plerion emission are also briefly considered .    </S>",
