    "since the pioneering papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks @xcite , complex networks , which describe many systems in nature and society , have become an area of tremendous recent interest @xcite . in the last few years , modeling real - life systems has attracted an exceptional amount of attention within the physics community .",
    "while a lot of models have been proposed , most of them are stochastic @xcite .",
    "however , because of their advantages , deterministic networks have also received much attention  @xcite .",
    "first , the method of generating deterministic networks makes it easier to gain a visual understanding of how networks are shaped , and how do different nodes relate to each other  @xcite ; moreover , deterministic networks allow to compute analytically their properties : degree distribution , clustering coefficient , average path length , diameter , betweenness , modularity and adjacency matrix whose eigenvalue spectrum characterizes the topology  @xcite .",
    "the first model for deterministic scale - free networks was proposed by barabsi _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite and was intensively studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . another elegant model , called pseudofractal scale - free web ( psw )  @xcite ,",
    "was introduced by dorogovtsev , goltsev , and mendes , and was extended by comellas _",
    ".  @xcite . based on a similar idea of psw , jung _ et al .",
    "_ presented a class of recursive trees  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in order to discuss modularity , ravasz _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a hierarchical network model  @xcite , the exact scaling properties and extensive study of which were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , in relation to the problem of apollonian space - filing packing , andrade _ et al . _ introduced apollonian networks  @xcite which were also proposed by doye and massen in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been intensively investigated @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above models , deterministic networks can be created by various techniques : modification of some regular graphs  @xcite , addition and product of graphs  @xcite , edge iterations  @xcite and other mathematical methods as in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as mentioned by barabsi _",
    "_ , it would be of major theoretical interest to construct deterministic models that lead to scale - free networks  @xcite . here",
    "we do an extensive study on pseudofractal scale - free web  @xcite .",
    "the psw can be considered as a process of edge multiplication .",
    "in fact , a clique ( edge is a special case of it ) can also reproduce new cliques and the number of the new reproduction may be different at a time . motivated by this , in a simple recursive way we propose a general model for psw by including two parameters , with psw as a particular case of the present model .",
    "the deterministic construction of our model enables one to obtain the analytic solutions for its structure properties . by adjusting the parameters",
    ", we can obtain a variety of scale - free networks .",
    "before introducing our model we give the following definitions on a graph ( network ) . the term _ size _ refers to the number of edges in a graph .",
    "the number of nodes in a graph is called its _",
    "order_. when two nodes of a graph are connected by an edge , these nodes are said to be _ adjacent _ , and the edge is said to join them .",
    "complete graph _ is a graph in which all nodes are adjacent to one another .",
    "thus , in a complete graph , every possible edge is present .",
    "the complete graph with @xmath1 nodes is denoted as @xmath2 ( also referred in the literature as @xmath1-_clique _ ) .",
    "two graphs are _",
    "isomorphic _ when the nodes of one can be relabeled to match the nodes of the other in a way that preserves adjacency .",
    "so all @xmath1-cliques are isomorphic to one another .     and @xmath3 .",
    "only the first three steps are shown.,width=491 ]    the network is constructed in a recursive way .",
    "we denote the network after @xmath4 steps by @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ recursive ] ) .",
    "then the network at step @xmath4 is constructed as follows : for @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a complete graph @xmath9 ( or @xmath10-clique ) consist of @xmath11 @xmath1-cliques ) , and @xmath8 has @xmath11 nodes and @xmath12 edges . for @xmath13 , @xmath5",
    "is obtained from @xmath14 by adding @xmath15 new nodes for each of its existing subgraphs isomorphic to a @xmath1-clique , and each new node is connected to all the nodes of this subgraph . in the special case @xmath16 and @xmath3 ,",
    "it is reduced to the pseudofractal scale - free web described in ref . @xcite . in the limiting case of @xmath16",
    ", we obtain the same networks as in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , our family is richer as @xmath15 can take any natural value .",
    "there is an interpretation called ` aggregation ' @xcite for our model . as an example , here we only explain them for the case of @xmath16 and @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ pseudofractal ] illustrates the growing process for this particular case , which may be accounted for as an ` aggregation ' process described in detail as follows .",
    "first , three of the initial triangle ( @xmath7 ) are assembled to form a new unit ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "then we assemble three of these units at the hubs ( the nodes with highest degree ) in precise analogy with the step leading from @xmath7 to @xmath17 to form a new cell ( @xmath18 ) ( see fig . [ aggregation ] ) .",
    "this process can be iterated an arbitrary number of times .",

    "below we will find that the tunable parameters @xmath15 and @xmath1 control some relevant characteristics of the network @xmath5 . because @xmath3 is a particular case , for conveniences , we treat @xmath3 and @xmath21 separately .",

    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 , it follows that @xmath31 then the number of nodes increases with time exponentially and the total number of nodes present at step @xmath4 is @xmath32 thus for large @xmath4 , the average degree @xmath33 is approximately @xmath34 .",

    "it follows that the degree distribution is given by @xmath41 and that the cumulative degree distribution @xcite is @xmath42 substituting for @xmath38 in this expression using @xmath43 gives @xmath44 so the degree distribution follows the power law with the exponent @xmath45 . for the particular case of @xmath16 , eq .",

    "_ as the field has progressed , degree correlation @xcite has been the subject of particular interest , because it can give rise to some interesting network structure effects . an interesting quantity related to degree correlations",

    "when @xmath52 increases with @xmath51 , it means that nodes have a tendency to connect to nodes with a similar or larger degree . in this case",
    "the network is defined as assortative @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath53 is decreasing with @xmath51 , which implies that nodes of large degree are likely to have near neighbors with small degree , then the network is said to be disassortative . if correlations are absent , @xmath54 .",
    "we can exactly calculate @xmath55 for the networks using eq .",
    "( [ ki1 ] ) to work out how many links are made at a particular step to nodes with a particular degree . except for three initial nodes generated at step 0",

    "all links to nodes with larger degree are made at the creation step , and then links to nodes with smaller degree are made at each subsequent steps .",

    "_ clustering coefficient . _",
    "the clustering coefficient defines a measure of the level of cohesiveness around any given node . by definition , the clustering coefficient  @xcite @xmath64 of node @xmath36 is the ratio between the number of edges @xmath65 that actually exist among the @xmath66 neighbors of node @xmath36 and its maximum possible value , @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of the whole network is the average of all individual @xmath69 .",
    "next we will compute the clustering coefficient of every node and their average value .",
    "obviously , when a new node @xmath36 joins the network , its degree @xmath70 and @xmath71 is @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "each subsequent addition of a link to that node increases both @xmath70 and @xmath71 by one .",
    "thus , @xmath71 equals to @xmath74 for all nodes at all steps .",

    "_ diameter .",
    "_ the diameter of a network is defined as the maximum of the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes , which characterizes the longest communication delay in the network .",
    "small diameter is consistent with the concept of small - world and it is easy to compute for our networks .",

    "it is easy to see that at step @xmath84 ( resp .",
    "@xmath85 ) , the diameter is equal to 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) . at each step",
    "@xmath86 , one can easily see that the diameter always lies between a pair of nodes that have just been created at this step . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we first note that it is unnecessary to look at all the nodes in the networks in order to find the diameter . in other words ,",
    "some nodes added at a given step can be ignored , because they do not increase the diameter from the previous step .",
    "these nodes are those that connect to edges that already existed before step @xmath87 . indeed , for these nodes we know that a similar construction has been done in previous steps , so we can ignore them for the computation of the diameter .",
    "let us call `` outer '' nodes the nodes which are connected to a edge that did not exist at previous steps .",
    "clearly , at each step , the diameter depends on the distances between outer nodes .    at any step @xmath86",
    ", we note that an outer node can not be connected with two or more nodes that were created during the same step @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , we know that from step @xmath72 , no outer node is connected to two nodes of the initial triangle @xmath89 .",
    "thus , for any step @xmath86 , any outer node is connected with nodes that appeared at pairwise different steps .",
    "now consider two outer nodes created at step @xmath86 , say @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath90 is connected to two nodes , and one of them must have been created before or during step @xmath92 .",
    "we repeat this argument , and we end up with two cases : ( 1 ) @xmath93 is even . then",
    ", if we make @xmath15  jumps \" , from @xmath90 we reach the initial triangle @xmath89 , in which we can reach any @xmath91 by using an edge of @xmath89 and making @xmath15 jumps to @xmath91 in a similar way . thus @xmath94 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath95 is odd . in this case",
    "we can stop after @xmath15 jumps at @xmath96 , for which we know that the diameter is 2 , and make @xmath15 jumps in a similar way to reach @xmath91 . thus @xmath97 .",
    "it is easily seen that the bound can be reached by pairs of outer nodes created at step @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , those two nodes @xmath90 and @xmath91 share the property that they are connected to two nodes that appeared respectively at steps @xmath87 , @xmath92 .    hence , formally , @xmath98 for any @xmath99 . note that @xmath100 , thus the diameter is small and scales logarithmically with the number of network nodes .      in these cases , the analysis is a little difficult than those of the last subsection .",
    "an alternative approach has to be adopted , although it may also holds true for the first case in some situations .",
    "the method of the last subsection is relatively easy to generalize to these cases , and below we will address it , focusing on order , size , degree distribution , clustering coefficient and diameter .",

    "our model is actually a tunable generalization of the growing deterministic scale - free networks introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . aside from their deterministic structures ,",
    "the statistical properties of the resulting networks are equivalent with the random models that are commonly used to generate scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the exact results for degree distribution and clustering coefficient , as well as the diameter , which agree well with large amount of real observations @xcite .",
    "the degree exponent can be adjusted , the clustering coefficient is very large , and the diameter is small . therefore",
    ", out model may perform well in mimicking a variety of scale - free networks in real - life world . moreover , our networks consist of cliques , which has been observed in variety of the real - world networks , such as movie actor collaboration networks , scientific collaboration networks and networks of company directors @xcite .",

    "<S> analytical results show that the resulting networks are disassortative and follow power - law degree distributions , with a more general degree exponent tuned from 2 to @xmath0 ; the clustering coefficient of each individual node is inversely proportional to its degree and the average clustering coefficient of all nodes approaches to a large nonzero value in the infinite network order ; the diameter grows logarithmically with the number of network nodes . </S>",
    "<S> all these reveal that the networks described by our model have small - world effect and scale - free topology .    </S>",
