    "there are several schemes in multi user networks to manage interference .",
    "if interference is weak , the interfering signal is treated as noise .",
    "this approach has been used in practice for a long time , e.g. , for frequency - reuse in cellular systems .",
    "however , information theoretic validation for this approach has only recently been obtained @xcite . on the other hand , for the cases where interference is strong",
    ", the interfering signal can be decoded along with the desired signal and hence canceled @xcite .",
    "however , the general condition for strong interference in a @xmath2 user ic is unknown .",
    "the problem has been solved for some special cases such as symmetric ic .",
    "lattice - based codes have been used to characterize a `` very strong '' regime @xcite , the generalized degrees - of - freedom@xcite , and the approximate sum capacity @xcite , for symmetric k user ics .",
    "if the strength of interference is comparable to the desired signal , then interference is avoided by orthogonalizing the channel access .",
    "primary schemes , such as time ( frequency ) division multiple access schemes , avoid interference by orthogonally assigning the channel between users . considering the entire bandwidth as a cake , these schemes cut the cake equally between the users . therefore ,",
    "if there are @xmath0 users in the channel , each user gets roughly @xmath3 of the channel .",
    "these orthogonal schemes , however , have been proved not to be bandwidth efficient . during the idle condition",
    ", these schemes do not effectively utilize time slot or frequency bandwidth allocated to a user .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the regime where all desired and interfering signals are of comparable strength . a recent strategy to deal with interference",
    "is interference alignment .",
    "the idea of interference alignment is to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at the receivers , facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques .",
    "the remaining dimensions are dedicated for communicating the desired signal , keeping it free from interference .",
    "interference alignment is first introduced by maddah ali et .",
    "@xcite , for x channels .",
    "cadambe and jafar @xcite , proposed the linear vector interference alignment ( lia ) scheme for ic and proved that this method is capable of reaching optimal degrees of freedom of the ic .",
    "the optimal degrees of freedom for the @xmath0 user ic is obtained in the same paper to be @xmath4 .",
    "the proposed scheme in @xcite is applied over many parallel channels and achieves the optimal degrees of freedom as the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) goes to infinity .",
    "nazer et al .",
    ", @xcite , proposed the so called ergodic ia scheme to achieve @xmath5 interference - free ergodic capacity of interference channel at any signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this scheme is based on a particular pairing of the channel matrices .",
    "the scheme needs roughly the same order of channel extension as @xcite , to achieve optimum performance .",
    "@xcite proposes a new scheme called channel aided ia .",
    "it makes use of the channel structure besides the linear ia schemes to achieve total number of dof in a @xmath0 user interference channel .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , @xcite obtains a more general relationship between paired channel matrices , and thus , significantly reduces the number of required channel extension .    a majority of systems considered so far for ia involve only multiple unicast traffic , where each transmitted message is only demanded by a single receiver . however , there are wireless multicast applications where a common message may be demanded by multiple receivers , e.g. , in a wireless video broadcasting .",
    "the generalization of the multiple unicasts scenario considered in @xcite to the case where each receiver is interested in an arbitrary subset of transmitted messages is considered in @xcite and dof region for this network is evaluated in this work .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the generalization of our previous work @xcite , to the case of interference networks with general message demands . in this setup , there are @xmath0 transmitters and @xmath1 receivers , each equipped with a single antenna .",
    "each transmitter emits a unique message and each receiver is interested in an arbitrary subset of the messages .",
    "our main result in this paper is the general relationship required between the paired channel matrices that are suitable for canceling interference , assuming linear combining of paired channel output signals .",
    "so far , ia feasibility literature have mainly focused on network topology , using the concept of proper systems @xcite . to ease some of interference alignment requirements by using channel structure",
    ", @xcite investigates dof for the partially connected ics where some arbitrary interfering links are assumed disconnected .",
    "in contrast , this work evaluates the necessary and sufficient conditions on channel structure of a fully connected general interference network to make perfect ia feasible within limited number of channel extension .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is introduced in section 2 . in section 3 , it is argued why linear ia scheme , over a single antenna interference channel , can not achieve total number of dof with limited number of channel extensions . the proposed scheme is described in section 4 .",
