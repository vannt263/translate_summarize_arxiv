    "for a wind blowing over a surface the velocity and pressure are related by bernoulli s equation ; @xmath0 is conserved along streamlines . because the velocity increases as the wind passes over a protrusion of the surface , the pressure must decrease .",
    "this causes a force pulling the higher regions of the surface upwards .",
    "this force also causes lift on airplane wings .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability occurs for the same physical reason at the boundary of two fluids of different densities moving respect to one another ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a related instability exists for wind passing over water or for wind passing over fabric ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    near accreting compact objects such as active galactic nuclei",
    ", substantial amounts of kinetic energy can be present in a wind which may pass near denser colder material in the outer parts of an accretion disk . in this paper",
    "we consider the possibility that a wind passing over a dense disk can result in a warp instability similar to that caused by radiative forces @xcite .",
    "previous work , @xcite , has considered the torque on a disk which would be caused by ram pressure or the reaction force from a wind but has not explored the possibility that the wind / disk interaction could lift the disk , and so cause a warping instability .",
    "we divide the problem into two parts , a diffuse outflowing wind and a dense infinitely thin disk .",
    "we first compute the effect of a vertical perturbation or ripple in the disk on the wind .",
    "the flow has a perturbation in the pressure along the surface of the disk which pushes on the disk .",
    "we then incorporate this force into the equations of motion in the disk .",
    "this approach is similar to that used to investigate wind / water wave interactions or wind / fabric interactions .",
    "we follow the perturbative approach of @xcite .",
    "we describe a warped surface by a displacement in the direction normal to its undisturbed plane , @xmath1\\ ] ] where @xmath2 .",
    "we assume a primarily radial flow with velocity @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a perturbation , @xmath5 .",
    "we constrain the velocity so the component normal to the surface is zero ; @xmath6 .",
    "this constraint implies that on the surface @xmath7.\\ ] ]    the continuity equation , @xmath8 , in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the density in the wind .",
    "when the wind is subsonic , we search for a solution for the velocity and pressure perturbations in the wind that decays exponentially with increasing distance from the displaced surface .",
    "when the wind is supersonic , we search for a solution for the velocity and pressure perturbations that vary in phase with distance from the displaced surface . @xmath11 \\\\ v_\\theta&= &   { \\rm re } \\left [ v_{\\theta,1 } g(r,\\theta , z , t ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\",

    "is directly related to @xmath19 where the one fluid is moving with respect to the other in the @xmath20 direction . for incompressible potential flow solutions",
    "the vertical forms of the variables are solved exactly and they decay exponentially with height when the flow is subsonic and vary in phase with height when the flow is supersonic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the the tight winding limit ( @xmath21 ) and to first order the continuity equation becomes @xmath22 euler s equation to first order in the same coordinate system @xmath23 again in the tight winding limit @xmath24 from equations ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ eulers ] ) we find that @xmath25 where the sign of the @xmath26 term is positive for @xmath27 and negative for @xmath28 . neglecting the @xmath29 term in the tight winding limit @xmath30 which relates the vertical exponential scale length or wavenumber to the radial wavenumber .        using equations([vz ] , [ eulers ] )",
    "we can see that @xmath31 when the wind is subsonic , the frequencies and wavevectors are real and @xmath32 , then @xmath33 for @xmath34 . where the surface is high , above the surface the pressure is lower than the mean and below the surface the pressure is higher .",
    "this causes a destabilizing force which we also call lift in analogy to the aerodynamics of wings . because the sign of the pressure perturbation is opposite on either size of the disk ( @xmath35 ) , the pressure differential across the surface exerts a force on the surface with magnitude twice @xmath36 in the direction normal to the surface ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the pressure differential across the surface caused by the wind should exert a force on the surface .",
    "an instability should exit when @xmath37 which is a direct analogy for the kelvin - helmholtz instability or for the instability of a wind passing over fabric .",
    "when the wind is supersonic , the pressure perturbations are 90 degrees out of phase with the surface perturbations .",
    "the phase of the pressure perturbations should increase with both @xmath38 and @xmath39 which implies that the sign of @xmath18 is the same as the sign of @xmath40 . because the sign of the pressure perturbation is opposite on either size of the disk",
    ", there is a drag force on the surface which is not present when the flow is subsonic and approximated as a potential flow solution . because shocks should form we expect the actual flow to be more complicated than given by the above equations ( see figure 2 for an illustration ) .",
    "when the shocks and expansion waves lag the high points of the surface , we expect a vertical force on the high points of the surface which pushes the surface towards the midplane . when @xmath37 , instead of a destabilizing lift force , we expect a stabilizing vertical force .",
    "but since there is drag , energy from the wind is transferred to the surface and the amplitude of the surface perturbation should increase ( e.g. ,  5.5 of @xcite on the kelvin helmholtz instability with a supersonic flow ) .        when @xmath41 for both subsonic and supersonic flows we must consider the torque on an annulus , which is the cross product of the radial vector and the pressure differential , integrated azimuthally about the ring .",
    "to integrate the torque azimuthally we now shift notation and follow that used by @xcite to describe the warped disk .",
    "the tilt vector for a ring at radius @xmath38 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the local angle of tilt of the disk with respect to the @xmath44 axis , and the descending node of the disk material is at an angle @xmath45 to the @xmath20 axis .",
    "the unit vector toward points on the surface @xmath46 where @xmath47 at the descending node and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both functions of @xmath38 . the external coordinate system , @xmath50 , which in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath51 where @xmath52 , can be related to that described by equation ( [ xhat ] ) . when @xmath53 @xmath54 and the vertical displacement of the surface or @xmath44 component of @xmath55 @xmath56 to relate this formalism to that used in the previous section we set @xmath57 , @xmath41 and @xmath58 so that @xmath59 which is in the same form as equation([warp ] ) .",

    "to first order in @xmath49 @xmath64 @xmath65 ( see @xcite , equations 2.11 and 2.17 ) where @xmath66 and @xmath67 refer to the derivatives of @xmath49 and @xmath48 with respect to @xmath38 .     when the wind is subsonic , in the previous section we found to first order that the pressure differential across the surface was in phase with the corrugations of the surface .",
    "however , the pressure in the region of laminar flow should actually be somewhat lower on the leeward side of each trough and so that there would be a lag between the pressure and the surface variations @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured sinusoidal pressure variations in response to a wind passing over a sinusoidally varying ruber surface and showed that the pressure was indeed offset in phase with the surface .",
    "we assume that the pressure difference across the disk surface can be described @xmath68 where the phase lag between the pressure and the surface is given by @xmath69 .",
    "for @xmath70 we expect @xmath71 and that @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "when the wind is supersonic , shocks should cause an effective phase shift in the pressure perturbation on the surface . in this case @xmath74 where @xmath75 see equation([pressure ] ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath76 depends on the sign of @xmath40 , since the sign of @xmath18 depends on the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "the pressure differential across the surface exerts a force on the disk parallel to the normal to the surface , @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting torque per unit mass per unit mass for an annulus is the integral @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the disk surface density ( mass per unit area ) .",

    "we can see that the first term in this equation causes the disk to precess , and the second term causes the tilt to increase or decrease .",
    "the tilt increases when @xmath83 or @xmath73 , for a subsonic wind and when @xmath84 or @xmath85 for a supersonic wind ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the third term corresponds to a rate of change in the total angular momentum of the annulus which would cause a small amount of outflow in the disk .",
    "the angular momentum per unit mass of an annulus of radius @xmath38 is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the angular rotation rate . when radial motions in the disk are small @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the torque from gravity ( equal to zero when the potential is spherical ) and @xmath90 is the torque due to viscous forces .",
    "as done by @xcite , we set @xmath91 so that @xmath92,{\\rm im}[w],1)$ ] . ignoring the @xmath44 component of the torque and using equation([torque ] )",

    "we define a parameter @xmath97 which describes the ratio of the kinetic energy in the wind to the rotational energy in the disk , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the density of the wind and @xmath100 is the velocity of a particle in a circular orbit . we can write @xmath101 the precession rate @xmath102 where to simplify the expression we have assumed @xmath103 or @xmath104 and ignored the dependence on the adiabatic index .    for a subsonic wind ,",
    "growing modes occur when @xmath72 .",
    "we expect that the phase lag @xmath72 when @xmath73 so that growing modes will occur for @xmath105 .",
    "the growing mode will have lines of nodes following a trailing spiral instead of a leading spiral as was the case for the radiatively driven warp instability @xcite . for a supersonic wind ,",
    "growing modes occur when @xmath106 and so will have a leading spiral shape .",
    "we expect the growing mode to grow as @xmath107 with growth timescale @xmath108 in terms of the dynamical time , @xmath109 , @xmath110 when the wind is supersonic , the growth rate exceeds the precession rate and the amplitude of the perturbation can grow quickly .",
    "we see that the precession and growth rates depend on @xmath97 , the ratio of the kinetic energy in the wind and the rotational energy in the disk .",
    "though we have neglected the viscous forces ( in equation [ torque_general ] ) , we expect them to damp the growth of unstable modes primarily for the short wavelength modes .",
    "we expect the disk self gravity to affect the precession frequency but not strongly affect the growth rate of the mode .",
    "since we have followed the notation by @xcite , we can directly compare the importance of the torque caused by the wind to that caused by the absorption of radiation from a central source . ignoring the viscous damping term ,",
    "the precession rate caused by the radiative torque is given by @xmath111 ( equations 3.6 , 3.8 by @xcite ) . comparing this to our equations([wequation],[omegaq ] ) we find that the wind driven warping instability is likely to dominate when @xmath112 we can interpret this inequality in terms of the momentum flux .",
    "when the momentum flux from the wind dominates that from a central radiation source , a wind driven instability may dominate .",
    "this suggests that accreting sources which impart more energy into driving winds than into radiation would be more likely to drive wind driven instabilities in their accretion disks .",
    "the simplest description of subsonic wind flow near a corrugated surface such as a flag or water wave is an irrotational flow above the interface with wind velocity averaged over one wavelength that is constant with height .",
    "this is a `` potential flow '' @xcite and since the pressure is related to the wind velocity via bernoulli s equation , it is in exact anti - phase with the surface ( as derived perturbatively above ) .",
    "so the energy flux between the wind and wave is zero . for the wind to do work on the wave",
    ", the pressure must be shifted in phase relative to the potential solution .",
    "@xcite suggested that the downwind side of the wave is sheltered from the wind so that the pressure on this slope is reduced there but increased on the upwind side .",
    "this causes a drag force , and as a result waves traveling with the wind increase in amplitude and those traveling against the wind are damped .",
    "scaling based on idealized theory for this ( @xcite , and subsequent work ) unfortunately does not predict the experimentaly measured growth rates very well ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the theory outlined by @xcite ,",
    "the phase lag is set by numerical constants determined from turbulent mean profiles and does not depend upon the amplitude of the surface variations .",
    "we can understand this considering the difference in the rate that a turbulent boundary layer grows on the leeward and windward sides of a wavy surface . because the growth rate of the boundary layer depends on the pressure gradient along the direction of flow outside the boundary layer",
    ", we expect a difference in the boundary layer thickness on the leeward and windward sides that is proportional to the pressure difference across the wave , and this in turn is proportional to the amplitude of the wave .",
    "however , the thickness of the boundary layer may be set by a turbulent eddy viscosity and so should also be proportional to the amplitude of the surface perturbation .",
    "thus , we predict that the phase angle is not be strongly dependent on the amplitude of the surface variations .    in most astrophysical situations we expect high reynolds number flows and so can draw on the theory of aerodynamics .",
    "a laminar or viscous boundary layer next to a surface is only stable when the pressure gradient along the surface in the direction of flow is negative .",
    "however this condition is violated to the leeward of a corrugation .",
    "the same situation occurs along airplane wings and the boundary layer becomes turbulent . because of the coanda effect , turbulent boundary layers are less likely to separate from the surface than viscous boundary layers .",
    "this allows the boundary layer to remain near the surface along airplane wings even though the pressure gradient in the laminar flow region is not favorable . for most airplane wings the boundary layer does not separate from the surface until the angle of attack from the wing is @xmath113 , though this critical angle can increase to @xmath114 for short thick wings . past this critical angle , little or no lift",
    "is generated and the wing ` stalls ' .",
    "we expect a similar effect in our astrophysical disk .",
    "when the amplitude of the corrugations reaches a critical slope , ( a critical value for @xmath115 ) , we expect that the boundary layer will separate from the surface , the lift will decrease causing the precession rate to drop , and the drag will increase . at this point",
    "we expect the mode to saturate .",
    "when the wind is supersonic , a smooth continuous flow is unlikely ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a full calculation would require resolving shocks and expansion flows .",
    "however the perturbative method we have used should allow us to at least estimate the magnitude of the instability .",
    "we do expect a major difference in the character of the wind flow near the surface when the slope of the surface exceeds the mach angle , or when @xmath116 .",
    "past this angle a turbulent boundary layer should develop and the instability may saturate . in this regime",
    "it may be possible to estimate the torque on the disk using an approximation ( that of newtonian flow ) which primarily considers ram pressure or reactive force on the disk surface ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have outlined a possible instability which could occur in accreting objects with energetic outflows .",
    "a wind passing over a rotating thin dense disk is likely to cause a warping instability to grow in the disk .",
    "this instability could occur in situations where an energetic outflow driven by a compact object passes over a dense disk , such as might happen in binary x - ray sources or active galactic nuclei . in active galactic nuclei , at radii of order a parsec from a black hole there is evidence for the existence of dense warped disks from maser observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "large scale outflows are predicted for a variety of types of accretion flows and seem to be an integral part of these flows .",
    "observational evidence for disk winds is fairly ubiquitous and seen in both x - ray binaries @xcite and in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when a subsonic wind passes over a corrugated dense disk , the corrugations will cause pressure variations along the surface of the disk .",
    "these pressure variations cause lift , which cause the annuli in the disk to precess .",
    "form drag caused by the corrugated surface will cause pressure variations in the disk to lag the vertical displacement of the disk .",
    "this causes a torque on the warped disk which can increase the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "we expect this instability to saturate or cease growing at a critical slope when the lift decreases due to boundary layer separation .    when a supersonic wind passes over a corrugated disk , the disk primarily experiences form drag .",
    "the drag causes a torque on the warped disk which can increase the amplitude of the corrugations .",
    "when there is an effective lag between the pressure and the vertical velocity of the surface , there will be a vertical force on the disk which causes it to precess .",
    "we expect a major change in the nature of the flow when the slope of the corrugations exceeds the mach angle .",
    "while we primarily expect accreting astrophysical objects to drive supersonic outflows , if a thick outflowing subsonic boundary layer is created , the subsonic theory outlined here may be appropriate inside this layer .",
    "the instability can dominate the radiative induced warping instability in sources where the energy released in an outflow ( either sub or supersonic ) exceeds that emitted as radiation .    in this paper",
    "we have concentrated on a purely hydrodynamic flow .",
    "however we expect the magnetic field to be dynamically important both in the disk and wind .",
    "if the wind and disk are magnetized , flux freezing would make the wind and disk act as mutually impenetrable bodies .",
    "the wind would be less likely to cause hydrodynamical instabilities that could destroy the disk . in this paper",
    "we have focused on the affect of a radially outflowing wind on the planarity of a disk in the absence of radiation .",
    "future investigations could develop a prediction for the phase lag angle for subsonic wind flows ( a historically difficult hydrodynamics problem ) , and calculate the details of the shocks which are likely to be present when the wind is supersonic . in this paper",
    "we have restricted our study to radially outflowing winds , however astrophysical outflows typically have a nonzero , radius dependent , azimuthal velocity .",
    "we have also neglected the role of gravitational , magnetic and viscous forces .",
    "future work can consider the role of these forces , include rotating winds and explore the effects of both radiation and winds on the planarity of the disk , particularly in the regime where the winds themselves are radiatively driven .",
    "this work could not have been carried out without helpful discussions with eric blackman , bruce bailey , wayne hacker , and daniel proga .",
