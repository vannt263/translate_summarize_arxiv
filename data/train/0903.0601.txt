    "<S> we measure the absolute branching fractions of @xmath0 semileptonic decays where the hadron in the final state is one of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , using @xmath7 @xmath8 decays collected in the cleo - c detector at a center - of - mass energy close to 4170 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath9% , @xmath10% , @xmath11% , where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain @xmath12% , and @xmath13% , which are the first measurements of cabibbo suppressed exclusive @xmath0 semileptonic decays , and , @xmath14% . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first absolute product branching fraction determination for a semileptonic decay including a scalar meson in the final state .        </S>",
    "<S> the study of @xmath0 semileptonic decays provides interesting information on several aspects of heavy quark decays . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the total semileptonic width provides discrimination between different theoretical evaluations of hadronic matrix elements affecting charm semileptonic decays . the operator product expansion ( ope ) </S>",
    "<S> predicts that all the charmed mesons have the same semileptonic width , modulo non - factorizable corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isgw2 form factor model @xcite predicts a difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath0 inclusive rates , as the spectator quark masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 differ on the scale of the daughter quark mass @xmath17 in the cabibbo favored semileptonic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 and @xmath19 semileptonic widths are equal within the 3% accuracy of the measurements , and the compositions of their inclusive spectra are dominated by the lowest lying resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is explained by the observation that the @xmath20 quark in the final state is usually produced with a small enough momentum to be bound to the spectator anti - quark in an @xmath21 @xmath22 meson @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 semileptonic decays share these kinematic features , and thus an absolute measurement of @xmath0 semileptonic decays sheds some light also on inclusive processes . </S>",
    "<S> specific decays contribute valuable information on light meson properties . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the fraction of semileptonic decays going into @xmath2 and @xmath3 is sensitive to the pseudoscalar mixing angle , and may indeed shed some light on @xmath23-glueball mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , decays including @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the final state can elucidate the nature of exotic light scalar mesons @xcite .    @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> exclusive semileptonic decays have been studied by argus , cleo , babar , and fixed target experiments . </S>",
    "<S> no absolute measurements of branching fractions exist </S>",
    "<S> . the branching fraction @xmath26 , which is the most widely studied @xcite , is generally normalized with respect to the decay @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dalitz plot for this mode shows the presence of a significant broad scalar resonance whose contribution to the observed yields changes depending upon the selection criteria @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , this mode is not suitable for normalization . </S>",
    "<S> recently , </S>",
    "<S> the babar collaboration @xcite used the normalization mode @xmath28 with a mass cut of @xmath29 10 mev around the nominal @xmath1 as suggested in ref .  @xcite , to obtain @xmath30% . </S>",
    "<S> cleo measured @xcite the ratio @xmath31/[\\gamma(\\phi \\ell^+\\nu _ </S>",
    "<S> \\ell)]=1.67\\pm 0.17\\pm 0.17 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , bes  @xcite reported the inclusive branching fraction @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties are too large to allow a meaningful comparison between inclusive and exclusive channels .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a data sample of @xmath33 pb@xmath34 , collected at a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy close to 4170 mev , with the cleo - c detector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the momenta and directions of charged particles are reconstructed in the tracking system , which also provides charged particle identification information based on specific ionization ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) completes the charged particle identification system @xcite , and is critical near 1 gev , where the specific ionization bands of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 overlap . the photon energy and direction </S>",
    "<S> are measured in the csi electromagnetic calorimeter , whose energy measurement @xmath38 , combined with the momentum @xmath39 information from the tracking system , provides the key electron identification variable @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the csi calorimeter measures the electron and photon energies with an r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> resolution of 2.2% at @xmath41  gev and 5% at @xmath42  mev .    at @xmath43 mev , </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath44 annihilation into @xmath45 is approximately @xmath46 nb , while other charm production totals @xmath47 pb , and the light quark continuum cross section is @xmath48 nb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we look for semileptonic decays of the @xmath49 in events in which the @xmath50 is fully reconstructed in a hadronic mode ( tagged events ) . </S>",
    "<S> each event also must include at least one isolated photon , as either the @xmath49 or @xmath50 originates from a @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> here and throughout the paper , charge conjugate decays are implied . </S>",
    "<S> charged tracks are used to form the @xmath50 if their fitted helical trajectory approaches the event origin within a distance of @xmath52 mm in the azimuthal projection and @xmath52 cm in the polar projection ( @xmath53 ) , where the azimuthal projection is in the bend view of the solenoidal magnet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , each track must possess at least 50% of the hits expected , must be within the fiducial volume of the drift chamber , and must have a momentum of at least 40 mev . </S>",
    "<S> pions and kaons are identified using @xmath35 and rich if their momenta are above 700 mev , otherwise only @xmath35 identification is used . </S>",
    "<S> we form @xmath2 and @xmath54 candidates from pairs of photons that deposit energy in the calorimeter in a manner consistent with an electromagnetic shower and are not matched to tracks . </S>",
    "<S> we require that the two photons to have less than @xmath55 pull mass which is defined as the standard deviation from the expected @xmath56 or @xmath2 mass . in the best calorimeter region </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath57 0.71 ) we use photons with energies greater than 30 mev , while in the endcap region ( @xmath58 ) we require an energy greater than 50 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the tag modes used are listed in table i. some tag specific selection criteria are applied . for the modes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the @xmath37 is required to have a momentum greater than 100 mev to suppress the background from @xmath61 decays . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for the mode @xmath62 , two pions of opposite charge must have momentum greater than 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the charged track pairs used to reconstruct @xmath4 ( via @xmath63 ) are required to have an invariant mass within 3@xmath64 of the @xmath4 mass . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the @xmath65 and @xmath66@xmath67  tags , we require candidate @xmath4 to originate from a vertex displaced from the interaction point , and the @xmath4 momentum vector , obtained from a kinematic fit of the charged @xmath37 momenta , must point back to the beam spot </S>",
    "<S> . for resonance decays we select intervals in invariant mass centered on the resonance masses @xcite and within @xmath29 150 mev for @xmath68 , @xmath29 100 mev for @xmath69 , @xmath29 10 mev for @xmath70 or @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the latter @xmath3 decay mode , we apply a helicity angle cut which is the angle measured in the rest frame of the decaying parent particle between the direction of the decay daughter and the direction of the grandparent particle as @xmath72 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> tags are required to have momentum consistent with coming from @xmath73 decay .    </S>",
    "<S> .tagging modes and number of signal and background ( bkg ) events , determined from two - gaussian fits to the invariant mass distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the signal window is @xmath74 of the @xmath50 mass for all modes , except @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last two columns show the corresponding estimates of the number signal and background tags accompanied by a reconstructed @xmath77 from @xmath78 transition , which are determined from the @xmath79 spectrum ( see text ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     </S>",
    "<S> these results allow us to draw several interesting conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the branching fractions measured imply @xmath80 , about 16 % below the value ( @xmath81)% , inferred from measured @xmath82 and @xmath83 inclusive semileptonic branching fraction @xcite and the charmed meson lifetimes @xcite . we have searched for additional hadronic final states formed with two charged tracks , as well as from two charged tracks and a @xmath84 , and found no evidence for semileptonic decays including other hadronic final states . </S>",
    "<S> no other significant branching fraction is expected . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the predictions of the isgw2 model @xcite , supporting the conjecture that su(3 ) is broken in charm semileptonic decays . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the difference in widths may arise from non factorizable contributions at the level of @xmath85 10% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath86 , is in agreement with the previous cleo result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the isgw2 model involves a @xmath87 mixing angle close to @xmath88 , which is the minimum value obtained from mass formulae @xcite if a quadratic approximation is used . according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the measured ratio is consistent with a pseudoscalar mixing angle of about @xmath89 , provided that a glueball component probability of the order of 10% is present in the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have the first measurement of a @xmath0 semileptonic decay including a scalar meson above the threshold for decay to the observed final state , which opens up the exciting possibility of elucidating the nature of exotic light mesons @xcite . </S>"
