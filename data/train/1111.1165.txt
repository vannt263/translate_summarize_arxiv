    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the burkert halo density profile given by @xmath4 with two free parameters , the core radius @xmath0 and the central halo density @xmath1 , is consistent with the available kinematic data in spiral galaxies .",
    "when the mass distribution in these galaxies is modelled using the combined contributions of a  @xcite disk for the luminous matter and a burkert profile for the dark matter halo , the structural parameters obtained ( dm central densities , core radii , disk masses and length scales ) exhibit a series of scaling laws .",
    "this led to the hypothesis of a ",
    "universal rotation curve \" , an empirical function of radius and luminosity that reproduces the rcs of spiral galaxies  ( pss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of the mass distribution in pressure - supported systems like elliptical galaxies is still limited ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent summary of the state of art ) .",
    "on - going observations of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , which occupy the faint end of the luminosity function of pressure - supported systems , are currently yielding crucial information about the properties of the dark and luminous components in these objects and , in turn , on the underlying physical properties of dm haloes  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is , however , an intrinsically difficult task both observationally , in terms of measuring velocities for sufficient numbers of tracers , as well as from a dynamical modelling point of view , due the lack of precise information on the dynamical state of the stellar populations .",
    "the dsphs are typically at least two orders of magnitude less luminous than the faintest spirals , and show evidence of being dm dominated at all radii  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "their typical stellar masses lie in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 , although the luminous masses of some recently discovered objects are as low as @xmath7  @xcite , while their stellar length scales are of order @xmath8 kpc . in these systems",
    ", the dm halo typically outweighs the baryonic matter by a large factor ( from a few tens , up to several hundred ) .",
    "an understanding of these objects is therefore essential for understanding the nature of dark matter itself and to build an observational picture of the outcome of galaxy formation on small scales .",
    "additionally , high - redshift dsph pre - cursors most likely contributed significantly to the build - up of the stellar halo of the milky way  @xcite .",
    "given that the observed dsphs are predominantly old , pressure - supported , spheroidal systems , their evolutionary histories would be expected to differ significantly from those of spirals , especially in the baryonic components  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as in the case of spiral galaxies ,",
    "a number of authors have found evidence of universality in the dm halo properties of dsph galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the variation of the mass - to - light ratios of dsphs with total luminosity was consistent with all dsphs containing similar masses of dark matter within the volume occupied by their stellar distributions .",
    "this implies a larger proportion of dark matter in the less luminous objects , a general characteristic of spiral galaxy haloes  @xcite .",
    "more recent analyses @xcite , based on extended velocity dispersion profiles rather than central velocity dispersions alone , have generally supported this conclusion .",
    "a number of important questions remain unanswered . first , is the distribution of dm on galactic ( i.e. kpc ) scales really universal ?",
    "for example ,  @xcite have noted the existence of considerable scatter in the estimated masses of the lowest luminosity systems , and several authors have presented evidence of systematic differences between the properties of the milky way dsph satellites and those surrounding m31",
    "secondly , why do the properties of the dark and luminous mass distributions appear to be related , even though baryons dominate , at most , only the inner regions of galaxies ?",
    "the study of the internal kinematics of the milky way dsphs has been revolutionized by the availability of multi - object spectrographs on 4 m and 8m - class telescopes .",
    "large data sets comprising between several hundred and several thousand individual stellar velocities per galaxy have now been acquired for all the luminous dsphs surrounding the milky way @xcite .",
    "the volume of the currently available data is sufficient to measure the dynamical masses interior to the stellar distributions of the dsphs .",
    "however , the mass profiles remain less well - determined .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that these profiles are consistent with the cuspy dark matter haloes produced in cosmological n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as with more general families of haloes that range from centrally cored to steeply cusped @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles alone can not distinguish between cored and cusped haloes due to the degeneracy between mass and velocity anisotropy  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently showed that the kinematic data and additional features in a small number of the well - studied dsphs are consistent with cored dm potentials , under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and velocity isotropy .",
    "in addition , several authors have presented arguments which suggest that the internal kinematics of dsphs may be more consistent with cored haloes  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate whether dm haloes of burkert form are consistent with the observed kinematics of the luminous milky way dsphs .",
    "as noted above , burkert haloes provide good matches to the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and it is therefore interesting to ask whether they are also relevant models for galaxies of other hubble types . we also wish to explore whether the parameters of the best - fit burkert profiles for the dsphs lie on the extrapolation to the dsph regime of the scaling relations seen in spiral galaxies . while previous work has already shown that the internal kinematics of the milky way dsphs may be consistent with cored haloes @xcite , it does not necessarily follow that burkert profiles in particular reproduce the observed kinematic data .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the form of the dsph dark matter halo density is known and only the length scale and density scale can vary .",
    "we allow the velocity anisotropy of the stellar distribution to vary in order to reproduce the observed dispersion profiles as closely as possible .",
    "finally , we compare the resulting dm structural parameters with the low - luminosity extrapolation of the relations between the equivalent parameters found in spirals .    some of the comparisons between dsphs and spirals require us to define a stellar length scale for the dsphs which plays the same role as the disk scale length @xmath9 in spirals . one way to do this is to identify the location of the peak in the circular velocity curves in each system which would be predicted if the stellar components were assumed to contribute all the gravitating mass .",
    "for a freeman disk , this peak occurs at @xmath10 .",
    "if the stellar components of the dsphs are modelled using a  @xcite sphere the corresponding radius is at 1.4 @xmath11 ( @xmath11 is the projected half - light radius ) .",
    "thus , where necessary , we associate the spiral disk length scale @xmath9 with the radius 0.64 @xmath11 in the dsphs . however , we note that most of our conclusions in this paper do not make use of this length scale .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "data ] , we summarize the observational data used in our study and describe in detail the analysis of the dsph data .",

    "we assume that the luminous component of each dsph consists of a single , pressure - supported stellar population that is in dynamical equilibrium and therefore traces the underlying gravitational potential which we assume to be dominated by the dark matter halo .",
    "the masses of these stellar spheroids can be estimated from their luminosities : they are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the dynamical masses .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass - to - light ratios ( m / l)@xmath12 are unity . while the actual ( m / l)@xmath12 ratios may vary by about a factor of two depending on the details of the stellar populations  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the uncertainties in the modelling results are dominated by the unknown velocity anisotropy .",
    "the jeans equation relates the density and velocity dispersion of the stellar component to the mass profile of the dark matter halo . assuming spherical symmetry , the jeans equation for a non - rotating system can be written @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 represent the 3-dimensional density , radial velocity dispersion , and orbital anisotropy , respectively , of the stellar component , and @xmath17 is the mass profile of the dark matter halo . in this analysis",
    "the orbital anisotropy @xmath18 is not constrained , as all information about the velocity distribution is restricted to the component along the line of sight .",

    "we obtain ( marginalised ) 1-d posterior probability distribution functions for each free parameter using a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm .",
    "specifically , we use the same metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite described in detail by @xcite . in order to account for the error associated with observational uncertainty in the half - light radius , for each point sampled in our mcmc chains we scatter the adopted value of @xmath11 by a random",
    "deviate drawn from a gaussian distribution with standard deviation equal to the published error @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution functions for the free parameters are thus effectively marginalised over the range of half - light radii consistent with observations .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles corresponding to the highest - likelihood ( equation [ eq : likelihood ] ) point from each of our mcmc chains are over - plotted on the empirical profiles in figure [ fig : burkert_profiles ] .",
    "these ` best fits ' demonstrate that burkert profiles can provide an excellent description of dsph velocity dispersion profiles . for each free parameter , we take the 1-d posterior probability distribution obtained from our mcmc chains as the observational constraint , given our modelling assumptions . for each free parameter ( and combinations thereof ) , table [ tab : mcmcresults ]",
    "identifies the median value and confidence intervals that enclose the central 68% ( and 95% ) of accepted points in our chains .",

    "the data in the table also exhibit the well - known mass - anisotropy degeneracy : because the dispersion profiles of the dsphs are essentially flat to large radii and have a relatively small range of amplitudes , larger values of @xmath42 are required for galaxies with more radially biased velocity distributions .",
    "our analysis is particularly susceptible to this degeneracy due to our restriction of the modelling to burkert halo profiles .",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : rho0r0 ] , we find similar @xmath1 vs @xmath0 relationships _ independently _ of whether the mass profiles are obtained from rotation curves or from gravitational lensing data and irrespective of whether the analysis is performed on individual or co - added rotation curves .    to emphasise the very different ranges of baryonic mass and extent probed by the dsphs and the spiral galaxies in our sample , in figure  [ fig : r83 ] , we compare the relationship between the characteristic baryonic length scale ( @xmath9 ; see above for definitions ) and the stellar mass of dsphs ( estimated from the @xmath109 band luminosity , assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio of unity [ in solar units ] ) , and of spirals .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that burkert halo profiles provide good fits to the dsph kinematic data ( figure  [ fig : burkert_profiles ] ) . in this section",
    "we compare the parameters of the burkert profiles obtained from our dynamical modelling of dsphs with those obtained for spiral galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : rho0r0 ] , we plot @xmath1 versus @xmath0 for the eight dsphs in our sample . remarkably , they lie on the extrapolation to higher central densities of the relation found for spirals .",
    "all these data can be reproduced by the relation @xmath110 + const with @xmath111 .",
    "an even more interesting comparison can be done involving the mean dark matter surface density within the dark halo core radius ( the radius within which the volume density profile of dark matter remains approximately flat ) .",
    "it was recently discovered  @xcite that this quantity @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is constant across a wide range of galaxies of different hubble type and luminosity and that this relation holds also for dsphs , as we confirm in figure  [ fig : sigmacost ] where the data for the dsphs are the results of our burkert halo modelling in the present paper ( in @xcite the dsph halo parameters were obtained via a different approach ) .",
    "we therefore confirm that this relation extends across a luminosity range of 14 magnitudes and spans the whole hubble sequence .",
    "the potential implications of the constancy of @xmath112 are discussed in  @xcite .    in their modelling of spiral galaxies using the urc hypothesis ,",
    "pss found that the parameters of their burkert dm haloes were correlated with those of the luminous matter . in figure",
    "[ fig : rho0rd ] we show the @xmath1 vs @xmath114 relationship for our dsph sample compared with the corresponding relation for spirals from pss . as in the case of the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation in figure  [ fig : rho0r0 ] ,",
    "the dsph data are consistent with the extrapolation of the relation seen in spirals .",
    "the significance of this relation derives from the fact that it links the dm and baryonic matter properties of galaxies on a wide range of length scales : qualitatively , the `` central '' densities of dm haloes increase as the extents of their associated stellar components decrease although the observational evidence for this relation is relatively strong , we stress that its physical interpretation is presently unknown  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for some related discussion of this point ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider explicitly the role played by velocity anisotropy in this result . unsurprisingly , under the assumption of burkert haloes for dsphs the inclusion of velocity anisotropy as a free parameter improves the quality of the dispersion profile fits relative to those obtained for isotropic models .",
    "however , we also find that the scatter in the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation is smaller for anisotropic models  thus the better we reproduce the observed dispersion profiles using burkert haloes , the tighter is the correlation between the halo parameters .    finally , we emphasise that the present results , do not _ require _ the presence of cored haloes in dsphs , nor do they constrain the density and scale lengths of their haloes in a model - independent way . on the other hand , the fact that the dsph kinematics can be reproduced using burkert dm halo profiles whose structural parameters lie on the same scaling relations as those of spirals provides some support for the claim that the mass distributions in dsph galaxies can be understood within the same framework as those of spirals .    -2.8truecm",

    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are the lowest luminosity stellar systems which show evidence of dynamically significant dm .",
    "their physical properties ( luminosity , stellar scale length , baryon fraction ) are typically two orders of magnitude different from those observed for spiral and elliptical galaxies . given these extreme structural properties , an understanding of the formation of dsphs is crucial for the development of a complete picture of galaxy formation .    the main result of this paper is the finding that these galaxies , despite being very distinct in their physical properties from spirals and ellipticals and having a large individual scatter in their baryonic properties , exhibit kinematic properties that can be modelled using dm haloes with the same mass profiles as those which reproduce the rotation curves of spiral galaxies . under the assumption that the haloes of dsphs have burkert profiles , we find that the derived central densities and the core radii are consistent with the extrapolation of the relationship between these quantities seen in spiral galaxies .",
    "conversely a burkert profile with structural parameters predicted by the extrapolation of the relation between halo central density and dm core radius previously found from burkert fits to the kinematics of elliptical and spiral galaxies can account for the observed internal kinematics in dsphs .",
    "this result is intriguing , and could point to a common physical process responsible for the formation of cores in galactic haloes of all sizes , or to a strong coupling between the dm and luminous matter in dsphs .",
    "it is worth noting that a potential connection between spiral galaxies and dsphs does not appear as natural as one between dsphs and other hot , spheroidal systems @xcite .",
    "for example , while the sizes of spiral galaxies are presumably fixed by the angular momentum of the gas from which they form , most of the present - day dsphs show no signs of rotation ( although @xcite have recently found evidence of rotation in the sculptor dsph ) .",
    "however , @xcite have proposed a formation scenario for dsphs in which they are initially low - mass disk galaxies that are subsequently transformed into spheroids by tidal interaction with the milky way .",
    "more recently , such models have been shown to provide reasonable models for the properties of the fornax @xcite and leoi @xcite dsphs .",
    "if the haloes of dsphs do indeed follow the scaling laws defined by more massive disk galaxies , this could lend indirect support to evolutionary histories of this kind .",
    "suggestive evidence of such transformation scenarios is also provided by the discovery of residual disks with spiral structure in luminous dwarf elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster  @xcite .    further dynamical analysis is needed to derive the actual dm distribution in dsph and possibly to estimate their halo core radii .",
    "nevertheless , it interesting to speculate on the possible implications of these scaling laws for our understanding of dm .",
    "warm dark matter has been invoked as a potential solution to the over - prediction of substructure by @xmath115cdm simulations , and to the cusp - core issue  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the existence of scaling relations between the central density and core radius over three orders of magnitude in both quantities would argue against this explanation , unless the warm dm spectrum is extremely fine - tuned .",
    "further , such dm relations can not arise due to either self - annihilation or decay of dm which would predict a narrow range in @xmath1 and no clear correlation of the latter with the core radius .",
    "@xcite argued that the phase - space densities of dm haloes suggested that warm dm ( either collisional or collisionless ) could not be the cause of cores in galaxy haloes on all scales .",
    "these authors suggested a dynamical origin for the cores of larger galaxies .",
    "subsequently , a number of studies have demonstrated that macroscopic core formation in galaxy haloes is possible through the infall of compact baryonic ( or baryon dominated ) sub - clumps  @xcite .",
    "further work is required to explore whether such processes , in conjunction with subsequent star formation and feedback  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can result in universal scaling relations spanning three orders of magnitude in density and length scales .",
    "clearly , a direct kinematic determination of the dark matter profiles of dsphs is essential to confirm the robustness of the scaling relations between the halo parameters .",
    "a number of recent papers have made progress towards this goal in the subset of dsphs which exhibit kinematically distinct sub - populations in their stellar components  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all three analyses favour cored haloes over cusped ones . however , further observational and modelling work is required to constrain the halo profiles more tightly .",
