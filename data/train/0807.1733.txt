    "the spatial pattern of galaxy distribution is not necessarily the same as that of dark matter , and the galaxies are biased tracers of mass @xcite .",
    "the redshift of a galaxy does not purely reflect the hubble flow , and the doppler shift by a peculiar velocity is inevitably added . thus the spatial pattern of clustering of galaxies",

    "the number density of biased objects is a local function of the smoothed density field of mass in eulerian space .",
    "this scheme seems to work as long as the tree - level perturbation theory is adopted @xcite .",
    "however , when loop corrections are considered , there appears a conceptual problem in the local biasing scheme .",
    "it turns out that the one - loop corrections , even on large scales , strongly depend on the artificial smoothing scale @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a way to remove the dependence on the smoothing scale by renormalizing bias parameters is proposed .",
    "while this could be a solution to phenomenologically represent the power spectrum of biased objects @xcite , it is not guaranteed that the procedure actually reflects the physical nature of biasing , since the biasing is more or less a nonlocal process .",
    "it is true that the biasing is difficult to be included exactly in an analytic framework , since the galaxy formation is a highly nonlinear process .",
    "the next best thing is to find a good analytic model . in this respect ,",
    "a plausible model is provided by a halo approach @xcite , which is based on the extended press and schechter ( ps ) model @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the galaxy biasing is described through two steps . in the first step , the formation and clustering of dark matter haloes",
    "are analytically modeled by using the extended ps model .",
    "the spherical collapse model is combined to include the gravitational evolution of halo positions . in the second step ,",
    "the distribution of dark matter or galaxies within haloes is empirically modeled with a number of assumptions @xcite , which include complicated physics such as gas cooling , star formation , feedback effects from supernovae , and so forth @xcite .",
    "while the second step involves many parameters which should be fitted by observations or simulations , the first step is theoretically less uncertain because of its purely gravitational nature . on large scales ,",
    "the second step is not important and the power spectrum of nonlinear objects is approximately the same as that of haloes .",
    "therefore , determining the power spectrum of haloes is an important step toward understanding the nonlinear structure formation and biasing . in the usual halo approach ,",
    "the halo clustering is modeled by linear dynamics and linear bias factors @xcite .",
    "recently , an attempt to incorporate the halo bias with nonlinear perturbation theory in a framework of local biasing scheme has been made @xcite .",
    "there still remains conceptual arbitrariness in the latter formulation , mainly because the halo bias is intrinsically nonlocal in eulerian space and does not fit well into the local eulerian biasing scheme . from the construction ,",
    "the halo bias is local in lagrangian space @xcite , and is therefore nonlocal in eulerian space , because positions of mass and biased objects are displaced by dynamical evolution .    in this paper ,",
    "a natural approach to incorporate the halo bias and redshift - space distortions with nonlinear perturbation theory is newly developed . to account for the locality of halo bias in lagrangian space ,",
    "our formulation is based on the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) @xcite , instead of the standard eulerian perturbation theory ( ept ) . in the original halo approach",
    ", the spherical collapse model is adopted to take into account the dynamical evolution in eulerian space .",
    "however , the dynamical evolution of haloes is more naturally described in the lagrangian picture @xcite .",
    "it is not straightforward to obtain an analytically useful formalism which combines the lpt and the halo approach .",
    "a main obstacle is that the observable quantities reside in eulerian space , while the calculations in lpt directly give lagrangian quantities . in paper",
    "i @xcite , a new approach is developed to overcome this point , partially expanding the lagrangian variables in eulerian space .",
    "the resulting expression contains an infinite series of perturbations in terms of the ept , and this approach offers a simplified technique of resumming cosmological perturbations , such as done in renormalized perturbation theory and its variants @xcite .",
    "while our technique is not suitable enough to describe the fully nonlinear regime which other renormalization techniques aim at , we have shown in paper i that our technique is accurate enough in the quasilinear regime , and most importantly , predictions in redshift space are straightforward . to date , our technique offers the only way of obtaining resummed power spectra in redshift space . in this paper , we show that the local lagrangian bias , including the halo bias , is also straightforward to be incorporated in the approach of paper i , on top of the redshift - space distortions .",
    "the local lagrangian biasing scheme is not equivalent to the local eulerian biasing scheme , and the conceptual problem about the strong dependence on smoothing scales which appears in the local eulerian biasing scheme described above is not present in our lagrangian approach .",

    "[ sec : halolpt ] , those lagrangian bias parameters are calculated from the fundamental concept of the halo model .",

    "our method in this section is not restricted to the halo bias model , and is applicable to any bias defined by a local function of linear density field in lagrangian space .    in the lagrangian approach to track dynamical evolution of cosmological density fields , a set of each trajectory of a mass element ,",

    "we call such biasing scheme a `` local lagrangian bias '' in this paper .",

    "<S> we assume only a fundamental idea of the halo model : haloes form according to the extended press  schechter theory , and the spatial distributions are locally biased in lagrangian space . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for assuming the spherical collapse model to follow the dynamical evolution , which is additionally assumed in standard halo prescriptions . </S>",
    "<S> one - loop corrections to the power spectrum and correlation function of haloes in redshift space are explicitly derived and presented . instead of relying on expensive numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , our approach provides an analytic way of investigating the weakly nonlinear effects , simultaneously including the nonlinear biasing and nonlinear redshift - space distortions . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinearity introduces a weak scale dependence in the halo bias . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence is a smooth function in fourier space , and the bias does not critically change the feature of baryon acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the same feature in the correlation function is less affected by nonlinear effects of biasing . </S>"
