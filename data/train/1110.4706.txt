    "* ) , are now being detected in increasingly larger numbers .",
    "recent results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) , the _ planck _  and",
    "_ fermi _ satellites have established that blazars are the most common type of extragalactic sources found at microwave and energies @xcite .",
    "so far about 3,000 blazars are known @xcite , but their number is steadily growing thanks to the _ fermi _",
    "@xcite , the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the _ planck _  @xcite surveys .",
    "some faint blazars are also being detected as serendipitous sources in _",
    "swift_-xrt images @xcite .",
    "while all blazars share the same property of emitting variable , non - thermal radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , they also display diversity .",
    "namely , they come in two main subclasses , whose major difference is in their optical properties : 1 ) flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , which show strong , broad emission lines in their optical spectrum , just like radio quiet qsos ; and 2 ) bl lacs , which are instead characterized by an optical spectrum , which at most shows weak emission lines , sometimes displays absorption features , and in some cases can be completely featureless . historically , the separation between bl lacs and fsrqs has been made at the ( rather arbitrary ) rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of 5    ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , no evidence for a bimodal distribution in the ew of the broad lines of radio quasars has ever been found and , on the contrary , @xcite pointed out that radio - selected bl lacs were , from the point of view of the emission line properties , very similar to fsrqs but with a stronger continuum .",
    "most bl lacs selected in the x - ray band , on the other hand , had very weak , if any , emission lines , and @xcite , when studying the properties of the x - ray selected _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) sample , had to introduce another criterion to identify bl lacs , this time to separate them from galaxies .",
    "this was based on the ca h&k break , a stellar absorption feature typically found in the spectra of elliptical galaxies . given that its value in non - active ellipticals is @xmath0",
    ", @xcite chose a maximum value of @xmath1 to ensure the presence of a substantial non - thermal continuum superposed to the host galaxy spectrum .",
    "this was later revised to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "blazar classification depends then on the details of their appearance in the optical band where they emit a mix of three types of radiation : 1 ) a non - thermal , jet - related , component ; 2 ) thermal radiation coming from the accretion onto the supermassive black hole and from the broad line region ( at least in most radio - selected sources ) ; 3 ) light from the host ( giant elliptical ) galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] represents these three components as red , blue and orange lines , overlaid to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of four well - known blazars ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the strong non - thermal radiation , the only one that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum , is composed of two basic parts forming two broad humps , the low - energy one attributed to synchrotron radiation , and the high - energy one , usually thought to be due to inverse compton radiation ( see e.g. * ?",
    "the peak of the synchrotron hump ( ) can occur at different frequencies , ranging from about @xmath3  hz to over @xmath4  hz ( see e.g. the cases of 3c 273 or 3c 279 and mkn 501 in fig . [",
    "fig : sed ] ) reflecting the maximum energy at which particles can be accelerated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "blazars where  is lower than @xmath5  hz in their rest frame are called low synchrotron peaked ( lsp ) sources , while those where @xmath5  hz @xmath6  @xmath7  hz , and   @xmath8  hz are called intermediate and high synchrotron peaked ( isp and hsp ) sources respectively @xcite .",
    "this definition extends the original division of bl lacs into lbl and hbl sources first introduced by @xcite .",
    "the large  disparity between lsp and hsp blazars ( up to five orders of magnitude ) is the cause of very large differences between the intensity of the radiation emitted in different energy bands .",
    "for instance , for the same radio flux an hsp source can be a factor of a 100 brighter in the optical band , or even a factor of a 1,000 brighter in the x - ray band , than an lsp blazar .",
    "this induces very strong selection effects in blazar samples discovered in different bands and led to some confusion when comparing , for example , the first radio and x - ray - selected bl lac samples in the early 1990 s .",
    "+    we feel that all the above factors , which play an important role in blazar classification , have not been properly taken into account so far .",
    "the purpose of this paper is then to propose a new hypothesis to explain the existence of apparently different properties of the blazar subclasses , which solves at once many of the open issues of blazar research .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "in fact , while only @xmath19 of wmap5 blazars are bl lacs ( section [ ingredients ] ) , this fraction is instead @xmath20 in the emss complete sample , which includes 41 bl lacs and 15 fsrqs @xcite ; 6 .",
    "_ widely different distributions of the synchrotron peak energy . _",
    "the rest - frame  distribution of fsrqs is strongly peaked at low energies ( @xmath21 @xmath22 hz ) and never reaches very high values ( @xmath23 hz ) independently of the selection method @xcite , while the   distribution of bl lacs is shifted to higher values by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "it can also reach values as high as @xmath24 hz and its shape varies strongly depending on the selection band ( that is radio , x - ray or @xmath25-ray : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of these differences have been explained by so - called unified schemes , which posit that bl lacs and fsrqs are simply fr i and fr ii radio galaxies with their jets forming a small angle with respect to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "( radio galaxies would then be the `` parent '' population of blazars ) .",
    "due to relativistic beaming this has enormous effects on their apparent emitted power and luminosity functions ( lfs ) and can explain their different extended radio powers and , partly , their cosmological evolutions .",
    "however , unified schemes per se can not account for transition objects , and the different evolution of radio and x - ray selected bl lacs and  distributions .",
    "our new hypothesis builds upon unified schemes by adding dilution and strong selection effects as new , vital components .",
    "the existence of bl lac - fsrq transition objects and the recent finding that unresolved radio quasars ( i.e. fsrqs ) appear to be redder than radio quiet agn @xcite suggest that the strong non - thermal jet emission in blazars may have a significant impact on the shape of their blue bump and on the ew of their broad lines .",
    "in particular , given this extra continuum component , the ews of broad - lined blazars ( fsrqs ) should be systematically lower than those of radio - quiet agn .    to test this",
    ", we extracted ew data for samples of radio - quiet qsos and blazars from the sdss dr-7 spectral database . in order to have a sample that is not excessively large but still representative of the entire data set , we considered only radio - quiet qsos with @xmath26 , thus limiting the sample size to about 650 sources . to obtain the ew of a sizable sample of blazars we considered all fsrqs in bzcat with 1.4 ghz flux @xmath27 mjy ( to simulate a radio flux - limited sample ) and in the wmap5 catalogue . for each object in the three samples we retrieved , from the sdss on - line system , the line measurements parameters ( e.g. ew , @xmath28 of the fit etc . )",
    "of the strongest emission lines in quasar spectra , that is ly@xmath29 , c  iv , c  iii , mg  ii , h@xmath30 , h@xmath29 .",
    "details on the fitting algorithm can be found at the sdss website . to avoid problematic cases , for our analysis we considered only sdss fits to emission lines with @xmath31 .",
    "figure [ fig : ewrlrq ] shows the distribution of the ew of the mgii emission line , for which we have better statistics , for the sample of radio quiet sdss qsos ( 663 objects ) , bzcat ( 126 objects ) and wmap5 ( 35 objects ) fsrqs .",
    "the ew of both blazar samples is smaller than that of radio quiet qsos , with median values respectively equal to 16.4 ( bzcat ) , 14 ( wmap5 ) , and 18.4   ( radio - quiet qsos ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test gives a probability @xmath32 that both fsrq samples have the same distribution as that of radio - quiet agn .",
    "moreover , we found that this dilution increases further ( i.e. the median ew gets smaller ) if we make a cut at higher radio fluxes in the bzcat fsrqs .",
    "similar results were obtained for the other emission lines .",
    "this demonstrates that the broad lines of blazars are significantly diluted compared to those of radio quiet qsos .",
    "the mean absolute magnitudes of the blazar and radio - quiet samples agree within @xmath33 magnitudes , which means that the difference can not be due to the well - known anti - correlation between ew and absolute magnitude , the so - called `` baldwin effect '' @xcite .",
    "we note that a number of papers have stated that the optical spectra of radio - quiet and radio - loud qsos are not significantly different ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . however , the radio - loud samples on which this conclusion was based were still optically selected and required the presence of a uv excess and/or strong emission lines .",
    "therefore , these radio - loud samples were biased towards objects with strong blue bumps .",
    "the considerations made in the previous sections lead us to propose a new , very simple scenario where the observed blazar optical spectrum is the result of a combination of an intrinsic ew distribution and the effects of three components : a non - thermal , jet related one , a thermal one due to the accretion disk , and emission from the host galaxy .",
    "different mixes of these components determine the appearance of the optical spectrum and therefore the classification of sources in fsrqs ( dominated by strong lines ) , bl lacs ( with diluted , weak lines , if a standard accretion disk is present ) , and radio - galaxies ( where the host galaxy swamps both the thermal and non - thermal nuclear emission present in blazars ) .",
    "the other novel component is a single lf whose evolution depends on radio power .",
    "this idea was tested through extensive monte carlo simulations , as described below .",
    "our simulations include the following ingredients , which we kept as simple as possible and tied as much as possible to observational data :    1 .",

    "we extend on the work of @xcite , which was based on wmap3 , and define a flux - limited sample of high galactic latitude sources ( @xmath35 jy , @xmath36 ) including 161 fsrqs , 29 bl lacs , and 10 blazars of unknown type . by applying a maximum likelihood technique to the wmap5 blazars ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the agreement is clearly good reproducing well the fact that bl lacs have much higher  values than fsrqs .",
    "the existence of a strong anti - correlation between bolometric luminosity and , known as the  blazar sequence \" has been the subject of intense discussions since its first proposal by @xcite and @xcite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "figure [ fig : sequence ] shows our radio and x - ray selected simulated blazars in the log ( )  log(@xmath100l@xmath101(5 ghz ) ) plane .",
    "this reproduces the famous plot used by @xcite to propose the existence of the blazar sequence based on the correlation shown in this plane by fsrqs and bl lacs discovered in shallow radio surveys ( 2 and 1 jy samples ) and bl lacs found in the x - ray flux limited _ einstein _ slew survey ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "indeed , considered together the simulated radio and x - ray selected blazars display a broad correlation with radio selected fsrqs and bl lacs ( red open squares and open circles ) mostly filling the top left and central part of the diagram and x - ray selected bl lacs ( green open circles ) mostly confined to the lower right corner of the plot .",
    "this particular positioning of the points ( bright fsrqs of the lsp type vs. fainter hsp bl lacs ) is not due to any intrinsic correlation between luminosity and  but is instead the result of a selection effect resulting from the fact that bright radio sources are mostly drawn from the high end of the blazar luminosity function , while bl lacs in x - ray flux limited samples are mostly high  sources ( intrinsically rare ) drawn from the low end of the luminosity function where the source density is largest .",
    "the most important difference between fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] and the diagram of @xcite is in the high - luminosity - high  part , where most of the radio and x - ray selected objects with no redshift ( red and green filled points ) are located .",
    "these sources could not be plotted by @xcite since the luminosity of blazars without redshift can not be estimated .",
    "this left the top right part of the @xcite diagram empty , thus contributing to make the displayed data look like a power sequence .",
    "to assess the dependence of our results on the adopted lf and evolution , we have made the following two checks : first , we varied their input values by @xmath103 adopting @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 ( luminosity peak at @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ( luminosity peak at @xmath111 ) ; second , we used as an alternative lf the sum of the bl lac and fsrq lfs based on the beaming model of @xcite ( converted to @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) assuming , for consistency with the way they were derived , a pure luminosity evolution of the type @xmath112 $ ] , where @xmath113 is the look - back time .",
    "a value of @xmath114 , which is consistent with the evolution of dxrbs fsrqs and bl lacs combined ( based on the samples in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was also assumed .",
    "we have also checked the dependence of our results on the assumed value of the doppler factor , running the simulation with values of @xmath115 ranging from 5 to 20 , and we have also considered the case of a dependence of @xmath75 on radio power as suggested by some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite , who studied a complete sample , have not been able to confirm such a correlation .    in all cases our main results , that is the prevalence of fsrqs and bl lacs in radio and x - ray selected samples respectively , the higher redshifts and evolution of fsrqs as compared to bl lacs , and the no evolution of x - ray selected bl lacs , were confirmed , which shows that they are independent of the details of the lf and evolution .",
    "we also modified our assumption that standard accretion disks are associated only with sources having an fr ii parent but the simulations we obtained were inconsistent with observations .",
    "in fact , even if the relatively small fraction of @xmath116 of objects with fr i parents are randomly assigned an accretion disk and allowed to evolve , x - ray selected bl lacs reach too high values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , 0.58 and 0.91 respectively , which are incompatible with observations .",
    "so far , blazars have been largely discovered in the radio , @xmath119-wave , x - ray or bands .",
    "we have shown that the wide diversity of  observed in blazars results in strong differences in the observed flux at radio or x - ray frequencies ( up to three orders of magnitudes ) causing severe selection effects in surveys performed in these energy bands .",
    "this , combined with the fact that blazars are always identified on the basis of their optical spectrum , which reflects a mix of non - thermal , thermal , and host galaxy emission , has been the origin of a number of enduring open issues about the nature of blazars .",
    "a long - standing blazar puzzle is the difference in redshift distribution and cosmological evolution between fsrqs and bl lacs , selected both in the radio and in the x - ray band .",
    "bl lacs are mostly located at low redshifts and exhibit moderate , or even negative , evolution , while fsrqs evolve strongly just like radio quiet qsos and show a redshift distribution that peaks at @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "our simulations reproduce quite well both of these findings ( see fig . [",
    "fig : wmap_red ] and tables [ tab : radiosim ] and [ tab : xsim ] ) implying that they are due to heavy selection effects .",
    "most of the simulated bl lacs found in radio surveys are luminous objects with broad lines that are diluted by non - thermal radiation beyond the 5    ew limit ( many of them just below , thus allowing a measurement of their redshift ) , while the bl lacs found in simulated x - ray surveys typically show high  values ( and therefore are x - ray bright ) and are drawn from the low - power end of the radio luminosity function where non - evolving fr is are preferentially found ( section [ ingredients ] ) .",
    "we note that the  of radio selected bl lacs is not too different from that of fsrqs , while the  of x - ray selected bl lacs is significantly lower , as found in real surveys ( section [ radio_survey ] ) .",
    "another interesting outcome of our simulations is the fact that x - ray selected bl lacs with progressively larger values of  are characterized by lower and lower values of  ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : xsim ] ) .",
    "this is in full agreement with the puzzling , and so far unexplained , results of @xcite and of @xcite who reported that the  of bl lacs is a function of their x - ray - to - radio flux ratio .",
    "recent results , based on radio and @xmath25-ray surveys , have revealed that bl lacs , on average , display a distribution of  energies , which is shifted to values higher than those of fsrqs @xcite , expanding on the well - known fact that high  objects ( hsps ) are always bl lacs .",
    "this experimental difference is well reproduced in our simulations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : radio_nupeak ] ) which give @xmath121log()@xmath62 = 12.9 for fsrqs and @xmath122log()@xmath62 = 14.1 for bl lacs for the case of a radio survey .",
    "this distinction is due to the fact that blazars with higher  values produce more non - thermal optical light than low  sources , diluting more easily the broad line component , and are therefore classified more frequently as bl lac objects .",
    "we note that this has been interpreted in the literature as an intrinsic physical difference between lsp ( detected mostly in the radio band ) and hsp ( detected mostly in the x - ray and band ) blazars due to the fact that hsps are observationally characterized by a low intrinsic power and external radiation field , given their very weak or absent emission lines . as a consequence",
    ", cooling was thought to be less dramatic in hsp allowing particles to reach energies high enough to produce synchrotron emission well into the x - ray band @xcite . in our scenario , instead , all sources have exactly the same chance of being hsp or lsp ( that is , the value of @xmath55 is drawn from the distribution shown in fig . [",
    "fig : gammae ] _ independently _ of luminosity ) and the very different  distributions observed in radio and x - ray surveys arise from the strong selection effect discussed in section [ sec : seq ] and the emission line dilution mentioned above .",
    "our simulations predict the existence of a significant number of bl lacs with redshift that can not be measured , which occurs when both  and radio power are so large that dilution becomes extreme .",
    "for example , @xmath123 of our simulated sources with  @xmath8 hz and @xmath124 w / hz have no redshift .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that most bl lacs in current  selected samples have no measured redshift , as _ fermi _ is known to preferentially select high  bl lacs @xcite .",
    "this effect is also clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] where most of the simulated blazars with no measurable redshift ( filled circles with light colors ) occupy the top right part of the diagram . fig .",
    "[ fig : zdistofnoredshiftsources ] shows the intrinsic redshift distribution of these featureless bl lacs for the case of our simulation of a radio flux density limited survey .",
    "@xcite had originally suggested that the absence of broad lines in bl lacs was due to a very bright , doppler - boosted synchrotron continuum . in the years following that paper observations of various bl lacs , mostly selected in the x - ray band , showed that in many cases their optical spectrum was not swamped by a non - thermal component , as host galaxy features were very visible , and it was thought that most bl lacs had intrinsically weak lines .",
    "we have shown here that these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive and indeed are both viable , depending on radio power and , therefore , on the band of selection .",
    "one important consequence of our scenario is that objects so far classified as bl lacs on the basis of their _ observed _ weak , or undetectable , emission lines belong to two physically different classes : intrinsically weak lined objects , whose parents are lergs / fr is ( more common in x - ray selected samples , since they reach lower radio powers ) and heavily diluted broad - lined sources , which are beamed hergs / fr iis ( more frequent in radio selected samples ) .",
    "therefore , while the non - thermal engine is probably the same , the thermal one is obviously different .",
    "this solves at once the issue of the fsrq / bl lac transition objects and of the many differences between bl lacs selected in the radio and x - ray bands , which include line strength , extended radio emission and morphology , and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this hypothesis , which explains also many other open issues of blazar research , is directly testable .",
    "our simulations , in fact , imply that the majority of sources in high - flux density radio - selected samples are identified as bl lacs only because all lines have ew  @xmath125    _ in the optical observing window_. these sources should show a strong ( ew @xmath126  ) h@xmath29 line if observed in the near or mid - infrared , since this is the strongest emission line , and would then be considered fsrqs , which reinforces our point on the very strong effect that line dilution has on blazar classification .",
    "herg / fr ii bl lacs , then , should be easily recognizable through infrared spectroscopy .",
    "these sources , as expected , are also more dominant at higher radio powers : for example , according to our radio simulation the fraction of bl lacs with standard accretion disks is only @xmath127 for @xmath128 w / hz but becomes @xmath129 above this value .",
    "this also means that fainter radio - selected samples of bl lacs should be more and more similar to x - ray selected ones , apart from their  values , since higher  are easier to detect in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "the implications of our hypothesis for unified schemes is quite straightforward : the parent population of bl lacs need to include both lergs / fr is and hergs / fr iis , while that of fsrqs is made up of hergs / fr iis only .",
    "this should have only a small effect , for example , on the lf fitting done by @xcite , as herg / fr ii bl lacs make up the high - power end of the radio lf while most of the number density comes from lerg / fr i bl lacs .",
    "our new scenario has strong implications on blazar classification as well .",
    "if the relevant physical distinction for radio sources is between lergs ( mostly fr is ) and hergs ( fr iis ) , for most purposes then ( lfs , evolution , etc . ) herg / fr ii bl lacs should be simply grouped with fsrqs .",
    "how does one distinguish in practice herg / fr",
    "ii bl lacs from lerg / fr i bl lacs ?",
    "this is simple in the presence of _ any _ ( even weak ) broad lines or for transition objects .",
    "in other cases ( e.g. completely featureless spectrum or in presence of absorption features ) there is no easy way to distinguish between the two subclasses although , for example , radio power and/or morphology could help .",
    "given the paucity of known lerg / fr is at relative high redshifts , x - ray selected ( and also fainter radio - selected ) bl lac samples are also useful in selecting such sources , which are very relevant also for the study of the so - called `` agn feedback '' and the role that agn radio emission plays in galaxy evolution through the so - called `` radio - mode '' accretion @xcite .",
    "it should also be clear that bl lacs can be used to study the broader issue of the relationship between lergs and hergs , including their evolution .",
    "a by - product of our simulations has also been the realization that some sources classified as radio - galaxies do _ not _ have their jets oriented at large angles with respect to the line of sight , as expected , but are instead moderately beamed blazars with their non - thermal emission swamped by the galaxy ( note that none of these objects has a standard accretion disk ) .",
    "these sources , which are all local ( @xmath130 at @xmath131 ) should be recognizable by their blazar - like seds and indeed some of them have already been identified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed a new classification scheme to divide bl lacs from fsrqs , which is based on the broad line region ( blr ) luminosity in eddington units and set at a dividing value of @xmath132 .",
    "this turns out to be also the value , which separates radiatively efficient ( i.e. , standard accretion disks ) from radiatively inefficient ( i.e. , adafs ) regimes , and therefore coincides with our herg / fr ii ",
    "lerg / fr i division .",
    "therefore , @xcite are also suggesting that herg / fr ii bl lacs belong with the fsrqs .",
    "we have tackled the open issue of the relationship between the various blazar subclasses , and of the consequences of selection effects , through extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "our approach is based on robust observational input , and on various results obtained by many authors over the past 20 years or so , which had never before been put together in a comprehensive way .",
    "we kept the number of assumptions and parameters to a minimum so as to draw robust conclusions .",
    "our starting point are two populations of high - excitation , high radio - power , evolving and low - excitation , low - power , non - evolving radio sources .",
    "to these we add : an homogeneous synchrotron self - compton component with a distribution of electron lorentz factors peaked at relatively low values , an optical / uv quasar template , the ew distributions of the main broad lines observed in radio - quiet quasars , a distribution of disk / jet ratios , and finally an elliptical host galaxy .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we explain the main properties of all blazar subclasses , namely fsrqs and bl lacs selected in the radio and x - ray band .",
    "our simulations reproduce well the prevalence of fsrqs and bl lacs in radio and x - ray selected samples respectively , the higher redshifts , evolution and lower  of fsrqs as compared to bl lacs , the non evolution of x - ray selected bl lacs , and the main differences between radio and x - ray - selected bl lacs in a manner that does not dependent significantly on the adopted lf and evolutionary details ; 2 .",
    "objects classified until now as bl lacs on the basis of their _ observed _ weak , or undetectable , emission lines actually belong to two physically different classes : most bl lacs in high flux density , radio - selected samples are actually beamed radio quasars with their emission lines heavily diluted by the non - thermal continuum and for all purposes should then be grouped with fsrqs .",
    "infrared spectroscopy should reveal in many such sources the presence of strong ( ew @xmath126   ) h@xmath29 ; most bl lacs selected in the x - ray band are instead intrinsically weak - lined , low - excitation radio galaxies with a strong non - thermal , jet component ; 3 .",
    "there are only two main intrinsic blazar types : low - ionization ( mostly beamed fr is ) and high - ionization ( beamed fr iis ) ones .",
    "all other classifications and classes proposed so far are not physically relevant and are simply due to severe selection effects and different relative strengths of the non - thermal , thermal , and galaxy components , which make up blazars optical emission ; 4 .",
    "some sources classified as radio - galaxies on the basis of their optical properties are instead moderately beamed blazars ( that is , sources with their jets forming a small angle with respect to the line of sight ) with their non - thermal emission swamped by the host galaxy .",
    "some of these sources have already been recognized from their seds ; 5 .",
    "our simulations show that the purported correlation between luminosity and , the so - called `` blazar sequence '' , is likely a selection effect resulting from comparing shallow radio surveys with shallow x - ray surveys .",
    "we also show that blazars with featureless optical spectra , and therefore without a redshift determination , are mostly high luminosity ",
    "high  sources , a type of blazar that should not exist in the `` blazar sequence '' scenario .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of redshift in the majority of bl lacs in current selected samples , as _ fermi _ is known to preferentially select high  bl lacs ; 6 .",
    "the topics addressed in this paper are not relevant only to blazars but are also related to the broader issues of low - ionization radio galaxies and radio - mode `` agn feedback '' .",
    "in this paper we limited our simulations to the radio and the x - ray bands where ssc is a fair approximation of the observed non - thermal emission .",
    "the properties of  detected blazars are instead not consistent with simple ssc models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and almost half of the radio and x - ray selected lsp blazars are quiet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the present approach must therefore be integrated with additional information about the properties of the inverse compton emission before it can be used to simulate surveys .",
    "we are planning to extend our simulations to the band by taking into account the recent results of @xcite who determined the properties of blazar samples selected in different bands .",

    "<S> we propose a scenario where blazars are classified as flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , bl lacs , low synchrotron , or high synchrotron peaked objects according to a varying mix of the doppler boosted radiation from the jet , the emission from the accretion disk , the broad line region , and the light from the host galaxy . in this framework the peak energy of the synchrotron power ( ) in blazars is independent of source type and of radio luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we test this new approach , which builds upon unified schemes , using extensive monte carlo simulations and show that it can provide simple answers to a number of long - standing issues including , amongst others , the different cosmological evolution of bl lacs selected in the radio and x - ray bands , the larger  values observed in bl lacs , the fact that high synchrotron peaked blazars are always of the bl lac type , and the existence of fsrq / bl lac transition objects . </S>",
    "<S> objects so far classified as bl lacs on the basis of their _ observed _ weak , or undetectable , emission lines are of two physically different classes : intrinsically weak lined objects , more common in x - ray selected samples , and heavily diluted broad lined sources , more frequent in radio selected samples , which explains some of the confusion in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that strong selection effects are the main cause of the diversity observed in radio and x - ray samples , and that the correlation between luminosity and , that led to the proposal of the `` blazar sequence '' , is also a selection effect arising from the comparison of shallow radio and x - ray surveys , and to the fact that high  -  high radio power objects have never been considered because their redshift is not measurable .    </S>",
