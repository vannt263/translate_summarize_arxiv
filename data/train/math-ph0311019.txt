    "one of the most interesting features of many nonlinear evolution equations is the spontaneous onset of singularities in solutions starting from smooth initial data .",
    "such a phenomenon , usually called `` blowup '' , has been a subject of intensive studies in many fields ranging from fluid dynamics to general relativity . given a nonlinear evolution equation , the key question is whether or not the blowup can occur for some initial data . once the existence of blowup is established for a particular equation , many further questions come up , such as : when and where does the blowup occur ?",
    "what is the character of blowup and is it universal ? what happens at the threshold of blowup ?    in this paper we consider these questions for the simplest nonlinear generalization of the free wave equation : the semilinear wave equation with the power nonlinearity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an odd integer .",
    "the sign of the nonlinear term corresponds to focusing , that is it tends to magnify the amplitude of the wave .",
    "if @xmath4 is small this term is negligible and the evolution is essentially linear ( actually one has scattering for @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath4 is large the dispersive effect of the linear wave operator may be overcome by the focusing effect of the nonlinearity and a singularity can form . in fact , it is known that if the energy @xmath6 = \\int_{r^3 }   \\left ( u_t^2 + ( \\nabla u)^2 - \\frac{1}{p+1 } u^{p+1 } \\right ) d^3 x\\ ] ] is negative , then a singularity must form in a finite time @xcite .",
    "this theorem says only that the solution can not be continued beyond certain time but it gives no information on how the solution looks like as it approaches the blowup time .",
    "probably the best way to learn about the character of singularities is to look at explicit singular solutions . for equation ( [ eqgen ] )",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath7^{\\frac{1}{p-1 } } , \\quad \\alpha=\\frac{2}{p-1 } ,   \\quad t>0,\\ ] ] is the exact solution which blows up as @xmath8 .",
    "this solution is obtained by neglecting the laplacian in ( [ eqgen ] ) and solving the corresponding ordinary differential equation @xmath9 .",
    "the question is how typical this explicit singular behaviour is .",
    "there are several ways to approach this problem . on the analytical side",
    "there are fuchsian methods developed by kichenassamy @xcite which allow to construct open sets of initial data which blow up on a prescribed spacelike hypersurface with the leading order asymptotic behaviour given by the solution @xmath10 @xcite . on the heuristic side",
    "there are numerical and perturbative methods which , albeit non - rigorous , allow to gain a more detailed information about the character of blowup . in this paper",
    "we take the latter approach .",
    "our main goal was to show that the solution @xmath10 determines the leading order asympotics of blowup for generic large initial data and the spatial pattern of convergence to this solution can be described in terms of the least damped eigenmodes of the linearized perturbations about @xmath10 .",
    "we did this in the spherically symmetric case @xmath11 for three representative values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these values corresponds to three different classes of criticality of equation ( [ eqgen ] ) . to see this , notice that equation ( [ eqgen ] ) has the scaling symmetry :",
    "if @xmath15 is the solution , so is @xmath16 under this transformation the energy scales as @xmath17 = l^{\\beta } e[u ] , \\qquad \\beta = \\frac{p-5}{p-1},\\ ] ] hence equation ( [ eqgen ] ) is subcritical for @xmath12 ( @xmath18 ) , critical for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and supercritical for @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "since the energy ( [ energy ] ) is not positive definite , this distinction is not very important as far as the generic character of blowup is concerned , however , as we shall show below , it is relevant for understanding the behaviour of solutions at the threshold for blowup .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss self - similar solutions of equation ( [ eqspher ] ) and analyze their stability . in section 3",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations of blowup and demonstrate the universality of the blowup profile .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss the behaviour of solutions at the threshold for blowup .",
    "in order to set the stage for the discussion of singularity formation we first discuss self - similar solutions of equation ( [ eqspher ] ) . as we shall see below these solutions play an important role in the process of blowup . by definition ,",
    "self - similar are invariant under rescaling ( [ scale ] ) , hence in the spherically symmetric case they have the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a positive constant , clearly allowed by time translation invariance .",
    "note that each self - similar solution , if it is regular for @xmath25 , provides an explicit example of a singularity developing at @xmath26 in finite time @xmath24 from nonsingular initial data - for this reason we shall refer to @xmath24 as the blowup time . substituting",
    "the ansatz ( [ ssansatz ] ) into equation ( [ eqspher ] ) one gets the ordinary differential equation for the similarity profile @xmath27 @xmath28 we consider this equation inside the past light cone of the blowup point @xmath29 , that is in the interval @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to see that for any @xmath1 equation ( [ eqss ] ) has the constant solution @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{p-1}}.\\ ] ] of course , this solution corresponds exactly to the solution @xmath10 of the original equation ( [ eqspher ] ) .",
    "it turns out that besides this trivial solution , for some values of @xmath1 there exist also nontrivial profiles .",
    "the existence of such solutions can be proved by the shooting technique which goes as follows .",
    "one first shows that at the both endpoints of the interval @xmath32 there exist one - parameter families of local analytic solutions which behave , respectively , as @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are free parameters . having that , the strategy for finding solutions which are regular in the interval @xmath37 is simple : one shoots the solution satisfying the initial condition ( [ local1 ] ) at @xmath38 towards the center and adjusts the parameter @xmath35 so that @xmath39 . applying this technique bizo and",
    "maison @xcite proved existence for a countable set of parameters @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) which determine analytic similarity profiles @xmath42 for @xmath12 and all odd @xmath43 .",
    "the first few similarity profiles @xmath42 for @xmath12 and @xmath44 are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the behaviour of solutions @xmath45 outside the past light cone , that is for @xmath46 , depends on @xmath1 .",
    "one can show ( see @xcite ) that for @xmath12 all @xmath47 solutions become singular outside the past light cone , namely @xmath48 in contrast , for @xmath49 all solutions @xmath42 remain regular outside the past light cone .",
    "0.15 cm     0.15 cm    for @xmath19 there are no nontrivial self - similar solutions - this can be showed as follows . consider the function @xmath50 \\rho^3 u^2 +      \\frac{1}{p+1 } \\rho^3 u^{p+1}.\\ ] ] this function was introduced by kavian and weissler @xcite in their study of equation ( [ eqspher ] ) .",
    "they showed that @xmath51 for @xmath19 , hence in this case @xmath52 is the first integral of equation ( [ eqss ] ) . since @xmath53",
    ", it follows that @xmath54 , from which one gets @xmath55 .",
    "this coincides with @xmath56 so by uniqueness we conclude that @xmath56 is the only similarity profile .    in order to determine the role of self - similar solutions in dynamics it is essential to analyze their stability . to this end",
    "we define the slow time @xmath57 and rewrite equation ( [ eqspher ] ) in terms of the new variable @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 we get @xmath60 the advantage of this formulation is that self - similar solutions of equation ( [ eqspher ] ) correspond now to @xmath61-independent solutions of equation ( [ css ] ) while the asymptotics of blowup corresponds to the behaviour at @xmath62 . in order to determine the linear stability of solutions @xmath45 we seek solutions of ( [ css ] ) in the form @xmath63 .",
    "after linearization we get the quadratic eigenvalue problem @xmath64 \\xi = 0.\\ ] ] let us consider first the stability of the constant solution @xmath56 . in this case equation ( [ eigen_fn ] )",
    "becomes @xmath65 \\xi ' +        \\left [ \\frac{2(p+1)}{p-1 } - \\frac{p+3}{p-1 } \\",

    "it corresponds to the gauge mode which is due to the freedom of choosing the blow - up time @xmath24 .",
    "all the remaining eigenvalues are negative hence for any @xmath1 the solution @xmath56 is linearly stable .",
    "this suggests that it can appear as an attractor in generic evolution .",
    "since we do not know the solutions @xmath42 with @xmath47 in closed form , their spectrum of linear perturbations can be computed only numerically .",
    "our numerical calculations indicate that the solution @xmath42 has @xmath76 unstable modes ( apart from the spurious unstable mode corresponding to the change of blowup time ) . for this reason",
    "the solutions with @xmath47 are not expected to appear in generic evolution .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the solution @xmath77 with one unstable mode appears as the codimension - one attractor in the evolution of specially prepared initial data .",
    "having learned about the stability of the solution @xmath10 we are now prepared to interpret the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the main goal of these simulations was to determine the asymptotics of blowup .",
    "we solved equation ( [ eqspher ] ) using the method of lines which was fourth order accurate in space and time .",
    "we found that for sufficiently large initial data the amplitude @xmath78 becomes unbounded in a finite time @xmath24 for some @xmath79 .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath80^{\\frac{1}{p-1}},\\ ] ] which confirms the expectation that the solution @xmath10 determines the leading order asymptotics of blowup . in this section",
    "we wish to show that if the blowup point is at the center , i.e. @xmath81 , then the spatial pattern of the developing singularity can be described in terms of the least damped eigenmodes about @xmath10 .",
    "using the results of linear stability analysis we can represent the asymptotic approach to @xmath56 for @xmath62 ( i.e. @xmath8 ) by the formula @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the eigenmodes corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath84 , respectively and @xmath85 are the expansion coefficients . keeping the first two least damped eigenmodes we obtain the following expansions in terms of original variables ( using the abbreviation @xmath86 )    @xmath12 : :    @xmath87 @xmath19 : :    @xmath88 @xmath44 : :    @xmath89    we claim that these formulae describe accurately the convergence to the blowup profile inside the past light cone of the blowup point @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical evidence for this assertion is summarized in figures 3 and 4 in the case @xmath12 ( throughout this section we use the case @xmath12 for illustration - analogous results hold for @xmath19 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "0.15 cm     0.15 cm     0.10 cm    as shown in figure 4 the formula ( [ expan_3 ] ) accurately describes the blowup profile for large @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath90 close to @xmath24 ) not only inside the light cone but even slightly beyond .",
    "however , the expansions ( [ expan_3]-[expan_7 ] ) are expected to break down when the linearization is no longer valid ; that is , if @xmath91 . in this transition region",
    "the leading order approximation for any @xmath1 reads @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 defined as in ( [ explicit ] ) and @xmath95 equal to the coefficient of the quadratic term of the @xmath96 eigenfunction .",
    "this indicates the parabolic scaling @xmath97 substituting this ansatz into equation ( [ eqspher ] ) and dropping the laplacian ( which becomes negligible as @xmath98 ) we get the ordinary differential equation @xmath99 which has a one - parameter family of regular solutions @xmath100 comparing ( [ parabolic_0 ] ) with ( [ parabolic_1 ] ) and ( [ parabolic_sol ] ) we get the matching condition @xmath101 which e.g. for @xmath12 gives @xmath102 . the numerical confirmation of this prediction is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we remark that the above result follows immediately from the fuchsian analysis which predicts the leading order asymptotics on a spacelike blow - up curve @xmath103 in the form @xmath104 the blowup time is defined as @xmath105 . assuming that this infimum is attained at @xmath26",
    ", we have @xmath106 for some @xmath107 . inserting this into ( [ fuchs_form ] ) we get @xmath108 which reproduces ( [ parabolic_1 ] ) and ( [ parabolic_sol ] ) .",
    "0.10 cm    as the coefficient @xmath35 becomes negative , the first blowup occurs at @xmath109 . by fine - tuning initial data to the transition between the blowup at @xmath81 and the blowup at @xmath109 we set @xmath110 which means that the first eigenmode in the expansion ( [ eigen_exp ] ) is tuned away . for such codimension - one initial data the formula ( [ parabolic_0 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath111 where the coefficient @xmath112 is equal to the quartic term of the @xmath113 eigenfuction .",
    "this gives another scaling ( see figure 6 ) @xmath114 where @xmath115",
    "since solutions of equation ( [ eqspher ] ) disperse for small initial data and blow up for large initial data , there arises a natural question what happens in between . in the following the boundary between initial data that lead to dispersion and initial data that lead to singularity formation",
    "will be referred to as the threshold for blowup .",
    "the determination of the threshold for blowup and the corresponding dynamics is of great interest in physical models which predict formation of singularities , for example in general relativity .",
    "this issue can be studied numerically as follows .",
    "consider a one - parameter family of initial data @xmath116 such that the corresponding solutions exist globally if the parameter @xmath1 is small or blow up if the parameter @xmath1 is large .",
    "then , along the curve @xmath116 there must be a critical value @xmath117 ( or an interval @xmath118 $ ] ) which separates these two scenarios .",
    "given two values @xmath1 small and @xmath1 large , it is straightforward ( in principle but not always in practice ) to find @xmath117 by bisection . repeating this procedure for different interpolating families of initial data",
    "one obtains a set of critical data which by construction belongs to the threshold for blowup . having that",
    ", one can look in more detail at the evolution of critical data .",
    "the precisely critical data can not be prepared numerically but in practice it is sufficient to follow the evolution of marginally critical data .",
    "typically , one finds that the evolution of such data has a universal ( that is family independent ) transient phase during which the solution approaches a kind of an intermediate attractor .",
    "0.15 cm    the heuristic explanation of this behaviour is sketched in figure 7 . according to this picture the threshold for blowup",
    "is given by the codimension - one stable manifold @xmath119 of an intermediate attractor @xmath120 , called the critical solution .",
    "the critical initial data corresponding to intersections of @xmath119 with different interpolating one - parameter families of initial data , converge ) , the convergence ( which is due to radiation of energy to infinity ) is always meant in the local sense .",
    "] along @xmath119 towards the critical solution .",
    "the marginally critical data , by continuity , initially remain close to @xmath119 and approach @xmath120 for intermediate times but eventually are repelled from its vicinity along the one - dimensional unstable manifold . within this picture",
    "the universality of marginally critical dynamics in the intermediate asymptotics follows immediately from the fact that the same unstable mode dominates the evolution of all solutions .",
    "the nature of the critical solution itself depends on a model - typically @xmath120 is a static or a self - similar solution with exactly one unstable mode .    to apply the numerical strategy outlined above we solved equation ( [ eqspher ] ) for various one - parameter families of initial conditions which interpolate between small and large initial data .",
    "the results described below do not depend on the particular choice of the family  for concreteness we present them for the initial data of the form @xmath121 , \\quad u_t(0,r)=0,\\ ] ] with adjustable amplitude @xmath122 and fixed parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "since the initial data are time symmetric , the initial profile splits into ingoing and outgoing waves travelling with approximately unit speed . except for very large initial amplitudes",
    "for which the singularity forms very fast , before the separation into ingoing and outgoing wave occurs , the evolution of the outgoing wave does not affect the singularity formation so we shall ignore it .",
    "the behaviour of the ingoing wave depends on the amplitude @xmath122 . for large amplitudes",
    "we observe the formation of singularity at some @xmath109 in finite time @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath122 decreases , the blowup point @xmath125 decreases also and reaches depends on @xmath1 . as @xmath126 from above ,",
    "the function @xmath127 decreases continuously to zero for @xmath12 but for @xmath128 it jumps from some @xmath109 to @xmath81 . ]",
    "@xmath81 for some value @xmath129 . as we keep decreasing the amplitude below @xmath129 we eventually reach a critical value @xmath130 below which solutions do not blowup up . the asymptotic pattern of blowup described in the previous section applies to solutions with amplitudes @xmath131 .",
    "the character of the threshold for blowup at @xmath130 depends on @xmath1 so we discuss three values of @xmath1 separately .",
    "in this case we identify the critical solution as the @xmath133 self - similar solution @xmath134 the numerical evidence for the criticality of solution @xmath135 is presented in figure 8 .",
    "0.10 cm     0.10 cm    according to the picture of critical behaviour described above , the marginally critical solutions have the following form in the intermediate asymptotics @xmath136 where @xmath96 is the single unstable mode about @xmath135 with the eigenvalue @xmath137 .",
    "a small constant @xmath138 , which is the only vestige of initial data , quantifies an admixture of the unstable mode  for precisely critical data @xmath139 .",
    "we show in figure 9 that the departure from the critical solution proceeds in agreement with equation ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "we know from section 2 that in this case there are no nontrivial self - similar solutions . however , since for @xmath19 the energy is scale invariant , static solutions with finite energy are possible .",
    "indeed , it is well known that equation ( [ eqspher ] ) has the finite energy solution @xmath141 rescalings of this solution generate the orbit of static solutions @xmath142 . to determine the linear stability of this solution we plug @xmath143 into ( [ eqspher ] ) and linearize .",
    "we get the eigenvalue problem in the form of the radial schdinger equation @xmath144 notice that the perturbation induced by rescaling @xmath145 satisfies equation ( [ st_eigen ] ) for @xmath146 .",
    "this is so called zero mode . since the zero mode has one node , it follows by the standard result from sturm - liouville theory that the potential @xmath147 has exactly one bound state , @xmath148 , which means that there is exactly one growing mode @xmath149 , where @xmath150",
    ". numerical calculation gives @xmath151 .",
    "thus , according to our preceding discussion , the solution @xmath152 is a candidate for a critical solution . to verify this",
    ", szpak  @xcite has investigated the nonlinear evolution of the growing mode . for initial data of the form @xmath153 , @xmath154 , he found that , depending on the sign of the amplitude @xmath155 , the solution either disperses or blows up in finite time .",
    "this confirmed the expectation that in fact @xmath152 is the critical solution sitting on the saddle separating blowup from dispersal . applying bisection to the family of initial data ( [ gauss4 ] )",
    "we have obtained the solution @xmath152 as the intermediate attractor with pretty long lifetime .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details , in particular the analysis of convergence to @xmath152 .",
    "in this case we were not able to identify a critical solution because of two reasons .",
    "first , in contrast to the cases described above , in @xmath12 we do not have a good candidate for the critical solution .",
    "the only potential candidate is the self - similar solution @xmath135 with one unstable mode , however , as mentioned in section 2 , this solution is singular outside the past light cone of the blowup point and therefore can not be a _ bona fide _ critical solution .",
    "second , we face the following difficulty when trying to determine @xmath130 . as we approach the expected value of @xmath130 from above the wave initially shrinks but at some later time @xmath157 it bounces back and expands outside with decreasing amplitude .",
    "during this period of evolution the amplitude of outer wave front decreases faster then the amplitude of the solution at the center , so a flat , slowly decreasing with time central region develops . after some time @xmath158 this central part of solution returns and starts growing again to form a singularity at @xmath26 . if we decrease @xmath122 further , the time of bounce @xmath157 almost does not change but the return time @xmath158 increases significantly . therefore , approaching @xmath130 we have to evolve the solution longer and longer on larger and larger grids .",
    "since the numerical grid is always finite , we can not tell if an expanding wave which leaves the grid represents a genuine dispersion or a singular solution with large return time @xmath158 .",
    "figures 10 and 11 illustrate this difficulty",
    ".     0.15 cm     0.15 cm",
    "we have studied formation of singularities for the spherically symmetric semilinear wave equation with the focusing power nonlinearity @xmath159 for three representative values of the exponent @xmath1 : @xmath12 ( subcritical case ) , @xmath19 ( critical case ) , and @xmath44 ( supercritical case ) .",
    "we showed that in all these cases the asymptotic behaviour of blowup can be understood in terms of decaying perturbations about the fundamental ( homogeneous in space ) self - similar solution .",
