    "recent progress in the nano - fabrication of quantum devices enables us to study electron transport through quantum dots(qds ) in a controllable way @xcite since a wide range of energy can be achieved here by continuously changing the applied external potential in contrast with real atoms . a qd- array regarded as",
    "an artificial crystal@xcite also becomes reliable due to the recent development of nanotechnology .",
    "when the size of structures is small with respect to the coherence length , the transmission probability plays an essential role in the quantum transport .",
    "for example , we can obtain the conductance of the devices from the transmission probability with the help of the laudauer - b@xmath3ticker formula .",
    "various methods have been developed for numerical calculations of the transmission probability @xcite .",
    "the quantum transport through a multi - terminal system@xcite can be analyzed in terms of all transmission probabilities between any pair of terminals in principle .",
    "b@xmath3ticker et al.@xcite derived a scattering matrix for a three - terminal junction consisting of homogeneous wires based on the unitary condition and the assumption that the scattering matrix is real .",
    "it was shown that this matrix is energy independent and the coupling parameter has to be determined from phenomenological arguments@xcite .",
    "an energy - dependent scattering matrix for three - terminal junction was found later @xcite .",
    "spintronics has become a new branch of condensed matter physics and material science where not only the charge but also the spin degree of freedom of electrons play an essential role@xcite .",
    "it is of fundamental importance to study the mechanism to generate and control the spin - polarized currents in spintronic devices which may promise practical applications in quantum computing and information@xcite . in recent yeas",
    "the spin - polarized transports in quantum dots have attracted considerable attentions both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , where the spin currents are generated either by magnetic material electrodes or by the rotating - magnetic field which results in the spin - flip .",
    "most of the studies are concentrated on the one or two - qd devices with only one output electrode and the spin - polarized transport in qd - array consisting of arbitrary number of qds with multi - terminal has not yet be investigated . in this paper",
    "we study the quantum transport through a @xmath0-shape qd - array with three electrodes in which the spin - polarized current is induced by static magnetic fields applied on the three arms of the @xmath0-shape qd - array .",
    "we calculate the transmission probability in terms of the scattering matrix which is spin - polarization dependent in the presence of magnetic fields and leads to the spin - polarized currents .",
    "it is the main goal of the present study to show how the spin currents in output terminals can be generated and controlled .",
    "particularly two spin currents of opposite - spin - polarization flowing simultaneously out to electrodes are obtained and seem extremely useful in the design of quantum- logic - gate devices .",
    "the system consisting of three perfect wires ( electrodes ) attached to a @xmath0-shape qd - array of arbitrary number of qds is explained schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the horizontal qd - array is denoted by the lattice sites @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 and the vertical qd - array by the lattice sites @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the numbers of qds on the left , right and vertical arms respectively .",
    "three perfect wires are also described in terms of discrete lattice sites .",
    "the first magnetic field in the z - direction is assumed to be applied , for example , on site @xmath13 , the second magnetic field on the site @xmath14 is along a direction of angle @xmath15 with the z - axis , while the third one on the site @xmath16 has a direction angle @xmath17 .",
    "the latter two magnetic fields not in the same direction as the first one result in the spin - flip of electrons , which is the mechanism generating the spin - polarized transport in the qd - array ( see the hamiltonian below ) .",
    "we remark that it is not necessary to have the three fields to apply on the certain single qd and what we choose the three qds is only for the convenience of analysis",
    ". it may be more easy in practical experiments to superpose the external fields on the three arms of the @xmath0-shape qd - array .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system includes five parts @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the hamiltonians of the horizontal and vertical qd - arrays respectively with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the energy eigenvalues of corresponding qds .",
    "@xmath23and @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 ) are the creation operators of the electrons with spin index @xmath26 on the qds , where @xmath27 denotes the opposite spin polarization with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the zeeman terms induced by the external fields on the sites @xmath14 , and @xmath16 result in the spin - flip .",
    "it should be emphasized that the @xmath15 and @xmath28 dependent terms describing the spin - flip in the hamiltonian are the key mechanism of the spin - polarized transport in our system .",
    "the matrix elements defined by @xmath29 denote the hopping integrals between the nearest neighbors of qds and are independent of spin polarization , except for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , where zeeman energy induced by the external magnetic fields leads to the energy - level splitting and therefore the imbalance of tunnel couplings between spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "the hopping matrix elements in connection with the qds @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath16 are assumed to be @xmath33 .",
    "the hamiltonians of horizontal and vertical electrodes are written as @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the on - site energies in the right - hand - side , the left - hand - side  and the vertical electrodes respectively . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the creation operators of electrons in the electrodes . finally the hopping of electrons between the qd and electrode is described by @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 respectively denote the tunnel couplings between the three special qds , where the magnetic fields are applied , and corresponding electrodes .    the main quantities which we have to calculate in our formulation are the transmission probabilities @xmath45 of electrons from electrode-@xmath46 to electrode-@xmath47 , and the reflection probabilities @xmath48 in the electrode-@xmath46 which is considered as input terminal . for our three - terminal system",
    "we have @xmath49 ( the left electrode ) and @xmath50 ( the right and vertical electrodes ) with @xmath51 denoting the transmission probability from the left to right electrodes and @xmath52 from the left to vertical electrodes .",
    "however the situation is not simple for the evaluation of transmission and reflection probabilities in the multi - terminal system since the electron transport between two electrodes is by no means an isolated process but affected by other electrodes . to this end",

    "more resonant peaks of the spectra appear with the increasing number of qds in the same way as the usual quantum transport in the qd - array without spin - polarization .",
    "the generation of spin currents in the two output electrodes in our model can be understood that a force applied on the spin-@xmath173 which is  induced by the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields , namely @xmath174 (  where * *  * * @xmath175 is the bohr magneton , @xmath176 is the spin g - factor ) , removes the degeneracy of spin - polarization in the transport and thus leads to the relative shifts of resonant peaks of the transmission spectra between the spin - up and spin - down components of electron . * *  * * the spin current appears when the transmission spectrum of one spin component reaches a maximum while the spectrum of the other spin component is a minimum**. * *      the homogeneous dot - arry is just a theoretical idealization and disorder is necessary to be taken into account in practical systems .",

    "we can see that the disorder can shift the resonant peaks of the transmission probability @xmath124 slightly , and suppress the height of some peaks but no more then 20% while increase the height of other peaks no more then 18% . in other words",
