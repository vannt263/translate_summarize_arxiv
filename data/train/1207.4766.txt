    "synthetic biology is an emergent field of biology / biotechnology in which living cells are genetically modified in order to achieve new functions .",
    "biological circuits of interacting genes and proteins have been successfully introduced into living cells to implement various functioning modules such as oscillators @xcite , switches @xcite , logic gates @xcite among others .",
    "inspired by electronic circuit design , synthetic biologists aim to design functioning modules that can be put together in various configurations to build biological devices with designed function . in spite of many successes , circuits with more than a few interacting genes can rarely built reliably and predictably .",
    "for this reason , when it comes to regulation , building effective biosynthetic control circuits remains a big challenge .",
    "recently it has been shown that more complex regulation becomes possible by moving control functions outside the cells and relegating these to a digital computer @xcite .",
    "this ` in - silico ' regulation of living cells also allows the implementation of controllers with more accuracy and higher speeds than what is possible within the environment of the cell . using synthetic biology methods , yeast cells",
    "were genetically engineered so that their gene expression was responsive to light signals . at the same time",
    ", flow cytometry and microscopy methods were used to measure and quantify the resulting protein expression levels in real time .",
    "these measurements were then fed to a computer control system that used a kalman filter / mpc control configuration to generate a control signal consisting of a train of light pulses that drove gene expression . using this setup , feedback control of gene expression in living cells was successfully demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "preliminary results on moment control of reaction networks using pi control laws have been obtained in @xcite where it is shown that such controllers can achieve the desired objectives for certain simple reaction networks .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper is slightly different and directly inspired from the relevant gene expression network considered in @xcite . in the current work , we use a stochastic model of gene expression to explore the feasibility of using simple controllers and continuous ( non - pulsed ) control inputs to achieve effective genetic control of protein mean and variance .",
    "the problems addressed in the paper are beyond those of @xcite since existence and characterization of positive pi controllers , accounting for the presence of nonlinearities , are discussed .",
    "it is shown that local regulation of protein mean levels to any desired value is achievable by acting on the dna transcription rate using proportional - integral feedback .",
    "the pi controller is also shown to be locally robust and exact regions in the controller parameter space that maintain this local robustness are derived . the positivity requirement for control , ignored in @xcite , introduces a static nonlinearity in the feedback system and must be considered to rigorously characterize global stability of the controlled system . using absolute stability theory @xcite and the popov criterion @xcite , it is proved that global asymptotic stability is achievable when the controller gains satisfy very mild sufficient conditions .",
    "next , we show that using a second control input that controls mrna degradation , a multivariable pi feedback controller can be designed so that any desired protein mean and variance setpoints that lie within a certain admissibility region defined by the system can be locally and robustly tracked .",
    "more importantly , it is also shown that there exist common multivariable pi controllers that locally and robustly stabilizes all the equilibrium points in the admissible region .",
    "numerical simulations finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed genetic control systems .",

    "note also that since the lower bound on the achievable variance is independent of the controller structure , it is hence pointless to look for advanced control techniques in view of improving this limit . a positive fact",
