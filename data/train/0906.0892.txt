    "this is work  the second of a pair of articles  on mesoscopic transport through chaotic quantum dots with spatial symmetries ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for part i ) . in both works we use recent advances in semiclassical techniques to address the effect of spatial symmetries on weak localization ( wl ) corrections and universal conductance fluctuations ( ucfs ) .",
    "the aim of the first article was to identify the microscopic origin of properties that were earlier only known from phenomenological random - matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite , and furthermore to extend the considerations to situations in which rmt is not easily applicable .",
    "in particular , this includes scenarios where symmetries are only partially preserved . to this end",
    ", the first article @xcite also considered the combined effects of magnetic fields , a finite ehrenfest time , and dephasing on symmetric systems and also discussed the reduction of symmetry - related interference effects by deformations of the dots .    in the present paper , we contrast this ` internal ' symmetry breaking with symmetry breaking which is due to the position or shape of the leads ( for examples of such situations see fig .  [",
    "fig : asymmleads ] ) .",
    "we ask what happens to the transport if we take a symmetric dot coupled to leads which respect the symmetry , and then start moving one of the leads . in the fully symmetric situation ,",
    "the magnitude of ucfs is doubled for each independent symmetry , while the weak localization correction can be either increased or reduced ( sometimes remain unaffected ) depending on the spatial symmetry in question @xcite .",
    "are these symmetry - induced effects modified when the leads are deformed or displaced ?",
    "if so , are they sensitive to displacement on a quantum scale ( of order of a fermi wavelength ) or a classical scale ( of order of a lead width )",
    "?    the present literature does not offer much guidance to answer these questions  indeed , the knowledge on transport in spatially symmetric systems with displaced leads is rather limited .",
    "reference  @xcite reports that the distribution of transmission eigenvalues of a left - right symmetric dot with completely asymmetrically - placed leads differs slightly from the distribution of a completely asymmetric dot . because the difference is small , symmetric systems ( such as stadium billiards ) with displaced leads are indeed often used as representatives of completely asymmetric systems ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "recent works of one of the authors , on the other hand , identify a huge conductance peak in weakly coupled mirror - symmetric double - dots which still remains large even when the leads are not placed symmetrically @xcite .",
    "a simple consideration of weak localization quickly convinces us that it could never be as robust as the above - mentioned huge conductance peak in double dots . in systems without spatial symmetries ,",
    "weak localization is the counter - part of coherent backscattering ",
    "particle conservation guarantees that one can not have one without the other .",
    "systems with spatial symmetries have addition coherent back- and forward - scattering contributions ( as discussed in the first of this pair of articles @xcite ) .",
    "these contributions rely on interference between paths that are related by spatial symmetry .",
    "if those paths do not both couple to the leads , they can not generate an interference contribution to conductance .",
    "thus , if we displace one lead so much that there is no intersection with its spatially symmetric partner ( @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmleads ] ) then the contributions to coherent forward scattering due to the spatial symmetries must vanish .    the precise distance by which one has to move the lead to substantially suppress the symmetry - related contributions depends on the detailed position dependence of the coherent forward- and backscattering peaks . in principle , these coherent interference patterns could oscillate on a scale of a wavelength , and",
    "thus one might imagine that a small displacement of that order would suffice .",
    "the calculations and numerical computations presented by us here show that this is not the case .",
    "instead , the coherent forward- and backscattering peaks have a width of order the lead width , and do not oscillate on the scale of a wavelength .",
    "these considerations entail that the displacement of leads in internally symmetric systems offers a unique means to study coherent forward- and backscattering processes .",
    "from photonic systems it is known that the shape of the coherent backscattering cone provides valuable information on the multiple scattering in a sample @xcite .",
    "based on the results of the present work , transport measurements with gradually displaced leads promise to give similar insight into the dynamics of electronic systems .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : backgrd ] introduces notation and provides a condensed review of the basic semiclassical concepts elaborated in more detail in the first of this pair of articles @xcite .",
    "the following sections describe the consequences of displaced leads for the weak localization correction in systems with left - right symmetry ( sec.[sect : lr ] ) , inversion symmetry ( sec .  [",
    "sect : inv ] ) , up - down symmetry ( sec .  [ sect : ud ] ) and four - fold symmetry ( sec.[sect:4f ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sect : ucfs ] we study the magnitude of universal conductance fluctuations for all types of symmetry .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect : rmt ] we generalize the phenomenological rmt model of symmetry breaking ( presented in @xcite ) to the case of displaced leads , and compare the results of numerical computations to the semiclassical predictions .",
    "our conclusions are collected in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendix contains some further details on the semiclassical calculation of universal conductance fluctuations .",
    "to make this article self - contained we here first fix notation and then briefly summarize the main concepts of the theory of semiclassical transport in systems with spatial symmetries , developed in the first of this pair of articles @xcite .",
    "we consider chaotic quantum dots of size @xmath1 [ area @xmath2 and circumference @xmath3 which may possess any of the following three types of spatial symmetry ; a left - right mirror - symmetry , an inversion symmetry , and an up - down mirror - symmetry .",
    "we also consider four - fold symmetric systems which simultaneously possess all the above symmetries .",
    "the quantum dot is perfectly coupled to two leads , labelled left ( l ) and right ( r ) and carrying @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes , where @xmath6 for @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 is the fermi momentum ; we also denote the fermi velocity by @xmath9 ) .",
    "the quantum dynamics in the dot is characterized by a number of time scales , given by the time of flight @xmath10 between successive reflections off the boundaries , the dwell time @xmath11 , the dephasing time @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the dephasing rate ) , and a time scale @xmath14 on which a magnetic field destroys time - reversal symmetry . here",
    ", @xmath15 is a characteristic field strength at which about one flux quantum penetrates the quantum dot . in transport , the effect of a magnetic field is felt at a smaller magnetic field @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a system - specific parameter of order one @xcite .",

    "[ fig : asymmleads ] , the displacement from the symmetry - respecting position is characterized by the overlap of leads under the relevant symmetry operation . for left - right mirror symmetry and inversion symmetry , this is the width @xmath22 of the intersection of a lead with the image of the other lead .",
    "an up - down symmetry maps each symmetry - respecting lead onto itself .",
    "the displacement of lead l ( r ) is then characterized by the width @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) of the intersection of this lead with its own mirror image . in a four - fold symmetric system ,",
    "the displacement is characterized by the various widths of intersections with respect to the individual symmetries ( @xmath25 for left - right mirror symmetry , @xmath26 for inversion symmetry , @xmath27 for up - down mirror symmetry of lead l and @xmath28 for up - down mirror symmetry of lead r ) .",

    "the identification of possible pairings is also at the heart of the calculation of the magnitude @xmath51 of universal conductance fluctuations , which in the semiclassical theory naturally takes the form of a quadruple sum over classical paths @xcite .",

    "one crucial check is to verify that the sum of all interference contributions to transmission and reflection gives zero , thereby ensuring particle conservation .    the main difference from the equivalent calculation for a system with symmetric leads ( cf . ref .",
