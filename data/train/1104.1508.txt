    "the geometric structure of a random coordinate projection of a class of functions plays an important role in empirical processes theory , where it is used to determine whether the uniform law of large numbers or the uniform central limit theorem is satisfied by the given class .",
    "indeed , if @xmath2 is a class of functions on a probability space @xmath4 , and if @xmath5 is an independent sample distributed according to @xmath6 , then the `` complexity '' of the random set @xmath7 is the key parameter in addressing both these questions . in this context ,",
    "if @xmath8 are independent , symmetric , @xmath9-valued random variables , then the complexity is governed by the expectation of the supremum of the bernoulli process indexed by @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11 and in particular , on the way this expectation grows as a function of @xmath1 for a typical sample of cardinality @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the structure of such coordinate projections is central to questions in asymptotic geometric analysis as well .",
    "for example , let @xmath12 be a convex , symmetric set ( i.e. , if @xmath13 then @xmath14 ) and put @xmath15 to be the class of linear functionals indexed by @xmath16 . if @xmath17 is a measure on @xmath18 , then @xmath10 is the set @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the random operator @xmath21 .",
    "fundamental questions on the geometry of convex , symmetric sets , such as dvoretzky s theorem and low-@xmath22 estimates have been answered by obtaining accurate , quantitative information on the structure of such coordinate projections , and by using very similar complexity parameters to ( [ eq : intro - bernoulli ] ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for both these reasons ,",
    "a lot of effort has been invested in understanding various notions of complexity for a typical coordinate projection of a class of functions .",
    "a well studied direction is to obtain quantitative estimates on the way in which ( [ eq : intro - bernoulli ] ) is related to two other complexity parameters , the combinatorial dimension and covering numbers .",
    "roughly speaking , the combinatorial dimension of @xmath23 at scale @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath25 , is the largest dimension of a coordinate projection of @xmath26 that contains a `` cube '' of scale @xmath24 ( see definition [ def : comb - dim ] for an exact formulation ) .",
    "if @xmath27 is a metric space then the covering number at scale @xmath24 , which we denote by @xmath28 , is the smallest cardinality of a subset @xmath29 such that for every @xmath30 , there is some @xmath31 for which @xmath32 .    connections between ( [ eq : intro - bernoulli ] ) and the combinatorial dimension or the covering numbers of @xmath10 are rather well understood .",
    "for example , a straightforward chaining argument ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) shows that for every @xmath23 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the euclidean metric on @xmath3 , @xmath35 is the diameter with respect to the same metric and @xmath36 is an absolute constant , independent of the dimension @xmath1 and of the set @xmath26 .",
    "some of the other relations between these parameters are far more involved .",
    "first , controlling the @xmath37 covering numbers using the combinatorial dimension was resolved in @xcite , where it was shown that if @xmath26 is a subset of the unit cube @xmath38 and @xmath17 is any probability measure on @xmath39 , then for every @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath16 and @xmath36 are absolute constants .",
    "also , the solution of the sign embedding of @xmath42 problem ( see @xcite ) implies that if @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath45 . in other words , under a normalization condition ( @xmath43 ) , the only reason that @xmath46 is almost extremal is that @xmath26 contains a high - dimensional cubic structure .    in this article , we study a related geometric parameter  the discrepancy of a typical coordinate projection .",
    "discrepancy was introduced in a combinatorial context ( see the book @xcite for an extensive survey on this topic ) and is defined as follows .",
    "[ def : disc ] if @xmath23 , then the discrepancy of @xmath26 is @xmath47 and the infimum is taken with respect to all signs @xmath48 .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the hereditary discrepancy of @xmath26 , given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coordinate projection of @xmath26 onto @xmath52 .",
    "observe that if @xmath53 is the convex hull of @xmath54 , then @xmath55 .",
    "hence , from the geometric viewpoint , the discrepancy of @xmath26 is proportional with a constant @xmath56 to the minimal width of @xmath53 in a direction of a vertex of the combinatorial cube @xmath57 .",
    "the hereditary discrepancy is governed by a similar minimal width , but of the `` worst '' coordinate projection of @xmath53 .",
    "our goal here is to study the discrepancy using the covering numbers and the combinatorial dimension of @xmath26 , but we will focus on sets @xmath26 that are random coordinate projections of a class of function @xmath2 , which gives them more structure .",
    "a  natural question in this context is to identify conditions on @xmath2 under which there is a gap between @xmath58 and @xmath59 for a typical coordinate projection of @xmath2 , as a function of the sample size @xmath1 . to that end",
    ", we will develop dimension dependent bounds on the discrepancy of @xmath60 ( and in particular , bounds that are not asymptotic ) .",
    "note that the metric structure of @xmath23 is not enough to determine its discrepancy . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath62 then @xmath63 . on the other hand , if @xmath64 , which is linearly isometric to @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for the large gap in the discrepancy between the two isometric sets is that @xmath67 consists of a vector that is `` well spread '' while @xmath65 consists of a `` peaky '' vector with respect to the underlying coordinate structure . in that sense",
    ", @xmath67 is in a much better position than @xmath65 .",
    "note that in this example , @xmath68and for the set @xmath67 , which is in a `` good position '' there is gap between the expectation for signs and the discrepancy .",
    "we will show that this is a general phenomenon : it is well known that @xmath69 is determined by the euclidean metric structure of @xmath26 ( up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension ) , and therefore , it is almost invariant under a linear isometry ( i.e. , a change in the coordinate structure ) .",
    "thus , the expectation almost does not change when applying an isometry or a good isomorphism of @xmath34 .",
    "as we will explain here , the situation with the discrepancy is rather different and the position of the set matters a great deal . since the sets @xmath26 that we will be interested in are not arbitrary but have some structure  as random coordinate projections of well behaved function classes",
    ", they will be much closer in nature to @xmath67 than to @xmath65 .",
    "our main result is that if the canonical gaussian process indexed by @xmath70 is continuous and if the class satisfies a subgaussian condition [ i.e. , if the @xmath71 norm is equivalent to the @xmath72 norm on @xmath2 , see definition [ def : sub - gauss - set ] ] , then a typical coordinate projection of @xmath2 behaves as a set of vectors in a `` general position . '' as such , and just like the set @xmath67 , a typical coordinate projection exhibits certain shrinking properties that will be explained in section [ sec : shrink ] , and which causes the discrepancy of such a set to be much smaller than the average over signs .",
    "[ theoa ] let @xmath70 be a class of mean zero functions .",
    "assume further that the canonical gaussian process indexed by @xmath2 is continuous and that the @xmath72 and @xmath71 norms are equivalent on @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath73 in probability .    to put theorem [ theoa ] in the right perspective , observe that if the @xmath74 and @xmath37 norms are equivalent on a class of mean zero functions @xmath2 , then for every integer @xmath1 there is a subset of @xmath75 of probability at least @xmath36 on which @xmath76 where @xmath36 depends only on the equivalence constant between the @xmath77 and @xmath37 norms on @xmath2 , @xmath78 is an absolute constant and @xmath79",
    ". hence , there is a true gap between the discrepancy and the mean of a typical coordinate projection .",
    "although the formulation of theorem [ theoa ] is asymptotic , the result itself is quantitative in nature , as a function of the dimension of the coordinate projection .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theoa ] is , in fact , a dimension dependent estimate on the sequences @xmath80 , for which , with probability at least @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "we will show that the sequences @xmath80 are given using metric parameters that measure the continuity of the gaussian process indexed by @xmath2talagrand s @xmath83 functionals @xcite .",
    "the @xmath83 functionals will be defined in section  [ sec : pre ] , but for now let us mention that under mild measurability assumptions on the class , the canonical gaussian process indexed by @xmath2 is continuous if and only if @xmath84 .",
    "we will prove that for every @xmath85 and @xmath86 there are constants @xmath36 and @xmath87 that depend on @xmath88 , @xmath89 and on the equivalence constant between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 norms on @xmath2 , such that for every @xmath1 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the diameter of @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath72 norm . and , in particular , under the assumptions of theorem [ theoa ] , for every @xmath86 , @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , the proof of theorem [ theoa ] actually shows that for every  @xmath1 , with @xmath6-probability of at least @xmath81 , @xmath93 where @xmath87 and @xmath36 depend on @xmath88 , @xmath89 and the equivalence constant between the @xmath72 and @xmath71 norms on @xmath2 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theoa ] is based on two ingredients .",
    "the first is a new estimate on the discrepancy of an arbitrary set @xmath94 .",
    "it is a combination of the entropy method , which is often used to control the combinatorial discrepancy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and talagrand s generic chaining mechanism @xcite , which was introduced to establish the connection between the @xmath83 functionals and the continuity of gaussian processes .",
    "the combination of these two methods will be explained in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "it allows one to find a good choice of signs for roughly @xmath95 coordinates , while the error incurred by considering the sum taken only on these coordinates is determined by the @xmath83 functional for @xmath96 . repeating this argument , one obtains a bound on the discrepancy of @xmath26 in terms of a sum of @xmath83 functionals of coordinate projections of @xmath26 and for values @xmath97 that depend on the dimension of each projection , and those dimensions decrease quickly .",
    "the second component required for the proof of theorem [ theoa ] is that the sets we are interested in are not general .",
    "we will obtain a structural result on a typical @xmath10 that allows us to bound the @xmath83 functionals of its coordinate projections using the @xmath72 structure of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , we will show that if the @xmath72 and @xmath71 norms are equivalent on @xmath2 then a typical coordinate projection @xmath10 has a rather regular structure  it is a subset of a minkowski sum of two sets .",
    "the first one is small , with a bounded diameter in the weak @xmath98 space @xmath99 .",
    "the other set is a subset of @xmath10 itself and can be viewed as a set of vectors in a `` general position . '' in particular , further coordinate projections of the latter set shrink distances between any two of its elements .",
    "the structural result we obtain is of independent interest and can be used to derive information on the geometry of convex sets .",
    "for example , consider a symmetric probability measure @xmath17 on @xmath100 .",
    "we say that @xmath17 isotropic and @xmath101-subgaussian if a random vector @xmath102 distributed according to @xmath17 satisfies that for every @xmath103 , @xmath104 simple examples of isotropic , @xmath101-subgaussian measures on @xmath100 are the gaussian measure and the uniform measure on the vertices of the cube @xmath105 , where in both cases @xmath101 can be taken to be an absolute constant , independent of the dimension .",
    "let @xmath106 be independent random vectors , distributed according to @xmath17 and consider the random operator @xmath107 defined by @xmath108 .",
    "[ corolb ] for any @xmath109 there are constants @xmath110 and @xmath111 that depend only on @xmath101 , for which the following holds .",
    "let @xmath112 and set @xmath113 . then",
    ", for every @xmath114 , with probability at least @xmath115 , for every @xmath116 , @xmath117 where @xmath118 are independent , standard gaussian random variables , and both expectations are taken with respect to those variables .",
    "corollary [ corolb ] shows that the random operator @xmath20 maps an arbitrary @xmath26 to a set of vectors in a `` general position '' in a strong sense , since it implies that for most vectors in @xmath119 , mutual distances are shrunk by any further coordinate projection .",
    "let us note that we will prove a stronger result than corollary [ corolb ] , namely that the @xmath83 functionals associated with @xmath119 display this type of shrinking phenomenon .",
    "the final result we present has to do with the reverse direction of theorem  [ theoa ] .",
    "assume that @xmath120 is a convex , symmetric set , which satisfies that the canonical gaussian process @xmath121 is bounded and that the @xmath72 and @xmath71 norms are equivalent on @xmath122 .",
    "we will show that if the logarithm of the @xmath72 covering numbers of @xmath122 grows like @xmath123 then for a typical sample @xmath5 selected according to @xmath6 , @xmath124 it is standard to verify ( see lemma [ lemma : disc - vs - vc ] ) that if @xmath23 , then @xmath125    therefore , if @xmath2 is a class of mean - zero functions and @xmath126 satisfies the above , then @xmath127 , complementing the upper bound established in theorem [ theoa ] .    although this is not exactly the reverse direction of theorem [ theoa ] , it is very close to it .",
    "indeed , if @xmath70 indexes a bounded gaussian process then so does @xmath126 , and the logarithm of the covering numbers of @xmath122 can not grow faster than @xmath128 . on the other hand , if the log - covering numbers grow a little slower , even by a suitable logarithmic factor , then @xmath129 .",
    "in fact , this is as close as one can get to a covering numbers characterization of the fact that @xmath130 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this result not only shows that @xmath131 is large if the gaussian process @xmath2 indexes is bounded but not continuous , it also shows why . under a boundedness assumption on the gaussian process [ which implies that @xmath132 is bounded ] , the reason the hereditary discrepancy of @xmath10 is extremal is because a typical coordinate projection of @xmath133 contains a high dimensional , large cubic structure , and that forces the hereditary discrepancy to be large .",
    "the proof of this result , which is presented in section [ sec : upp - low ] , is based on the observation that if @xmath2 is convex and symmetric then the richness of @xmath2 at scale @xmath134 is exhibited by the existence of cubes of scale @xmath134 and of dimension @xmath135 in a typical coordinate projection of @xmath2 of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "it thus should be viewed as a `` small scale '' version of the sign embedding theorem which was mentioned above .",
    "unfortunately , the optimal estimate in the sign embedding theorem can not be used directly in our case , firstly because @xmath10 is unlikely to be a subset of @xmath38 , and secondly , because a typical coordinate projection of @xmath2 satisfies that @xmath136 hence , the optimal estimate in the sign embedding theorem has to be used for @xmath137 , and that only ensures that @xmath10 contains a cube of scale @xmath134 and of constant dimension , which is far from what we need .",
    "the proof of the existence of a cube in @xmath10 is based on two localization arguments , one with respect to the @xmath37 norm and the other with respect to the @xmath138 norm .",
    "the first localization shows that if the @xmath72 covering number of @xmath2 at scale @xmath134 is of the order of @xmath139 then the richness of a typical coordinate projection of @xmath2 of dimension @xmath135 originates from the set @xmath140 that is , functions in @xmath2 of @xmath72 norm at most @xmath141 . in the second localization ,",
    "one shows that the complexity of a typical coordinate projection actually comes from a further pointwise truncation of the functions in @xmath2 , and @xmath142 in ( [ eq : intersect ] ) can essentially be replaced by @xmath143the unit ball in @xmath144 .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : pre ] , we present further preliminaries , most of them concerning subgaussian variables and the @xmath83 functionals . in section [ sec : disc ] , we develop bounds on the discrepancy of an arbitrary subset of @xmath100 .",
