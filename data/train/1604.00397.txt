    "contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of nearby pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) stars provide opportunities to investigate variable astrophysical phenomena related to interactions between such stars and their planet - forming circumstellar disks , as well as to measure the gas and dust content of these disks . pre - ms stars @xmath162 m@xmath17 ( i.e. , t tauri stars ) are broadly subdivided into classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) and weak - lined t tauri stars ( wttss ) based on the strength of their h@xmath18 emission , which serves as a proxy for their stage of evolution as star - disk systems . during the ctts ( strong h@xmath18 emission ) stage",

    "therefore , pre - ms stars with circumstellar disks @xmath19 8 myr provide a unique opportunity to investigate late - stage disk evolution .",

    "the variability timescale will depend on the mechanism producing such variability and can range anywhere from hours to years .",
    "moreover , some of these variability mechanisms are dependent on the orientation of the star - disk system with respect to our line of sight .",
    "previous studies of nearly edge - on or highly inclined circumstellar disks confirm the presence of variability associated with the temporary and/or periodic obscuration of the stellar photosphere from disk warps / and or clumps ( e.g. , aa tau , ry lupi , t cha ; * ? ? ?",

    "such photospheric obscuration would only be expected to be observed in highly inclined disks , because the bulk of circumstellar material is confined to the disk plane .",
    "contemporaneous multiwavelength observations can elucidate this mechanism of variability in star - disk systems .",
    "more generally , multiwavelength studies of nearby ( @xmath6100 pc ) , pre - ms m stars provide the opportunity to investigate the early evolution of the most plentiful type of star in the galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref . therein ) .",
    "high - energy radiation ( e.g. , nuv , fuv , x - ray ) from nearby m - type stars decreases with increasing age , as @xcite demonstrated by comparing the high - energy luminosities of early m - type pre - ms stars in the tw hydrae association ( twa ; age@xmath18 myr ) with those of a nearby ( @xmath2010 pc ) main - sequence m dwarf sample .",
    "however , the timescale for this decline is not well determined , especially for mid- to late - m stars .",
    "moreover , constraints on high - energy emission and variability are particularly important for theories of planet formation around m - type stars , given that their habitable zones lie at relatively small orbital radii and that such radiation can have important effects on the evaporation and chemistry of protoplanetary disks and planetary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the two components of the recently discovered wide separation binary ( @xmath13400 au ) twa 30 @xcite , represent two of the nearest examples of actively accreting , m type pre - ms star - disk systems ( d@xmath142 pc ) .",

    "furthermore , the proximity of the twa allows for easier characterization of very low - mass stars like twa 30a ( m5 ) and 30b ( m4 ) since stars of such late spectral types would be too faint for detailed study at the @xmath21 100 pc distances typical of well - studied star - forming clouds .",
    "both twa 30a and 30b have mid - ir excesses indicative of dusty circumstellar disks @xcite and both display signatures of outflows and jet emission in the form of strong forbidden emission lines ( e.g. , [ o i ] , [ o ii ] , [ n ii ] , and [ si ii ] ) .",
    "these lines display small velocity shifts with respect to rest velocity , suggesting that the outflows lie nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "if the outflows are perpendicular to the circumstellar disk , then this orientation suggests the viewing geometry of these relatively rare late - stage , ( i.e. @xmath22 myr ) disks around twa 30a and 30b are nearly edge - on @xcite .",
    "the nearby twa 30a and 30b systems hence offer the potential to study both gas and dust absorption and emission , respectively , by measuring the attenuation of coronally and/or accretion generated x - rays by circumstellar gas and the attenuation and reprocessing of photospheric near - ir and optical emission by circumstellar dust , with little or no contamination from interstellar material .",
    "both twa 30a and 30b display significant near - ir variability @xcite , although the mechanisms causing the variability in these stars appear to be different .",
    "the near - ir variability of twa 30a tends to follow the reddening vector , with typical values in the range of a@xmath23 @xmath1 1 - 9 .",
    "this suggests that a changing column density of circumstellar disk dust is responsible for variable reddening of the stellar photosphere .",
    "in contrast , the near - ir variability of 30b tends to follow the ctts locus , possibly indicative of reprocessed starlight emitted by an inner - disk structure and variably scattered towards us .",
    "twa 30a was reported in @xcite to have been detected in x - rays in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) faint source catalog at a distance of 17.6 arcseconds from the 2mass position , well within the @xmath125 arcsecond spatial resolution of rosat at @xmath11 kev .",
    "twa 30b was not detected in rass .",
    "x - rays in pre - ms stars can be coronally generated and/or the result of star - disk interactions ( e.g. , star - disk magnetic reconnection events and magnetically funneled accretion ) and have been shown to be variable on timescales of hours to years @xcite .",
    "therefore x - ray observations of such stars and their x - ray variability offer a means to probe pre - ms stellar magnetic and accretion activity . furthermore , ( @xmath20 1 kev ) x - ray emission is absorbed by circumstellar gas ( mainly atomic c , n , and o ; * ? ? ? * ) and can thus be used to estimate a line of sight gas column density due to the disk .",

    "x - ray observations of twa 30a and 30b ( table [ twa30_obs ] ) were obtained with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instrument on board the xmm - newton observatory ( obs.ids 0672500201 and 0672500301 ) .",

    "@xcite had previously shown , based on near - ir spectroscopy collected over the period 2008 - 2009 , that twa 30a and 30b are highly near - ir variable on timescales of days and that their variations follow the reddening vector and the ctts ( dust emission excess ) locus , respectively . for twa 30a ,",
    "this variable emission was suggested to be due to variable obscuration of the stellar photosphere by circumstellar dust .",
    "this explanation can account for the variable reddening detected .",
    "however , in the observations presented in this work , reddening of the photosphere alone can not account for twa 30a s variability . instead",
    ", our measurements of [ j - h ] and [ h - k ] colors ( figure [ 2mass_cc ] ) evidently display a combination of both reddening and @xmath10.8 - 1.6 @xmath30 m near - infrared excess .",
    "furthermore , the slope of the continuum between @xmath10.8 - 1.6 @xmath30@xmath31 is flatter in the 2011 june and july observations compared with those of the @xcite observations , possibly indicative of an additional dust scattering component or a continuum excess ( figure [ twa30a_red ] ) . in the case of classical t tauri stars ,",
    "near - ir continuum excess is generally indicative of accretion @xcite . in the case of twa 30a , however , accretion is unlikely to contribute excess flux in the 1.6 - 2.0 @xmath30 m region where our reddened spectral template fits assume an excess - free region ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "we caution that strong accretion signatures , including veiling affecting the li i and k i lines , have been previously observed in twa 30a @xcite and in some cases , cttss have demonstrated nir continuum excess in the entire @xmath10.48 - 2.1 @xmath30 m range @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of a slight 2.2 - 2.4 @xmath30 m excess in the 2011 june observation indicates that excess near - ir continuum emission alone can not account for the shape of this spectrum .",
    "both the 2011 june and july near - ir spectral observations of twa 30b closely match the colors and spectral shape of the previous @xcite observations obtained at the lowest levels of near - ir excess ( figures [ twa30b_compare ] and [ 2mass_cc ] ) .    in the case of twa 30a , a potential decrease of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in @xmath2 over two decades",
    "is evident when comparing the results of the 1990 rosat and 2011 xmm observations ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism by which a pre - ms star can decrease in x - ray luminosity by such significant levels within a timespan of @xmath120 years is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that twa 30a was undergoing a flaring event in 1990 . while individual flaring events for pre - ms stars may happen on timescales of hours to days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , longer - term ( year - timescale ) x - ray variability in count rate has been observed for pre - ms stars in l1630 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that twa 30a may have undergone an accretion outburst similar to those seen in fu ori and ex lupi type objects ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "such outbursts can be accompanied by order of magnitude changes in brightness in the near - ir , optical and x - ray , as in the case of v1647 ori @xcite . however , this scenario can not be confirmed in the case of twa 30a as there are no optical / ir observations available contemporaneous with the 1990 rosat observation .",
    "while the mechanism by which twa 30a has decreased in @xmath2 remains unclear , the impact of such a change in @xmath2 may be significant when considering processes such as disk ionization @xcite and mass - loss via x - ray induced photodissociation @xcite over the lifetime of the disk .    in the context of other pre - ms stars of similar mass ( @xmath10.1 @xmath32 ) , the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of twa 30a as measured by rosat in 1990 appears typical when compared to , e.g. , low mass stars in the onc @xcite and ic 348 @xcite .",
    "however , it then follows that the significant decrease in @xmath2 from 1990 to 2011 places twa 30a well below typical x - ray luminosities for low - mass , pre - ms m type stars .",
    "an important difference to consider when comparing twa 30a with stars of similar spectral type in the onc and ic 348 is stellar age and evolution . while twa 30a",
    "may still host a circumstellar disk with signatures of youth , its age ( @xmath1 8 myr ) is markedly older than its counterparts in the onc and ic 348 ( mean age of 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 myr , respectively * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , with a spectral type of m5/m6 ( see section 3 ) and age of @xmath18 myr , twa 30a lies very close to the substellar boundary as indicated by its hr diagram position given pre - ms stellar evolution models of @xcite and @xcite ( e.g. , see figures 5 and 1 in @xcite and @xcite for hr diagrams and evolutionary models of pre - ms stars in taurus and pre - ms brown dwarfs in the onc , respectively ) .",
    "such models indicate an m5/m6 at @xmath18 myr may have evolved from and will evolve to a later spectral type ( @xmath1m7 , i.e. , the substellar boundary ) . indeed , while the x - ray luminosity of twa 30a is lower than its @xmath1m5 counterparts in ic 348 @xcite , it is consistent with those of the @xmath1 1 myr onc @xmath1m7 brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "fractional x - ray luminosity is a commonly used proxy for magnetic activity in young stars [ e.g.,][]@xcite .",
    "twa 30a s fractional x - ray luminosity in the 2011 july epoch ( @xmath2/@xmath33 @xmath34 ) was lower than many of the reported @xmath1 m5-m7 pre - ms stars in the onc , taurus , and ic 348 @xcite while its intrinsic @xmath2 is significantly fainter than its similar - massed counterparts .",
    "if these values are representative of twa 30a s quiescent state , the low @xmath2/@xmath33 and @xmath2 values suggest that twa 30a may be a representative of the progenitors of the late - type m and early l type _ main - sequence _ dwarf stars which display a lack of x - rays @xcite . in the case of main sequence stars",
    ", such phenomena may be the result of changes in magnetic field configuration or the decreasing ionization fractions in the stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "a smaller ionization fraction in the stellar atmosphere will decrease the coupling of that material to the stellar magnetic fields and , thus , will decrease the coronal x - ray luminosity . with a spectral type of m5/m6 , twa 30a ( t@xmath35 @xmath13050 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lies at the border of the regime ( t@xmath35 of 1500 - 3000 ) investigated in @xcite for main sequence mid m to late l stars , where magnetic interaction ( between the chromosphere and stellar magnetic field ) was limited .",
    "it also follows that twa 30b , with an upper limit of @xmath36 erg s@xmath9 appears unusually x - ray faint compared to similar stars in the onc , taurus and ic 348 .",
    "specifically , given a spectral type of @xmath1m4 and an age of @xmath1 8 myr , we estimate the fractional x - ray luminosity of twa 30b of @xmath2/@xmath33 @xmath37 @xcite , a value well below that of its similar mass counterparts in other nearby star - forming regions .",
    "additional x - ray observations of pre - ms mid - m stars ( e.g. , pre - ms stars that will evolve into main sequence m7 and early l dwarfs ) are needed to better understand whether such a decrease in magnetic activity as probed by @xmath38 is characteristic of these young low - mass stars near the h burning limit .",
    "twa 30a and 30b appear to be at the cusp of this x - ray active / inactive boundary .",
    "this suggests that , in this binary , we could be seeing the of x - ray activity in pre - ms low mass stars that is observed in main sequence stars of @xmath1m7 or later .",
    "while optical evidence suggests twa 30a is actively accreting @xcite , we find no evidence of shock - heated plasma at temperatures characteristic of free - fall accretion onto a mid m - type pre - ms star ( t@xmath12 mk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "this suggests the hydrogen absorbing column density ( @xmath14 ) is too large and/or the emission measure of shocked material is too small to detect such an x - ray accretion signature .",
    "to probe shocks at the base of a jet , i.e. , shocks farther from the star and thus more difficult to hide behind an absorbing disk , higher resolution x - ray observations are needed .",
    "a comparison of measurements of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for twa 30a at our two observing epochs ( see tables 2 and 3 ) is shown in figure [ twa30_nh_av ] .",
    "these results are overlaid with @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 curves determined for the ism @xcite and @xmath27 ophiuchi molecular cloud gas @xcite .",
    "regardless of the choice of @xmath29 assumed in our calculation of @xmath15 , a correlation between optical and x - ray extinction is evident for twa 30a : both @xmath15 and @xmath14 are found to decrease between 2011 june to 2011 july .",
    "such variability is consistent with variable obscuration of the photosphere by a disk warp and/or clump .",
    "other pre - ms star - disk systems notable for their high disk inclinations show similar levels of optical variability ( e.g. , aa tau ; ry lupi ; t cha ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , even considering different values of @xmath29 , at both epochs twa 30a lies below the line typical of that of the ism , indicating a deficiency of the metals ( c , n , and/or o ) that are most responsible for soft x - ray absorption .",
    "this suggests that either these metals are not abundant in the gas component of the twa 30a disk , or that these metals are frozen out as molecular ( e.g. , co , co@xmath54 , ch@xmath55 ) ices onto dust grains , reducing their x - ray absorption cross - sections .",

    "<S> we present contemporaneous xmm - newton x - ray and ground - based optical / near - ir spectroscopic observations of the nearby ( @xmath0 pc ) , low - mass ( mid - m ) binary system twa 30a and 30b . </S>",
    "<S> the components of this wide ( separation @xmath13400 au ) binary are notable for their nearly edge - on disk viewing geometries , high levels of variability , and evidence for collimated stellar outflows . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained xmm - newton x - ray observations of twa 30a and 30b in 2011 june and july , accompanied ( respectively ) by irtf spex ( near - ir ) and vlt xshooter ( visible / near - ir ) spectroscopy obtained within @xmath120 hours of the x - ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> twa 30a was detected in both xmm - newton observations at relatively faint intrinsic x - ray luminosities ( @xmath2@xmath1@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ) compared to stars of similar mass and age . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic ( 0.15 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray luminosities measured in 2011 had decreased by a factor 20 - 100 relative to a 1990 ( rosat ) x - ray detection . </S>",
    "<S> twa 30b was not detected , and we infer an upper limit of ( @xmath2 @xmath6 3.0 @xmath7 @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we measured a large change in visual extinction toward twa 30a ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) between the two 2011 observing epochs , and we find evidence for a corresponding significant decrease in x - ray absorbing column ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent correlated change in @xmath13 and @xmath12 is suggestive of variable obscuration of the stellar photosphere by disk material composed of both gas and dust . </S>",
    "<S> however , in both observations , the inferred @xmath14 to @xmath15 ratio is lower than that typical of the ism , suggesting that the disk is either depleted of gas or is deficient in metals in the gas phase .    </S>",
