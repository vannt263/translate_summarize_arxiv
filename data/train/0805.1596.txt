    "in physics , the notion of quantum resonance has appeared at the begining of quantum mechanics .",
    "its introduction was motivated by the behavior of various quantities related to scattering experiments , such as the scattering cross - section . at certain energies , these quantities present peaks ( nowaday called breit - wigner peaks ) , which were modelized by a lorentzian shaped function @xmath2 the real numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the location of the maximum of the peak and its height .",
    "of course for @xmath5 , one has @xmath6 and the complex number @xmath7 was called a resonance .",
    "such complex values for energies had also appeared for example in the work @xcite by gamow , to explain @xmath8-radioactivity , and were associated to the existence of some decaying state of energy @xmath9 and lifetime @xmath10 .    however , these complex numbers are not defined in a completely exact way , in the sense that the peaks do not perceivably change if these numbers are modified by a quantity much smaller than their imaginary part .",
    "indeed , a straightforward computation shows that the relative difference between such two peaks @xmath11 and @xmath12 verifies , @xmath13 where we have also set @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "the two peaks become undistinguishable if @xmath15 , that is , there is no physical relevance to associate the resonance @xmath16 to @xmath11 rather than any other @xmath17 verifying @xmath18 .",
    "notice also that the more the resonance is far from the real line , the more irrelevant this precision becomes .    on the mathematical side ,",
    "the more recent theory of resonances for schrdinger operators has permitted to give a rigorous framework and to obtain very precise results , in particular on the location of resonances in relation with the geometry of the underlying classical flow . however , it is based on the notion of complex scaling , in more and more sophisticated versions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that all require analyticity assumptions on the potential ( or its fourier transform ) .",
    "there is a small number of works about the definition of resonances for non - analytic potentials , as e.g. @xcite . in @xcite , the point of view",
    "is quite different from ours , while in @xcite , the definition is based on the use of an almost - analytic extension of the potential and seems to strongly depend both on the choice of this extension and on the complex distortion .    here",
    "our purpose is to give a definition that fulfills both the mathematical requirement of being invariant with respect to the choices one has to make , and the physical requirement of being more accurate as the resonance become closer to the real ( or , equivalently , as the breit - wigner peak becomes narrower ) . dropping the physically irrelevant precision for the definition of resonances",
    ", we can also drop the spurious assumption on the analyticity of the potential .    more precisely , we associate to a schrdinger operator @xmath19 a discrete set @xmath20 with certain properties , such that , for any other set @xmath21 with the same properties , there exists a bijection @xmath22 with @xmath23 uniformly .",
    "the set of resonances of @xmath19 is the corresponding equivalence class of @xmath24 .",
    "of course , when the potential is dilation analytic at infinity , we recover the usual set of resonances up to the same error @xmath25 .",
    "the properties characterizing @xmath24 basically involve the resonances of a ( essentially arbitrary ) family of dilation - analytic operators @xmath26 , such that , @xmath27 and the constructive proof of the existence of the set @xmath24 mainly consists in studying such a family and , in particular , in obtaining resolvent estimates uniform in @xmath28 .    in this paper , we address the case of an isolated cluster of resonances with a bounded ( with respect to @xmath29 ) cardinality .",
    "we hope to treat the general case elsewhere , as well as to give a detailed description of the quantum evolution @xmath30 in terms of the resonances in @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give our assumptions and state our main results in section [ sec - result ] .",
    "then , in section 3 , we give two paradigmatic situations where our constructions apply : the non - traping case and the shape resonances case . in section 4",
    "we present a suitable notion of analytic approximation of a @xmath1 function through which we define the operator @xmath31 . in section [ sec - dist ]",
    "we show that a properly defined analytic distorted operator @xmath32 of the latter verifies a nice resolvent estimate in the upper half complex plane even very near to the real axis .",
    "the sections [ sec - th21],[sec - red ] and [ proofth3 ] are devoted to the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th3 ] respectively .",
    "we construct the set of resonances @xmath24 , and prove theorem [ th4 ] in section [ cons ] . in the last section [ sec - exemp ] ,",
    "we prove our statements concerning the shape resonances .",
    "eventually , we have placed in appendix [ sec - app ] the proofs of two technical lemmas .",
    "we consider the semiclassical schrdinger operator ,    @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a real smooth function of @xmath35 , such that , [ decv ] ^v(x ) = ( x^--|| ) , for some @xmath36 and for all @xmath37 .",
    "we also fix @xmath38 once for all , and , for any @xmath39 small enough , we denote by @xmath40 a @xmath41-analytic @xmath42-approximation of @xmath43 in the sense of section [ sec - prelim ] . in particular , @xmath44 is analytic with respect to @xmath45 in @xmath46 , it can be extended into a holomorphic function of @xmath47 in the sector @xmath48 , and it verifies , [ compvvhol1 ] v^(x ) - v(x ) = ( ^x^- ) , uniformly on @xmath0 .",

    "in particular , using the same notations as in @xcite , by agmon - type inequalities we see that the distribution kernel @xmath679 of @xmath680 verifies , @xmath681 where @xmath682 stands for the agmon distance between @xmath276 and @xmath683 ( see ( * ? ? ? * lemma 9.4 ) ) . then , assuming @xmath684 for some @xmath164 constant small enough , and performing a suitable grushin problem as in @xcite , we deduce that the resonances of @xmath31 in @xmath170-i[0 , \\lambda_0\\min ( \\mu , h^{2+\\delta})]$ ] ( @xmath73 constant arbitrary ) are close to the eigenvalues of the dirichlet realization of @xmath19 on @xmath685 , up to @xmath686 . since these eigenvalues are real and admit semiclassical asymptotic expansions of the form , @xmath687 ( where the @xmath688 s are as in theorem [ th5 ] ) , we obtain for the corresponding resonances @xmath689 of @xmath31 , [ estresf ] _ k~_0 + e_kh + _ 1_k , h^1+;_k = ( e^-2(s_0-)/h ) , uniformly .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath28 and @xmath690 as in theorem [ th5 ] , the result easily follows .",
    "moreover , since the previous discussion can be applied to any @xmath691 $ ] , application of theorem [ th4 ] tells us that the resonances of @xmath19 in @xmath170-i[0 , \\frac12 h^{2n+\\max(\\frac{n}2,1 ) + 1 + 3\\delta}]$ ] satisfy to the same estimates ( [ estresf ] ) .",
    "for @xmath720 , we have , [ gr+ ] g(r ) = g(2 ) + 2(r -2 ) = 2r - _ , where @xmath721 , and , since , @xmath722 we see that , @xmath723 therefore , for @xmath724 large enough , the unique point @xmath725 , solution of @xmath726 , is given by , [ rlambda ] r_= , where @xmath727 .",
    "let @xmath742 .",
    "we compute , @xmath743 that is , denoting by @xmath744 the orthogonal projection onto @xmath745 , and recalling the notation @xmath746 , @xmath747 in particular , using lemma [ flambda ] , we obtain , @xmath748 in the sense of self - adjoint matrices . on the other hand , we have , @xmath749 with @xmath750 and @xmath751 .",
    "hence , @xmath752 , and , since @xmath753 , @xmath754 and @xmath755 commute , an easy computation gives , @xmath756 ^ 2 & = & -t_\\theta(s_\\theta^2+t_\\theta^2)^{-1}\\xi\\cdot\\xi = - 2\\theta f ( 1+\\theta^2f^2)^{-2}\\xi\\cdot\\xi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , for @xmath58 small enough , we find , @xmath740 ^ 2\\leq -\\theta f(x)\\xi\\cdot\\xi\\leq -\\theta a(|x|)|\\xi|^2.\\ ] ]                                  anders melin and johannes sjstrand , _ fourier integral operators with complex - valued phase functions _ ,",
