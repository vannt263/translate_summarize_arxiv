    "given a homeomorphisms @xmath1 of a compact metric space @xmath2 define the set @xmath3 , for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this set is usually called as the _ dynamical ball_.",
    "we say that @xmath6 is _ expansive _ if for some @xmath4 it holds that @xmath7 for all @xmath5 .",
    "some variations of this definition consider special properties on the set @xmath8 .",
    "for example : @xcite requires that @xmath8 has vanishing topological dimension , @xcite is related with the cardinality of @xmath8 , @xcite considers that @xmath8 has vanishing measure and @xcite asks this set to have vanishing topological entropy .",
    "let us explain another way of thinking about the definition of expansive homeomorphism that i learned from j. lewowicz .",
    "consider that a @xmath9-observer is someone or something whose observations and measures have a precision of @xmath9 . in this way , if two points have a distance smaller than @xmath9 , such an observer will not be able to guess that these two points are different .",
    "then , expansiveness , in terms of our @xmath9-observer , means that at some time he will _ see _ two points , given that he knowns all of the iterates of this two different points .",
    "the idea of the @xmath9-observations was used in @xcite , where it is asked to our @xmath9-observer to guess the cardinality of a finite set knowing its iterates .",
    "this led us in @xcite to the definition of @xmath10-expansive homeomorphism that extends the concept of @xmath11-expansivity introduced by morales @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider both ways of understanding the definition : in terms of the dynamical ball and with our @xmath9-observer .",
    "both concepts are stated from the viewpoint of topological dimension .",
    "we consider that there is a natural number @xmath12 such that for all @xmath5 we have that the topological dimension of @xmath8 is less than @xmath12 .",
    "this kind of homeomorphisms will be called partially expansive with central dimension @xmath12 .",
    "we will also ask to our @xmath9-observer to guess the topological dimension of a set .",
    "the formalization of this idea will be called dimension - wise expansivity .",
    "this article also deals with standard versions of expansivity as the original one introduced by utz and cw - expansivity defined by kato , that in turn , are special instances of partial expansivity .",
    "it is known that there are surface homeomorphisms that are cw - expansive but not expansive .",
    "we will show that this kind of homeomorphisms always presents what we call doubly asymptotic sectors .",
    "expansive homeomorphisms are known to be conjugate with pseudo - anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "as we will see , the world of cw - expansive surface homeomorphisms with doubly asymptotic sectors has some anomalous examples .",
    "we will construct a cw - expansive surface homeomorphism with points whose local stable set is not a finite union of embedded arcs .    for expansive homeomorphisms of three - manifolds ,",
    "vieitez @xcite obtained a conjugation with a linear anosov diffeomorphism assuming some regularity and that there are no wandering points . in @xcite the following question is presented : without assuming that @xmath13 , can we have points with local stable and unstable sets that are not manifolds for @xmath14 , an expansive diffeomorphism defined on a three - dimensional manifold @xmath15 ? we give a positive answer for homeomorphisms .",
    "we also consider robust cw - expansiveness , i.e. , diffeomorphisms in the @xmath0-interior of the set of @xmath0 cw - expansive diffeomorphisms of a compact surface . for @xmath16 ma",
    "@xcite proved that a @xmath17 diffeomorphism of a compact manifold is robustly expansive if and only if it is quasi - anosov ( i.e. , the tangent action is expansive ) .",
    "this result was extended by sakai for cw - expansiveness @xcite and measure expansiveness @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we consider this problem in the @xmath0 topology with @xmath18 .",
    "we introduce a generalization of quasi - anosov diffeomorphisms allowing tangencies between stable and unstable arcs , but controlling the order of contact . in this way we find @xmath0 robustly cw - expansive diffeomorphisms not being quasi - anosov .",
    "these surface diffeomorphisms are in fact robustly @xmath11-expansive ( in the sense of morales ) .",
    "let us now describe the contents of this paper . in section [ sectopdyn ]",
    "we start recalling some basic properties of topological dimension .",
    "we introduce the definition of partially expansive homeomorphism with central dimension @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath19 we prove the equivalence with expansivity ( in the usual sense of utz ) .",
    "for @xmath20 we show that partial expansiveness is equivalent with cw - expansiveness ( in the sense of kato ) . in the smooth category",
    ", it is known that the time - one diffeomorphism of a hyperbolic vector field is partially hyperbolic . in our topological",
    "setting we show that the time - one homeomorphisms of an expansive flow is partially expansive . for a homeomorphism of a compact manifold of dimension @xmath21 , we show that partial expansivity with central dimension @xmath22 is equivalent with what is called as sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "next we consider another definition that we call dw - expansivity .",
    "we show that this definition is stronger than partial expansivity .",
    "we show that the converse does not hold via our previous result related with expansive flows . in the case of vanishing central dimension",
    "we prove that both definitions are equivalent with cw - expansivity .",
    "we also consider positive dw - expansive endomorphisms . we show that every positive expansive endomorphism is positive dw - expansive . via inverse limits we obtain examples of positive dw - expansive homeomorphisms .",
    "in section [ seccwexp ] we consider cw - expansive surface homeomorphisms .",
    "the main result of this section states that every cw - expansive surface homeomorphism without doubly asymptotic sectors is in fact expansive .",
    "this result is based on the work of lewowicz @xcite . in this work he proved that expansive surface homeomorphisms are conjugate with pseudo - anosov diffeomorphisms . in the first part of his article",
    ", it is constructed a local product structure around every point excluding a finite set .",
    "we noticed that the hypothesis of expansivity is used in two ways ( in @xcite ) .",
    "first it is used to prove that there are no lyapunov stable points and then to construct continua of uniform size contained in the local stable set of every point .",
    "after the results of kato on cw - expansive homeomorphisms we know that this can be done only assuming cw - expansivity .",
    "then , in @xcite , expansivity is used to avoid that a local stable continuum meets twice a local unstable continuum .",
    "this is what we call a doubly asymptotic sector . in light of this remarks ,",
    "theorem [ teoequivexp ] is natural .",
    "the techniques of this section are essentially contained in @xcite , but a reorganization of the results allows us to easily exclude the existence of spines .    in section [ secano ] we present examples that limit the extension of the results of the previous section .",
    "an important step in the construction of a local product structure , as before , is to prove that local stable continua are locally connected .",
    "we give an example of a cw - expansive surface homeomorphism with a point whose local stable set is connected but not locally connected .",
    "of course , it has doubly asymptotic sectors .",
    "we also construct an expansive homeomorphism on a three - manifold with similar properties . in both cases there",
    "are wandering points and the ideas are based on the quasi - anosov diffeomorphism that is not anosov defined in @xcite .    in section [ secsta ]",
    "we start recalling known facts related with axiom a diffeomorphisms and with what we call @xmath23-expansivity .",
    "we introduce the definition of @xmath24-anosov @xmath0-diffeomorphisms extending the concept of quasi - anosov diffeomorphism .",
    "we prove that @xmath24-diffeomorphisms are @xmath0-robustly @xmath25-expansive ( @xmath11-expansive in the sense of morales with @xmath26 ) .",
    "in particular they are cw - expansive .",
    "we give an example showing that such diffeomorphisms do exist .",
    "in this section we will introduce two concepts for the dynamics of homeomorphisms on compact metric spaces : partial expansiveness and dimension expansiveness .",
    "the former satisfies that the time - one homeomorphism of an expansive flow is a partially expansive homeomorphism .",
    "the later is related with what can be called the @xmath9-_observable dimension_. both definitions are stated in terms of topological dimension , therefore we will start recalling the definitions and known results .",
