    "it is now twenty years since the publication of the first numerical simulation of a full nova cycle ( prialnik , 1986 ) . during this time modelling of nova outbursts",
    "has advanced significantly and calculations have extended to continuous evolution thorough a series of several cycles ( e.g. , shara et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "extensive parameter studies of the classical nova phenomenon have been carried out by prialnik and kovetz ( 1995 ) and kovetz and prialnik ( 1997 ) , and more recently by yaron et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in parallel ,",
    "computation capability has increased tremendously and thus the computing time required to simulate a full nova cycle has dropped from months to minutes .",
    "models have shown  and observations have confirmed  that the characteristics of a nova outburst are determined by three independent parameters ( schwartzman et al . , 1994 ; prialnik and kovetz , 1994 ; prialnik , 1995 ) .",
    "on the theoretical side , these are the mass and core temperature ( or luminosity ) of the white dwarf ( wd ) , which accretes mass from a binary companion and eventually ignites it explosively and ejects it back into space , and the rate of accretion on to the wd .",
    "changing these parameters independently over the entire ranges allowed by stellar structure theory reproduces the wide range of observed characteristics of novae ( yaron et al .",
    "so far , therefore , the theory of nova outbursts has proved extremely successful . however , the three free parameters are not truly independent .",
    "they are linked by the long - term evolution of the binary system , which changes all of them simultaneously .",
    "thus the question remains whether the entire 3-dimensional parameter space is accessible to nova binary systems .",
    "is it possible for the wd to cool to low temperatures despite repeated outbursts and loss or gain of mass ?",
    "does the wd mass remain the exclusive structural parameter , or is the structure affected on the long - term scale by the events occurring at the surface ?",
    "such questions can only be answered by following the evolution of an accreting wd continuously , not through one or a few nova cycles , but through a thousand such cycles and more .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "long - term unabridged evolutionary calculations through repeated nova outburst cycles require some changes in the evolution code used in previous calculations , which will be described in section  [ method ] .",
    "the results of two computation runs are described and analysed in section  [ ncyc ] , both from the point of view of the outbursts and of the wd on top of which they occur . a brief discussion , summary and conclusions are given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the hydrodynamic lagrangian stellar evolution code used for the calculations presented here was described in some detail by prialnik and kovetz ( 1995 ) .",
    "it includes opal opacities , a nuclear reactions network among 40 heavy element isotopes up to @xmath8p , convection according to the mixing - length theory , diffusion for all elements , accretional heating , and a mass - loss algorithm that applies a steady , optically thick supersonic wind solution .",
    "we note , in particular , that the dynamical phases are calculated by solving the equation of motion along with the energy balance equation ( rather than imposing hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "mass loss is calculated continuously , according to the mass loss rate @xmath9 derived from the optically thick wind solution . at each time step @xmath10",
    ", an amount @xmath11 is subtracted from the outermost mass shell @xmath12 .",
    "time steps are constrained during this phase by the requirement @xmath13 . whenever @xmath12 becomes very small ,",
    "it is merged with the underlying mass shell . in a similar manner , during the accretion phase , an amount @xmath14 is added to the outermost mass shell , and whenever @xmath12 exceeds a prescribed value , the shell is divided into two mass shells .    although thousands of cycles are computed in the present study , each nova cycle , including all evolutionary phases and involving a large network of nuclear reactions , is calculated accurately , with no short - cuts or simplifications .",
    "a detailed description of the changing physical parameters during the evolution of a full nova outburst was given by prialnik ( 1986 ) .",
    "here we refrain from dealing with any single outburst cycle in detail , but focus on the trends of change of typical characteristics and on long - term evolutionary effects .",
    "the spherical grid adopted for the numerical solution , which includes the entire wd , is fixed , except for the outermost grid shells , which may grow or shrink , and be divided or merged , during the accretion and mass - loss episodes of the nova cycle .",
    "the fixed grid is , however , by no means an equally - spaced one .",
    "the masses of shells vary by many orders of magnitude , according to the gradients of various physical properties ( such as temperature , density , element abundances ) that are expected to develop during evolution .",
    "thus , the spatial grid must be prepared in advance in anticipation of the evolutionary course of the stellar model .",
    "in particular , the outer layers of the wd that are expected to take part in the various outburst processes ( diffusion , convection , nuclear burning , acceleration , expansion , ejection , contraction , and so forth ) must be finely zoned . since , as a rule",
    ", each outburst erodes the wd of some mass ( in addition to the accreted mass ) , the grid is set in advance for a prescribed number of nova cycles .",
    "the larger the number of cycles , the larger the grid , and consequently , the larger the computation time .",
    "this was the procedure adopted in former multicycle calculations .",
    "thus the number of cycles was restricted in the original form of the code by the fixed spacial grid of the numerical scheme .",
    "the long - term evolution code should allow an unlimited number of cycles .",
    "a new algorithm is therefore devised whose purpose is to rezone the grid at the beginning of each nova cycle , thereby preparing it for the upcoming evolutionary stages of that cycle .",
    "this numerical process , which involves interpolation on a previous grid , is designed in such a way as to conserve energy and mass of each nuclear species .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium ( which prevails between the dynamical phases of the outburst itself ) is preserved as well .",
    "one of the problems that have to be overcome is the determination of the optimal mass shell size for the outer part of the grid .",
    "since consecutive nova outbursts are very similar ( almost identical ) , this is done at each cycle based on the characteristics of the previous one , namely , the amount of accreted mass and ejected mass , and the depth of the burning shell and convective zone . another problem is to determine the depth of the finely zoned region and the rate at which to gradually increase shell masses until they eventually match the coarsely zoned bulk of the star .",
    "this is achieved by a geometrically increasing series , with a typical factor of 1.25 .",
    "since matrix inversion is required at each iteration of every time - step of the numerical calculation , a compromise must be reached between computing time and resolution ( or accuracy ) .",
    "typically , the grid included between 200 and 400 mass shells for the entire configuration and each continuous  hands - off  run took several weeks of cpu time on a fast pc .    finally , the code is capable of correcting itself in case of failure , by going back to an earlier stage and continuing from that stage with adjusted numerical parameters , such as length of time - step , maximal number of iterations allowed for achieving convergence , and so forth . occasionally , a couple of times per thousand cycles , it does happen that the code goes astray , but it recovers without intervention .",
    "given the complexity of the input physics , in particular the need to interpolate among a large number of opacity tables , this should not be surprising .",
    "such stray points have been removed from the results .",
    "a run spanning thousands of nova outburst cycles produces a prohibitive amount of data , which must be carefully selected , divided among a large number of files , stored , and analysed , mainly by graphical means .",
    "a great deal of information is necessarily lost in the process and can only be retrieved by repeating the calculation .",
    "two evolution runs were carried out , starting from two different initial parameter combinations taken from the extended grid of nova models studied by yaron et al .",
    "we chose a relatively massive wd , of relatively high temperature , accreting at a low rate ( hereafter , model a ) , and a hot , low - mass wd , accreting at a relatively high rate ( hereafter , model b ) . according to prialnik and kovetz ( 1995 ) and yaron et al .",

    "the long - term evolution of the main physical characteristics related to the outbursts that occur on top this accreting wd is shown in figures  [ fig : mzy]-[fig : comp ] .",
    "the top left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mzy ] shows the accreted mass @xmath20 , ejected mass @xmath21 and the mass of the convective envelope that develops after hydrogen ignition @xmath22 .",
    "all three increase with time for the first @xmath23240 cycles , or @xmath24  yr , but stabilize thereafter to a very slow rate of growth . at first",
    ", the ejected mass is almost identical to the envelope mass , which means that the remnant , hydrogen - rich layer at the end of the outburst is very small , and thus the time of decline of the bolometric magnitude is short as well .",
    "we recall that the decline starts when the remnant hydrogen is exhausted . gradually , however , the trend shifts towards the envelope mass being almost equal to the accreted mass , and the ejected mass being larger than both .",
    "this means that wd material is ejected directly during the late stages of mass loss , without being previously mixed with the accreted material .",
    "observationally , this should be reflected by a change in composition of the ejecta , which may be detectable if / when the material ejected earlier becomes transparent .",
    "the reason for this effect is a change within the evolution of the nova outburst .",
    "when most of the mass contained in the convective envelope has been ejected , the star contracts back to almost wd size .",
    "the high ( bolometric ) luminosity persists for a while longer , until the hydrogen in the envelope remnant is burnt out .",
    "when the remnant is massive , however , contraction followed by heating of the hydrogen - rich remnant layer may ignite it explosively again , which will lead to a second mass loss episode , so that the entire original envelope and even some additional wd material will be ejected .",

    "the integration is carried over the entire mass loss phase of the cycle . the ejecta average metallicity @xmath31 decreases with repeated cycles , as the accreted mass increases . at the same time the helium mass fraction @xmath32 increases , but both reach a plateau after 240 cycles , when the accreted and ejected masses stabilize as well . at this stage ,",
    "the breakdown of @xmath31 into the most abundant elements is : n - 0.09 , o - 0.08 , and c - 0.04 .",
    "the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath33 is a direct consequence of the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , explained above : @xmath34 , when during the secondary mass loss episode , wd material ( @xmath35 ) that was not previously mixed with the accreted material , is ejected as well .",
    "the maximal temperature attained at outburst reaches a maximum of about @xmath36  k around the 400th cycle and declines very slowly thereafter .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of this long - term calculation is the relatively sharp transition from fast nova outbursts  for roughly the first 200 cycles  to moderately fast nova outbursts from the 250th outburst onwards , as shown by the duration of the mass loss episode plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vtml ] . even more intriguing is the behaviour of the average expansion velocity , shown in the upper panel : as the fast nova outbursts progress , the velocity goes through a maximum and settles to an almost constant value of about 500  km  s@xmath3 for the moderately fast outbursts .",
    "it thus appears that fast novae may exhibit a range of expansion velocities ranging between 500 and 2500  km  s@xmath3 , while slower ones should have typically lower velocities .",
    "we should bear in mind , however , that a low average velocity may still allow much higher peak velocities for short periods of time .",
    "of course , these conclusions relate to outbursts obtained for a 1  @xmath4 wd and may change with the wd mass .",
    "the isotopic ratios shown in fig .  [ fig : comp ] undergo a similar evolution : a changing , non - monotonic pattern along the first 250 fast nova cycles , settling down to constant ratios for most of the evolution .",
    "we note significant overabundances of @xmath37c and @xmath38o , compared to solar abundances ( taken from lodders , 2003 ) , a somewhat lower overabundance of @xmath39n , while @xmath40o is underabundant .",
    "we also note that for the first few tens of outbursts the trends of change are different and variable .",

    "the total mass transferred to it by accretion amounted to @xmath49 , which is of the order of a typical red dwarf binary companion mass .",
    "thus , in spite of the relatively short evolution time , the companion mass may have been exhausted by its end .",
    "the long - term evolution of the main physical characteristics related to nova outbursts that occur on top this accreting wd is shown in figures  [ fig : mzy065 ] and [ fig : comp065 ] . here , due to the high accretion rate , the evolutionary timescale is much shorter ; thus , for example , 1000 cycles which spanned @xmath50  yr for model a , take only @xmath51  yr for model b. the times are not precisely inversely proportional to the corresponding accretion rates because the accreted masses required for outbursts to be triggered depend on the wd mass .    the striking difference between models a and b , which is immediately obvious from the comparison of figs .  [",

    "previous studies , even if they considered several cycles , did not span a sufficient fraction of the wd evolutionary timescale for answering this question . an indication that the wd core may continue to cool despite the heat generated by nova outbursts was given by prialnik ( 1987 ) .",

    "for the 1  @xmath4 wd ( model a ) , the accreting wd cools at the same rate as the single one for a period of @xmath24  yr ( equivalent to about 250 cycles ) , but then the cooling trend slows down and the wd core tends to a constant temperature of @xmath53  k. the evolutionary timescale for model b is short compared to the cooling timescale of a wd , hence the cooling curves are still close even after several thousand cycles , which amount to only a few @xmath54  yr . the luminosities of the cooling wd and of the accreting wd in quiescence ( during the accretion episodes separating outbursts ) are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : tl ] .",
    "the luminosity of the accreting wd has two sources : the heat emanated by the cooling wd core and the energy imparted by accretion , known as accretion luminosity , given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is taken to be @xmath57 , following regev and shara ( 1989 ) .",
    "the outer layers of the wd adjust so as to re - emit this influx of energy , in a similar manner to an irradiated star ( kovetz et al .",
    "we note that only at the beginning , while the wd core is still relatively hot , does the core luminosity exceed the accretion luminosity .    in order to understand the thermal evolution of the wd , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : proft ] temperature profiles at various times during evolution ( marked by the cycle number ) .",
    "all profiles correspond to the end of a nova cycle , just before the onset of a new accretion episode .",
    "thus the configuration includes the wd and the eventual remnant of the envelope at the end of the mass loss phase . at first , for several hundred cycles , the temperature gradient is negative everywhere .",
    "gradually , however , the outer layers of the wd , well beneath the outermost one that is directly affected by the outburst ( mainly through diffusion , which changes its composition ) , are heated and a temperature inversion develops",
    ". nevertheless , for many additional cycles , this temperature `` wall '' does not prevent the core from cooling , since the temperature still decreases between the centre and the inversion zone .",
    "but the slope of the core temperature profile slowly decreases and finally flattens . at this stage",
    "the wd core ceases to cool .",
    "it may subsequently start to heat up , but for this to happen , more than a hubble time seems to be required for the massive wd , and several thousand additional nova cycles ( that is , a massive companion ) for the less massive one . in conclusion , the shape and evolution of the temperature profiles explains the difference ( or similarity ) between the cooling curves of an accreting and an undisturbed wd , shown in fig .",

    "the reason for this behaviour lies in the competition between the already mentioned cooling of the core , which drives the density up , and decrease of the wd mass ( shown in the upper panels of fig .",

    "we have chosen two very different combinations of wd mass and accretion rate in order to test these two types of effect .",
    "the main results and conclusions reached may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the wd physical parameters change considerably with time in both cases , in particular : 1 .",
    "the wd cools as a single , undisturbed wd for a while , but after a time , cooling slows down and will eventually cease .",
    "the maximum temperature attained in the burning shell @xmath95 increases at first , but settles at an almost constant value as cooling of the wd slows down .",
    "the wd luminosity decreases with time , but in contrast to a single wd , only down to the accretion luminosity value , where it remains constant .",
    "this , of course , applies only to the quiescent phases of accretion between outbursts .",
    "the wd mass decreases steadily for the cases considered , but not by much .",
    "the mass of the donor star , by contrast , decreases considerably : by 0.16  @xmath4 for model a , and by 0.51  @xmath4 for model b. 4 .",
    "the wd becomes less dense as its mass decreases , as expected from the relation @xmath96 characteristic of degenerate stars .",
    "2 .   on the long - term scale ,",
    "the outburst characteristics change considerably for the massive wd ( model a ) , but only slightly for the low - mass one ( model b ) .",
    "in particular : 1 .",
    "the accreted and ejected masses increase with time , as the wd temperature decreases .",
    "the heavy element abundance ( @xmath97 ) decreases with time for model a , while it oscillates around a constant value for model b. 3 .",
    "the helium mass fraction increases with time for model a , while again , it oscillates around a constant value for model b. 4 .",
    "isotopic ratios settle eventually into constant values for model a and are practically constant throughout for model b. in both cases @xmath37c and @xmath38o are overabundant as compared to solar values , while @xmath40o is underabundant ; @xmath39n , however , is overabundant in one case ( a ) and underabundant in the other ( b ) .",
    "the changes in physical characteristics are not necessarily monotonic ; some , such as the expansion velocity , go through an extremum .",
    "consequently , one should be careful when using parametrised grids of models and interpolating between them . nevertheless , the agreement between the long - term calculations and the parametrised models is quite good for many of the nova characteristics .",
    "both models settle , eventually , into almost steady state where both the wd properties and the outburst characteristics remain almost unchanged with many repeated cycles .",
    "however , this state is reached after hundreds of cycles , which means a long period of time , or a considerable change in the mass of the donor star . although our calculations assume a constant accretion rate throughout , it is to be expected that spurious dynamical effects on the binary orbit that are bound to occur on a long timescale , or the change in donor mass , or both , will affect the mass transfer rate significantly .",
    "a different accretion rate will tend to a different steady state .",
    "it is thus possible that , in reality , the system will never be able to achieve steady state .",
    "5 .   for the first time in numerical modelling of nova outbursts , it is possible to estimate the accuracy ( or reliability ) of the results .",
    "the numerical `` noise '' that appears in the various plots may be statistically interpreted as error bars .    of the 3 independent nova parameters ,",
    "only 2 are left  the wd mass and the accretion rate  while the third  the wd temperature  is determined by the evolutionary course of the accreting wd in the nova system .",
    "the present calculations were based on the arbitrary assumption that the accretion rate is constant ( and prescribed ) .",
    "this assumption is not realistic ; the evolutionary course of the nova system , taking into account the interaction between its components , determines the mass transfer rate and its evolution , and future studies should follow the evolution of both members of the binary system consistently .",
    "this leaves the wd mass as the single truly independent parameter of nova outburst evolution .",
    "we are grateful to mike shara for refusing to accept that such a calculation as presented here should be impossible to perform .",
    "we wish to thank an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions and comments .",
