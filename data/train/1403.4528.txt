    "this is important since this data gives constraints on the model parameters  constraints that must be consistent with neutrino oscillation data  which will results in a large impact on the final results .    in the following ,",

    "in the bayesian interpretation , probability is associated with the _ plausibility _ or _ credibility _ of a proposition .",
    "perhaps the main goal of science is to infer which model or hypothesis best describes a certain set of collected data .",
    "also , these models should preferably be `` simple '' or `` economical '' in some sense . if one accepts the bayesian interpretation of probability , a very powerful arsenal of inference tools become available . in a nutshell ,",
    "the idea is to use the laws of probability to calculate the probabilities of different hypotheses or models , when conditioned on some known ( or presumed ) information .",
    "if the collected data is denoted by @xmath9 and the set of considered hypotheses or models is @xmath10 , bayes theorem gives the plausibilities of each of the hypotheses after considering the data , the _ posterior probabilities _",
    ", @xmath11 here , the _ evidence _ @xmath12 is the probability of the data , assuming the model @xmath13 to be true , while @xmath14 is the _ prior probability _ of @xmath13 , which is how plausible @xmath13 is before considering the data .",
    "@xmath15 is the probability of the data without assuming any particular model .",
    "one can then perform _ model comparison _ by calculating ratios of posterior probabilities , the _ posterior odds _",
    ", of two models as @xmath16 in words , the posterior odds is given by the _",
    "prior odds _",
    "@xmath17 multiplied by the _ bayes factor _ @xmath18 , which quantifies how much better @xmath13 describes that data than @xmath19 .",
    "the prior odds quantifies how much more plausible one model is than the other a priori , i.e. , without considering the data .",
    "if there is no reason to favor one of the models over the other , the prior odds should be taken to equal unity ( in which case the posterior odds equals the bayes factor ) , but sometimes one must consider this point more carefully .    if the model contains free parameters @xmath20 , the evidence is given by = ( |m ) & = & ( , |m)d^n + & = & ( | , m ) ( |m)d^n + & = & d^n .",

    "it should always be normalized , i.e. , integrate to unity .",
    "the assignment of priors are probably the most discussed and controversial part of bayesian inference .",
    "this assignment is often far from trivial , but constitutes a very important part of any bayesian analysis .",
    "one observes that the evidence is the average of the likelihood over the prior , and hence this method automatically implements a form of _ occam s razor _ , since in general a more predictive model with a smaller parameter space will have a larger evidence than a less predictive one , unless the latter can fit the data substantially better .",
    "the probabilities of the different hypotheses give the complete posterior inference on the space of models , and these have a somewhat unique and meaningful interpretation on their own .",

    "this will not change any conclusions as long as the widths of these gaussians are taken small enough ( so that all priors are effectively constant over these widths ) .",

    "@xcite : the inverted mass ordering is typically linked to a maximal value of the solar angle , in contrast with the observations .",
    "we first focus on the posterior distributions in all the models .",
    "however , since @xmath29 is really the only parameter of interest , and its marginal posteriors are at least not very far from being gaussian , we only consider the posterior means and standard deviations ( which closely matches the posterior medians and 68% credible intervals ) .",
    "the inclusion of the charged lepton data is particularly important since , by themselves , they can give strong constraints on @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , the same preferred values of @xmath33 must be used when fitting the neutrino data .",
    "in general , we expect naive estimates as [ eq : naive ] ( ) ^1/(n^_1+n^_1 ) ( ) ^1/(n^_2+n^_2 ) , where @xmath64 are the @xmath42 factors entering the yukawa matrix as defined in eq .  .",

    "the combined uncertainty is somewhat smaller than the naive expectation , and for the model @xmath32 the posterior mean is smaller than all the three partial estimates .",
    "however , the naive combination is expected to be valid only when all the individual constraints are gaussian and there are no common nuisance parameters . in the present case , we do see some non - guassian features of the posteriors , and there are 30 common nuisance parameters whose correlations can invalidate the naive combination .    finally , we note that no constraints on @xmath29 can be obtained in a standard @xmath8-analysis in which the @xmath8 is minimized ( or likelihood maximized ) over the remaining parameters .",
    "all the models can fit the data equally well , i.e. , perfectly , for any non - zero values of @xmath29 .",
    "however , depending on the value of @xmath29 , the fit would require more or less fine - tuning among the @xmath42 parameters .",

    "these are of course just what is expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive ] ) when the doublet charges are allowed to be non - zero .",
    "in particular , the extra suppression from the doublet charges requires @xmath29 to be larger in @xmath80 than @xmath78 for fixed singlet charges , while the ratio @xmath104 is smaller , around 2 .",
    "most of the posterior probability is assigned to @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "two of these combinations were considered in the sec .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath110 and @xmath106 were the doublet charges of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 models in sec .",

    "furthermore , the charges for the singlets must typically be larger in @xmath115 than in @xmath116 .",
    "this mainly follows from the fact that the doublet charges together with @xmath29 are essentially used to fit four observables ( the three mixing angles and the ratio @xmath117 ) , while the singlet charges are used to fit only two ( the mass hierarchies of the charged leptons ) .",
    "then , the non - zero doublet charges require @xmath29 to not be very small so that only a mild hierarchy in the neutrino sector is achieved . therefore , in order to fit the charged lepton data , larger singlet charges are preferred in @xmath115 than in @xmath116 .      similarly as in sec .

    "sec : specificu1 ] , no parameter constraint can be extracted and no model comparison can be performed from a @xmath8 analysis . indeed for any given value of the charges , and indeed for any fixed tuple @xmath118 , the data can always be fitted perfectly . the comparison among @xmath80 and @xmath78",
    "is then performed on posteriors and evidences .    the evidence of a model @xmath119 with free charges @xmath120 is given by ( |m ) = _ c ( |c , m)(n|m ) = _ c _ c ( c ) and so the full evidence is the average of the evidences with fixed charges over the prior on the charges .",
    "hence , a model with a large number of unspecified charges can have a small evidence if a large portion of those charges does not predict the data accurately , even if there is some specific combination of charges which predict the data well .    for our default choice of priors with @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ", the comparison of @xmath80 and @xmath78 yields a bayes factor = ( _ _ g/__g ) = 1.7 , which means that the hierarchical model is weakly preferred compared to the anarchical one . the uncertainty on the value reported in the previous equation , as on all the bayes factors in this section , is about @xmath72 .",
    "bayes factors can often depend crucially on the priors employed , in particular when the parameter in question only appears in one of the models .",
    "since the doublet charges are free parameters only in @xmath121 , it is then important to check whether the results discussed above are stable under different assumptions on the priors .",

    "for the prior on @xmath29 , we have varied the value of @xmath74 , that in the previous section was fixed at @xmath127 . since @xmath29 is a free parameter of all models , the impact on the evidence is in general expected to be small . as long as @xmath74 is smaller than the smallest value preferred by any model",

    "@xmath94 is already small enough for this limit to be well approximated ( we have also checked this numerically ) , and so we do not show any results for smaller @xmath74 . as @xmath129 , @xmath130 becomes a uniform distribution .",
    "we find the following .",
    "* geometric charge priors * + for small @xmath74 the evidence for @xmath78 does not really depend on @xmath88 , which is expected since in this case charges of all magnitudes are roughly equally good ( along the degeneracy ) . however , for @xmath74 with a uniform prior ( i.e. large @xmath74 ) , larger @xmath88 gives larger evidence : indeed large @xmath33 , and so larger charges , are preferred .    for @xmath80 ,",
    "the effect of varying @xmath88 is in most cases very small , regardless of the prior on @xmath29 .",
    "if only the prior on the doublet charges is made wider , the evidence decreases ( since small charges predict the data better ) , and vice versa .",
    "if only the prior on the singlet charges is made wider , the evidence instead increases , and vice versa . since the priors are the same on both sets of charges , these effect partially cancel , leaving only small changes in the evidence .",
    "since large @xmath29 is preferred in @xmath80 , the uniform prior gives a larger evidence .",

    "uniform charge priors * + for the uniform prior on the charges , much more prior is put on large values of the charges , especially for large @xmath124 .",
