    "the initial model consists of two delay equations , one for the density of proliferating cells , @xmath1 , and one for the density of so - called  resting  cells , @xmath2 .",
    "the latter equation is independent , hence it can be studied independently ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "equation is this second equation , with the unknown @xmath2 made dimensionless by dividing it by a quantity with the same dimension .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 are positive real numbers",
    ". we do not insist here on their physical significance since this is largely presented in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "parameter @xmath4 is of the form @xmath5 , with @xmath6 positive .",
    "we take here , as in @xcite , @xmath4 as an independent parameter , instead of @xmath6 .",
    "note that , due to its definition , @xmath7 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the vector of five parameters ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the equilibrium points of the problem are , as can be easily seen ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath10 the second one is acceptable from the biological point of view if and only if @xmath11 condition that implies @xmath12    the equilibrium point @xmath13 presents hopf bifurcation for some points in the parameter space @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite we developed the apparatus for investigating the normal form for a hopf bifurcation point , by using the center manifold theory ( we needed a second order approximation of the center manifold for this ) . in order to determine the normal form",
    ", we computed the first lyapunov coefficient , @xmath14 .",
    "in @xcite we searched for points of degenerate hopf bifurcation , i.e. points @xmath15 in the parameter space with @xmath16 the method used relied also on the center manifold theory .",
    "we explored a quite extended zone of parameters , having biological significance , and found that for @xmath17 and each @xmath18 , values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be found , for which @xmath21 we went further , and for these points we computed the second lyapunov coefficient , by constructing a fourth order approximation of the center manifold .",
    "for all the points @xmath15 with @xmath22 determined , we found @xmath23 and thus , by the definition in @xcite , @xmath24 represent hopf points of codimension two",
    ".    in the present paper we numerically investigate the occurrence of bautin bifurcation in one of the hopf points of codimension two found .",
    "in @xcite we considered the restriction of the problem to a two - dimensional center manifold , this restriction is a two - dimensional problem and the theory of @xcite works for its study .",
    "some ideas concerning the restriction of the problem to the center manifold are presented here , in section 2 .    in section 3",
    "we describe the bautin bifurcation for two dimensional dynamical systems , as it is presented in @xcite .",
    "then we chose a point in the parameter space for which @xmath25 and we explore its neighborhood in order to see whether we regain the bifurcation diagram of the bautin bifurcation for our problem .",
    "for this , we numerically integrate our problem for the chosen parameters . as the graphs of the trajectories obtained by numerical integration show",
    ", we have indeed a bautin bifurcation in the chosen hopf point of codimension two ( section 4 ) .",
    "in @xcite we considered the nontrivial equilibrium point @xmath13 and the linearized equation around this point , that is ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath26z(t)+kb_1z(t - r),\\ ] ] where @xmath27 @xmath28 , and @xmath29    the characteristic equation corresponding to is @xmath30    the eigenvalues depend on the vector of parameters , @xmath8 .",
    "assume that we have a point @xmath15 in the parameters space such that , for @xmath8 in a neighborhood @xmath31 of @xmath32 there are two eigenvalues , that we denote by @xmath33 with the property that all other eigenvalues have negative real part , and , at @xmath34 @xmath35    the analysis in @xcite shows that @xmath36 satisfies the above condition if and only if the relation @xmath37 is satisfied , where @xmath38 is the value of @xmath39 at @xmath40    for @xmath41 , a two - dimensional local invariant manifold ( the local center manifold ) exists and the reduction of the problem to this manifold leads to the ordinary differential equation :    @xmath42    where @xmath43    the formalism for the construction of an approximation of the center manifold and that for computing the coefficients @xmath44 are fully presented in @xcite .",
    "we remind here only some elements of that construction , that relies on the general ideas in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we considered the banach space @xmath45\\mapsto \\mathbb{r},\\ , \\psi\\ , \\mathrm{is\\ , continuous\\ , on\\,}[-r,0 ]   \\right\\},\\ ] ] and its complexification , denoted @xmath46 we denoted by @xmath47 the subspace of @xmath48 spanned by the two eigenfunctions @xmath49,$ ] corresponding to the two eigenvalues @xmath50 and by @xmath51 a projector defined on @xmath52 with values in @xmath47 .",
    "the local center manifold is locally invariant , tangent to @xmath47 in 0 .",
    "it is the graph of a smooth function @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is a neighborhood of 0 in @xmath47 ) that satisfies @xmath55 thus a `` point '' @xmath56 on the center manifold has the form @xmath57    for an initial condition @xmath56 on the center manifold , the solution @xmath58 of equation satisfies @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61,$ ] @xmath62 is the solution of equation with the initial condition @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath65 , the two eigenvalues @xmath66 may have positive or negative real part .",
    "in each of these situations , there still is a two - dimensional local invariant manifold , a local unstable manifold when @xmath67 , and a submanifold of the local stable manifold for @xmath68 .",
    "this latter case can be argued with the ideas of @xcite , adapted to the more simple case considered by us .",
    "hence the solution of our problem has in this case also a representation of the form @xmath69 where u satisfies an equation of the form @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the function whose graph is the local invariant manifold .",
    "the above considerations show that the problem ( respectively ) presents , for some initial value , a periodic solution iff the corresponding solution @xmath72 of is periodic",
    ". also , a solution of ( respectively ) spirals towards 0 ( or from 0 ) , iff the corresponding solution of spirals towards ( respectively from 0 ) .",
    "hence the study of equations , from the point of view of the hopf or bautin bifurcation leads to complete conclusions concerning these bifurcations for the problem .",
    "consider a system of two odes , that can be written as a single complex equation as @xmath73 where @xmath74            in order to describe the phase portrait for the parameters varying around the point @xmath75 ( equivalent to @xmath89 ) it is useful to consider the polar form of the above equation : + @xmath90 @xmath91 + the limit cycles are obtained by solving the equation : @xmath92 and , by studying the number of its solutions as function of @xmath93 , the bifurcation diagram of the bautin bifurcation is obtained .",
    "we see that in a neighborhood of the origin in the plane of the parameters @xmath95 the phase portrait in a neighborhood of @xmath96 has very different aspects .",
    "these are described in @xcite , but for the sake of completeness , we point out a few ideas here . in the zone 1 of the bautin bifurcation diagram , that lies between the @xmath97 part of the axis @xmath98 and the curve @xmath99 , the point @xmath96 is an attractive focus ; when we cross the axis @xmath98 entering in the zone 2 ( the half - plane @xmath100 ) , a supercritical hopf bifurcation takes place and a stable limit cycle occurs , while the point @xmath96 loses stability ; then , starting from the first quadrant , when we cross the axis @xmath98 to arrive in the zone 3 ( lying between the @xmath101 part of the axis @xmath98 and the curve @xmath99 ) , a subcritical hopf bifurcation takes place , and an unstable limit cycle is born , in the interior of that previously formed . then , for the parameters @xmath102 on the curve @xmath99 , the two cycle collide in a single cycle , that is repulsive on its interior side and attractive on its exterior side , and after crossing the curve @xmath99 , arriving in the zone 1 again , the two cycles disappear .    hence , the most interesting feature of this bifurcation is the presence of two limit cycles one inside the other for the parameters lying between the axis @xmath98 and the curve t. the exterior cycle is stable ( attractive ) while the interior one is unstable ( repulsive ) .",
    "we have chosen the case @xmath103 that is not among those found in @xcite .",
    "we took this case hoping to have a small @xmath19 at the bautin bifurcation and intending to have the second lyapunov coefficient not very close to zero ( this choice is justified by the table contained in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) .      in order to see if we can regain the bifurcation diagram above for our problem , we performed numerical integrations of the delay differential equation for the above values of @xmath107 and values of @xmath108 around @xmath109 we used the routine dde23 of matlab .          in order to put into light the behavior of the solution , that is qualitatively described in the bifurcation diagram , for a chosen point in the parameters space",
    ", we have to take several initial functions situated at different distances from the equilibrium point .",
    "we took the initial function @xmath56 of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the eigenvalues of the linearized problem at the chosen parameters , and @xmath115 is a new parameter , that we vary .",
    "we consider first the solutions for two points @xmath117 in the zone of the @xmath118 plane , corresponding to the zone 1 of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "more precisely the point @xmath119 has the coordinates @xmath120 while for @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .",
    "the behavior of the solution for these two points is that corresponding to an attracting focus .",
    "since we obtained qualitatively the same image for several values of @xmath115 , we represent only one of these , that for @xmath122 , in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "5 - 6 that a stable limit cycle occurs by hopf bifurcation . in these two figures we present the behavior of the solution corresponding to @xmath125 and @xmath126",
    "respectively @xmath127 . in figs . 7 and 8",
    "we present the behavior of the solution corresponding to @xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively @xmath130 .",
    "we remark that at each oscillation , on this limit cycle , at the end of a descending branch , in the @xmath131 versus @xmath132 representations , a small superposed oscillation occurs , that produces a little spiral in the left of the @xmath131 versus @xmath133 representation .",
    "the moment when the solutions enters on this limit cycle depends on the distance between the initial function and @xmath13 .",
    "it was very difficult to find a point in the parameter plane , presenting the behavior corresponding to that of zone 3 of the bifurcation diagram .",
    "we suppose this is so because of the curve @xmath99 that is deformed and may be very close to the curve @xmath111 .",
    "however , we found that for the point @xmath134 the behavior of the solution is the following : for initial functions close to @xmath13 , that is @xmath135 the solution spirals towards @xmath13 , while for @xmath136 it is visible that the solution spirals away from a repulsive limit cycle , having increasing ( with time ) amplitude .",
    "when time increases , the solution tends to a large attractive limit cycle ( that was previously formed by hopf bifurcation when passing from zone 1 to zone 2 ) .",
    "this types of behavior are shown in figs .",
    "9 - 13 where we took @xmath137 in figs . 10 and 11",
    "the repulsive limit cycle is clearly visible , while in figs .",
    "12 and 13 the exterior attractive cycle is present .                    hence , by numerical integrations we confirmed that the bautin bifurcation , predicted by theoretical considerations , actually takes place , for the considered differential delay equation , in one of the points with @xmath138    it is important to remark that a consequence of the bautin bifurcation is , for a certain zone in the parameter space , the occurrence of a repulsive limit cycle inside an attractive one .",
    "there , the behavior of the solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) strongly depends on the initial function .",
    "if the initial function is close to the equilibrium point @xmath13 , the solution spirals towards @xmath139 while if the initial function is `` far '' from @xmath13 , it will spiral towards the exterior stable limit cycle . from the point of view of the studied illness",
    "these two behaviors are quite different and this shows the importance of being able to control the initial condition .",
