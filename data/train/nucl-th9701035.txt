    "the determination of the phase structure of strongly interacting matter is one of the major challenges in theory and experiment . in our contribution",
    "we study the phase transition from hadrons to a quark - gluon plasma in asymmetric matter . based on a two - phase model",
    "we describe new qualitative features that arise as a function of the isospin and that may be relevant for the phenomenological description of highly energetic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the creation of the quark - gluon plasma and the elucidation of its properties is the fundamental goal in relativistic heavy  ion physics .",
    "although experiments at the brookhaven ags and at the cern sps have provided evidence that in highly energetic collisions an intermediate state is formed which is characterized by very high energy densities @xcite , it is not clear if this new phase of matter has actually been reached ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .    on the theoretical side the determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and densities is a major problem in qcd .",
    "one of the most important issues here is revealing the phase diagram of matter and the nature of the transition .",
    "most reliable results come from lattice calculations for systems at zero baryon density ( for an updated status report see @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations clearly indicate a first - order transition for pure @xmath0 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "when dynamical quarks are added the situation is less transparent .",
    "the nature of the transition not only depends on the number of flavors but also on their masses @xcite , particularly on the mass of the strange quark .",
    "for example , three light flavors show a first - order transition that is absent for larger masses @xcite . despite the need of corresponding information in applications to heavy ",
    "ion collisions , lattice calculations at finite baryon density presently remain at an early stage without a definite conclusion @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , there are no lattice calculations available for asymmetric systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , systems at finite baryon density and with nonzero isospin .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated in case of the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter that asymmetric systems have qualitatively different properties than symmetric systems @xcite . in particular , the transition in an asymmetric system is _ continuous _ and of second order according to ehrenfest s definition , in contrast to the discontinuous , first - order transition in symmetric systems . the goal of the present work is to extend these studies to the deconfinement phase transition of asymmetric matter .",
    "since lattice calculations can not provide the required information at present , we resort to a separate description of the hadronic and the quark - gluon phase .",
    "this approach is not new and was previously employed to investigate the existence of quark cores in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "although such a formulation oversimplifies the full complexity of the problem , it is useful for providing a first orientation to the new features that arise when a system with two conserved charges , _",
    "i.e. _ , baryon number and isospin , undergoes a transition .",
    "the eos for the quark - gluon phase is based on a simple `` bag model '' , where the thermodynamic potential is modeled as a sum of a perturbative contribution and a nonperturbative part which is represented by the bag constant . along these lines",
    "we adopt a model which is based on two massless flavors and which includes the first - order correction in the strong coupling constant @xmath1 @xcite .    the hadronic eos is generated in a relativistic mean - field approach involving the interaction of dirac nucleons with isoscalar scalar and vector meson fields and with isovector @xmath2 meson and pion fields @xcite . the central object in this approach is an energy functional of the meson mean fields , which , in principle , can be formulated without reference to an explicit lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in numerous applications that this type of model provides an excellent description of nuclear matter and of bulk nuclear properties throughout the periodic table .",
    "thus we can calibrate our hadronic equation of state at zero temperature and normal nuclear densities , and then extrapolate into the regime of high density and temperature appropriate for the phase transition .",
    "the model we study involves cubic and quartic isoscalar self - couplings .",
    "although nonlinear @xmath2 meson interactions are possible @xcite , the nuclear symmetry energy is achieved using the simplest possible coupling of the @xmath2 meson field to the nucleon .",
    "the pions are incorporated by adding their one - body contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ , the contribution of an ideal bose gas with an effective chemical potential , to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the effective chemical potential is chosen such that the @xmath2 meson field couples to the total isospin density , which receives a contribution from nucleons and pions .    at low temperatures , the qualitative features studied here",
    "depend strongly on the nuclear symmetry energy . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the inclusion of the pions is crucial due to the onset of a pion condensate in very asymmetric systems .",
    "the pions are incorporated in a very simple manner .",
    "generally the isovector dependence of the hadronic eos may be more complicated than in our model ; however , these properties are not well known , particularly when one is far from symmetric matter . in this context",
    "it is important to realize that the hadronic model is formulated in terms of effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the two conserved charges , baryon number and total isospin , are the relevant quantities in the thermodynamic analysis whereas the particle numbers of the individual species may change when parameters , _ e.g.",
    "_ , temperature and pressure , vary . in the present case",
    "the pion condensed phase resembles closely matter containing @xmath3-resonances , which we could include in our model as well as other unstable nucleon resonances .",
    "however , we expect that this will not change the qualitative features of the eos , since it depends only on the _ total _ baryon number and isospin .",
    "although our eos can be calibrated very accurately at zero temperature and normal nuclear densities , the extrapolation into the regime of high densities is not unique . in the context of neutron star calculations",
    "it has recently been demonstrated @xcite that the high density eos is sensitive to combinations of parameters that are difficult to calibrate at normal densities . as a consequence ,",
    "large uncertainties in the predictions arise .",
    "the density regime where the transition of hadronic matter to a quark ",
    "gluon plasma takes place corresponds to the interior region of a neutron star .",
    "therefore similar difficulties can be expected .",
    "although this limits the quantitative results of our analysis , the qualitative features of the basic physics remain unchanged .",
    "studies of the deconfinement phase transition in terms of a separate description of the two phases have a long history in the literature .",
    "in particular , in the context of neutron star matter , many calculations similar to ours have been performed earlier @xcite . the first analysis which considered the transition in a system with two conserved charges",
    "was performed by glendenning @xcite , with the restriction to zero temperature and to neutron star matter , _",
    "i.e. _ , matter in beta - decay equilibrium . along these lines",
    "the effect of neutrino trapping on the composition of cold protoneutron stars with quark cores has been investigated more recently @xcite .",
    "we will extend the analysis to systems at arbitrary temperature , baryon density and isospin . by definition",
    ", the two - phase model can not reveal the actual nature of the transition .",
    "in contrast , other phenomenological approaches which are directly inspired by the symmetries of qcd , for example linear sigma models @xcite , have been applied to shed more light on the fundamental properties of the transition .",
    "however , whether it is of first or second order or a cross - over phenomenon can only be established by full qcd studies , _ i.e. _ , by lattice calculations .",
    "we believe that , until this information is available , our approach is useful for providing a first orientation of the qualitative features which arise in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at finite baryon density and isospin . at zero baryon density",
    "the two - phase model implies a first - order transition . starting from there our results are qualitatively similar to what was found in case of the liquid ",
    "gas phase transition of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "primarily , the transition of hadrons to quarks and gluons in asymmetric systems is of _ second order _ , in contrast to the first - order transition that occurs in symmetric matter ( which behaves like a one - component system ) .",
    "that means that some thermodynamic variables , _ e.g. _ , the entropy , are continuous and smooth throughout the transition , whereas the first - order transition is characterized by discontinuities in these quantities .",
    "furthermore , we find that the transition regime in terms of densities and temperatures varies significantly with the isospin of the system .",
    "in particular the density at the onset of the transition is always lower in asymmetric matter .",
    "this result led us to the conclusion that it is more likely that the transition region is reached in collisions of very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly summarize the general discussion of phase transitions in multicomponent systems which can be found in greater detail in ref .",
    "we focus on the new aspects which arise when a thermodynamic system is described by two different equations of state . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the models for the two phases and summarize the relations that determine the equation of state . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply our model to the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we study the phase coexistence region and illustrate different thermodynamic processes by the aid of various phase diagrams and maxwell constructions .",
    "we consider special situations which arise during ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we also discuss the parameter dependence of the thermodynamic features .",
    "v contains a short summary .",
    "we consider a system characterized by a set of @xmath4 mutually commuting charges @xmath5 .",
    "the thermodynamic features of such a system have been discussed earlier @xcite in connection with the liquid - gas phase transition of asymmetric nuclear matter . here",
    "we will focus on the situation where the system can exist in two phases each characterized by a _",
    "different _ equation of state .",
    "the partition function might be generated by a hamiltonian which is formulated in terms of different degrees of freedom in each phase @xcite .",
    "for example , the elementary constituents ( quarks and gluons ) would be used in the first phase and composite particles ( hadrons ) in the second . as mentioned in the introduction , it is important to keep in mind that the conserved _ charges _ are the relevant quantities in the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "a conserved charge does not necessarily imply an independent particle species which may change during a process ( by decay , for example ) ; it includes any conserved quantity resulting from the underlying symmetries of the system , for example , isospin , baryon number , electric charge , _ etc . _    to describe the equilibrium state of the system in phase @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) enclosed in a volume @xmath8 we choose the helmholtz free energy @xmath9 @xmath10 with @xmath11 depending on the value of the free energy the system will be realized in one phase or the other or in a mixture of both , indicating a phase transition . to be more precise ,",
    "the system in phase @xmath6 will be stable against separation into two phases if the free energy of the single phase @xmath6 is lower than the free energy in all two - phase configurations .",
    "this requirement can be formulated as @xmath12 with @xmath13 note that this also implies @xmath14 so if eq .",
    "( [ eq : stab1 ] ) is satisfied , phase @xmath6 is not only stable against phase separation , it is also the energetically favorable single - phase configuration .",
    "we assume that each single phase by itself describes a stable configuration to be the free energy resulting from a maxwell construction in the unstable region , which is convex . ] , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : stab1 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the free energy in each phase is a convex function of the densities @xcite .",
    "the last equation ( [ eq : c1 ] ) ensures that the overall charges are conserved : @xmath16    equation ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) is a _",
    "criterion for the stability of a one - phase configuration . whenever it is violated",
    ", a system with two phases is energetically favorable .",
    "the phase coexistence is governed by the gibbs conditions @xcite demanding equal pressure @xmath17 , temperature @xmath18 and chemical potentials @xmath19 in both phases @xmath20 it is important to realize , however , that under conditions of phase separation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stab1 ] ) may still be valid _ locally _ , that means , in some small region @xmath21 of parameter space , but it may nevertheless be possible to find significantly different densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 in a larger domain @xmath24 that violate this condition .",
    "this leads to the existence of metastable states .",
    "the two sets of densities @xmath25 that satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) form a surface in the parameter space @xmath26 ; this is the phase separation boundary , or binodal .",
    "for @xmath4 conserved charges and two coexisting phases , gibbs phase rule implies that the binodal is an @xmath4-dimensional surface @xcite .",
    "it can also be shown that this surface encloses all points that lead to a single ( unstable ) configuration with a higher value for the free energy @xcite .",
    "the binodal surface determines the stability boundaries of the system .",
    "the mixed phase inside must be determined by a maxwell construction .",

    "the free energy in the transition region is then given by @xmath28 densities related to other extensive quantities can be computed accordingly .",
    "these ideas are illustrated in fig .",

    "the configurations beyond @xmath32 are unstable . here",
    "not only a phase mixture but also the single ( metastable ) configuration of the opposite phase is energetically favorable .",
    "instability normally arises due to fluctuations , which no longer can be restored by the system .",
    "this is signaled by the violation of a local stability criterion , _",
    "e.g. _ , a negative compressibility . however , our description is based purely on the energetics and can not provide information about the physical mechanism which leads to instability .",
    "this is certainly an indication that the separate description of the two phases breaks down at this point .",

    "fig : pvsrho ] also includes a system with an isospin ratio which corresponds to the second point of equal concentration .",
    "as discussed above , this system also stays at a constant vapor pressure throughout the transition .",
    "the change of the pressure throughout the phase separation in asymmetric systems is an indication of a _ smoother _ transition than in symmetric or one  component systems .",

    ". however , the situation simplifies at extremely high collision energies . in this",
    "so - called scaling regime , the colliding nuclei become transparent and the excited plasma is created between the two nuclei when they recede from the collision point .",
    "the basic assumption here is that the total entropy is created in the initial stage of the collision and remains nearly constant during the later evolution . under this assumption ,",
    "the expansion of the plasma is nearly adiabatic and can be described by relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .    to make contact with this discussion",

    "if we compare the extension of the transition regime in the symmetric and asymmetric systems , we find a similar quantitative difference as observed in the previous discussion",
    ". generally , for a given value of the entropy per baryon , the onset of the transition occurs at a lower density and temperature in asymmetric matter . for example , if we compare the adiabat @xmath138 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : tvsrhos]a ) and ( [ fig : tvsrhos]b ) , the density decreases by @xmath139 and the temperature by @xmath140 mev .",
    "compared to the overall scale set by the critical temperature of @xmath141 mev this temperature difference is certainly less significant .",
    "however , the qualitative difference between the two systems could be an indication that the transition region is experimentally better accessible in a collision of extremely neutron - rich systems , which might be obtainable with radioactive beams .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss how the properties of the phase transition change when the parameter @xmath80 in the hadronic eos is varied .",
    "this point has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for pure neutron matter and here we will extend the analysis to arbitrary isospin ratios .",
    "up to now the hadronic eos in eq .",

    "note that all values of @xmath80 reproduce identical properties of nuclear matter and a transition temperature of @xmath101 mev at zero baryon density .",
    "generally , one observes that for arbitrary isospin ratios , increasing @xmath80 softens the eos , which leads to substantially higher transition densities .",
    "the increase in the symmetric system is remarkable ( note the logarithmic scale ) ; at sufficiently large values of @xmath80 the transition vanishes altogether .",
    "the transition is driven by the energetics in both phases and therefore this behavior is most easily understood by examining the high - density limit of the energy per baryon @xcite .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : omqp ] ) and the relation @xmath144 , one obtains for the quark phase @xmath145 the asymptotic behavior of the hadronic eos depends on @xmath80 and @xmath91 . for @xmath132 , @xmath146 or @xmath106 , @xmath147 the quadratic terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressh ] ) dominate , which leads to @xmath148 thus , at sufficiently high densities , the hadronic matter always has higher energy compared to the quark phase and a transition is possible .",
    "a special situation arises for @xmath106 and @xmath149 . in this case",
    "the leading behavior is , up to the prefactor , identical to eq .",

    "( [ eq : epsq ] ) and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsh2 ] ) , respectively , one arrives at the remarable result that a transition is possible only if ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) @xmath153             > 1+{2\\alpha_s\\over 3\\pi }         \\label{eq : condition } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that for sufficiently large values of the nonlinear coupling , _ symmetric matter remains in the hadron phase_. note that we would arrive at this result for _ arbitrary _ isospin ratios if we included an additional quartic @xmath2 meson coupling . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we conclude that the parameter dependence of the hadronic eos at high densities leads to large uncertainties in the predictions for the transition region of the deconfinement phase transition ( if it exists ) . in principle , reproducing the quantitative features of the transition could be a tool for calibrating the hadronic eos better in the high - density region .",
    "however , more information is required than available at present , and quantitative predictions are limited .",
    "in this paper we studied the deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma as a function of the isospin .",
    "the analysis was based on a separate description of the hadronic and the quark - gluon phase .",
    "we have demonstrated that in a consistent treatment of the two conserved charges , baryon number and isospin , qualitatively new features arise .",
    "most importantly , the phase transition in asymmetric matter is generally continuous and of second - order .",
    "this is in contrast to the discontinuous first - order behavior of symmetric systems , which arise as singular points in the phase diagram of asymmetric matter .",
    "the analysis was based on the determination of the phase separation boundary , the binodal , which indicates the region where a separation into two phases is energetically favorable .",
    "the binodal is determined by gibbs criteria for phase equilibrium . in a system with two conserved charges , it forms a two - dimensional surface in parameter space , in contrast to the one - dimensional surface in one - component systems .",
    "the greater dimensionality leads to the qualitatively new behavior .",
    "primarily , the transition in asymmetric matter is continuous and of second order .",
    "we saw that the pressure , temperature and isospin ratios in the participating phases change throughout the transition .",
    "that means that in general , asymmetric systems pass through a transition region rather than staying at a transition point which leads to discontinuities in one - component and symmetric systems .    to apply these results to the deconfinement phase transition in nuclear matter",
    ", we employed a simple two - phase model .",
    "the hadronic eos was generated in a relativistic mean - field model involving the interaction of baryons with isoscalar scalar and vector fields and with the isovector @xmath2 meson and pion field .",
    "this model involves cubic and quartic isoscalar self - couplings and allows for an accurate calibration at normal nuclear densities to reproduce bulk properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter . for the description of the quark - gluon phase",
    ", we adopted a bag - model type eos involving massless @xmath71 and @xmath72 quarks . in this framework",
    "thermodynamic quantities consists of two parts . a perturbative contribution , where we included the first order correction in the strong coupling constant , and a nonperturbative contribution , represented by the bag constant , which accounts for the qcd trace anomaly .",
    "guided by recent results from lattice calculations , we chose the bag constant and the strong coupling constant to reproduce a transition temperature of 150 mev for matter at zero baryon density .",
    "however , the calibration of the hadronic eos at normal densities is not unique and predictions at high densities are sensitive to the model parameters . by studying variations of the quartic vector meson coupling within the natural range",
    ", we found significant uncertainties in the predictions for the onset of the deconfinement phase transitions in systems at finite baryon density . for sufficiently large values of this coupling",
    "the hadronic eos becomes so soft that the transition vanishes altogether .",
    "this two - phase model was then used to study the deconfinement phase transition in highly excited matter that is produced in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . by construction ,",
    "an approach based on a separate description of the two phases can not reveal the actual nature of the transition .",
    "however , until more concrete and reliable lattice calculations are available , we believe that despite this limitation our analysis is useful for providing a first orientation and concrete description of the qualitative features which arise in the phase diagram of strongly interacting _ asymmetric _ matter .",
    "there are several significant differences between the phase diagram for an asymmetric system and that for symmetric matter . in the first place ,",
    "the location of the transition region in parameter space depends on the isospin ratio of the system .",
    "generally , the onset of phase separation occurs at lower baryon densities and temperatures in more asymmetric systems .",
    "more importantly , the dimensionality of the phase - separation region is larger in asymmetric matter leading to a _ continuous _ transition .",
    "this implies that the thermodynamic properties of the participating phases change throughout the transition .",
    "although these effects are small for realistic isospin ratios @xmath154 , the trend in the isospin dependence to lower densities and temperatures could be an indication that the transition region is easier to reach in collisions of very neutron rich nuclei , which might be created in radioactive beam facilities .",
    "the analysis also revealed interesting physics in the isovector channel .",
    "most importantly , the incorporation of the pions into the model for the hadronic phase was crucial for the shape of the binodal surface and therefore also for the path of the system through the mixed - phase region .",
    "the salient feature is the onset of a pion condensate at large baryon densities and in very asymmetric systems .",
    "this phenomenon is certainly of minor practical importance since the relevant isospin ratios lie beyond the experimentally accessible region .",
    "however , interest in bose condensation has recently been revived in the literature , particularly since the possibility of kaon condensation in neutron star matter has been proposed @xcite . analyzing these effects in connection with the deconfinement phase transition",
