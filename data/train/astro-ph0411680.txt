    "the discovery of the new spectroscopic classes l and t ( nakajima et al . 1995 ; oppenheimer et al . 1995 ; burgasser et al . 2000abc ; kirkpatrick et al . 1999 ) at lower effective temperatures , ( t@xmath4 ) , ( 2200 k@xmath5700 k ) than those encountered in m dwarfs has necessitated the calculation ( and recalculation ) of thermochemical and spectroscopic data for the molecules that predominate in such cool atmospheres . at temperatures ( @xmath6 ) below 2500 k ,",
    "a variety of molecules not dominant in traditional stellar atmospheres become important . though a few molecules , such as tio , vo , co , and h@xmath7o , have been features of m dwarf studies for some time , for the study of l and t dwarfs , even for solar metallicities , the molecules ch@xmath8 , feh , crh , cah , and mgh take on increasingly important roles . the last four metal hydrides are particularly important in subdwarfs , for which the metallicity is significantly sub - solar . in subdwarf",
    "m dwarfs , the spectral signatures of  bimetallic \" species such as tio and vo weaken , while those of the  monometallic \" hydrides , such as feh , cah , crh , and mgh , increase in relative strength .",
    "this shift from metal oxides to metal hydrides in subdwarfs is an old story for m dwarfs , but recently , burgasser et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and burgasser , kirkpatrick & lpine ( 2004 ) have discovered two l dwarf subdwarfs , 2mass j05325346 + 8246465 and 2mass j16262034 + 3925190 , and this shift to hydrides is clear in them as well .",
    "in fact , burgasser , kirkpatrick & lpine ( 2004 ) have recently tentatively identified titanium hydride ( tih ) in 2mass j0532 at @xmath00.94 @xmath1m@xmath2 , a molecule that heretofore had not been seen in  stellar \" atmospheres ( see also burgasser 2004 ) .    in support of l and t dwarf studies",
    ", we have an ongoing project to calculate line lists , line strengths , abundances , and opacities of metal hydrides .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and dulick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have already published new calculations for crh and feh , respectively . with this paper , and in response to the recent detection of tih in 2mass j0532 , we add to this list new spectroscopic , thermochemical , and absorption opacity calculations for tih . in  [ spectwork ] , we summarize the spectroscopic measurements we use to help constrain the spectroscopic constants of tih .",
    "we continue in  [ methods ] with a discussion of the computational chemistry calculations we performed in conjunction with our analysis of the laboratory work on tih . in  [ eos ] , we calculate tih abundances with the newly - derived thermochemical data and partition functions and find that the tih abundances , while not high , are much higher than previous estimates .",
    "we also describe the updates to our general chemical abundance code that are most relevant to titanium chemistry .",
    "section [ opacity ] describes how we use these lists to derive opacities at any temperature and pressure and  [ conclusions ] summarizes our general conclusions concerning these updated tih ro - vibrational constants , abundances , and opacities .",
    "although spectra of tih have been available for several decades ( smith & gaydon 1971 ) , major progress on the spectral assignment has been made only recently @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of tih was first observed by smith and gaydon in 1971 in a shock tube and a tentative @xmath9 assignment was proposed for a band near 530 nm ( smith & gaydon 1971 ) . by comparing the tih measurements ( smith & gaydon 1971 ) with the spectra of @xmath10 ori , @xmath10 sco , and @xmath11 vir , yerle ( 1979 ) proposed that tih was present in stellar photospheres .",
    "yerle s tentative tih assignments in these complex stellar spectra are very dubious .",
    "the first high - resolution investigation of tih was made by steimle et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who observed the laser excitation spectrum of the 530-nm band . after rotational analysis ,",
    "this band was assigned as the @xmath12 sub - band of a @xmath13 transition ( called the @xmath14 transition in the present paper ) .",
    "the spectrum of the 530-nm transition of tih was later investigated by launila and lindgren ( 1996 ) by heating titanium metal in an atmosphere of about 250 torr of hydrogen , and the spectra were recorded using a fourier transform spectrometer .",
    "the assignment of the 530-nm system was confirmed as a @xmath13 transition by the rotational analysis of the four sub - bands of the 0 - 0 vibrational band .",
    "the spectrum of the analogous @xmath13 transition of tid has recently been studied at high resolution using a fourier transform spectrometer @xcite .",
    "tid was also produced by heating titanium powder and 250 torr of d@xmath7 in a king furnace .",
    "the rotational analysis of the @xmath15 and @xmath12 sub - bands produced the first rotational constants for tid @xcite .    in a more recent study",
    ", the spectra of tih and tid were observed in the near infrared @xcite using the fourier transform spectrometer of the national solar observatory at the kitt peak .",
    "the molecules were produced in a titanium hollow cathode lamp by discharging a mixture of ne and h@xmath7 or d@xmath7 gases . a new transition with complex rotational structure",
    "was observed near 938 nm and was assigned as a @xmath16 transition ( called the @xmath17 transition in the present paper ) .",
    "the complexity of this transition is due to the presence of perturbations , as well as overlapping from another unassigned transition @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic constants for the tih and tid states were obtained by rotational analysis of the 0 - 0 band of the four sub - bands .    in other experimental studies of tih ,",
    "a dissociation energy of 48.9@xmath182.1 kcal mole@xmath19 was obtained by chen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using guided ion - beam mass spectrometry .",
    "the fundamental vibrational intervals of 1385.3 cm@xmath19 for tih and 1003.6 cm@xmath19 for tid were measured from matrix infrared absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "the molecules were formed by the reaction of laser - ablated ti atoms with h@xmath7 or d@xmath7 and were isolated in an argon matrix at 10 k.    there have been several previous theoretical investigations of tih . ab initio calculations for tih and other first - row transition metal hydrides have been carried out by walch and bauschlicher ( 1983 ) , chong et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and anglada et al .",
    "spectroscopic properties of the ground states of the first row transition metal hydrides were predicted in these studies .",
    "chong et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and anglada et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have also calculated spectroscopic properties of some low - lying states . in a recent study the spectroscopic properties of the ground and some low - lying electronic states of tih were computed by koseki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) by high level ab initio calculations that included spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the potential energy curves of low - lying states were calculated using both effective core potentials and all - electron approaches .",
    "to supplement the sparse spectroscopic measurements summarized in  [ spectwork ] , we calculate the spectroscopic constants , transition dipole moments , line strengths , and ro - vibrational constants of the tih molecule using standard ab initio quantum chemical techniques .",
    "the orbitals of the tih molecule are optimized using a state - averaged complete - active - space self - consistent - field ( sa - casscf ) approach ( roos , taylor & siegbahn 1980 ) , with symmetry and equivalence restrictions imposed .",
    "our initial choice for the active space include the ti 3d , 4s , and 4p orbitals and the h 1s orbital . in @xmath21 symmetry",
    ", this active space corresponds to four @xmath22 , two @xmath23 , two @xmath24 , and one @xmath25 orbital , which is denoted ( 4221 ) .",
    "test calculations showed that this active space is much too small to study both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 systems simultaneously .",
    "in fact , no practical choice for the active space was found that allowed the study of both band systems simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the two band systems are studied using separate calculations . for the @xmath26 system ,",
    "the ( 4221 ) active space is sufficient . in this series of calculations , two @xmath28 states and one state each of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",
    "are included in the sa procedure , with equal weight given to each state . in the @xmath27 sa - casscf calculations ,",
    "it was necessary to increase the active space , and our final choice is a ( 7222 ) active space that has two additional @xmath32 orbitals and one additional @xmath11 orbital , relative to the ( 4221 ) active space . only the two @xmath30 states are included in the sa - casscf calculations for the @xmath27 system .",
    "more extensive correlation is included using the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction ( ic - mrci ) approach  @xcite .",
    "all configurations from the casscf calculations are used as references in the ic - mrci calculations .",
    "the valence calculations correlate the ti 3d and 4s electrons and the h electron , while in the core+valence calculations the ti 3s and 3p electrons are also correlated .",
    "the ti 3s- and 3p - like orbitals are in the inactive space so they are doubly occupied in all reference configurations .",
    "the effect of higher excitations is accounted for using the multireference analogue of the davidson correction ( + q ) ( langhoff & davidson 1974 ) .",
    "since the ic - mrci calculations are performed in @xmath21 symmetry , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states are in the same symmetry as are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 states .",
    "thus , for the @xmath26 calculation , the ic - mrci reference space included three roots of @xmath37 symmetry and two roots of @xmath38 symmetry .",
    "for the @xmath27 system , the reference space includes four roots of @xmath38 symmetry since there are two @xmath29 states below the @xmath39 state .",
    "scalar relativistic effects are accounted for using the douglas - kroll - hess ( dkh ) approach @xcite .",
    "for ti we use the ( 21s16p9d4f3g1h)/[7s8p6d4f3g1h ] quadruple zeta ( qz ) 3s3p basis set  @xcite , while for h we use the correlation - consistent polarized valence qz set  @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic contraction coefficients are replaced with those from dkh calculations .",
    "all calculations are performed with molpro2002  @xcite that is modified to compute the dkh integrals  [ c.w .",
    "bauschlicher , unpublished ] .",
    "the transition dipole moments for the forbidden @xmath29-@xmath31 and @xmath29-@xmath30 transitions are close to zero . therefore , we conclude that the states are quite pure despite the fact that the ic - mrci calculations are performed in @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "we summarize the computed spectroscopic constants along with available experimental data @xcite in table  [ theory1 ] .",
    "we do not include the ( 2)@xmath28 state from the @xmath40 calculation , since , based on the weight of the reference configurations in ic - mrci calculations , this state is not well described by these calculations .",
    "we first compare the results for the @xmath41 state as a function of treatment . for the treatments that include only valence correlation , @xmath42 and @xmath40 calculations yield very similar results for the @xmath41 state .",
    "when core correlation is included , there is a larger difference between the two sets of calculations . for example , note that the @xmath43 values ( see table [ theory1 ] ) which differ by 6.4  cm@xmath19 at the valence level , differ by 19.7  cm@xmath19 when core correlation is included .",
    "our computed @xmath43 values are significantly larger than the value assigned by chertihin and andrews ( 1994 ) to tih in an ar matrix .",
    "however , recently l. andrews  [ personal communication ] has suggested that their value is incorrect .",
    "the @xmath42 core+valence treatment results in a small increase in the dipole moment , which is now in excellent agreement with experiment , while for the @xmath40 treatment , the inclusion of core correlation leads to a significant decrease in size and a value that is significantly smaller than experiment . using a finite field approach for the @xmath44 state in the @xmath40",
    "core+valence treatment yields a value that is in better agreement with experiment , but is still 0.29  d too small .",
    "the @xmath42 core+valence treatment yields the best agreement with experiment for the value of the ti - h bond distance ( @xmath45 ) of the @xmath44 state , in addition to yielding the best dipole moment .",
    "the core+valence treatment yields a better @xmath45 value for the @xmath39 state , but the disagreement with experiment is larger than for the @xmath44 state .",
    "the valence treatment yields a somewhat better term value ( @xmath46 ) , with both the valence and core+valence values being larger than experiment .",
    "the inclusion of core correlation improves the agreement with experiment for the @xmath45 value for the @xmath47 state and also improves the agreement with the experimental @xmath46 . while the change in most @xmath43 values with the inclusion of core correlation is small , the inclusion of core correlation leads to a sizable reduction in @xmath43 for the @xmath39 state .",
    "we observe a decrease in the dipole moments of the @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath47 states when core correlation is included , as found for the @xmath44 state in the @xmath40 treatment . as for the @xmath44 state , the valence level dipole moment for the @xmath47 state agrees better with experiment .",
    "we suspect that true values for the @xmath29 and @xmath28 states are closer to those obtained in the valence treatment than those obtained in the core+valence treatment .    while the dipole moments vary significantly when core correlation is included , the effect of including core correlation on the dipole transition moment is only up to about 3  percent in the franck - condon region for both transitions of interest . for the @xmath42 transition ,",
    "core correlation increases the moment , while for the @xmath40 transition core correlation decreases the moment .",
    "given the limited experimental data it is difficult to definitively determine the best values for @xmath43 , @xmath48 , and the transition moment .",
    "on the basis of previous calculation on crh @xcite and feh @xcite , we feel that the calculations including the core+valence may yield superior values for all spectroscopic constants excluding the dipole moment , where the smaller active space used in the @xmath40 calculations results in the valence treatment being superior for this property . for the @xmath41 state",
    ", we believe the results obtained using the @xmath42 treatment are superior because it has a larger active space and fewer states in the sa procedure .",
    "we also note that for the @xmath42 treatment , the @xmath44 state dipole moment improves when core correlation is included , which also supports using the @xmath42 treatment for the @xmath44 state . in the end ,",
    "transition dipole moment functions computed at the core+valence level were used to generate the einstein @xmath49 values for the @xmath40 and @xmath42 transitions in table 2 .",
    "the transition moments and ic - mrci+q potentials used to compute the @xmath50 values in table 2 are plotted in figures [ fig : t1 ] and [ fig : t2 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we compare our best values to previous theoretical values .",
    "our best results are in reasonable agreement with those reported by anglada et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ; for the @xmath44 and @xmath50 states their bond distances are 0.07 and 0.02    longer than our best values , respectively , and therefore in slightly worse agreement with experiment .",
    "their @xmath44 state @xmath43 value is about 50  cm@xmath19 smaller than our best value , while their @xmath50 state value is about 140  cm@xmath19 larger than our best value . for the one bond distance for which they report their transition moments",
    ", their @xmath51 transition moment differs from our value by about 10% , while their @xmath52 moment is only very slightly smaller than our value .",
    "the @xmath44 state @xmath53 values reported by koseki et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are about 0.1    longer than our @xmath53 value .",
    "their all electron @xmath43 value is in better agreement with our value than is their value with scalar relativistic effects added .",
    "this is a bit surprising since our calculations include the scalar relativistic effects .",
    "overall the agreement between the different theoretical approaches is relatively good .",
    "our use of much larger basis sets and the inclusion of core - valence correlation results in bond lengths that are in better agreement with experiment , and we assume that the other spectroscopic properties are more accurate in our calculations as well .",
    "a common feature associated with the electronic structure of transition metal hydrides is that the excited electronic states are often heavily perturbed by unobserved neighboring states whereas the ground states are for the most part unperturbed .",
    "the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 states of tih are no exception .",
    "recent work on the analyses of high - resolution fourier transform emission and laser excitation spectra of the @xmath57 ( andersson et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath58 ( steimle et al . 1991 ; launila & lindgren 1996 ) @xmath59 bands have finally yielded rotational assignments for the heavily perturbed @xmath50 and @xmath60 states .    as a prerequisite to calculating opacities for temperatures up to 2000",
    "k , a synthesized spectrum was generated comprised of rovibrational line positions and einstein @xmath50-values for quantum numbers up to @xmath61 and @xmath62 . because the only available experimental data for these states is for @xmath63 , we had to rely heavily on the ab initio calculations described above to supply the missing information on the vibrational structure .",
    "in particular , the first 4 vibrational levels were calculated from the ab initio potentials and fitted with 3 vibrational constants as reported at the end of table 6 .",
    "note that the vibrational constants of table 1 were generated in the same way but with 3 vibrational levels and 2 fitted vibrational constants ( as listed in table 1 ) .",
    "the vibrational constants in tables 1 and 6 are therefore slightly different .",
    "the electronic coupling in the @xmath44 , @xmath50 , and @xmath60 states is intermediate hund s case ( a )  ( b ) over a wide range of @xmath64 .",
    "the case ( a ) hamiltonians for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 states in tables 3 and 4 , respectively , were selected for least - squares fitting of the experimental data . in determining the molecular constants for the @xmath44 state , the reported rotational lines in andersson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were reduced to lower state combination differences , yielding the molecular constants listed in table 5 .",
    "> from these fitted constants , the @xmath44 state term energies were calculated and then used in transforming the observed rotational lines in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath59 bands into term energies for the @xmath50 and @xmath60 states .",
    "molecular constants derived from fits of the @xmath50 and @xmath60 term energies are also listed in table 5 .    except for the @xmath44 state ,",
    "the centrifugal constants @xmath65 and @xmath66 were not statistically determined . instead , these constants were held fixed in the fits of the @xmath50 and @xmath60 states to the values determined by the dunham approximations , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and estimated values for @xmath43 and @xmath69 were supplied by our ab initio calculations ( table 6 ) .",
    "the presence of an anomalously large @xmath70 parity splitting in the @xmath50 state , undoubtedly due to perturbations , required separate fits of the @xmath71- and @xmath72-parity term energies , yielding the two sets of molecular constants in table 5 .",
    "finally , the standard deviations from the fits , 0.031 , 0.28 , 0.16 , and 1.18 cm@xmath19 for the @xmath44 , @xmath50(e ) , @xmath50(f ) , and @xmath60 states , are comparable in quality to 0.026 and 0.42 cm@xmath19 for @xmath44 and @xmath50 ( andersson et al . 2003 ) and 0.020 and 0.573 cm@xmath19 for @xmath44 and @xmath60 ( launila & lingren 1996 ) with roughly the same number of data points and adjustable parameters .    the molecular constants for @xmath73 were generated in a straightforward manner . with the ab initio estimates , @xmath43 , @xmath48 , @xmath74 , @xmath69 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , for each state ( table 6 ) ,",

    "the list of molecular constants in table 6 were then used with the @xmath30 and @xmath31 hamiltonians in computing the term energies from @xmath63 to @xmath88 for @xmath70 rotational levels up to @xmath89 for the @xmath44 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath60 states .",
    "note that all of the vibrational constants have been obtained using ab initio calculations so the location of bands with @xmath92 ( computed using equation ( 3 ) ) is relatively uncertain .    in our calculations",
    "the einstein @xmath50-value is partitioned as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the einstein @xmath50 for the vibronic transition @xmath95 , calculated using the ab initio electronic transition dipole moment function , and hlf is the hnl  london factor . for reference ,",

    "the tih / tio ratio at 10@xmath142 atmospheres and 2500 k is 10@xmath144 and at 10@xmath143 atmospheres and 2500 k it is @xmath010@xmath142 ( one percent ) .",
    "the predominance of @xmath109 before condensation , then its disappearance with condensation , matches the behavior seen in the m to l dwarf transition .",
    "however , the abundance of tio is a more strongly decreasing function of temperature than is that of tih . for a given pressure",
    ", there is a temperature above which the tih / tio ratio actually goes above one . as fig .",
    "[ fig : t3 ] indicates , this transition temperature decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "for 0.01@xmath145 solar metallicity and a pressure of 1 atmosphere , the tih / tio ratio hits unity at only @xmath03500 k and at 10@xmath143 atmospheres it does so near 2500 k. as a result , we expect that tih will assume a more important role in low - metallicity subdwarfs than in  normal \" dwarfs , with metallicities near solar .",
    "this fact is in keeping with the putative measurement of the tih band near 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2([opacity ] ) in the subdwarf 2mass j0532 .    as expected , the abundance of gas - phase species containing titanium drops rapidly when the first titanium - bearing condensates appear , which occurs for solar metallicity at temperatures between 2200 k and 1700 k for pressures of 10@xmath143 and 10@xmath142 atmospheres , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : t3 ] ) . at solar metallicity ,",
    "when titanium - bearing condensates form , the tih abundance is already falling with decreasing temperature ; at condensation its abundance is at least an order of magnitude down from its peak abundance . as fig .",
    "[ fig : t3 ] indicates , the tih abundance is an increasing function of pressure , but assumes a peak , sometimes broad , between the formation of condensates at lower temperatures and the formation of atomic ti / ti@xmath146 at higher temperatures .    the only significant previous study that included tih is that of hauschildt et al .",
    "these authors present numerical data in the form of fractional abundances in the gas phase for a number of titanium - bearing species , including tio and tih , as a function of optical depth .",
    "unfortunately , this makes comparison with our results difficult .",
    "nevertheless , we can still see that for their two solar - metallicity models the maximum ratio of the abundance of tih to tio is smaller than we obtain , sometimes by large factors .",
    "for instance , for their t@xmath147=2700 k model , at an optical depth of unity , their @xmath103 abundance is over four orders of magnitude lower than that of tio , and at an optical depth of 100 , it is still down by three orders of magnitude . for their t@xmath148=4000 k model at unit optical depth , their @xmath103 abundance is below that of tio by three orders of magnitude .",
    "these very low abundances are in contrast to what we obtain at comparable @xmath149 points ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : t3 ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", we find at a temperature of 2700 k , a pressure of 100 atmospheres , and solar metallicity that the abundance of tih is as high as @xmath01.5% of that of tio . at 1 atmosphere , this ratio has dropped by about a factor of 10 , but is still about a factor of 10 larger than the corresponding ratio in hauschildt et al . at a temperature of 4000",
    "k , a pressure of 100 atmospheres , and solar metallicity , we obtain a tih / tio abundance ratio as large as @xmath024% . furthermore ,",
    "as previously mentioned , we find that the tih / tio ratio can go above one and at low metallicities is above one for a wider temperature range .",
    "even at temperatures where this ratio is significantly below one , we conclude that the tih abundance derived with the new thermochemical data is much higher than previously estimated .",
    "using the results of  [ spectwork ] ,  [ methods ] , and  [ dulick ] , we calculate the opacity of the two electronic systems @xmath57 and @xmath58 of @xmath150 . these have band systems centered near 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2 in the near ir and 0.53 @xmath1m@xmath2 in the visible , respectively . for the @xmath51 system ,",
    "4556 vibration - rotation transitions are considered for each of the 20 vibrational bands @xmath151 with @xmath152=0 to 4 and @xmath153=0 to 3 , giving 91120 lines in total . for the @xmath52 system ,",
    "4498 vibration - rotation transitions are incorporated for each of the 24 vibrational bands @xmath152=0 to 3 and @xmath153=0 to 5 , giving 107,952 lines in total .",
    "we use the same methods to calculate the line strengths and broadening as in  5 of dulick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , using the partition function of tih from  [ eos ] . since broadening parameters for tih",
    "are not available , those of @xmath154 are used . in the absence of any other data , since @xmath103 shares many characteristics with feh , this is probably a reasonable assumption .",
    "a truncated lorentzian profile is used , where the absorption in the wings of each line is truncated at min(25@xmath155,100 ) cm@xmath19 on either side of the line center , @xmath156 is the total gas pressure in atmospheres , and the detuning at which the absorption is set to zero does not exceed 100 cm@xmath19 . to conserve the total line strength , the absorption in the part of the profile calculated is increased to account for the truncated wings .",
    "the reason for truncating the profiles is that we have no satisfactory theory to deal with the far wings of molecular lines , but we know that for atomic lines there is a rapid fall - off in the far wings , and , hence surmise that a rapid fall - off is probably realistic .",
    "however , our choice of determining its location is rather arbitrary .    as with feh ,",
    "different isotopic versions are included in the calculations .",
    "the main isotope of @xmath138 is @xmath157 , which makes up 73.8% of terrestrial titanium .",
    "the other isotopes of titanium are @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 with isotopic abundances of 8% , 7.3% , 5.5% , and 5.4% , respectively .",
    "using the same methods as dulick et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on herzberg ( 1950 ) , the shift in the energy levels , and , hence , the transition frequencies for the minor isotopic versions of tih are calculated . as in the case of dulick",
    ", the change in the line strength with isotope depends only on the isotopic fraction of ti in that particular isotopic form , and effects due to changes in the partition function , boltzmann factor , and intrinsic line strength are small , and so are neglected .",

    "the two electronic systems overlap at @xmath00.7 @xmath1m@xmath2 .",

    ", the next strongest peaks at a shorter wavelength and corresponds to the @xmath168 bands ( 1 - 0 , 2 - 1 , 3 - 2 , etc . ) , and the next strongest peaks at a longer wavelength and corresponds to the @xmath169 bands ( 0 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , etc . ) .",
    "there is a similar structure for the @xmath52 system .",
    "many of the peak absorption features of tih occur at about the same wavelengths as the peaks in absorption of @xmath170 , which is more abundant .",
    "this is particularly obvious for the @xmath51 system of @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , although the cross section per molecule of @xmath163 is much less than that of @xmath103 over most of the wavelength region , @xmath163 is far more abundant , and the five peaks corresponding to the @xmath167=-2 , -1 , 0 , 1 and 2 sequence of bands for this @xmath51 system of tih match up approximately with peaks in the @xmath163 absorption spectrum .    therefore , because of the particular wavelength positions of the @xmath109 and @xmath163 absorption bands and the high abundances of the @xmath109 and @xmath163 molecules at solar metallicity , identifying @xmath103 in a solar - metallicity m or l dwarf spectrum , while not impossible , is likely to be difficult .",
    "however , the tih features are not completely obscured , in particular at @xmath00.52 @xmath1m@xmath2 , @xmath00.94 @xmath1m@xmath2 , and weakly in the @xmath3 band near 1.6 @xmath1m@xmath2 .",
    "notice that the band heads of the @xmath51 transition are mainly r - heads because @xmath171 but for the @xmath172 sequence in the @xmath3 band the shading changes and p - heads form .",
    "the peak in the @xmath103 absorption in the @xmath3 band corresponds with a deep trough of the @xmath109 absorption , and is close to a minimum in the @xmath163 absorption .",
    "therefore , in particular in subdwarfs with sub - solar metallicities , for which the abundances of metal hydrides come into their own vis  vis metal oxides ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t3 ] ) , spectral features of tih in the @xmath3 band and at 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2should emerge .",
    "the larger tih abundances we derive in  [ eos ] also suggest this .",
    "the recent detection in the subdwarf l dwarf 2mass j0532 by burgasser , kirkpatrick & lpine ( 2004 ) of the tih feature at 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2is in keeping with these expectations .",
    "for the tih molecule , we have combined ab initio calculations with spectroscopic measurements to derive new thermochemical data , new spectral line lists and oscillator strengths , its abundance ( for a given composition , temperature , and pressure ) , and its per - molecule absorption opacities .",
    "we find that with the new partition functions , the abundance of tih in m and l dwarf atmospheres is much higher than previously thought , that the tih / tio ratio increases strongly with decreasing metallicity , and that at high enough temperatures the tih / tio ratio can exceed unity .",
    "furthermore , we conclude that , particularly for subdwarf l and m dwarfs , spectral features of tih near 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2and in the @xmath3 band may not be weak",
    ". the recent putative detection of the 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2feature in the l subdwarf 2mass j0532 is encouraging in this regard and suggests that the detection of tih in other dwarfs may shed light on their atmospheric titanium chemistry .",

    "<S> using previous measurements and quantum chemical calculations to derive the molecular properties of the tih molecule , we obtain new values for its ro - vibrational constants , thermochemical data , spectral line lists , line strengths , and absorption opacities . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we calculate the abundance of tih in m and l dwarf atmospheres and conclude that it is much higher than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the tih / tio ratio increases strongly with decreasing metallicity , and at high temperatures can exceed unity . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that , particularly for subdwarf l and m dwarfs , spectral features of tih near @xmath00.52 @xmath1m@xmath2 , 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2 , and in the @xmath3 band may be more easily measurable than heretofore thought . </S>",
    "<S> the recent possible identification in the l subdwarf 2mass j0532 of the 0.94 @xmath1m@xmath2feature of tih is in keeping with this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that looking for tih in other dwarfs and subdwarfs will shed light on the distinctive titanium chemistry of the atmospheres of substellar - mass objects and the dimmest stars . </S>"
