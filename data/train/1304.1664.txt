    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are interacting binaries where a low - mass donor transfers matter onto the neutron star or black hole via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "this process forms an accretion disk and gives rise to the observed x - rays , making them among the brightest x - ray sources in the sky ( see e.g. the collected reviews in lewin & van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "although optical counterparts for many of the bright lmxbs have been known for a long time , kinematic studies of these systems are often not straightforward .",
    "this is mainly due to reprocessing of the x - rays in the outer accretion disk that completely dominates the optical light .",
    "this situation has changed only with the advent of sensitive spectrographs on very large telescopes .    using phase - resolved medium resolution spectroscopy of scox-1 ,",
    "steeghs & casares ( 2002 ) detected the presence of narrow high excitation lines that were strongest in the bowen region ( a blend of niii @xmath44634/4640 and ciii @xmath44647/4650 ) .",
    "these narrow lines originate from the irradiated surface of the donor star and allowed for the first time a radial velocity study of both binary components in scox-1 which led to constrain its mass function .",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopic studies of about a dozen other bright lmxbs have revealed the presence of these narrow components in the bowen region in most lmxbs and provided in many cases the first constraints on the mass of their compact objects ( e.g. cornelisse et  al .",
    "2008 for an overview ) .",
    "one such bright lmxb is serpensx-1 ( serx-1 ) .",
    "it was discovered in the 1960s ( friedman et  al .",
    "1967 ) , but its optical counterpart ( mmser ) was only identified about 10 years later ( davidsen 1975 ) .",
    "further observations taken in good seeing conditions showed that the optical counterpart consisted of a blend of two stars that are separated by @xmath02.1 arcsec ( thorstensen et  al .",
    "subsequently , one of these was itself revealed to be a blend of two stars that are only separated by 1 arcsec ( wachter 1997 ) . both spectroscopy ( hynes et  al .",
    "2004 ) and radio observations ( migliari et  al . 2004 ) confirmed that the bluer of the stars is the true optical counterpart . due to the well - established presence of thermonuclear x - ray bursts from serx-1",
    ", the compact object is known to be a neutron star ( li & lewin 1976 ) .",
    "furthermore , serx-1 was one of the first neutron star lmxbs in which a broad relativistic iron line was detected , and modeling of this line inferred an inclination of @xmath525@xmath3 ( bhattacharyya & strohmayer 2007 ; ng et  al .",
    "however , despite over 40 years of study little else is known about serx-1 .",
    "here we present the results of a spectroscopic study of serx-1 using the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma ( spain ) .",
    "we detect a @xmath02 hr periodic variation that we interpret as the orbital period .",
    "although the emission lines are very narrow and sharp ( as was already reported by hynes et  al .",
    "2004 ) , we present further evidence that this is due to the low inclination of the system instead of the lines being formed on the irradiated surface of the donor star or the stream - impact point .",
    "on 6 july 2011 we observed serx-1 for 4 hrs continuously ( ut 21:45 - 02:23 ) using osiris on gtc . for each exposure we used the volume - phased holographic grism r1200v with a slit width of 1.0 arcsec , resulting in a total of 24 spectra with an exposure time of 600 seconds each .",
    "the seeing during the observations varied between 0.7 and 1.0 arc - seconds . since serx-1 is @xmath01 arcsec from a fainter field star , we aligned the slit in such a way that we minimized the contribution of this interloper .",
    "however , this does mean that no comparison star is included in the slit and we could therefore not correct for slit losses .",
    "arc lamp exposures were taken for wavelength calibration during the daytime .",
    "for the data reduction ( i.e. debias , flatfielding etc ) we used the pamela software that allows for optimal extraction of the spectra ( horne 1986 ) .",
    "we determined the pixel - to - wavelength scale using a 4th order polynomial fit to 20 lines resulting in a dispersion of 0.79 pixel@xmath6 , an rms scatter of @xmath50.05  , and a wavelength coverage of @xmath4@xmath44434 - 6060 .",
    "the final resolution around the heii @xmath44686 emission line is 107.6 km s@xmath6 ( fwhm ) .",
    "finally we also corrected for any velocity shifts due to instrument flexure ( always @xmath56 km s@xmath6 ) by cross - correlating the sky spectra . for the corresponding analysis of the resulting dataset we used the molly package",
    "first we created an average normalized spectrum of serx-1 , and show the result in fig.[spect ] .",
    "the spectrum is very similar to that presented by hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but there are also a few differences . to start with the similarities , the most prominent emission lines that are commonly detected in lmxbs are also present in our spectrum ( and indicated in fig.[spect ] ) , and all of them are extremely narrow as shown in table[stats ] .",
    "in particular a close - up of the bowen region , presented in fig.[bowen ] , suggests that the individual niii components ( i.e. 4634 and 4640 ) are clearly separated , while there is also no hint of any ciii lines .",
    "furthermore , we detect hei @xmath44471 in absorption , and there are hints of features at the location of other hei transitions in our spectrum ( which are indicated in fig.[spect ] ) .",
    "however , since hei @xmath44471 is on the edge of the wavelength coverage where the sensitivity starts to drop significantly , it is not possible to conclude anything else from this line .",
    "finally , just like hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) we also detect the broad absorption trough just redward of h@xmath7 and the unidentified emission features at 4604 and 4945  .",
    "this confirms beyond doubt that they are not artefacts and must be true features of the system , and we have indicated them with a `` ? '' in fig.[spect ] .",
    "the two main differences between our spectrum and that of hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) are a much more complex structure around h@xmath7 and several new features ( which we have also indicated with a `` ? '' ) .",
    "the detailed structure around h@xmath7 ( ranging from 4800 - 4950  ) appears to form an inverted p cygni profile , as if it were a single feature .",
    "however , within the current framework of lmxbs it is difficult to understand how a significant infall component above the disk of serx-1 at velocities well over 4000 km s@xmath6 ( which are needed to produce such a profile ) could occur .",
    "furthermore , from the hei @xmath44471 absorption line we already know that at least hei @xmath44922 will be present in absorption and contributing to this feature .",
    "we therefore think it more likely that the full complex around h@xmath7 is made up of many blended emission and absorption lines .    of the new features that are present in our spectrum , the broad emission components just redward of heii @xmath45411 and the narrow one around 5004  , are particularly interesting .",
    "they should have been clearly detected by hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and to our knowledge have no counterpart in any other lmxb .",
    "to identify the narrow features at 4605 and 5004  , we used the atomic line list by van hoof & verner ( 1998 ) and the applied off - set of 92 km s@xmath6 ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) from the heii @xmath44686 rest - frame wavelength as an estimate of the systemic velocity of serx-1 . the 4605  feature corresponds to a niii transition ( 4603.8  ) , while that at 5004  is close to a nii one ( 5002.7  ) .",
    "we therefore tentatively conclude that these unknown transitions are due to ionised nitrogen .",
    "we examined the broad feature at 5440 in the individual spectra by eye and note that it is extremely variable .",
    "although present in all spectra , its strength and width shows large changes from spectrum to spectrum .",
    "we illustrate this in fig.[variable ] by showing the close - up of this region in two different spectra .",
    "although we have no explanation for the strong variability displayed , the profile in the lower spectrum in fig.[variable ] does suggest that it consists of several unresolved lines .",
    "indeed we note that a large number of nii / niii transitions occur in this region that are close to the individual peaks displayed , but the quality and resolution of the individual spectra does not allow us to unambiguously conclude this .      following the report of hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) of a small drift of heii @xmath44686 over the period of @xmath0an hour , we inspected the trail of this line by eye .",
    "we could clearly see some movement over time and therefore averaged two consecutive spectra together to improve the signal - to - noise , thereby creating 12 spectra in total . for each of these spectra",
    "we then determined the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , equivalent width ( ew ) and radial velocity .",
    "our fwhm measurements show that the line is resolved and we therefore corrected our measurements for instrumental broadening using a nearby line in our arc spectrum . since both the fwhm and ew do not change significantly during our observations we present their average value in table[stats ] .",
    "finally , we note that the average radial velocity is consistent with that observed by hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and in fig.[rv ] we show the resulting radial velocity curve .",

    "we therefore checked other strong emission lines ( i.e. the bowen region and heii @xmath45411 ) to see if similar variability is present .",
    "the bowen region also shows that there are no strong changes between the spectra in both strength and width of the individual components that make up the blend .",
    "we also note that there are clear velocity shifts in niii @xmath44640 , the strongest component of the bowen region , and therefore measured the fwhm , ew and radial velocity for this line .",
    "we present the results in fig.[rv ] and table[stats ] .",
    "finally we also measured the average ew and fwhm of the full bowen blend , and list these results in table[stats ] .",
    "as already pointed out in sect.3.1 , the region around heii @xmath45411 is more complex due to the strongly variable component just redward ( see fig.[variable ] ) .",
    "however , heii is itself clearly visible in the individual spectra and again it is moving , and in fig[rv ] we give its radial velocity curve .",
    "however , the fwhm and in particular ew measurements of the individual spectra gives such a large spread ( see fig.[variable ] ) that we have opted to only measure these values from the average of all spectra , giving the results in table[stats ] .",
    "finally we also measured the fwhm and ew of the full complex between 5400 - 5450  , and these are also included in table[stats ] .",
    "we also searched for variability in the unidentified emission lines in fig.[spect ] ( those indicated with `` ? '' ) .",
    "most lines are either too weak or show no variability , and we therefore only present their fwhm and ew in table[stats ] .",
    "the emission line at 5004   is the only one that shows some evidence of variability although at a low significance of @xmath02@xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , a sine - wave fit to its radial velocity curve gives a period and amplitude that are consistent with the lines discussed above .",
    "for completeness we list the fit results in table[stats ] , but will not include them in any further analysis .",
    "fig[rv ] shows that the three emission lines all have a variability with a period , semi - amplitude and phasing that are similar within the errors . to verify that the variability does not have an instrumental origin we also measured the radial velocities of a diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) around 5780 ",
    "this is included as the bottom panel of fig[rv ] , and shows clearly no velocity shifts in the dib feature to a limit of @xmath59.4 km s@xmath6 ( 99% confidence ) .",
    "finally , for the heii@xmath44686 radial velocity curve a @xmath15@xmath12-test indicates that the variability is highly significant , since fitting it to a constant velocity gives @xmath16=5.7 ( for 11 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the variability in the 3 emission lines is real , and fitted the radial velocity curve for each emission line with a sine wave ( resulting in @xmath16=0.85 for heii @xmath44686 ) .",
    "we list the resulting periods and semi - amplitudes in table[stats ] , and note that apart from the systemic velocity , @xmath17 , all parameters are similar within the errors .",
    "the differences in @xmath17 are most likely due to the fact that both niii @xmath44640 and heii @xmath45411 are blended with nearby lines , thereby producing an off - set .",
    "this is further strengthened by the fact that their fwhm is much broader than heii @xmath44686 .",
    "since we do not expect heii @xmath44686 to be blended we think that this line provides the best estimate of the systemic velocity , which we measure as @xmath17=92@xmath104 km s@xmath6 .    finally , we phase - folded both the bowen blend and heii @xmath44686 in 8 bins to check for other emission features moving around on a similar period ( but at a different phase and semi - amplitude ) .",
    "a visual inspection does not show any other moving component .",
    "furthermore , we created averages by co - adding spectra spanning 0.25 orbital cycles around the expected minimum and maximum of both niii @xmath44640 and heii @xmath44686 . at both",
    "extrema the lines can be very well described by a single gaussian and the addition of a second gaussian ( either as a broader underlying feature or a second narrow peak ) does not significantly improve the fit ( according to an @xmath18-test ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the emission lines can be represented by a single component .",
    "we have presented evidence for a @xmath02 hrs periodic radial velocity variation in the emission lines from serx-1 from our gtc observations .",
    "although this variation is based only on approximately 2 cycles worth of data , and therefore still needs confirmation , we tentatively conclude that we have detected the orbital period of serx-1 .",
    "for the rest of the discussion we will assume that the variability is truly due to orbital motion and consider what the implications are for the properties of this system .",
    "another important observation is the fact that most emission lines are narrow and are best described by a single component .",
    "this strongly suggests that they are located in a single region somewhere in the binary .",
    "hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) have already listed several potential locations : the outer accretion disk , the irradiated surface of the donor star or the stream - impact point . based on our proposed orbital period",
    ", we can now explore these different suggestions to find out what the consequences for the system parameters of serx-1 will be .",
    "could the emission lines arise from the irradiated surface of the donor star ?",
    "narrow components arising from the irradiated donor star surface have been observed in many persistent lmxbs ( see e.g. cornelisse et  al .",
    "2008 for an overview ) .",
    "these narrow components are in general strongest in the bowen region , but there are also examples ( e.g. exo0748@xmath19676 ) where the heii lines show a large component arising from the irradiated surface ( muoz - darias et  al .",
    "although the narrow components in many lmxbs have a fwhm comparable to that observed for serx-1 , their radial velocity semi - amplitudes are typically an order of magnitude larger ( e.g. casares et  al .",
    "2006 , cornelisse et  al .",
    "2007 , barnes et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "if the lines arise from the irradiated surface of the donor star , then the observed fwhm of the emission lines of @xmath0180 km s@xmath6 must be due to rotational broadening only ( since there is no evidence that the lines consist of multiple components ) . in this case",
    "we can easily show that for any reasonable mass ratio of serx-1 , the fwhm is incompatible with the observed radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath20=38 km s@xmath6 .    as a first order estimate to interpret our measurements ,",
    "we must assume a large mass ratio and that the accretion disk in serx-1 is not shadowing the donor star , i.e. @xmath20 is tracing emission coming from l1 .",
    "this will lead to the largest so - called @xmath9-correction in order to derive the true radial velocity semi - amplitude of the donor star . using the @xmath9-correction polynomials by muoz - darias et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) for @xmath21=0.8 ( the largest mass ratio for which their @xmath9-correction is still valid to 1% ) gives a radial velocity semi - amplitude of the donor star of @xmath22=111 km s@xmath6 . from this value of @xmath22 , together with @xmath21=0.8",
    "we can estimate a rotational broadening of the emission lines of @xmath23sin@xmath24= 0.462@xmath25@xmath26(1+@xmath21)@xmath27=70 km s@xmath6 ( wade & horne 1988 ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the 180 km s@xmath6 we observe , and suggests that @xmath21@xmath280.8 . even for the highly unlikely assumption of @xmath21@xmath01.0 these numbers will still not work , and we can not obtain a sensible solution , and we therefore reject the suggestion that the lines arise from the donor star .    if we instead assume that the emission lines are produced in the accretion disk ( or the stream - impact region ) we find that it is possible to create a consistent set of system parameters . as an x - ray burster ,",
    "the compact object is a neutron star , whose mass we will assume is close to the canonical value of 1.4@xmath1 . furthermore , from our proposed short orbital period we can also infer that the donor star , if it is a main sequence star , must be of a late spectral type such as a m5v dwarf ( which has a mass of 0.14@xmath1 ) . under these assumptions",
    "we can use kepler s law to calculate that the binary radius is @xmath29=0.9@xmath30 .",
    "furthermore the donor s roche lobe would then be 0.2@xmath30 ( paczynski 1971 ) , i.e. comparable to the radius of such a late type star .",
    "interestingly , de jong et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) derived a mean disk opening angle for lmxbs of @xmath012@xmath31 , making it possible that the disk in serx-1 is indeed flared sufficiently to shield the donor star completely from irradiation .",
    "this could explain the absence of any indication of emission from the irradiated donor star in serx-1 .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of ionised nitrogen , combined with the absence of carbon suggest a more massive donor star .",
    "serx-1 does not show any hint of the typically observed ciii @xmath44647/4650 in its spectrum ( see e.g. steeghs & casares 2002 ) , while the curious emission features in fig.[spect ] ( those labelled with `` ? '' ) could all be nitrogen transitions .",
    "this strange abundance could be due to the cno fusion reaction cycle ( e.g. shen & bildsten 2007 ) , where proton capture on @xmath32n is the slowest step .",
    "since the cno cycle is only dominant in stars more massive than our sun , this would imply that the donor in serx-1 was originally much more massive and that the processed material was mixed to the surface by convection .",
    "however , we know from hynes et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) that h@xmath33 has a similar strength as is typically observed in lmxbs ( note that from our fig.[spect ] it is not even clear if h@xmath7 is detected ) , suggesting that the outer layers of the donor in serx-1 have not been stripped .",
    "it is therefore unclear if the spectrum of serx-1 can account for an evolved low mass donor .    despite the caveat mentioned above we",
    "can still consider whether the emission is coming from the full outer accretion disk or a localized spot in the disk such as the stream - impact region using a low mass donor .",
    "in the first case the observed radial velocity curve should trace the motion of the compact object , while in the second case it would be that of the keplerian orbit of the impact region . in both scenarios",
    "we need an estimate of the size of the accretion disk , and we assume that it reaches at least the truncation radius ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "using the system parameters described above we estimate that @xmath35=0.60@xmath29/(1+@xmath21)=0.45@xmath30 ( frank et  al .",
    "2002 ) . assuming a keplerian accretion disk , the velocity at the edge of the disk",
    "would then be @xmath0770 km s@xmath6 . if the line emission arises in the stream - impact region , which we expect to be close to the edge of the disk , an inclination of @xmath24@xmath03@xmath3",
    "is needed to explain the observed 38 km s@xmath6 semi - amplitude .",
    "furthermore , this inclination would also imply a non - projected fwhm of @xmath03650 km s@xmath6 . since these numbers ,",
    "in particular the true fwhm , are rather extreme we think this unlikely .    for the case of disk emission on the other hand , we can estimate an inclination of the system of @xmath24@xmath09@xmath3 using the mass function ( @xmath36(@xmath37)=@xmath37sin@xmath38/(1+@xmath21)@xmath12=@xmath39@xmath8/2@xmath40@xmath41 ) .",
    "this suggests that the emission lines would have a non - projected fwhm of @xmath01150 km s@xmath6 , which is compatible to the fwhms observed in high - inclination lmxbs such as x1822@xmath19371 or grmus ( casares et  al .",
    "2003 ; barnes et  al . 2007 ) . furthermore , if serx-1 is observed at such low inclination the spectral resolution of our dataset would not allow us to resolve the double - peaked structure that is typical for emission lines that are formed in the accretion disk ( and have typical peak separations of @xmath0600 km s@xmath6 ) , and the emission lines become indistinguishable from a single gaussian .",
    "obviously , more complicated system geometries can be envisaged .",
    "one such complication , which is most likely important in serx-1 , is the presence of strong tidal forces .",
    "for example whitehurst ( 1988 ) showed that the accretion disk becomes tidally unstable and asymmetric for systems with an extreme mass - ratio ( i.e. @xmath21@xmath20.3 ) .",
    "since this is most likely the case in serx-1 the accretion disk will not be a simple keplerian one as we have assumed here .",
    "however , we do not think that this will affect our main conclusion , namely that we have discovered a @xmath02 hr periodic variability that we tentatively identify as the orbital period .",
    "if true , serx-1 is a low inclination system with the spectral lines dominated by emission from the accretion disk .",

    "<S> spectroscopy of the low mass x - ray binary serx-1 using the gran telescopio canarias have revealed a @xmath02 hr periodic variability that is present in the three strongest emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively interpret this variability as due to orbital motion , making it the first indication of the orbital period of serx-1 . </S>",
    "<S> together with the fact that the emission lines are remarkably narrow , but still resolved , we show that a main sequence k - dwarf together with a canonical 1.4@xmath1 neutron star gives a good description of the system . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the most likely place for the emission lines to arise is the accretion disk , instead of a localized region in the binary ( such as the irradiated surface or the stream - impact point ) , and their narrowness is due instead to the low inclination ( @xmath210@xmath3 ) of serx-1 .    </S>",
