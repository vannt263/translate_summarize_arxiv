    "despite of all nice results of general relativity ( gr ) , the study of possible modifications of einstein s theory of gravity has a long history which reaches back to the early 1920s @xcite .",
    "while the proposed early amendments of einstein s theory were aimed toward the unification of gravity with the other interactions of physics , the recent interest in such modifications comes from cosmological observations ( for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the presence of the big bang singularity , the flatness and horizon problems @xcite led to the statement that cosmological standard model , based on gr and standard model of particle physics , is inadequate to describe the universe at extreme regimes . besides from quantun field theory point view",
    ", gr is a _ classical _ theory which does not work as a fundamental theory , when one wants to achieve a full quantum description of spacetime ( and then of gravity ) .",
    "the astrophysical and cosmological observations usually lead to the introduction of additional _ ad - hoc _ concepts like dark energy / matter if interpreted within einstein s theory .",
    "in fact the principal physical aspects are the cosmic acceleration and the flat galactic rotation curves",
    ". these aspects could be interpreted as a first signal of a breakdown of gr at astrophysical and cosmological scales @xcite and led to the proposal of several alternative modifications of the underlying gravity theory ( see @xcite for the review ) .    while it is very natural ( from the theoretical point of view ) to extend einstein s gravity to theories with additional geometric degrees of freedom ,",
    "( see for example @xcite for general surveys on this subject as well as @xcite for a list of works in a cosmological context ) , recent attempts focused on the old idea of modifying the gravitational lagrangian in a purely metric framework , leading to higher order field equations .",
    "as such an approach is the so - called extended theories of gravity ( etg ) which have become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction .",
    "they are based on corrections and enlargements of the einstein theory .",
    "the paradigm consists , essentially , in adding higher order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics which come out from the effective action of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "a sub class of etg are the fourth order gravities ( fog ) where we do not consider further scalar fields but only the curvature invariants .    the motivation to modify the gr come from the issue of a full recovering of the mach principle which leads to assume a varying gravitational coupling .",
    "the principle states that the local inertial frame is determined by some average of the motion of distant astronomical objects @xcite .",
    "this fact implies that the gravitational coupling can be scale - dependent and related to some scalar field . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of `` inertia '' and the equivalence principle have to be revised .",
    "for example , the brans - dicke theory @xcite is a serious attempt to define an alternative theory to the einstein gravity : it takes into account a variable newton gravitational coupling , whose dynamics is governed by a scalar field non - minimally coupled to the geometry .",
    "in such a way , mach s principle is better implemented @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , corrections to the gravitational lagrangian were already studied by several authors @xcite soon after the gr was proposed .",
    "developments in the 1960s and 1970s @xcite , partially motivated by the quantization schemes proposed at that time , made clear that theories containing _ only _ a ricci scalar square term in the lagrangian were not viable with respect to their weak field behavior .",
    "another concern which comes with generic _ higher order gravity _ ( hog ) theories is linked to the initial value problem .",
    "it is unclear if the prolongation of standard methods can be used in order to tackle this problem in every theory .",
    "hence it is doubtful that the cauchy problem could be properly addressed in the near future , for example within the theories with inverse of ricci scalar , if one takes into account the results already obtained in fourth order theories stemming from a quadratic lagrangian @xcite .",
    "besides , every unification scheme as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , takes into account effective actions where non - minimal couplings to the geometry or higher order terms in the curvature invariants are present .",
    "such contributions are due to one - loop or higher loop corrections in the high curvature regimes near the full ( not yet available ) quantum gravity regime @xcite .",
    "specifically , this scheme was adopted in order to deal with the quantization on curved spacetimes and the result was that the interactions among quantum scalar fields and background geometry or the gravitational self - interactions yield corrective terms in the hilbert - einstein lagrangian @xcite .    from a conceptual viewpoint ,",
    "there are no _ a priori _ reasons to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to the linear function of the ricci scalar , minimally coupled with matter @xcite .",
    "since all curvature invariants are at least second order differential , the corrective terms in the field equations will be always at least fourth order . that is why generally we call them higher order terms ( with respect to the terms of gr ) .",
    "the idea to extend einstein s theory of gravitation is fruitful and economic also with respect to several attempts which try to solve problems by adding new and , most of times , unjustified ingredients in order to give a self - consistent picture of dynamics .",
    "the today observed accelerated expansion of the hubble flow and the missing matter of astrophysical large scale structures , are primarily enclosed in these considerations .",
    "both the issues could be solved changing the gravitational sector , _",
    "i.e. _ the _ l.h.s .",
    "_ of field equations .",
    "the philosophy is alternative to add new cosmic fluids ( new components in the _ r.h.s . _ of field equations ) which should give rise to clustered structures ( dark matter ) or to accelerated dynamics ( dark energy ) thanks to exotic equations of state .",
    "in particular , relaxing the hypothesis that gravitational lagrangian has to be a linear function of the ricci curvature scalar , like in the hilbert - einstein formulation , one can take into account an effective action where the gravitational lagrangian includes other scalar invariants .",
    "in summary , the general features of etgs are that the einstein field equations result to be modified in two senses : @xmath4 geometry can be non - minimally coupled to some scalar field , and / or @xmath5 higher than second order derivative terms in the metric come out . in the former case",
    ", we generically deal with scalar - tensor theories of gravity ; in the latter , we deal with higher order theories",
    ". however combinations of non - minimally coupled and higher - order terms can emerge as contributions in effective lagrangians . in this case , we deal with higher - order - scalar - tensor theories of gravity .    due to the increased complexity of the field equations in this framework , the main amount of works dealt with some formally equivalent theories , in which a reduction of the order of the field equations was achieved by considering the metric and the connection as independent fields @xcite . in addition",
    ", many authors exploited the formal relationship to scalar - tensor theories to make some statements about the weak field regime , which was already worked out for scalar - tensor theories more than ten years ago @xcite .",
    "moreover other authors exploited a systematic analysis of such theories were performed at short scale and in the low energy limit @xcite . in particular",
    "the fog has been studied in the so - called newtonian limit ( case of weak field and small velocity ) and in the weak field limit ( case of gravitational waves ) @xcite . in the first case we found a modification of gravitational potential , while in the second one the massive propagation of waves .",
    "after these preliminary studies it needs to check the new theories by applying them in the realistic model .",
    "then the galactic rotation curve @xcite or the motion of body in the solar system have been evaluated .",
    "it is worth remembering that one of the first experimental confirmations of einsteinian theory of gravity was the deflection of light .",
    "since then , gravitational lensing ( gl ) has become one of the most useful successes of gr and it represents nowadays a powerful tool @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the equation for the photon deflection considering the newtonian limit of a general class of @xmath6-gravity where @xmath2 is a unspecific function of @xmath7 ( ricci scalar ) , @xmath8 ( ricci tensor square ) and @xmath9 ( rieman tensor square ) .",

    "ii we introduce the @xmath6-gravity and its field equations resuming shortly the newtonian limit approach , while the section iii - a is devoted to study of photon traveling embedded in a gravitational field . in this section",
