    "it is widely accepted that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ( lynden - bell 1969 ) . the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) or its variants that account for the so - called `` big blue bump '' ( shields 1978 ; malkan 1983 ; laor & netzer 1989 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; brunner et al .",
    "1997 ; brocksopp et al . 2006 ; l 2008 ) show that a typical accretion rate is a fraction of the eddington limit . over the last four decades",
    ", much attention has been paid to the radiation process and dynamics of the accretion disk , but far less is known about the mechanism driving such an accretion rate .",
    "there is little understanding of how the smbhs are fed at the @xmath1 pc scale , or about the outer boundary condition of the shakura - sunyaev accretion disk .",
    "two important clues can help resolve these wide - open issues .",
    "the first is the role of the vertical self - gravity of the outer part of the accretion disk .",
    "paczynski ( 1978 ) pointed out that quasar accretion disks are so massive that self - gravity dominates .",
    "as a consequence , the disk unavoidably collapses into clumps , among which collisions provide a natural mechanism for viscosity .",
    "this was recently stressed again by rafikov ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , kolykhalov & sunyaev ( 1980 ) suggested that star formation can not be avoided in such a massive disk . since this pioneering work",
    ", many attempts have been made to construct models that incorporate star formation in the disk as well as take account of its roles in the viscosity and related issues ( sakimoto & coroniti 1981 ; lin & pringle 1987 ; shlosman & begelman 1987 ; shlosman et al .",
    "1989 ; shlosman & begelman 1989 ; gammie 2001 ; goodman 2003 ; collin & zahn 1999 , 2008 ; thompson et al . 2005",
    "; tan & blackmann 2005 ; nayakshin & sunyaev 2005 ; nayakshin et al . 2008 ; and the recent numerical simulations of hobbs et al . 2011",
    "; jiang & goodman 2011 ) .",
    "all of these studies reach a similar conclusion : star formation in the dense accretion disk is so efficient that the remaining gas can not adequately feed the smbhs unless there is an external torque to transport angular momentum ( e.g. thompson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the second major clue is the high metal abundances observed in quasar broad - line regions ( blrs ) , showing that there is a fast process of metal enrichment in the nuclear regions of agns unless the enrichment has been done before reaching the nuclear regions ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; see a review of hamann & ferland 1999 ; collin 1999 ) .",
    "generally , the metallicity of host galaxies is significantly lower than that of the blr , with even the circumnuclear regions of galaxies having only slightly more than solar metallicity ( dors et al .",
    "the blr metallicity correlates with smbh mass or agn luminosity ( hamann & ferland 1999 ; warner et al .",
    "2003 ; matsuoka et al .",
    "recently , simon & hamann ( 2010 ) found that the blr metallicity does not correlate with star formation rates of host galaxies as traced by far - infrared emission .",
    "these observational indications provide evidence for intense star formation in a massive disk associated with the central engine rather than that the blr metals are transported from the host galaxies .",
    "however , the problem remains that smbhs must be fed with a sufficiently high mass rate to produce the observed luminosity .",
    "it has seemed irreconcilable for agn to simultaneously have _ both _ high metallicity and large accretion rates .",
    "a solution to this puzzle is to employ turbulence excited by supernovae explosions ( snexp ) of massive stars during star formation as a means to transport angular momentum ( chen et al .",
    "2009 ; wang et al .",
    "2010 ; hobbs et al .",
    "recently , wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) stressed the roles of star formation in metal production in the inflows developed from the inner edge of the dusty torus , driving not only a sub - eddington - limit accretion rate of the smbhs , but also the formation of a compact nuclear star cluster after multiple agn episodes .",
    "they find that snexp have two main effects in the sf disk : 1 ) they deliver gas inward , reducing local star formation rates ; and 2 ) the top - heavy initial mass function quickly feeds processed gas back into the gaseous disk , enhancing the metallicity . the gas supply to the smbhs is thus maintained with a rate typical of quasars , while at the same time the metal - rich properties such as the metallicity - luminosity trend can be quantitatively explained ( wang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the blr metallicity measured from the / ratio ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) directly reflects the metallicity in the sf disk as long as the blr continues to be fed from the sf disk .",
    "quantitative predictions of the properties of the sf disk and the way in which it feeds the blr are urgently needed so that observational tests can be made in the future .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    " 2 gives the model of sf disk in light of toomre s parameter and justifications for it .",
    " 3 is devoted to building a metallicity equation for the sf disk that can predict its metallicity gradient and evolution . ",
    "4 focuses on the development of thermal diffusion of hot gas from the sf disk .",
    "we show that the diffusion rate can reach as high as a few @xmath2 in quasars .",
    "observational consequences are then discussed in  5 .",
    "conclusions and some further brief discussion are given in the last section .",
    "we start by summarizing the results published to date about star forming disks .",
    "most of the release of gravitational energy around an smbh occurs in a region within about @xmath3 of the black hole , where @xmath4 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath5 is the gravity constant , @xmath6 is the smbh mass and @xmath7 is the light speed .",
    "this part of the accretion disk is understood much better than its outskirts . to minimize the uncertainties due to the opacity etc . , we start with the shakura - sunyaev disk for the self - gravity radius given by equation ( 18 ) in laor & netzer ( 1989 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the radiative efficiency , assuming toomre s parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this is very similar to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the rossland opacity , @xmath17 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath18 is the eddington ratio and @xmath19 is the bolometric luminosity ( collin & hur 1999 ) . beyond this radius ,",
    "the disk is unstable to self - gravity , inducing star formation . in the self - gravitating regions , the radiation from star formation",
    "is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the star formation rate and @xmath22 is the efficiency of converting mass into radiation through star formation .",
    "in the same regions , the dissipated gravitational energy bound by the smbh is given by @xmath23 .",
    "comparing the two energy sources , we find that stellar energy dominates over the gravitational at a critical radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for a salpeter initial mass function in thompson et al .",
    "this clearly states that @xmath27 for a sf disk with @xmath28 , implying that the self - gravitating regions are governed by stellar energy rather than the gravity of accreting gas bound by sbmhs .",
    "the underlying physics mainly involves several dynamical processes coupling with thermal ones .",
    "fragmentation into clouds happens when the cooling timescale @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rotation frequency ( gammie 2001 ) . for a keplerian rotating disk , @xmath31yr , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33yr , where @xmath34 is the cooling function and @xmath35 is the density of hydrogen molecules ( smith & mac low 1997 ) . here",
    "estimates of @xmath36 are conservative since we do not include the metallicity .",
    "we find that the fragmentation of the disk is inevitable , leading to star formation .",
    "the self - gravitational instability drives collisions among clouds , leading to effective viscosity ( e.g. duschl & britsch 2006 ) , but it could be less important than the viscosity due to turbulence produced by the snexp .",
    "the dispersion velocity obtained from the fragmentation is given by @xmath37 ( collin & zahn 2008 , hereafter cz08 ) , where @xmath38 is the cloud mass , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the collision and gravitational interaction between two clouds , respectively .",
    "for massive clouds with a mass of @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 , which is too small compared with the keplerian rotation @xmath43 to excite strong enough turbulence for transportation of angular momentum in the disk ( @xmath44 pc ) .",
    "the snexp - driven turbulent velocity is of the order of the keplerian velocity ( see  3.1 ) and is regarded as the main sources of turbulence , that is to say , @xmath45 is suggested by 2d numerical simulation ( rozyczka et al .",
    "we note that cz08 underestimate the snexp - driven viscosity since the snexp would be anisotropic in the fast rotating disk ( see detailed arguments in  3.1 ) .",
    "detailed processes for forming stars in the disk were studied by collin & zahn ( 1999 , hereafter cz99 ) and cz08 .",
    "they considered the following processes : accretion from the sf disk to form the stars , stellar winds subsequently shutting off such accretion flows , the effects of the accretion process opening gaps in the sf disk around the forming stars , and migration of stars toward the smbh .",
    "cz99 argue that these stars may be driven to migrate toward the black hole by density waves in the disk , but may be influenced by the cavity opened by the stellar wind .",
    "if the timescale of migration toward the smbh is shorter than the evolutionary timescale of main sequence stars , the snexp - driven turbulence does not work .",
    "however , there is actually another mechanism to stop migration toward the smbhs , which is that the accretion of stars from the disk increases not only its mass , but also the angular momentum of the stars .",
    "the gain of angular momentum makes the stars migrate outward .",
    "the accretion timescale of stars is @xmath46yr inside the disk environment ( artymowicz et al .",
    "1993 ) . comparing @xmath47 with @xmath48 given by equations ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) in cz99 , we find that the stars stay at approximately the location where they were born since generally @xmath49 works , where @xmath48 is the radial migration timescale .",
    "this allows us to neglect the migration of stars , without obvious influence on the evolution of the stars .",
    "finally , stars reach their maximum mass when stellar winds balance their accretion from the disk ( cz08 ) and they then maintain that mass until they explode as sn .",
    "the complicated interplay between these processes leads to uncertainties in the maximum and minimum masses of stars .",
    "the initial mass function of stars is not obtained in a self - consistent way , but the uncertainties arising from accretion and stellar winds remain as free parameters in the initial mass function ( see  3.2 ) .",

    ", we use a simplified version of its structure , which are approximately the simple version of a self - gravitating disk ( e.g. goodman 2003 ) .",
    "the smoothed structure of the self - gravitating disk is determined by toomre s parameter @xmath50 , and is justified in this section .",
    "it has been demonstrated by thompson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that such a disk is supported by the radiation pressure due to star formation , yielding @xmath14 .",
    "the surface density @xmath51  and the height of the sf disk @xmath52  are given by equations ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) in goodman ( 2003 ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the validity of this smooth model of a star forming disk is discussed below .",
    "fragmentation of the disk depends on the rotation , density , temperature , metallicity and cooling of individual clouds , whose necessary condition is generally fulfilled as discussed in the previous section .",
    "details of the star formation process and macrophysics are poorly understood ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) , especially in the accretion disks . here",
    "we will use the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law of star formation rates ( kennicutt 1998 ) . in ngc 5194 (",
    "kennicutt et al . 2007 ) and ngc 4252 ( rahman et al .",
    "2010 ) , this law works over all scales from the entire galaxy to the nuclear region , although in m33 ( onodera et al . 2010 ) it does appear to break down at the scales of giant molecular clouds . as a way to move ahead and test the observational consequences of star formation , we will assume that the kennicutt - schmidt law is at least approximately correct for the accretion disk .",
    "the results found here will still be qualitatively correct unless the star formation rates are completely unrelated to the gas surface density . according to the kennicutt - schmidt law , @xmath56 , where @xmath51 is the surface density of gas in unit of @xmath57 , and we have the surface density rate of star formation @xmath58 we find that @xmath59 depends more strongly on the smbh mass ( as @xmath60 ) and the distance to the smbhs than on the eddington ratio ( as shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "this leads to the conclusions that 1 ) agn with less massive smbhs may have different properties from ones with more massive smbhs , yielding observational implications such as narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ; and 2 ) there will be a strong @xmath61 gradient within individual objects that will lead to a steep metallicity gradient in the sf disk though there is radial advection as shown in  3.1 , resulting in a difference in the metallicity measured by different indicators .",
    "we discuss these two points in the following sections .",
    "the clumpy sf region is composed of molecular clouds , evolving stars , snexp ( including the sn shells ) , and diffuse hot gas .",
    "the structure of the disk is determined by the mutual interaction among these components ( mckee & cowie 1975 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we use a smooth model of a self - gravitating disk to represent in analytical form the averaged properties of the disks , but we explicitly consider a clumpy structure when we determine the way in which gas is heated by snexp to diffuse into the broad line regions . the validity of the  smooth \" thin disk can be justified by the fact that the characteristic distance ( @xmath62 ) among clouds in the star forming regions is much less than the global size of the disk .",
    "the self - gravitating timescale @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the density of clumps , should not be longer than the crossing timescale of turbulence through a cloud @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the characteristic length of clouds and turbulence velocity .",
    "otherwise , the cloud will be destroyed to form stars .",
    "this yields the density of clouds as @xmath68 .",
    "we then have @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the mean density of the disk and @xmath71 is used . for typical values of the disk , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 cm at @xmath75 ,",
    "and we have @xmath76 cm , which is significantly smaller than the radius of the disk .",
    "the  smoothed \" model is a quite good approximation of the star forming disk .    we should point out that a constant opacity is used for the self - gravitating disk as by goodman ( 2003 ) .",
    "collin & hur ( 1999 ) study the influence on the disk of opacity , as a function of density and temperature .",
    "they show that the surface density of the disk is given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 for solar abundance and zero - metallicity , respectively ( see equations 8 and 12 in collin & hur 1999 ) .",
    "though the opacity @xmath16 can change by a factor of @xmath79 , approximating the opacity as a constant only leads to a factor of a few uncertainty in the surface density .",
    "we note that the disk structure displays several solutions with thermal instability etc . depending on the opacity ( hur et al .",
    "the resulting star formation in the disk is not very sensitive to the opacity based on the simplified model of goodman ( 2003 ) , but we keep these approximations in mind .    finally , we note that star formation in the disk is a self - regulating process in light of the toomre s parameter , as argued by cz99 . in this paper",
    ", we neglect this dependence of star formation , but use the kennicutt - schmidt law for simplicity .",
    "although the kennicutt - schmidt law might be modified somehow in the disk , this approach still illustrates the effects of star formation there .",
    "we would like to point out that star formation takes place in the regions with a keplerian velocity of @xmath80 .",
    "detailed process of star formation needs an efficient way to get rid of the angular momentum of the protostars , perhaps , magnetic fields as a potential mechanism could be invoked to do so .",
    "in the sf disk , the evolution of a snexp ( here meaning the sn shell ) fully depends on its surroundings .",
    "it may conveniently be divided into three stages ( e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "1980 and shull 1980 ) : 1 ) rapid ejection followed by expansion with a nearly constant velocity ; 2 ) adiabatic expansion in the sedov - phase ; 3 ) the snowplow phase governed by radiation loss when a dense shell forms at the outer boundary .",

    ", the snexp ensures that evaporation of molecular clouds via shocks can drive thermal diffusion of the hot gas above the sf disk into the broad line regions .",
    "table 1 gives a summary of the present model including the typical parameter values for an smbh with @xmath94 , which are useful for future observational tests .",
    "there are debates as to the strength of snexp - driven viscosity in the star forming disk .",

    "we use a constant @xmath103 in the entire sf disk in equation ( 4 ) .      as a natural consequence of the ongoing star formation in the disk as described above , the metallicity is enriching and evolving along with the feeding of the smbhs . as shown by the cooling function in equation ( 25 ) (  4 ) , metals play a key role in the cooling of the hot gas in the sf disk . in order to find the diffusion of hot gas",

    "the metal - rich gas then mixes with its surroundings , and is advected inward by the inflows while simultaneously being evaporated by the snexp heating .",

    "metallicity has a strong influence on the cooling rate of hot plasma ( e.g. bhringer & hensler 1989 ) .",

    "we should note that this mass rate could be the lower limit since we have conservatively taken @xmath224 .",
    "additionally the diffusion rates of hot gas are comparable with or exceed the eddington limit of a @xmath94 smbh , but they are still smaller than the rates of the inflows developed from the inner edge of a dusty torus ( see wang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "figure 4 _ right _ panel shows the evolution of the hot gas and its diffusion with the metallicity .",
    "we find that temperature and the density of the hot gas vary only slightly with @xmath220 , but the diffusion rates vary by a factor of a few .",
    "the higher the metallicity , the lower the diffusion rates . for an individual agn evolving with metallicity ,",
    "the thermal diffusion becomes weaker .",
    "it should be pointed out that the diffused hot gas is actually still bounded by the potential of the smbh .",

    "it is therefore expected that the diffusion of the hot gas is not sensitive to the eddington ratio of the accreting smbh , but @xmath231 moderately sensitive to the smbh mass . for an individual quasar , @xmath232 ,",
    "implies that quasars in the late phase of a single episode should have relatively weaker outflows , but higher metallicity .",
    "last , the diffusion rates of the hot gas may be greatly enhanced if @xmath233 for a more top - heavy sf disk .",
    "it should be kept in mind that equation ( 32 ) is a conservative estimate of the diffused hot gas from the disk .",
    "we note that the hot gas inside the sf disk may have soft x - ray emission .",
    "total emission from the hot gas can be simply estimated by the free - free emission in the disk .",
    "we have @xmath234 erg / s , where the emissivity of the free - free emission is @xmath235 .",
    "the free - free emission in soft x - rays and radio would be negligible .",
    "it should be noted that in our model the thermal diffusion is driven by a different mechanism than in the model of winds driven by starbursts ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) . the present model stresses the role of evaporation of the molecular clouds through their heating . in the starburst model ,",
    "bubbles are energized as winds by the kinetic energy of the starburst in a physically much thinner medium than the sf disk .    finally",
    "the influence of the diffusion of hot gas on the disk can be estimated from the ratio of the disk accretion rate to the mass rate of the diffusion .",
    "we find that @xmath236 is significantly smaller than the inflow mass rates ( @xmath237 ) ( see figure 2 in wang et al .",
    "the influence of the diffusion of hot gas on the disk can be generally neglected in the star forming regions , but it might be important in the region around the self - gravity radius , where the diffusion mass rates are comparable to the accretion rates onto the smbh . in this region , the complicated interaction between the warm gas and the accretion flow onto smbhs may lead to some observable features in x - ray spectra . we leave this for a future investigation . on the other hand , cooling of the hot winds may be balanced by the efficient compton heating driven by the x - ray photons emitted from the hot corona above a shakura - sunyaev accretion disk .",
    "the final fate of the outflowing hot gas is a very complicated question , since this gas will be subject to a complex array of processes as it moves out into the host galaxy",
    ". this will be the main topic of a follow - up paper , but in the next section we outline some observable effects on the blr gas .",
    "the blr gas is assumed to be supplied by diffusion of the hot gas",
    ". there can be a factor of ten or more metallicity difference between the inner and the outer parts of the sf disk , leading to observable consequences .",
    "this gas is then photoionized by the radiation from the accretion disk .",
    "we can expect that the outer regions of the blr are fed by the outer part of the sf disk .",
    "since this gas is farthest from the continuum source , it will have a relatively low value of the ionization parameter , defined by @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath240 is the averaged energy of ionizing photons and @xmath241 is the density and temperature of the ionized gas , respectively .",
    "emission lines with low ionization energy will be produced from this low ionization line ( lil ) region .",
    "the inner regions of the sf disk , being closer to the ionizing source , will have a higher value of @xmath242 , and thus produce high ionization lines ( hils ) .",
    "it should thus be possible to examine the metallicity gradients through comparison of the lils and hils . additionally , measuring metallicity differences between the hil and lil regions can provide a rough estimate of the age of the single episode of the smbh activity , and potentially even reveal its evolutionary track .",
    "it is thus expected that the metallicity measured from the lils should be lower than the hils . in principle , this theoretical prediction can be examined by separate measurements of the metallicity in the hil and lil regions .",
    "generally , metallicity in agns is much higher than in their host galaxies .",
    "this is true even after extrapolating the observed metallicity gradient in galaxies to the innermost regions .",
    "however , it is much more difficult to measure the metallicity in agns than in stars .",
    "the original way to measure agn metallicity ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) was to use hil ratios of or /  together with detailed photoionization models .",
    "later , broad - lil ratios such as , and were used together with the hil lines to estimate the metallicity based on the loc model ( hamann et al .",
    "2000 ; warner et al .",
    "2003 , but see the original suggestion of shields 1976 ) .",
    "warner et al . ( 2003 , see figure 10 ; and 2004 ) found that the metallicity measured by is systematically lower than by a factor of a few for a sample of @xmath243 agns and quasars .",
    "although they did not realize that these differences could be intrinsic and instead took the averaged values to be the overall blr metallicity , their measurements agree well with the factor @xmath244 metallicity gradient across the sf disk that we find here . assuming that both kinds of metallicity indicators properly reflect the real metallicity , the systematic difference found by warner et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2004 ) clearly supports the idea that there is gradient of star formation within the central 1pc region .",
    "additionally , the detailed nature of the broad line regions is still very poorly understood .",
    "however , the present simple model can conveniently explain the significant difference of metallicity represented by and   ( warner et al .",
    "2003 ; 2004 ) .",
    "further high quality spectra of quasars are needed to measure the metallicity accurately enough to determine the quasar s evolutionary status .",
    "we would like to point out that there should be little or no mixing of metals between the lil and hil regions , even though the dynamical time scales in the hil and lil are only a few tens of years . in a new model of the blr based on the present sf disk",
    ", we will show ( wang et al .",
    "2011 in preparation ) that there is a mass circulation between the blr and the sf disk , keeping a constant mass in the lil regions , whereas the cold clouds in the hil could be blown away by the radiation pressure .",
    "the two regions maintain a stationary state , showing different metallicity in lil and hil regions .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the study by wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of the properties of star forming disks within the central 1 pc regions of quasars and agns , where star formation can drive an adequate fuel supply to the smbh through snexp .",
    "we have made progress in the following areas :    * a metallicity equation is derived , unveiling a metallicity gradient in the star forming disk .",
    "we find that metallicity can reach up to @xmath245 in the innermost regions of the disk and a few times solar abundance in the outer part . as an integrated physical parameter",
    ", metallicity is evolving even in disks that dynamically are in a steady state , and the metallicity can reach saturation in a few @xmath180years .",
    "metallicity can be used as a `` clock '' for indicating the age of a star forming disk during one episode of smbh activity .",
    "* thermal diffusion with a mass rate of @xmath0 inevitably developes from the star forming regions .",
    "this rate is comparable to the outflow rates estimated from x - ray spectroscopic observations .",
    "the hot gas diffused above the disk is likely to be the source of the observed broad - line - region gas .",
    "* the blr should then share the metallicity gradient of the sf disk .",
    "the metallicity gradient might already have been measured by the systematic difference in the metallicity measured by the low ( e.g. ) and high ( ) ionzation lines in agns and quasars .",
    "the properties of the star forming disk have important theoretical and observational consequences .",
    "it is well known that agns have many separate ingredients , including the blr ( with separate hil and lil regions ) , the nlr , the accretion disk , the self - gravitating disk and the torus .",
    "however , the origins of these different components as well as the physical connections among them are extremely poorly understood .",
    "since the diffusion rates of the hot gas evaporated from the sf disk are comparable with the accretion rates of the smbhs , the presence of this gas will have significant consequences . the ionized gas exposed to the agn irradiation will have a very complicated fate in light of agn heating , cooling and coupling with its dynamics .",
    "however , we speculate that the accumulation of the diffused gas continually supplied from the sf disk can drive the formation of blrs through dynamical and thermal instabilities .",
    "dependence of the properties of the diffused hot gas on the radius would then lead to onion - like structures within the broad line regions .",
    "it is often suggested that broad line regions , broad absorption lines , and ",
    "warmer \" absorbers are the result of outflows ( e.g. murray & chiang 1997 ) .",
    "the present scenario provides a gas supply to the broad line regions , warmer absorbers etc .",
    "this points towards a unified model in which broad line clouds , outflowing clouds and warmer absorbers are intrinsically linked with the star forming disk , and hence with the accretion disk around the smbhs .",
    "such a model will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( wang et al .",
    "2011 in preparation )",
    ".    a direct proof of the presence of massive stars in the core of a sf disk would be the detection of the spectral features of red supergiants . in the near future ,",
    "alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) spectra of galactic nuclei should have the sensitivity to detect the co bandhead in the near ir that is predicted by our scenario .",
    "another approach would be to use powerful instruments to search for ca ii triplet ( @xmath246 ) absorption from the nuclear regions .    finally , newly born agns and quasars may have rapidly growing accretion rates with self - similar behaviors such as @xmath247 ( yu et al .",
    "2005 , but see schawinski et al .",
    "this would allow us to obtain the general solution for the metallicity evolution during the early stage of the agn phase .",
    "interestingly , the metal - poor quasars have metallicities similar to their host galaxies ( @xmath248 ) , but they are only a small fraction of quasars ( fu & stockton 2007 ) . as has been suggested by silk & rees ( 1998 ) and others , ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with higher star formation rates ( e.g. laag et al . 2010 ) and low metallicity are likely to be in the early stage of agn activity , soon after their birth .",
