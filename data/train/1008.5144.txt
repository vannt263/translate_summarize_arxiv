    "fig : echem ] .",
    "the important energy quantities are therefore , the ( 2,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) singlet - triplet energy splittings @xmath58ev and @xmath59ev , and the spacing @xmath60ev between the two and three electron triangles .",
    "these energies are extracted from the transport data as detailed in ref .  .",
    "in this section , we show that current can flow through the triplet channel in the ` hole ' transport regime when certain conditions are met for the singlet channel .",
    "specifically , the singlet unloading rate should be equal to or larger than the singlet loading rate .",
    "we then show that these conditions are met in our data .",
    "we first obtain the conditions on the singlet transport rates by developing rate equations , in analogy with those found in ref .  .",
    "we consider the contribution of loading and unloading rates of each channel to the total transport rate through the channel .",
    "starting from the ( 1,1 ) state , the double dot is loaded into one of the ( 2,1 ) states from the left lead .",
    "the mean loading rate is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the loading rates into the singlet - like and triplet - like states from the left lead respectively .",

    "this implies that if @xmath68 , then the current through the double dot is essentially a triplet - like channel current .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the ratio of the loading to unloading rates of the singlet - like channel .",
    "we now estimate the loading rates for the singlet - like and triplet - like channels at point d on the ` tail ' of the transport data ( fig .  1 , main text ) .",
    "starting from the ( 1,1 ) charge configuration , the loading rates into the ( 2,1 ) states are strongly energy - dependent at the left barrier  @xcite and are given by @xmath69 where the amplitude @xmath70 , the energy dependent coefficient @xmath71 , @xmath72  @xcite and @xmath73 at point d.    the loading rates of the triplet - like and singlet - like states at point d are therefore @xmath74      we now estimate the unloading rates for the singlet - like and triplet - like channels at point d. unloading of the triplet - like ( 2,1 ) state occurs when the electron in the right dot tunnels out across the right barrier , followed by interdot tunneling from the ( 2,0 ) to the ( 1,1 ) state .",

    "the unloading rate for the triplet - like channel is therefore given by @xmath77    the unloading rate of the singlet - like state is dominated by spin - flip cotunneling , which involves two low - probability processes : the spin - flip and the cotunneling .",
    "the spin - flip can be understood as the small probability @xmath78 that the @xmath79 state contains the @xmath80 singlet .",

    "however , we can estimate it using the parabolic well approximation , where the eigenstates of each dot are those of the 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator  @xcite . for a dot size of approximately 100  nm and an interdot distance of approximately 200  nm  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath89  mev when there is maximum overlap between the first excited eigenstate ( ` 2 ' ) of the left dot with the ground eigenstate ( ` 3 ' ) of the right dot .",
    "this corresponds to the axis of the wavefunction of the first excited eigenstate being aligned with the axis of the double dot . a more realistic estimate",
    "where the angle between the wavefunction axis and the axis of the double dot is 45 degrees , gives @xmath90 given that @xmath58ev  @xcite , the singlet - triplet mixing probability is @xmath91    the cotunneling rate @xmath82 from the left lead into the right dot and out to the right lead , can be estimated from point f of the transport data ( fig .",

    "1(b ) of the main text ) .",
    "this cotunneling has contributions from both the singlet and triplet channels .",
    "the singlet - like channels , @xmath92 , are suppressed by energy dependent tunneling , as is one of the triplet - like channels , @xmath93 .",
    "the other triplet - like channel , @xmath94 is suppressed by the slow spin - flip process . in principle",
    ", we can not separate these contributions at point f. however , we can consider a worst case scenario where the cotunneling current at point f is dominated by the channels without spin - flip , @xmath95 and @xmath93 , with very little energy dependent tunneling . in this case , the cotunneling rate through the triplet - like spin - flip channel , @xmath94 , is given by eq .",

    "( s21 ) to be valid , i.e. @xmath98 .",
    "since the ratio @xmath99 , the current along the tail is of the same order of magnitude as the current in the singlet - like triangle away from the resonant left edge .    below the tail ,",
    "cotunneling is energetically unfavorable , while above the tail , cotunneling is suppressed through energy dependent tunneling .",
    "@xmath100 is therefore much smaller on both sides of the tail .",
    "loading of the singlet - like channel , which is strongly energy dependent , increases below the tail , further suppressing current .",
    "however , suppression of the singlet - like channel loading rate above the tail could mitigate the decrease in the unloading rate , so that the ratio @xmath101 remains small , allowing some current flow . that there is small current above the tail",
    "is observed in transport data at larger biases  @xcite , where the loading of the singlet - like channel can be more strongly suppressed as it moves lower in the bias window .",
    "therefore , although spin - flip cotunneling involves two mechanisms of lower probability , namely cotunneling and triplet - singlet mixing , the dampening effect on the tunnel rate is mitigated by the small loading probability into the singlet - like channel .",
    "the effect of spin - flip cotunneling is to open a thin window in the triplet - like bias triangle to allow triplet - like channel current .",
    "in this section , we propose an experiment to verify the singlet - triplet mixing mechanism described in the main text .",
    "we note that in the spin - flip process described in the text , the loading of the third electron into the right dot is through cotunneling from the left lead .",
    "since it is the singlet - triplet mixing mechanism that we are interested in , this loading can also be from the tunneling of an electron from the right lead , as described below .",
    "using pulsed gate techniques such as those described in ref .  ,",
    "the double dot could be first loaded into the ( 2,0 ) singlet state ( a ) , then pulsed such that the @xmath24 level of the right dot is below the fermi level of the right lead ( b ) , allowing for the loading of an electron into the right dot from the right lead .",
    "loading of the @xmath21 level will not cause singlet - triplet mixing but this is suppressed because of energy dependent tunneling .",
    "next , a gate pulse can then be applied such that the triplet - like level @xmath20 is above the fermi level of the left lead ( c ) .",
    "a singlet - triplet spin - flip will lead to a tunneling out of an electron via this level .",

    "<S> however , it is also possible to load the red singlet - like @xmath9 level . in this case , as the right dot discharges , the system is likely to end up in the @xmath10 state , where transport is energetically uphill and therefore blockaded ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the tail in the transport data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data](a ) is bright along its entire length because the chemical potentials for the right dot and the left lead are the same . </S>",
    "<S> point d is the brightest point along the tail because of the fast inter - dot tunneling when @xmath3 is aligned with @xmath4 .    </S>",

    "<S> this measure of @xmath25 is also consistent with other measures of st splitting  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the significant role cotunneling plays in the triplet and triplet - like transport channels of the two and three - electron regime is interesting . in both cases , cotunneling by itself </S>",
    "<S> does not contribute significantly to the current , but plays the role of allowing transport to resume by lifting the singlet blockade .    </S>",
    "<S> current will flow through the triplet - like channel when the loading rate is comparable to the unloading rate in the singlet - like channel  @xcite . in the supplementary information </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate these rates and find that they are indeed the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the blockade is therefore lifted about as quickly as it is encountered . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , spin - flip cotunneling enables transport through the triplet - like channel . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting current is that of the unblockaded , triplet - like channel , reduced by a factor of @xmath26  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , transport via the triplet channel was not observed in the experiments reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> in that study , a conventional hole model was sufficient to describe transport in the three - electron regime , as consistent with the fact that transport occurred through the ground states in the two - electron regime .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to compare the intra - dot spin - flip times with inter - dot tunneling times for gaas and si . in gaas devices , </S>",
    "<S> spin - flip times range from @xmath27200 @xmath28s for a two - electron dot  @xcite , to @xmath270.85 ms ( at 8  t  @xcite ) and @xmath29  s ( at 1  t and 120  mk  @xcite ) for single electron dots . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments report spin - flip times in single electron dots in si  @xcite ranging from 40  ms ( at 2  t  @xcite ) to 6  s ( at 1  t  @xcite ) , at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the tunnel coupling for the same si double dot studied here was found to be 10 ns ( 25 ns ) in the elastic ( inelastic ) tunneling regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , tunnel couplings for electrostatically gated semiconductor double dots are tunable and can be both larger or smaller than spin - flip times .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that a pulsed gate experiment  @xcite exhibiting phenomena arising from singlet - triplet mixing , as described above , is presented in @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the conventional hole model of transport in the three - electron regime fails qualitatively because of the importance of excited state transport . </S>",
    "<S> the hartree - fock formalism , with relevant parameters fitted to transport data , leads to the description of a model which explains all of the features of the transport data , including a novel process of spin - flip cotunneling .    </S>",
