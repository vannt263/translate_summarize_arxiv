    "the formation scenario for massive protostars is comparatively uncertain compared with the low - mass star - formation paradigm @xcite . during their formation , massive stars ( @xmath78m@xmath4 ) deposit copious amounts of energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and their natal cloud through jets , outflows and expanding ionisation fronts .",

    "the well studied massive protostars cep a hw2 @xcite and iras 20126 + 4104 @xcite , for example , are thought to be surrounded by keplerian discs and have jets powering massive outflows in a direction perpendicular to the disc plane .",

    "the outflow phenomenon thereby provides one potential link between low- and high - mass star formation scenarios .",
    "although detection of outflows alone is insufficient to draw conclusions on the existence of a single star - formation process , correlations between outflow energetics and bolometric luminosity over several orders of magnitude have been interpreted as evidence of a common outflow - driving mechanism that scales with luminosity @xcite .",
    "few previous studies of outflows from massive protostars have used representative and unbiased samples that are large enough to deal with the observational uncertainties and intrinsic scatter in properties .",
    "@xcite find outflows in 21 of 26 targets and see evidence of similar trends in a sample based on a catalogue of massive star formation sites using iras point sources @xcite .",
    "such a sample , containing sources at a range of distances , may be subject to distance biases that overwhelm the significance of the correlation and suffer from confusion in the luminosity values due to the low resolution of iras ( 2 - 5arcmin at 100@xmath8 m ) .",
    "@xcite examined a sample of 11 same - distance ( 2-kpc ) sources and found only tentative evidence for a scaling of outflow energetics with bolometric source luminosity in the massive protostar regime , although their sample was small .",

    "still , larger samples are required to investigate outflow dynamics and kinematics from representative selection of massive protostellar regions .",
    "the red msx source ( rms ) survey @xcite specifically identifies massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) and hii regions drawn from the msx mid - infrared survey of the galactic plane @xcite , which has higher angular resolution ( 18arcseconds ) than earlier iras point - source catalogues of massive star formation sites @xcite and therefore is less affected by confusion in the galactic plane .",
    "this is the second of two papers investigating the same sample of 99 mysos and very compact hii regions drawn from the rms sample .",
    "it is the first large sample of molecular outflows from high - mass and high - luminosity ysos that is not dominated by malmquist - type biases . in many previous attempts to look at high - mass ysos ( e.g. @xcite , and the high - mass , @xmath1010@xmath11l@xmath4 component of the definitive @xcite study ) , accounting for the distance dependencies and possible biases reduces the significance of the correlations .",
    "the conclusion of a single driving mechanism in both low- and high - mass outflow sources therefore requires more careful examination .    in the first of the two papers , @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    ", we identified and analysed the properties of the dense cores in these massive star - forming regions .",
    "the luminosities and masses of the cores were shown to be unaffected by significant distance biases out to 6kpc , and are representative of the range of luminosities in the whole rms myso / hii - region sample subject to a similar distance cut ( @xmath3250 objects ) .",

    "we compare our results with outflows from single low - mass protostars , known to have jet - driven outflows in their early stages of evolution .",
    "our sample of protostellar outflows are emanating from cores associated with massive star formation @xcite .",
    "these cores harbour many protostars , some of which are massive , although these cores are at varying stages of evolution as identified by the myso or hii region classification .",
    "it is not necessarily true that the massive protostars within these cores are responsible for powering the outflows however ; i ) massive stars may form differently to lower mass stars and not power jets that are thought to drive outflows ; ii ) what appears to be a massive outflow could be explained by a low - mass protocluster , iii ) the massive stars in these cores may be too evolved such that they no longer power the outflows observed .",
    "these scenarios are tested below .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] presents the total outflow force of each outflow source versus luminosity , for our distance - limited sample of massive protostellar cores , together with outflows associated with class-0 and class - i , young low - mass ysos from @xcite , @xmath3class - i , low - mass outflows from @xcite ( their m7 method in determining force being comparable to ours using @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ) and the proposed class-0 analogue , ir - dark high - mass protostars from @xcite . for consistency ,",
    "the factor of @xmath32.9 has been applied to our massive outflows to scale for an average 57.3@xmath24 inclination angle used in @xcite .",
    "the continuity between the low - mass and high - mass samples is striking .",
    "when extended , the best - fit line to the low - mass class - i sources of @xcite , log@xmath25log@xmath26(l@xmath4 ) , intersects directly with our massive outflow sample , and , lies slightly below the location of both the low- and proposed high - mass class-0 analogue sources @xcite . at face value",
    "this suggests , at least for lower mass protostars , a decrease in outflow force with age . when comparing with our more luminous , more massive sources we can not distinguish between myso and hii regions at this resolution ( paper i ) to establish if they are at a different evolutionary stages and there are no clear segregations between source types observed .",
    "furthermore , offsets between different data sets may also mimic such a trend dependent on methodology and inclination corrections .",
    "the best fit line to our more massive outflows is slightly shallower , log@xmath27 log@xmath26(l@xmath4 ) , and extrapolates back to the region between class-0 and class - i low mass outflows ( figure [ fig7 ] , black dotted line ) . at this stage",
    "it is unclear whether the shallower slope is due to these cores being protoclusters , rather than a _",
    "outflow from a single protostar .",
    "as previously noted by @xcite the slope of all sources in @xcite is shallower @xmath30.7 , although a linear fit ( log - log ) to only their sources where @xmath28100l@xmath4 indicates a slope of @xmath31 .",
    "independent of the best fit lines , the outflow force is seen to scale over @xmath36 orders of magnitude in luminosity .    in terms of outflow force",
    ", our ir - bright mysos and compact hii regions are positioned as high - mass analogues of class-0/i , low - mass ysos , if simply extrapolating back the fit to our data .",
    "a similar correspondence is found if we examine the mass - luminosity relationship as in paper i ( see figure [ add_ml ] ) . the high - mass , class-0 protostar sample of @xcite is be positioned below the plotted stellar line as are our cores , albeit with lower luminosities and masses .",
    "note , the class 0/i classification does not directly indicate a comparable evolutionary stage ( or age ) for our high - mass sources , as we do not resolve individual protostars within the cores .",
    "the result in figure [ fig7 ] is very similar to that in @xcite , who examined a sample of distant outflows associated with methanol - maser sources , which are reliable flags of high - mass star formation @xcite , comparing the outflow force to the clump mass .",
    "this is unsurprising , since their clump masses have a near - linear relationship with the embedded myso luminosity @xcite , as do our cores ( paper i ) .",
    "however , given that their sources are much more distant , physically larger , more massive and not proven to be a representative sample , we do not undertake a rigorous comparison .",
    "similarly , we acknowledge that there are higher luminosity targets in the sample accumulated by @xcite with which we could also extend our plot , however ; some sources are much more distant ; the sample is not representative ; sources have rough luminosity estimates ; and many different methods were used to calculate the outflow parameters .",
    "when considering the hypothesis of a scaled outflow driving mechanism , the question arises as to whether there is an upper limit to the yso luminosity range to which this scaling applies , beyond which there might be a different driving mechanism and , hence , underlying star - formation process . here",
    "we examine whether the most massive stars ( m@xmath78m@xmath4 , l@xmath710@xmath11l@xmath4 ) still form via disc accretion and have jets producing outflows , or if the massive outflows from luminous cores are actually a combination of flows from the many low and intermediate - mass sources i.e. can a low / intermediate mass protocluster explain the characteristics of a ` single ' high - mass outflow .",
    "this also simultaneously tests the scenario where the massive protostars in the cluster are more evolved and are no longer powering the outflows .",
    "higher - resolution observations may eventually provide the answer but , meanwhile , we can use the simple model , as used in paper i , to predict the outflow force from an embedded cluster under the assumptions that the protostars have formed coevally and that force scales with luminosity .",
    "we create a population of protostars following the salpeter power - law imf ( using only stellar masses from 0.5 to 150 m@xmath4 ) for a range of model cluster masses and then calculate the corresponding luminosities of the cluster using stellar luminosities from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5.11 ) for masses ranging from 0.5m@xmath4 to 6m@xmath4 and from @xcite for masses @xmath76m@xmath4 .",
    "the outflow force for each protostar in the protocluster is calculated according to the relationship for low - mass , nearby , protostars in @xcite , log@xmath25log@xmath26(l@xmath4 ) , which are more likely to be ` single ' protostars .",
    "the blue lines in figure [ fig7 ] show the results of the luminosities against the calculated outflow force in each of our test cases .",
    "as noted in paper i , we have not attempted to model a cluster of evolving protostars in detail , given that high mass stars evolve more quickly than lower mass stars , and hence reach their zams luminosity more quickly .    where the luminosity arises from the complete cluster we find the summed total cluster outflow force is closely consistent with the observations ( dotted blue line in figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "all protostars up to @xmath330m@xmath4 must contribute to the outflow force in order to match the observations .",
    "the @xmath29=30m@xmath4 limit is set by the most massive protostar predicted by the model in our most luminous core where d@xmath306kpc .",
    "this result supports a similar outflow mechanism for high - mass protostars and thereby supports an upscaled star formation scenario .",
    "we can also consider the case where massive ` single ' protostars do not form in the same way as their low - mass counterparts , and therefore do not produce outflows at all .",
    "this simultaneously tests whether a low / intermediate protocluster can explain the outflow force , and also if the massive protostars have actually stopped powering outflows .",
    "we test this by assuming only protostars with masses up to @xmath38m@xmath4 , classically low and intermediate mass , contribute to the total outflow force .",
    "we find a break in the luminosity - force relation ( dashed blue line ) at a cluster luminosity of @xmath36400l@xmath4 .",
    "this is the protocluster luminosity where the most massive protostar reaches @xmath38m@xmath4 .",
    "this line can be used to highlight two key results .",
    "firstly , the shallower slope of outflow force versus luminosity after @xmath36400l@xmath4 is not consistent with the observations .",
    "thus the scenario where massive stars do not produce outflows either due to a different formation mechanism or being too evolved is unlikely in the case of imf coeval protoclusters with luminosities over @xmath36400l@xmath4 .",
    "the second result is that , shortwards of @xmath36400l@xmath4 the line fits almost centrally through the observations and at face value suggest that low / intermediate mass protoclusters can explain the outflow force observed in cores where @xmath286400l@xmath4 , in cases where higher resolution observations are not available to resolve the sub - structure of the core and identify specific outflow drivers .",
    "the above tests support the interpretation that massive protostars power outflows and form in a similar fashion to low - mass protostars .",
    "as noted above , the most massive protostars in a cluster are likely more evolved ( closer to zams ) than the low / intermediate mass ones .",
    "we attempt to account for the non - coeval evolution and test the influence of the most massive protostars only by curtailing the outflow contributing protostars to the most massive 30 percent in the protoclusters .",
    "the dot - dashed blue line in figure [ fig7 ] sits slightly below that extrapolated from the low - mass protostars in @xcite but is entirely consistent with the data , suggesting that the most massive protostars in the clusters are responsible for the outflows alone .",
    "recent modelling of outflows from clusters of stars by @xcite do suggest that the most massive protostars dominate the force and power , even when multiple outflows are combined .",
    "these authors model four intermediate to massive protostars that form roughly coevally ( and have similar masses ) from the same accretion disc structure and all produce individual outflows with the same common axis of projection . on the largest scales , at similar resolution to the jcmt observations presented in this paper , a single outflow from the system would be seen .",
    "even their sub - arcsecond , simulated atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations only just begin to separate the bow heads of each outflow , but still can not disentangle the individual flows .",
    "it is possible that the scaling relationship assumed above , from @xcite is not representative , being a sample of specifically bipolar low - mass class i sources . indeed ,",
    "other samples appear to find shallower slopes e.g. @xmath31 , @xcite .",
    "however , if we repeat our above analysis with this shallower slope ( and placing the line such that it still fits the protostars in the lower - mass end , i.e. adjusting the offset ) , the same key results are obtained . the reported break in luminosity at @xmath36400l@xmath4",
    "does occurs at a lower outflow force , but in general this does not change the conclusion that low / intermediate protoclusters can be responsible for outflows from cores with luminosities below 6400l@xmath4 .",
    "we also reiterate the importance of ensuring that different samples of outflow sources use the same analysis methods in order to be fully compatible and thus remove the ambiguity of estimating offsets to shift the relationships in log - log plots .",
    "independent of the relationship adopted from low - mass outflows , considering the simplistic model with an ideal , coeval salpeter imf distribution of protostars , we find the most likely conclusion is that vast majority of sources in an embedded young cluster contribute to the outflow dynamics and that mysos with at least @xmath330m@xmath4 must contribute to the observed flows .",
    "the rms cores are protoclusters and most show a single outflow except for a few cases where multiple outflows are tentatively seen , with non - aligned axes of projection ( e.g. , g010.8411@xmath002.5919 and g109.8715@xmath3202.1156 ) . in these sources ,",
    "the outflow parameters of the system are calculated as a whole ( as separation of each flow is subjective due to limited spatial resolution ) and are indistinguishable from the other ` single ' outflows we detect .",
    "high - resolution observations do support this as @xcite present vla sio observations where three massive protostars transitioning to hii regions within a 2000au core all have outflows contributing to one large - scale ( @xmath75000au ) massive outflow .",
    "our model curtailing the contributing sources to the most massive 30 percent is likely a realistic case for these cores where the massive protostars are closer to the zams and dominate over the outflow dynamics .",
    "these conclusions fully support an upscaled outflow mechanism and therefore star formation scenario to massive stars .",

    "there are several pieces of evidence in the data that might point to this model .",
    "firstly , the correlation coefficient for the relationship between outflow mass and core mass , along with that of outflow momentum versus core mass ( see table [ tab5 ] ) , is the highest of those measured and therefore contains the least scatter , suggesting that one of these two may constitute the basic relationship .    , against source luminosity .",
    "there is only a weak correlation over the large range of luminosity , although note each outflow has a range of velocities as used in the calculation of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that @xmath43 = @xmath44 is independent of luminosity , while the evidence for a correlation between the weighted - mean velocity and luminosity is only barely significant in this sample ( at the 2@xmath45 level , see figure [ fig10 ] and table [ tab5 ] ) . note that , since the momentum and energy are calculated via the summation over every velocity bin and spatial position , the velocity used is the ` bulk ' intensity - weighted velocity @xmath46 . the slope of a least - squares linear fit ( log - log ) to the @xmath46 vs @xmath47 relationship is",
    "@xmath30.12@xmath330.04 , see table [ tab6 ] .    with this in mind , the second piece of evidence in the data is that the details of the relationships with luminosity seen in figure [ fig5 ] are consistent with the way in which the dynamical time based properties are calculated .",
    "the slope of the linear fit ( log - log ) to the dependence of the outflow mass on @xmath47 is @xmath48 , that of the flow momentum is @xmath49 and of flow energy @xmath50 and the relationships involving the mass flow rate , force and power are similar .",
    "these slopes differ by only 1@xmath51 but are consistent with the sequence of increasing powers of @xmath37 in their calculation ( refer to table [ tab6 ] ) .",
    "importantly , we see that the scatter in the relationships also increases in the same sequence .",
    "this suggests that the additional powers of @xmath37 in calculating @xmath35 and @xmath36 , etc . , is not revealing a more fundamental physical relationship and that @xmath52 has the most basic relationship with @xmath47 , although this , in turn arises because @xmath47 is linearly dependent on @xmath53 .",
    "the hypothesis is , therefore , that the entrained mass is the fundamental property of the outflow , that this depends only on the mass available in the dense core , and that the core mass is the only parameter amongst those examined here with a direct physical relationship to the luminosity of the embedded protostars ( see paper i and @xcite ) . thus , all the correlations between the flow , force and power with luminosity could arise simply because there is more mass available to be entrained in massive cores , and these massive cores themselves also tend to contain more luminous protostars , i.e. ranging from single sources , to a cluster , the entrained mass of the outflow is directly related to the mass available to each individual protostar .",
    "such that in the case of a cluster , each protostar drives an outflow related to the protostar s _ envelope _ mass , being a fraction of the total core mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such an interpretation , of course , renders any conclusion regarding the outflow - driving mechanism suspect , since this remains unconstrained and any process that accelerates the core gas with similar entrainment efficiencies will produce essentially the same effect .",
    "this , in turn , implies that accretion rates may not be directly inferable from mass outflow rates for high - mass sources as per @xcite , as these assume a particular family of momentum - conserving driving mechanisms with particular efficiencies . indeed ,",
    "even if more massive protostars drive more powerful outflows , and have higher infall rates ( which are intrinsically linked to accretion ) , one would require knowledge of the efficiencies of the outflow mechanism for high - mass protostars before inferring accretion rates .",
    "there are several _ a priori _ arguments that may support this hypothesis .",
    "firstly , regardless of how the outflow material is entrained , @xcite pointed out that the mechanism accelerating the gas of the molecular outflow should be either momentum- or energy - conserving , but not both . therefore , the virtually equal correlations of outflow force and outflow power with source luminosity always found in studies such as this can not simultaneously represent a physical relationship .",
    "the terminal wind / jet velocity is required as an input for calculation of the outflow force or outflow luminosity in the different regimes ( see eqns . 25 and 26 , * ? ? ?",
    "using the wind / jet speed should indicate a constant value of either outflow force or outflow luminosity , while the other parameter scales with source luminosity , dependent on the nature of the outflow ( i.e. either momentum- or energy - conserving ) .",
    "secondly , in low - mass sources , the jets are known to leave the densest regions of the molecular cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and travel much further out into the diffuse interstellar environment ( often many parsecs but , in any case , on a scale much larger than the molecular outflow ) , only showing up as bow - shocks when stopped by the diffuse ism .",
    "thus , an unknown fraction of the jet energy or momentum , depending on what is conserved @xmath0 most likely momentum @xmath0 must be deposited in the molecular outflow component and this should create enough scatter in the measured parameters of the latter to wipe out any correlations . yet",
    "low - mass outflow sources produce the most significant correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "whether or not the outflows from high - mass sources are mostly jet - driven is still uncertain ( e.g. as the case for g010.8411@xmath002.5919 , g078.1224 + 03.6320 and g109.8715 + 02.1156 , see above ) .",
    "furthermore , the parameters of the large - scale orion molecular outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with the standard dynamical relationships @xcite but this outflow is now thought to have been caused by a single impulsive , possibly explosive event @xcite , unlike the jet - driven flows seen in at least the low - luminosity sources .",
    "this alone must raise doubts over the conclusion that the universal correlations imply a single outflow - driving mechanism .",
    "of course , this mass - only model also predicts that the outflow length @xmath54 will be determined mainly by the density distribution and size of the core .",
    "this does not appear to be the case ( figure [ fig_r ] ) , however it may be that such a relationship is masked by scatter from the random outflow orientation and by highly variable collimation .     for blue- and red - shifted outflow lobes versus the core radius from paper i. open and filled symbols are mysos and hii regions , respectively ,",
    "while the colours represent the blue- and red - shifted lobes , and circles and squares are ` y ' and ` s ' aperture flags .",
    "clearly there is no correlation between these parameters.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another consequence of this model is that the dynamical timescales obtained from @xmath55 can not be related to real source ages , except in the youngest flows in which a driving jet has not yet reached the edge of the core . in sources",
    "in which a jet has left the dense core , @xmath34 may give only an estimate of the time taken for the jet driven shock to reach the low - density outer regions of the core envelope .    the power law relationship in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "is @xmath56 .",
    "this is not significantly different enough from a direct linear relationship to warrant too much explanation . if it were , then",
    "there would have to be some relationship between the core mass and the fraction of the core affected by the outflow ( diminishing if flatter than linear , e.g. ) implying some kind of mass - dependent collimation of the flow .",
    "if the preceding model survives further analysis , then the collimated nature of massive protostellar outflows , i.e. , their bipolarity , is the remaining feature that unites them to the low - mass version of the phenomenon .",
    "this may be due to the ubiquitous presence of disc structures related to accretion .",
    "bipolarity is clear for some of the outflows from this single - dish survey .",
    "some synthetic observations reproduce the bipolar morphology of high - mass outflows , even if driven by ionisation feedback alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the predicted outflow parameter values are lower than those observed and hence magnetic forces are again suggested as an acceleration mechanism .    the recent review by @xcite details that , irrespective of the numerical modelling approach , successful models of jets all include some aspect of a rotating disc and a magnetic collimation and driving force .",
    "only a rare few high - mass sources have been independently studied and indicate a scaled - up picture of low - mass star formation ( e.g. cep a hw 2 ; @xcite , rotating material , @xcite , proper motion radio jets , and @xcite outflow and jet aligned magnetic fields ) .",
    "as argued in the review by @xcite a high - resolution , high - sensitivity study of a significant sample of massive protostellar outflows is required .",
    "such a study is still lacking , although the sample in this work provides a firm footing for such an investigation as these high - mass star forming regions clearly drive outflows .          in the earlier stages of massive star formation , the convective surface layers of the protostar may be conducive to the production of magnetic fields which then supply the magneto - hydrodynamic forces required for jet production , powered by the stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "jets , driven and regulated via the complex relationship of mhd forces and disc accretion , may therefore be inherent to massive - star formation ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "one method used to investigate jets as the powering mechanism of molecular outflows is to examine the mass spectrum , i.e. , the power - law relationship between intensity and velocity @xcite , in which a break can often be identified in the higher - velocity flow that may be due to molecular dissociation caused by a jet shock @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that optical - depth correction must be undertaken to establish an accurate slope for the relationship , especially at lower velocities .",
    "the left and right panels of figure [ fig8 ] show the results for both optical - depth - corrected and optically thin velocity regimes .",
    "generally , the slopes are consistent with those found for low - mass outflows @xcite .",
    "however , no clear breaks are seen in the higher - velocity , optically thin regions and single linear relationships fit the mass - spectra of the individual cores reasonably well .",
    "the optical - depth - corrected and optically thin slopes also span the same ranges .",
    "there is no evidence of a recently accelerated or coasting outflow component @xcite .",
    "@xcite do not report breaks in the slope of the combined outflows from the two clusters they investigate .",
    "this confirms that we could not expect to see a break in any of our high - mass cores as they likely contain multiple , possibly different direction and inclination outflows , which when combined would wash - out any underlying breaks that are seen for single , jet - driven low - mass outflows .",
    "the similarity of the slopes for low- and high - mass sources could in itself , be interpreted as due to a similar outflow - acceleration mechanism . higher sensitivity and higher resolution observations",
    "are required to detect the very high velocity flow and confirm its origin from a _ single _ driving source .",
    "@xcite note a steepening mass - spectrum for the high velocity outflow @xmath7 40kms@xmath6 in their high - sensitivity single dish observations of g078.1224 + 03.6320 , whereas the jcmt observations here only detect a @xmath57 of @xmath340kms@xmath6 .",
    "simulations and observations suggest that molecular outflows both can , and can not have a profound effect on the natal core ( e.g. @xcite and also see @xcite ) .",
    "c@xmath17o data presented in paper i show 30 sources ( d@xmath306kpc ) have smooth velocity gradients across the cores , six of which are aligned with the outflows presented here , suggestive of their strong influence .",
    "we can compare the energy content of the outflows to the turbulent kinetic energy in the core gas and the gravitational binding energy of the core ( assuming @xmath58 , @xcite ) . in the case where the thermal motions contribute little to the measured full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the core line emission",
    ", the turbulent energy can be calculated via e@xmath59 = ( 3/16ln2)@xmath60fwhm@xmath61 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the turbulent energy , calculated using @xmath53 from paper i and where the velocity fwhm is measured using c@xmath17o ( 3@xmath02 ) , versus the outflow energy . for the binding energy calculation , the core radii listed in paper i are used .",
    "the outflow energy on average can fully account for the turbulent energy of the core and also equates to @xmath385 percent of the binding energy , even without inclination - angle correction .",
    "hence we might conclude that outflows from massive ysos contribute significantly to the core turbulent kinetic energy and are a significant source of mechanical feedback .",
    "@xcite conclude that jet - driven outflows act to maintain the turbulence in a molecular cloud , provided there was already an initial disruption .",
    "however , figure [ fig9 ] ( right ) , shows that the cores that do not contain outflows have turbulent kinetic energies that are consistent with those that do .",
    "this suggests that the core turbulence ( on scales of @xmath30.4 to @xmath32pc ) is not driven by the local input from outflows .",
    "if the jets that accelerate the molecular flows tend to leave the dense cores , only a fraction of their momentum and energy might be deposited into the dense core gas , and this only in local regions . in the low - mass core ,",
    "b59 , @xcite see remnant u - shaped cavities and ridges that are a result of the direct impact of outflows on the less dense , local material .",
    "however , they also see other velocity structures in the c@xmath17o data of the denser core , e.g. gradients and infall motions , and although the outflows do have enough energy to fully drive the turbulence , it is not straightforward to conclude that the outflows alone are the predominant production mechanism .    for our cores",
    "there are many plausible explications however , simply the outflows are not detected in these sources ( e.g. plane of sky confusion , or weak ) or there are alternative inputs of turbulence ( local hii regions , external winds / shocks , or interactions of the sources within the cores below our resolution ) . since turbulent energy tends to flow from larger to smaller scales , we do not expect such localised phenomena to transfer energy to the whole cloud for example .",
    "although , if energy is transferred on core scales at a cavity wall interface , we would require higher spatial resolution to isolate these interaction regions where the cavity is within the beam ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "from a sample of 99 sources , 65 and 20 have been identified to be definitely driving outflows and have some evidence for outflow , respectively .",
    "the remaining 14 show no signs of outflows and have gaussian @xmath1co line profiles . for a distance - limited subset ( d@xmath306kpc ) ,",
    "59 have definite outflows , 17 have some evidence of outflows and 13 do not have evidence of outflows .",
    "the kinematic and dynamic parameters have been calculated for all sources with outflows and with evidence for outflows , but only where it was clear how to separate the outflow material from the diffuse ambient emission in integrated maps .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 calculated using a position - variable dynamical timescale @xmath63 ( applied to massive protostellar outflows for the first time ) are shown to be consistent with those obtained using a single @xmath34 estimate via @xmath64 . using these dynamical timescales and sfe values established in paper i",
    ", we infer a time - averaged accretion rate of @xmath32@xmath6510@xmath5m@xmath4 onto these massive star - forming cores .",
    "all outflow parameters scale with source luminosity and core mass .",
    "there are no intrinsic differences between the cores classified as mysos or hii regions .",
    "the outflows are driven by many protostars within a cluster ( given the resolution of the observations ) .",
    "specifically , the outflow force scales directly from samples of low - mass protostars , suggesting that our sample consists of high - mass class 0/i analogues , in terms of position in luminosity - outflow force , and luminosity - mass diagrams .",
    "the relationship between outflow force and luminosity is consistent with all the sources in a coeval star - forming cluster contributing to the outflow force .",
    "models in which the massive protostars do not contribute to the outflows are not consistent with the observations , although these models do suggest outflows from low / intermediate mass protoclusters can explain ` single ' outflows from cores with luminosities @xmath306400l@xmath4 .",
    "models curtailing the mass of the contributing protostars to only the most massive 30 percent are coincident with the observations , suggesting that the massive protostars dominate over the outflow dynamics .",
    "the data support a scaling up of the star formation process for massive protostars up to @xmath330m@xmath4 in a star - forming cluster .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the scaling relationships is that the molecular outflow parameters are determined almost entirely by the entrained mass , which is set by the available core mass",
    ". this model does not require a single driving mechanism for the _ molecular _ outflow as any form of mass acceleration , explosive or continuous , would produce the observed correlations .",
    "the bipolar nature of some of these high - mass outflows may be the key to supporting a scalable driving mechanism from low - mass sources .",
    "although the outflow energetics are comparable to the turbulent energy in the dense cores , we find that cores with outflows have similar kinetic energies to those without .",
    "such turbulence could be provided by alternative means or by undetected outflows . at the scales",
    "probed we can not establish the local impact these outflows have .    the sample presented is ideal for high - resolution , high sensitivity follow - ups in order to disentangle the smaller groups of protostars driving the outflows , establish their bipolar nature and the underlying driving mechanism .",
