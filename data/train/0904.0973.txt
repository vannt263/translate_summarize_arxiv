    "an optimal computer is a universal decoding algorithm . by the definition , @xmath6 is thought to represent the amount of randomness contained in a finite binary string @xmath7 , which can not be captured in a computational manner . in particular , the notion of program - size complexity plays a crucial role in characterizing the _ randomness _ of an infinite binary string , or equivalently , a real .    in @xcite we introduced and developed a statistical mechanical interpretation of ait .",
