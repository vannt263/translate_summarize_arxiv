    "recently the importance of the study of kaon production induced by real and virtual photons on nucleons and nuclei has been emphasized due to the development of accelerators like mami , jlab , lns , elsa , spring-8 , graal , etc .",
    "in particular , the availability of very high luminosity beams has provided the opportunity to study the electromagnetic associated strangeness production  @xcite of a strange and an anti - strange particle .",
    "the cross section for weak associated strangeness production is obviously much smaller than that of the electromagnetic one .",
    "however , weak interaction allows for processes where only one strange / anti - strange particle is produced , ( @xmath3 ) and these reactions could have a substantially lower threshold .",
    "for instance , the threshold for electron induced weak @xmath4 production on a proton is around 600 mev whereas it is 1.5 gev for electromagnetic production , as an additional kaon is required .",
    "the study of these reactions could provide valuable information on the coupling constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 that govern the interaction of the su(3 ) lightest baryon octet with the pseudoscalar mesons and also their @xmath7 decays .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath8 combination , related to the neutron @xmath7 decay , is very well known , but the knowledge of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 values is less precise @xcite .",
    "also , one may investigate the @xmath9 dependence of the weak axial form factors of nucleons and hyperons . in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of doing such experiments and present a quantitative analysis of the charged current reaction in which a kaon / antikaon is produced without conserving @xmath10s .",
    "this study is based on our earlier works on neutrino / antineutrino induced single kaon production  @xcite and the same formalism is applied here to study one kaon production off the nucleon obtained from electron as well as positron beams .",

    ", we will only discuss electron processes .",
    "let us remark that at energies below 1.5 gev and in electron induced reactions , the presence of an antikaon in the final state fully defines the process , in the sense that it is necessarily a charge exchange weak production process and there is no other additional strange particle in the final state .",
    "this is so because of the higher energy threshold of any other mechanism that could produce antikaons .",
    "therefore , there is no need to measure other particles in coincidence .    to estimate the number of events for single kaon production we have considered a luminosity of @xmath103 @xmath104 for mami",
    ", that corresponds to a 10 cm liquid hydrogen target at an electron beam current of 20 @xmath105a as described in  @xcite . for tjnaf",
    ", we take a luminosity of @xmath106 @xmath104 that corresponds to a current of 100 @xmath105a and a larger liquid hydrogen target  @xcite that has been used on the measurement of parity violating electron proton scattering . under these conditions and for 1.5 gev electrons , we would have some 480 events per day for the reaction @xmath107 at tjnaf ( 48 at mami ) . for the @xmath108 reaction",
    ", we would get 320 events per day at tjnaf ( 32 at mami ) .",
    "certainly , the numbers could be changed by using different targets and/or current but equally important is the efficiency in the kaon detection , that depends on the kaon kinematics and the detector .",

    "[ fg : ang ] and  [ fg : mom ] at an electron energy of e@xmath109 gev , that could be appropriate for both the tjnaf and mami facilities . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ang ] , the three channels under study are forward peaked , specially for the @xmath110 production .",
    "the momentum distributions peak around 0.3 gev for @xmath111 while for @xmath112 it peaks around 0.6 gev .",
    "this is because the contact term , which has dominant contribution for @xmath113 production channels , peaks at low @xmath114 . for @xmath37 production",
    ", there is a significant contribution from s - channel @xmath83 term , which flattens for a wide range of @xmath114 .",
    "its interference with the contact term shifts the peak for the kaon momentum distribution .",
    "gev , width=377 ]    as an example , we have applied in our calculation some cuts corresponding to the kaos spectrometer at mami . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the kaon momentum has been restricted to the range @xmath115 and the kaon angle to the range @xmath116 . for electron energies of 1.5 gev",
    ", these cuts would reduce the signal by a factor @xmath117 . additionally , taking into account the kaons survival probability in kaos",
    "@xcite would further reduce the number of events by a similar factor .",
    "thus , the measurement of these cross section at currently existing facilities , with their luminosities and detectors would require quite long runs .",
    "distribution at electron energy @xmath118 gev , width=377 ]    we have also investigated how the @xmath9 dependence of the weak form factors would affect our predictions . as mentioned above ,",
    "very little is known for this dependence given that the existing experimental information comes from beta decay that occurs for very low @xmath9 values . in this calculation",
    ", we are assuming a simple dipole dependence and the same form factor for all background channels .",
    "thus , we can only obtain some idea on the uncertainty / sensitivity of our results to the form factors . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : q2 ] , the processes have a small contribution from large @xmath9 values .",
    "thus the size of the cross section depends moderately on the form factors .",
    "for instance , by changing the dipole mass(@xmath119 gev ) , a 20% up / down , one gets changes of about 10% for the neutron channel and about 28% for the two proton channels at @xmath120",
    "we have also studied the sensitivity of the electron induced cross sections to the d and f parameters , that govern the hyperon beta decays . for that , we have modified the d value by a 5% while keeping @xmath121(=d + f)=1.26 constant .",
    "our results show cross sections that grow around 5% for the proton processes and decrease by a similar factor for the neutron case .",
    "this implies that some ratios , such as @xmath122 on deuteron could be a sensitive probe for these parameters .",
    "gev for the @xmath123 channel for a dipole mass @xmath124 and @xmath125 gev . the second curve ( @xmath125 gev ) has been scaled to get the same area.,width=377 ]    the measurement of the @xmath9 dependence would require the detection of the final nucleon in addition to the kaon .",
    "however , also some purely kaonic observables show some sensitivity to the form factors .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fg : mom2 ] shows how a larger dipole mass pushes the kaon momentum towards larger values .    in summary",
    ", we have developed a microscopical model for single kaon production off nucleons induced by electrons / positrons .",
    "this model is based on the su(3 ) chiral lagrangians .",
    "the calculations are performed up to an electron / positron energy of 1.5 gev where we expect this model to be quite reliable .",
    "the parameters of the model for the background terms are @xmath44 , the pion decay constant , cabibbo s angle , the proton and neutron magnetic moments and the axial vector coupling constants for the baryons octet , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings .",
    "all of them are relatively well known . to account for the @xmath9 dependence we have taken a global dipole form factor as in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the electron induced process",
    ", we have also considered the contribution from the @xmath2 resonance term , the weak couplings for which has been obtained using su(3 ) symmetry from those of the @xmath65 resonance .",
    "we predict cross sections that , although small , could be measured at current experimental facilities .",
    "furthermore , our results could facilitate the study of the hyperon / nucleon weak coupling constants and their form factors .",
    "we should remark that for some of the studied channels and for the considered energies , there are no electromagnetic competing processes that could hinder their investigation , and therefore , the present study of the single kaon production cross section induced by electrons / positrons opens an interesting window for research for strangeness physics in the weak interaction sector .",
