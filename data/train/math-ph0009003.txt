    "the roots of the mass renormalization program of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) trace back to the late @xmath2 and early @xmath1 centuries notion that the electron s inertia has a purely electromagnetic origin .",
    "this notion was central to the pre - quantum attempts of the time to construct a consistent electromagnetic theory of matter and radiation that would unify electrodynamics and mechanics , now known as classical electron theory .",
    "when lorentz proposed that abraham s  @xcite purely electromagnetic , strictly rigid spherical electron ( see appendix a.2 ) had to be replaced by an electron that undergoes the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction , the laws of special relativity began to take shape in the papers of lorentz  @xcite , and poincar  @xcite ; see  @xcite for an excellent account of the historical developments .",
    "ironically , special relativity and renormalization later contributed to the demise of relativistic lorentz electrodynamics ( led ) more than quantum mechanics . of course , quantum mechanics removed led from the list of contenders for a truly fundamental electromagnetic theory of matter and radiation , but it did not jeopardize the viability of led as a physical theory in the classical limit . after all , bohr s correspondence principle was undisputed in the quest for the fundamental quantum theory , and as such one would not have been , nor would one be unhappy with a consistent classical microscopic relativistic theory of electromagnetic matter and radiation that could serve as the empirically correct classical limit of a consistent quantum theory .",
    "special relativity on the other hand had emancipated itself in the works of einstein  @xcite and minkowski  @xcite as a theory of spacetime structure independent of led or any other particular matter model  @xcite .",
    "thus , when lorentz objected to the uhlenbeck ",
    "goudsmit  @xcite proposal of an electron spin magnetic moment by pointing out that led would forbid the required magnitude of about one bohr magneton because the purely electromagnetic electron would have to reach an impossible equatorial rotation speed of about 10 times the speed of light ( see @xcite , p. 35 ) , he had furnished an argument that  eventually  weighed heavily against the physical sensibility of led itself , and which has persisted ever since .",
    "judged from our modern perspective on mass renormalization  @xcite , the purely electromagnetic calculations by lorentz  @xcite and his contemporaries do , however , not qualify as proper .",
    "a proper renormalization analysis would investigate the ` flow ' toward vanishing bare rest mass for a consistent relativistic led _ with _ positive bare rest mass ( ` massive ' led ) in which the bare particle parameters of the model can be chosen such that the particle charge , the particle spin magnetic moment , and the renormalized particle mass match the empirical electron data without involving superluminal gyration speeds of the model electron .",
    "if the limit of vanishing bare rest mass exists , this limit would define a renormalized led which in a sense completes lorentz program of a purely electromagnetic electron theory , and whose physical viability is no longer objectable to on basis of the superluminal arguments that grounded the original lorentz theory .",
    "in this paper we will show that such a properly renormalized approach to the lorentz program of electrodynamics does indeed lead to a satisfactory lorentz electrodynamics . for simplicity",
    "we consider only a single lorentz electron coupled to the maxwell  lorentz fields in the whole spacetime .",
    "the extension to a many particle theory does not pose any difficulties .",
    "we first present a novel , manifestly lorentz - covariant massive led which displays several crucial features expected of a realistic , consistent classical electrodynamics .",
    "in particular :    * the dynamical equations constitute a cauchy problem for the evolution of the physical state of massive led ; * scattering does not change the nature of the renormalized particle , which moves as a _ soliton _ ; * the parameters of the bare particle can be chosen such that charge , magnetic moment , and renormalized mass of the ` free ' particle can be matched to the physical electron data without involving superluminal gyration speeds .",
    "we then study the renormalization flow to vanishing bare rest mass of our empirically matched massive led .",
    "the ` renormalized led ' which emerges in the limit is characterized by the following additional features :    * the equatorial gyration speed reaches the speed of light @xmath3 precisely in the limit of vanishing bare rest mass so that the bare gyrational mass converges to a nonvanishing contribution .",
    "it is fitting to call this a ` photonic ' mass ; * the renormalized spin magnitude is a _",
    "derived _ property in our model .",
    "it turns out to be @xmath4 rather than @xmath5 , with corrections of order @xmath6 ( sommerfeld s fine structure constant ) , and we have @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 or @xmath9 . * our renormalized led is , strictly speaking , a classical field theory with ultraviolet cutoff corresponding to the physical electron s compton length !",
    "it is not unexpected that in our classical theory the relation between spin and magnetic moment holds with a land factor @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "since we operate here with a minimalist model , it is not _ a priori _  clear whether a slightly more intelligently constructed classical model would not account also for the correct @xmath11 . in any event ,",
    "the issue of the @xmath12 factor should not be confused with the superluminal speed problem of lorentz .    among the many physically correct features of the model",
    ", the truly rewarding one is its soliton dynamics . without it the rest mass , magnetic moment and spin of the renormalized particle",
    "would typically be altered by each scattering process , and the theory would then simply fail to account for the classical motion of electrons and their electromagnetic fields .    another gratifying feature is the size of the renormalized , purely electromagnetic model electron , whose radius comes out to @xmath13 physical electron compton lengths , about @xmath14 times larger than the somewhat misnamed `` classical electron radius '' @xmath15 .",
    "our renormalized led is thus intrinsically equipped with the ultraviolet cutoff at which heuristic discussions  @xcite have traditionally set the spatial limit of applicability of classical electrodynamics as a physical theory .",
    "remarkable is furthermore that the cauchy problem for the state evolution bears a certain resemblance to the problem of motion of a black hole in general relativity .",
    "unexpectedly , massive led thus provides a playground for this much harder problem of general relativity .",
    "our model owes much to the monumental work of nodvik  @xcite .",
    "although in nodvik s lorentz - covariant massive led one can match the particle parameters to the empirical electron data for charge , mass , and magnetic moment without encountering superluminal gyration speeds , one can do this only for sufficiently large bare rest mass .",
    "more specifically , the renormalization flow toward smaller bare rest mass terminates at about @xmath16 of the empirical electron mass , i.e. before reaching the purely electromagnetic limit of vanishing bare rest mass , and its spin is then merely about @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to this deficiency , nodvik s massive led suffers from a serious dynamical defect which it shares with the purely electromagnetic models of abraham and lorentz ; namely , the initial value problem is singular .",
    "interestingly , both deficiencies of nodvik s massive led are caused by his choice of bare rest mass distribution , which concentrates all the bare inertia at the center of the particle so that its bare moment of inertia vanishes . by endowing the particle with a bare rest mass distribution that gives it a strictly positive bare moment of inertia",
    "our massive led overcomes both deficiencies and , in this sense , improves decisively on nodvik s massive led .",
    "the presentation of our results is organized as follows . to begin with , in section 2",
    "we stipulate the relativistic notation used in this paper . in section 3",
    "we discuss the relativistic kinematical prerequisites of the model .",
    "massive led is defined by a lorentz invariant action functional that ` minimally couples ' the dynamics of the bare particle and the electromagnetic fields .",
    "we first formulate the relativistic mechanics of a gyrating bare particle for given minkowski force and torque of unspecified origin ( section 4 ) and then , in section 5 , present nodvik s  @xcite covariant maxwell ",
    "lorentz equations which determine the electromagnetic fields also in our model , given the kinematical history of the charged particle .",
    "our action functional for massive led is introduced in section 6 , where we also discuss its symmetries and associated conservation laws .",
    "the dynamical equations of our massive led are presented in section 7 . in section 8",
    "we address the cauchy problem for the state evolution .",
    "the scattering problem is discussed in section 9 , where we will see that the renormalized particle behaves like a soliton . in section 10 the renormalization group flow toward vanishing bare rest mass is studied , in detail for the stationary particle , and in an outline for the dynamical particle .",
    "we conclude the main body of our paper in section 11 with a summary and an outlook on follow - up work and open problems .",
    "in particular , we also speculate about possible implications of our results in the quest for a consistent qed .    in order not to interrupt the flow of the presentation , some technical material adapted from  @xcite ,",
    "e.g. the derivations of the euler - lagrange equations , has been relegated to appendix a.1 . to facilitate the comparison with nodvik s model  @xcite",
    ", appendix a.2 contains a brief discussion of the point mass limit in which our massive led formally reduces to the massive led of nodvik  @xcite . in particular , we explain that this limit is singular and severely overdetermines the initial value problem .",
    "incidentally , a similar assessment holds for abraham s  @xcite purely electromagnetic versions of semi - relativistic led with and without spin .",
    "since the ill - posedness of the initial value problem for the purely electromagnetic abraham model is itself a new observation , appendix a.3 gives a concise summary of the semi - relativistic massive led and its purely electromagnetic , singular limit .",
    "there we start with the massive model with spin and show next that the more familiar semi - relativistic massive ` led without spin ' actually is a theory with spin in ` hidden ' form , obtained from the massive model with spin in a non - singular limit .",
    "we then address the singular purely electromagnetic abraham limit .",
    "a fair list of references has been selected from the vast pertinent literature .",
    "various equivalent conventions for the minkowski space formalism exist in the literature . by and large ,",
    "we here follow the conventions of the book by misner , thorne and wheeler  @xcite",
    ". however , since the model is essentially a flat space model , we will not introduce forms . instead , throughout this work we use four - vectors and tensors constructed from them .",

    "for example , the standard foliation of a lorentz frame @xmath266 into affine space slices of the form @xmath267 is generated by the function @xmath268 , which has a constant timelike four - gradient , @xmath269 .",
    "there are uncountably many foliations of spacetime among which one has to find any one that is _ compatible _ with the structure of the dynamical equations , preferably a convenient one .",

    "in particular , the four - velocity has to satisfy @xmath274 , and the anti - symmetric rank - two euler tensor has to satisfy @xmath275 .",

    "lorentz equations impose the constraint that @xmath172 satisfy the three - divergence part of the maxwell ",
    "lorentz equations , which fixes the longitudinal part of @xmath172 as a passive attribute of the charged particle .",
    "these are all _ local constraints _ imposed by relativity , which occur also in the traditional limiting theories , i.e. the relativistic point charge mechanics in given external force fields , the mechanics of a point spin in given external torque fields , and the maxwell electrodynamics with given source terms , in all of which cases the constraints are known to propagate in time if they are satisfied initially",
    ". this will be true also for our massive lorentz electrodynamics .",
    "however , our covariant first - order dynamical equations are also mildly _ non - local _ , and this is going to be reflected in the compatibility conditions to be satisfied by the foliation of spacetime .",
    "namely , since the first - order proper - time derivatives of @xmath170 and @xmath130 at proper - time @xmath111 are given ( implicitly ) in terms of integrals of the fields over the particle s support in its instantaneous space slice of simultaneity , the transversal part ( i.e. the dynamical degrees of freedom ) of @xmath276 must be known for all @xmath277 satisfying @xmath278 ( recall that the passive longitudinal part of the field @xmath276 is not a dynamical degree of freedom ) .",
    "hence , we say that a foliation of spacetime is _ compatible _ with a world - line @xmath279 of an extended lorentz electron ( i.e. , a particle history ) if each leaf of the foliation contains precisely one of the sets @xmath280 ( for simplicity , we assume that @xmath281 )",
    ". a compatible foliation sets the spacetime parameterization w.r.t . which the maxwell ",
    "lorentz equations must be solved in order to enable the evaluation of the minkowski force and torque .",
    "a compatible foliation is of course not known explicitly until the particle world - line is known ; it has to be determined along with the particle world - line and the fields by solving the second variation equations for the extrinsic curvature of the leaf @xmath260 coupled with the constraint equations of gauss  codacci and gauss in the complement of the sets @xmath277 satisfying @xmath278 , which is a non - linear free boundary problem .",
    "interestingly , these circumstances inject technical elements from general relativity into this special relativistic theory .    _",
    "remark : _ no foliation is compatible with a particle history that is not ordered in the sense described earlier ( see fig.1 and 2 ) .",
    "the condition that the particle history be ordered imposes size restrictions on the accelerating fields .",
    "indeed , we easily find locally consistent data for which the particle s three - acceleration in its instantaneous lorentz rest frame exceeds the value @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the radius of the particle .",
    "for such accelerations , part of the support of the particle in its instantaneous space slice of simultaneity will be launched _",
    "backward in lorentz time _ rather than forward , and this motion does not generate an ordered history .",
    "this implies the following bound on the particle s initial three - acceleration in the lorentz frame in which the particle is instantaneously at rest , @xmath284 which has to be translated into bounds on the accelerating field strengths in the instantaneous particle rest frame .",
    "we will soon see that these bounds on the field strengths are about @xmath285 times the particle s self - fields at it s surface which , happily , is way outside the physically reasonable range of data for a classical electrodynamics .",
    "last not least , the condition that the gyrational speed for points on the particle s equator must be subluminal imposes a size restriction on @xmath130 , viz .",
    "( recall that @xmath95 ) @xmath286      we now formulate the initial value problem for the states .",
    "we begin by specifying the generic initial data on a convenient initial leaf .",
    "the compatible foliation itself is characterized subsequently by dynamical equations which together with the equations of massive led ( rewritten w.r.t .",
    "the compatible foliation ) pose a nonlinear , implicit cauchy problem for the joint evolution of the state and the leaf of the foliation on which the state is defined .      since by a suitable spacetime translation we can always transform to a lorentz frame",
    "in which the event of the particle s initial spacetime position is at the origin of that lorentz frame , and since by a suitable lorentz boost we can furthermore transform to another lorentz frame with the same origin but in which the particle s initial three - velocity vanishes , and since finally we can choose the proper - time of the particle equal to zero at that initial event , the cauchy data for the world - line @xmath236 can be chosen conveniently as @xmath287 notice that @xmath288 satisfies the constraint @xmath289 required of a four - velocity .",
    "moreover , by at most a space rotation of this lorentz frame we can achieve that @xmath290 , the dual vector to @xmath291 , has only a single non - vanishing component , say the @xmath292 component , @xmath293 , with @xmath294 satisfying ( [ eq : gyrosubc ] ) but otherwise at our disposal .",
    "the cauchy data for the particle s gyrograph @xmath295 are then of the form @xmath296 clearly , @xmath291 is anti - symmetric , and since @xmath297 , also of space - space type w.r.t . @xmath298 .",

    "the initial fields are chosen in accordance with the asymptotic condition that @xmath313 as @xmath314 , the real part as @xmath315 , the imaginary part sufficiently fast for surface integrals at infinity involving @xmath316 to vanish .",

    "unfortunately , the standard foliation is generally not a compatible foliation , for notice that any world - line is the soul of the tubular set of events @xmath318 , called the future _ world - tube _ of the particle , inside of which the foliation is necessarily given by the @xmath111-indexed affine segments @xmath319 which intersect with the standard leaf of lorentz time @xmath270 but are generally strict subsets of that leaf .",
    "however , one expects that it is possible to select a compatible foliation whose leafs , sufficiently far away from the world - line , will arbitrarily closely approximate the leafs of the standard foliation of the initial lorentz frame , i.e. @xmath300 parallelly transported in lorentz time . by further choosing the @xmath270-parameterization of the compatible foliation to be lorentz time at spatial infinity , by selecting the corresponding value of @xmath111 through the identification @xmath320 , and by parameterizing points in @xmath260 by the points @xmath321 through following the integral curves of @xmath322 , we obtain a foliation which nearly coincides with the standard foliation in most of spacetime , except for a small `` wiggle '' accompanying the world - line of the particle . notice that the world - line is one such integral curve , so that in this parameterization the segment of the world - tube that belongs to @xmath260 is always centered at the origin of @xmath300 .",

    "having established the invertibility of such a stationary @xmath400 , we now turn to the discussion of initial data which do not launch a stationary solution .",

    "we have @xmath422 which vanishes identically ( irrespective of @xmath172 ) only for a so - called ` particle without spin ' for which @xmath423 ( more on particle models without spin in appendices a.2 and a.3 ) .",

    "we now comment on the first two problems .",
    "the first problem can be controlled by an appropriate _ a priori _  choice of the bare rest mass distribution .",
    "it suffices to discuss two representative choices , volume and surface inertia .",

    "in such a case it takes only a finite amount of gyrational energy to bring an equatorial point to the speed of light .",
    "this signals that the choice of a continuous @xmath145 will create a mathematically delicate problem when it comes to the question whether the gyrational dynamics remains subluminal , and so one may expect that this choice may easily lead to a singularity in finite time .",
    "in contrast , for the surface inertia choice for @xmath145 , the function @xmath411 is not only increasing and convex , but satisfies @xmath461 as @xmath462 . in this case",
    "it would require an infinite amount of gyrational energy to bring an equatorial point to the speed of light , so that it is to be expected that the dynamics will not lead to a singularity in finite time .",
    "these considerations show that surface inertia is preferable , although we do not claim that this requirement is necessary for global or even local existence .",
    "the second problem is much harder to control _ a priori_. for a moving particle one now has to rule out that constructive interference of electromagnetic radiation fields leads to a violation of the acceleration limit ( in our lorentz frame ) @xmath463 where @xmath283 is the radius of the particle and @xmath464 . at the initial instant @xmath465 ,",
    "the particle is at rest and the estimate ( [ eq : condonaccel ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : initaccelbound ] ) .",

    "scattering with a non - moving particle is considerably simpler because the family of space slices of simultaneity for the particle are just the standard foliation of spacetime , as for a stationary particle .",
    "the only dynamically active degree of freedom of the particle is its euler tensor , or in the stationary lorentz frame of our foliation , the angular velocity vector @xmath490 .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field are restricted to be compatible with the condition that the particle sit still at the origin of space .",

    "the best understood situation is when the particle s axis of rotation does not change during the evolution , say @xmath491 , so that @xmath492 is the only remaining dynamical particle degree of freedom . for all admissible initial conditions corresponding to these restrictions , we know that on families of nested compact sets the field - particle system converges exponentially fast to a stationary state which is a bound state if the conserved @xmath493 initially and the static state if @xmath494 , superposed on which in either case is an outgoing field of electromagnetic radiation .",

    "however , we do conjecture that this will be the case . assuming this to be true",
    "we were able to show that for large times the evolution of the electromagnetic field satisfies the scattering formulas @xmath500 and @xmath501 where now @xmath502 and @xmath503 are generally _ not the same _ stationary bound state ; however , they differ by at most a space rotation , and this once again illustrates the soliton dynamics of the renormalized particle .    in both situations ,",
    "the explicit characterization of the scattering operator from the `` in '' states to the `` out '' states has not yet been worked out .",
    "scattering with a moving particle can mean any scattering process in which the particle moves for at least a finite interval of time . in that case we need to work with a nonstandard foliation , as explained in the section on the cauchy problem for the state .",
    "needless to say , so far this is the least explored case . the explicit characterization of the scattering states , and of the scattering operator from the `` in '' states to the `` out '' states still have to be worked out .",

    "furthermore , one can give the following partial characterization of the `` in '' and `` out '' states .",
    "in the situations ( a ) and the parts of ( b ) associated with a stationary bound state , the scattering asymptotics differs from the one discussed in the previous subsection by at most a translation of the stationary bound state .    in the situations ( c ) and the parts of ( b )",
    "not associated with a stationary bound state , the scattering asymptotics in the specified foliation is given as follows .",
    "as for the asymptotic particle motion , all the `` in '' states @xmath504 , as well as all the `` out '' states @xmath505 , are obtained from the stationary particle states considered above by the action of an element of the poincar group , more explicitly a combination of a translation , a rotation , and a lorentz boost .",

    "navely one would expect that generally the orientation _ and _ the norm of the angular velocity of the particle would change during the scattering process  and with it the rotational and renormalized mass of the particle , its spin and magnetic moment .",

    "however , it is of interest to inquire into the features expected for a renormalized dynamical limit of vanishing bare rest mass of massive led .",
    "first of all , the matching of empirical electron data in the dynamical renormalization problem with scattering states has to be carried out in the asymptotic past ( or future ) , for we want to `` send in '' the particle with the correct physical characteristic particle data .",

    ", @xmath157 will in general vary .",
    "however , our results on the scattering with a non - moving particle indicate that @xmath157 approaches its asymptotic value extremely fast . extrapolating from this observation",
    ", we expect that the soliton dynamics of the particle in massive led in fact will try to keep the angular frequency @xmath157 of the particle as close as possible to the asymptotic value in the free motions . by the same token",
    "the gyrational mass ( hence , also the renormalized mass , which is a small perturbation of the former in the stationary state ) of the particle should remain ( in the instantaneous rest frame ) very close to the empirical mass during the motion .",
    "an important conclusion can then be drawn if one can show that the gyrational bare mass of the particle with @xmath408 stays _ uniformly close _ to the empirical mass as @xmath457 for an @xmath456-indexed sequence of motions .",
    "namely , in that case the equatorial gyration speed of the renormalized purely electromagnetic particle must be locked at the speed of light during the whole motion ! for assuming to the contrary that the gyrational speed would remain bounded away from the speed of light for at least a finite fraction of the evolution ( of course still close to it in the uniform sense stipulated ) , it would then follow that the bare gyrational mass converges to zero , while the electromagnetic mass would contribute at best an amount of order @xmath6 of the empirical mass .",
    "this is in contradiction to its hypothesized uniform proximity to the empirical mass .",
    "we infer that in the limit @xmath457 the bare gyrational mass @xmath411 is independent of @xmath487 , hence a _ constant of the motion _ identical to what we have called the photonic mass of the stationary particle ; explicitly , @xmath624 by the same reasoning , in the limit of vanishing bare rest mass the bare spin vector becomes the _",

    "on the other hand , the point mass limit eliminates the moment of inertia of the bare particle while the norm of @xmath130 remains bounded ( by hypothesis ) so that @xmath782 identically ; whence , the gyrograph equation  ( [ eq : ggeq ] ) degenerates into the statement @xmath783 , i.e. , upon using ( [ eq : minkaltorque ] ) , @xmath784 these are the equations of the massive led of nodvik  @xcite .",
    "we will now explain that this is a qualitatively quite different dynamical theory from our massive led .",
    "first of all , since one loses a proper - time derivative for @xmath130 by passing from ( [ eq : ggeq ] ) to ( [ eq : ggeqnodvik ] ) , the point mass limit is a _ singular limit _ from the dynamical perspective of the cauchy problem for @xmath130 .",
    "this fact in itself already means that it will no longer be possible to arbitrarily choose initial data for @xmath130 from the set of admissible cauchy data for ( [ eq : ggeq ] ) . indeed , choose ( which we always may ) a lorentz frame in which initially ( i.e. at @xmath785 ) we have @xmath786 and @xmath787 , and pick the fields @xmath305 on @xmath788 at random from our set of admissible cauchy data for @xmath305 .",
    "then ( [ eq : ggeqnodvik ] ) at @xmath789 has only a nontrivial space part , which in three - space notation reads @xmath790 where @xmath791 is the space part of the dual four - vector for @xmath311 , and where @xmath792 is the initial electric torque on the particle and @xmath793 its initial ` magnetic spin . ' clearly , any attempt to also prescribe cauchy data for the angular velocity tensor @xmath311 , chosen at random from our set of admissible data , will almost surely violate ( [ eq : initconstraint ] ) .",
    "more specifically , ( [ eq : initconstraint ] ) , with ( [ eq : etorque ] ) and ( [ eq : bspin ] ) , imposes not just on the set of admissible initial data for @xmath130 but also on the fields @xmath305 , in the sense that for most choices of @xmath305 _ no _ choice for @xmath311 will satisfy ( [ eq : initconstraint ] ) .",
    "thus , one extracts directly from ( [ eq : initconstraint ] ) , ( [ eq : etorque ] ) , ( [ eq : bspin ] ) that the originally admissible field data are now further restricted as follows : either @xmath316 satisfies @xmath794 , and in this case also @xmath795 has to satisfy @xmath796 ; or @xmath316 satisfies @xmath797 , in which case @xmath795 has to satisfy @xmath798 . only if these alternate constraints on the initial fields are satisfied is it possible to satisfy ( [ eq : initconstraint ] ) by a compatible class of initial data @xmath311 ( viz . , @xmath791 ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath794 and @xmath799 , then the admissible data for @xmath791 are the same as for our model .",
    "if @xmath797 and @xmath800 , however , then @xmath791 has to be of the form @xmath801 which leaves only one degree of freedom to choose from instead of three , i.e. the coefficient @xmath6 in front of @xmath802 is at our disposal .",
    "this clarifies to which extent initial data for nodvik s model have to be compatible .",
    "compatibility of a set of initial data in the sense just explained does not , however , imply that all is well then , for not only has one lost a proper - time derivative on @xmath130 by passing from ( [ eq : ggeq ] ) to ( [ eq : ggeqnodvik ] ) , a proper - time derivative of @xmath130 does not show any more at all in ( [ eq : ggeqnodvik ] ) .",
    "nodvik s ( [ eq : ggeqnodvik ] ) is therefore not an orderly evolution equation for @xmath130 , but rather a _ constraint _",
    "equation for the dynamical field variables @xmath172 and the dynamical particle variables @xmath160 and @xmath170 , which in case of actually being satisfied by these variables for some time interval after the initial instant , still leaves a certain amount of freedom for choosing the value of the now purely kinematical variable @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , to the extent that compatible initial data for @xmath172 , @xmath160 , and @xmath170 , with a compatible initial choice of @xmath130 , can be continued at all according to nodvik s equations , such a continuation is presumably not unique .",
    "ever since dirac s surmise  @xcite that , as long as we are willing to let the bare mass take the value @xmath803 to compensate for the @xmath804 electromagnetic self - energies , we may view the abraham  lorentz  dirac ( ald ) equation @xmath805 as the _ exact _ equation for the radiation reaction - corrected motion of a spinless point particle with empirical electron mass @xmath540 and empirical electron charge @xmath539 in external electromagnetic fields @xmath806 , there has been a strong interest in making sense out of the peculiar third - order proper - time derivative of @xmath160 that figures in ( [ eq : aldeq ] ) , e.g.  @xcite . a rigorous clarification of dirac s surmise is , however , not so easy to come by .",
    "notable rigorous attempts to construct a consistent renormalized electrodynamics with spinless point charges are @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for work on the classical pauli  fierz model , a semi - relativistic dipole approximation to the problem , which also serves as point of departure for setting up a so - called non - relativistic qed  @xcite .    naturally one may wonder whether ( [ eq : aldeq ] ) emerges in some spinless point particle limit of our massive led , or to begin simpler , in the point particle limit of a spinless version of our massive led . this massive led without spin obtains from our model by simply discarding ( [ eq : ggeq ] ) and setting @xmath423 in the remaining equations .",
    "thus , the relativistic maxwell  lorentz equations are once again @xmath807 for the hodge dual of @xmath172 , and @xmath808 for @xmath172 itself , but now with @xmath809 the world - line equation still reads @xmath810 but now with @xmath811 and with @xmath812 given in ( [ eq : ueqsl ] ) . notice that the structure of @xmath145 does not figure in this spinless led , which is therefore identical to the spinless version of nodvik s led , due to spohn  @xcite , in which @xmath145 is a point mass distribution from the outset .",
    "the question then is : what happens if we let @xmath181 tend to a delta function concentrated at the same point ?",
    "the first step to the answer is the rigorous control of this spinless massive led which , however , is not very developed yet .      in this appendix",
    "we give a brief summary of semi - relativistic led .",
    "this material can also be used as a primer for the relativistic theory .",
    "we begin with the massive model with spin .",

    "<S> lorentz objection to the uhlenbeck - goudsmit proposal of a spin magnetic moment of the electron , namely that the electron s equatorial rotation speed would exceed the speed of light by a factor @xmath0 , mutated into an objection against lorentz electrodynamics ( led ) itself when the spin magnetic moment became established . </S>",
    "<S> however , lorentz renormalization calculation , based on the early @xmath1 century s notion of a purely electromagnetic electron , does not qualify as proper from a modern perspective . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shows that renormalization treated properly does lead to a mathematically consistent and physically viable led . a new , relativistically covariant massive led </S>",
    "<S> is presented in which the bare particle has a finite positive bare rest mass and moment of inertia . </S>",
    "<S> the particle s electromagnetic self - interaction renormalizes its mass and spin . </S>",
    "<S> most crucially , the renormalized particle is a _ soliton _ : after any scattering process its rest mass and spin magnitude are dynamically restored to their pre - scattering values . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees that `` an electron remains an electron , '' poetically speaking . a renormalization flow study of the limit of vanishing bare rest mass is conducted for this model . </S>",
    "<S> this limit yields a purely electromagnetic classical field theory with ultra - violet cutoff at about the electron s compton wavelength ! the renormalized limit model matches the empirical electron data as orderly as one can hope for at the level of lorentz theory . </S>",
