    "a linear sigma model with both quark - antiquark type fields and fields containing ( in an unspecified configuration ) two quarks and two antiquarks , seems useful for understanding the light scalar spectrum of qcd . in a previous treatment @xcite we considered a usual simplification in which the three light quark masses were taken to be zero .",
    "the model was seen to give a neat intuitive explanation of how  four quark \" scalar states could be naturally much lighter than the conventional p - wave quark - antiquark scalars .",
    "we also verified in detail that , as long as the potential of the model satisfied su(3)@xmath0 @xmath1 su(3)@xmath2 invariance , the massless version of the famous current algebra theorem @xcite on low energy pion pion scattering was correct .    in the present paper we introduce a common mass for the three light quarks in such a way that the pion gets its correct mass .",
    "su(3 ) flavor invariance continues to hold , which is a desirable simplification .",
    "first we reexamine the masses and mixings of the particles in the model .",
    "it is seen that the natural explanation for the lightness of a  four quark \" scalar remains unchanged .",
    "then we reexamine the pion pion scattering amplitude to try to see if the low energy theorem continues to hold .",
    "curiously we find that it does not exactly hold .",
    "what goes wrong ?",
    "the algebra of the noether currents should be good in this model so that is not the cause .",
    "it turns out that the partially conserved axial vector current , which is also required for the theorem , does not hold , unlike for the massless case .",
    "the axial vector current has a single particle contribution from the  heavy pion \" in this chiral model as well as from the ordinary pion .",
    "the ordinary pion does not therefore completely saturate the axial current .",
    "actually this is a small effect but is of conceptual interest and may be of more importance for the kaon scattering case .",
    "a more important quantitative effect arises from the contributions of the scalar isosinglet mesons in the model .",
    "it is shown that these contributions can explain the experimental s wave isosinglet scattering length .",
    "the notation is reviewed in section ii .",
    "the corrections to the masses and mixings , due to the quark mass term , are studied in section iii .",
    "an approximate analytic treatment of the scattering , for a general potential , is contained in section iv . the exact numerical treatment for a",
    " leading order \" potential is presented in section v. some discussion and conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "the appendix explains the method of parameter determination from experiment and a listing of typical values for all the parameters .",
    "we introduce the 3@xmath13 matrix chiral nonet fields ; @xmath3 here @xmath4 represents scalar , @xmath5 and pseudoscalar , @xmath6 quark - antiquark type states , while @xmath7 represents states which are made of two quarks and two antiquarks .",

    "the general lagrangian density which defines our model is @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for a function made from su(3)@xmath17 su(3)@xmath2 ( but not necessarily u(1)@xmath10 ) invariants formed out of @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 stands for chiral symmetry breaking terms which transform in the same way as the quark mass terms in the fundamental qcd lagrangian . in our previous paper @xcite , we focused on general properties which continued to hold when @xmath18 was set to zero . here , we include the su(3 ) symmetric mass term : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a real parameter .",
    "a characteristic feature of the model is the presence of `` two - quark '' and `` four - quark '' condensates : @xmath21 we shall assume the vacuum to be su(3)@xmath22 invariant , which implies @xmath23 the su(3 ) particle content of the model consists of two pseudoscalar octets , two pseudoscalar singlets , two scalar octets and two scalar singlets .",
    "this gives us eight different masses and four mixing angles .",
    "we next give the notations for resolving the nonets into su(3 ) octets and singlets .",
    "note the matrix convention @xmath24 .",
    "the properly normalized singlet states are : @xmath25 then we have the matrix decompositions : @xmath26 wherein @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are all 3 @xmath31 3 traceless matrices .",
    "the singlet scalar fields may be further decomposed as : @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fluctuation fields around the true ground state of the model .",
    "the breaking of su(3 ) to the isospin group su(2 ) will be examined in the future . in that case",
    "there are 16 different masses , four 2@xmath12 mixing matrices and two 4@xmath14 mixing matrices . to fully characterize the system we will also require some knowledge of the axial vector and vector currents obtained by noether s method : @xmath35 where the dots stand for terms bilinear in the fields .",
    "in our model we use a previously discussed scheme to select the most important terms in the potential , @xmath36 .",

    "information about the pseudoscalar particles which is independent of the choice of the u(1)@xmath10 invariant terms in @xmath42 may be obtained by differentiating the following matrix equation representing the response of the potential to an infinitesimal axial transformation : @xmath43_+ - \\left[s,\\frac{\\partial v_0}{\\partial \\phi}\\right]_+ + ( \\phi , s)\\rightarrow(\\phi',s ' ) = 1\\left [ 2\\ , { \\rm tr } \\left(\\phi'\\frac{\\partial v_0}{\\partial s'}- s'\\frac{\\partial v_0}{\\partial \\phi'}\\right ) - 8\\,c_3\\ , i\\ ,   f_\\eta(m , m')\\right ] .",

    "the minimum equations for this potential are : @xmath47    @xmath48    differentiating the potential in eq.([speclag ] ) twice will yield four 2@xmath12 mass matrices denoted as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively for the pseudoscalar octets , the pseudoscalar singlets , the scalar octets and the scalar singlets .",
    "these may be brought to diagonal ( hatted ) form by the following 2@xmath12 orthogonal transformations : @xmath53 notice that the four mass matrices are identical to those given in section iv of @xcite for the zero quark mass case .",
    "the numerical values of the entries will however differ because the relations among the coefficients are different due to the presence of 2a rather than zero on the right hand side of eq.([mealpha ] ) .",
    "in the massive case there are 9 parameters ( a , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath39 and @xmath41 ) .",

    "this determination is a generalization of the one in the previous zero mass pion case in which four parameters were determined from four inputs .",
    "the effects of adding a non zero quark mass term on the masses of the two predicted scalar singlets are displayed in fig.[ms0vsmpip ] .",
    "it is clear that the small mass term has a negligible effect on the mass of the heavier scalar singlet . on the other hand",

    "we have seen that there are not very big changes when using an su(3 ) symmetric quark mass term of proper strength to give the experimental mass value to the pion .",
    "however , for the discussion of the pion pion scattering amplitude near threshold , which is one of the most important applications of the chiral approach , the correct value of the pion mass is important . in the zero quark mass case we showed that for any choice of terms in the potential v@xmath67 , the current algebra expression for the threshold pion pion amplitude held exactly",

    "the correction to the current algebra result for @xmath138 due to the finite masses of light scalars was already discussed and noted to be positive in @xcite , some years ago .",
    "the contribution of a light scalar meson to the scattering length was recently calculated in @xcite .",

    "the typical values obtained for the mass and width of the lightest scalar are m = 441 mev and @xmath144 = 544 mev .",
    "these are also similar to what is obtained @xcite , m = 457 mev and @xmath144 = 632 mev , by using a k - matrix unitarized three flavor linear sigma model ( with just one chiral nonet ) .",
    "a unitarized two flavor linear sigma model was earlier given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath100 wave pion pion interaction has recently @xcite been discussed using the adler sum rule .",

    "= 7.5 cm     = 7.5 cm     the encouraging result for @xmath138 with inclusion of scalar meson corrections corresponds to a tree level treatment of this linear sigma model .",
    "one may justifiably wonder whether the agreement would be spoiled by inclusion of loops , i.e. by a unitarization of the model . while this is a more complicated matter we may note that the simplest unitarization , the k matrix approach , does not change the result at all . in this approach the corrected scattering length would be ,    @xmath145    where the kinematical square root is to be evaluated at threshold , @xmath146 .",
    "of course this is just an indication rather than a proof that the effect of unitarization is expected to be small for the scattering lengths .",
    "we have seen that the intuitive explanation for the existence of a very light scalar meson as well as light scalar mesons with large  four quark \" content given in @xcite ( which used the simplifying assumption of zero pion mass ) still is good when the physical pion mass is used .",
    "the main physical input is ( almost ) spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "our model treats the chiral symmetry in its linear realization .",
    "this is normally considered inconvenient for the treatment of the scattering problem since it is known that there are very large cancellations between the four pion contact and scalar meson pole terms due to the symmetry .",

    "the contribution from the lightest scalar @xmath148 exchange , using this starting equation , has a very small magnitude , although its effect is expected to be the largest .",
    "evidently , the intricate cancellations completely distort the underlying physics when expressed in this form . on the other hand",

    "the correction to the current algebra result is seen to be completely dominated by the lightest scalar .",

    "it does not seem to matter which one is chosen for this aspect .",
    "the virtue of the present toy model is that it accomodates both 2 quark and 4 quark scalar nonets in a consistent way and may help in understanding the relation to qcd as earlier discussed @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of this linear formulation is the presence of heavy , largely four quark pseudoscalars , of which the @xmath62 is a possible candidate .",
    "an amusing feature of the present model with a massive pion is that , due to a small deviation from exact pcac , the current algebra result for near threshold pion pion scattering no longer holds exactly .",
    "associated with this is the feature that the amplitude no longer vanishes at the unphysical point ( adler zero ) , @xmath117 .",
    "the zero is shifted somewhat .",
    "the measure of this effect is the deviation of the coefficient , @xmath82 from zero .",
    "we have seen that this is quite small since @xmath82 is of the order @xmath149 0.01 , as may be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 2fs ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the similar effect should be more noticeable for the @xmath150 system and for @xmath151 scattering .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that this system is formally analogous to the @xmath152 system with the substitutions @xmath153 and @xmath154 . but in this case @xmath155 is expected to be of the order @xmath156 0.1 , ten times greater than for the pion case .",
