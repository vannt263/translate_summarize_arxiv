    "<S> motivated by very recent studies of coulomb drag in grahene - bn - graphene system we develop a theory of coulomb drag for the fermi liquid regime , for the case when the ratio of spacer thickness @xmath0 to the fermi wavelength of electrons is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration ( @xmath1 ) and thickness dependence of the drag resistivity is changed from @xmath2 for the thick spacer to @xmath3 for the thin one .    </S>",
    "<S> coulomb drag in bilayer semiconductor systems is a very interesting phenomenon providing a unique information about many - body effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the role of electron - electron interactions in graphene , a novel two - dimensional material with extraordinary electronic and structural properties @xcite , is a controversial issue now ( for review , see ref . ) </S>",
    "<S> study of the coulomb drag in graphene is important , as a way to clarify the situation .    </S>",
    "<S> first theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of the coulomb drag in graphene have been performed already . </S>",
    "<S> theory @xcite deals with the case of thick spacer ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fermi wave vector of graphene and @xmath0 is the spacer thickness ) , and the results are in a good agreement with the corresponding experimental data @xcite ( the effects of trigonal warping @xcite seem to be negligible ) . very recently </S>",
    "<S> , the group of a. geim and k. novoselov has performed experiments with graphene on a substrate of bn , using also bn as a spacer between two graphene single layers , and observed the drag for much thinner spacers @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> i present a theory generalizing that of ref . for arbitrary values of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the general expression for the drag conductivity @xcite based on the lowest - order perturbation theory in interlayer coulomb interaction ( we consider only the case of identical layers 1 and 2 , qualitatively all the basic physics remains the same for the case of different doping of two layers ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the nonlinear susceptibility of electrons in the layer , @xmath9 is their fermi energy , @xmath10 is the temperature , @xmath11 is the fourier component of the screened interlayer coulomb interaction which reads , for the case of identical layers : @xmath12 ^2-\\left [ u_c\\left ( q\\right ) \\pi \\left ( q,\\omega \\right ) \\right ] ^2 } , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fourier components of bare coulomb interactions within the layer and between the layers , respectively , @xmath15 is the polarization operator of the electron gas in graphene . in vacuum , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the expression ( [ eq2 ] ) coincides with eq.(a2 ) from ref ..    since typical frequencies contributing to the integral in eq.([eq1 ] ) is of the order of @xmath18 one can assume , for low enough temperatures , that the screening is static and replace @xmath19 by @xmath20 .    in the ballistic regime ( which means that the distance between the layers @xmath0 is much smaller than the mean - free path within the layer @xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> one can calculate for the case of graphene @xcite @xmath22 at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean - free path time and @xmath25 m / s is the fermi velocity .    assuming that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inlayer conductivity the drag resistivity is @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> drude formula for the case of graphene is @xmath29 thus , the drag resistivity does not depend on @xmath30 .    as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the drag resistivity for the case of identical graphene layers takes the form @xmath31 the quantity @xmath11 in eq.([eq3 ] ) is given by the expression ( [ eq2 ] ) with the static polarization operator for graphene ( see , e.g. , refs . )    @xmath32 , & q>2k_f \\end{array } \\right .    </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    to find @xmath13 and @xmath14 one needs to solve the electrostatic problem taking into account different screening by substrate , spacer , and air . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the dielectric medium is three - layer , with the dielectric constant distribution @xmath33 the calculations are quite standard ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the reader s convenience we present them here with some details .    </S>",
    "<S> we have to solve the poisson equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electrostatic potential created by the point charge @xmath36 situated at @xmath37 the only allowed solution at @xmath38 is @xmath39 and at @xmath40 is @xmath41 for @xmath42 it should be tried in the most general form : @xmath43 from continuity of the potential and the normal component of electric induction , @xmath44 at the boundaries @xmath45 and @xmath46 we find , taking into account eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p2 ] ) and ( [ p3 ] ) : @xmath47 @xmath48 where prime means the derivative with respect to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath35 is continuous at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) but its derivative has a jump . due to eqs . </S>",

    "<S> 1 . this result seems to be in a qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite , at least , it gives the correct order of magnitude for the drag resistivity . at the same time , for small enough @xmath6 and @xmath79 the interlayer coulomb interaction is in general not small , and it is not clear whether the lowest - order perturbation theory used here will be also quantitatively accurate or taking into account next - order contributions will be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the issue requires further studies , both experimental and theoretical .    recently two more works on the subject appeared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this paper and the other two papers concerning concentration dependence of the drag resistivity are in an agreement , namely , in ref . the same analytical concentration dependence as here , @xmath80 , was obtained for the case of thin spacer whereas in ref . </S>",
