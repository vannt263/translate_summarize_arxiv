    "<S> a key step in the proof of these results is a multi - step state - dependent version of foster s criterion introduced in @xcite for countable state space models , later extended to general state space models in meyn and tweedie ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of @xcite only established positive recurrence . </S>",
    "<S> moments and rates of convergence to stationarity of the markovian network model were obtained in @xcite , based on an extension of @xcite using the subgeometric @xmath16-ergodic theorem in @xcite [ recently extended and simplified in work of @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> converse theorems have appeared in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that show that , under rather strong conditions , instability of the fluid model implies transience of the stochastic network . </S>",
    "<S> the counterexamples in @xcite , @xcite show that some additional conditions are necessary to obtain a converse .    under general conditions , including the generalized skip - free assumption , </S>",
    "<S> a fluid limit @xmath17 is a _ weak _ solution ( in a sense given below ) to the homogeneous ode @xmath18 the vector field @xmath19 is defined as a radial limit of the function @xmath20 appearing in under appropriate renormalization .    </S>",
    "<S> provided that the increments @xmath21 in the decomposition are tight in @xmath22 , stability of the fluid limit model implies finite moments in steady state , as well as polynomial rates of convergence to stationarity ; see theorem [ theo:(f , r)-ergodicity ] .    one advantage of the ode approach over the usual foster  </S>",
    "<S> lyapunov approach to stability is that the ode model provides insight into markov chain dynamics . in the queueing context , the ode model has many other applications , such as simulation variance reduction [ @xcite ] and optimization [ @xcite ] .    </S>",

    "<S> section [ subsec : fluid limit : definitions ] contains notation and assumptions , along with a construction of the fluid limit model . the main result is contained in section [ subsec : stability of fluid limits and markov chain stability ] , where it is shown that stability of the fluid limit model implies the existence of polynomial moments as well as polynomial rates of convergence to stationarity [ known as @xmath23-_ergodicity _ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> fluid limits are characterized in section [ subsec : characterization of the fluid limits ] . </S>",
    "<S> proposition  [ prop : characterization - fluid - limit ] provides conditions that guarantee that a fluid limit coincides with the weak solutions of the ode .    </S>",
    "<S> these results are applied to establish @xmath23-ergodicity of the random walk metropolis  </S>",

    "<S> example : mixture of gaussian densities ] and [ example : mixture - weibulian ] , the fluid limit model is stable and any fluid limit is a weak solution of the ode , yet some fluid limits are nondeterministic .    </S>",
