    "the mode - coupling theory @xcite has been used extensively to describe the slow relaxation observed in supercooled liquids close to the glass transition .",

    "they used the structure factors determined from the simulations as the input to the mode - coupling theory , and found that the transition temperature predicted by the theory was approximately twice higher than the transition temperature inferred from simulations .",
    "however , the non - ergodicity parameters predicted by the theory agreed reasonably well with the ones determined from simulations . in a later work , kob , nauroth , and sciortino @xcite",
    "quantitatively compared the shape of the intermediate scattering functions predicted by the mode - coupling theory to results of newtonian dynamics simulations . since the transition temperature predicted by the theory is greater than that inferred from simulations , the intermediate scattering functions at the same temperature ( and close to the transition temperature ) are vastly different .",
    "therefore , the authors compared scattering functions predicted by the theory at a higher temperature to scattering functions obtained from simulations at a lower temperature .",
    "the two corresponding temperatures were determined by the requirement that the relaxation time be the same for one wave vector around the first peak in partial structure factor for the larger particles .",

    "they found that , if the time scale is rescaled , the mode - coupling theory accurately predicts the shape of the intermediate scattering functions in the @xmath3 relaxation region .",
    "recently , the mode - coupling theory has been compared to molecular and brownian dynamics simulations of polydisperse spheres with a strong repulsive core by voigtmann , puertes , and fuchs @xcite .",
    "they used the percus - yevick theory to determine the structure factors for the mode - coupling theory calculations . for the comparison of the theory with simulation",
    ", they adjusted the packing fraction and allowed a `` dynamical '' length scale to vary slightly .",
    "they found that after these adjustments the intermediate scattering functions and the mean square displacement predicted by the mode - coupling theory agreed well with the simulation results .",
    "the goal of the work presented here is to compare the predictions of the mode coupling theory to the results of brownian dynamics simulations using the smallest possible number of adjustable parameters .",
    "in other words , we would like to test the predictive power of the mode - coupling theory rather than demonstrate that by making a number of parameters adjustable , we can reproduce the simulation results very accurately . in view of the difference between the mode - coupling transition temperature predicted by the theory and inferred from simulations ,",
    "a minimalistic approach is to compare theoretical predictions and results of the simulations at the same reduced temperature @xmath4 .",
    "briefly , the result of our comparison is that many time dependent quantities predicted by the theory agree reasonably well with results of the simulations if @xmath2 is not too small .",
    "however , there is significant disagreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results for the non - gaussian parameter for all but the highest reduced temperatures . finally , at low reduced temperatures there is a hopping - like motion present in the simulations which is not predicted by the mode - coupling theory .",
    "one of the reasons for testing the mode coupling theory against brownian dynamics simulations is that the approximations involved in this theory applied to brownian systems are somewhat less severe .",
    "the first approximation of the theory , projecting stress fluctuations onto the subspace of the density products @xcite , is exact for brownian systems .",
    "however , the main and the most drastic approximation of the mode coupling theory , the self - consistent factorization approximation , has to still be used .",

    "it should be noted that this temperature is sensitive to the range of temperatures used in the power law fits @xcite . while the transition temperatures are vastly different , we find that the mode - coupling theory gives good quantitative results of many time dependent quantities if they are compared at the same reduced temperature @xmath1 .",

    "the non - gaussian parameter calculated from the simulations are quite different than the non - gaussian parameter predicted by the mode - coupling theory .",
