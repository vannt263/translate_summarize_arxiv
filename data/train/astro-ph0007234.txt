    "the discovery of kilohertz quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) from many neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) has given us a sensitive probe of the conditions near accreting neutron stars ( see van der klis 1998 for a review of the properties of kilohertz qpos ) .",
    "a variety of models have been suggested for this phenomenon , including beat - frequency models ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) , relativistic precession models ( stella & vietri 1998 ) , and disk oscillation models ( e.g. , osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ) .    in any such model , the brightness oscillations can be produced in two general ways . in a pure _ luminosity",
    "_ oscillation , the total luminosity of the source changes quasi - periodically but the angular distribution of the radiation remains fixed . in",
    "a pure _ beaming _ oscillation , the total luminosity remains constant but the angular distribution of the radiation changes and hence the flux in the direction of the observer is modulated .",
    "an example of a luminosity oscillation is the beat - frequency oscillation in the magnetospheric beat - frequency model proposed for the so - called horizontal branch oscillation seen from z sources ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; shibazaki & lamb 1987 ) .",
    "an example of a beaming oscillation is the modulation created by an accretion - powered pulsar , in which , as the neutron star rotates , the hot spots on the magnetic polar cap pass into and out of our view , creating an observed modulation .    here",
    "we focus on beaming oscillations . in some models of the kilohertz qpos ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , the qpo peak with the highest frequency in a given source is a beaming oscillation caused by the movement of bright arcs of impact around the star , at the orbital frequencies in a special range of radii in the accretion disk . only the fundamental for such an oscillation has been observed , and the amplitudes at any overtones are down by at least factors of several .",
    "moreover , in no kilohertz qpo source has there been a strong brightness oscillation observed at the putative stellar spin frequency during the persistent emission between type 1 x - ray bursts ( kilohertz qpos have not been observed from the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax  j1808 - 3658 ; see wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) . for some of the higher - luminosity sources , such as sco  x-1 , the upper limit on the pulsed fraction is as low as 0.3% ( vaughan et al .",
    "this constrains beat frequency models , in which the lower - frequency qpo peak is created in part by a modulation at the spin frequency .",
    "it is therefore necessary to explain how the spin modulation can be important close to the star but undetectable by current instruments at infinity .    to understand this",
    ", we need to consider various ways in which beaming oscillations can be attenuated on their way to us .",
    "two general effects are ( 1 )  integration over the visible surface of the star , which tends to smooth out variations in intensity , and ( 2 )  scattering in a surrounding hot central corona , whose existence has been inferred from previously existing spectral and temporal modeling of neutron - star lmxbs ( lamb 1989 ; miller & lamb 1992 ; psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ; psaltis & lamb 1997 ) .",
    "previous treatments of the attenuation of beaming oscillations by scattering ( brainerd & lamb 1987 ; kylafis & phinney 1989 ) assumed for simplicity that the source of radiation was a pencil beam at the center of a scattering cloud with uniform electron density ( although see wang & schlickeiser 1987 for a discussion of offset emission and varying electron density in the diffusion approximation ) , and have implicitly assumed that photons follow straight - line trajectories ( although for a treatment of general relativistic light - bending without scattering , see wood , ftaclas , & kearney 1988 ; mszros , riffert , & berthiaume 1988 ) . with the large amounts of data available from the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , it is now important to examine some of the deviations expected from this idealization .",
    "here we calculate the attenuation of beaming oscillations near neutron stars , taking into account the finite size of the star , the varying electron number density near the star , and general relativistic light deflection . in ",
    "2 we explain our numerical method . in   3",
    "we discuss the decrease in the modulation amplitude of beaming oscillations caused by integration over the visible surface of the star . in   4 we treat several aspects of the attenuation of beaming oscillations by scattering , including the presence of a finite object , varying electron number density , modulation from multiple harmonics of emission , the angular dependence of the specific intensity , and general relativistic light deflection . in   5 we calculate the modulation amplitude close to the star , within the scattering cloud . in   6 we summarize and give our conclusions .",
    "the numerical results in this paper are generated using a monte carlo code .",
    "we assume that a star of radius @xmath0 is in the center of a scattering cloud .",
    "we also define optical depths @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that if the locally measured electron number density were uniform then , if the star were not present , the optical depth from the center of the sphere to the radius of the star would be @xmath1 , and the optical depth from the center to the outer boundary of the scattering sphere would be @xmath2 .",
    "photons are introduced into the sphere at some radius and angle , traveling in some given direction , and they are followed individually as they scatter in the sphere . when the photons escape , their direction is stored .",
    "after all the photons ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 , depending on the run ) have been tracked , rms amplitudes or beaming ratios can be computed .",
    "we now discuss how photon paths between scatterings and after escape are followed for straight - line propagation and light deflection .",
    "the number @xmath5 of mean free paths traversed between two scatterings is selected randomly according to @xmath6 .",
    "if the scattering cloud has a uniform density then the physical distance traveled is proportional to @xmath5 , otherwise the distance must be calculated from the density distribution .",
    "once the distance between two given scatterings is ascertained , the code checks whether ( 1 )  the photon hits the star , or ( 2 )  the photon escapes .",
    "if the photon escapes , the current direction of propagation of the photon is stored .",
    "if the photon hits the star , then in the next iteration the photon is assumed to be emitted in an outward direction from the point of impact , selected from an isotropic distribution .",
    "otherwise , the new location is calculated by adding the vector of the photon path to the previous position .      when light deflection is included , the propagation of photons is slightly more complicated than it is if photons propagate in straight lines .",
    "although light deflection occurs in newtonian gravity as well as in general relativity , light deflection is only important when gravity is strong enough to make general relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity significant .",
    "hence , we consider an external spacetime that is the schwarzschild spacetime , which is appropriate outside spherically symmetric , nonrotating neutron stars .",
    "this spacetime includes most of the important features of , e.g. , light deflection around neutron stars , and the results are easier to evaluate than the results of scattering around rotating neutron stars .    in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    ", any geodesic can be treated as an equatorial geodesic by an appropriate rotation of the coordinate system ( a statement that is not true for general spacetimes with rotation ) .",
    "this feature means that a simple way to treat photon propagation between scatters is to follow the path in that temporary  equatorial plane \" and then rotate back into the global coordinate system .",
    "hence , there are three new tasks brought up by the inclusion of light deflection : ( 1 )  calculation of temporary equatorial planes , ( 2 )  computation of the curved trajectory of the photon in that plane , and ( 3 )  determination of the additional curvature of the photon trajectory after it escapes from the scattering cloud .",
    "we now treat these in order .",
    "let the current angular location of the photon have a colatitude @xmath7 and an azimuthal angle @xmath8 in the global coordinate system .",
    "we represent the unit vector in this direction by @xmath9 , which in cartesian coordinates is as usual the three - vector @xmath10 , where the first , second , and third components are along the global @xmath5 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 directions , respectively .",
    "let the initial direction of propagation of the photon , also in the global coordinate system , be @xmath13 .",
    "we set up the new equatorial plane as follows .",
    "the @xmath14-axis is in the direction @xmath9 , and since this is properly normalized we assign @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath16 axis is perpendicular to the plane containing @xmath9 and @xmath13 , and is thus in the direction @xmath17 .",
    "the remaining axis is in the direction @xmath18",
    ". if the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath13 is @xmath19 , then the unit vectors are @xmath20\\\\ { \\hat z}={1\\over{\\sin\\psi}}(\\theta,\\phi)\\times(\\alpha,\\beta)\\ ; , \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] and the equatorial plane is defined by @xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus , if we use @xmath22 to denote the azimuthal angle in this new equatorial plane [ where @xmath23 at the original angular location @xmath9 ] , then the location in the original , global cartesian coordinates at an arbitrary radius @xmath25 and angle @xmath22 is just @xmath26 .",
    "the next task is to follow the propagation of a photon in this new equatorial plane between scatterings . to do this",
    ", we note that the locally measured spacelike components of the photon four - velocity are just @xmath27 here we use geometrized units in which @xmath28 . in this and",
    "subsequent equations , hatted quantities such as @xmath29 are measured in a local tetrad , in contrast to unhatted quantities such as @xmath30 , which are measured in the global boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "the components of the four - velocity in global boyer - lindquist coordinates are given by the transformation of these quantities from the local to global frames ( see , e.g. , abramowicz , ellis , & lanza 1993 ; miller & lamb 1996 ) : @xmath31 the photon path is followed by moving a small distance @xmath32 along the ray ( we found @xmath33 in units of the mean free path gives sufficient accuracy ) and recalculating the propagation angle @xmath19 : @xmath34 ( see , e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1993 or",
    "miller & lamb 1996 ) . using this formula",
    ", we can determine the total deflection @xmath22 and rotate back from the temporary equatorial plane to the global coordinate system .",
    "the last task is to follow the deflection of the photon after it has escaped .",
    "this is done straightforwardly using the approach of , e.g. , pechenick , ftaclas , & cohen ( 1983 ) . in this approach",
    ", we define the impact parameter @xmath35 , and let @xmath36 . the total deflection angle from radius @xmath25",
    "to infinity is ( pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , eq .",
    "[ 2.12 ] ) @xmath37^{-1/2}du\\ ; .\\ ] ] note that , as defined , this is actually the difference between the global azimuthal angle at infinity @xmath38 and the global azimuthal angle @xmath39 at @xmath25 .",
    "that is , even without general relativistic light deflection @xmath40 can be nonzero .",
    "for example , if @xmath41 ( so that the photon is emitted tangentially to the radial vector ) , then if @xmath42 then @xmath43 . after computing @xmath40 , the angular location in the global coordinate system can be calculated as before , by rotating from the temporary equatorial plane to the global system .",
    "the initial location and direction of propagation of the photons depend on the run .",
    "the default condition is that the photons start on the surface of the star and are beamed directly outward ( we will refer to this as a  pencil beam \" specific intensity ) .",
    "we will , however , consider other specific intensities , such as one that is isotropic outwards or one that has the slightly beamed pattern appropriate for radiation that was generated deep in the star and that propagated outward via isotropic scattering ( see chandrasekhar 1960 , chapter 3 ) .",
    "the individual scatters are assumed to be locally isotropic .",
    "note that we make a distinction between the angular width of the specific intensity and the angular pattern of emission on the star .",
    "the former is what an observer standing on the star would measure from a particular emitting point , whereas the latter is the variation in total intensity ( integrated over local angles ) as a function of position on the star .",
    "before treating the effects of scattering , we first note that a beaming pattern of high amplitude at the surface of the star may appear to an observer at infinity to have a low or zero amplitude .",
    "this could happen because the angular width of the specific intensity from radiating points on the stellar surface is nonzero , and thus an observer at infinity sees light from everywhere on the visible portion of the star .",
    "if the specific intensity has a wide beaming pattern ( e.g. , if the pattern is isotropic ) , then the intensity seen by the observer integrates over much of the star , and radiation patterns with large numbers of lobes are smeared out at infinity , leading to low amplitudes of intensity modulation as the star rotates .    in this section",
    "we derive expressions for the modulation amplitude seen at infinity , with no scattering , under various assumptions about the specific intensity and the angular pattern of emission on the star .",
    "we first treat the case of straight - line photon propagation , and show that for an isotropic specific intensity and an odd number @xmath44 of lobes in the stellar emission pattern the intensity seen at infinity is constant .",
    "thus , the relative modulation amplitude measured at infinity can be much less than the relative amplitude measured at the source even without light deflection .",
    "we then consider general relativistic light deflection .",
    "we confirm that , as demonstrated before ( e.g. , pechenick et al .",
    "1983 ) , light deflection has a tendency to decrease the modulation amplitude .",
    "however , we also show that for some harmonics of the stellar spin frequency , the modulation seen at infinity can actually have a _ higher _ amplitude when light deflection is included , compared to the modulation that would be observed if the photon trajectories were straight . in our treatments of both the straight and curved photon trajectories",
    ", we assume that the emission pattern on the star is a thin equatorial belt , with a half - thickness @xmath45 much less than @xmath0 .",
    "this is intended to model the intensity distribution expected in beat - frequency models of kilohertz qpos .",
    "assume that the specific intensity is isotropic outwards , and that the emission intensity at an azimuthal angle @xmath8 is @xmath46 here @xmath47 gives the @xmath47th harmonic ; @xmath48 is the fundamental , @xmath49 is the first overtone , and so on .",
    "the flux observed at infinity from a short segment of the equatorial belt is proportional to the product of the projected area of the segment ( which is proportional to the cosine of the angle @xmath50 between the line of sight and the surface normal ) and the emission intensity of the segment .",
    "let the observer be at an angle @xmath51 , and assume that the segment of interest is at the angle @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 , and thus emission is observed between @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the star rotates with angular frequency @xmath56 , then at a time @xmath57 the star is at a rotational phase @xmath58 and the observed intensity is @xmath59 \\cos\\phi\\,d\\phi\\\\ = \\sin\\theta\\left[2i_0+i_1{\\pi\\over 2}\\cos\\omega t+ \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty i_{2m}{2\\over{4m^2 - 1}}\\cos 2m\\omega t\\right]\\ ; . \\end{array}\\ ] ] hence , the modulation amplitude vanishes for odd - numbered harmonics other than the fundamental , and decreases as @xmath60 for the even harmonics .",
    "if the specific intensity is proportional to @xmath61 , then the variable part of the observed flux vanishes if @xmath62 is odd and @xmath63 , and is finite otherwise .",
    "thus , contingent on the angle dependence of the specific intensity , either odd or even harmonics can integrate to zero .",
    "when light deflection is included , the observer can see more of the star",
    ". a larger fraction of the emission is thus observed , and hence one might expect that the general tendency will be for light deflection to reduce the observed amplitude modulation . indeed , this is the case at , e.g. , the fundamental of the rotation frequency when the specific intensity is isotropic .",
    "however , since the constancy of the flux when @xmath63 and @xmath62 is odd comes from the vanishing of the integral when the limits are exactly @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the change of these limits by light deflection means that the amplitudes at these harmonics are actually _ larger _ when light deflection occurs than they would be in the limit of straight - line photon propagation .",
    "we show this effect in figure  1 , in which we plot the rms amplitude vs. @xmath66 for different numbers @xmath47 of lobes in the emission pattern ( i.e. , different harmonic numbers @xmath47 ) .",
    "shortly after low - frequency qpos were first discovered in neutron - star lmxbs ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 ; for a review see van der klis 1989 ) , a beat - frequency model was suggested for them in which the frequency of the qpo is equal to the difference between the stellar spin frequency and the frequency of a keplerian orbit near the main magnetospheric gas pickup radius ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; shibazaki & lamb 1987 ) .",
    "in such a model , one would also expect to see a peak in the power density spectrum at the stellar spin frequency itself , but no such peak was observed . an early qualitative idea ( lamb et al .",
    "1985 ; lamb 1986 ) , backed up by more quantitative calculations ( brainerd & lamb 1987 ; wang & schlickeiser 1987 ; kylafis & phinney 1989 ) , was that whereas the beat frequency oscillation is a luminosity oscillation and thus not easily attenuated , the brightness oscillation expected at the stellar spin frequency is a beaming oscillation and is thus relatively easily isotropized and attenuated by scattering through a hot central corona .",
    "the existence of such a scattering corona near the neutron stars in lmxbs has been inferred by detailed comparisons of spectral models with observations ( see , e.g. , psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "these model fits give radial optical depths to thomson scattering of @xmath67 and scattering corona radii of @xmath68  cm ( see miller et al .",
    "1998 ) . with such radii and optical depths",
    ", the beaming oscillation at the spin frequency is expected to be attenuated by a factor of several , which would lower the observed amplitudes to values consistent with current upper limits .",
    "now that rxte has observed a number of these sources and discovered high - frequency qpos , we are once again faced with the quantitative question of why the spin frequency or other harmonics of the kilohertz keplerian frequency are not observed in the power spectra from these lmxbs . due to the high quality of rxte data and the more stringent upper limits it provides , we need to consider a number of the effects that previous treatments neglected for simplicity .",
    "we do this in this section , where we consider ( 1 )  a beaming pattern that originates from the surface of a finite - sized neutron star instead of from the center of the scattering cloud , ( 2 )  a corona with a number density that changes with radius , ( 3 )  beaming patterns for different harmonics , ( 4 )  different specific intensity distributions , and ( 5 )  the effects of general relativistic light deflection .",
    "our most important results are that the finite size of the neutron star decreases the expected attenuation of a beaming oscillation as seen at infinity even if the corona is much larger than the star , and that for many emission geometries _ all _ overtones ( not just the even harmonics ) are attenuated far more than is the fundamental .      to follow the treatment of brainerd & lamb ( 1987 ) , consider a plane - parallel slab that goes from optical depth @xmath69 to @xmath2 , and assume that there is a source of intensity @xmath70 pointing forward ( towards @xmath71 ) at @xmath72 .",
    "if we solve this problem in the two - stream approximation , where @xmath73 is the forward intensity at @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the backward intensity at @xmath74 , the equations are    @xmath76    with the boundary conditions @xmath77 .    solving these equations , we find that @xmath78    a measure of the asymmetry of the emission is the beaming ratio    @xmath79    this confirms the result of wang & schlickeiser ( 1987 ) , who showed that in the diffusion approximation ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) the anisotropy of radiation depends approximately on the ratio @xmath82 .",
    "brainerd & lamb ( 1987 ) effectively considered the special case @xmath83 .",
    "note that the offset of the emission from the center of the scattering cloud multiplies the modulation amplitude seen at infinity by the constant factor @xmath84 , and does _ not _ asymptote to the @xmath83 amplitude even when @xmath85 .",
    "the results of the numerical calculation with a finite object are shown in table  1 , where both the star and the scattering cloud are assumed to be spherical . in this table ,",
    "@xmath3 photons were used for each calculation , and each one started out on the surface of the star at an optical depth @xmath1 from the center and was directed radially outward ( thus , this is a result for an initial pencil beam ) .",
    "the numbers are the ratios of forward to backward intensity , defined as the ratio of the emergent intensity through the northern hemisphere ( @xmath86 ) to the emergent intensity through the southern hemisphere .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are for no central star but a photon that starts at radius @xmath1 ; this comparison indicates the importance of a hard surface vs. the importance of an initial offset from the center .",
    "this table shows that the presence of a central star increases the beaming ratio significantly , when compared to the beaming ratio produced without a finite central star , both by the offset of the initial emission from the center of the scattering cloud and by the presence of a hard surface . the analytical estimate for the beaming ratio matches the numerical results well when there is no star but the photon starts at an optical depth @xmath1 .",
    "now consider what happens when the electron number density is not constant with radius .",
    "we explore three different density profiles .",
    "first , a density that goes as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the radius of the scattering region .",
    "second , a density that is @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "third , a density that is @xmath91 for @xmath90 and @xmath89 for @xmath93 . in table  2",
    "we compare the beaming ratios for these three different density profiles (  quad \" ,  2@xmath941 \" , and  1@xmath942 \" , respectively ) , for @xmath83 and the same total optical depth @xmath95 from the center to @xmath88 . in each case",
    "we assume a pencil beam specific intensity originating from the center of the scattering cloud .",
    "this table shows that , compared to a uniform - density scattering cloud , a cloud with an edge concentration yields a higher anisotropy as seen at infinity .",
    "this is because the lower the number density is close in , the farther photons can travel before scattering . for a pencil - beam specific intensity",
    "this is effectively similar to having the source of the radiation be offset from the center by a relatively large distance , implying that the anisotropy of the emergent radiation is larger than it would have been for uniform density .",
    "conversely , a cloud with a central concentration yields a lower anisotropy at infinity than if the cloud had uniform density .      using the same treatment as brainerd & lamb ( 1987 )",
    ", we find that as @xmath96 the scattering green s function approaches    @xmath97\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the angular distance between the observer and the point of emission and there is no dependence on the longitude @xmath8 of the observer .",
    "we wish to determine the intensity seen at infinity if the emission pattern on the surface has some number of lobes ( equivalently , for some harmonic ) .",
    "consider first the lobe structure used by brainerd & lamb , which is that the intensity on the surface is proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "this intensity pattern is appropriate for an emission that has a favored axis , such as a centered dipole .",
    "if the center of the emission is at an angle @xmath99 and the observer is at an angle @xmath9 , then the cosine of the angle between them is just @xmath100 .",
    "the intensity seen at @xmath9 is    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the intensity at the stellar surface at the colatitude @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath8 term will therefore always integrate to zero , regardless of the number of lobes .",
    "the intensity is then    @xmath104 ( 1+\\cos n\\theta^\\prime)\\sin\\theta^\\prime d\\theta^\\prime\\\\ & = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } { 1\\over{4\\pi}}\\left[1+\\left(2\\over{4-n^2}\\right)\\left(1+\\tau_r\\over { 1+\\tau_c}\\right)\\cos\\theta\\right]i_0\\ ; , & n{\\rm \\ odd } \\\\ { 1\\over{4\\pi}}i_0\\ ; , & n{\\rm \\ even } \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath105 .",
    "note that a fraction @xmath106 of the photons will escape directly , and hence for finite @xmath2 the amplitude at even harmonics is nonzero but small .",
    "this extends the result of brainerd & lamb ( 1987 ) to photons offset from the center of the scattering cloud : for emission symmetric around an axis , even - lobed patterns are attenuated much more rapidly than are odd - lobed patterns , and odd - lobed patterns with @xmath44 are more rapidly attenuated than is the @xmath48 pattern .",
    "consider now a pattern that is symmetric about the equatorial plane but is not axisymmetric .",
    "this is the pattern of interest for any rotationally or orbitally modulated emission , such as the emission believed to produce the higher - frequency qpo peaks observed during persistent emission from neutron - star lmxbs , which is symmetric about the rotational equator but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "specifically , consider an emission pattern @xmath107 $ ] , where @xmath108 . in this case , the intensity seen at infinity in the direction @xmath9 is    @xmath109    where @xmath19 is the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath110 : @xmath111    the @xmath112dependent terms in this integral are proportional to either @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",

    "therefore , in the diffusion limit ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath119 for @xmath44 .",
    "this result means that for _ any _ emission pattern that is symmetric about the rotational equator , _ all _ overtones are attenuated extremely rapidly , not just the even harmonics .",
    "in particular , note that it is not necessary to have the same @xmath22 dependence at all latitudes ; an arbitrary emission pattern symmetric about the equator can be built up using pairs of rings of the form @xmath120)h(\\phi^\\prime)$ ] , where @xmath121 is some function of @xmath22 ( @xmath122 can , therefore , be fourier decomposed into terms proportional to @xmath123 ) .",
    "this is a strong reason why , even if the fundamental is strong at the sonic - point keplerian frequency , we do not expect to see significant peaks in the power spectrum at overtones of @xmath124 .",
    "figure  2 shows the fractional rms amplitude of different harmonics as a function of the optical depth of the scattering cloud .",
    "here we assume a pencil - beam specific intensity and straight - line photon propagation , and we assume that the central object has a radius of @xmath125 optical depths .",
    "therefore , @xmath126 would mean that there is no scattering cloud ; @xmath127 would mean that the radial optical depth from the stellar surface to the edge of the cloud is @xmath128 , and so on .",
    "as in figure  1 , @xmath47 is the number of lobes in the radiation emission pattern from the surface ; thus @xmath48 is the fundamental of the spin frequency , @xmath49 is the first overtone , and so on . for harmonic number",
    "@xmath47 we assume an emission intensity proportional to @xmath129 ; for an intensity actually proportional to @xmath130 , with @xmath131 , the magnitude of the amplitude must be multiplied by @xmath132 .",
    "this figure shows that all overtones of the fundamental oscillation frequency are attenuated rapidly by scattering .",
    "+      heretofore we have considered only a pencil beam type of specific intensity . in reality , the angular dependence of the specific intensity is likely to differ from a pencil beam . in figure",
    "3 we show the rms amplitude vs. optical depth for a pencil beam , for the beamed pattern appropriate for radiation generated at great depth ( see chandrasekhar 1960 , chapter 3 ) , and for an isotropic beam .",
    "these different specific intensity distributions have different uses .",
    "a pencil beam may be considered to set an upper limit on the anisotropy , but it is unlikely to be of direct significance in the physical situations considered here . the beamed pattern appropriate for radiation generated at great depth that propagates to the surface via isotropic scattering is likely to represent well the emergent radiation pattern from an x - ray burst . an isotropic specific intensity may be a good model for the radiation produced by accretion , since the energy is likely to be released in a shallow layer . from this figure",
    ", we see that , as expected , the more beamed the pattern the greater the rms amplitude of variation for a given surface intensity distribution .",
    "we also see that the chandrasekhar - type specific intensity gives a modulation amplitude closer to an isotropic beam than to a pencil beam .",
    "+      as we described in   2 , the code has the capability to follow curved photon trajectories .",
    "we show the effects of light deflection in a scattering cloud in figure  4 and figure  5 .",
    "figure  4 plots the rms amplitude vs. @xmath66 for different numbers of nodes for a pencil beam with @xmath125 , @xmath133 .",
    "figure  5 compares the amplitude vs. @xmath66 for @xmath125 , @xmath133 for a pencil beam ( solid line ) , an isotropic beam ( dotted line ) , and a pencil beam which undergoes no light deflection after it escapes from the scattering cloud ( dashed line ) .",
    "the curves in figure  5 , especially those for the pencil beam with and without deflection after escape , demonstrate that there are actually two effects on the amplitude that compete with each other .",
    "the deflection of light after escape spreads out the beam , and hence decreases the amplitude .",
    "the deflection of light between scatters , however , can have the opposite effect .",
    "for a given distance traveled after one scatter , the subsequent scatter is angularly closer to the first because the photon travels in a curved trajectory .",
    "this tends to increase the number of scatters , because the coordinate distance traveled is less between scatterings .",
    "however , for a fixed number of scatters the angular distance traveled is smaller , and hence the effective isotropization is diminished .",
    "the overall effect is always that the modulation amplitude decreases with increasing compactness @xmath66 , but figure  5 shows that for @xmath134 the amplitude would increase with increasing @xmath66 if there were no deflection after escape .",
    "another important question is how great a modulation amplitude is to be expected _ inside _ a scattering cloud . for example , in the sonic - point model ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) the lower - frequency qpo in a pair is generated by the interaction of radiation at the surface with clumps of matter in the disk .",
    "the radiation is modulated at the stellar spin frequency , and thus the mass accretion rate from the clump is modulated at the difference between the sonic - point keplerian frequency and the stellar spin frequency . from no source with kilohertz qpos has there been a strong peak at the stellar spin frequency detected in the power density spectrum , and hence it is important to determine if it is possible that the modulation at the spin frequency is strong near the star , where the beat frequency is generated , yet weak enough at infinity that no peak in the power density spectrum is evident .",
    "it is not easy to compute the modulation in mass accretion rate that results from a given modulation amplitude in the radiation force or any of the components of the radiation stress - energy tensor , because the effects of radiation drag can be nonlinear .",
    "for example , since extra radiation drag increases the radial velocity of gas and thus decreases the optical depth from the stellar surface (  radiation - induced transparency \" ; see miller & lamb 1996 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , a small increase in radiation drag can in principle lead to a large increase in the accretion rate .",
    "nonetheless , as a proof of principle we can calculate the radiation energy density , to determine if it is modulated significantly near the star .",
    "figure  6 shows the result of this calculation .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath125 and @xmath133 , for illustrative purposes , and we assume a central star of radius @xmath135 . the solid line shows the fractional rms amplitude of the modulation in the radiation energy density , and the horizontal dotted line shows the fractional rms amplitude in the energy density as observed at infinity .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the modulation amplitude can be much higher near the star than at infinity .",
    "for example , the rms amplitude is more than ten times as high at the surface of the star as it is at infinity .",
    "this confirms that a brightness oscillation can have strong effects near the star , but be relatively weak at infinity .",
    "the amplitude of beaming oscillations as seen at infinity depends on a number of variables , including the radiation pattern on the surface of the star , the angular width of the specific intensity , the size of the star , and the size , optical depth , and density profile of the scattering cloud .",
    "some of the trends evident from this paper are ( 1 )  when there is a scattering cloud , the observed amplitudes of all overtones are much less than the observed amplitude of the fundamental , ( 2 )  a brightness oscillation that is weak or undetectable with current instruments at infinity can nonetheless have a significant amplitude near the star , and ( 3 )  the presence of a finite - sized star in the center of a scattering cloud decreases the attenuation of beaming oscillations compared to the attenuation expected when the photons are emitted at the center of the cloud .",
    "these results are particularly useful in the study of the kilohertz qpos from neutron - star lmxbs .",
    "spectral models ( see lamb 1989 ; miller & lamb 1992 ; psaltis et al .",
    "1995 ) suggest that many of the neutron stars in lmxbs are surrounded by hot central coronae with radii of @xmath136  cm and optical depths @xmath137 .",
    "the observed amplitudes of kilohertz qpos , combined with a detailed model of them , can be used to place further restrictions on the radius and optical depth of the central corona , and possibly even on the compactness of the neutron star .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results presented here on attenuation of beaming oscillations explain several features of the kilohertz qpos , including why no overtones of a beaming oscillation have been detected and why the beaming oscillation at the stellar spin frequency can be strong enough near the star to generate a beat - frequency qpo ( see miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , yet too weak to detect at infinity .",
    "the attenuation factors at frequencies such as the keplerian qpo frequency , the spin frequency , and the overtones and sidebands of these fundamental frequencies depend on the radius and optical depth of the scattering cloud and on the redshift at the surface of the neutron star , and hence detections of qpos at these frequencies , or strong upper limits on their amplitudes , provide a valuable source of information about the conditions near neutron stars .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank fred lamb and dimitrios psaltis for discussions about the optical depths and radii of coronae in lmxbs , and don lamb and carlo graziani for their comments on early versions of the ideas contained in this paper .",

    "<S> observations with the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer have revealed kilohertz quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) from nearly twenty different neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies often appear as a pair of kilohertz qpos in a given power density spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is extremely likely that the frequency of the higher - frequency of these qpos is the orbital frequency of gas at some radius near the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> it is also likely that the qpos are caused by the movement of bright arcs or luminous clumps around the star , which produce a modulation in the observed x - ray intensity as they are periodically occulted by the star or as they present a different viewing aspect to the observer at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> if this picture is correct , it means that this type of qpo is a beaming oscillation . in such models </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that there will also be beaming oscillations at the stellar spin frequency and at overtones of the orbital frequency , but no strong qpos have been detected at these frequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore examine the processes that can attenuate beaming oscillations near neutron stars , and in doing so extend the work on this subject that was initiated by the discovery of lower - frequency qpos from lmxbs . </S>",
    "<S> we consider attenuation by scattering , attenuation by light deflection , and the decrease in modulation caused by integration over the visible surface of the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are ( 1 )  in a spherical scattering cloud , _ all _ overtones of rotationally modulated beaming oscillations are attenuated strongly , not just the even harmonics , ( 2 )  the amount of attenuation is diminished , and hence the observed modulation amplitude is increased , by the presence of a central , finite - sized star , even if the scattering cloud is much larger than the star , and ( 3 )  if the specific intensity of radiating points on the star has a large angular width , then even with zero optical depth from the stellar surface to the observer , and even in the approximation of straight - line photon propagation , the modulation amplitude seen at infinity is decreased significantly by integration over the visible portion of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the modulation of flux as seen at infinity with the modulation near the star , and show that ( 4 )  it is possible to have a relatively high - amplitude modulation near the star at , e.g. , the stellar spin frequency , even if no peak at that frequency is detectable in a power density spectrum taken at infinity . </S>"
