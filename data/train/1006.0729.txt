    "the usual approach to the study of systems with complex energy spectra , such as nuclei , atoms , molecules , and quantum dots , is via random matrices .",
    "these are matrices filled with random numbers whose sole restriction is to satisfy the symmetries of the system under investigation @xcite .",
    "time - reversal invariant systems with rotational symmetry , for instance , are described by the so - called gaussian orthogonal ensembles ( goes ) , which consist of ensembles of real symmetric random matrices .",
    "the range of applicability of random matrix theory ( rmt ) was further extended after the connection with classical chaos became established .",
    "it was verified that the spectra of quantum systems that behave chaotically in the classical limit show the same fluctuation properties obtained with ensembles of random matrices .",
    "this observation was stated in the form of a conjecture @xcite and initiated the field of quantum chaos .",
    "the most commonly used quantities to identify the onset of quantum chaos are based on the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian describing the system under investigation , however the structures of the eigenvectors have also a very important role @xcite .",
    "the eigenvectors of a system whose classical counterpart is chaotic are expected to be maximally delocalized . according to berry s conjecture @xcite ,",
    "the eigenfunctions become superpositions of plane waves with random phases and gaussian random amplitudes .",
    "berry s conjecture has been connected to the problem of thermalization in isolated quantum systems @xcite . as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` a bounded , isolated quantum system of many particles in a specific initial state will approach thermal equilibrium if the energy eigenfunctions which are superposed to form that state obey berry s conjecture '' .",
    "it is possible to show that such eigenstates lead to the appropriate ( maxwell - boltzmann , bose - einstein , or fermi - dirac ) distribution for the momentum of the particles in the system  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "eigenstate expectation values ( eevs ) do not fluctuate between eigenstates that are close in energy and hence they coincide with the microcanonical average .",
    "the latter became known as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) .",
    "the interest in the problem of thermalization , and in the dynamics of isolated quantum systems far from equilibrium in general , was recently boosted by experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "in particular , the antagonistic results obtained with a bosonic gas in quasi - one - dimensional geometries , where thermalization was inferred to occur in one experiment @xcite but was not observed in another one @xcite , motivated various theoretical studies of nonintegrable one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems after a quench .",
    "a special property of the 1d systems that have been analyzed is the possibility to reach both integrable and nonintegrable regimes by adjusting parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "it was verified that close to the integrable point , eth ceases to be valid and thermalization does not happen @xcite .",
    "but the absence of thermalization has also been linked to other factors , such as the effects of particle statistics in finite systems @xcite and the proximity of the energy of the initial state to the energy of the ground state of the system after the quench @xcite .",
    "a close inspection of the static properties of the models being studied can anticipate the results for the dynamics  @xcite . in finite 1d lattices ,",
    "the integrable - chaos transition for fermions has been shown to require larger integrability - breaking terms than for bosons , which can explain the lack of thermalization of the former in certain regimes  @xcite .",
    "models describing realistic systems involve only few - body interactions , therefore random matrices need to be substituted by banded matrices @xcite . in clean systems , such as the ones involved in recent studies @xcite ,",
    "these sparse matrices do not even contain random elements .",
    "full random matrices and banded matrices may show similar spectral statistics , but they differ in terms of level density , the first showing a semicircular spectrum and the latter a gaussian spectrum , and in terms of eigenstates .",
    "contrary to full random matrices , where all eigenstates are random vectors , in the case of finite range interactions , chaos develops only away from the edges of the spectrum , so it is only there that the eigenstates can satisfy eth .",
    "this explains why nonequilibrium initial states with energy close to the borders of the spectrum are not expected to thermalize  @xcite .",
    "further factors that have been associated with the absence of thermalization in finite 1d systems are the opening of a gap as one crosses a superfluid to insulator transition @xcite , and the existence of `` rare '' states , which for nonintegrable systems have been speculated to persist in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in general , the question of thermalization as one crosses a superfluid ( metal ) to insulator transition has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "we have recently argued that thermalization does happen in the gapped side of the phase diagram , and that as one increases the system size it occurs deeper into that side @xcite .",
    "we did not find evidence of the existence of rare states in those systems @xcite .",
    "thermalization ceased to occur only when the system approached the atomic limit and the eigenstates started to localize in the momentum basis .",
    "in the present work , we further analyze the issue of thermalization in systems that approach a localization regime close to the atomic limit .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , localization refers here to the broad notion of contraction of the eigenstates in a particular basis set , instead of the more specific concept of spatial localization due to disorder .",
    "disorder is absent in the systems that we consider . in comparison to ref .",
    "@xcite , an extra complication is added to our studies : when analyzing the observables of interest , some discrete symmetries are not removed .",
    "we then address the role of such symmetries in their static and dynamical properties .",
    "it is well known that the mixing of symmetries may conceal key features of the chaotic regime , such as level repulsion @xcite .",
    "could it affect also the validity of the eth ?",
    "we show that the structure of eigenvectors that belong to different subspaces remain very similar in the chaotic region . as a result ,",
    "eevs do not fluctuate and the eth continues to be valid .",
    "we focus on 1d systems of hard - core bosons ( hcbs ) at half - filling , with nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping ( @xmath0 ) and interaction ( @xmath1 ) and with next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interaction ( @xmath2 ) . in the absence of nnn interaction ,",
    "the model is integrable ; we study how integrability is broken by @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath3 a transition to localization in the momentum basis starts to take place and is reflected in the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "we study how this second transition affects the eevs of various few - body observables and their off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "eevs and the off - diagonal elements of the observables are related to the occurrence of thermalization and to the time evolution of the system after a quench , respectively .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , we study a 1d hcb model with nn hopping @xmath0 and interaction @xmath1 , and nnn interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the size of the chain , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator on site @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the boson local density operator .",

    "it consists of independent blocks , where each one is associated with a value of @xmath11 and a total momentum @xmath12 .",
    "here we study chains with an even number of sites and at half - filling , @xmath13 , and consider all values of @xmath12 , from 0 to @xmath14 . at half - filling ,",
    "other symmetries are found : particle - hole exists for all @xmath12 s and parity appears only for @xmath15 .",
    "we perform full exact diagonalization of each @xmath12-sector separately for chains of 18 , 20 and 22 sites .",
    "the dimension @xmath16 of each @xmath12-sector is given in table [ table : dimensions ] .",

    "we fix @xmath22 and vary @xmath2 from 0 to 10 .",
    "the system is integrable when @xmath23 , while the addition of nnn interaction may lead to the onset of chaos .",

    "a small bond - ordered phase develops around @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 , the system approaches the atomic limit . due to the translational invariance of model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian approach the eigenstates of the total momentum operator .",
    "notions of phase - space trajectory and lyapunov exponent , which are used to distinguish regular from chaotic motion in classical mechanics , have no meaning in the quantum domain .",
    "nevertheless , criteria exist to separate quantum systems whose classical counterpart are chaotic from those whose classical counterpart are regular . signatures of quantum chaos are obtained from the eigenvalues and from the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian .",
    "spectral observables , such as level spacing distribution , level number variance , and spectral rigidity are intrinsic indicators of the integrable - chaos transition @xcite . however , a main disadvantage associated with the computation of these quantities is the need to identify and separate all symmetry sectors of the system .",
    "it is only after the separation that the spectrum may be unfolded and the analysis carried out .",
    "the distribution of spacings @xmath25 of neighboring energy levels is the most frequently used observable to study short - range fluctuations in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "quantum levels of integrable systems are not prohibited from crossing and the distribution is poissonian , @xmath26 in non - integrable systems , crossings are avoided and the level spacing distribution is given by the wigner - dyson distribution , as predicted by rmt .",
    "the form of the wigner - dyson distribution depends on the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "ensembles of random matrices with time reversal invariance and rotational symmetry , the goes , lead to @xmath27 the same distribution form is expected for hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in the chaotic regime , even though @xmath28 has only two - body interactions and does not contain random elements .",

    "@xmath30 is computed for each @xmath12-sector separately and the results are then averaged between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and between the rest of the @xmath12-sectors . the decision to perform two different averages",
    "is made because inside each @xmath12-sector , particle - hole symmetry is present for all @xmath12 s , but parity exists only for @xmath15 ; in addition , all the sectors in each average behave very similarly .",
    "the top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : psipr ] clearly show that the distribution of spacings never becomes equal to @xmath33 , instead they show an intermediate behavior between @xmath34 and @xmath33 , even though we do expect these systems to be chaotic away from @xmath23 .",

    "this is an interesting effect that results from approaching the atomic limit while imposing translational symmetry .",
    "other relevant bases include the mean - field basis  @xcite , which corresponds to choosing the eigenstates of the integrable hamiltonian ( @xmath23 ) as a basis and therefore captures localization as @xmath41 @xcite , and the site basis , which is meaningful in studies of spatial localization .",

    "@xmath12-sectors for the same values of @xmath2 used in the study of the level spacing distributions ( top panels ) .",
    "while the results for @xmath30 hardly change with @xmath2 , three different regimes can be singled out from the behavior of @xmath45 .",
    "( i ) when @xmath46 , the values of @xmath45 fluctuate considerably for states very close in energy , which agrees with our expectations for a system in the integrable regime  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) for intermediate values of @xmath2 [ @xmath47 for @xmath29 ] , @xmath45 becomes a smooth function of energy , which suggests the crossover to chaos  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) at large values of @xmath2 , energy bands are created and the @xmath45 once again fluctuates considerably .",
    "we also notice that in the scenario ( iii ) , @xmath45 decreases significantly , signaling localization in @xmath12-space .",
    "the two transitions  @xcite , from integrability to chaos as @xmath2 increases from zero and from chaos to localization in @xmath12-space as @xmath49 , are therefore clearly captured by @xmath45 , despite the inclusion of eigenstates from different subspaces .",
    "two separated curves are clearly distinguished in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : psipr ] when @xmath50 .",
    "this is caused by two combined factors .",
    "first , particle - hole symmetry exists for all @xmath12-sectors , but parity is only present for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the eigenstates from the two latter subspaces can not spread as much as those pertaining to @xmath51 and so exhibit smaller values of @xmath45 .",
    "second , the structures of the eigenstates from different @xmath12-sectors , containing the same number of internal symmetries , are very similar and do not fluctuate in the chaotic region . as a result ,",
    "the two domains , regular with large fluctuations and chaotic with no fluctuations , are well distinguished .",
    "this explains why the analysis of @xmath45 is an efficient way to detect the transition to chaos even when we do not separate the eigenstates according to all of their symmetry sectors .    with increasing system size",
    ", we find that chaotic behavior beyond @xmath52 can be observed for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is shown in the appendix ( a.1 ) , where we argue that similar conclusions , as the ones presented here with @xmath45 , are reached with the shannon entropy .",
    "further information about the structure of the eigenvectors may be obtained with the so - called structural entropy , which is defined as @xcite    @xmath53    @xmath54 contains the contribution to the information entropy which is not found in the ipr .",

    "[ fig : structural ] we show s@xmath57 for _ all _ @xmath12-sectors and for two system sizes , @xmath56 and @xmath29 .",
    "the results for all sectors are remarkably similar and superpose each other .",
    "the plots reveal again the same three regimes identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : psipr ] .",
    "( i ) for @xmath41 , eigenstates very close in energy have different levels of complexity , as typical of integrable systems .",
    "( ii ) the structures of the states become comparable to random vectors in the middle of the spectrum when chaos is reached [ when @xmath47 for @xmath29 ] .",
    "the two - body interactions are responsible for the bowl - shaped curve and the fluctuations at the edges of the spectrum .",
    "( iii ) as the system moves to localization in the @xmath12-basis , for large @xmath2 , energy bands accompanied by large fluctuations of the values of s@xmath57 become evident .",
    "the fact that the analysis of s@xmath57 does not require the identification and separation of symmetry sectors supports our claim that quantities associated with the eigenvectors may , in many instances , be better suited than spectral observables for studying the integrable - chaos transition , especially when unknown symmetries may be present .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : structural ] , we present results for two system sizes , @xmath56 and @xmath29 .",
    "the results are very similar , but s@xmath57 for @xmath56 exhibits larger fluctuations , particularly in the chaotic region , i.e. fluctuations decrease in the chaotic regime as @xmath5 increases .",
    "also , for large values of @xmath2 , where eigenstates are grouped in bands with similar energies , s@xmath57 shows that those bands shift as the system size increases .",

    "fig : stdev ] we compare the standard deviation of the structural entropy , @xmath59 for states in the middle of the spectrum for different lattice sizes . as @xmath2 increases from zero , @xmath60 captures the two transitions of model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "this is particularly visible for @xmath29 , where large fluctuations appear in the integrable domain ( @xmath46 ) and in the localization regime ( @xmath61 ) , while small fluctuations are associated with the onset of chaos .    in relation to the low energy behavior of these systems , the opening of the gap @xmath62 between the ground state and the first excited state , signaling the onset of the superfluid to insulator transition ( the ground state becomes four - fold degenerate in the insulating side ) is well illustrated by the curve for @xmath56 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev ] [ boundary effects conceal the transition for @xmath58 and 22 ] . by comparing the value of @xmath2 for the chaos - localization transition with the value for the superfluid - insulator transition ,",
    "it becomes clear that an overlap between chaotic regime and gapped phase exists for the finite systems considered here . in the case of @xmath56 , for instance , the opening of the gap is already evident when @xmath63 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev ] ) , while the formation of energy bands followed by the localization in the momentum basis requires @xmath64 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : structural ] , [ fig : stdev ] , and [ fig : entl20 ] ) .    the dispersion in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev ] makes evident also the dependence of the results on @xmath5 .",
    "larger systems imply smaller fluctuations .",
    "moreover , as @xmath5 increases , smaller values of @xmath2 already lead to the first transition from integrability to chaos and larger values of @xmath2 are required for the second transition from chaos to localization .",
    "the shift of @xmath2 to larger values for the second transition shows that , as the system increases , chaoticity appears deeper into the gapped phase . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", one may even speculate that any @xmath65 might suffice to guarantee the chaoticity of the system .",
    "these results reinforce the claim that the superfluid - insulator transition does not affect the behavior of the bulk of the eigenstate of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the uniformization of the eigenvectors in the chaotic regime has been manifested in our studies of ipr , s@xmath57 and s in figs .",
    "[ fig : psipr ] , [ fig : structural ] , [ fig : stdev ] [ fig : shannon ] , and [ fig : entl20 ] .",
    "the results prompt us to advocate , as in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , that in certain situations quantities to measure the complexity of the eigenstates may be better indicators of quantum chaos than spectral observables . the analysis of the eigenstates hints also on what to expect in terms of thermalization .",
    "thermalization has since long been associated with chaos and ergodicity . at the classical level",
    ", the idea is well established @xcite , while in the quantum domain the connection is based on a hypothesis , the eth .",
    "according to the eth  @xcite , the eigenstate expectation values ( eevs ) of few - body observables do not fluctuate between eigenstates that are close in energy and hence they coincide with the microcanonical average .",
    "this reflects the fact that in the chaotic regime the structure of the eigenstates in a small interval of energy may be thought as equivalent .",
    "the smooth behavior of eevs with energy , which is achieved in the chaotic domain , is discussed and illustrated in the next section .",
    "here , we provide numerical support for the connection between the eth and quantum chaos .",
    "this is done based on the analysis of the eevs of four different observables :    \\(i ) the kinetic energy , @xmath66    \\(ii ) the interaction energy , @xmath67    \\(iii ) the momentum distribution function , @xmath68    \\(iv ) and the density - density correlation structure factor , @xmath69 since the operator for the total number of bosons commutes with the hamiltonian , the expectation value of @xmath70 is simply @xmath71 .",

    "the results parallel the findings for the eigenstates obtained in the previous section . as @xmath2 increases and one departs from integrability , the fluctuations are significantly reduced away from the borders of the spectrum , and eth becomes valid .",
    "it is remarkable that despite the inclusion of eevs for all disconnected @xmath12-sectors , the results are still very similar for eigenstates that are close in energy @xcite .",

    "[ fig : psipr ] ) , the behavior of the eevs in all @xmath12-sectors is very similar .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that if some discrete symmetries are not accounted for when diagonalizing the hamiltonian , eth will still be valid in the chaotic regime .",
    "no separation of the eevs occurs for different symmetry sectors .    the smooth behavior of eevs with energy , which is characteristic of the chaotic domain , continues to hold beyond the superfluid - insulator transition ( compare figs .

    "[ fig : stdev ] ) , further confirming that the latter is irrelevant for the discussion of the validity of eth . by increasing @xmath2",

    "initial states with energy close to the borders of the spectrum may therefore be unable to thermalize .    in the present work ,",
    "we have focused on how the onset of chaos and the behavior of the eevs may be affected by two other factors : the transition to localization and the presence of symmetries . on the way",
    ", we have shown that the opening of a gap in the ground state does not prevent thermalization .",
    "even if the ground state of the system becomes an insulator , the structures of the eigenstates in the chaotic domain and close in energy , as well as the corresponding eevs , do not fluctuate away from the edges of the spectrum .",
    "all eevs of eigenstates close in energy were seen to become very similar , independently of the @xmath12-sector they belong to and of discrete symmetries that may not have been accounted for during the diagonalization .",
    "this means that we do not find signs of rare states  @xcite in those systems .",
    "moreover , the range of values of @xmath2 over which the eth holds increases with @xmath5 , carrying the viability of thermalization deeper into the insulating phase .",
    "this corroborates our findings in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a system with 1/3 filling was considered .",
    "in addition to the conservation of the total number of particles , the systems that we have analyzed presented also translational , reflection , and particle - hole symmetries .",
    "chaos indicators based on the eigenvalues may miss the transition to chaos when different symmetry sectors are mixed .",
    "level repulsion is a main feature of chaotic systems , but to be noticeable it requires the examination of each symmetry sector separately .",
    "this is not the case for quantities that depend on the eigenvectors . in the chaotic domain ,",
    "eigenstates from different symmetry sectors were still found to have very similar structures .",
    "therefore , the lack of fluctuations of quantities measuring the complexity of the eigenvectors , such as the structural entropy , or similarly , the lack of fluctuations of eevs for eigenstates close in energy , has been shown to be a reliable alternative to identifying the chaotic region , especially in situations where unknown symmetries may be present .    in terms of what to expect for the dynamics , we have shown that in the chaotic regime the off - diagonal elements of the few - body observables of interest are very small , so that time fluctuations after relaxation are expected to be small . at integrability , @xmath23 ,",
