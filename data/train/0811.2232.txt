    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold : to show how standard schrdinger equation analysis familiar in a simple physics situation may be used to understand an important problem in biology , and to study , via such an analysis , the effect of spatial variation of resources on the ecologically relevant problem of extinction of populations of biological species .",
    "extinction in biology is intimately related , as we shall show below , to abrupt transitions in physical systems , and is important whether the focus is on the dynamics of bacteria in a petri dish @xcite or of the movement of larger animals such as rodents involved in the spread of epidemics @xcite .",
    "consider the logistic equation @xmath0 which may describe the time dependence of the density @xmath1 of a spatially uniform population subject to a growth rate @xmath2 and a resource competition term controlled by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the steady state density undergoes a transcritical bifurcation at @xmath4 as @xmath2 is varied from negative to positive values .",
    "the physical meaning of the bifurcation is straightforward . whereas for positive @xmath2 the stable steady state value of @xmath1 is @xmath5 , for negative @xmath2 the density vanishes in the steady state because the growth rate is then really a death rate .",
    "introduction of space as a mere parameter @xmath6 brings in no new behavior .",
    "a new aspect does enter , however , if spatial _ derivatives _ are introduced into eq .",
    "( [ logistic ] ) through , for instance , diffusion terms which represent the motion of the members of the species from one spatial location to another .",
    "it is this situation , represented by a fisher equation @xcitewith spatially varying growth rate @xmath7 and diffusion constant @xmath8 , @xmath9 that is the subject of the present paper .",
    "we study the 1-d case for simplicity . as expected , the steady state @xmath10 has a tendency to follow the spatial variation of the growth rate @xmath7 but is modified by the effects of diffusion .",
    "for instance , if @xmath7 has the value @xmath2 in a segment of space , and the value @xmath11 outside it , as shown first by skellam @xcite , @xmath10 is given by the square of the elliptic @xmath12 function @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath10 , which is maximum at the center of the favorable region and drops off gradually towards the edges , is not proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "the latter has the shape of a step function",
    ".    equation ( [ fisher ] ) , which has been quite successful in the description of ecological dynamics @xcite , predicts interesting behavior in addition to the mere difference in shapes of @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath13 of the density within the favorable region , i.e. , the spatial segment in which @xmath7 is positive , naturally depends on the length @xmath14 of the segment , and decreases if @xmath14 is decreased .",
    "what is striking is that there is a minimum value of @xmath14 below which @xmath13 , and therefore the density throughout , vanishes identically .",
    "this minimum ( critical ) value can be obtained , except for a proportional constant equal to @xmath15 , by equating the growth time @xmath16 to the diffusion time @xmath17 : @xmath18 the underlying physical idea is that the critical length of the favorable segment corresponds to the situation that the random walker ( bacterium or animal ) traverses the length of the segment diffusively in the time necessary for growth , and falls prey to the harsh conditions outside the segment .",
    "our interest in the present paper is to ask how this well - known result @xcite is modified by the simultaneous introduction of two items of realism into the growth @xmath7 : a gradual , rather than step - like , spatial variation of the growth rate at the border of the segment , and a non - infinite value for destruction outside the segment .",
    "the latter , by itself , has been analyzed earlier @xcite but the former has not , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we provide an analysis of the combined situation below on the basis of wave function calculations from the time - independent schrdinger equation describing a quantum particle in a uniform gravitational or electrostatic field .",
    "the analysis we present is applicable to at least two specific biological systems that have been studied recently : a bacterial population in a petri dish , and rodents responsible for hantavirus infection spread . in several experiments @xcite on the former system",
    ", the bacterial population is bathed in the presence of deadly ultraviolet radiation , except in a localized region covered with a mask that protects the bacteria .",
    "the growth rate @xmath7 is positive in the protected region and negative outside . in observations of the second system , there are patches of resources which make possible population growth and sustainance of rodents such as mice in parts of the landscape but not beyond those patches .",
    "earlier analyses have treated the patches or the masks to correspond to _ sharply _ changing resources .",
    "the real experimental situation is naturally different .",
    "the ultraviolet light that falls on the mask seeps under the edges of the mask . as a consequence ,",
    "the change in the growth rate is gradual rather than sudden .",
    "similarly , the available water and food in the rodent patches change gradually in the landscape .",
    "transitions have been reported in experiments on the bacterial system @xcite following quantitative predictions made earlier @xcite .",
    "transitions also seem to be present in rodent experiments although the observations are more difficult to unravel . the observational relevance of our present investigation should be , thus , clear in both cases .",
    "the paper is set out as follows . a simple model that incorporates a gradual variation of resources in space",
    "is presented in section 2 and analytical formulae are derived in terms of airy functions .",
    "limits are studied in section 3 and concluding remarks appear in section 4 .",
    "the model we analyze is as given in eq .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) with the growth rate @xmath7 as in fig.1 .",
    "it equals the constant @xmath2 for a spatial segment of length @xmath14 around the origin @xmath19 , and drops gradually ( linearly ) to the constant negative value @xmath20 outside the segment , the spatial variation being linear ( constant slope ) . during the linear drop",
    ", the rate remains positive on either side of the segment for an additional distance @xmath21 as shown . using the suffixes @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the respective regions i , ii and iii in fig.1",
    ", we have @xmath25    we do not attempt to solve either this nonlinear partial differential equation or the corresponding nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the steady state @xmath10 obtained by setting the time derivative equal to zero .",
    "rather , we argue that , because our interest lies only in the extinction phenomenon , i.e. , the vanishing of @xmath10 , we can eliminate the bilinear terms of the density , and match solutions of the ensuing _ linear _ equation across the interfaces of the three regions i , ii and iii ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this argument appears to have been given first by ludwig et al .",
    "@xcite in his investigations of the spatial patterning of the budworm .",
    "it has been used recently by the present authors to propose double - mask experiments for the bacterial problem @xcite .",
    "the crux of the argument is that , at the transition , the densities vanish and therefore terms of order higher than the first may be safely neglected even while the linear terms are compared to extract the extinction condition . the critical value of @xmath14 signifying extinction which result for _ any positive _ @xmath3 can therefore be calculated precisely by considering the linear equation obtained by putting @xmath3 equal to zero .",
    "the problem we are presented with here is simply of finding of the wavefunction for a time - independent schrdinger equation of a quantum particle in a potential which is linear in @xmath6 as in the case of a uniform gravitational or electrostatic field .    defining the dimensionless position @xmath26 and the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "all obtained by dividing @xmath6 , @xmath29 , and @xmath21 respectively by the diffusion length @xmath30 , we focus on the linear steady state counterpart of eq .",
