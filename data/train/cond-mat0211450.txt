    "in the last decades the interest in quantum dissipation  @xcite has come mainly from the study of mesoscopic systems , which have been experimentally fabricated and theoretically analyzed . in such systems ,",
    "the characteristic quantum effects involve a macroscopic number of particles .",
    "the sizeable dimension of the devices implies that the relevant dynamical variables can couple to a very large number of degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment ( or dissipation bath ) : this coupling can be described macroscopically without caring for the details of the interaction , and can result in dramatic changes in the behavior of the system .",
    "for instance , the dissipative phase transition in josephson - junction arrays  @xcite ( jja ) .    while the classical thermodynamics is unaffected by dissipation ,",
    "its quantum counterpart is substantially modified , and it constitutes therefore an ideal field to study the genuine interplay between quantum fluctuations and dissipation , which leads in general to interesting physics in the regimes of high quantum coupling and/or low temperature .",
    "the issue of evaluating thermodynamic quantities in a quantum - dissipative system was recently faced by an extension of the effective - potential method  @xcite , that is very fruitful in the regime of intermediate quantum coupling . however , a more powerful tool is required when the aim is to study dramatic effects , as , for instance , the dissipative phase transition from superconducting to insulating behavior in jja predicted by mean - field theory . unfortunately , a suitable theoretical approach , allowing a faithful comparison with the experimental findings in the regime of high quantum coupling , is still lacking .    in this paper , we discuss an efficient path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) approach can be implemented . in section  [ s.dissipative ] the basic formalism and the connection with the phenomenological description dissipation are reviewed . the customary approach to monte carlo",
    "is set up in section  [ s.rpimc ] , where some difficulties are pointed out ; this leads us to consider fourier pimc  [ s.fpimcc ] basically extending the standard approach developed by many authors in the 80ies , involving the transformation to matsubara components and their truncation by partial averaging , that by the way leads to a reformulation of the effective potential method .",
    "we propose a slightly different scheme for the numerical computation framework in section  [ s.fpimcd ] , which overcomes some ambiguities of the former .",
    "eventually , in section  [ s.fpimcd_appl ] the latter method is applied for two reference models : it appears that working with fourier transformed variables , possibly using the knowledge of the exact quantum harmonic propagator , gives reliable results for many - body systems with reasonable numerical effort .",
    "in this paper we consider the study of dissipation effects onto the thermodynamics of a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath1      the density matrix elements in the coordinate representation are expressed by feynman s path integral as @xmath9~e^{-s[q]}~ , \\label{e.rhoqq}\\ ] ] where the path integration is defined as a sum over all paths @xmath10 , with @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the partition function reads @xmath14~e^{-s[q]}~. \\label{e.z}\\ ] ]    the usual procedure for the phenomenological identification of @xmath3 consists in comparing its explicit expression ( in terms of the dynamical variables of the oscillator bath ) with the analogous expression of the ( retarded ) damping function @xmath15 one gets in deriving the ( classical or quantum ) langevin equation of motion from the same composite hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fluctuating force .",
    "the relation that is found between @xmath3 and @xmath15 can be expressed in a simple way as a relation between their respective matsubara transform , @xmath18 and laplace transform , @xmath19 and reads @xmath20 here it is apparent that @xmath21 , i.e. the ` local part ' is assumed to be fully included as a quadratic term in the potential .",
    "the following completeness / orthogonality relations have to be taken into account : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the periodic delta function , and its inverse @xmath24      in the above dynamical equation ( [ e.langevin ] ) the bath spectral density is assumed to be such to reproduce the most useful phenomenological models , namely :    * _ ohmic ( or markovian ) dissipation_. this is characterized by the absence of memory in the dissipative term , and corresponds to assuming a separation of time scales : the time scale with which the bath responds to changes in the system is much smaller than the system s typical times . in this case dissipation can be described by one constant parameter , @xmath25 : @xmath26 * _ drude - like dissipation_. here the bath responds on a time scale @xmath27 which is comparable to the system s typical times : @xmath28 therefore , there are two parameters which describe dissipation , the intensity @xmath25 and the response frequency ( or ` spectral width ' ) @xmath29 ; for @xmath30 , i.e. , fast bath response , the ohmic form is recovered .",
    "note that @xmath31 has the dimension of a frequency , while @xmath32 is a squared frequency .",
    "only the above two cases will be considered in what follows ; although , of course , the actual physics of a problem could give more appropriate definitions of @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction along the trotter direction involves all pairs ( which is very bad from the point of view of the code efficiency ) although it is rapidly decreasing ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this suggest the possibility of cutting the interaction beyond , say , @xmath63 neighbors ( keeping only @xmath64 ) ; a rough calculation can be made assuming that the kinetic term dominates , i.e. that @xmath65 , which gives a ratio between the discarded and the included dissipative interaction energy @xmath66 . in any case",
    ", it turns out that a simulation along these lines requires to deal with long - ranged summations whose short - range part is highly singular ; moreover , if one would like to consider more physical dissipation kernels , e.g. , the drude one , the calculation of @xmath3 and of @xmath54 becomes very involute in spite of the simple expression of @xmath32 .",
    "in order to overcome the above mentioned difficulties , let us try now to face the problem from another point of view : since we know as ` initial input ' the matsubara components of the kernel , @xmath32 , it is worth to explore the possibility of using the simulation technique based on the sampling of fourier components of the path @xmath10 .",

    "<S> we address the possibility of performing numerical monte carlo simulations for the thermodynamics of quantum dissipative systems . </S>",
    "<S> dissipation is considered within the caldeira - leggett formulation , which describes the system in the path - integral formalism through the inclusion of an influence action that is bilocal and quadratic in the system s coordinates . at a first sight the usual direct approach of discretizing the path integral could seem feasible , but complications arise when one tries to introduce a physically meaningful dissipation kernel : in particular its imaginary - time dependence turns out to be severely singular and difficult to evaluate analytically , in spite of the simple expressions for its matsubara components . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose to face the numerical problem using fourier path - integral monte carlo , that can be formulated in two different ways : transforming the continuous paths and then truncating the high fourier components ( with possible improvements upon the truncation procedure ) , or performing the fourier transformation upon the discretized paths . </S>",
    "<S> the latter choice leads to a simpler formulation and allows for a better control of the extrapolation to the limit of infinite trotter number . </S>",
    "<S> the method is implemented for a single nonlinear particle with ohmic dissipation and for a @xmath0 chain with drude - like dissipation . </S>"
