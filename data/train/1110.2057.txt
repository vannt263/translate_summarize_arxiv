    "in the last decades , dephasing in quantum dots has been studied experimentally and theoretically in great detail .",
    "the theoretical description is largely based on results from random matrix theory ( rmt ) , emphasizing the universality in the description of a dot , when spatial degrees of freedom become negligible .",
    "while the universal limits are well understood and reproduced in many experiments , a prediction of the full temperature dependence of quantities which are sensitive to dephasing , such as quantum corrections to the classical conductance , @xmath0 , are challenging existing theories .",
    "since rmt is not able to describe the @xmath1 dependence on its own , several extensions were introduced in the past to describe their dependence on a dephasing time @xmath2 , which has to be included phenomenologically , see section [ sect : dephasingdots ] for details .",
    "one of the well - know problems in the theory of dephasing in quantum dots originated from the predictions of a seminal paper by sivan , imry and aronov , who showed that dephasing in the so - called 0d regime ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the thouless energy ) , behaves as @xmath5 , which results from pauli blocking of the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "however fundamental the origin of 0d dephasing is , it has so far not been observed experimentally .",
    "one possible reason for this might be the fact that dephasing is very weak in this regime , such that quantum corrections may reach their universal limit @xmath6 . in general ,",
    "if the dephasing time is much larger than the time the electron spends in the dot , @xmath0 is governed by a dwelling time @xmath7 and becomes almost @xmath1 independent .",
    "the remaining small @xmath1-dependent part of @xmath0 can be masked , for example , by other @xmath1-dependent effects coming from contacts or leads .",
    "thus , to facilitate an experimental observation of 0d dephasing , a comprehensive theory of transport in the quantum dot connected to leads via some contacts is needed , which goes beyond the simple picture provided by rmt .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative to the rmt description of the quantum dots .",
    "namely , we follow the ideas of @xcite and model the quantum dot as a network of 1d wires and use the theory of diffusion in graphs to calculate @xmath2 and @xmath0 . earlier papers either focused only on small graphs , such as 1d rings @xcite , or the authors introduced @xmath2 only phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "we generalize the theory of @xmath2 for arbitrary graphs and include the regime @xmath8 by taking into account the pauli principle . using this theory",
    ", we calculate @xmath2 for a network describing a quantum dot , taking into account effects of the contacts and the leads .",
    "this allows us to demonstrate that the @xmath9-dependence of the dephasing rate in 0d regime is substantially distorted in usual transport measurements in quantum dots .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : dephasingdots ] we give a brief review of known results for dephasing in quantum dots . in section [",
    "sect : diffusioningraphs ] , basic results from the theory of diffusion in graphs are presented , and in section [ sect : graphmodel ] we will apply this theory to construct a solvable quantum dot model as an alternative to the well - known rmt models .",
    "results for the quantum corrections to the conductance and the dephasing time are presented in the following sections . in the conclusions we compare different experimental setups where 0d dephasing could be observed .",
    "it is well - known that the conductance @xmath10 of a disordered normal metal is reduced due to quantum mechanical interference of the electron wave functions scattered at static impurities .",
    "it has been found that the reduction of @xmath10 can be expressed via the return probability of coherent electron paths , @xmath11 , ( the so - called _ cooperon _ ) integrated over time and space @xcite : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the classical conductance measured in units of @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the thouless energy of the system , @xmath16 is the diffusion constant and @xmath17 is the largest size of the system .",
    "@xmath18 is usually referred to as the _ weak localization correction_.    quantum coherence is suppressed by a constant magnetic field and by time - dependent ( noisy ) fields , or when closed electron paths contributing to @xmath11 in eq .",
    "are dephased due to inelastic scattering events .",
    "the time - scale associated with the latter is called _ dephasing time _ @xmath2 . in the absence of other sources of dephasing",
    ", @xmath19 yields an infrared cutoff for the time - integral , eq . , and governs the temperature dependence of @xmath0 @xcite . at low temperatures , @xmath20 , where phonons are frozen ,",
    "@xmath2 is dominated by electron interactions and depends on the dimensionality @xmath21 and the geometry of the system .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath2 in different regimes is governed by an interplay of @xmath2 with the thermal time @xmath22 and the thouless time @xmath23 , see table [ tab : dephasingtime ] for a summary of known regimes in 1d and 2d @xcite .",
    "[ tab : dephasingtime ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for low temperatures and small system sizes , when @xmath4 is the largest energy scale , dephasing becomes effectively zero - dimensional ( 0d ) .",
    "therefore , it must be relevant for transport in metallic ( diffusive or chaotic ) quantum dots @xcite .",
    "note that 0d dephasing requires confinement of the electron paths during times larger than @xmath24 , since quantum corrections become @xmath1 independent for @xmath25 in fully open systems .",
    "as an example , consider the case of a quasi-1d wire of length @xmath26 connected to absorbing leads , where @xmath0 reads @xcite : @xmath27 thus , a detailed calculation of @xmath0 including @xmath2 requires solving the full diffusion equation of the connected quantum dot , which is hard to achieve analytically for confined systems .    one way to circumvent this problem",
    "is to apply random - matrix theory ( rmt ) to the scattering matrix @xmath28 , describing transmission and reflection in the sample .",
    "in such an rmt - model one assumes that the elements of the hamiltonian @xmath29 describing the systems are either real ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble , @xmath30 ) or complex ( gaussian unitary ensemble , @xmath31 ) random numbers corresponding to a system with time - reversal symmetry or broken time - reversal symmetry . imposing a gaussian probability distribution @xmath32",
    ", the scattering matrix @xmath28 can be constructed using so - called r - matrix theory .",
    "alternatively , a simpler approach starts from a probability distribution of the scattering matrix directly , which is of the form @xmath33 , and @xmath28 is again only restricted by symmetry arguments . from the scattering matrix",
    ", the full non - pertubative distribution of the transmission matrix and the conductance can be obtained . while rmt is unable to predict the temperature dependence of @xmath0 on its own , the difference in @xmath10 of the cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 is equivalent to @xmath0 in the limit of @xmath36 .",
    "extensions to rmt have been introduced in the past to describe the dependence of @xmath0 on a dephasing time @xcite , e.g. by including a fictitious voltage probe into the scattering matrix which removes electrons from the phase - coherent motion of the electrons in the quantum dot @xcite , or by including an imaginary potential equal to @xmath37 in the hamiltonian from which the scattering matrix is derived @xcite .",
    "it is expected that @xmath2 included in such an approach has the same form as stated in table [ tab : dephasingtime ] for @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , but a proof of this expectation and a theory of a crossover between different regimes is still missing .",
    "in this section , we present basic results from the theory of diffusion in graphs , following ref.@xcite .",
    "a graph is defined as a set of quasi-1d wires connected to each other at vertices , see the example shown in fig.[fig : graph](a ) .    .",
    "the labels @xmath40 denote the position of the leads ( @xmath41 ) and the vertices ( @xmath42 ) on the scale @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , the numbers @xmath42 correspond to the @xmath44th row or column of the vertex matrix @xmath45 , eq.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in this section we will show how the solution to the laplace transformed diffusion equation , @xmath46 between arbitrary vertices ( with coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) of such a graph can be obtained .",
    "the time - dependent probability , required to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath2 , can be obtained via an inverse laplace transform : @xmath49    it is convenient to introduce the following quantities : we denote the wire between arbitrary vertices @xmath50 and @xmath51 as @xmath52 and its length as @xmath53 . furthermore , _ the running coordinate _ along this wire ( measured from @xmath50 ) is denoted @xmath54 , and in the following , we will not distinguish a vertex from the coordinate of the vertex on the graph : for example , @xmath55 is equivalent to @xmath56 , for any neighboring vertex @xmath51 of @xmath50 .",
    "the current conservation at some vertex @xmath57 can be written as follows : @xmath58_{x_{\\alpha \\beta } = 0 }    = \\delta_{\\alpha , \\mu } \\ , , \\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath59 means summation over all wires @xmath60 which are connected to @xmath50 .",
    "consider the point @xmath61 lying at the coordinate @xmath54 of wire @xmath60 in fig.[fig : graph](a ) .",
    "the probability to reach @xmath61 from some arbitrary other point @xmath62 of the graph can be expressed in terms of the probabilities from the neighboring vertices of @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 : @xmath63 validity of the solution ( [ eq : laplacebond ] ) can be checked directly by substituting eq . into eq ..    inserting into yields the following equations for vertex @xmath50 : @xmath64 writing down eq .",
    ", for every vertex of the graph , we obtain a set of linear equations which can be solved for arbitrary vertices .",
    "let us define a matrix @xmath45 as follows : @xmath65 it is easy to check that the diffusion probability between arbitrary vertices of the graph is given by the entries of the inverse matrix divided by the diffusion constant @xcite : @xmath66",
    "in this section we explain how to describe a connected quantum dot by a network of 1d wires .",
    "the main advantage of this model is that an exact solution to the diffusion equation can be found .",
    "consider the network shown in fig.[fig : graph](b ) .",
    "it includes 8 vertices and describes a quantum dot of total length @xmath67 attached via two contacts of length @xmath26 to absorbing leads .",
    "multiple wires connecting the same vertices ( e.g. the three wires connecting vertex @xmath68 with vertex @xmath69 ) mimic a larger number of channels . below , we use a dimensionless coordinate @xmath70 ; the position of the leads is fixed at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the position of the @xmath73rd and @xmath74th vertex , describing the connection of the dot to the contacts , is fixed at @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "the remaining 6 vertices are auxiliary : there are 3 regions in the system marked by `` l '' ( left contact ) , `` d '' ( dot ) and `` r '' ( right contact ) .",
    "we would like to describe diffusion from an arbitrary point in the system to another .",
    "therefore , we have to place two additional vertices in each region l , d , r. positions of these vertices define running coordinates .",
    "they are arbitrary within the corresponding region , thus each region is subdivided into 3 wires of varying length .",
    "the running coordinates can be expressed via the length of the connecting wires , e.g. the length of the wire connecting vertices @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 .    to describe confinement of the electrons",

    "if @xmath226 , dephasing is not sensitive to the boundary conditions and it is described by the theory of infinite systems @xcite . in the ring , the high-@xmath1 regime appears at @xmath227 .",
    "the formula for @xmath184 in this regime , including sub - leading terms , reads @xcite : @xmath228    we have reproduced this high-@xmath1 behavior in the quantum dot model , see fig.[fig : tphi](a ) : numerically obtained curves coincide with eq . , after substituting @xmath229 for @xmath225 , when @xmath230 .",
    "we note that dephasing in the high-@xmath1 regime is substantially inhomogeneous in space , since the relevant trajectories are restricted to a small region around @xmath214 .",
    "in particular , for sufficiently high @xmath1 , all curves for dephasing in the contact ( @xmath217 ) coincide with the curve for @xmath231 in the central region , since the number of channels in the central region is irrelevant for dephasing in the contact . on the other hand , dephasing in the central region itself becomes weaker with increasing @xmath95 , since @xmath80 increases the effective conductance in this region .    in the low-@xmath1 regime , ,",
    "characterized by @xmath232 is strongly distorted in the quantum dot , since : ( a ) the conductance @xmath131 is relatively small , reducing the range of validity of this regime , and ( b ) it occurs when typical electron trajectories are of the order of the system size making @xmath2 sensitive to the inhomogeneities of the graph . ]",
    "@xmath233 , typical electron trajectories explore the whole system many times before dephasing becomes effective @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the system is not important in this case and , therefore , the low-@xmath1 regime is usually referred to as _ the regime of 0d dephasing_. in the ring , it occurs at @xmath38 with @xmath2 given by @xcite @xmath234 the quantum dot model shows similar behavior at @xmath235 , after substituting @xmath236 for the ring conductance .",
    "we emphasize that 0d dephasing in our model is governed by atypical trajectories , which explore the dot and the contacts many times during the time scale @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , the dephasing time is nearly coordinate independent : dephasing in the central region and in the contacts is essentially the same .    _",
    "the correction to the conductance _ is shown in the inset , fig.[fig : tphi](c ) , for @xmath217 .",
    "we calculated @xmath0 from the integral in eq . with",
    "a position dependent @xmath238 .",
    "as expected from the discussion in section [ sect : qcorrections ] , the curves saturate to the universal value @xmath239 , when @xmath240 . since @xmath241 in this regime and @xmath131 is small and fixed",
    ", saturation occurs when @xmath242 .",
    "the intermediate regime for @xmath243 , where @xmath244 , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : totalggamma ] , is strongly distorted since it lies in the crossover region between high-@xmath1 and low-@xmath1 regime .",
    "we note that at @xmath245 , curves for different @xmath246 look very similar . moreover",
    ", dephasing is very weak at @xmath247 where @xmath18 is governed by a dwell time , @xmath248 , of the entire system and is practically @xmath1-independent . after subtracting the curve from its universal value ,",
    "see fig.[fig : tphi](b ) , 0d dephasing reveals itself as @xmath220 for very low temperatures @xmath249 . at @xmath250",
    "one can observe only a transient , since ( i ) dephasing is not yet sufficiently weak to justify @xmath220 and ( ii ) the 0d regime of dephasing is not fully reached , cf .",
    "fig.[fig : tphi](a ) . moreover , if the leads are not perfectly absorbing , the transient can be extended even to lower temperatures due to additional dephasing in the leads . all this clearly shows that 0d dephasing can not be discovered directly in transport measurements through the quantum dot .",
    "even at @xmath249 , a fitting of the experimental data would require @xmath10 to be measured with a precision of much better than @xmath221 .",
    "alternative possibilities for the experimental observation of 0d dephasing are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "we have suggested a graph model , which allows one to describe transport through mesoscopic quantum dots .",
    "the graph includes three quasi-1d regions : identical left- and right- wires and a central region .",
    "the identical wires are connected to ideally absorbing leads and mimic the contacts of a real system .",
    "the number of conducting channels in the central region can be of the order of- or substantially larger than the number of channels in the contacts .",
    "the latter case corresponds to a strong confinement of electrons in the central region .",
    "thus the graph model is able to describe a crossover from opened to closed quantum dots .    the model which we suggest can be viewed as complementary to the seminal rmt model .",
    "firstly , the exact solution to the diffusion equation can be found for the graph model .",
    "secondly , we have shown that our model correctly reproduces the universal regime of transport in full analogy with the rmt solution .",
    "even more importantly , the graph model allows us to take into account interaction induced dephasing in a broad temperature range , i.e. , we can describe the full crossover from 1d to 0d regimes .    using the solution to the diffusion equation on the graph ,",
    "we have described in detail how to calculate the dephasing time and the weak localization correction to the conductance .",
    "though the intermediate equations are rather lengthy , we have suggested an efficient combination of analytical steps ( involving computer algebra ) and numerical integration , which helped us to overcome technical difficulties .",
    "the general approach has been illustrated for the system with @xmath251 .",
    "we have demonstrated that 0d dephasing @xmath252 , which is governed by the pauli principle and is very generic , occurs in the system at @xmath247 at _ arbitrary _ ratio of the channel numbers in the dots and leads . in this regime , dephasing is governed by atypical trajectories which explore the dot and the contacts many times during the time scale @xmath237 where the conductance is governed mainly by the dwell time and is almost @xmath1-independent .",
    "our results confirm that weak 0d dephasing is substantially distorted by the influence of the contacts and the leads .",
    "therefore , its direct experimental observation in transport through the quantum dot would require not only very low temperatures but also unrealistically precise measurements .",
    "we conclude that alternative experimental approaches are needed , where either the effects from the environment are reduced or the system is closed .",
    "one possibility to improve the effective precision of the measurements is related to extracting @xmath19 from the @xmath1-dependence of the aronov - altshuler - spivak oscillations of the magnetoconductivity in almost closed mesoscopic rings .",
    "this option was discussed in recent papers @xcite where all effects of the environment were taken into account via a constant dwelling time .",
    "we plan to study in more detail the sensitivity of the aas oscillations on the distortions from the environment using a ring model similar to the model of the dot presented here @xcite .",
    "the other option is to extract @xmath19 from experimental measurements of the electric or magnetic susceptibility of _ closed _ mesoscopic systems , e.g. by measuring the properties of resonators in which mesoscopic samples are deposited @xcite . in closed systems , there is no universal limit of the quantum corrections at @xmath253 , typical for transport through opened systems .",
    "therefore , the saturation in the closed system can occur at much lower @xmath1 , making them more suitable for an experimental observation of 0d dephasing .",
    "a theoretical description of such experiments will be published elsewhere .",
