    "proton elastic and inelastic scattering at energies above about 100  mev are usually described by distorted - wave calculations based on an effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction .",
    "when the interaction with the projectile proton is summed , or `` folded , '' over all the nucleons in the target , the resulting potential can be used to model elastic scattering . in addition , the same effective nn interaction becomes the transition potential in the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) that connects to excited states of the target when the struck nucleon moves to a new shell - model orbit , creating a particle - hole pair .",
    "the many - body effects of the nuclear medium are usually incorporated through modifications to this effective nn interaction that depend on the local nuclear density .",
    "systematic studies @xcite have shown that one important contribution to the many - body effects is pauli blocking , particularly at the lower end of the intermediate energy range .",
    "this is the mechanism which prevents nucleons in the nuclear medium from scattering to occupied intermediate states @xcite .",
    "this restriction is included through a projection operator in the bethe - goldstone equation for the @xmath0-matrix elements that describe the effective nn interaction inside the nuclear medium .",
    "the usual practice is to average the pauli projection operator over the intermediate state scattering angle .",
    "if , instead of this `` spherical '' approximation , the non - spherical components are retained , new @xmath0-matrix elements appear @xcite . while remaining diagonal in total spin @xmath1 and isospin @xmath2 , the angular dependence allows coupled @xmath0-matrix elements that connect partial wave states where @xmath3 and @xmath4 beyond the @xmath5 coupling generated by the tensor interaction .",
    "the expanded set of @xmath0-matrix elements also depends on @xmath6 , the magnetic quantum number of the total angular momentum @xmath7 . in studies that considered the effects on nuclear binding energies , small but non - negligible changes were found when these modifications to the @xmath0-matrix were included @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the spherical approximation is adequate for the central and spin - orbit parts of the effective interaction @xcite , those pieces that matter the most for elastic scattering and the excitation of natural - parity transitions .",
    "but no calculations have been made to check quantitatively in a comparison with scattering measurements how important it is to treat the non - spherical pauli blocking components .    in a recent calculation of the non - spherical @xmath0-matrix @xcite",
    ", we observed that the new couplings in @xmath7 and @xmath8 generated only small matrix elements , but the variation of the @xmath0-matrix elements with respect to @xmath6 , the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath7 , was comparable to the typical size of conventional medium effects .",
    "thus it seemed appropriate to investigate whether these modifications could have an impact on nuclear reactions , and in particular on their spin observables , which are most sensitive to the non - spherical components of the nuclear force .",
    "proton scattering offers a rich set of polarization observables , including polarization transfer , that reflect the spin dependence of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction itself .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 has been considered previously in calculations of deuteron binding when the deuteron is treated as a projectile traveling through the nuclear medium @xcite . while pauli blocking reduces the deuteron binding energy as the density increases , the amount depends on whether the projection of the deuteron s spin , @xmath9 , is 0 or 1 when the quantization axis is taken to be along the direction of motion of the deuteron through nuclear matter .",
    "this difference generates a @xmath10-type momentum - dependent tensor potential in the deuteron - nucleus optical model .",
    "searches for such a potential have not been definitive because of interpretive complications arising from the strong coupling to breakup states @xcite .    in this paper , we begin with the @xmath0-matrix described in ref .  @xcite",
    ". the important features of the calculation of the @xmath0-matrix elements are reviewed in section  ii . in order to use this effective interaction in distorted - wave calculations with presently available computer programs ,",
    "we must transform the @xmath0-matrix elements to a coordinate - space representation using a sum of yukawa functions . in ref .",
    "@xcite these coefficients in the yukawa expansion are fit directly to the values of the @xmath0-matrix elements .",
    "this is equivalent to earlier methods in which the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitudes were calculated as a function of scattering angle or momentum transfer and then the yukawa expansion ranges and coefficients were chosen to best reproduce these angular distributions @xcite . for technical reasons",
    ", we will follow the second scheme here ( see section iii ) . in the process",
    ", we will introduce a multipole expansion of the new @xmath0-matrix elements in which the lowest order recovers the result for a spherical pauli blocking operator .",
    "for the spherical pauli operator , a comparison of the two methods shows practically identical answers .    in section iv we will compare the non - spherical and spherical treatments of the pauli blocking operator for representative nuclear transitions at 100 and 200  mev .",
    "we will include a comparison to the free , or density - independent , effective interaction and to an effective interaction that also contains relativistic effects .",
    "these comparisons will help gauge the importance of the non - spherical treatment of pauli blocking relative to density - dependent effects more typically included .",
    "we will also include measurements of the cross section and analyzing power to illustrate these effects in relation to the quality of the reproduction of the data .",
    "pauli blocking has its largest effects on the isoscalar central and spin - orbit terms in the effective interaction .",
    "these terms are well tested by a comparison to elastic proton scattering or transitions to natural - parity excited states .",
    "pauli blocking is only one process that is important in the calculation of the effective interaction in the nuclear medium .",
    "others , such as the effects of strong relativistic mean fields @xcite and coupling to @xmath11-resonances @xcite , increase the repulsion in the nuclear medium just as does pauli blocking @xcite . in a complete treatment , these should be properly considered , along with the attraction expected to arise from many - body forces .",
    "thus a set of calculations based on the conventional brueckner - hartree - fock approach to nuclear matter only ( such as those we present here ) , should not be expected to provide the final answer . however , a critical evaluation of any of these medium effects requires that the treatment of pauli blocking not introduce systematic errors large enough to affect our interpretation when agreement with data is considered .",
    "we will show that at intermediate energies the inclusion of non - spherical components in the blocking operator produces changes that are modest in size compared to the main density - dependent effects typically included in the effective interaction .",
    "the brueckner - bethe - goldstone equation @xcite describes the scattering of two nucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "the presence of the ( infinite ) nuclear medium is included through pauli blocking and a mean field arising from the interactions with all the other nucleons .",
    "it is convenient to express the momenta of the two nucleons , @xmath12 for the projectile and @xmath13 for the struck nucleon , in terms of the relative and center - of - mass motion as the total or center - of - mass momentum * p * is conserved in the scattering process .    in analogy with free - space scattering ,",
    "the nuclear matter bethe - goldstone equation is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two - body potential .",
    "the energy of the two - particle system , @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 its initial value ) , includes kinetic energy and the potential energy generated by the mean field .",
    "the latter is determined in a separate self - consistent calculation of nuclear matter properties and is conveniently parametrized in terms of effective masses [ 5 ] . at this point the direction and magnitude of * p *",
    "have not been specified .",
    "the pauli projection operator @xmath18 selects intermediate states where both nucleon momenta lie above the fermi momentum @xmath19 : @xmath20 visualizing the ( sharp ) fermi surface as a sphere of radius @xmath19 , the condition above imposes the requirement that the tips of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 vectors lie outside the sphere . for applications",
    "to real nuclei , @xmath19 is treated as a function of the local nuclear density @xmath21    the matrix elements for the non - spherical pauli operator may be written in a partial wave basis as where @xmath22 the step functions destroy the orthogonality that would otherwise exist for the spherical harmonics in the integral .",

    "however , the @xmath6-dependence decreases with increasing @xmath7 @xcite and we were able to ignore these effects on partial waves with @xmath47 , which were calculated using the usual angle - average approximation .    in general , the new elements of the @xmath0-matrix will introduce spin operators that depend on the direction of @xmath23 , the sum of the projectile momentum @xmath12 and the momentum @xmath13 of the particle encountered in the nuclear medium . for practical reasons it is desirable that @xmath23 be fixed for a particular transition and incident energy .",
    "at the intermediate energies of interest here , when the incident laboratory momentum can be considered large compared with the momenta of the target nucleons , a natural approximation for @xmath23 is @xmath12 .",
    "we shall show however that this is not a good choice here because it leads to a g - matrix which can not be expressed in terms of the standard set of spin operators ( for example , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , where the momentum transfer @xmath52 and the normal to the scattering plane @xmath53 establish a coordinate system with @xmath54 ) .",

    "a calculation of proton elastic or inelastic scattering observables using presently available computer programs requires that the information on the nn interaction in the medium carried by the @xmath0-matrix elements be converted into the amplitudes of the effective nn interaction .",

    "( 15 ) are anti - symmetrized by subtracting in each case the same amplitude with the additional phase factor @xmath179 and with * k * replaced by @xmath180*k*. this requires that any value of @xmath8 that appears in a partial wave decomposition of @xmath119 satisfies @xmath181 .    the direction of * p * , the total momentum of the colliding nucleons defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , remains the same for both terms in the anti - symmetrization subtraction . if we consider just the amplitudes associated with the tensor spin operators @xmath182 and @xmath51 , then in terms of the unsymmetrized amplitudes @xmath183 : @xmath184 where the dot products indicate any scalar generated with the vector * p*. the amplitude to be subtracted is note that the definition of the scattering angle becomes the complement of the original value . with the reversal of the direction of * k * , the vectors * q * and * q * have interchanged places and magnitudes while * p * remains fixed .",
    "thus , the direction of @xmath185 reverses .",
    "for nn scattering , the anti - symmetrized amplitudes satisfy @xcite @xmath187 this permits the same yukawa expansion coefficients to be used for @xmath188 and @xmath121 provided that @xmath18 is used in place of @xmath189 in the yukawa expansion of the @xmath80 term @xcite . for the non - spherical calculations used in this paper , * p * is along the direction of @xmath190 , thus the dot products involving * q * in eqs .",
    "( 52 ) and ( 53 ) remain . due to the presence of different arguments in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 amplitudes , eq .  ( 54 ) is not necessarily satisfied .",
