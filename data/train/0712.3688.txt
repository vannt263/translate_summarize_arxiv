    "this approach allows one to perform computations of certain integrals with respect to an ill - defined measure on surfaces , by approximating them by finite sums over maps . from a mathematical perspective",
    ", this leads to the stimulating problem of existence of a measure on compact surfaces arising as the scaling limit of , say , uniform random triangulations of the sphere ( or the compact orientable surface of genus @xmath0 ) with a large number of faces .",
    "important progress has been made in this direction in the recent years , thanks to bijective approaches initiated in schaeffer s thesis @xcite .",
    "they allowed chassaing & schaeffer @xcite to obtain the scaling limits for the radius and profile of a uniform rooted planar quadrangulation with @xmath1 faces , considered as a metric space by endowing its vertices with the usual graph distance . in particular , they showed that typical graph distances between vertices of such random quadrangulations are of order @xmath2 .",
    "generalizations of this result have been obtained for much more general families of random maps by marckert , weill and the author in @xcite , relying on generalizations of schaeffer s bijection by bouttier , di francesco & guitter @xcite .",
    "an important step has been accomplished by le gall @xcite , who showed that scaling limits of these random quadrangulations , considered in the gromov - hausdorff sense @xcite , must be homeomorphic to a metric quotient of the so - called brownian continuum random tree of aldous @xcite .",
    "this random quotient was introduced under the name of _ brownian map _ by marckert & mokkadem @xcite , who proved convergence of random quadrangulations towards this limit in a sense yet different from convergence in distribution in the gromov - hausdorff topology .",
    "subsequently , le gall & paulin @xcite inferred that the brownian map is homeomorphic to the two - dimensional sphere . at the present stage , it is however not known whether the scaling limit is uniquely determined as the brownian map , which would lead to a satisfactory answer to the above mentioned problem .",
    "a natural idea is to characterize the limit through its `` finite - dimensional marginal distributions '' . from the point of view of metric measure spaces",
    ", this would mean to characterize the laws of mutual distances between an arbitrary number of randomly sampled points .",
    "this , however , seems hard to obtain .",
    "the approach of the present work , which deals with combinatorial , probabilistic and geometric aspects of maps , was initially motivated by another notion of finite - dimensional marginals , which takes into account the planar structure of the graphs that are considered , and roughly consists in studying the voronoi tessellation on the map with sources taken at random .",
    "our central combinatorial result is a natural generalization of schaeffer s bijective construction , to be introduced in section [ sec : coding - delay - voron ] .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to the planar case , as the most natural framework is to consider maps of arbitrary ( but fixed ) genus @xmath0 , so our bijection is really a generalized version of the marcus - schaeffer bijection in arbitrary genus @xcite .",
    "let us explain briefly the idea of our construction .",
    "recall that the marcus - schaeffer bijection encodes a genus-@xmath0 bipartite quadrangulation with a distinguished vertex by a labeled map of genus @xmath0 with one face , in such a way that the labels keep track of graph distances to the distinguished vertex in the quadrangulation .",
    "our construction encodes a genus-@xmath0 bipartite quadrangulation with @xmath3 distinguished vertices by a labeled map of genus @xmath0 with @xmath3 faces ( theorem [ bij ] and corollary [ sec : rooting-1 ] ) . in some sense ,",
    "the faces of the encoding map correspond to the voronoi tiles in the quadrangulation , with sources at the @xmath3 distinguished vertices , and the labels allow to keep track of graph distance of a vertex to the source of the voronoi tile it belongs to .",
    "an important fact is that there is some flexibility in the construction , allowing one to consider a generalized voronoi tessellation in which the distances to the @xmath3 sources are measured after addition of a _ delay _ depending on the source .",
    "the resulting set of labeled maps with a fixed number of faces is combinatorially much simpler than that of bipartite quadrangulations , and we are able to study their scaling limits .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : discr - cont - path ] ( theorem [ sec : cont - meas - label-1 ] and propositions [ sec : exceptional - cases-1 ] , [ sec : exceptional - cases-2 ] ) , after showing how to encode labeled maps by appropriate processes in section [ sec : struct - label - maps ] .",
    "sections [ sec : appl - asympt - enum ] and [ sec : proof - main - results ] give three applications of these scaling limit results for labeled maps , to combinatorial and geometric properties of bipartite quadrangulations    the first application is a new derivation of known asymptotic enumeration results ( theorem [ sec : main - results ] ) , to which the short section [ sec : appl - asympt - enum ] is devoted .",

    "* proposition 1 ) .",
    "] by recursive decomposition methods , of a very different nature from our bijective study .",
    "these results have also been obtained in the recent work of chapuy , marcus & schaeffer @xcite , who completed the exact enumeration of maps of genus @xmath0 that was initiated in @xcite .",

    "our other results concern the metric structure of randomly sampled bipartite quadrangulations .",

    "most the articles on the topic have focused on scaling limits as @xmath5 of random families of maps conditioned to have @xmath1 faces or @xmath1 vertices .",
    "we prefer to randomize the number of faces , by using natural @xmath6-finite measures on bipartite quadrangulations of fixed genus @xmath0 , called the boltzmann measures @xmath7 ( the term being inspired from @xcite , see also @xcite ) , and which are obtained by assigning an appropriate weight to the faces .",
    "in the physics terminology , these measures correspond to the so - called _ grand - canonical _ measures , while the measures with fixed number of faces are the _ microcanonical _ measures .",
    "these measures are used to define natural `` boltzmann - gibbs '' distributions on quadrangulations , depending on an inverse temperature parameter @xmath8 that allows one to tune the average size of the quadrangulation and take scaling limits .    the existence of these scaling limits , considered with respect to the gromov - hausdorff - prokhorov topology on metric measure spaces , and stated in theorem [ sec : mains - results-1 ]",
    ", is then obtained from the study of section [ sec : discr - cont - path ] .",
    "this generalizes to arbitrary genera the fact that planar quadrangulations admit scaling limits for the gromov - hausdorff topology , as shown in le gall @xcite .",
    "the theory of metrics on weighted metric spaces that is needed here is developed in section [ sec : grom - hausd - weight ] .",
    "the main result of the present paper , theorem [ sec : mains - results-2 ] , gives qualitative information on the metric structure of the scaling limits of random bipartite quadrangulations .",
    "we show that these scaling limits are geodesic weighted metric spaces , in which two typical points are linked by a unique geodesic .",
    "the idea is to use our bijection for quadrangulations with @xmath9 marked vertices , in order to show that , if @xmath10 are typical points in the limiting random metric space @xmath11 arising as a scaling limit of random bipartite quadrangulations , the intersection of a geodesic between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and a geometric locus of the form @xmath14\\ , , \\ ] ] is a.s .  reduced to a single point .",
    "theorem [ sec : mains - results-2 ] is strongly reminiscent of the combinatorial results of the recent paper by bouttier & guitter @xcite .",
    "they show that in the planar case @xmath15 , two typical vertices in a random quadrangulation with @xmath1 faces can not be linked by two geodesics which are `` very far '' in the scale @xmath2 , as @xmath5 .",
    "our result confirms that geodesics between typical points become unique in the scaling limit , answering one of the questions raised in section 5 of @xcite , though in our slightly different setting of boltzmann - distributed maps .",
