    "in 1942 , k. menger thought that the distance between two points in a real space is random and so he presented a probabilistic generalization of a classical metric space , namely the notion of a probabilistic metric space ( briefly , a @xmath4 space ) in which the distance between two points is described by a probability distribution function .",
    "subsequently , the theory of @xmath4 spaces was founded and deeply developed by b. schweizer and a. sklar @xcite .",
    "following k. menger s idea , a. n. serstnev presented the notion of a probabilistic normed space ( briefly , a @xmath5 space ) in 1962 , then in 1993 c. alsina , b. schweizer and a. sklar redefined @xmath5 spaces in a more general way in @xcite and in 1997 they and c. sempi presented the notion of a probabilistic inner product space ( briefly , a @xmath6 space ) in @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 spaces are usually endowed with a natural topology , called the @xmath7-topology , so that they are metrizable linear topological spaces under a mild condition @xcite , see @xcite for the closely related studies of @xmath5 spaces . since @xmath5 spaces are rarely locally convex spaces , for example , menger @xmath5 spaces under a @xmath8-norm other than the @xmath8-norm min are not locally convex spaces in general , even they do not admit a nontrival continuous linear functional , and so the theory of traditional conjugate spaces universally fails to serve for the deep development of @xmath5 spaces . considering the fundamental importance of the theory of traditional conjugate spaces in functional analysis ,",
    "a natural problem is : whether does there exist a proper probabilistic generalization of the theory of traditional conjugate spaces which perfectly matches the theory of general @xmath5 spaces ? as stated in @xcite , this problem is still an open and challenging problem .",
    "actually , in the last 15 years the development of random metric theory is closely related to this problem , in fact , this problem has been satisfactorily solved within random metric theory @xcite .",
    "random metric theory originated from the theory of probabilistic metric spaces .",
    "the random distance between two points in an original random metric space ( briefly , an @xmath9 space ) is a nonnegative random variable defined on some probability space ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) , similarly , the random norm of a vector in an original random normed space ( briefly , an @xmath10 space ) is a nonnegative random variable defined on some probability space ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 15 ) .",
    "the development of @xmath10 spaces in the direction of functional analysis led us to present the new versions of an @xmath9 and @xmath10 space in @xcite , where the random distances or random norms are defined to be the equivalence classes of nonnegative random variables according to the new versions .",
    "since an @xmath10 space under the @xmath7-topology is not a locally convex space in general , the theory of traditional conjugate spaces universally fails to serve for the theory of @xmath10 spaces .",
    "based on the new version of an @xmath10 space we presented a definitive definition of the random conjugate space for an @xmath10 space , further the deep development of the theory of random conjugate spaces led us to present the notion of a random normed module ( briefly , an @xmath10 module ) in @xcite , which is the elaboration of the notion of the original @xmath10 module introduced in @xcite . with the notions of @xmath10 modules and their random conjugate spaces at hand ,",
    "we have developed deeply and systematically the theory of @xmath10 modules under the @xmath7-topology @xcite .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is : some classical theorems such as the riesz s representation theorem in hilbert spaces and the james theorem in banach spaces still hold in complete random inner product modules ( briefly , @xmath11 modules ) and complete @xmath10 modules , respectively @xcite , whereas the others such as the classical banach - alaoglu theorem and banach - bourbaki - kakutani-@xmath12mulian theorem do not universally hold in our random setting @xcite .",
    "the classical helly theorem @xcite , as one of the basic theorems in functional analysis , is a powerful tool for the study of a system of linear functional equations , which says that if @xmath13 is a normed space over the scalar field @xmath0 , @xmath14 are any given bounded linear functionals on @xmath13 , @xmath15 are any given constants in @xmath0 and @xmath16 is any given nonnegative number , then for any positive number @xmath17 there exists @xmath18 such that the following conditions are satisfied    \\(1 ) @xmath19 for any @xmath20 such that @xmath21 ,    \\(2 ) @xmath22    if and only if @xmath23 holds for all @xmath24 .",
    "then , does the interesting helly theorem hold in @xmath10 modules under the framework of random conjugate spaces ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an affirmative answer for @xmath10 modules with the countable concatenation property .",
    "the answer to this problem will involve both the algebraic characterization of finitely generated @xmath1-modules ( see theorem [ thm1 ] below ) and the recently developed separation theorem in random locally convex modules under the locally @xmath25-convex topology ( see lemma [ lem6 ] below ) .",
    "the notion of a random locally convex module was first introduced in @xcite and deeply developed under the @xmath7-topology in @xcite for the further development of the theory of @xmath10 modules . in 2009 , motivated by financial applications , filipovi , kupper and vogelpoth presented in @xcite a new topology ( called the locally @xmath25-convex topology ) for a random locally convex module and proved that the theory of a hausdorff locally @xmath25-convex module introduced in @xcite is equivalent to the theory of a random locally convex module endowed with the locally @xmath25-convex topology .",
    "subsequently , the relations between some basic results derived from the two kinds of topologies were studied in @xcite .",
    "now , random locally convex modules and in particular random normed modules together with their random conjugate spaces have been a proper framework for @xmath25-convex analysis playing a crucial role in the study of conditional risk measures @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the @xmath7-topology and the locally @xmath25-convex topology have their respective advantages and disadvantages and they can complement each other in the study of random locally convex modules , for example , the @xmath7-topology is very natural but too weak to ensure that a random locally convex module has even an @xmath25-convex open proper subset , whereas the locally @xmath25-convex topology is too strong but can guarantee that a random locally convex module has rich @xmath25-convex open subsets so that filipovi , kupper and vogelpoth can prove a separation theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.6 ) between the two @xmath25-convex subsets if either of them is open in the locally @xmath25-convex topology , their result was further generalized to a more general form ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.15 ) .",
    "besides a variant of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.15 ) ( see lemma [ lem6 ] below ) , the following key result , namely theorem 1.1 below , concerning the algebraic characterization of the structure of finitely generated @xmath1-modules is in particular crucial in this paper .    to introduce the two main results of this paper ,",
