    "what is the mechanism which allows the pseudo - scalar tpf to avoid the generic exponential @xmath311 fall - off . in this section",
    "we suggest an answer this question .",
    "the key is that the exponential suppression of the various tpf s is due to the strong interactions .",
    "indeed this suppression was `` derived '' above by using the fluctuating phases due to the strong chromo - magnetic fields in the vacuum of the theory induced by the strong non - perturbative interactions . in the free @xmath312 theory",
    "all tpfs @xmath181 in the @xmath28 channel with massless u and d quarks behave as : @xmath313 when @xmath314 with i dependent prefactors and inverse powers of @xmath6 and have no exponential fall - off which is only due to the strongly interacting phases .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism generating a pseudo - scalar two point function @xmath315 with _ no _ exponential asymptotic fall - off and massless pions should involve a particular coherent time evolution with no fluctuating phases and/or flipping of signs of real factors . to see how such a coherent evolution can arise",
    "we need a different variant of the path integrals where we sum over fermionic paths .",
    "we find that self retracting pairs of paths make positive coherent contributions to the ps tpf but _ not _ to any other tpf .",
    "we conjecture that the contribution these paths ( augmented by renormalizations like insertions of side chains which preserve the positivity ) evades the exponential fall - off of @xmath315 .",
    "thus we suggest that massless pions , or more generally massless pseudo - scalar composites of mass - less fermion anti - fermion @xmath316 in underlying confining gauge theories , follow directly from the behavior of the corresponding two point pseudo - scalar function @xmath315 at large distance .",
    "clearly this is consistent with and follows from sxsb manifesting via the @xmath317 condensate in the vacuum since the goldstone modes correspond to small xiral rotations of this condensate .",
    "conversely unless an effective lagrangian with no non - derivative couplings describes the low energy physics of the massless bosons , exhausting all aspects of sxsb , the theory has severe unexpected infra - red ( ir ) divergences .    the following three differences seem to favor the approach which we suggest here to proving sxsb by showing that @xmath315 has no exponential fall - off and hence the pions are massless , over the conventional approach of proving the existence of a @xmath317 condensate .",
    "a. : :    the pion s mass addressed here is the ground state energy in a    particular channel with @xmath35 ( or    @xmath318 ) flavor and @xmath319    spin - parity .",
    "this allows using variational arguments which can not be    as readily applied when discussing the order parameter    @xmath317 .",
    "b. : :    the self retracing fermionic and related paths are chosen here by the    positivity of their contribution to the pseudo - scalar two point    function which may allow putting rigorous lower bound on the value of    the ps tpf . c. : :    the two points x and y singled out here along the closed fermionic    loop allow using the distance @xmath320 as an important    additional control parameter .",
    "in the strong coupling limit on the lattice only self - retracing fermionic configurations survive by avoiding excessive oscillating non abelian wilson loop phases .",
    "thus the strong coupling limit featured in earlier efforts to prove sxsb used one loop diagrams shrunk into self retracing parts .",
    "the interplay between the present and these works will be an important theme in our discussions    due to many reasons which will become clear in the following we do _ not _ prove sxsb in qcd and similar vectorial gauge theories with massless fermions .",
    "while several heuristic arguments tend to support our conjecture that the self - retracing fermionic and related paths account for massless pions , much more effort and far more careful analytic treatment is required before a proof obtains or one will find that our conjecture is wrong .",
    "the sum over paths is equivalent to the `` hopping parameter '' expansion @xcite and is least convergent in the limit considered here where the bare quark masses approach zero .",
    "further to maintain exact xiral symmetry , crucial for the massless pions , and still avoid fermion doubling we need `` overlap '' or `` domain wall '' fermions @xcite , @xcite@xcite,@xcite . while we ignored these important issues ,",
    "the positivity of the contribution to the pseudo - scalar two point function of the sr paths- the microscopic path by path version of the positivity of the integrand in the standard path integral underlying the``standard '' qcd inequalities- is likely to survive .",
    "being the key to most of the following we hope that the qualitatively features it suggests are indeed correct .",
    "our main motivation for considering this approach to sxsb in qcd is not to prove sxsb ( which in the large @xmath3 limit considered has already been proved by coleman and witten@xcite but the new 125 gev scalar discovered at the lhc .",
    "if in any vectorial theory the lowest pseudo - scalar bound states of massless fermion and anti - fermion are massless whereas the scalars have masses of the order of the scale of the theory then such theories are unlikely likely to generate a pgnb 125 scalar . for this",
    "we do not have to show that the @xmath321 pseudo - scalars are massless .",
    "rather it suffices to show that in the above theories mass difference between the lightest scalar and the lightest pseudo - scalar which are made of massless fermion - antifermion is substantial- of order @xmath38 which for the case at hand is @xmath322    in most formal treatments and also in numerical monte - carlo simulations the full fermionic propagators in a given background field are used and the gauge field configurations are summed over only at the end .",
    "this procedure is natural as the lagrangian is bilinear in the fermions .",
    "here we use the reverse order of first summing over all gauge configurations for a given fermionic path p of a u quark going from x to y and a path p of @xmath4 from y to x , and then performing the sum over all pairs of such paths .    as illustrated in fig  [ slide15 ]     quark paths @xmath157 and down - ward going",
    "@xmath47 anti - quark paths @xmath323 denoted by full and broken lines respectively . ]",
    "we break the complete u or @xmath4 propagators between points x and y into the contribution of fermionic paths and pair them off into a double sum over closed loops made of the path p of an upward moving u quark and the reversed path p of a down - ward moving @xmath4 quark . after summing over the gauge configurations with the appropriate weight , which includes the determinants for quarks other than the u and d quarks of interest , we obtain for each pair of fermion paths a gauge invariant wilson loop``color '' factor @xmath324 .",
    "we note that the sum over the paths of the massless @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks ( which also serve as alias for the @xmath325 and @xmath326 in the general case of interest ) is not modified via pauli blocking or possible annihilation due to loops of the other , non u or d , light flavors and these loops manifest only via the above determinants .",
    "this is not the case for loops of the u and d quarks of interest which do affect the sum over paths considered here via pauli blocking .",
    "all loops are avoided here simply by using the large n(c ) limit .    to better control the path summation and understand the spinor factor @xmath327 associated with each loop we discretize the paths using a four dimensional simple cubic lattice with vertices labeled by @xmath328 with links @xmath329 emanating from each vertex along the four axes .",
    "paths @xmath157 connecting @xmath330 and @xmath331 consist of contiguous links starting at @xmath330 and terminating at @xmath331 .",
    "the contribution @xmath332 of each path to the full fermion propagator @xmath333 is the ordered product over the links of the gauge group connections @xmath334 and of the spinorial parts @xmath335 associated with each link :    @xmath336    the real , positive coefficients a and b in the spinor factor are fixed by the bare masses of the quarks , the lattice spacing and by the scheme used for putting the fermions on the lattice . for wilson fermions @xmath337 and for kogut - susskind `` naive '' fermions we have only the @xmath338 part which corresponds to the @xmath339 in the numerator of the configuration space massless free fermion propagator .",

    "the great advantage ( or draw - back- depending on one s point of view  ) of such theories is that the path integral expressing all the n point euclidean functions and in particular the tpfs -two point function which determine the spectrum of the theory has a _ positive _ measure .",

    "most susy and xiral models which have been the focus of interest in recent years do _ not _ have a positive path integral measure and did not , so far , allowed a consistent lattice discretization .",

    "because of the spontaneous breaking of ew symmetry the composite @xmath9 state could mix with a pure `` glue - ball like '' @xmath9 state , a composite of the gauge bosons of the underlying confining group and such a mixing could in principle reduce it s energy . while this is a remote possibility in confining gauge theories",
    "suggests that the lowest glueball mass is high .",
    "while we should not take the case of qcd too literally , both lattice calculations and the lack of experimental evidence suggest that @xmath565 with @xmath566 so that a scalar of mass @xmath567 is unlikely to strongly mix with it . in the case of the ninth pseudoscalar that strong mixing dramatically increased the mass of @xmath568 to   @xmath569 a mass which stems from the axial u(1 ) anomaly breaking the conservation of the ninth axial current . in view of the heavy gb masses in the @xmath9 and in the @xmath563 channels we can ( @xcite ) ,",
    "describe the propagation between the distant x and y in the scalar and pseudo - scalar tpf s as proceeding most of the time via fermionic loops connected by effective four fermion couplings generated via the exchange of the heavy gb states over relatively short distances .",
    "summing the resulting geometric series in momentum space tends to yield higher masses than for the case when no annihilation is possible .",

    "the large @xmath570 limit is very important in several ways : it allows confinement even of light dynamical fermions , it is implicit in the qcd mass inequalities and the proof by coleman and witten , @xcite of sxsb by using axial anomaly matching arguments and all other arguments for sxsb including the one we presented in sec vi above do rely on this limit .    to show ( or argue ) that the scalar is heavier than the pseudoscalar by the `` scale of the theory '' we need that the vectorial theory with the mass - less fermions in question will indeed have a scale in the first place .",

    "theory confines the fermions @xmath571 .",
    "specifically the large planar wilson loops satisfy the area law .",
    "furthermore we assume that the confinement arises via the `` inverse meissner effect '' that is by having strong chromo - magnetic b field fluctuations in the vacuum .",
    "the substantial difference between the mass @xmath567 of the scalar and the massless pseudo - scalars can then be shown by :    a ) : :    `` proving '' that assumptions v and v above cause all particles in the    theory to have generic masses of order @xmath38 b ) : :    recalling that thanks to the sxsb the pseudoscalars in the    @xmath571 channel remain massless goldstone bosons .",
    "we attempted to motivate point ( a ) in sec v above and in sec vi speculated on the mechanism which allow the ps tpf to evade the generic @xmath572}$ ] asymptotic fall off of all other tpf s .",
    "we are sure that notwithstanding the simplistic and crude nature of the arguments of sec v the result claimed there is indeed correct and can be rigorously proven .",
    "this is certainly not the case for our novel conjecture that a specific slightly augmented set of self - retracing paths is responsible for the fact that the ps tpf @xmath315 has no exponential fall .",
    "our arguments there are at best incomplete but we hope to improve those soon @xcite .",
    "if correct this conjecture would provide new useful insight into the dynamics of sxsb and has applications in qcd phenomenology .",
    "we should however re - emphasize that it is _ not _ essential for our main point that vectorial gauge theories at a high scale are unlikely to produce a light , scalar , composite higgs .",
    "in discussing possible implications of the present paper for composite higgs models based on vectorial underlying gauge interactions we will focus on two main classes of models which broadly speaking we refer to as ( extended ) technicolor and generalized `` little higgs '' type models .",
    "the idea that spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance yields a low mass pseudo goldstone dilaton has been recently revived ( for details and many references see @xcite ) . indeed apart from the effects of the higgs the s.m . with massless gauge bosons and massless fermions",
    "is conformal @xcite and in certain models with scalars @xmath573 with dimension - less couplings respecting conformal invariance @xcite the latter can spontaneously break yielding a massless ( or a very light ) dilaton .",
    "dilaton mass and couplings were discussed in e.g. @xcite and an analysis in the context of light higgs @xcite was recently done .",
    "all these are of great interest but the question addressed are different from ours , namely whether @xmath574 composite light scalars can naturally account for the h(125 ) scalar .",
    "it may seem that there is no difficulty in achieving this .",
    "in particular in extended , `` walking '' , technicolor the number of technicolors and of flavors of the technifermions can be tuned so as to almost yields an infrared fixed point ( with vanishing beta function ) at @xmath575 and a corresponding conformal theory . however it is argued that if at @xmath576 a techniquark antitechniquark @xmath577 condensate with @xmath578 forms , providing the requisite e.w .",
    "ssb , it spontaneously breaks also the almost exact conformal invariance and a scalar pseudo n.g dilaton may arise .",
    "a proper choice of fermionic representations can radically change the theory and in particular can make it almost conformal .",
    "but as noted in the preceding section if the scale of the theory defined by its lightest non - goldstone particles is high , then regardless of any fancy theoretical setting , the difficulty of generating light scalars may persist .    in addressing the above models and the other class bellow",
    "the following general considerations are useful . in gauge theories with fermions but with no fundamental scalars",
    "we are much more limited in choosing spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) patterns than in theories with fundamental scalars - including the minimal s.m .",
    "higgs , where tuning the tachyonic mass and the quartic coupling fix the higgs mass and vev .",
    "no matter how hard we try to `` induce '' the pure vectorial gauge theories to produce a desired pattern of ssb the theory may fail to oblige .",
    "the ssb of non - abelian grand unified gauge theory or of other gauge theories to the gauge group(s ) of the standard model , directly or via some intermediate stages and or breaking of l - r symmetric models to he diagonal or left parts are relevant examples .",
    "the theorem @xcite that local gauge invariance does not spontaneously break , was overcome by the complementarity approach @xcite .",
    "however , the control parameters available in purely vectorial theories namely the choice of the fermionic representations , may be insufficient to achieve the desired s.b pattern .",
    "this difficulty readily overcome by adding generalized higgs fields @xmath579 .",
    "with appropriate @xmath580 quadratic terms and a quartic @xmath581 interactions subject to the requirement of symmetry under the gauged and global `` flavor '' symmetries , we can achieve almost any desired pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "space where @xmath582 .",
    "if however the desired manifold of local minimum of @xmath583 is separated from these `` run - away '' regions by a sufficiently extended and high barrier in @xmath584 space the metastable vacuum can tunnel out only on super cosmological times .",
    "[ footnote : higgs potential positivity constraints ] ]    the above considerations are most readily applied to dynamical e.w . breaking qcd like schemes such as technicolor",
    "in which the sxsb directly yields the massless pseudoscalar goldstone bosons eaten by the w and z and where light higgs were not expected until the more recent techni - dilaton constructs .",
    "the applicability to the rather different compositeness scenarios such as `` little higgs '' and related models @xcite is not as obvious but we still believe that also here it may be difficult to menage without introducing some fundamental scalars and/or some axial gauge interactions",
    ".    models of this type were originally introduced by kaplan and georgi and collaborators @xcite .",
    "a key element is the separation between a high `` compositeness '' scale where an original strong gauged group and an extended flavor symmetry of the confined fermions partially break , and the e.w symmetry breaking at the `` low '' @xmath585 which is dynamically generated via some slight `` vaccuum misalignment '' induced by some other competing gauge interaction .",
    "the lightness of the ew and higgs masses are protected by having _ all _ light bosons pngb s initially pseudo - scalar essentially massless bound state in the underlying theory at a higher scale .",
    "however that as long as all the gauge interactions those at the higher scale and the ones which persist at the lower scale and the gauged flavor groups are are vectorial the whole arsenal of the qcd inequalities and the vafa witten bound are still applicable .",
    "more specifically we note that :    for any additional gauge group of a direct product form we need to multiply the measure by another @xmath586})$ ] positive factor and replace @xmath587 by @xmath588 the dirac operator in the presence of both gauge fields ( see e.g the proof in @xcite that @xmath589 ) . thus having any direct product structure of various gauge groups at different scales and strengths",
    "does not circumvent the difficulty of having light composite scalars made of fermion and anti - fermions in vectorial gauge theories .",
    "completion using renormalizable non - abelian gauge interactions .",
    "we must close the algebra by completing the system to one or several mutually commuting but otherwise complete gauge groups .",
    "[ footnote : not x product form ggs ] ]    if in the process of breaking the symmetry at the high scale one generates massive fermions -which are practically elementary at the lower scale - the vafa - witten bound forbids binding them into light composites by vectorial interactions .",
    "when a large symmetry group @xmath590 say @xmath591 breaks down to @xmath592 say say @xmath593 at some high scale @xmath594 the @xmath595 off - diagonal , broken generators correspond to massive vector bosons .",
    "their exchange mixes fermions which transform under one of the unbroken groups or the other and vice versa can be represented via effective four fermi couplings - and in principle might generate some low lying scalar states .",
    "however failing by the arguments given above to achieve such binding in the original unbroken big group with @xmath596 massless bosons one may wonder why having less than half of them massive with corresponding short range interactions will enable doing it .    repeating the heuristic argument that , due to the repulsive self interactions , turning on a gauge interaction and exchanging vector bosons between a fermion @xmath224 and an anti - fermion @xmath597 of bare masses @xmath526 and @xmath598 _ raise _ the mass of the system above @xmath599 for the case of massive vector bosons is very instructive .",
    "we find that the net effect of self and mutual interactions is still to raise the energy of the system above the bare mass threshold- namely @xmath600 $ ] is still positive but due to weakened attraction less so than in the case of massless gauge bosons .",
    "if gauge vector bosons mass were generated by a higgs mechanism there is a very suggestive interpretation of this result : along - side the vectorial exchange we exchange also the massless scalars which as noted above are attractive and in general they may well break the vafa witten bound and allow arbitrarily strong binding of the fermion anti - fermion system .",
    "however if the effect is subsumed by having just massive vectors this bound and all the other difficulties we pointed out may persist .    to motivate this in a different way",
    "let us introduce the masses of the vector mesons by hand by adding to the euclidean path integral ym action the term @xmath601 .",
    "this is problematic from the point of view of gauge invariance and renormalizability .",
    "still it is less problematic than the local four fermi interactions and in the spirit of effective lagrangian may be fine . for our purpose",
    "we note that adding this term does not affect the measure positivity and all our results may apply here too .    when @xmath602 _ all _ planar diagrams , also those with many fermionic loop,@xcite need to be retained .",
    "even if not at or near the conformal point with the infrared zero of @xmath176 function- the suggested dilaton `` escape route '' it may allow certain composite scenarios to avoid the basic difficulty pointed here . thus having many @xmath603 ng bosons one may wonder if the effective low anergy xiral lagrangian describing them can in fact generate a light scalar- the @xmath0 higgs particle in the case at hand - as a bound state of some combination of ngb s pairs .",
    "while this may happen we believe that it is rather unlikely in general and for the case at hand in particular .",
    "it is hard to conceive of the 125 higgs particle being a bound state coupling to a pair of @xmath554s without some anomaly near the ww threshold and without an enhanced @xmath604 decay . at large",
    "nf we are likely to have many more massless ng particles for which there is no indication at the lhc@xcite .    in general large departures from pure vectorial models  such as a purely xiral gauge theory or a large @xmath605 term",
    "do break as shown above measure positivity .",
    "however unlike analyticity , positivity and the various inequalities derived using it are robust- and may not be affected by adding small `` positivity violating '' terms to the lagrangian .",
    "thus consider the modifications ( a ) @xmath606/2+i\\theta(e.b)$ ] in the pure gauge part of the lagrangian or ( b ) @xmath607 in the fermionic part .",
    "if @xmath608 is small then in order to generate significant oscillations or phase in @xmath609}$ ] we need that the integral of @xmath610 over some region r of interest be significant say @xmath611 but than the integral of @xmath606 $ ] over this region exceeds @xmath612 dramatically suppressing it s contribution by more than @xmath613}$ ] .",
    "the gauge field configurations maximizing the oscillatory effects are the pure ( anti-)instanton configurations for which the field is ( anti ) self - dual i.e. @xmath614 in which case we have precisely the above suppression which is indeed minimal when @xmath608 has it s maximal value @xmath615 .",
    "likewise the effect of adding an axial current to the interacting vector current becomes maximal for chiral theories when @xmath616 .",
    "thus there seems to be an annoying ( ! ) complementarity that when the `` elegant '' purely xiral , purely instanton physics prevails positivity is maximally violated .",
    "to better understand dynamical theories which potentially generate the observed 125 gev @xmath9 as a bound state , we revisited confining vectorial theories with massless quarks / fermions .",
    "our main objective was to understand by studying the euclidean two point functions of bilinears of the above fermions at large separations why the lightest pseudo - scalars are massless or very light whereas the @xmath9 scalars have the o(tev ) mass scale of the theory . under a very specific set of assumptions including that the scale of the new compositeness physics is high ,",
    "o(tev ) , we therefore find that vectorial gauge theories are unable or unlikely to produce scalars as light as the @xmath617 gev @xmath9 as a fermion - antifermion bound state .",
    "within string theory and string / brane inspired extra - dimensions the question posed here wether the h(125 ) particle elementary or composite may be mute .",
    "we can have elementary , weakly coupled , `` electrical '' charges and highly composite magnetic monopoles ( consisting of @xmath618 bosons @xcite ) with a reversed situation in a dual phase .",
    "also in theories with extra dimensions compositeness may become relative and we could have various degrees of compositeness depending on the distance in the extra dimensions to some brane .",
    "still we believe that the study we undertook here of the prospects of composite h(125 ) particle in local vectorial gauge field theories is worth - while .",
    "while it suggests that many such models will not work trying to evade our `` pseudo no - go theorem '' may restrict the model building in a useful way and help point out to the correct alternative- be it an elementary or composite h(125 ) particle .",
    "we have actually hinted at some such possibility by noting that a light fermion- light fermion ( rather than fermion -anti - fermion ) with the fermions transforming as real representations of the confining gauge group form a light _",
    "scalars_. related example involve @xmath619 @xcite or other @xcite flavor groups .",
    "such schemes may require mixings between composite higher scale baryons and fundamental quarks@xcite .",
    "finally , finding at the lhc a relatively light compositeness scale or near - by opposite - parity higgs particle will clearly ameliorate all the issues brought up here .",
    "the second part of our paper is devoted to a conjecture on a path integral mechanism for massless pions and sxsb in qcd and vectorial theories in general .",
    "we suggested that self - retracing paths and a slightly extended class of similar paths dominate the ps tpf and generate massless pseudoscalars in the @xmath620 limit .",
    "eventually this may lead to an independent proof of massless pions and sxsb in qcd and in vectorial theories in general . in the large @xmath3 limit adopted here the argument of @xcite using axial anomaly matching or equivalently the baryon meson mass inequality in large @xmath3 ,",
    "do prove that the pions are massless .",
    "thus no proof of sxsb in this limit is needed and none was provided here .",
    "our attempts to understand this using the long distance behavior of the pseudo - scalar two point function are non - the - less a useful complement",
    ".    there may be more direct connections between the various approaches to sxsb and massless pions .",
    "the axial anomaly is related to the peculiar kinematics where a massless pole is generated in the @xmath101 channel when the light - like momenta of the on shell massless fermion and that of the antifermion are parallel .",
    "both the banks - casher criterion for sxsb of having the zero modes of the dirac operator behave as if they were those of a free 1 dim ( where four momenta are always parallel ! ) and our conjectured importance of the contribution to the asymptotic behavior of pseudo - scalar two point function made by self retracing paths with parallel moving fermion and antifermion seem to be intimately related to this .    while inspired by our desire to understand the scalar -pseudoscalar mass difference .",
    "is of interest in its own right and hopefully will be proved ( or disproved ) by stronger mathematical physicists .",

    "this ud spin singlet then forms the @xmath621 color state with a suppressed wilson loop color factor , namely the relatively tightly bound diquark which is a key element of the nqm phenomenology .",
