    "blazars are the radio@xmath1loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that are classified as bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) if they have largely featureless optical spectra or as flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) if they have prominent emission lines .",
    "all blazars are characterized by broadband non - thermal emission extending over the complete electromagnetic spectrum , strong polarization from radio to optical wavelengths , and displays of violent variability on timescales that can extend from a fraction of an hour to many years . in the usual orientation - based unified model of radio@xmath1loud agn",
    ", blazar jets make an angle of @xmath2 10@xmath3 from the line of sight and the emission from these jets is thus doppler boosted and dominates what we observe ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "blazar variability timescales have often been arbitrarily divided into three classes : timescales from a few tens of minutes to less than a day are called intraday variability ( idv ) ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) or micro - variability or intranight variability , those from several days to a few months are short timescale variability ( stv ) , while long timescale variability ( ltv ) covers changes from several months to many years ( gupta et al .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars have two peaks ( e.g. , giommi , ansari & micol 1995 ; fossati et al .",
    "the locations of those peaks can be used to classify blazars into lbls ( low energy peaked blazars ) with the first hump in the near infrared ( nir ) or optical band and the second hump usually peaking at gev @xmath0-ray energies , while hbls ( high energy peaked blazars ) are those with first peak in the uv or x - ray band and the second peak located at up to tev energies ( e.g. , padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "the high polarization of the radio to optical emission suggests that the lower energy peak is produced via the synchrotron process but the high energy emission mechanism in blazars is not yet fully understood , though it is probably due to the inverse compton ( ic ) mechanism .      with its redshift @xmath4 ,",
    "mrk 421 ( b2 1101@xmath5384 ) ( @xmath6=11h 04 m 27.2s and @xmath7=@xmath8 ) is among the closest blazars , at a distance of 134 mpc ( h@xmath9 71 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 0.27 , @xmath12 0.73 ) .",
    "it is classified as an hbl because the energy of its synchrotron peak is higher than 0.1 kev .",

    "we are able to cross - correlate the variability across @xmath0-ray , x - ray and optical bands .",
    "a prominent peak at around jd 2455167 and a short flare near jd 2455170 are seen in both the optical lc and the @xmath0-ray lc ( fig .",

    "we performed a dcf between the @xmath0-ray ( 1 - 300 gev ) flux and the lcs in the optical r - band .",
    "this dcf shows a large peak correlation amplitude of @xmath14 0.90 at @xmath64 days which indicates gamma - ray frequencies are leading the optical frequencies .",
    "we have used monte - carlo simulations to test the strength of the peak correlation amplitude . to do",
    "so we fit the original optical and @xmath0-ray light curves with low order polynomials to extract those trends . from the de - trended lcs , we obtained the underlying probability distributions of the fluctuations . using this probability distribution , we performed random sampling and thereby generated 3000 realizations of a random lc with the underlying statistical properties of the original lc for both the optical and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "next , taking each combination of these randomly generated lcs , we determined their dcfs .",
    "we checked the ability of dcf to find the real time lags .",
    "since the simulated dcfs also gave time lags of 4.5 days , we examined the @xmath65-values at a lag of 4.5 days .",
    "the null hypothesis examined here is that the highest correlation value at the given lag of the actual data is higher than the simulated light curve s dcf at the same time lag .",
    "we found correlation value of 0.70 to be at a @xmath65-value of 0.99 at the time lag of 4.5 days .",
    "hence , our observed correlation amplitude of 0.90 indicates significance well above 0.99",
    ".      we can crudely study the spectral variability of the source through the hardness ratio .",
    "it is defined as either the ratio of counts ( @xmath66 ) or the ratio of the difference and sum of the counts @xmath67 , ( zhang et al .",
    "we use the former definition . in fig .  6",

    "7 shows the same quantity for 3c 454.3 . for mrk 421 , there is no correlation ( @xmath68 with @xmath69 ) between the source hardness ratio and its intensity . for 3c 454.3 , there appears to be a weak correlation ( @xmath70 with @xmath71 ) between source hardness ratio and its intensity .",
    "during our observation period of november 2009 to june 2010 , we monitored mrk 421 for idv in 9 nights , but genuine idv in any of the b , v and r pass - bands was not detected in any night as both @xmath33 and @xmath38 values were always less than the 99% significance levels .",
    "we noticed the existence of significant short - term variability in this blazar from our observations and the source showed a maximum variation in the b band of 0.70 magnitudes .",
    "the total short - term variation detected in our observations in the b , v , and r bands are @xmath14 62% , @xmath14 53% and @xmath14 44% , respectively .",
    "our data do nt show any truly significant color variations in the ( b@xmath1v ) and ( v@xmath1r ) colors .",
    "we monitored 3c 454.3 for idv during 7 nights during november and december 2009 .",
    "we performed @xmath33 and @xmath38-tests and found that 4 of these 7 nights showed genuine idv . to search for any variability timescale , we computed the sf and dcf , but no significant variability timescales were detected .",
    "we noticed the existence of significant short - term variability in this fsrq blazar but could not perform @xmath33 or @xmath38-tests on the whole data - sets as we had only calibrated data from the chilean and japanese telescopes and not the needed data for comparison stars .",
    "so we performed @xmath33- and @xmath38-tests only on the aries data but we calculated variability amplitudes based on the full data - set .",
    "we found short - term variability amplitudes in the b , v , r and i pass - bands to be @xmath14126% , @xmath14125% , @xmath14125% and @xmath1459% , respectivel ; however the last is based on much less data , and so is consistent with the others .",
    "we also find that the colors of 3c 454.3 are redder at brighter levels , supporting the findings of villata et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "several models have been developed to explain idv and short - term variability in radio - loud agns , and most of these can be classified as the shock - in - jet models and accretion - disk - based models ( wagner & witzel 1995 ; ulrich et al .",
    "1997 ; urry & padovani 1995 ; mangalam & wiita 1993 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 and references therein ) . for blazars in the outburst state , both idv and short - term variability",
    "are strongly presumed to be completely dominated by the relativistic jet required in all models of radio - loud agns .",
    "however , idv and short - term variability of blazars in the low state , as well as that of radio - quiet agn , might be explained by models based on instabilities or hot - spots on the accretion disk ( e.g.  mangalam & wiita 1993 ; chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "short - term variations were seen between many nights .",
    "these flux variations can be reasonably explained by models involving relativistic shocks propagating outwards ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ; marscher et al .",
    "the larger flares are expected to be produced by the emergence and motion of a new shock triggered by some strong variation in a physical quantity such as velocity , electron density or magnetic field moving into and through the relativistic jet .",
    "idv reported in the flaring and high states is generally attributed to the shock moving down the inhomogeneous medium in the jet .",
    "non - detection of idv in mrk 421 indicates that the relativistic shock along the jet has neither changed significantly in speed , nor direction with respect to the line of sight nor were any significant non - antisymmetric structures carried outward in the relativistic magnetized jets .    in the x@xmath1ray lc , there are two strong flares , with the first flare essentially coinciding with the flare in the optical band",
    ". flares from the source was reported by isobe et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their 2010 january - february observations from maxi gsc .",
    "the maximum 2 - 10 kev flux in the january and february flares were 120@xmath3010 mcrab and 164@xmath3017 mcrab , respectively , and the latter maximum is the highest among those reported from mrk 421 so far .",
    "also , the maxi gsc spectrum around the maximum of the flares was found to be consistent with a spectral index indicative of synchrotron radiation .",
    "we found that there was a correlation between the optical and x - ray bands ( @xmath72 ) at a negative lag of 9.5@xmath302 days , which indicates variations at the higher frequencies lead those at the lower frequencies .",
    "however , because of the sparse optical data , we can not claim this to be an absolutely convincing correlation .",
    "such a time delay between bands would be naturally produced by the frequency stratification expected in the simplest shock - in - jet model .",
    "this effect occurs when the electrons are energized along a surface ( e.g. , shock front ) and then move away from it at a speed close to @xmath73 as they lose energy via both synchrotron and ic processes ( marscher & gear 1985 ) .",
    "the highest energy electrons will suffer the most severe radiative losses so that they only maintain these high energies and produce high energy photons over short distances .",
    "hence , the highest frequency radiation can be emitted only within a thin sheet behind the shock front .",
    "the thickness of the sheet increases as the frequency decreases until the frequency is so low that radiative losses are negligible across the entire shocked region .",
    "thus , in this standard model a flare caused by a shock spreads across multiple wavebands , but the time - scale of variability can be much shorter at higher frequencies .",
    "the x - ray flux in a shock - induced flare should therefore peak first , followed by the optical and then lower frequencies , whereas the @xmath0-ray flux , if produced by ic scattering from the x - ray ( or euv ) photons could then lead the optical , while if produced from the optical or ir photons , would lag the optical .",
    "the blazar 3c 454.3 was also found in flaring state during november - december 2009 .",
    "the present observations confirmed the presence of fairly significant color variations that support the presence of thermal emission beneath the dominant non - thermal jet .",
    "raiteri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) previously found good evidence for big and little ",
    "blue bumps \" in the sed of 3c 454.3 during periods of low emission .",
    "prominent peaks are seen nearly simultaneously in the optical and @xmath0-ray bands but these features are not seen in the x - ray band .",
    "the dcf of the @xmath0 and optical bands shows a peak correlation amplitude of @xmath140.90 at @xmath74=4.5@xmath301 indicating @xmath0-rays leading the optical rays .",
    "similar behavior was found by bonning et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for the flare in july 2008 .",
    "the correlated optical/@xmath0-ray variability supports the external compton model in which relativistic electrons in the jet radiate radio through uv synchrotron photons and inverse compton scatter ir / optical photons to hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "the lack of correlation seen in the dcf for x - rays with respect to optical / gamma bands can be reasonably understood if the x - rays are coming from low - energy electrons inverse compton scattering external uv photons , rather than higher energy electrons producing synchrotron photons .",
    "these lower energy electrons would vary more slowly and thus plausibly give rise to the relatively stable x - ray emission .",
    "the modest quantity of our data , which allows for the likely identification of just one flare between the optical and @xmath0-ray bands , precludes our attempting to produce more detailed models .",
