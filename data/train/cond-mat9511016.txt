    "one of the most thoroughly explored subjects in all of science is that of thermal relaxation of magnetisation , in magnetic systems of all shapes and sizes .",
    "investigations in this area ( which go back many centuries @xcite ) have revealed many subtleties , and even today there are many unsolved puzzles ( e.g. , the physics of `` magnetic avalanches '' ) .",
    "very recently a whole new set of questions in this area has arisen , with the advent of well - characterised `` nanoscopic '' magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "such structures include `` made - to - order '' magnetic grains , magnetic wires and superlattice arrays , as well as thin films and spin chains .",
    "there are very obvious applications of such nanomagnets in , e.g. , the recording industry , as well as in information transmission and computing .",
    "theoretical activity has been particularly intense on 1-dimensional spin systems @xcite , and on the tunneling and coherence phenomenon which should exist in both grains ( involving `` giant spin '' @xcite dynamics ) and in the dynamics of domain walls @xcite .",
    "both the theory and the experimental activity in the latter field have been reviewed recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on something rather different - the `` quantum relaxation '' of magnetisation that must occur in any small magnetic particle , once thermally - activated relaxation has ceased .",
    "although there does not seem to have been a serious theoretical analysis of such relaxation before , the conventional view has been that it must proceed via a simple tunneling process ( dissipative or otherwise ) .",
    "the picture we shall derive here is more subtle , and contains some rather fascinating new physics .",
    "tunneling is certainly involved ; but we find that what really controls relaxation is the nuclear spin system inside the magnetic particle , often with the help of phonons or electrons .",
    "one can put the result in the following way : the nuclear spins provide the essential `` switch '' that turns on ( or turns off ) the quantum transitions .",
    "as far as we are aware , there has been no previous recognition that nuclei had any role whatsoever to play in magnetic relaxation , despite the enormous number of experiments in this area . nor",
    "do we know of any theoretical analysis of the influence of electrons on magnetic relaxation .",
    "there has certainly been no attempt at a theory dealing with the combined effects of nuclear spins , phonons , and electrons , which is what we do here .",
    "as we shall see , it is impossible to give a realistic analysis without putting them all together .",
    "we shall not try here to address experiments in any detail , for two reasons .",
    "first , each different experimental system has its own idiosyncracies , and we shall see that our theory has many different parameters - it is simply not possible to give detailed results for all possible cases , and we feel that it would be preferable to examine particular systems for which parameters are well known , as test cases .",
    "this we intend to do elsewhere .",
    "second , in most experiments on magnetic grains , the grains are rather close together .",
    "as we shall briefly explain in this paper , this makes it probable that even the low - t relaxation of an experimental ensemble of grains proceeds via dipolar interactions between the grains .    the theory in this paper is closely related to previous work on quantum coherence in magnetic grains @xcite . in that work",
    "a very detailed analysis was given of the way nuclear spins control the dynamics of `` giant spins '' , i.e. , spins with quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "we also analysed the effect of phonons and electrons in `` decohering '' the quantum motion of @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of quantum relaxation is different , in that even if coherence is destroyed , relaxation may still proceed incoherently .",
    "what we shall find is that in the absence of nuclear spins , phonons can not relax @xmath2 in a small biasing field , because they couple too weakly to it ; on the other hand electrons couple so strongly to @xmath2 that they freeze it completely .",
    "the nuclear spins can then _ liberate _ @xmath2 - amusingly , the mechanisms by which they do this are the same as those by which they _ destroy _ the quantum coherent motion of @xmath2 . the bias field @xmath3 acting on @xmath2 , generated by the combined hyperfine fields of all",
    "the nuclei can easily be greater than @xmath4 ( e.g. , for tbfe@xmath5 grains ) , and depending on the size of the grain may be equivalent to an external field from @xmath6 up to well over @xmath7 ! this bias changes with time in a diffusive way , at a rate governed by inter - nuclear dipolar interactions ( in the absence of phonons and electrons ) , and also nuclear spin - phonon or spin - electron interactions , when the latter are present .",
    "every so often , as @xmath8 shunts around , it brings quantum 2 states corresponding to different orientations of @xmath2 into near degeneracy . at this point",
    "the system can tunnel , provided ( a ) the nuclear bias field @xmath9 gives it time to do so coherently , ( b ) the usual dissipative effects of the electrons and phonons are not too destructive .",
    "on the other hand , we shall also see that the nuclear spins can also further _ inhibit _ the relaxation of @xmath2 , at low @xmath10 .",
    "if the nuclear spins are allowed to come to equilibrium , then at temperature below the hyperfine coupling energy , they exert a large negative bias field on @xmath2 , which essentially traps @xmath2 for astronomical times .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath10 and on the nuclear polarisation , the nuclei can enhance or suppress relaxation .",
    "although our purpose in this paper is not to deal with the implications for magnetic technology involving quantum relaxation , we feel we should at least make some remarks here about what they might be .",
    "fig.1 shows the way in which magnetic computer memory elements have decreased exponentially in size in the last 40 years - such plots have figured large in recent discussions of the need for new kinds of computer design , incorporating elements which operate quantum - mechanically . at present computers , as well as magnetic tapes , use elements which behave classically , and are stable over long periods of time .",
    "this stability over decades exists because they are _ big _ - the energy barrier between 2 states of the element , proportional to its size , usually exceeds @xmath11 even at room temperature . the hypothesized `` quantum threshold '' ,",
    "below which tunneling is important even at @xmath12 , is usually supposed to be for grains containing roughly @xmath13 spins , depending on the material involved .",
    "however we shall find that the threshold between stable behaviour and quantum relaxation can be moved around a lot , depending on how the magnetic system is coupled to the nuclear spins , and whether or not it is coupled to electrons .",
    "we shall see that in some cases , one can freeze the dynamics of even microscopic magnetic systems ( containing only 10 spins ) , for times of thousands of years or more .",
    "conversely , we shall see how it is possible for much larger systems ( containing @xmath14 electronic spins or more ) to relax very quickly ( in @xmath15 ) .",
    "these theoretical insights may have some relevance to the design of future nanoscopic magnetic devices .    in",
    "what follows we shall analyse the role of electrons ( section [ sec:2 ] ) , phonons ( section [ sec:3 ] ) , and nuclei ( section [ sec:4 ] ) , acting in isolation on @xmath2 . then",
    "in section [ sec:5 ] we shall put them together , to give the final rather complex picture . as noted above",
    ", we save detailed discussion of experiments for other papers ; but in section [ sec:6 ] we will indicate the general nature of our predictions .",
    "we briefly describe the giant spin model here , and the various energy scales relevant to the physics .",
    "the basic idea behind this model has been explained in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the exchange couplings @xmath16 between electronic spins in the grain are enormous compared to the anisotropy couplings @xmath17 ( typically @xmath18 , whereas @xmath19 ) .",
    "the mesoscopic grains can be treated as giant rotators , keeping only states @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum of this giant spin is shown in fig.1 in a small bias field @xmath22 . sometimes , as a model example",
    ", we shall use the easy - axis / easy - plane system , having hamiltonian @xmath23 -\\gamma \\vec{s } \\cdot \\vec{h}_o \\;. \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] we will usually assume @xmath24 , so @xmath25 .    the low energy physics of ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be understood in terms of the truncated hamiltonian @xmath26 where the tunneling splitting @xmath27 is @xmath28 and the bare parameters are @xmath29 @xmath30 the `` bounce frequency '' @xmath31 is also roughly the distance to the next pair of excited levels ; the total barrier height in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , between the 2 semiclassical minima at @xmath32 , is @xmath33 . thus if , say , @xmath34 , we might easily have @xmath35 , a barrier height @xmath36 , but a splitting @xmath37 , or less .",
    "this is certainly not the whole story .",
    "magnetic grains having more complicated symmetries are not so easily described using wkb / instanton methods .",
    "the `` internal '' magnon modes of the giant spin are also neglected , except for those uniform precession modes corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "there will also be phonons ( spectrally very weak at these low energies ) and possibly electrons ( which will mix strongly with all states of the grain ) .",
    "finally and most importantly , the nuclei in the grain ( and also possibly outside ) will couple via hyperfine interactions to each level shown in fig.2 .",
    "the net result of this is shown in fig.3 for the 2 lowest levels in the presence of a bias field .",
    "typically @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an _",
    "individual _ hyperfine coupling ; however @xmath40 nuclei will spread out a single grain level into a mass of @xmath41 levels , of gaussian half - width @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the principal hyperfine splitting . for rare earths ,",
    "where @xmath44 or greater , this half - width can easily exceed @xmath31 for mesoscopic grains , and the whole `` giant spin '' model begins to get rather complex .    in this paper",
    "we will ignore all physics at energies @xmath45 or greater , simply including it into renormalisation parameters of a low-@xmath10 effective hamiltonian .",
    "for such a treatment to be valid , we then require @xmath46    we will also assume that any `` loose spins '' on the surface of the grain still have couplings @xmath47 to @xmath2 . if not , they will be treated as part of the `` spin bath '' environment , along with nuclei and paramagnetic impurity spins .    before beginning , it is useful to bear in mind 2 simple points",
    ". note first that in the presence of any bias @xmath22 which is greater than @xmath48 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) , the system is essentially `` frozen '' in one or other of the states @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "suppose , e.g. , the system starts in the higher - energy state @xmath49 at @xmath51 .",
    "then the probability @xmath52 of finding it @xmath49 at time @xmath53 , in the absence of any other couplings , is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "thus the coupling to phonons , electrons , and nuclei is necessary if we are to have any relaxation at all .",
    "usually one thinks of this as a kind of spontaneous or stimulated emission , perhaps in the presence of dissipation , in which the requisite energy is taken up by a bath of oscillators .",
    "in fact this conventional picture of tunneling of a biased 2-level system , coupled dissipatively to a bath of oscillators @xcite , works reasonably well for a giant spin coupled to either electrons or phonons .",
    "this we shall see in detail in the next two sections .",
    "however as soon as we introduce the spin bath of nuclei , etc . , it breakes down completely ; this is basically why our final results are so surprising .",
    "the second point arises from the finite - dimensional nature of the giant spin hilbert space .",
    "as emphasized by van hemmen and suto @xcite this means that we must use wkb calculations of tunneling rates with great care when discussing the motion of @xmath2 .",
    "this point is especially clear in recent work of politi et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also villain et al .",
    "@xcite ) , analysing the mn@xmath56o@xmath56 acetate systems ; here tunneling appears to proceed via a 4th - order term @xmath57 in @xmath58 .",
    "consequently transitions may only proceed between states differing by @xmath59 .",
    "to correctly handle such selection rules in the instanton calculus is not a trivial problem .",
    "even more important , there is no continuum of final states in this tunneling problem , and tunneling may only proceed if there is near resonance between initial and final states .",
    "this means that in the presence of a bath of , e.g. , phonons , one may _ not _ in general simply apply the caldeira - leggett tunneling formalism @xcite to calculate tunneling , since this formalism assumes a continuum of final states . for this reason calculations such as those of garg and kim @xcite , of the tunneling rate of a strongly biased grain interacting with phonons ,",
    "can only be correct when @xmath60 . for finite @xmath61",
    "one must take account of the discrete nature of the spectrum of @xmath61 , at least when the level spacing is greater than the ( very small ) linewidth caused by phonon damping ( note further that calculations of grain tunneling in the presence of a nuclear spin bath should _ never _ use the caldeira - leggett method , since the spin bath can not be mapped onto an oscillator bath of the feynman - vernon @xcite type - thus calculations of this kind @xcite are not valid for any @xmath61 ) .",
    "we now turn to the detailed treatment of the different relaxation mechanisms .",
    "readers wishing to see only a summary of the results should proceed directly to section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in this section we develop a model for the coupling between the giant spin and the electron bath only , and use it to calculate relaxation rates for the grain magnetisation .",
    "since , as far as we are aware , no attempt has ever been made to deal with the coupled giant spin / electron system before , it is clear that we must begin from first principles .",
    "the full development of our model , including detailed discussion of the multiple - scattering of the electrons by the individual spins inside the grain , the effects due to surface spins , to the discreteness of the electronic spectrum inside the grain if it is on an insulating substrate , the interaction between electrons and the internal degrees of freedom ( magnons ) in the grain , etc .",
    ", will not appear in this paper .",
    "we shall also set aside questions about how conduction electron dynamics _ outside _ the grain , in a conducting substrate , will be influenced by the giant spin dynamics .",
    "this is a very important question for any experiment ( which can use the substrate magnetoresistance as a probe of the grain dynamics ) , but is too complicated to deal with here .",
    "there are 3 physical situations which we will address here .",
    "the first involves conducting electrons both inside and outside the grain ; we shall see that this problem can be analysed fairly clearly .",
    "likewise the problem of an insulating grain interacting with conducting substrate can be modelled in a reasonably treatable way .",
    "the problem of a conducting grain and an insulating substrate is more messy , however we can fairly easily extract the essential results .",
    "our essential result is that unless the substrate is insulating , electrons simply freeze @xmath2 , unless @xmath61 is very small .",
    "we emphasize that in reality , nuclear spins must be included ( sections [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "we shall start by assuming that the giant spin , contained within a volume @xmath62 , interacts with an electron fluid which permeates freely through the boundary between grain and substrate ; i.e. , a hamiltonian @xmath63 describing short - range exchange interaction between the localised individual spins @xmath64 , located at positions @xmath65 inside the grain , and conduction electrons in momentum @xmath66 .",
    "a more refined model would couple grain electrons in eigenstates @xmath67 to substrate electrons @xmath66 , via a transfer matrix @xmath68 across the boundary .",
    "however it is intuitively obvious that this is unnecessary once @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the typical level spacing between internal electron states of the grain . if the electronic bandwidth is @xmath71 , then @xmath72 , and for most metals @xmath73 ; thus if @xmath74 , @xmath75 , so that an insulating layer at least @xmath76 thick would be required to make such a model necessary .",
    "we assume in using ( [ 2.1 ] ) that the internal grain spins are locked together to form a giant spin , and that the @xmath77 already take account of the virtual mixing between internal excited states of the magnetic ions and of the giant spin ( magnons , surface modes ) and the electron bath .",
    "thus , as usual , we shall be working at low @xmath10 and small @xmath78 .",
    "however we shall assume that the @xmath77 can vary ; near the surface of the grain boundary they may be a little weaker .",
    "the present model does not include `` loose spins '' , i.e. , surface spins which are more weakly coupled to the motion of @xmath2 ( the reader should not confuse the kondo coupling @xmath77 here with the inter - spin exchange @xmath16 between spins inside the grain ) .",
    "these will be discussed in section [ sec:4 ] onwards .",
    "typically the kondo couplings @xmath79 .",
    "we now rewrite ( [ 2.1 ] ) , incorporating the giant spin hypothesis , to get a volume averaged interaction @xmath80 @xmath81 where the form factor @xmath82 integrates the number density @xmath83 of microscopic spins over the grain volume , and @xmath84 is the mean value of the @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath85 is a sort of `` giant spin kondo hamiltonian '' , and as such contains a lot of interesting physics , much of which we will ignore in this paper .",
    "recall that the kondo coupling for microscopic spins is just ( [ 2.2 ] ) with @xmath83 in ( [ 2.3 ] ) restricted to a single lattice cell ; for this problem one conventionally defines a dimensionless coupling @xmath86 for most metals , where @xmath87 is the fermi surface density of states .",
    "the kondo problem can be mapped onto an ohmic spin - boson problem of the kind discussed by leggett _ et al_. @xcite ; even for this spin-@xmath88 system , there is a large dimensionless ohmic coupling to the electron bath ; @xmath89 .",
    "it is possible to start with ( [ 2.1 ] ) and build up an analogous description by considering the individual kondo scattering from each spin , in many different orbital channels .",
    "here we shall finesse entirely this move by instead integrating out the electrons directly , starting from ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "we first truncate directly to a biased spin - boson hamiltonian of form ( for @xmath90 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) ) : @xmath91 where the bias field is parallel to the easy axis ( we shall ignore transverse fields here ) . the caldeira - leggett spectral function for this problem",
    "is @xmath92 and the ohmic coupling constant @xmath93 is determined by a standard fermi surface average @xcite over electrons , i.e. , @xmath94 the naive guess that @xmath95 , apparently confirmed by ( [ 2.6 ] ) , is however wrong ; carrying out the average , one gets @xmath96    this at first surprising result is a consequence of interference between kondo scattering at different sites - notice that @xmath97 , so that the problem is a multiple scattering one .",
    "a related point is that the estimate of @xmath93 in ( [ 2.7 ] ) looks perturbative - it is not clear it should work for large @xmath93 .",
    "however for a grain of radius @xmath98 some @xmath99 orbital channels are playing role in electron scattering . if @xmath100 , the phase shifts in each channel are small ( one has @xmath101 ) , making it possible to apply a perturbation theory , yet the sum over all the channels can be rather large .",
    "the case of large phase shifts is more complicated , and may result in a giant spin dynamics different from that described by the standard ohmic model .",
    "we address this possibility in appendix a.    for mesoscopic spins ( @xmath102 ) the coupling in ( [ 2.7 ] ) is very large ; we may take over standard results from the spin - boson problem to discuss its effect on the dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath103 , coherence at zero bias is destroyed at any temperature ; at @xmath12 the grain dynamics are rigidly locked , and the spin @xmath2 can not move . at finite @xmath10 and @xmath104 , the system fluctuates incoherently between the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 at a rate @xmath107 ; on the other hand if @xmath108 , one has incoherent relaxation at a rate @xmath109 .",
    "the general result for the relaxation rate is @xcite @xmath110 \\mid^2 \\over \\gamma [ 2\\alpha_b ] } \\ ; , \\label{2.8}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 $ ] is the gamma function ; for @xmath112 , this gives @xmath113 \\over \\gamma [ 2\\alpha_b ] } \\left ( { 2 \\pi t \\over \\omega_o } \\right)^{2\\alpha_b-1 } \\;.",
    "\\label{2.9}\\ ] ] on the other hand for very low @xmath10 , such that @xmath114 , it gives @xmath115 } \\left",
    "( { \\epsilon   \\over \\omega_o } \\right)^{2\\alpha_b-1 } \\;. \\label{2.10}\\ ] ]    the crucial thing to notice here is that for microscopic spins ( @xmath116 ) , there will be easily observable relaxation of @xmath2 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath61 is much greater than @xmath117 , the giant spin will be frozen completely , even over astronomical times , unless either bias or temperature is large ( @xmath118 ) . moreover , in this model we would expect that applying either a large bias or temperature would lead to a sudden `` switching on '' of the relaxation at some critical bias or temperature ( however recall that our model is not strictly valid for @xmath118 , since higher levels of @xmath2 will then enter into the picture ) .    to see this , consider 2 examples .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , so @xmath121 .",
    "then ( [ 2.9 ] ) shows that for bias @xmath104 , we have @xmath122 , and if @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 . since @xmath125 might be something like @xmath126 , this implies low @xmath10 or low @xmath8 relaxation times of fractions of a second .    on the other hand , consider a second example where @xmath119 but @xmath127 , so @xmath128 .",
    "then if @xmath104 , we find that @xmath129 , and if @xmath12 , we find @xmath130.then if @xmath104 we see that the relaxation suddenly switches on at a temperature @xmath131 ( if we are interested in a relaxation time of order seconds ) ; for temperatures below this , relaxation times increase catastrophically ( if @xmath132 , we find @xmath133 years ! ) .",
    "the same happens as a function of bias when @xmath134 .",
    "obviously if we go to even larger grains , with @xmath135 , this switching process becomes almost a step function of temperature .",
    "although our 2-level model starts to break down once @xmath136 , this will not affect the validity of this switching result , or our calculation of the switching temperature .",
    "we have not included nuclear spins in these calculations - in section [ sec:5 ] we shall see how a combination of nuclear spins and electrons affects the dynamics of @xmath2 .",
    "the insulating grain can be analysed in a similar way , provided we gloss over some of the complications arising from the variation of both the electron density and the spin properties in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "thus we naively extend the previous model by writing an effective interaction hamiltonian @xmath137 @xmath138 where now the form factor takes account of the decay of the electron density @xmath139 as one penetrates into the sample . by the same manoeuvres as before this leads to an ohmic coupling @xmath140 where @xmath141 , but is multiplied by some `` scale factor '' which describes the depth to which the electrons penetrate into the grain ; clearly it can vary widely .",
    "the reduction to only near surface spins makes @xmath142 for large @xmath61 , but from ( [ 2.13 ] ) we see that @xmath143 if @xmath144 . for smaller grains ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath145 , one can have @xmath146 , and then results different from the `` frozen spin '' behaviour of ( [ 2.8])-([2.10 ] ) are obtained .",
    "we may define a renormalised splitting @xmath48 , and a damping rate @xmath147 , by @xmath148 @xmath149    at @xmath12 one can get @xcite coherent motion if @xmath150 ; however any such coherence is destroyed once @xmath151 , which even for microscopic values of @xmath61 ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) will occur at extremely low temperatures , usually much less then @xmath153 . for higher @xmath10 we find , when @xmath104 and @xmath146 , that @xmath154 is still given by ( [ 2.9 ] ) , which in terms of @xmath48 is @xmath155 \\over \\gamma [ 2\\alpha_s ] } \\left ( { 2 \\pi t \\over \\delta_s }",
    "\\right)^{2\\alpha_s-1 } \\;. \\label{2.16}\\ ] ] for finite @xmath3 and @xmath10 , the form ( [ 2.8 ] ) is still valid , as is ( [ 2.10 ] ) when @xmath108 .    from all of these results",
    "we conclude that for low @xmath10 and @xmath3 , the relaxation dynamics of mesoscopic grains will be extremely slow in the presence of a conducting substrate .",
    "thus , although our models have certainly not included all possible nuances of the surface physics , one conclusion is very clear and unlikely to be affected by further refinements , i.e. , that for @xmath156 , mesoscopic magnetic grains on conducting substrates will have their spin dynamics completely frozen . however once either @xmath10 or @xmath3 is of order @xmath31 or greater , these dynamics will rapidly be liberated .",
    "again , these statements will be modified if nuclear spin effects are important ( section [ sec:5 ] ) .      in the opposite extreme when the substrate is insulating",
    ", the character of the electron states is quite different - they form a set of discrete states @xmath157 inside the grain , with mean spacing @xmath158 for bandwidth @xmath71 .",
    "we describe these states via creation and annihilation operators @xmath159,@xmath160 ; these states will be rather complicated , even in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "it is very useful to separate the exchange scattering interaction into bulk and surface parts , where now the bulk part sums over the whole sample , assuming that all the @xmath77 are the same , whilst the surface part describes the _ difference _ between @xmath161 and the true interaction hamiltonian @xmath162 ; thus if @xmath163 with the @xmath164 creating electron on site @xmath165 , we write @xmath166 and the surface term @xmath167    we notice that the bulk term is diagonal in both the site representation and the exact eigenstate representation , because of completeness of states .",
    "this is important , because the condition @xmath168 means that the electron spins inside the system will rotate rigidly with @xmath2 , and from the last form in ( [ 2.18 ] ) we see that there is no way this adiabatic rotation can excite the low energy orbital states @xmath169 of the system .",
    "thus the effect of @xmath161 is simply to renormalise the moment of inertia of the giant spin .",
    "on the other hand the surface term does have off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath170 and this may result in infrared electron - hole pair production when @xmath2 flips .",
    "the calculation of the corresponding coupling parameter @xmath171 proceeds in exactly the same way as in the previous subsection ( the corrections to the plane - wave calculation are small in a large grain with @xmath172 ) .",
    "thus at high temperatures the internal conduction electrons constitute an ohmic bath with @xmath173 ( here @xmath174 is given by @xmath175 averaged over the surface ) .",
    "now we notice that this result holds only at @xmath176 . at lower temperature the effective coupling constant goes to zero exponentially with @xmath10 : @xmath177 and the infrared renormalisation of the tunneling rate stops at @xmath178 if @xmath179 one has @xmath180 , and we do not have to worry about conduction electrons in the grain at all because they will rotate adiabatically with @xmath2",
    ".    the onset of coherent motion in zero bias can be found by comparing the damping rate @xmath181 with @xmath48 .",
    "expressing all the parameters in terms of @xmath61 we find the criterion of coherence in the form @xmath182 for experiments at @xmath183 temperatures and small bias @xmath184 , this means that electronic dissipation effects can be ignored in such grains provided @xmath185 .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath10 and/or @xmath186 , we return to the case of strong ohmic dissipation which looks very much the same as that for an insulating grain on a metallic substrate .",
    "in the absence of electrons ( and of nuclear spins ) relaxation in a biased system proceeds via phonons .",
    "this is a very slow process - typical relaxation times are of order months .",
    "a number of previous studies have appeared ; garg & kim @xcite and chudnovsky @xcite have discussed grain tunneling within a straightforward caldeira - leggett approach , assuming a continuum of final states available for the tunneling - we have already explained problems with this approach in the introduction .",
    "et al_. @xcite have given a very thorough discussion of the effects of phonons on tunneling in the mn@xmath56o@xmath56 acetate system , including the effects of discrete initial and final states , and the non - diagonal couplings ( to be defined below ) .",
    "they also take proper account of the symmetries and selection rules in the tunneling transitions .",
    "whether their theory explains the relaxation measurements in mn@xmath56o@xmath56 acetate @xcite is another matter - in our opinion the explanation may have more to do with dipolar interactions between the molecules @xcite .",

    "the values of the relevant couplings are then estimated - no attempt is made at exact calculations , since these would depend so much on the detailed nature of the system in question .",
    "our main result is that these couplings are so weak that phonons by themselves are incapable of causing anything but very slow relaxation of @xmath2 .",

    "however we shall see that in this system the diagonal couplings are zero unless we apply a field perpendicular to the easy axis .",
    "the reason for this is very simple - time reversal symmetry implies that the magnetoacoustic interaction can not distinguish between grain states @xmath195 and @xmath196 when @xmath197 ( a point which also arises in the interaction of phonons with domain walls @xcite ) , and diagonal couplings describe interactions which do distinguish such states . applying a transverse field projects a component of @xmath195 on @xmath196 , and enables such a coupling ; from this argument we see that @xmath198 is proportional to the transverse field @xmath199 .",
    "we shall later see that @xmath200 for a field applied in the easy plane .    before deriving ( [ 3.1 ] ) and evaluating the couplings ,",
    "we first give the results for relaxation rates that derive from it .",
    "just as for the electron bath , these rates are very low , but for the opposite reason - instead of being frozen by a very strong coupling , @xmath2 is frozen because the effective coupling is so weak !    the relaxation rates are derived by first defining caldeira - leggett spectral functions @xmath201 where @xmath202 ; these describe the phonon effect on grain dynamics via @xmath203nd order perturbation theory .",

    "this ratio is large unless the external field is almost parallel to @xmath232 .",

    "thus , if we ignore nuclear spin effects , the relaxation times at @xmath239 are already very long ; and @xmath240 is actually a large value for @xmath27 .",
    "if the bias energy is further reduced to the @xmath27 scale we get astronomically large @xmath241 .    to get ( [ 3.11 ] ) and ( [ 3.12 ] )",
    "we start by noting that chudnovsky s angular momentum coupling @xmath242 integrated over the grain volume , is nothing but that set of transverse terms in the magnetoacoustic coupling which is responsible for transporting angular momentum to the transverse phonons .",
    "this magnetoacoustic coupling has the general form @xmath243 where the coefficients @xmath244 are energy densities , and in fact are simply combinations of the magnetic anisotropy constants ( i.e. , of @xmath245 and @xmath246 in the case of @xmath247 ) , since this is the only energy scale that can be involved . from this",

    "as noted in the introduction , this spin bath can not be mapped onto an oscillator bath , and so a completely different kind of theoretical framework is necessary to describe its effects on mesoscopic or macroscopic quantum objects .",
    "the main point of this section is to show how the spin bath , interacting in isolation with a giant spin @xmath2 , will basically block any relaxation at all , unless either the grain happens to be in a total field ( produced by the sum of the external field and the `` internal bias field '' generated by the nuclei ) which is very small , less than roughly @xmath27 ; _ or _ the nuclear spin diffusion mechanism of energy bias diffusion allows the system to find the resonance window . in what follows we first briefly recall the 4 mechanisms by which the spin bath controls the giant spin dynamics , and set up the formalism required to analyse magnetic relaxation in the presence of nuclear spins .",
    "we then derive the relaxation dynamics of @xmath2 , first ignoring the internuclear spin diffusion ( to see how @xmath2 is frozen ) , then including it ( to show how @xmath2 can then relax ) .      in an earlier series of papers @xcite we have constructed a theoretical description of a giant spin interacting with a more or less arbitrary spin bath , and solved this model for the quantum dynamics of @xmath2 in the absence of any external bias .",
    "the same sort of model has also been set up to describe an arbitrary unbiased macroscopic coordinate interacting with a spin bath .",

    "the fraction of grains in an ensemble having bias @xmath327 is roughly @xmath328 if @xmath329 , and @xmath330 if @xmath331 ; the result for @xmath329 arises because only a fraction @xmath332 of that portion @xmath325 of grains having @xmath333 can flip when the different polarisation groups do not overlap .",
    "thus only a small fraction @xmath334 of spins are not `` degeneracy blocked '' from tunneling ( in the absence of nuclear dynamics , the effects of which are discussed below and in a section [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy blocking mechanism operates just as easily whether there is an external bias or not - in both cases only grains in the small window of bias can make transitions .",

    "orthogonality blocking inhibits both coherence and relaxation of @xmath2 ; it spreads out the high - frequency ( @xmath348 ) response of the grain to lower frequencies .",
    "\\(iv ) a final interaction mechanism arises simply because the giant spin can flip the nuclear spins .",
    "this process is parametrised by the @xmath291 in ( [ 4.4 ] ) ; for the whole spin bath one finds that on average a number @xmath349 of spins will be flipped each time @xmath2 flips , where @xmath350 for @xmath351 .",
    "this causes phase decoherence ; we have called this mechanism `` topological decoherence '' because it adds a random winding number to the effective action for @xmath2 .",
    "it has a decoherence effect on tunneling , and thus inhibits magnetic relaxation .",
    "the formal discussion of all these mechanisms has appeared in our previous work . in the next 2 sub - sections we will deal first with the dynamics of @xmath2 in the absence of spin diffusion between the nuclei , to show how the nuclei keep all but a tiny fraction of grains frozen ; then we show how spin diffusion changes this picture .",
    "we assume that neither the grain nor the spin bath is connected to an external thermostat except at time @xmath352 ( in reality both are coupled to phonons and possibly electrons - see next section ) .",
    "we also neglect nuclear spin diffusion here , and estimate its role later . thus relaxation of @xmath2 , in a bias , can only occur if the bias field due to the @xmath275 allows states @xmath353 , with the @xmath354 in some polarisation state @xmath355 , to overlap in energy ( within @xmath356 ) with some states @xmath357 , where the polarisation state @xmath358 in general .",

    "by contrast in the oscillator bath models , the coupling to the macroscopic system is weak ( @xmath442 , for each oscillator ) , and the dynamics of the individual oscillators is only weakly perturbed by the system .",
    "this is why , in the theory of the oscillator bath , one can first calculate the weakly perturbed oscillator motion as a function of the system coordinates , and then integrate out the oscillators by functional averaging .",
    "no such manoeuvre is possible for the spin bath ( or indeed any other environment where the couplings are not weak ) , and it is _ not possible _ to map the spin bath onto an oscillator bath ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "any attempt to do so ( by , e.g. , writing a spectral function @xmath443 , for a set of `` nuclear spin oscillators '' , as in ref.@xcite ) , can not be expected to give meaningful results .    from these remarks",
    "we can also see what has been left out of eq.([4.11 ] ) for @xmath444 ; we have left out everything coming from the independent dynamics of the spin bath ( independent , that is , from @xmath2 ) .",
    "formally this can be put in by including these dynamics in @xmath445 in ( [ 4.12 ] ) . as we argue below this",
    "corresponds to allowing a _ time - dependent bias _",
    "@xmath9 in ( [ 4.10 ] ) and ( [ 4.11 ] ) .",
    "we neglect the effect of coupling of the nuclei to phonons which is actually an incredibly small effect in most cases . in reality",
    "the nuclear spin dynamics comes almost entirely from nuclear spin diffusion , parametrised by the transverse relaxation time @xmath340 , and caused by the dipolar interaction in ( [ 4.2 ] ) . as we shall see presently , if the spin bath is mainly composed of nuclei , this spin diffusion is crucial , since without it @xmath2 can not relax at all .",
    "spin diffusion processes , in which @xmath336 remains unchanged but pairs of nuclei flip , cause @xmath9 to fluctuate in time because of the variation @xmath446 in the coupling of each nuclei to @xmath2 ( thus , for a process @xmath447 involving 2 nuclei , the total change in internal bias @xmath448 ; if @xmath40 nuclei flip , the change in @xmath8 is @xmath449 ) .",
    "now this fluctuation is _ fast _ , in the sense that for large values of @xmath382 the time it takes @xmath9 to change by an energy @xmath450 is usually much less than the time @xmath451 required for @xmath2 to flip if it is in the coherence window ( of energy width @xmath450 ) ; this will be demonstrated below .",
    "consequently it is not necessary ( or even useful ) to go through the elaborate detour of recalculating @xmath445 in eq.([4.12 ] ) , including a coupling to some effective `` oscillator bath '' , intended to model the effects of spin diffusion .",
    "we simply write instead that for this fast diffusion problem , where @xmath9 varies over an energy range @xmath452 , one has : @xmath453 \\ ; , \\label{4.23}\\ ] ] where we introduced the notation @xmath454 with @xmath455=integer and @xmath456 to define the shift in the polarisation change enforced by applying the external bias . here",

    "in the usual case where @xmath323 , or if the external bias is close to a multiple of @xmath43 , the expression for the effective relaxation rate simplifies to @xmath460    this concludes our formal discussion of the problem of quantum relaxation of @xmath2 when it is coupled to a spin bath .",
    "we now use the results to find @xmath461 for a few interesting cases .",
    "we start by ignoring spin diffusion , in order to demonstrate the way in which relaxation is blocked in its absence .",
    "let us first consider a really pathological case , in which there is no degeneracy blocking at all , i.e. , @xmath462 .",
    "then the function @xmath312 simply becomes a set of sharp lines , and _ all states in a grain ensemble may resonantly tunnel _ , if @xmath463 .",

    "the higher-@xmath382 processes take over - recall that for large @xmath382 , the transition amplitude @xmath450 is very small , since @xmath465 , which collapses when @xmath466 .",
    "to get some idea of the resulting relaxation , consider what happens if @xmath429 , and let us ignore topological decoherence for simplicity ( which makes no difference for the long-@xmath53 asymptotics of the result ) .",

    "the resulting curves are shown for @xmath471 in fig.6 , for various @xmath444 .",
    "it is easy to then find the behaviour of @xmath385 by substituting ( [ 4.29 ] ) into ( [ 4.22 ] ) .",
    "the steepest - descent integral over @xmath382 gives an accurate answer for long times .",
    "however we more quickly derive this long time behaviour from dimensional arguments .",
    "the sum over @xmath382 contains some @xmath472 polarisation groups inside the broad envelope function @xmath473 ; thus the crossover from @xmath474 to the equilibrium @xmath475 occurs around a time @xmath476 such that @xmath477 , i.e. , @xmath478    for shorter times the relaxation is roughly logarithmic , viz .",

    "however even the tiniest degeneracy blocking will upset these results - in fact if @xmath481 , the result ( [ 4.29 ] ) fails completely .",
    "since the proverbial `` thunderstorm on jupiter '' is enough to give a @xmath310 exceeding @xmath482 for the large values of @xmath382 governing long time relaxation , we see that for relaxation ( just as for coherence @xcite ) , it is the limit of strong degeneracy blocking that is experimentally meaningful .",
    "let us again consider the zero bias case in this limit , where @xmath483 .",
    "we go back to ( [ 4.21 ] ) , again assume @xmath469 for simplicity , and , noting that the oscillatory @xmath484 term in @xmath445 ( eq.([4.12 ] ) ) gives an integrated contribution @xmath485 = { \\pi \\delta_m(y ) \\over 2 } \\int_0^{2\\delta_m(y)t } dz j_0(z ) \\ ; ; \\label{4.33}\\ ] ] we find @xmath486 this result describes an ensemble of grains in which a fraction @xmath334 of grains relaxes , leaving a fraction @xmath487 completely unrelaxed in the infinite - time limit ; a is given by @xmath488 since terms for @xmath489 make almost no contribution to @xmath334 due to the collapse of @xmath450 , it can be approximated for large @xmath386 by @xmath490 where @xmath325 is the number of states in the @xmath491 polarisation group ( in ref.@xcite we showed that individual terms in the sum over @xmath382 decreased as @xmath492 ; but the sum over all @xmath382 gives the factor @xmath493 ) .",
    "thus we see that apart from the small number of grains in near resonance , most grains will be frozen for eternity by the nuclear bias field , even in the absence of an external bias ( again , ignoring nuclear spin diffusion ) . adding an external bias makes essentially no difference to this ( since this bias is physically indistinguishable from the internal bias ) .",
    "in fact the bias will have no effect at all on ( [ 4.34 ] ) until @xmath494 the energy scale of variation of @xmath312 .",
    "for @xmath495 , this means that we will see oscillations in the decay rate as a function of @xmath22 , with period @xmath43 . for @xmath323 , the decay rate and decay function @xmath334 will change very little until @xmath496 ; for @xmath497 the relaxed fraction @xmath498 since not even the nuclei can bring the system into resonance .",
    "we derive also a useful formula for the bias and temperature effects by noting that only small @xmath499 contribute to the sum in eq.([4.21 ] ) and thus @xmath500 giving @xmath501    none of the results ( [ 4.29])-([4.36f ] ) is physical at very long time , because we have ignored the time variation of @xmath8 caused by nuclear spin diffusion .",
    "let us now demonstrate that nuclear spin diffusion is _ fast _ , so that equations ( [ 4.24])-([4.26 ] ) are justified .",
    "notice first that since dipolar pairwise flips occur at a rate @xmath335 for a given pair , and assuming short - ranged pair flips , we have roughly @xmath502 nuclear flips per second in the sample .",
    "then in a time @xmath451 we have @xmath503 such flips , and in this time the bias will change by @xmath504 .",
    "the condition for fast diffusion is @xmath505 ( so the system has no time to tunnel ) , i.e. , fast diffusion requires @xcite",
    "@xmath506    if the spread @xmath507 arises from the dipolar interactions between the same kind of nuclei only , then @xmath508 ( but usually @xmath509 , because of other nuclei and fields ) , then this criterion becomes @xmath510 .",
    "now in fact @xmath335 will be typical @xmath511 ( depending on the isotopic concentration of nuclear spins , etc . ) .",
    "for any mesoscopic spin @xmath512 ( at least for most bare hamiltonians ) , so that even if ( [ 4.37 ] ) is violated for @xmath513 ( i.e. , the zero polarisation change process ) , it is obeyed for large values of @xmath382 . since the bulk of the relaxation involves values of @xmath514 , we see that ( [ 4.37 ] ) will always be the relevant condition . in this case eqs.([4.23])-([4.27 ] ) follow immediately .",
    "let us now therefore evaluate @xmath385 for the coupled grain / spin bath system , taking full account of the dipolar interactions between the spins , and assuming ( [ 4.37 ] ) to be satisfied ; using ( [ 4.23])-([4.25 ] ) , with @xmath515 , this means we must evaluate , for @xmath516 @xmath517 the integral is very easily evaluated ; calling it @xmath518 , we have @xmath519 where the step - function @xmath520 , with @xmath521 arises because values of @xmath382 range up to roughly @xmath472 , and are thus typically large ; thus @xmath522 \\bigg\\ } \\;.",
    "\\label{4.41}\\ ] ]    noting again that if @xmath323 , the dependence of @xmath385 on @xmath22 in ( [ 4.41 ] ) will be rather small until @xmath523 , we begin by analysing this result for @xmath429 .",
    "this zero bias case has of course been previously analyzed in our coherence papers @xcite , but there we were only interested in the very short time behaviour of @xmath385 , i.e. , that part involving frequencies @xmath348 , connected with possible coherent oscillations .",
    "coherent behaviour can only arise in the @xmath513 polarisation sector of ( [ 4.29 ] ) , which ignores spin diffusion .",
    "however in analysing the quantum relaxation properties of @xmath2 , we need to sum over all @xmath472 important terms in ( [ 4.41 ] ) ; the effect of the spin diffusion will be to unblock the long - time relaxation . in evaluating ( [ 4.38 ] ) or ( [ 4.41 ] ) , a steepest - descent integration over @xmath382 is possible , but just as with the case of no spin diffusion , dimensional analysis is sufficient ; the crossover time from unrelaxed to almost relaxed behaviour occurs at a time @xmath476 given by @xmath524 ( compare ( [ 4.30 ] ) ) , and the short - time relaxation is roughly logarithmic , as in ( [ 4.31 ] ) , viz .",

    "thus , amusingly , the results with spin diffusion included look just like those _ without _ spin diffusion , provided @xmath439 in the latter .",
    "the physical reason for this is simple - rapid spin diffusion basically eliminates the effects of degeneracy blocking , by allowing the bias @xmath9 to cover the whole energy range of each polarisation group .",
    "this is then the fundamental reason why spin diffusion `` unlocks '' @xmath2 and allows it to relax .",
    "in fig.7 we showed a plot of @xmath385 against @xmath528 , which clearly brings out the 3 relaxation regimes .",
    "for very short times @xmath529 , there is a sudden relaxation involving only @xmath530 processes - the theory of this was given entirely in our coherence papers .",
    "for times @xmath53 such that @xmath531 , we have roughly logarithmic relaxation .",
    "then for @xmath532 , we have the behaviour in ( [ 4.32 ] ) or ( [ 4.44 ] ) .    at this point",
    "it is important to realise that for all but microscopic spins , @xmath476 will be astronomically long . from ( [ 4.42 ] ) we have @xmath533    consider now , as in fig.7 , the case of a mesoscopic spin where , e.g. , @xmath534 , @xmath535 , @xmath536 , and @xmath537 .",
    "we then find that @xmath538 , i.e. , more than @xmath539 times the age of the universe !",
    "thus for mesoscopic grains we _ always _ get logarithmic relaxation at long times , from nuclear spins , in the quantum regime .",
    "readers familiar with the experimental measurements of magnetic relaxation in grains may well be quite surprised at this result , since it is almost a central dogma of magnetism that logarithmic relaxation must arise from a distribution of energy barriers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we see that not only is this not so , but that the logarithmic relaxation has been derived here in a very general way , with essentially no approximations ( but see below ) .",
    "on the other hand for microscopic spins ( @xmath152 ) , one finds that @xmath476 can be short .",
    "for example , consider a situation where @xmath540 , @xmath541 , @xmath542 , @xmath543 , @xmath544 , and @xmath545 ( this would roughly describe a particle containing @xmath546 tb atoms ) . then one finds @xmath547 , and any direct relaxation experiment ( typically conducted over time periods @xmath548 ) would be mostly in the long - time relaxation regime .",
    "these results are both surprising and interesting , in view of the very long time ( often logarithmic ) relaxation observed in experiments .",
    "however we immediately point out that the results ( [ 4.43])-([4.45 ] ) are by no means complete - although they are correct to within @xmath527 corrections for a coupled grain / spin bath system , a realistic calculation must incorporate _ all three _ of the relaxation mechanisms we have discussed , in sections [ sec:2 ] , [ sec:3 ] , and this one . since this changes the results yet again , we will not waste time here analysing the case of large bias ( @xmath549 in ( [ 4.23])-([4.26 ] ) ) for the grain / spin bath system , but proceed directly to the general case .",
    "we now come to the crux of the paper , which involves putting together the various mechanisms discussed in sections [ sec:2]-[sec:4 ] to give a physically realistic picture of quantum relaxation in magnetic particles .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we do not attempt a comprehensive discussion of all possible cases .",
    "such a discussion would involve consideration of a large class of `` giant spin '' bare hamiltonians , with widely varying behaviour , and with each being considered throughout the whole range of field strength , field orientation , and temperature .",
    "this would only be the beginning - we would then have to go on to examine the large variety of couplings to nuclear spins ( with hyperfine couplings ranging over 3 orders of magnitude , plus quadrupolar couplings ) , the variety of different magnetoacoustic couplings , etc .",
    "we adopt the tactic here of showing how the mechanisms combine , and giving some details for one model .",
    "in other papers , in preparation , we analyse some specific experimental systems in much greater detail .",
    "we emphasize once again here that , in our view , magnetic relaxation in most experiments involves the dipolar interactions _ between _ grains in an essential way .",
    "we begin by showing how phonons and nuclear spins combine to give a rather surprising form for the relaxation at low @xmath10 .",
    "this analysis is appropriate to the case where both grain and substrate arre insulating .",
    "we then go on to include electrons - in this case phonons become irrelevant , and only the combination of electrons and nuclei are important .    before discussing the details ,",
    "let us first state the method we shall use .",
    "we have already seen how the dynamics of @xmath2 is given in the presence of a spin bath ( eqs.([4.23 ] ) or ( [ 4.38 ] ) ) .",
    "when we couple in a bath of oscillators which allow transitions between states @xmath550 and @xmath551 of the combined grain / spin bath system , in which there is no restriction on the difference @xmath366 between the polarisations of the spin bath states @xmath552 or @xmath553 , or on their biases @xmath388 and @xmath554 ( apart from those imposed by energy conservation ) , the form of @xmath385 must change . in this paper",
    "we will not attempt to give a general expression covering all mechanisms simultaneously ; this is more than we need .",
    "instead we will use 2 expressions , which apply in the 2 limiting cases of interest .",
    "these are    \\(a ) for short times , when the spin - mediate relaxation dominates ; then we ignore the oscillator bath , and use eq.([4.10 ] ) .",
    "\\(b ) for longer times the oscillator bath - mediated relaxation will take over . in this regime , each time @xmath2 flips , some of the bias energy is taken up by an oscillator mode , and the rest by some number @xmath399 of flipped spins in the spin bath .",
    "there is no restriction on either @xmath399 or the polarisation change @xmath366 , for this process to work .",
    "the complete calculation of @xmath385 here is very complicated , but we notice that as soon as we reach times where the typical oscillator - mediated transition rate , at a typical bias , is faster than the spin bath - mediated transition rate ( for those grains in an ensemble which have not yet relaxed ) , then a reasonable approximation for @xmath385 will be @xmath555   e^{-t/\\tau(\\epsilon , t ) } \\bigg\\ }   \\ ; , \\label{5.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath556 is the oscillator - mediated relaxation rate , and @xmath557 is the equilibrium population of the state @xmath195 in a given bias ( in our previous discussion of the nuclear spin effects we assumed that this bias was actually much less than @xmath10 ) .",
    "we note that this expression is _ incoherent _ , because it applies to the majority of grains in a large bias , which can not relax via the spin bath as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the relaxation rate in this incoherent case can be calculated as a second order perturbation theory expression in the tunneling amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "thus the only effect of the spin bath which is left is the distribution over the bias .",
    "the formal proof of the above statement is easy to follow for the case of pure othogonality blocking . in a typical bias @xmath558 the second order perturbation theory expression for the tunneling rate",
    "is given by @xmath559 where the sums are over the initial and final states of the spin bath @xmath560 and oscillator bath @xmath561 with the equilibrium density matrices @xmath562 .",
    "here @xmath563 describes the interaction with the phonons ( we do not even need its explicit form to prove the point ) , and the orthogonality rotation operator @xmath564 is given by @xmath565 the crucial point here is that in a large bias one may drop the energy @xmath566 transferred to the spin bath from the @xmath567-function argument in ( [ 5.1a ] ) , because only transitions for which @xmath568 contribute to the answer .",
    "after that we have the sum over the complete set of states @xmath569 , so that @xmath570 because the of the unitarity of @xmath564 , and the final answer is that for the oscillator bath alone . including topological decoherence changes the result in a minor way",
    "indeed , with nonzero @xmath291 , we have @xmath571 and the result for the relaxation rate in the oscillator bath is renormalized by the factor @xmath572 unless @xmath573 and the topological phase @xmath574 is a multiple of @xmath575 , this factor is of order @xmath576 , and clearly has no essential effect on the results .",
    "thus , apart from the renormalisation factor @xmath71 , the relaxation of a single grain in a nuclear bias field @xmath3 is that already given in sections [ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] , and all that remains for a grain ensemble is to average over the bias field .",
    "the case of insulating grains and an insulating substrate is the one where there is most obvious competition and interplay , between the nuclear spin and phonon relaxation mechanisms .",
    "they are both slow .",
    "we have already seen ( fig.6 , and eq.([4.43 ] ) ) what the short - time relaxation will look like .",
    "now consider the implications of ( [ 5.1 ] ) for the long - time relaxation .",
    "we worked out @xmath215 for phonon relaxation in the absence of nuclear spins ; for a longitudinal bias this was given by ( [ 3.13 ] ) , and will be roughly the same in the presence of the spin bath ( i.e. , with the renormalisation factor ( [ 5.1d ] ) above ) .",
    "thus we write @xmath577 in the form @xmath578 where @xmath579 is a `` typical '' normalising relaxation rate , defined as @xmath580 and @xmath581 is the width of the gaussian peak in @xmath312 , i.e. , @xmath582 notice that for a fixed bias @xmath583 , the actual relaxation rate @xmath584 still depends on temperature as @xmath585 . at low @xmath10",
    "this scales down to the constant value @xmath579 , whereas at high @xmath10 it increases linearly , i.e. , @xmath586 .",
    "it is useful to get some preliminary idea of typical time scales for @xmath587 .",
    "let us consider 3 examples , viz . , ( i ) a tb oxide grain , with @xmath588 , containing @xmath589 nuclei ; ( ii ) a particle of er@xmath590as ( such particles are apparently insulating @xcite , containing @xmath589 nuclei , with @xmath591 ; and ( iii ) ni@xmath590o grains with @xmath591 , but @xmath592 only ( coming from the @xmath593 of ni@xmath594 nuclear spins ) .",

    "the typical relaxation occurs at a rate @xmath619 , i.e. , it is faster for higher temperatures , in accordance with the remarks just after eq.([5.8 ] ) .",
    "we may think of the power law as a `` grain - ensemble '' sum of a lot of different exponential decays , or as a funny kind of `` stretched exponential '' .",
    "note however that the decay is _ not _ logarithmic in time .",

    "for @xmath637 the previous answer ( [ 5.19 ] ) hardly changes except that the amplitude of the relaxing component is given now by @xmath638 we observe that already for rather small bias @xmath639 we have an exponential dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "the negative bias will simply further suppress an already exponentially small fraction of relaxing grains and we shall not go into more details here .",
    "the case of positive @xmath22 is much more intriguing and surprising .",
    "after an exponential increase in the amplitude up to @xmath640 for @xmath641 , the answer changes drastically . for @xmath642",
    "one finds the magnetisation function to be @xmath643 which has different behaviour depending on whether we look at short times , where @xmath644 or long times , where @xmath645 note that eqs.([5.21])-([5.24 ] ) are derived in the approximation that @xmath646 . as before ,",
    "the bias is restricted to be much less than @xmath31 .",
    "finally , at @xmath647 , this behaviour changes yet again to @xmath648 .",
    "we note the anomalous temperature and bias dependence of the effective relaxation rate ( [ 5.23 ] ) near the crossover .    from this analysis",
    "we conclude that unless the external bias is larger than @xmath581 ( or @xmath649 at low temperature ) the ensemble averaged results for the magnetisation relaxation are not described by the naive theory of a two level system coupled to a bath of oscillators , and spin bath interactions essentially modify the answer .",
    "it is worth noting three effects which have to be kept in mind when considering the evolution of the experimental data in external bias :    \\(i ) since the dependence on @xmath22 starts when @xmath650 or @xmath651 , one _ can not _ derive the value of the tunneling amplitude from this dependence , as it would be in the case of isolated two - level system ;    \\(ii ) at low temperature the giant spin is `` trapped '' in its initial state by the large and negative bias produced by the spin bath .",
    "\\(iii ) only large and positive bias can liberate the giant spin and to allow complete magnetisation relaxation .",
    "the temperature and bias dependence of the relaxation rate is anomalous near the crossover region @xmath652 . of course , when @xmath653 we recover back the pure case of oscillator bath relaxation .    at this point",
    "we would like to comment on our starting assumption that the initial state of the spin bath is equilibrated with the giant spin direction @xmath654 . experimentally this could be arranged by applying a very strong negative bias @xmath22 during a time period much longer than the longitudinal nmr relaxation time @xmath655 , and switching it off at @xmath51 . in some systems",
    "however this procedure may not work because of an astronomically long @xmath655 ( in fact , low temperature longitudinal nmr is still something of an unsolved mystery ; spin - lattice relaxation times at @xmath183 temperatures ought to be many years in insulating crystals , unless some gapless magnetic excitations are involved , e.g. , on the sample surface or crystal defects ) .",
    "it may be useful then to introduce two _ different _ temperatures - one for the oscillator bath @xmath656 and the other for the spin bath @xmath657 ( which may even be negative , i.e. , @xmath658 ! ) .",
    "our basic equation ( [ 5.1 ] ) is still valid in this more general case , but now the distribution over the initial bias is defined by the spin bath temperature , whereas the giant spin evolution toward equilibrium is governed by the crystal temperature , i.e. , @xmath659 e^{-t/\\tau(\\epsilon , t_{ph } ) } \\bigg\\ }   \\;. \\label{5.25}\\ ] ] one may proceed with the analysis of this expression as before . at this point we feel that considering more cases in this paper will not add much to the physical picture . depending on the particular experimental system and sample preparation ,",
    "the necessary formulae can be easily derived from ( [ 5.25 ] ) .",
    "summarising what we have found for insulating systems , we see that at short times , the relaxation proceeds entirely via the nuclear spin bath , and is logarithmic in time ( eq.([4.43 ] ) ) . at longer times phonons",
    "take over , and we get power law decay in time ; at low @xmath10 this goes as @xmath660 , with @xmath661 ( eqs.([5.16 ] ) and ( [ 5.19 ] ) ) , but only a small fraction of grains relax unless the bias @xmath662 or larger .",
    "this bias is necessary to counteract the nuclear bias field . at higher temperatures we still get power - law relaxation ( eq.([5.13 ] ) ) .",
    "the crossover between nuclear spin - mediated and phonon - mediated relaxation can be understood by matching eq.([4.43 ] ) with the relevant phonon expression .",
    "we now turn to the case where either the grain or the substrate is _",
    "conducting_. we use the giant kondo model of section [ sec:2 ] to describe interaction of @xmath2 with electrons , with a dimensionless coupling @xmath663 .",
    "if both grain and substrate are conducting , then @xmath664 ( eq.([2.7 ] ) ) ; if only the substrate conducts , then @xmath665 ( eq.([2.13 ] ) ) ; and if only the grain conducts , @xmath666 ( eq.([2.21 ] ) ) .",
    "the formal analysis is almost identical to that just used for phonons - we start again from ( [ 5.1 ] ) , now using the general result ( [ 2.8 ] ) for the electronic relaxation rate .",
    "the high temperature limit is most transparent because @xmath667 in eq.([2.9 ] ) is independent of the bias .",
    "thus we find a pure exponential relaxation @xmath668 at high temperature .",
    "for very small grains or conducting grains on an insulating substrate at @xmath669 , we have a peculiar relaxation regime when the internal bias is much less than temperature , but the electronic damping rate @xmath670 is already small , that is for @xmath671 there is the temperature range where @xmath672 . now",
    "the electronic relaxation rate is inversely proportional to the bias energy @xmath673 substituting this expression to ( [ 5.1 ] ) we find the time correlation function as @xmath674 which after easy evaluation yields @xmath675 the temperature dependence of the effective relaxation rate is @xmath676 , and again in the small external bias we have an unusual decay law - it is neither simple exponential nor power - law .",

    "the interpretation of these results also depends on the value of @xmath663 . if both grain and substrate are conducting , then the relaxation time in ( [ 5.32 ] ) will be greater than the age of the universe unless @xmath145 ( depending on the value of @xmath689 ) .",
    "this shows the astonishing power of the electron bath to `` freeze '' the dynamics of @xmath2 , unless it is quite microscopic in size .",
    "we shall not analyze here the case of very small @xmath61 , since once @xmath690 , the detailed structure of @xmath691 will no longer be gaussian - there will be lots of fine structure , depending on the particular systen involved .",

    "if only the substrate is conducting , then @xmath692 will be small until @xmath74 . for larger @xmath61",

    "eq.([2.23 ] ) ) . in this case , unlike the cases where the substrate is conducting , the short - time relaxation will be again dominated by nuclear spin - mediated transitions , and the weak electron - mediated transitions only enter at later times in possible competition with the phonon - mediated transitions ; the typical electron - mediated rate becomes @xmath699    note that for low enough temperature , @xmath700 in ( [ 5.39 ] ) becomes so long that electrons in the grain become irrelevant , and we return to the calculations for the nuclear spin / phonon - mediated problem , i.e. , the grain behaves as an insulator .    thus to summarize , we see that depending on whether the grain and/or substrate are conducting , we get behaviour ranging from grains frozen for all eternity ( if @xmath701 ) , to grains behaving essentially as insulators , with short - time relaxation controlled by the nuclei ( when @xmath702 ) . in the former case",
    "we see an extraordinary alliance between the electrons ( with their strong dissipative suppression of tunneling ) and nuclear spins ( which trap @xmath2 in a negative bias @xmath703 ) to block any motion of @xmath2 even at low @xmath10 , where traditionally one expects tunneling . in fact , as @xmath704 , our calculations show that @xmath2 is blocked for eternity when @xmath61 takes microscopic values ( e.g. , @xmath705 ) , because the negative bias becomes very large .",
    "this is a quite astonishing demonstration of the control that nuclear spins exert over the dynamics of @xmath2 - the spin is only unblocked when @xmath706 , when @xmath671 again ( and the whole wkb framework breaks down ! ) .",
    "let us first summarize our main results . at temperatures @xmath10 such that @xmath707 , we may employ a 2-level model with bias to describe the grain . coupling to electrons and/or phonons in this model",
    "can be treated by the usual oscillator bath methods .",
    "however the crucial coupling turns out to be to the nuclear spin bath , to which oscillator bath models do not apply .",
    "the main effect of this coupling is to spread each of the 2 levels for @xmath2 into a gaussian `` band '' of half - width @xmath708 , and total width @xmath709 , where @xmath43 is the hyperfine coupling and @xmath40 the number of nuclei in the grain .",
    "if @xmath40 and @xmath43 are small , @xmath581 may only be a few @xmath183 ( as in ni or fe grains ) .",
    "if @xmath40 and @xmath43 are large ( as in mesoscopic rare earth grains ) , @xmath581 may be hundreds of kelvin or more ( so that @xmath710 ) . at low temperatures",
    "the nuclei begin to line up with the grain vector @xmath2 , and then @xmath2 finds itself in a _ negative _ internal nuclear bias field , with a mean bias @xmath3 of roughly @xmath711",
    ". then at short times the only way that the grain can relax is by taking energy from the nuclear system .",
    "the inter - nuclear dipolar interactions allow this to happen , by causing the bias @xmath3 to become time - dependent - the result is a slow relaxation , which for an ensemble of grains gives a fraction of relaxed grains going roughly logarithmically in time ( section [ sec:4 ] ) : @xmath712 }    \\;. \\label{6.1}\\ ] ] this logarithmic relaxation , shown in fig.7 , has nothing to do with a distribution of sizes of the grains ( we assume all grains have the _ same _ parameters ) .    at longer times",
    "the grains can relax very slowly via either electron- or phonon - mediated transitions , again in the time - varying nuclear field . if the grain is insulating ( no electrons ) , we get power - law relaxation ; a fraction @xmath334 of grains can relax , where @xmath713 in a bias field @xmath22 , and these grains relax as @xmath714 where @xmath715 if @xmath716 , and @xmath717 with @xmath718 once @xmath719 .",
    "thus very few grains can relax at until the external bias @xmath22 compensates the internal bias @xmath3 and `` untraps '' @xmath2 .    if there are electrons around , the results depend on whether the substrate is conducting or not .",
    "if it is , then all but microscopic spins ( @xmath116 ) will be trapped in states of frozen magnetisation for astronomical times , once the temperature goes below @xmath31 .",
    "this remarkable result is a combination of `` degeneracy blocking '' caused by the nuclear bias field , and the very strong electronic dissipation .",
    "however if only the grain is conducting , and the substrate is insulating , then for @xmath720 , the electronic relaxation becomes negligible , and we go back to the fully insulating case ; the full results for all values of electronic coupling appear in section [ sec:5].@xmath590b .",
    "it is clear that these results have implications both for future magnetic device design , and for the thousands of experiments that have been done on magnetic grain relaxation over the years . as far as devices are concerned ,",
    "perhaps the most interesting result is the freezing of @xmath2 when both grain and substrate are conducting unless @xmath116 .",
    "this may have far - reaching implications for future computers and information storage , since it implies that if we are prepared to go to low temperatures , one should be able to use even magnetic molecules as permanent memory storage elements , perhaps of the `` m.r.a.m . ''",
    "type ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "even more tempting is the possibility that we may be able to manipulate @xmath2 in such molecules indirectly , by controlling the nuclear spin polarisation , since it is the nuclear bias field that controls the dynamics of @xmath2 .    as far as experiments on grain relaxation",
    "are concerned , we believe that it is quite urgent that experimental tests of our results be done at low @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately most of the many relaxation measurements that have already been done are at higher temperatures , where relaxation is dominated by thermal activation .",
    "what we have found here is that the low-@xmath10 behaviour does not look like the conventional tunneling picture at all - there is no crossover to a temperature - independent `` tunneling relaxation '' at temperatures @xmath707 .",
    "the low-@xmath10 behaviour of magnetic particles is not governed by the external bias at all , unless it is very large ; instead it is governed by the _ random distribution _ of internal nuclear bias fields .",
    "this renders previous theories of the tunneling of magnetic particles somewhat meaningless , regardless of the external field .",
    "thus we believe that it would be useful to look again at those experiments that _ have _ been done at low @xmath10 on ensembles of relaxing grains @xcite , particularly in an attempt to understand the `` plateau '' that often appears at low @xmath10 in the relaxation rate ( the `` magnetic viscosity plateau '' ) .",
    "however an important cautionary note is necessary . in virtually all of these experiments , _ inter - grain interactions _",
    "( mediated by the grain dipolar fields ) are very important .",
    "we believe this to be the reason for the common occurence of `` avalanche '' magnetisation reversal in grain ensembles ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) ; these avalanches are _ prima facie _ evidence for the importance of inter - grain interactions ( such avalanches also occur in multi - domain magnets , because of dipolar interactions between the domains and walls @xcite ) . thus to interpret most experiments ( including the remarkable recent results on mn@xmath56o@xmath56 molecules @xcite ) , we must incorporate these interactions - this we do elsewhere @xcite",
    ".    however some experiments may not suffer this problem .",
    "the recent results of coppinger _ et al_. @xcite , on eras grains , with @xmath74 , may be a case in point .",
    "it is not yet clear what is the effective coupling to the electron bath for this system , but we believe that the theory in the present paper should be applicable to this case .",

    "more general discussions concerning the spin bath , with s. coleman , a.j .",
    "leggett , r. penrose , and w. unruh , were also very useful .",
    "in truncating the initial hamiltonian ( [ 2.2 ] ) to the 2-level system for the giant spin one generates both the diagonal , i.e. , proportional to @xmath721 term , and nondiagonal terms @xmath722 .",
    "the latter are usually not present in the spin - boson hamiltonian because they are subdominant to the diagonal ones . in general",
    "we may write @xmath723 here @xmath724 and @xmath725 are the orbital channels for electron scattering off the grain ( @xmath726 ) , and we write the hamiltonian to be diagonal in @xmath724 for @xmath727 coupling .",
    "we observe that initially ( before scaling ) the transverse coupling @xmath728 is exponentially small as compared with @xmath729 .",
    "in fact @xmath730 because transverse matrix elements flip the giant spin as well and are therefore proportional to the overlap between the @xmath731 and @xmath732 states .",
