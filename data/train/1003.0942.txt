    "what is the mass of neutrinos ? we know that at least two of three standard model neutrino species have finite masses .",
    "the constraints on the squared mass differences of the three species of neutrinos obtained from solar @xcite and atmospheric oscillation experiments @xcite ( reviews can be found in @xcite ) are ( @xmath9 errors ) @xmath10 therefore , the lower limit on the sum of neutrino masses is @xmath11 .",
    "observations of the cmb and large - scale structure of the universe can provide limits on the _ absolute _ mass of neutrinos .",
    "the current upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses are @xmath12 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath13 ( @xmath14 cl ) from wmap7yr as a conservative upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure of the universe is a sensitive probe of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "massive neutrinos suppress the small - scale matter power spectrum by their large velocity dispersion , the fractional amount of the suppression in the small - scale limit is roughly given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 where the summation is taken over the @xmath17-th species of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "relativistic neutrinos are not a fluid .",
    "massive neutrinos , being collisionless , are not a fluid , either . however ,",
    "when the velocity dispersion of massive neutrinos becomes low enough , they may be approximately treated as a fluid , just as we normally treat cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles as a fluid on large - scales .",
    "while this is a reasonable expectation , as far as we know , the extent to which the fluid approximation is valid for massive neutrinos has not been discussed in the literature",
    ".    then , why is a fluid approximation useful while we have boltzmann codes such as cmbfast @xcite and camb @xcite , which solve the boltzmann equations numerically to the accuracy of order @xmath18 ?",
    "first , we will have more physical insight to the growth of the neutrino density fluctuations by directly solving continuity and euler equations rather than numerically solving a set of infinite order of boltzmann hierarchy .",
    "second , and most importantly , as the density fluctuations become non - linear , i.e. , @xmath19 , we need to use higher - order perturbation theories to accurately model the small - scale density fluctuations . since the higher - order perturbation theories have been constructed for cdm with a fluid approximation , we can not simply modify theories to include massive neutrinos if a fluid approximation is not valid for those particles . on the other hand ,",
    "if a fluid approximation is valid for some range of redshifts , length scales and neutrino masses , we can greatly simplify the model of non - linear density fluctuations in the presence of massive neutrino , as shown in @xcite .    in this paper , we shall study the validity of a fluid approximation of massive neutrinos . to achieve this goal",
    ", we first solve the boltzmann equations describing the evolution of the perturbed phase - space distribution function of massive neutrinos _",
    "exactly _ and compare the exact results to the results with the fluid approximation , i.e. , solutions with the higher multipole moments ( @xmath20 ) ignored .",
    "then , we shall examine the ranges of applicability of fluid approximation in both spatial and time scales , as a function of neutrino masses .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : freestreaming ] , we briefly review the effects of massive neutrino free - streaming on the structure formation of the universe . in   [ sec : boltzmann_hierarchy ] , we provide the basic fluid equations and the linearized boltzmann equation required for our theoretical flame work . in   [ sec : analytic ] , we briefly discuss the analytic solutions of the boltzmann equation for collision - less particles . in ",
    "[ sec : fluid_approx ] , we compare the exact solutions of the boltzmann equations with the fluid approximation , and discuss the limitation of the fluid approximation for several masses of massive neutrino . finally , in   [ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss the implications of our results and conclude . in appendix",
    "[ sec : sigma_app ] , we discuss how to define the free - streaming scale starting from the fluid equations . in appendix",
    "[ sec : exact_solution_app ] , we give the detailed derivation of the exact solution of the boltzmann equation both for massless and massive neutrinos .",
    "even though our main interest is in massive neutrinos , our results shown here are also applicable to collision - less particles in general , whose time evolution of the perturbed phase space distribution follows the linearized collision - less boltzmann equation with the zero - th order phase space distribution function being frozen at sufficiently early time ( i.e. , we set the initial conditions of the neutrino transfer function after the decoupling of neutrino , @xmath21 ) .",
    "we are interested in the mass range of @xmath22 for the most massive species of neutrinos , which became non - relativistic well after the matter radiation equality .",
    "the mass density of the massive neutrinos relative to the total matter density is given by @xmath23 where the summation is taken over the different species of neutrinos .",

    "when the mean energy per particle of neutrinos in the relativistic limit , @xmath24 + 1)^{-1}}{\\int d^3p~(\\exp[p / t_{\\rm\\nu}(z)]+1)^{-1 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{7\\pi^4}{180\\zeta(3)}t_{\\rm\\nu}\\simeq 3.15t_{\\rm\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] falls below @xmath25 . by solving @xmath26 ,",

    "the density fluctuation of neutrinos can not grow within the horizon size until neutrinos become non - relativistic .",

    ", we use @xmath42 .",
    "we find that the free - streaming scale is close to the horizon size until the relativistic to non - relativistic transition of a neutrino , and once the neutrino becomes non - relativistic , the free - streaming scale decreases as @xmath43 .",
    "let us examine the evolution of the neutrino density fluctuations at three length scales :    1 .   at the large - scale , where @xmath44 for all @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the present - day scale factor ) , the neutrino density fluctuation starts to grow soon after the mode enters the horizon , and its time evolution is identical to that of cdm , @xmath47 .",
    "2 .   at the small - scale , where @xmath48 for all @xmath45 , the neutrino density fluctuation oscillates around its initial value due to the free - streaming effect , @xmath49 .",
    "3 .   at the intermediate scale ,",
    "the mode first experiences the free - streaming phase , and thus does not grow . once @xmath50 is satisfied , the mode starts to grow , rapidly catching up with the gravitational potential set up by cdm .",

    "since neutrinos decoupled while they were highly relativistic , the unperturbed distribution function after the neutrino decoupling continues to be given by its relativistic form : @xmath64 even after neutrinos become non - relativistic .",
    "the temperature of such collision - less particles decreases as @xmath65 , even when they are non - relativistic .",
    "the evolution of the linearized phase - space distribution for collision - less particles such as cdm and neutrinos is governed by the linearized collision - less boltzmann equation , @xmath66=0 , \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are a newtonian gravitational potential and a curvature perturbation , respectively . and",
