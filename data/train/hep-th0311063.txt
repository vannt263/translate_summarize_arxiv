    "for this reason extra dimensions are a common feature of any theory valid at high energies .",
    "almost all problems of particle physics have been reformulated in this context giving new possibilities .",
    "in particular , physics of large extra dimensions can provide solutions to the hierarchy problem @xcite , @xcite and new mechanism of symmetry breaking @xcite , that can be tested in the next high energy experiments .",
    "in this note we developed a formalism that allows us to compute loop corrections in field theories with large extra dimensions , separating uv divergencies from finite contributions , in a direct product space .",
    "usually , higher dimensional theories are formulated using kaluza - klein decomposition .",

    "two paths with different windings are topologically different .",
    "ultraviolet divergencies in loop integrals are associated to the zero winding mode .",
    "non zero modes are long distance and each of them will give finite terms  @xcite . then this formalism is very useful to separate finite from divergent contributions .",
    "we will use winding decomposition to compute radiative corrections on 5d and 6d theories .",
    "when the theory is compactified on an orbifold translation symmetry is broken on the fixed points ; we will show how localized terms are generated at one loop .",
    "we also analyze the role of localized kinetic terms , parallel and perpendicular to the brane , interpreting them in a very intuitive way , and showing their physical effects .",
    "we show these terms can provide new mechanisms of symmetry breaking .",
    "we will compute general finite masses and also self and gauge couplings using this method .    when there are more than one extra dimensions , winding modes prove to be very useful .",
    "in particular , we consider a 6d theory and after obtaining the propagator in mixed representation , we use it to compute radiative corrections , the finite piece of the masses and the couplings .    as an interesting application we will apply this formalism to compute a two loop effective potential .",
    "we will prove that this potential can stabilize large extra dimensions when there are brane terms .    in section 2",

    "we get @xmath24 due to translation invariance we see that the propagator only depends on @xmath25 . if we consider a massive scalar field we just have to replace @xmath26 .    to get the propagator on the compact space we identify @xmath27 and sum over windings @xmath28 we can solve this sum , but it is more useful to consider the contribution of each mode . in the last equation we can see that for @xmath29 the propagator",
    "is exponentially damped , therefore loop integrals over momenta will be finite .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath30 , the propagator goes as @xmath31 when evaluated in @xmath32 . for these reasons , compactifying on a circle , we will obtain divergent contributions for the winding 0-modes , and finite contributions for the other modes .     and @xmath33 .",
    "in the vertical axis we represent the number of windings.__,width=302,height=56 ]    therefore , using the winding modes formalism , is very easy to separate divergent from finite contributions .",
