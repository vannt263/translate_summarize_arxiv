    "the agn / qso luminosity function and its evolution with cosmic time are key observational quantities for understanding the origin of and accretion history onto supermassive black holes , which are now believed to occupy the centers of most galaxies .",
    "since x - ray emission is one of the prominent characters of the agn activity , x - ray surveys are efficient means of sampling agns for luminosity function and evolution studies . an x - ray selected sample of agns is particularly useful because optical surveys often use point - like morphology as a criterion for selecting agns ( qsos ) among numerous other objects , and thus are likely to miss moderate - luminosity intermediate - high redshift agns embedded in their host galaxies .",
    "also , radio surveys sample only a minor population of agns .",
    "the _ rntgen satellite _ ( _ rosat _ ) provided us with soft x - ray surveys with various depths , ranging from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass , voges et al.@xcite ) to the _ rosat _ deep survey ( rds ) on the lockman hole ( hasinger et al .",
    "various optical identification programs of the survey fields have been conducted and the combination of these now enabled us to construct the soft x - ray luminosity function ( sxlf ) as a function of redshift .    in paper i. , we presented a number of global representations of the 0.5 - 2 kev sxlf and investigated the contribution to the soft x - ray background .",
    "we showed that our data are not consistent with the pure - luminosity evolution ( ple ) , contrary to the suggestions of a number of previous analyses ( e.g. boyle et al .",
    "@xcite ; jones et al .",
    "@xcite ) . instead",
    ", we find an excess of intermediate - redshift low - luminosity agns above the ple case , some sign of which was also recognized by page et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in view of this , we developed two versions of luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde1 and ldde2 ) models , which represent the observed data very well .",
    "an extrapolation of these two ldde models below the faintest limit of the survey ( @xmath1 @xmath2 $ ] ) yields significantly different predictions for fainter fluxes , bracketing the range of a possible agn contribution to the soft x - ray background .",
    "chandra ( e.g. mushotzky et al . @xcite ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "@xcite ) and xmm - newton ( @xcite ) are probing much fainter sources and spectroscopic identifications of these will eventually show which of these models is closer to the actual behavior of the agn sxlf .",
    "however , because at least some of the faint x - ray sources are optically too faint for spectroscopic identification even with the largest telescopes , extending the xlf into such faint flux level may be difficult .",
    "in this second paper , we present practical and convenient expressions of the observed sxlf from the _ rosat _ surveys .",
    "we present our results mainly for the investigators who are interested in particular redshift regimes and/or comparing their models with observations . for this purpose ,",
    "we show convenient analytical expressions in several redshift intervals separately .",
    "these give more accurate representations of the data in the redshift ranges of interest than those presented in paper i. we also tabulate the numerical values of the binned sxlf using an improved estimator .",
    "we use a hubble constant @xmath3 @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath5 dependences are explicitly shown .",
    "we calculate the results with common sets of cosmological parameters : @xmath6(1.0,0.0 ) , ( 0.3,0.0 ) . and",
    "@xmath6 ( 0.3,0.7 ) .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath7 '' represents the base-10 logarithm .",
    "we have used soft x - ray sources identified with agns with redshift information from a combination of _ rosat _ surveys in various depths / areas from a number of already published and unpublished sources .",
    "detailed description of the definition of the sample , _ rosat _ countrate - to - flux conversion , and survey area are shown in paper i. the summary of the samples , which is a duplicate of table 1 .",
    "of paper i with updated references , is shown in table [ tab : surv ] .",
    "the details of the nature and completeness of each sample were discussed in paper i. the limiting flux versus survey area relation were also shown in paper i.    ._rosat _ surveys used in the analysis [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : surv ] @xmath8 abbreviations  rbs : the _ rosat _ bright survey ( fischer et al .",

    "this excess smoothly connects with the sxlf of the non - agn population ( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the x - ray emission may be significantly contaminated by non - agn activities .",
    "the set of parameters which give the best fit for each redshift bin are shown in table [ tab : fit ] along with the results of the 1d- and 2d- ks tests ( see the notes of the table ) .",
    "the parameter errors correspond to a likelihood change of 2.7 ( 90% confidence errors ) . in any case , eq . [ eq : ana ] gives a statistically satisfactory expression for all redshift bins .",
    "the @xmath0 estimator , which is a generalized version of the original @xmath81 estimator ( schmidt @xcite ) applied to a sample composed of subsamples of different depths ( see paper i ; avni & bahcall @xcite ) , has been widely used for binned luminosity functions ( lf ; we use the acronym lf when the discussion is not limited to the luminosity function in the x - ray band ) in the literature .",
    "as discussed in paper i ( see also wisotzki @xcite ; page & carrera @xcite ) , using it for a binned lf estimator can cause significant biases , especially if the bin covers the flux range where the available solid angle of the survey changes rapidly as a function of flux .",
    "also , the choice of the location in a @xmath82 bin with a non - negligible width at which the data point is plotted significantly changes the impression of the plot . in fig .",
    "3 of paper i , however , we plotted the @xmath0 estimates , because of the lack of a reasonable alternative at the time of writing that paper , with caveats on biases associated with the method .",
    "we note that the estimator can be used in an unbinned manner by considering a set of delta - functions weighted by @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) at the positions of sample objects in the luminosity space ( schmidt & green @xcite ) , and this method is free from biases mentioned above . while this unbinned method is a powerful tool to predict , e.g. , the source counts , it does not provide practical means of plotting . in this paper",

    "another advantage of this estimator over @xmath225 is that exact errors at a given significance can be evaluated using poisson statistics .",
    "one disadvantage of this estimator is that it is model - dependent , at least in principle .",
    "since our analytical expressions are satisfactory representations in any case and the estimator is not sensitive to the details of the underlying model , the uncertainties due to the model dependence are practically negligible .    in order to compare the goodness of the estimators , we performed simulations . using the actual best - fit model for the @xmath226 bin for @xmath227",
    ", we generated a set of simulated agns .",
    "the number of simulated agns are 10 times those of the actual sample in order to reduce the poisson errors . using the simulated agns and the actual flux - area relation of our combined sample , we estimated binned sxlfs using three different estimators : @xmath0 , @xmath222 ( eq . [ eq : est ] ) and that of pc .",
    "the results are compared with the underlying sxlf , which was used to generate the simulated agns , in fig .",

    "for the models to evaluate @xmath86 , we used the re - fitted model using the simulated sample rather than the original model .",

    "the errors for the @xmath0 estimator are from eq .",
    "( 3 ) of paper i and are inaccurate for bins with a small number of agns .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compest ] , the @xmath222 estimator best represents the original model and no estimated point deviates from the underlying model by more than 2@xmath228 .",
    "the @xmath0 estimator underestimates the xlf in the lowest luminosity bin as found in pc .",
    "we note that the pc estimator also systematically underestimates the lf in this particular case of the underlying model and the flux - area relation .",
    "this is expected because their estimator implicitly builds in the assumption @xmath223 as the underlying lf shape .",
    "this is much more weighted towards higher luminosities than any part of the realistic agn xlf .",
    "since the amount of this bias depends on the underlying model and the flux - area relation , as well as the points in the bin where the data are plotted , it is not surprising that the bias is not apparent in fig . 2 of pc .",
    "they have also compensated for this bias upon comparing the estimated lf with a model . instead of correcting the estimated binned lf using a good model ( which our @xmath222 estimator does ) , they calculated the `` model - expectated value of the estimator '' to compare with the estimated value from the data . detailed investigation and comparison of these different estimators in various cases are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "judging from this simulation , the above discussion on biases , and that the exact poisson errors can be used for errors , we choose to use the @xmath222 estimator for our plots and tabulation .      using the @xmath222 estimator , we revised the full sxlf plot ( fig . 3 of paper i ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exlf ] . instead of connecting the data points , we overplotted the analytical model for each redshift bin .",
    "the resulting binned sxlf are listed in tables [ tab : xlf_f10 ] , [ tab : xlf_o3 ] , and [ tab : xlf_f3 ] for different sets of cosmological parameters respectively .",
    "the columns of these tables are  ( 1 ) the redshift range of the bin ; ( 2 ) the luminosity range of the bin ; ( 3 ) the number of agns in the sample for the bin and the number of non-``type 1 '' agns as defined in appendix a of paper i ; ( 4 ) the number of agns expected from the analytical model derived in sect .",

    "[ eq : est ] using the model xlf evaluated at the central point of the bin , i.e. @xmath229 ( see table [ tab : fit ] ) and @xmath230 , where the subscripts min and max signify the borders of the bin in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the upper and lower errors correspond to poisson errors estimated by eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 12 ) of gehrels ( @xcite ) respectively using s=1 ( corresponding to the confidence of the gaussian 1@xmath228 .",
    "when there is no object in the bin , the poissonian 90% confidence upper - limit is given ( corresponding to 2.3 objects ) .",
    "we recommend use of the values and errors under this column when , e.g. overplotting observed sxlf values with model predictions .",
    "figure [ fig : exlf ] shows that the lowest - redshift , lowest - luminosity bin has a significant excess over the two power - law analytical expression ( agns belonging to this bin have not been used for the two power - law fit ) , thus the actual underlying sxlf has a much steeper slope than that used for @xmath86 . in order to evaluate the bias caused by this , we have made an @xmath222 estimate of this particular bin using the _ local _ slope of @xmath231 instead of @xmath232 from the two power - law model .",
    "this gave a value about 10% lower , thus , the difference is much smaller than the statistical errors for this bin .",
    "we have shown the tables of observed sxlf values for a number of standard set of cosmological parameters .",
    "these values are intended for direct comparison with models and plotting with realistic error bars .",
    "however , we list a number of caveats and sources of uncertainties , and related issues .    * _ countrate - to - flux conversion : _ for the pspc - based observations , where we can limit pulse - height channels , the uncertainty in the countrate - flux ( in 0.5 - 2 [ kev ] ) conversion is small ( @xmath233 3% for photon spectral index of @xmath234 . at the faintest end ( @xmath235 ) , where only the hri data are available ,",
    "the conversion rate varies by @xmath236 for the same spectral index range . *",
    "_ optical classification of agns : _ since different catalogs used in this analysis have different criteria for type i and type ii agns , we did not show separate expressions for these two populations .",
    "see appendix a. of paper i for the approximate difference in behavior of the tentative `` type i '' sample . * _ incompleteness : _ most of the surveys used in the analysis are highly complete or we have selected an appropriate complete subset . in case",
    "there is incompleteness , we have corrected for it by assuming that the redshift distribution / content of the remaining sources are the same as the identified ones in the same flux range .",
    "this assumption is not likely to be the case , considering that they have not been identified not because of a random cause but because of optical faintness and difficulty in obtaining decent optical spectra .",
    "the only place that this could affect significantly is faintest end of rds - lh ( @xmath237 ) , where the identification completeness is @xmath238 .",
    "( at @xmath239 , the identification completeness is @xmath240% in any flux range ) .",
    "this could affect the behavior of , e.g. the apparent break at the low luminosity end in @xmath241 . * _ x - ray spectra / absorption : _ a serious model composer should be aware that the luminosity given here is for @xmath242 [ kev ] in the observer frame .",
    "thus , one should compare the model , with their own spectral assumptions ( spectral index , absorption , fraction of absorbed agns which may depend on luminosity / redshift ) , should compute the apparent luminosity in the @xmath11[kev ] range and compare it with the values listed in this paper . the latest population synthesis model based on absorbed and unabsorbed agns by gilli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) has applied this approach using the tables shown in this paper . however , as discussed in paper i. , the no k - correction case corresponds to a k - correction assuming a power - law photon index of @xmath243 , which is the most representative spectrum for the soft x - ray sources in the sample .",
    "thus for many purposes , considering our tabulated values as k - corrected sxlf would be accurate enough . * _ large - scale structure : _ the lowest redshift bin covers 0.015 @xmath244 0.2 and there is some concern about the effect of the large - scale structure of the universe , which could be confused with the effect of evolution .",
    "zucca et al .",
    "@xcite found an underdensity of galaxies in the local universe out to z@xmath245 0.05 .",
    "however , it might be because of the structure within their survey field of @xmath246 [ deg@xmath247 rather than that of the entire space out to this redshift .",
    "the solid angle surveyed by rbs is @xmath245 50% of the sky and the fields of sa - n are scattered in various directions . in any event",
    ", our lowest redshift bin samples a sufficiently large volume of space to @xmath248 with a uniform redshift coverage , thus it is unlikely that the calculated sxlf is significantly biased by the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "this work is based on a combination of extensive _ rosat _ surveys from a number of groups .",
    "our work is indebted to the effort of the _ rosat _ team and the optical followup teams in producing data and the catalogs used in the analysis .",
