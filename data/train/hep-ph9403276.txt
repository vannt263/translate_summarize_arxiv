    "in high energy @xmath5 collisions at hadron colliders , one sometimes produces high transverse momentum jets in the final state .",
    "here high transverse momentum means , say , transverse momentum greater than 20 gev .",
    "these jets are interpreted as the decay products of quarks and gluons ( partons ) produced by the hard scattering of two partons from the incoming hadrons .",
    "cross sections for @xmath6 calculated in qcd according to this picture match the observations well @xcite .",
    "normally the two hadrons @xmath0 and @xmath1 are broken up in this process .",
    "it is clear that this should be so , since a @xmath7 momentum transfer is quite sufficient to disrupt a hadron .",
    "nevertheless , in 1985 ingelmann and schlein@xcite predicted that events of the type @xmath8 where hadron @xmath0 is diffractively scattered , should occur with a small but not tiny probability . here by `` diffractively scattered , '' we mean that @xmath0 emerges with a fraction @xmath9 of its original longitudinal momentum and with a small transverse momentum @xmath10 .",
    "the transverse momentum transfer can also be characterized using the invariant momentum transfer @xmath11 from the hadron : @xmath12 .",
    "the picture for such diffractive hard scattering proposed by ingelman and schlein is that hadron @xmath0 exchanges a pomeron with the rest of the system , where `` pomeron '' means whatever is exchanged in elastic scattering at large @xmath13 , small @xmath11 . thus the cross section is proportional to the pomeron coupling to hadron @xmath0 as measured in elastic scattering .",
    "the pomeron carries transverse momentum @xmath14 and a fraction @xmath15 of the hadron s longitudinal momentum .",
    "here we do not need to know what a pomeron is , only that its momentum is carried by quarks and gluons .",
    "one of these collides with a parton from hadron @xmath1 to produce the jets .",
    "let the parton that participates in the hard scattering carry a fraction @xmath16 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming hadron @xmath0 , and thus a fraction @xmath17 of the longitudinal momentum transferred by the pomeron .",
    "then the cross section in this model is proportional to a function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is interpreted as the probability to find a parton of kind @xmath20 in a pomeron , where the parton carries a fraction @xmath21 of the pomeron s longitudinal momentum . in principle",
    ", @xmath22 can depend on the invariant momentum transfer @xmath11 , and it should also depend on a scale parameter @xmath23 that characterizes the scale of virtualities or transverse momenta in the hard parton scattering .",
    "several guesses for the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath24 were given in the literature @xcite , but ultimately it was left to experiment to measure these functions .",
    "an analysis of the theoretical expectations and of the approximate factorization hypothesis that is inherent in the model of ingelman and schlein was given in @xcite .",
    "the reaction ( [ dhs ] ) anticipated by ingelman and schlein has been seen at the cern collider by the ua8 experiment @xcite . however , the experiment suggests a feature not anticipated in @xcite .",
    "it was expected that the functions @xmath25 would have support only for @xmath26 .",
    "that is , some of the momentum fraction @xmath16 transferred from hadron @xmath0 would be lost , appearing in low @xmath27 particles instead of the jets .",
    "instead , the experiment suggests that a fraction of the events are lossless in the sense that @xmath28 .",
    "it is as if the formula for the cross section contained a term proportional to @xmath29",
    ".    it will be important to confirm the existence of a term that is proportional to @xmath29 or , more generally , that is singular as @xmath30 .",
    "the ua8 experiment demonstrates that something is present in addition to terms that vanish as @xmath30 .",
    "however , given the experiment s rather limited resolution , it is not clear to us that the experimental findings could not be fit with a function that is merely finite as @xmath30 .",
    "we shall present evidence in a forthcoming paper that such terms are to be expected @xcite .",
    "recently , the zeus and h1 experiments at hera have reported the first evidence for the analogous reaction in deeply inelastic electron scattering @xcite , @xmath31 here the diffractively scattered proton @xmath0 has not been seen , but there is evidence for the `` rapidity gap '' expected in such events .",
    "information on the @xmath16 and @xmath15 dependence of the cross section is not yet available .",
    "we will discuss hera physics later in this paper , concentrating on @xmath32 events in which the virtual photon has low virtuality , rather than high virtuality .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider some of the theoretical issues in light of the experimental results . in particular , we reexamine the factorization hypothesis of @xcite , and argue that this hypothesis is at best approximate .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with that of collins , frankfurt , and strikman@xcite , although our analysis of the source of the breakdown of ingelman - schlein factorization will be presented in more depth than that of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we frame much of the analysis in terms of a simple model that allows a detailed examination of the theoretical issues .",
    "our analysis suggests three conclusions .",
    "first , the factorization model with a `` distribution of partons in a pomeron '' may ultimately not be a fruitful way of understanding the process .",
    "second , the lossless events found in hadron - hadron collisions should be absent in deeply inelastic scattering .",
    "third , perhaps the most interesting conclusion suggested by the model is that if one examines the process @xmath32 as a function of the virtuality @xmath2 of the virtual photon emitted by the electron , then the lossless events should be present for @xmath33 but disappear gradually as @xmath2 becomes larger than some value @xmath3 . the length scale @xmath4 may be interpreted in the model as the transverse `` size '' of the pomeron .",
    "our discussion of the experimental possibilities at hera bears some resemblance to that found in a recent paper of brodsky , frankfurt , gunion , mueller , and strikman @xcite .",
    "these authors study @xmath34 , where @xmath0 is a proton and @xmath35 is a vector meson .",
    "they look at the region @xmath36 . as in the present paper ,",
    "large @xmath2 implies a small size for the wave function of the quarks produced by the virtual photon . as in the present paper ,",
    "these quarks couple to the proton via two gluons",
    "let us consider , as a definite example , the inclusive cross section for the production of two jets in a high energy collisions of two hadrons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "let the initial hadron @xmath0 have momentum @xmath37 where we denote @xmath38 and where we denote transverse vectors by boldface letters .",
    "similarly , hadron @xmath1 enters the scattering with momentum @xmath39 we specify the two jets by variables @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , given in terms of the four momenta @xmath43 and @xmath44 of jets @xmath45 and @xmath46 by @xmath47 the production of high transverse momentum jets is a hard process , to which qcd factorization applies . thus the total cross section for inclusive two jet production can be written as @xmath48 corrections to this asymptotic equality are suppressed by a power of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 represents a typical hadronic momentum scale , say 300 mev . here",
    "@xmath51 is the parton - level cross section , computed in perturbation theory with a certain prescription for removing infrared divergences .",
    "the functions @xmath52 are the parton distribution functions . notice that the born - level cross section @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath54 since , at the born level , all of the momentum carried by the colliding partons is transferred to the observed jets . in higher orders of perturbation theory , one will have @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the topic of this paper is inclusive jet production in which we make a very restrictive demand on the final state .",
    "we demand that hadron @xmath0 appear in the final state with momentum @xmath57 given by @xmath58 the invariant momentum transfer to hadron @xmath0 is @xmath59 for diffractive scattering , we require that @xmath11 be small compared to @xmath60 and that @xmath15 be small , say @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , one must look for diffractive hard scattering in the region @xmath63 .",
    "we thus consider the cross section @xmath64 in the region described .",
    "we begin our discussion of diffractive jet production by reviewing the model of ingelman and schlein @xcite .",
    "we follow much of the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , but break the presentation into two stages . in the first stage , we hypothesize that the cross section for diffractive jet production can be written in terms of a diffractive parton distribution : @xmath65 here @xmath66 represents the probability to find in hadron @xmath0 a parton of type @xmath20 carrying momentum fraction @xmath67 , while leaving hadron @xmath0 intact except for the momentum transfer @xmath68 . in the second stage , we hypothesize that @xmath69 has a particular form : @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the pomeron coupling to hadron a and @xmath72 is the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the function @xmath73 is then the `` distribution of partons in the pomeron . ''    in writing eq .",
    "( [ pomdist ] ) , one thinks of the pomeron as a continuation in the angular momentum plane of a set of hadron states .",
    "since hadrons contain partons , the pomeron should also .",
    "thus one has in eq .",
    "( [ pomdist ] ) the standard factors describing the coupling of the pomeron to hadron a , together with a distribution of partons in the pomeron @xcite .",
    "( [ factor ] ) , on the other hand , is more basic .",
    "it says only that factorization still applies when hadron @xmath0 is diffractively scattered .",
    "it is eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) that will be of concern in this paper .",
    "we shall argue that , in fact , factorization does not generally apply when hadron @xmath0 is diffractively scattered .",
    "in this section , we discuss the ingelman - schlein model in terms of the contributing feynman graphs .",
    "we first give a graph - based argument that the ingelman - schlein picture is plausible .",
    "[ diffjetfig ] shows a typical graph that contributes to diffractive jet production .",
    "the shaded circles represent bethe - salpeter wave functions for the two hadrons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the center of the diagram",
    ", there is a tree level contribution to the hard scattering of two gluons with momenta approximately collinear to the momenta of their respective parent hadrons .",
    "the hard scattering produces the observed high @xmath40 jets .",
    "the jets carry plus - momentum @xmath74 .",
    "the gluon that enters the hard scattering from hadron @xmath0 carries plus - momentum @xmath75 , which equals @xmath74 for born - level hard scattering .",
    "we may view this gluon as a normal part of the gluon cloud that accompanies any hadron .",
    "since only a small fraction @xmath63 of hadron @xmath0 s plus - momentum has been lost to the hard scattering , it seems plausible that the gluon cloud and the constituent quarks can reassemble themselves into the hadron bound state .",
    "it is only necessary to dispose of one more gluon , as indicated in the figure .",
    "then the net color transfer from hadron @xmath0 can be zero .",
    "if this gluon carries a small momentum fraction @xmath76 into the final state , then the net momentum fraction lost from hadron @xmath0 , @xmath77 , will also be small ( @xmath78 , say ) .",
    "similarly , the net transverse momentum @xmath79 transferred from the hadron can be small ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "( diffjet.epsf width 10 cm )    let us now compare fig .",
    "[ diffjetfig ] with a typical graph that contributes to pomeron exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ hadron - hadron elastic scattering at large @xmath13 and small @xmath11 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ pomeronfig ] . of course",
    ", the pomeron is much more complicated than this , so the reader is invited to imagine some much more complicated graphs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems an attractive proposition that whatever graphs contribute to the bottom half of the pomeron in fig .",
    "[ pomeronfig ] can contribute equally to the bottom half of fig .",
    "[ diffjetfig ] .",
    "( pomeron.epsf width 10 cm )    this graphical argument makes the ingelman - schlein model seem plausible .",
    "since the pomeron - proton coupling is large , the argument also suggests that the cross section for diffractive jet production at a given @xmath40 is not an infinitesimal fraction of the total cross section for jet production with the same jet @xmath40 . in this paper , however , we will focus on two other features of fig .",
    "[ diffjetfig ] , factorization and longitudinal momentum loss .",
    "first , we note that the top half of the graph is connected to the bottom half only at the hard scattering .",
    "the absolute square of the graph breaks up into a convolution of a factor that contributes to the distribution function of gluons in hadron @xmath1 , times a contribution to the hard scattering cross section , times a contribution to the distribution function of gluons in hadron @xmath0 , with the additional requirement that hadron @xmath0 is diffractively scattered .",
    "this is just the structure of the factorized cross section formula ( [ factor ] ) .",
    "thus the usual factorization program ( as described in @xcite ) is relatively straightforward for this graph ( although there are some subtleties related to the gluon polarizations ) .",
    "second , we note that , in order to get the color right , it was necessary to emit a gluon ( or more than one gluon ) into the final state .",
    "inevitably , then , some of the net plus - momentum @xmath81 transferred by the pomeron is not contributed to the hard scattering , but is lost into the final state in the form of low transverse momentum particles .",
    "thus the contribution to the cross section from graphs like fig .",
    "[ diffjetfig ] will be nonzero only for @xmath82",
    ".    consider , however , the graph of fig .",
    "[ diffjetmodfig ] . here",
    "the gluon that had to be emitted in order to make the color right is absorbed by a parton from hadron @xmath1 , which is moving in the opposite direction . as we will see in the following sections , the plus - momentum transferred by the extra gluon in this process is negligible compared to @xmath83 .",
    "thus the contributions from graphs like fig .",
    "[ diffjetmodfig ] will be effectively proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , graphs like this break the ingelman - schlein factorization represented by eq .",
    "( [ factor ] ) .",
    "as argued in @xcite , such factorization breaking effects cancel when one calculates an inclusive cross section to produce jets with no restriction on the final state",
    ". however , here there is an important restriction on the final state : we allow only final states consisting of an elastically scattered proton .",
    "thus factorization breaking effects may survive . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "a signature of these effects is the appearance of @xmath84 terms in the cross section .",
    "( diffjetmod.epsf width 10 cm )    in the following sections , we explain a simple model in which this effect can be examined in some detail . within this model , we find that the factorization breaking effect has some simple features .",
    "we abstract the simple features from the model and propose that one can test for these features in electron - proton scattering at hera .",
    "we will examine diffractive jet production within the context of scalar - quark qcd . in this model",
    ", there is an su(3 ) gauge field @xmath85 as in normal qcd .",
    "there is also a color triplet quark field @xmath86 with quark mass m , but we take @xmath86 to be a scalar field instead of a dirac field . since the theory includes a scalar quark field , a 4-quark coupling is necessary , but we set the renormalized coupling constant @xmath87 to a negligibly small value .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath88 this theory has the same behavior as spinor qcd for collinear and soft gluon emission from quarks .",
    "its chief advantage is that it allows a perturbative model for a quark - antiquark bound state .",
    "we introduce a scalar , color singlet meson field @xmath89 and couple it to the quarks using @xmath90 we work to lowest nontrivial order in the @xmath91 coupling @xmath92 , letting the @xmath91 vertex play the role that is played by the ( amputated ) bethe - salpeter wave function of a meson in spinor qcd .",
    "we denote the mass of the meson by @xmath93 and take @xmath93 to be smaller than @xmath94 , so that the meson can not decay into a quark and an antiquark .",
    "this model has been used for similar purposes in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    in the following sections , we examine diffractive jet production within the context of low order perturbative graphs in this model .",
    "the idea is to understand some of the basic physics by means of examples .",
    "we will be working with perturbation theory for the cross section at order @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "of course , the real strong coupling @xmath97 is not small except at large @xmath23 , and some parts of our graphs contain soft momentum flows , for which small @xmath23 would be relevant .",
    "we hope ( but do not prove ) that the basic lessons we learn here will be valid at order @xmath98 for any @xmath99 in the model , and at order @xmath100 in real qcd .",
    "however , such an analysis at arbitrary order @xmath99 remains a challenge for the future .",
    "the analysis that follows will make use of the null - plane wave function of the meson state in our model . for a meson moving in the minus direction ,",
    "the wave function @xmath101 is the amplitude to find that the meson with momentum @xmath102 consists of a quark and an antiquark of colors @xmath103 and anti-@xmath104 respectively , with the quark having minus - momentum @xmath105 and transverse momentum @xmath106 .",

    "first is the @xmath270 , which provides the experimental signature for the lossless contribution to the cross section .",
    "in contrast , the normal contributions yield values of the variable @xmath41 that are spread over the region @xmath291 .",
    "the second feature is that the factorization that applies to inclusive jet production does not apply here .",
    "the factor corresponding to hadron @xmath0 is tied to the factor representing hadron @xmath1 by a convolution over a transverse position @xmath277 .",
    "there is also a more complicated color and spin structure than in the normal contributions .",
    "we emphasize that the fact that factorization does not apply here does not represent a failure of the factorization theorem for the total cross section for @xmath292 .",
    "the factorization theorem requires an unrestricted sum over the final state @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "when we demand that @xmath293 contain the a diffractively scattered hadron @xmath0 , the conditions for the theorem are violated .    despite its rather complicated structure , the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is straightforward . in the model ,",
    "meson @xmath1 consists of a quark and an antiquark . with probability latexmath:[$\\propto    @xmath277 . in order to restore the color of hadron @xmath0 ,",
    "we must absorb a gluon on either the antiquark ( at position @xmath222 ) or the quark ( at position @xmath268 ) .",
    "since the quark and antiquark have opposite color charges , the absorption amplitude is proportional to the difference @xmath295 . here",
    "@xmath296 is the amplitude to absorb a color field quantum at transverse position @xmath297 when the `` active '' gluon is annihilated at the origin of space - time and hadron @xmath0 is diffractively scattered .",
    "thus @xmath92 describes the color field associated with the pomeron when one gluon from the pomeron has been annihilated at the origin .    here",
    "we meet an interesting experimental possibility .",
    "the @xmath297 dependence of @xmath296 reflects the transverse structure of the pomeron .",
    "it has significant structure on some distance scale @xmath4 characteristic of the pomeron . in the present model ,",
    "@xmath298 is of order of the quark mass @xmath50 .",
    "thus @xmath295 is small when @xmath299 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath300 is small when @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is a characteristic size of hadron @xmath1 .",
    "this size is also of order @xmath303 in the model . however",
    ", suppose that we generalize the model so that @xmath302 can be separately adjusted .",
    "then when @xmath304 , there will be a substantial contribution to the cross section proportional to @xmath305 .",
    "but when @xmath306 , this contribution will vanish .    so far , we have worked only with a simple model .",
    "but the model suggests a plausible conjecture .",
    "first , there can be a sizable contribution to diffractive jet production proportional to @xmath305 , arising from using one gluon from the pomeron to make the jets and absorbing on the partons of hadron @xmath1 the rest of the color field needed to make hadron @xmath0 back into a color singlet .",
    "second , when the size @xmath302 of hadron @xmath1 is small compared to the transverse size @xmath4 associated with the color field in pomeron exchange , then hadron @xmath1 should act as a color singlet and this contribution should disappear .    in order to test this conjecture , and probe the transverse structure of the pomeron , one needs to use hadrons of adjustable size .",
    "this is simple ( for theorists ) . at hera ,",
    "one manufactures bremsstrahlung photons from the electron beam .",
    "the virtuality @xmath307^{1/2}$ ] of the photon is measured by the deflection of the electron , and can be anything from nearly zero to many gev .",
    "the photon can collide with a proton ( hadron @xmath0 ) to make jets with @xmath308 .",
    "the cross section for this process can be ( roughly ) divided into two parts . in one part , the photon acts as a parton and scatters directly with a parton from hadron @xmath0 to make the jets . in the other part",
    ", the photon acts as a hadron , made of constituent partons . for @xmath309 ,",
    "this hadron is essentially a @xmath310-meson , with a size @xmath311 . for @xmath312 ,",
    "the `` hadron '' consists of a quark - antiquark pair , with wave functions given in eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) for transverse polarization and eq .",
    "( [ psil ] ) for longitudinal polarization .",
    "these wave functions are characterized by a size @xmath313^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath42 are measurable , this size is adjustable .",
    "thus the experimental possibility is to select photon - proton scattering events with @xmath314 in the range from zero up to one or two gev and look for jets accompanied by a diffractively scattered proton .",
    "these can be divided into events with a partonic photon ( @xmath315 ) and those with a hadronic photon ( @xmath316 ) .",
    "some of the events should be of the lossless ( @xmath317 ) type , while some most should be of the normal ( @xmath318 ) type .",
    "for the partonic - photon events , there should be diffractive jet production , but it should have @xmath291 , since the photon has no color structure .",
    "for the hadronic - photon events , both @xmath318 and @xmath317 events should occur , but the fraction of @xmath317 events should approach zero as @xmath314 becomes large .",
    "the scale of @xmath319 at which this happens reflects the transverse size of the pomeron .    in the model we have used ,",
    "the `` lossless '' contributions to the cross section are proportional to @xmath270 while the `` normal '' contributions are non - singular functions of @xmath320 .",
    "we expect that this clean division is not so clean when higher - order contributions are taken into account .",
    "presumably there are contributions that are singular as @xmath321 but are not as singular as a delta - function .",
    "thus one may anticipate that the lowest order @xmath270 appears as events with @xmath317 rather than @xmath322 .",
    "we must emphasize that the proposal given above is a conjecture based on a simple model , not a proven consequence of qcd .",
