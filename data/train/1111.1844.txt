    "the number of independent form factors drastically reduces in the limit of infinitely heavy @xmath5-quark mass , exploiting the approximate symmetries in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "additional simplification is expected in the kinematic limit of large recoil energy , @xmath6 , where the number of independent form factors is known to be reduced further @xcite , and part of the corrections to this limit should factorize in terms of process - independent hadronic quantities ( light - cone distribution amplitudes , lcdas , @xcite ) and perturbative interaction kernels , in a similar way as it has been discussed for the analogous mesonic transitions @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative calculation of the remaining hadronic transition form factors can , for instance , be obtained from qcd sum rules . in the limit of large recoil energy ,",

    "the aim of this paper is to provide a systematic analysis of @xmath0 form factors , starting from the symmetry relations in the heavy - quark / large - energy limit . to this end , in the next section , we will present a convenient definition of the 10 independent physical form factors , in terms of which the hqet and scet symmetry relations look particularly simple . in the following section  [ sec : sr ] ,",
    "we derive the leading expressions for the universal ( `` soft '' ) form factor @xmath7 from a sum - rule analysis of an appropriate correlation function in scet , involving the lcdas of the @xmath8 baryon .",
    "the same method is used to calculate the leading correction @xmath9 to the form - factor symmetry relations that arise from hard - collinear gluon exchange .",
    "in contrast to the mesonic case , one of the light spectator quarks still does not take part in the hard - scattering process , and therefore the corresponding effect could not be calculated in the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "( a similar discussion has been led for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in @xcite . )",

    "we also provide estimates for the partial branching fractions ( transverse and longitudinal rate , forward - backward asymmetry ) of @xmath1 in the large recoil ( small @xmath11 ) limit , before we conclude .",
    "finally , in our appendix , we collect the expressions for the double - differential @xmath1 decay rates , and discuss an alternative form - factor basis that is optimized for a systematic discussion of power corrections to the symmetry relations .",

    "in the following , we provide some useful definitions for @xmath0 form factors that aim to improve previous definitions , as discussed for instance in @xcite , in two aspects : ( i ) the form factors are defined from a helicity basis , ( ii ) the form factors are normalized to the limit of point - like hadrons . as a result",

    "all helicity form factors are thus equal to @xmath55 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "the leading corrections to the form factor relations from hard - collinear gluon exchange can be described by a form factor term that takes into account the corresponding sub - leading currents in scet , which contain one additional ( transverse ) hard - collinear gluon field @xcite .",
