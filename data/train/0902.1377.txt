    "the use of parity in atomic spectroscopy dates from the 1920s , when it was introduced as a wave function label , prompting wigner to demonstrate that such labeling is a consequence of the mirror symmetry of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "today parity and its violation are tools for probing aspects of the standard model ( sm ) ( e.g. , to isolate the strangeness - conserving hadronic weak interaction ) and new physics beyond the sm ( e.g. , the contributions of a new boson @xmath1 to the running of weak couplings ) .",
    "the weak interaction between atomic electrons and the nucleus is dominated by the coherent @xmath2 contribution . as the sm tree - level coupling to protons , @xmath3 ,",
    "is suppressed while @xmath4 , the weak charge of the nucleus @xmath5 is approximately @xmath6 .",
    "consequently @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the neutron density .",
    "the effects of this short - range interaction grow @xmath9 and thus are most easily detected in heavy atoms .",
    "atomic pnc was first observed in 1978 , while the best current limit comes from the 1997 jila experiment , @xmath10(@xmath11cs ) = @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13% precision poses a challenge for theoreticians attempting to calculate the associated atomic mixing .",
    "advances in the atomic structure calculations include improved evaluations of relativistic ( breit ) and radiative corrections , vacuum polarization , the neutron distribution , strong - field self - energies , and weak vertex corrections .",
    "the corrections have been at the sub-1% level for cs , and in total have brought sm calculations into agreement with experiment at @xmath14 .",
    "consequently beyond - the - sm contributions are constrained , yielding , e.g. , a bound on the mass of an extra neutral boson , @xmath15 tev @xcite .",
    "the atomic pnc constraint on @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or equivalently on the underlying quark couplings , is essentially orthogonal to that from pnc electron scattering experiments , as shown in the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : pves ] @xcite . in the left frame",
    "experimental values for @xmath18 are superimposed on sm predictions for its running @xcite .",
    "there is good agreement .",
    "included on this graph are the error bars experimentalist expect to achieve in future intermediate - energy measurements at jlab .",
    "are compared to sm predictions , normalized to the @xmath19 pole .",
    "the right frame @xcite shows the complementary constraints from atomic pnc ( @xmath20 ) and pnc electron scattering ( where protons have been the favorite target).,width=517 ]    the cs experimenters also studied the hyperfine dependence of the signal , from which a small nuclear - spin - dependent contribution to pnc , @xmath21 , was extracted , @xmath22 the measured @xmath23 , obtained from 7000 hours of data , constrains the sum of three terms , tree - level @xmath24 exchange ( @xmath25 , suppressed because the nuclear coupling is no longer coherent and the vector @xmath24 coupling to the electron @xmath26 is small ) , spin - dependent effects arising from the combination of hyperfine and @xmath10 interactions ( @xmath27 ) , and the nuclear anapole moment ( @xmath28 ) , which dominates the signal .",
    "the nuclear anapole moment is a pnc coupling of a photon to the nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : anapole ] ) , part of a set of weak radiative corrections .",
    "it arises from a pnc torroidal current winding within the nucleus , growing with atomic number as a@xmath29 ( proportional to the torroid s cross section ) .",
    "this growth leads to a the weak radiative correction that exceeds the tree - level axial @xmath24 exchange in heavy nuclei .        because the largest contribution to @xmath30 for a heavy nucleus comes from opposite - parity admixtures in the ground - state nuclear wave function",
    ", @xmath30 provides a constraint on hadronic pnc .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the cs anapole moment seems to be somewhat larger than one would expect based on other tests of hadronic pnc .",
    "the nn pnc interaction at low energies is characterized by the five s - p danilov amplitudes of table [ tab : pnc ] , which in turn are often parameterized in terms of a potential derived from @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 exchange @xcite .",
    "this parameterization can be viewed as a phenomenological effective theory , with the heavy meson exchanges playing the role of short - range interactions @xmath34 in each of the five s - p channels , and with the pion separately determining the long - range behavior of the potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : meson ] ) .",
    "in fact , systematic effective field theory formulations exist for pionless theory and with explicit pions @xcite .",
    ".s - p weak pnc amplitudes and the corresponding meson - exchanges @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : muon ]    both j - parc and fermilab have plans for next generation @xmath35 conversion experiments that will substantially improve limits on lfv .",
    "these experiments will use pulsed proton beams to remove pion backgrounds by timing , large - acceptance capture solenoids to increase the @xmath36 flux , and bent solenoids to transport the muons , removing neutrals and separating charge .",
    "the fermilab experiment will use 8 gev protons from a new driver and has a branching ratio goal of @xmath37 , while the j - parc experiment will use a 40 gev proton beam and has a goal of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this program will push lfv sensitivities for scalar exchanges from the current level of @xmath39 1 tev to @xmath39 10 tev .",
    "tests of total lepton number are important to the description of massive neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos are unique among sm fermions in lacking an obvious charge or other additively conserved quantum number that would reverse sign under particle - antiparticle conjugation .",
    "consequently , particle and antiparticle could be identical , @xmath40 .",
    "that is , the neutrino might be a majorana particle , rather than dirac ( @xmath41 ) . prior to 1957 the absence of neutrinoless @xmath42 decay appeared to rule out a majorana neutrino , since the process illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bb]a ) would lead to relatively rapid decay .",
    "this result seemed to require a ",
    "charge \"  lepton number  to distinguishing @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the assumption of conservation of that charge to account for the absence of @xmath42 decay , @xmath45 the process in fig .",
    "[ fig : bb]b ) would then be forbidden , as there are no leptons in the initial state , while the final state carries a net lepton number of two .",
    "but this conclusion ignores neutrino helicity : a massless right - handed neutrino has the wrong handedness to be reabsorbed in the second @xmath0 decay of fig .",
    "[ fig : bb]a ) .",
    "that is , absence of neutrinoless @xmath42 tells us nothing about the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrino if the process is independently forbidden by maximal pnc .",
    "decay scenarios : a ) the pre-1957 majorana case , which appeared to conflict with experiment ; b ) the dirac case , where the process is forbidden by lepton number conservation ; and c ) the majorana case , where the handedness mismatch is not total , due to the neutrino mass.,width=377 ]    the discovery of neutrino mass , however , changes this argument .",
    "handedness is no longer exact and thus does not forbid @xmath42 decay . instead",
    ", the rate is suppressed by a factor @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the typical energy of the exchanged neutrino , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : bb]c ) . if one can overcome this suppression factor by doing a very sensitive experiment , @xmath42 decay would be observed , provided majorana neutrinos exist .",
    "furthermore , the rate might tell us something about the scale of neutrino mass  important because oscillation experiments only probe @xmath48 differences .",
    "one might expect the neutrino to have both dirac @xmath49 and majorana @xmath50 components .",
    "the latter breaks the global gauge invariance @xmath51 associated with a conserved lepton number @xmath52 , and thus can contribute to manifestly @xmath52-forbidden processes like neutrinoless @xmath42 decay . as was discussed in concha gonzalez - garcia s talk ,",
    "there is a prejudice for such masses because they also explain , via the seesaw mechanism , why neutrinos are light . in the seesaw mechanism",
    "the diagonalization of the mass matrix @xmath53 provides the needed  small parameter \" @xmath54 that explains why neutrinos are so much lighter than other sm fermions ( which can only have dirac masses ) .",
    "thus light neutrinos are a reflection of the greater freedom available in building neutrino masses .",
    "current oscillation results suggest @xmath55 gev , a value near the gut scale .",
    "the possibility of discovering total - lepton - number violation is high because    * nature likely makes use of majorana masses ; * atmospheric neutrino experiments suggest that the mass scale is not unreasonably small , @xmath56 ev ; and * extraordinary efforts are underway to mount massive new @xmath42 decay experiments that will extend current sensitivities by an additional factor @xmath39 1000 .",
    "precise tests of symmetries and conservation laws , using low - energy techniques , remain one of our best windows on physics of and beyond the sm , complementing the experiments performed at the energy frontier .",
    "their utility derives from    * the many opportunities to isolate interesting interactions in both elementary and composite systems , using angular momentum , parity , and kinematics ; * exquisite experimental sensitivities ( atomic shifts of @xmath57 ev , @xmath42 decay lifetimes of @xmath58 years ) ; * level degeneracies and collective responses enhancing interesting interactions in atoms and nuclei ; * unique sensitivities , such as the gut - scale reach of @xmath42 decay ; * the improving intensities of muon and cold neutron beams ; and * the capacity of theory to connect what is learned at low - energies to both astrophysics ( e.g. , neutrino mass ) and accelerator physics ( e.g. , supersymmetry at the lhc ) .",
