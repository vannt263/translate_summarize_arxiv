    "recently , there has been an upsurge of interest in radio signal enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a typical swipt system of practical interest is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where a fixed access point ( ap ) with constant power supply broadcasts wireless signals to a set of user terminals ( uts ) , among of which some decode information from the received signals , thus referred to as information receivers ( irs ) , while the others harvest energy , thus called energy receivers ( ers ) @xcite . to meet the practical requirement that irs and ers typically operate with very different power sensitivity ( e.g. , @xmath0dbm for irs versus @xmath1dbm for ers ) , a receiver - location - based scheduling for information and",
    "energy transmission has been proposed in @xcite , @xcite , where ers need to be in more proximity to the transmitter than irs .",
    "however , this gives rise to a new information security issue since ers , which have better channels than irs from the transmitter , can easily eavesdrop the information sent to irs . to tackle this challenging problem , in this paper",
    "we propose the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter to achieve the secret information transmission to irs and yet maximize the energy simultaneously transferred to ers , by properly designing the beamforming vectors and their power allocation at the transmitter .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , we consider a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) swipt system with a multi - antenna transmitter , one single - antenna ir , and @xmath2 single - antenna ers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to prevent the ers from eavesdropping the information sent to the ir",
    ", we study the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum - energy transferred to ers subject to a secrecy rate constraint for the ir .",
    "this problem is shown to be non - convex , but we solve it globally optimally by reformulating it into a two - stage optimization problem .",
    "first , we fix the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the ir and obtain the optimal transmit beamforming solution by applying the semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) technique .",
    "next , the original problem is solved by a one - dimension search for the optimal sinr value at the ir .",
    "furthermore , we present two suboptimal designs of lower complexity , for which the directions of information and energy beams are separately optimized with their power allocation . finally , we compare the performance of the proposed optimal algorithm with that of the two suboptimal schemes by simulations .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite , a similar miso swipt system as in this paper has been studied , but without the secret information transmission . as a result",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that to maximize the weighted sum - energy transferred to ers while meeting given sinr constraints at the irs , the optimal strategy is to employ only information beams without any dedicated energy beam .",
    "however , in this paper we will show that with the newly introduced secrecy rate constraint at the ir , energy beams are in general needed in the optimal solution .",
    "the reason is that energy beams in this paper will also play an important role of artificial noise ( an ) @xcite to facilitate the secret information transmission to the ir by interfering with the ers that may eavesdrop the ir s message .",
    "it is also worth noting that an - aided secrecy communication has been extensively studied in the literature , where a fraction of the transmit power is allocated to send artificially generated noise signals to reduce the information eavesdropped by the eavesdroppers . since in practice ,",
    "eavesdroppers channels are in general unknown at the transmitter , an isotropic approach was proposed in @xcite where the power of an is uniformly distributed in the null space of the legitimate receiver s channel , while the performance of this practical approach has been shown to be nearly optimal at the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime in @xcite . furthermore , the miso beamforming design problem for the an - aided secrecy transmission under the assumption that eavesdroppers channels are known at the transmitter has been studied in @xcite .",
    "notice that this assumption is not practically valid if the eavesdroppers are passive devices .",
    "however , for the swipt system of our interest , since ers need to feed back their individual channels to the transmitter for it to deliver the required energy , it is reasonable to assume that ers channels are known at the transmitter .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] presents the miso swipt system model .",
    "section [ sec : problem formulation ] formulates the weighted sum - energy maximization problem subject to the secrecy rate constraint .",
    "section [ sec : optimal solution ] derives the optimal beamforming solution to this problem .",
    "section [ sec : suboptimal solution ] presents two suboptimal algorithms with lower complexity . section [ sec : numerical results ] provides numerical results on the performance of the proposed schemes . finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a multiuser miso downlink system for swipt over a given frequency band as shown in fig .",
    "it is assumed that there is one single ir and @xmath3 ers denoted by the set @xmath4 , where the ir is more distant away from the transmitter ( tx ) than all ers to meet their different received power requirements .",
    "suppose that tx is equipped with @xmath5 antennas , while each ir / er is equipped with one single antenna .",
    "we assume linear transmit beamforming at tx and the ir is assigned with one dedicated information beam , while the @xmath3 ers are in total allocated to @xmath6 energy beams without loss of generality .",
    "therefore , the baseband transmitted signal of tx can be expressed as @xmath7where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the information beamforming vector and the @xmath10th energy beamforming vector , @xmath11 , respectively ; @xmath12 denotes the transmitted signal for the ir , while @xmath13 s , @xmath14 , denote the energy - carrying signals for energy beams .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath12 is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and unit variance , denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath13 s , @xmath11 , are in general any arbitrary random signals each with unit average power .",
    "since in this paper we consider secret information transmission to the ir , @xmath13 s , @xmath11 , also play the role of an to reduce the information rate eavesdropped by the ers @xcite . as a result ,",
    "similarly to @xcite-@xcite , we assume that @xmath13 s are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "cscg random variables denoted by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , since the worst - case noise for the eavesdropping ers is known to be gaussian .",
    "suppose that tx has a transmit sum - power constraint @xmath18 ; from ( [ eqn : signal3 ] ) , we thus have @xmath19=\\|{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ v $ } } } _ 0\\|^2+\\sum_{i=1}^d\\|{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ w $ } } } _",
    "i\\|^2\\leq \\bar{p}$ ] .    in this paper , we assume a quasi - static fading environment and for convenience denote @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the conjugated complex channel vectors from tx to ir and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 s are assumed to be independently cscg distributed with zero mean and covariance matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath24 and @xmath25 s are perfectly known at tx .",
    "the signal received at ir is then expressed as @xmath30where @xmath31 denotes the additive noise at ir .",
    "furthermore , the signal received at @xmath22 can be expressed as @xmath32where @xmath33 denotes the additive noise at @xmath22 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath34 s are independent over @xmath35 .    according to ( [ eqn : signal1 ] )",
    ", the sinr at ir can be expressed as @xmath36while according to ( [ eqn : signal2 ] ) , the sinr at @xmath22 ( suppose that it is an eavesdropper to decode the message for the ir instead of harvesting energy ) can be expressed as @xmath37the achievable secrecy rate at ir is thus given by @xcite : @xmath38    on the other hand , for wireless power transfer , due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels , the energy carried by all information and energy beams , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 s ( @xmath11 ) , can all be harvested at each @xmath22 .",
    "hence , assuming unit slot duration , the harvested energy of @xmath22 in each slot is given by @xcite : @xmath41where @xmath42 denotes the energy harvesting efficiency .",
    "in this paper , we aim to maximize the weighted sum - energy transferred to all @xmath3 ers subject to the secrecy rate constraint at ir . therefore , the following problem is formulated .",
    "@xmath43where @xmath44 denotes the non - negative energy weight for @xmath22 , and @xmath45 denotes the target secrecy rate for ir .",
    "note that there are two conflicting goals in designing the information beamforming vector @xmath39 for problem ( p1 ) . on one hand , to maximize the weighted sum - energy , the power of the received signal at @xmath22 due to the information beam , i.e. , @xmath46 , is desired to be as large as possible . however , on the other hand , from the viewpoint of secrecy rate maximization according to ( [ eqn : ir sinr ] ) and ( [ eqn : er sinr ] ) , it follows that @xmath46 should be minimized at @xmath22 to avoid any `` leakage '' information . to resolve this conflict",
    ", we need to resort to the energy beamforming vectors @xmath40 s , since they not only provide dedicated wireless energy to ers , but also play the important role of an to reduce the eavesdropper s sinr in ( [ eqn : er sinr ] ) at each er .    before we proceed to solve ( p1 ) , we first study the feasibility of this problem for a given pair of @xmath45 and @xmath18 .",
    "this reduces to the case where no energy transfer is required and @xmath40 s play the only role of an . in this case",
    ", the algorithm proposed in @xcite can be applied to check the feasibility of ( p1 ) . without loss of generality , in the rest of this paper",
    ", we assume that ( p1 ) is feasible .",
    "next , we consider another special case of ( p1 ) when there is no ir . in this case ,",
    "@xmath47 and thus ( p1 ) reduces to@xmath48    let @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the maximum eigenvalue and its corresponding unit - norm eigenvector of the matrix @xmath51 , respectively . from @xcite ,",
    "the optimal value of problem ( p1-noi ) is known to be@xmath52which is achieved by @xmath53 , @xmath11 , for any set of @xmath54 s satisfying @xmath55 . in other words ,",
    "the optimal solution to problem ( p1-noi ) is to align all the energy beams to the same direction as @xmath50 .",
    "now suppose that the ir is added back to ( p1 ) . in order to achieve the same maximum weighted sum - energy @xmath56 , it is easy to show that @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath11 , for any set of @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 , must be a feasible solution to problem ( p1 ) . with this solution set , the maximum achievable secrecy rate ( if non - negative ) can be shown from ( [ eqn : secrecy rate ] ) to be    @xmath62    which",
    "is achieved by setting @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath11 . as a result , in problem ( p1 ) , if @xmath65 , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath11 , is the optimal solution since the maximum objective value @xmath56 is achieved and the secrecy rate constraint for the ir , i.e. , @xmath45 , is satisfied . without loss of generality ,",
    "in the rest of this paper we assume that @xmath68 in problem ( p1 ) to remove the above trivial case of @xmath65 .",
    "note that ( p1 ) is in general ( i.e. , with @xmath68 ) a non - convex optimization problem since both the objective function and the secrecy rate constraint are non - concave functions with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 s . in this section ,",
    "we propose an sdr - based algorithm to solve problem ( p1 ) optimally by reformulating it into a two - stage optimization problem .",
    "first , we have the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma1 ] for problem ( p1 ) , there exists a sinr value @xmath69 such that the following problem @xmath70has the same optimal solution to problem ( p1 ) .",
    "the proof follows easily by showing that for any given optimal solution of ( p1 ) , denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , it is also optimal for ( p1.1 ) with @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the optimal value of problem ( p1.1 ) with a given @xmath69 .",
    "then , we have the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma2 ] the optimal value of problem ( p1 ) is the same as that of the following problem @xmath75    a sketch of the proof is provided here , while the details will be presented in the journal version of this paper @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath77on the other hand , given any @xmath69 for problem ( p1.1 ) , it can be shown that any optimal solution @xmath71 and @xmath72 to problem ( p1.1 ) is feasible for problem ( p1 ) .",

    "the lemma is thus proved .",
    "let @xmath80 denote the optimal solution to problem ( p1.2 ) .",
    "lemma [ lemma2 ] then implies that with @xmath81 , problems ( p1 ) and ( p1.1 ) have the same optimal solution .",
    "therefore , problem ( p1 ) can be solved in the following two steps : first , given any @xmath69 , we solve problem ( p1.1 ) to find @xmath74 ; then , we solve problem ( p1.2 ) to find the optimal @xmath82 by a one - dimension search over @xmath69 . hence , in the rest of this section , we focus on solving ( p1.1 ) .",
    "note that ( p1.1 ) is still non - convex .",
    "define @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . by ignoring the above rank - one constraint on @xmath87 , the sdr of problem ( p1.1 ) can be expressed as @xmath88where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "if the optimal solution to problem ( p1.1-sdr ) , denoted by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , satisfies @xmath94 , then the optimal information beam @xmath71 and @xmath95 energy beams @xmath96 s , @xmath14 , to problem ( p1.1 ) can be obtained from the eigenvalue decompositions ( evds ) of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ; otherwise , if @xmath97 , the optimal value of problem ( p1.1-sdr ) only serves as an upper bound on that of problem ( p1.1 ) . in the following",
    ", we check whether @xmath98 holds or not for ( p1.1-sdr ) .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath119 in proposition [ proposition1 ] , it implies that in the case of @xmath130 , at most @xmath3 energy beams are needed in the optimal solution of ( p1 ) , i.e. , @xmath131 .",
    "the optimal solution to ( p1 ) proposed in section [ sec : optimal solution ] requires a joint optimization of the information / energy beams and their power allocation . in this section ,",
