    "photons also give a rather clear message on partonic patterns , in contrast to quarks and gluons which are not directly observable .",
    "only the last two point will be further discussed in this report .",
    "usually photons are called `` prompt  ( or ' ' direct  ) , if they are coupling to interacting partons , in contrast to photons from hadron decays or photons emitted by leptons . figs .",

    "the photon can interact directly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs]a ) or fluctuate into a hadronic state , part of which interacts with the incident proton ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs]b ) .",
    "there is substantial interest in the observation of prompt photons as they are more directly related to partonic interactions than jets and sensitive to the gluon content of the interacting particles ( resolved photon and proton , figs .",
    "[ fig : graphs]b ) and d ) respectively ) .",
    "they are an important background at searches at the lhc ( e.g. @xmath5 ) , and , as they are not strongly interacting , they help to disentangle in nucleus - nucleus collisions effects of initial or final state interactions , of a quark gluon plasma or hadron gas ...    various calculations exist in next to leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) based on next to leading order ( nlo ) matrix elements and , in most cases , collinear parton densities ( pdfs ) of the interacting particles . in recent analyses",
    "also @xmath6 factorised pdfs have been used  @xcite for @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions .",
    "further non - perturbative elements enter the calculations . besides the @xmath9 s indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] , there are @xmath9 s from fragmentation processes of quarks and gluons which are part of the calculated signal",
    ". detailed comparisons with experimental data require also simulation of the hadronic final state .",
    "first , because photons may be measured together with jets instead of inclusively , and second , because some experiments require an isolation cone for the measured prompt photons .    isolation of the prompt photon candidates is required in many experiments to cope with the large background of photons from @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay which may not be resolved as single @xmath9 s in calorimetric measurements .",
    "the prompt photon signal is then determined by sophisticated shower shape analyses .",
    "other experiments work without an explicit isolation condition and subtract measured @xmath10 and @xmath11 yields .     in the following a few recent results of experiments with characteristics given in table  1",
    "will be shortly discussed .",
    "recent results from h1 on inclusive prompt photons show that nlo calculations  @xcite describe the measured distributions well in shape , being however low by about 30% in normalisation , when corrections for hadronisation are applied using the leading order plus parton shower monte carlo ( mc ) programs of pythia and herwig .",
    "the mc generators themselves are also low by a similar amount .",
    "a similar discrepancy was observed in @xmath12 interactions by opal  @xcite .",
    "if a jet is required in addition to the prompt @xmath9 , the nlo description is good in various distributions ( see the figures in refs  @xcite ) .",
    "one may speculate , that here more lo like configurations are selected which may reduce the phase space for higher order emissions . see  @xcite for first results in dis .",
    "notoriously , there are difficulties to describe prompt photon production in pqcd , particularly at fixed target energies",
    ". for example the high statistics data of the e706 collaboration  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pe706 ] )      at @xmath16 and 39 gev are above nlo theory  @xcite by about a factor 2 at low @xmath13 .",
    "agreement is reached by an ad hoc smearing by an intrinsic parton @xmath6 of the protons @xmath17 gev ( see e.g.  @xcite for theoretical improvements by resummations ) .",
    "the deviations are smaller at high energies , but the cdf data  @xcite at @xmath18 tev show also steeper a @xmath13 dependence than predicted  @xcite . it is interesting to note that more recent cdf results  @xcite which are based on photon conversions are consistent with the former calorimetric  @xcite measurements with quite different systematics .",
    "however , the preliminary d0 data  @xcite from tevatron run 2 at @xmath19  tev are consistent with nlo theory  @xcite within errors .",
    "see  @xcite for di - photon results from cdf .    in nucleus - nucleus interactions , thermal photons",
    "are expected due to quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) or , at even smaller @xmath13 , from a hadron gas .",
    "[ fig : nucl]a shows the interpretation of the wa98 pb - pb data ( @xmath20 gev )      in terms of a convolution  @xcite of such thermal photon emissions with the pqcd treatment of nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "the high initial temperature of the plasma of 270 mev is lowered to 205 mev in other scenarios with additional @xmath6 smearing .",
    "definite conclusions are difficult to draw , due to the large background at low @xmath13 and the lack of @xmath22 data for a direct comparison",
    ".    prompt photons in au - au collisions at the higher rhic energies ( @xmath23 gev )  @xcite are consistent with scaling from @xmath8 collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nucl]b ) , in remarkable contrast to the strongly interacting @xmath10s , showing that their suppression in collisions with many participating nucleons is a final state effect .",
