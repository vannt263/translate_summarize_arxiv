    "in early studies of spin dynamics in magnetic fields , bloch and siegert considered the basic problem of the two - level system with a sinusoidal perturbation @xcite .",
    "the perturbation increases the level separation ( the bloch - siegert shift ) , and energy can be exchanged with the two - level system when the transition energy matches an odd multiple of @xmath0 ( bloch - siegert resonances ) , where @xmath1 is the oscillatory frequency .",
    "these effects have been studied with a dynamical hamiltonian @xcite ( the rabi hamiltonian ) , and also with a static hamiltonian @xcite ( the spin - boson hamiltonian ) in which the two - level system and oscillator are modeled as coupled quantum systems .",
    "these models have been of interest over the years for applications to physical systems , including spin problems @xcite and atoms in strong electromagnetic fields @xcite ; and also as standard model problems on which new approximation methods can be tested @xcite .",
    "we have been interested in such problems in order to better understand energy exchange between quantum systems with highly mismatched characteristic energies .    in this work",
    ", we address a generalization of the spin - boson problem in which a three - level system is coupled to an oscillator .",
    "our interest in this problem is focused primarily on the multiphoton regime , in which the characteristic energy of the oscillator is small compared to the available transition energies of the three - level system .",
    "while there exists a modest literature on coupled oscillator and three - level models @xcite , there does not appear to be available previous work relevant to the multiphoton region .",
    "the rotating wave approximation has been applied with success near low - order resonances @xcite , but one would not expect this approach to be helpful in the multiphoton region .",
    "the replacement of the two - level system of the spin - boson problem by a three - level system in the generalization of the model considered here very much complicates the problem .",
    "the convenient mathematical machinery of the spin operators and pauli matrices available for the spin - boson problem is now replaced by the less convenient su(3 ) operators and gell - mann matrices @xcite , and the diagonalization of the three - level system now involves a cubic characteristic equation .",
    "there can occur in addition level crossing effects in the three - level system in which the middle level is pushed through one of the other levels .",
    "faced with such difficulties , it is no surprise that the three - level version of the model has not received comparable attention as a workhorse problem in comparison with the simpler spin - boson problem .    here",
    ", we propose to use the more complicated coupled oscillator and three - level model to test an approximation scheme that appears to have worked well in the spin - boson problem @xcite , and also in the generalization to the spin-1 version of the spin - boson model @xcite . in this approach , the two - level or three - level system is diagonalized directly , treating the oscillator operators parametrically . the rotation which accomplishes this produces weaker residual couplings when applied to the oscillator .",
    "this rotation was discussed early on for the spin - boson problem by wagner @xcite . in the multi - photon region ,",
    "the energy levels of the full problem are well approximated away from resonance by simple averages over the parameterized diagonalized energy levels .",
    "we expect this also to be the case in the coupled oscillator and three - level system problem . in the first half of this paper",
    ", we develop the approximation explicitly and compare with exact results for a test problem , with the result that the approximation gives good results away from resonances .",
    "we found previously in the spin - boson model that we could understand the level splittings at resonance from a simple two basis state approximation using matrix elements of the residual interaction arising from the rotation of the oscillator .",
    "we are interested in whether this is also the case in the more complicated version of the problem under consideration here . in the second half of this paper",
    ", we develop the interaction terms explicitly and compare approximate level splittings with exact numerical results from a test problem .",
    "we find that the method works well for high - order resonances away from accidental or low - order resonances on other transitions .",
    "the coupled oscillator and three - level system , which generalizes the spin - boson model , can be described using the hamiltonian    @xmath2 @xmath3    0.10 in    in this model , the three - level system has unperturbed energies @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . transitions between the first two levels are described by a linear coupling term , where the interaction has strength @xmath7 .",
    "transitions between the second and third levels are also included through another linear coupling term , with interaction strength @xmath8 .",
    "such a coupling scheme is normally called a ladder or a @xmath9 configuration @xcite .",
    "we will also assume that    @xmath10    = 1.80 in = 2.00 in    [ t ]      in our earlier work , we used a unitary transformation to rotate the spin - boson hamiltonian in to a more complicated form which we wrote as    @xmath11    the rotation diagonalized the two - level model parameterized by the oscillator variable @xmath12 defined as    @xmath13    although the transformation introduced terms more complicated mathematically , the rotated hamiltonian was conceptually simple .",
    "the first term @xmath14 was found to produce a reasonably good approximation to the energy levels away from the anticrossings .",
    "the second term @xmath15 can be used to estimate the level splittings at the anticrossings .",
    "the third term @xmath16 is small in the large @xmath17 regime , as is the case here .",
    "we focus first on @xmath14 with the goal of developing an approximation for the energy levels away from the anticrossings . following the approach used in the spin - boson version of the problem ,",
    "the unitary transformation we use here is one which diagonalizes the part of the hamiltonian that does not include the oscillator    @xmath18    combining the different @xmath19 matrices that appear in the hamiltonian , we may write    @xmath20 @xmath21      an explicit construction of the unitary transformation could be done for the simpler spin - boson problem , but this is inconvenient for the three - level version of the problem that we are interested in here .",
    "nevertheless , we can still make progress by noting that the rotation accomplishes a diagonalization , which can be done by solving    @xmath22    this leads to a characteristic equation that is cubic    @xmath23    we denote the solutions to this cubic equation as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , defined so that    @xmath27    the solution of the cubic equation and expressions for the eigenvalues @xmath28 are discussed in appendix a. the unperturbed part of the rotated hamiltonian @xmath14 is then    @xmath29      = 4.50 in = 2.70 in    [ t ]    the diagonalization of the three - level system parameterized by @xmath12 produces energy levels that depend on @xmath12 , examples of which are illustrated in figure [ elevs5a ] .",
    "we expect static coupling between levels to push them apart , and in the calculation of figure [ elevs5a](a ) this is exactly what we see .",
    "however , since the interaction pushes levels apart , it is possible that one level may be pushed into and through another level .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ elevs5a](b ) , where the interaction between levels 2 and 3 is strong , and level one is weakly coupled . in this case level 2",

    "as one can see from figure [ ws ] , the complete spectrum is locally made up of three curves with the same pattern repeated over and over again with increasing energy ( where the energy offset is @xmath34 ) .",
    "the actual offset is @xmath0 , but we have only included the even parity ( even total index @xmath35 plus @xmath17 ) energy levels to make the figure simpler .",
    "the energy levels of the odd parity ( odd total index @xmath35 plus @xmath17 ) are nearly identical , shifted by one unit of @xmath0 .",
    "this periodicity occurs because in the large @xmath17 limit , the coupling of @xmath36 quanta is little different from coupling of @xmath17 quanta . under these conditions",
    ", the energy levels can be parameterized according to    @xmath37    the corresponding physical statement is that the oscillator impacts the three - level system strongly , causing the levels to shift ; while the three - level system has very little impact on average on the oscillator , so that its levels are not shifted .",
    "this situation is similar to that observed in the spin - boson problem when @xmath17 is large @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to try to understand the shifted ( or dressed ) energy levels @xmath38 , as these are fundamental to the model in this limit .",
    "we can develop an effective estimate for the energy levels away from the anticrossings using an approach similar to that used for the spin - boson problem .",
    "we base our approximation on the eigenvalues of the rotated @xmath14 problem which can be written as    @xmath39    we can separate the three - level degrees of freedom from the oscillator degree of freedom by using wavefunctions of the form    @xmath40    the @xmath41 functions satisfy a one - dimensional schrdinger equation of the form    @xmath42    this is similar to what we obtained in the spin - boson problem @xcite .      a useful approximation valued away from the level anticrossings",

    "when @xmath17 is large , we can take advantage of the wkb approximation to write    @xmath46    with @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath17 is large , the wkb approximation gives excellent agreement with the results from a brute force solution of equation ( [ h0problem ] ) , as was the case previously for the spin - boson problem .",
    "an algebraic expression in the case of the middle level is given in the appendix .",
    "to illustrate the approximation under discussion , we consider a specific example . in this example , we are interested in the basic question of whether the approximation described in the previous section is a good one away from resonance .",
    "however , since the three - level model and coupled oscillator problem is considerably more complicated than the analogous spin - boson problem , our task becomes more difficult .",
    "we focus on a three - level system with unperturbed energy splittings given by    @xmath48    with @xmath31 and ranging between 0 and 1 , and @xmath32 ranging between 0 and 1.2 ( we extend the range for @xmath32 since interesting features extend out a bit further along the @xmath32 axis ) .",
    "we expect that the approximation for the energy levels discussed above will be best away from resonances , so our first goal is to understand where resonances occur .",
    "the most important resonances are those involving transitions between levels 1 and 2 , and levels 2 and 3 . in the case of resonances involving the lowest two levels ,",
    "the resonance conditions is given approximately by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is odd .",
    "the associated contours are illustrated as a function of the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 in figure [ ee21 ] , based on the wkb approximation .",
    "when both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are small , it should take 11 oscillator quanta to match the transition energy since the energy levels in this case are only weakly perturbed . for small @xmath32",
    ", the dressed transition energy @xmath51 increases with increasing @xmath31 , so that more oscillator quanta are required for a resonance .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ ee21 ] in the resonance contours for increasing @xmath50 coming down to the @xmath31 axis . in the upper left of this figure ,",
    "things are much more complicated . as @xmath32 increases",

    "= 4.08 in = 2.90 in    [ t ]    = 4.80 in = 2.90 in    [ t ]    we can see the resonances in the results shown in figure [ eres21 ] taken from a direct computation using the original @xmath45 hamiltonian .",
    "one can see that most of the resonances predicted by the wkb approximation appear in the full computation .",
    "the resonance condition associated with transitions between levels 2 and 3 is given approximately by    @xmath52    where once again the number of oscillator quanta exchanged must be odd .",
    "this resonance condition from wkb calculations is illustrated in figure [ ee32 ] . for small @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 it now takes 13 oscillator quanta to match the transition energy , since in this case it is only weakly perturbed .",
    "when @xmath31 is small , an increase in @xmath32 pushes levels 2 and 3 apart , increasing the number of quanta required for a resonance .",
    "this situation is qualitatively similar as considered above , except that the axes are reversed .",
    "when @xmath32 is small , large values of @xmath31 can cause levels 1 and 2 to push apart strongly , driving level 2 toward level 3 . due to the asymmetry between the level splittings , this occurs for @xmath31 values larger than those for @xmath32 in the previous case for resonances between levels 1 and 2 . the resulting small separation that occurs in the lower right hand part of figure [ ee32 ] between levels 2 and 3 leads to the occurrence of low - order resonances , with the associated strong mixing and large level shifts due to the @xmath15 operator .",

    "<S> in previous work we studied the spin - boson model in the multiphoton regime , using a rotation that provides a separation between terms that contribute most of the level energies away from resonance , and terms responsible for the level splittings at the anticrossing . here , we consider a generalization of the spin - boson model consisting of a three - level system coupled to an oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a similar rotation and apply it to the more complicated model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rotation provides a useful approximation to the energy levels in the multiphoton region of the new problem . </S>",
    "<S> we find that good results can be obtained for the level splittings at the anticrossings for resonances involving the lower two levels in regions away from accidental or low - order resonances of the upper two levels . </S>"
