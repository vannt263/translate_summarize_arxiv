    "the determination of the rotational characteristics of galaxy disks is fundamental to understanding the role that dynamics plays in galaxy formation and evolution over cosmic time . over the last decade ,",
    "a large number of studies have addressed the issue of disk formation and evolution in current hierarchical cosmologies by means of analytical or semi - analytical theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a detailed characterization of the kinematic properties of observed disk galaxies at low redshift is of key importance to validate such models and place constraints on the properties of dark matter halos . in this context",
    ", special attention has been recently devoted to dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , i.e. systems with an internal kinematics that is thought to be dominated by dark matter even at small radii , thus allowing to best probe the inner structure of their parent halos ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for high surface brightness galaxies ,",
    "the kinematics is easier to measure , but the presence of a more prominent stellar disk complicates the analysis of the rc , whose decomposition into a dark matter and a disk component is generally not unique ( see , for instance , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the derivation of _ average _ rcs representative of the kinematic properties of a large number of local spirals is also important on its own , to provide a standard reference against which similar , distant samples can be compared .",
    "furthermore , statistical descriptors of the amplitude and radial variation of rotation velocity within disks would benefit all the applications that rely on the assumption of a rc model , such as determinations of rotational widths from spectroscopic data that lack velocity or spatial resolution .",
    "examples of the latter include internal kinematic studies of intermediate redshift spirals through spatially resolved optical spectroscopy , where synthetic rcs are needed in order to estimate the full velocity width ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "beginning perhaps with @xcite , many previous works have explored the variation in rotation curve form among galaxies . as larger samples of rotation curves",

    "pss96 showed that their average rcs were well described by an analytical form , obtained as the combination in quadrature of a dark matter halo and an exponential disk , with fit coefficients depending on galaxy luminosity only .",
    "based on these results they claimed the existence of a universal relation , the _ universal rotation curve _ ( urc ) , whereby the shape and amplitude of an _ observed _ rc at any radius is completely determined by the galaxy luminosity , as originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "according to the urc predictions , the most luminous systems have rcs that peak at @xmath00.8 @xmath2  and decline beyond that radius , implying a minor contribution of the dark matter halos to the internal kinematics of those galaxies",
    ". it should be also noticed , however , that pss96 s average rc tracings beyond @xmath2  are based on linear extrapolations of outer velocity gradients as functions of luminosity mostly obtained from  data .",

    "our intent is not to propose a new universal relation , but rather to obtain a more reliable characterization of the average rcs of late type , high brightness disk galaxies by taking advantage of a much larger data set , thereby negating the need for extrapolation within the optical disk . in order to allow a direct comparison with pss96 s average rcs and urc models",
    ", we provide template rcs parameterized as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we also present a set of templates which parameterize the distance from the center of a galaxy by means of the exponential disk scale length @xmath1 , a quantity naturally adopted in models of galaxy disks .",
    "this work makes use of a large spiral galaxy photometric and spectroscopic dataset , dubbed sfi++ ( see   [ s_sample ] ) , compiled to investigate the internal kinematics of disk galaxies at low redshifts , as well as to study the peculiar velocity field in the local universe via application of the tully - fisher ( tf ; * ? ? ?",

    "i_-band  isophotal photometric fits and rcs derived from long - slit optical spectroscopy for the mfb sample are available to us in digital form , and were reprocessed to achieve consistency with the rest of sfi++ ( photometric quantities and rotational widths have been extracted according to the methods described in @xcite and chg05 , respectively ) .    in this work ,",
    "we use the subset of galaxies in the sfi++ sample for which high quality long - slit @xmath3/ [ ] rcs and _",

    "template rcs were obtained by binning the galaxies in _",
    "i_-band  luminosity intervals , and computing the average rc in each bin as described below .",
    "two separate sets of solutions were derived by adopting different spatial parameterizations , in which the radial coordinates of the rcs are expressed in units of the _ i_-banddisk scale length , @xmath1 , or the optical radius , @xmath2  ( i.e. , the radius within which 83% of the total _ i_-band  light is included , as in pss96 . notice that @xmath2  is a cumulative quantity and not an isophotal radius ) .",
    "the template rcs were then fitted with the analytic function :    @xmath7    referred to as the _ polyex _ model @xcite , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 respectively determine the amplitude , the exponential scale of the inner region , and the slope of the outer part of the rc ( for template rc fitting , @xmath11 and @xmath9  are expressed in units of @xmath1or @xmath2 ) .",
    "equation  [ eq_polyex ] is an empirical expression that fits well a large variety of rc shapes ( including those declining at large radii ) , as discussed in chg05 .",
    "alternative fitting functions have been proposed by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; since they are all empirical , trade - offs between simplicity and detail result .",
    "a comparison between polyex and other fitting expressions is beyond the scope of this paper and will not be discussed here .",
    "all the individual rcs used for the derivation of the template curves were fitted using equation  [ eq_polyex ] and , although their polyex parameters were not used in this work , a quality code based on the goodness of the fit was used to select those included in the final sample . for reasons that will be clarified later ,",
    "the following objects were also not used to construct template rcs : ( a ) galaxies with inclinations to the line of sight @xmath12 ( see also  [ s_ext ] ) ; ( b ) galaxies with absolute _",
    "i_-band  magnitude lying outside the [ @xmath1324.0,@xmath1318.0 ] interval ; ( c ) rcs with spatial extent smaller than 2 @xmath1  or 0.6 @xmath2 , for the @xmath1  or @xmath2  parameterizations , respectively ; and ( d ) rcs with average velocity ( computed over the spatial interval @xmath14 , as defined in [ 3 ] below ) incompatible with the value obtained using all the rcs in the same luminosity bin ( over the same @xmath14 ) .",
    "most of the rejected objects fell into category [ a ] ( 472 out of 2777 galaxies in the initial sample ) . also , because of the selection criterion [ c ] , the sizes of the final data sets used to derive @xmath1  and @xmath2  template rcs , hereafter referred to as `` @xmath1  and @xmath2  samples '' , were slightly different , including 2155 and 2169 galaxies respectively . + after binning the galaxies by luminosity , template rcs were obtained as follows : + ( 1 ) _ folding _  each rc was folded about its center of symmetry , as determined by fitting a urc model ( pss96 ) to the unfolded rc . as pointed out elsewhere",
    "( see references in   [ s_intr ] ) , the urc parameterization is inadequate to model individual rcs , but it approximates the overall rc shape well enough for the purpose of determining its center of symmetry , as argued in chg05 , where our folding technique is described in detail . + ( 2 ) _",
    "rescaling and resampling _  the radial variable of each folded rc was scaled by the @xmath1  ( @xmath2 ) value of the galaxy , and the rc amplitude was deprojected to the edge - on view .",
    "inclinations were obtained from ellipticities measured from isophotal fits to the _ i_-band  images , and corrected for seeing effects , following the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "rc amplitudes were then resampled on a fixed spatial grid of spacing 0.1 @xmath1  ( 0.03 @xmath2 ) using a linear interpolation including the four observed points nearest to the grid position .",
    "this assures that rcs of nearer galaxies , with denser spatial sampling , do not bias the average rcs .",
    "we have tested that the results are not sensitive to the choice of the spatial bin centers .",
    "only the resampled rcs were used after this point .",
    "+ ( 3 ) _ normalization _  obtaining an average rc for each luminosity class requires attention to the fact that the rc of each galaxy is sampled out to a different maximum radius @xmath15 . to determine the average amplitude of the template rc of a given luminosity class , we thus used only the section @xmath14 between 2@xmath16  and 3@xmath16  ( 0.60.9 @xmath17 ) of each rc . over this interval , nearly all rcs",
    "are well sampled ( 91% of the rcs in the @xmath1  sample and 95% of those in the @xmath2  one extend beyond 2.5 @xmath16 and 0.75 @xmath17 , respectively ) and exhibit relatively mild gradients . using a range of radii rather than",
    "a single radial position also limits shot noise effects .",
    "the normalization of the rcs less extended than 3 @xmath1  ( 0.9 @xmath2 ) was performed using the available points within @xmath14 ( 29 rcs in the @xmath1  sample were normalized using the velocity at 2.0 @xmath1 ) . for each rc",
    ", we thus measured the average rotational velocity @xmath18 ; objects without a meaningful determination of that parameter have been excluded from our final sample . for a given luminosity class @xmath19 ,",
    "the template rc was obtained by scaling each rc by the ratio @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the average @xmath18 for the class ( objects with @xmath22 , corresponding to a 5@xmath23 deviation from the mean of the distribution for the whole sample , were discarded ) .",
    "the 1@xmath23 dispersion of the @xmath18 velocities is , on average , 17% of @xmath21 ( it varies between 14% and 22% among the different luminosity classes ; @xmath21 values are listed in tables  [ mbins_rd ] and [ mbins_ropt ] , presented in  [ s_res ] ) .",
    "we refer to the rcs scaled in this way as _",
    "normalized _ rcs .",
    "+ ( 4 ) _ averaging _  mean velocities and variances were computed ( after clipping at the 2@xmath23-level ) for each grid value of @xmath16  ( @xmath17 ) for which there were at least 4 valid samples , and for each luminosity class .",
    "the choice of 4 samples represents a good compromise between maximizing the number of radial bins for the computation of the template rcs and keeping enough points within each radial bin to calculate a meaningful average velocity . since the scatter of the rcs around the template",
    "is artificially reduced over and near the interval @xmath14 where the velocity normalization was performed , we replaced the velocity variance at each grid point ( over the entire spatial range covered by the template rc , not just @xmath14 ) with that computed using the unnormalized rcs . in other words , the template rc points were computed using normalized rcs , but the corresponding dispersions are those of the _ unnormalized _ rcs .",
    "+ ( 5 ) _ smoothing _  the resulting average rcs were hanning - smoothed , and every other point was recorded , yielding a grid spacing of 0.2 @xmath1  ( 0.06 @xmath2 ) . as mentioned above , each template rc point was computed by averaging at least 4 samples ( mean velocities resulting from the average of 3 or less points were not recorded ) .",
    "the final template rc points were obtained by expanding underpopulated spatial bins ( i.e. , bins resulting from the average of @xmath24 individual rc points ) in order to include at least 10 samples . positions and error bars of the expanded bins are given by the average of the corresponding quantities for the replaced bins .",
    "the binning into luminosity classes was initially done with a constant step @xmath25=0.4 .",
    "the bins at the faint end of the interval were expanded , however , to avoid the overlap of the corresponding template rc solutions ; in particular , two classes @xmath26 and @xmath27 were combined if @xmath28 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the final 10 luminosity classes span the _",
    "i_-band  absolute magnitude interval [ @xmath1324.0,@xmath1318.0 ] ( 18 objects with luminosities outside this range were discarded ) .",
    "the derivation of the template rcs was identical for the @xmath1  and @xmath2parameterizations , except for the values of the grid spacing and the normalization interval @xmath14 ( as in [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] above ) . for the @xmath2  template rcs",
    ", grid spacing and @xmath14 were chosen to match the corresponding @xmath1  ones , taking into account that the average value of the @xmath2/@xmath1  ratio is 3.31@xmath290.01 for the sample used to construct @xmath1  template rcs .    as discussed in ",
    "[ s_ext ] , the inner slope of observed @xmath3/ [ ] rcs depends on inclination , due to internal extinction in the inner regions of disks .",
    "the impact of dust attenuation is more severe for edge - on disks and for intrinsically brighter systems .",
    "for this reason , 472 galaxies with inclination @xmath12 were excluded from the analysis , as already mentioned .",
    "seeing may also systematically bias the inner slopes of observed rcs , especially for more distant galaxies .",
    "the set of galaxies used to construct the template rcs consists of relatively nearby , large spirals , of median recessional velocity @xmath07000 km  s@xmath6  and isophotal radius @xmath30 .",
    "we investigated a possible dependence of the shape of rcs on galaxy distance , and found no significant effect for objects in our sample . as another way of testing the impact of seeing on rc shape",
    ", we divided our sample into 3 intervals of ( linear ) disk scale length @xmath31 ( @xmath32 kpc , 2 kpc @xmath33 kpc , and @xmath34 kpc ) and recomputed the template rcs forcing the same velocity normalization obtained for the whole @xmath1sample ( as done in   [ s_ext ] for the inclination classes ) .",
    "we found that galaxies with larger @xmath31 s tend to have slightly larger rotational velocities than ones with smaller @xmath31 s ; however the effect is small ( well within the 1@xmath23 error bars on the template rc velocities . in particular , the maximum velocity difference is of the order of 20 km  s@xmath6  or less for the template rcs in the central luminosity bins , @xmath35 ; there are no galaxies with @xmath32 kpc in the two brightest bins , nor ones with @xmath34 kpc in the two faintest bins .",
    "larger velocity differences are observed for the @xmath36 case , but the @xmath32 kpc result is uncertain due to small number statistics ) and limited to the @xmath37@xmath1  spatial interval .",
    "figure  [ avgrcs_rd ] shows the template rcs expressed as functions of exponential disk scale lengths @xmath1 , obtained by averaging the data in each of 10 luminosity intervals .",
    "each curve is labeled by its mean _",
    "i_-band  absolute magnitude ( as listed in column 3 of table  [ mbins_rd ] , described below ) ; the interval @xmath14 over which the velocities are normalized within each luminosity class is indicated by dotted lines . for each template ,",
    "the outermost spatial bins have been expanded to include at least 10 elements ; hence their spacing from adjacent points is not exactly 0.2 @xmath16 .",
    "the error bars are poisson errors on the mean , calculated using unnormalized rcs ( see [ 4 ] in   [ s_sample ] ) .",
    "notice that the error bars on the outermost points may not be accurate due to small number statistics .",
    "polyex ( see eq .  [ eq_polyex ] ) fits to the template rc data points are shown as solid lines .",
    "our results show a smooth transition of rc shapes from small to more massive ( luminous ) systems , with the latter being characterized by a steeper initial velocity rise and a flatter outer slope . even in the case of the most luminous bins we see",
    "no convincing evidence of velocity decline _ within the spatial scales sampled here _",
    ", contrarily to what expected based on the urc predictions . in fact , while the very outermost points of the template rcs show a small velocity decrease in a few cases ( e.g. , those labeled @xmath1319.37 and @xmath1322.60 in the figure ) , there is no systematic trend that indicates a falling rc within at least 5 disk scale lengths ( 6 for the central luminosity bins ) . in other words ,",
    "if we were to determine the outer slope of each template rc by fitting a first order polynomial beyond 2 or 3 @xmath1 , none of the fits would have a negative slope .",
    "notice also that the curve labeled @xmath1321.80 appears to decline beyond @xmath05 @xmath1 , but the two adjacent templates ( @xmath1321.41 and @xmath1322.19 ) have rising outer slopes .",
    "this issue will be further discussed in   [ s_urc ] , where we compare our average rcs with those derived by pss96 , upon which the urc parameterization is built .",
    "lastly , we point out that the _ bump _ at large radii seen for the lowest luminosity template rc is caused by a lack of faint galaxies with extended rcs .",
    "in fact , bright galaxies in that luminosity bin ( i.e. , those with @xmath38 ) span all values of rc extent ( up to 6 @xmath1 ) , whereas fainter ones ( @xmath39 ) have rcs that extend up to 4 @xmath1  at most ( with only one exception , a rc with @xmath40 and @xmath15= 4.8 @xmath1 ) .    in order to illustrate the actual spread in rc shapes and amplitudes within each luminosity class , we include a version of figure  [ avgrcs_rd ] in which the error bars represent the dispersion around the mean ( figure  [ avgrcs_rd_stdv ] ) .",
    "typical values of the standard deviation around the mean are 13 km  s@xmath6  for the template rcs in the lowest 4 luminosity bins , 30 km  s@xmath6  for the one labeled @xmath1323.76 , and 20 km  s@xmath6  for the others .",

    "the difference between the corresponding values of the velocity normalization ( listed in column 4 of tables [ mbins_rd ] and [ mbins_ropt ] ) , is smaller than 3 km  s@xmath6  for all the luminosity bins except the @xmath41@xmath4623.8 one , where the discrepancy is slightly larger ( 5.4 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "a quick inspection of the two tables also reveals that the numbers of rcs belonging to the same luminosity bin are similar , but not the same , for the @xmath1  and @xmath2  samples .",

    "when scaled with @xmath2  rather than @xmath1 , the template rcs have flatter outer slopes . as for the @xmath1  solutions ,",
    "there are a few examples of templates whose outermost points show a small velocity decrease ( figure [ avgrcs_ropt ] ) ; however , there is no clear indication of declining rcs within the spatial interval sampled by our data , in the sense that linear fits to the outer regions of the template rcs ( beyond 0.6 or 0.9 @xmath2 ) would have flat or positive slopes .",

    "the solutions obtained with the two parameterizations are very similar , except for the tendency of the @xmath1  template rcs to show steeper outer slopes , as indicated by the larger values of the polyex parameter @xmath10 in the bottom panel of figure  [ pe_parms_rd ] and in column ( 8) of table  [ mbins_rd ] , compared with the corresponding results for the @xmath2  case .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in figure  [ avgrcs ] , where the two sets of polyex fits displayed in figures [ avgrcs_rd ] and [ avgrcs_ropt ] are reproduced as dashed and solid lines , respectively . excluding the @xmath41@xmath4623.8 bin , which is also characterized by the poorest statistics , the template rcs obtained with the two parameterizations are nearly indistinguishable within @xmath511 @xmath2 , whereas the @xmath1  tracings are systematically steeper than the @xmath2  ones beyond that radius .",

    "we investigated the origin of the correlation between @xmath2/@xmath1  and rc extent by binning the sample into four intervals with different disk central surface brightness @xmath53 ( measured from our _ i_-bandprofiles and corrected for galactic and internal extinction , cosmological k - term , and converted to face - on perspective ) , as indicated in figure  [ roptrd_sb ] , and by coding the objects based on their morphological types ( adopting the scheme in the rc3 catalog ; @xcite ) .",

    "i_-band  luminosity ( not shown ) . in conclusion , the systematic difference of slopes beyond @xmath51@xmath2between the two sets of template rcs in figure  [ avgrcs ] is largely caused by the high surface brightness part of our sample . in the region between 4 and 6.5",
    "@xmath15/@xmath1 , where the discrepancy is larger , the contribution to the template rc points is dominated by the objects in the two upper panels of figure  [ roptrd_sb ] , which are characterized by an @xmath2/@xmath1  ratio that is systematically larger than the average of the sample , especially for increasing values of @xmath15/@xmath1 .    in this section , we have presented template rcs expressed separately as functions of exponential disk scale lengths or optical radii . while the description in terms of @xmath1  is preferred for its more immediate interpretation in the context of galaxy structure and disk modeling , the @xmath2  parameterization is also provided in order to allow a direct comparison between pss96 s and our results ( see   [ s_urc ] ) . from an observational point of view",
    ", individual values of @xmath1  carry significant errors because of the difficulty of fitting exponential slopes in the presence of both spiral structure and radially - dependent extinction .",
    "being a cumulative parameter , @xmath2  is more straightforward to measure and is less subject to extinction effects .",
    "the complicating presence of a bulge would bias both measurements , in the sense that the estimated values would be systematically smaller than those determined for a galaxy with the same disk but no bulge .",
    "the impact on @xmath2  would be direct and much larger , possibly introducing morphological and/or luminosity effects .",
    "as mentioned in   [ s_sample ] ,",
    "galaxies with inclination @xmath54 were excluded from the sample used to derive the template rcs , in order to minimize the effects of the internal extinction on our results . here",
    "we address this issue in more detail , and motivate our choice of the inclination threshold for inclusion in the final sample .",
    "several works have previously presented evidence for internal extinction in the inner regions of disk galaxies , based on the analysis of optical and near - infrared photometry or spectroscopy .",
    "extinction affects an observed rc by causing its slope to appear shallower ; this effect , first noted by @xcite , is illustrated by the radiative transfer simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies show that dust attenuation has a severe impact on the observed kinematics of edge - on disks , even for modest optical depths , and that such effects are strongly reduced for galaxies that are more than a few degrees from edge - on , becoming entirely negligible for intermediate inclinations .",
    "these results were confirmed by the analysis of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter gh02 ) , which also showed that the prominence of the effect increases with disk luminosity . exploiting a substantial fraction of the sfi++ sample used in this work",
    ", gh02 showed that the kinematic scale length @xmath9  of the inner slope of a rc ( as obtained from the polyex model in eq .",
    "[ eq_polyex ] ) starts increasing noticeably for inclinations @xmath55 , the increase being larger for more luminous disks .",
    "by contrast , the outer slope @xmath10 of the observed rcs shows no dependence on inclination . adopting a simple model for the dust and gas distribution in spiral disks",
    ", @xcite were able to reproduce the observed trends in gh02 fairly well .    in order to evaluate the impact of internal extinction on our results",
    ", we divided our sample , which includes 472 highly inclined ( @xmath5680 ) systems , into 3 inclination intervals and recomputed the template rcs .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ incl ] for the parameterization in terms of exponential disk scale lengths ; only the inner regions are shown .",
    "each panel corresponds to one of the _",
    "i_-bandluminosity classes listed in table [ mbins_rd ] , from @xmath41=@xmath1323.8 ( a ) to @xmath41=@xmath1319.0 ( j ) ; different inclination bins are indicated as solid ( 30@xmath5770 ) , dotted ( 70@xmath5780 ) , and dashed ( 80@xmath5890 ) lines . the velocity normalization of the individual rcs in each luminosity class was forced to be the same as that used for the whole @xmath1sample , as listed in column 4 of table [ mbins_rd ] .",
    "figure [ incl ] clearly shows that : ( 1 ) the inner slope of the most edge - on systems is systematically shallower , and ( 2 ) the effect is more pronounced for more luminous galaxies and almost disappears for intrinsically fainter systems . in the case of highly inclined galaxies ,",
    "additional geometric effects can cause the inner slopes of observed rcs to appear shallower .",
    "such effects depend on the thickness of the disk ( higher values of disk thickness result in shallower rcs ) , which is a poorly known quantity , and can account for part of the difference between the highest inclination bin and the lower inclination ones in figure [ incl ] .",
    "the interplay between optical depth at the disk center and disk thickness is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the previous findings of gh02 ( as expected , since they provide a different representation of the same effect for essentially the same data set ) and of the other studies mentioned above , and show the importance of excluding the highly inclined disks from the derivation of the template rcs .",
    "in particular , our chosen threshold @xmath59 allows us to effectively eliminate the rcs that are most affected by dust attenuation ( and geometric effects related to the thickness of the disk ) , without discarding an excessive fraction of the sample .",
    "a similar derivation of average rcs of disk galaxies binned in _",
    "i_-band  luminosity intervals was undertaken by pss96 . their _ sample b _ included 616 rcs extending out to @xmath600.8  @xmath2  ( about 200 of which beyond @xmath2 ) , obtained by @xcite by deprojecting , folding , and smoothing the @xmath3  data of @xcite .",
    "the rcs in this sample were normalized to the velocity measured at the radius encompassing 65% of the integrated light ( approximately corresponding to 2.2 @xmath1  or 0.7 @xmath2  for a pure exponential disk ) , separated into 11 luminosity intervals , and averaged in radial bins of size 0.1 @xmath2 . in order to characterize the velocity field of galactic disks beyond the optical radius ,",
    "this data set was complemented by _",
    "sample a _ , a compilation of 131 rcs obtained from published optical or 21 cm -line spectroscopy .",
    "outer gradients of rcs , defined as the fractional variation @xmath61 of the rotational velocity between 1 and 2 @xmath2 , were calculated for 27 rcs in _",
    "sample a _ extending to about 2 @xmath2  ( mostly  data ) , and for 5 synthetic rcs obtained from the rcs in _ sample b _ , `` suitably co - added in order to probe the kinematics of the outermost regions . ''",
    "the variation of @xmath61 as a function of _",
    "b_-band  absolute magnitude was then used to _ extrapolate _ the average rcs out to 2 @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting rc tracings were fitted with a parametric form , obtained as the combination in quadrature of an exponential disk and a dark matter halo , and the fit coefficients expressed as functions of luminosity . based on this parameterization , shapes and amplitudes of _ observed _ rcs at any radius are completely determined by galaxy luminosity , implying the existence of a universal rc , as originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "the inadequacy of the urc to model individual rcs has been pointed out by several authors , as mentioned in   [ s_intr ] . here , we want to compare pss96 s average rcs in luminosity bins ( see their figure 4 ) with our template rcs parameterized as functions of optical radii .",
    "for this purpose , the polyex fits shown in figure  [ avgrcs_ropt ] are reproduced in figure  [ urc ] as solid lines , overlaid on the urc data points ( kindly provided by paolo salucci ) .",
    "since there seems to be a systematic offset between pss96 and our _ i_-band  luminosity scales ( the @xmath41  bins for the urc tracings are , from top to bottom : @xmath1323.2 , @xmath1322.3 , @xmath1322.0 , @xmath1321.6 , @xmath1320.9 , @xmath1320.5 , @xmath1320.0 , @xmath1319.4 , @xmath1318.5 ) , but the rotational velocity range sampled by our two samples is the same , we optimized the velocity match at the optical radius by shifting all the urc data points by @xmath6210 km  s@xmath6 . as mentioned in",
    "  [ s_sample ] , @xcite data set is included in our sample , but was reprocessed by us in the same fashion as the rest of sfi++ .",
    "therefore the discrepancy between absolute magnitudes might be due to a number of factors , including apparent magnitude measurements , extinction corrections , and distance estimates to the objects ( notice that the value of the hubble constant adopted by pss96 , 75 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , is very similar to the one used in this work ) .",
    "the comparison between pss96 and our average rcs should be carried out separately for the two spatial intervals below and above @xmath2 , due to the different nature of the corresponding urc points , as summarized at the beginning of this section . below @xmath2 , where the urc points were obtained by averaging rc data ,",
    "the agreement is fairly good , especially for the 5 lower luminosity bins ( in the case of the curves labeled @xmath1322.2 and @xmath1322.6 , one should interpolate between the two nearest template rcs in order to obtain one that matches the urc velocity at @xmath2 ) .",
    "there is however a systematic tendency for the urc tracings to have shallower slopes , in particular for the higher luminosity bins ( although their noise is larger ) , an effect that might be caused by the inclusion of edge - on systems in pss96 analysis ( see   [ s_ext ] ) . beyond @xmath2 , where the urc points were derived from linear extrapolations mostly based on data ,",
    "the agreement is good for the 3 lower @xmath41  bins and becomes increasingly worse at higher luminosities .",
    "in particular , the urc extrapolations for the curves labeled @xmath41@xmath6322 , characterized by slopes that vary from marginally to strongly _ declining _ , are inconsistent with our polyex fits .",
    "interestingly , the results obtained by pss96 by co - adding the rcs of their _ sample b _ in 5 luminosity bins show no indications of a velocity decrease within 2 @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the curve labeled @xmath41@xmath6422.6 in their figure b2 ( which would lie between the two uppermost urc tracings in figure  [ urc ] ) has an outer gradient @xmath65 , indicating a flat rc slope between 1 and 2 @xmath2 .",
    "as their figure  3 shows , the @xmath61 values for the 5 synthetic rcs are systematically larger than those derived for the individual objects in _ sample a _ ; however , they are also represented with very large error bars and said to be consistent with the others .",
    "the urc tracings shown in figure  [ urc ] ( with error bars removed for clarity ) are compared with the @xmath2  template rc data points in figure  [ urc_2 ] .",
    "the urc solutions qualitatively follow the trend of the template data in the lower luminosity bins , but do not recover the _ shapes _ of our average rcs at higher luminosities .",
    "for instance , the data points of the @xmath1323.8 and @xmath1323.0 template rcs lie _ near _ the urc predictions , but the latter clearly do not represent _ fits _ to the data . in other words , both inner shapes and outer slopes of those template rcs , as derived from best fits to the data points , are not reproduced by the urc tracings .",
    "the disagreement is particularly evident for the @xmath1323.8 template rc , where a linear fit to its outer region ( say , beyond 0.7 @xmath2 ) is clearly inconsistent with the strongly declining urc slope .    in summary ,",
    "our template derivation differs from that of pss96 in several details , such as the exclusion of the most edge - on systems , the resampling of the rcs to the same spatial resolution , and the normalization to a velocity that is both characteristic of the corresponding luminosity class and computed over a range of radii rather than at a single point .",
    "but most importantly , the larger size of our data set allows us to probe the velocity fields of the average rcs beyond 1 @xmath2  without reducing the number of luminosity bins and with no need for extrapolations . for radial galactocentric distances smaller than @xmath2 , where both pss96 and our derivations are based on a homogeneous data set (",
    "although differently processed ) , the results are fairly consistent , when the larger scatter of the urc data and different selection criteria are taken into account . beyond @xmath2",
    ", the urc extrapolations qualitatively agree with our data only at low luminosities , and are inconsistent for @xmath41@xmath6322 .",
    "pss96 based their extrapolations on a linear fit to the data points in their figure  3 , where the outer gradient @xmath61 is plotted as a function of the _",
    "b_-band  absolute magnitude . while it is unclear why the outer gradients of the 5 average rcs built from their _ sample b _ are larger than those of the other points shown ( mostly based on data ) , a fit to those 5 points would yield results in better agreement with our template rcs .",
    "we conclude that late type , high surface brightness spiral galaxies show no clear indication , _ on average _ , of declining rcs within at least 4.5 @xmath1  ( 6 @xmath1  for most of our @xmath41  bins ) , even in the case of the most luminous systems in our sample . of course",
    ", this does not contradict claims of declining rcs at larger distances in the disks .",
    "most notably , @xcite obtained extended  synthesis rcs for two highly - inclined , late spiral galaxies : ngc 2683 and ngc 3521 .",
    "their _ i_-band  absolute magnitudes , estimated from the _ b_-band  values using a color index @xmath66=1.78 appropriate for their morphological type @xcite , and adopting @xmath5 km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , are @xmath1320.6 and @xmath1322.4 , respectively . both galaxies exhibit declining rcs at large radii ( the  extends 15 and 12 optical @xmath1 , respectively ) , and are included by @xcite in the category of `` bright compact galaxies '' based on their small values of @xmath1 .",
    "the two rcs also show no decrease in rotational velocity within 6 @xmath1  and are thus consistent with our template results .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity of ngc 3521 , of the order of 240 km  s@xmath6 , is consistent with the corresponding template rc ; the fact that ngc 2683 , which is @xmath02 magnitudes dimmer , reaches the same maximum velocity is somewhat puzzling but not wholly surprising , given the expected scatter .",
    "extended rcs from  aperture synthesis observations were also obtained by @xcite for eight of the fastest known rotators , with the purpose of investigating the role of disk stability in setting the observed upper limit to the rotational velocities of spiral galaxies .",
    "this is a very interesting issue , since it is unclear that the most massive disks can be stabilized by the same processes invoked for less massive systems ; in fact , alternative scenarios have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) , one of which predicts roughly flat rcs @xcite .",
    "for the eight objects in her sample ( extracted from sfi++ ) , spekkens produced hybrid @xmath3 +  rcs with extents ranging from 1.8 to 3.3 @xmath2 .",
    "all these rcs are remarkably flat beyond @xmath2  ( about half showing a very mild velocity decline for @xmath67 @xmath2 ) and in qualitative agreement with our template solutions .",
    "taking advantage of a large sample of long - slit optical rcs with available _",
    "i_-band  photometry , we have reinvestigated the dependence of rc shape on galaxy luminosity .",
    "we determined _ template _",
    "relations by fitting a function , the polyex model ( eq . [ eq_polyex ] ) , to the average rcs calculated in 10 luminosity classes , spanning the _ i_-band  absolute magnitude range [ @xmath1324.0,@xmath1318.0 ] .",
    "after ascertaining the effect of internal extinction on our results , we excluded the 472 most edge - on systems ( @xmath68 80 ) from the analysis .",
    "the template rcs are expressed as functions both of exponential disk scale lengths @xmath1  and of optical radii @xmath2 , the latter to allow a direct comparison with pss96 s average rcs and urc predictions . when scaled with @xmath1 ,",
    "the template relations show a smooth transition of rc shapes with increasing _",
    "i_-band  luminosity , with the most luminous systems being characterized by steeper inner velocity rises and flatter outer slopes .",
    "the @xmath2  templates show analogous variations of rc amplitudes and inner slopes with _",
    "i_-band  luminosity , but their outer slopes are nearly constant .",
    "a direct comparison of the two sets of templates shows that the results are very similar within @xmath2 ; beyond that radius the @xmath1  templates have steeper slopes .",
    "this difference is mostly attributed to the high brightness galaxies , whose rcs are typically traced further out in the disks , and which are characterized by @xmath2/@xmath1  ratios larger than the average for the rest of the sample .",
    "we do not find convincing evidence for declining rcs _ within the spatial scales sampled by our data _",
    ", i.e. 4.56 @xmath1 , even for the most massive systems , in contradiction with the urc models ( which , beyond @xmath2 , are based on linear extrapolations ) . as argued in  [ s_res ]",
    ", there are a few examples of template rcs whose outermost points show a small velocity decrease , but there is no clear indication of declining outer slopes ( as they would be measured from linear fits to the outer regions of the average rcs beyond 2 or 3 @xmath1 , or , equivalently , 0.6 or 0.9 @xmath2 ) .",
    "one template rc ( the one labeled @xmath1322.60 in figure [ avgrcs_ropt ] ) does appear to be declining beyond @xmath01.1 @xmath2 , but the adjacent curves have rising or flat outer slopes . for less luminous objects or below @xmath2 ,",
    "our templates are qualitatively consistent with the urc tracings , when the larger scatter of pss96 s average rcs and different selection criteria ( namely , the exclusion of edge - on galaxies from our analysis ) are taken into account .",
    "being significantly larger than the sample upon which the urc is based , our data set allows us to compute average rcs that extend beyond @xmath2  without reducing the number of luminosity bins or resorting to extrapolations .",
    "our results are consistent with the declining rcs of @xcite , since the velocity decrease is observed in  data that span twice the distance sampled by our optical data , and with the hybrid @xmath3 +  rcs of 8 fast rotators studied by @xcite , which show remarkably flat or mildly declining outer slopes beyond 1.5 @xmath2 .",
    "based on our results we can not make quantitative inferences about the dynamic role of dark matter in galaxies , because optical rcs alone can not constrain the properties of dark matter halos on large scales .",
    "in fact , a detailed mapping of the radial distribution of visible and dark matter in galaxies requires the use of luminosity profiles and extended  rcs in addition to optical rcs .",
    "nonetheless , the comparison between figure [ avgrcs_ropt ] and the urc models suggests that dark matter plays a more significant role in determining the internal kinematics _ within the optical disk _ of the most luminous systems than what claimed by pss96 . at high luminosity",
    ", the profiles of pss96 s rcs show a strong velocity decrease between 1 and 2 @xmath2 ; their decomposition into a disk and a dark halo component in terms of the urc parameterization implies a modest dark matter content , whereas low luminosity systems are dark matter dominated . since the templates rcs of the high luminosity systems do not appear to decline over those spatial scales , their dark matter content within the optical disk based on the urc predictions might be underestimated .",
    "the template rcs , expressed by the polyex parameters as a function of galaxy luminosity , can be used to constrain models of the circular velocity field of disks , with applications that range from studies of dark matter content and kinematic properties of galaxies , to numerical simulations of disk formation and evolution within the current cosmological framework , and in general studies that , for different reasons , must rely on rc models .",
    "our parameterization in terms of disk scale lengths should prove especially useful in the theoretical and numerical modeling of disk structure and evolution .",
    "the results presented here will be used to determine statistical corrections for aperture bias of emission line widths obtained with fiber spectroscopy , such as those that the on - going sloan digital sky survey @xcite is collecting for one million galaxies .",
    "full rotational velocities of quiescent disk galaxies with apparent sizes larger than the fiber diameter can be statistically recovered by simulating the impact of the finite aperture on the observations , where the galaxy rcs are modeled using our template relations ( b. catinella et al .",

    "<S> the two parameterizations yield slightly different results beyond @xmath2  because galaxies whose @xmath3  emission can be traced to larger extents in the disks are typically of higher optical surface brightness and are characterized by larger values of @xmath2/@xmath1 . by either parameterization , these template rotation curves show no convincing evidence of velocity decline within the spatial scales over which they are sampled , even in the case of the most luminous systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to some previous expectations , the fastest rotators ( most luminous galaxies ) have , on average , rotation curves that are flat or mildly rising beyond the optical radius , implying that the dark matter halo makes an important contribution to the kinematics also in these systems . the template rotation curves and the derived functional fits provide quantitative constraints for studies of the structure and evolution of disk galaxies , which aim at reproducing the internal kinematics properties of disks at the present cosmological epoch . </S>"
