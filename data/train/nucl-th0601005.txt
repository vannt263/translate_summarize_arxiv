    "the rich variety of nuclear shapes far from stability has been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the variation of ground - state shapes in an isotopic chain , for instance , is governed by the evolution of shell structure .",
    "in particular , far from the @xmath2-stability line the energy spacings between single - particle levels change considerably with the number of neutrons and/or protons . this can result in reduced spherical shell gaps , modifications of shell structure , and in some cases spherical magic numbers may disappear .",
    "for example , in neutron - rich nuclei @xmath3 can become magic numbers , whereas @xmath4 disappear .",
    "the reduction of a spherical shell closure is associated with the occurrence of deformed ground states and , in a number of cases , with the phenomenon of shape coexistence .",
    "both the global shell - model approach and self - consistent mean - field models have been employed in the description of shell evolution far from stability .",
    "the basic advantages of the shell model is the ability to describe simultaneously all spectroscopic properties of low - lying states for a large domain of nuclei , effective interactions that can be related to two- and three - nucleon bare forces , and a description of collective properties in the laboratory frame . on the other hand ,",
    "since effective interactions strongly depend on the choice of active shells and truncation schemes , there is no universal shell - model interaction that can be used for all nuclei .",
    "moreover , because a large number of two - body matrix elements has to be adjusted to data , extrapolations to exotic systems far from stability can not be very reliable .",
    "heavy exotic nuclei with very large valence spaces require calculations with matrix dimensions that are far beyond the limits of current shell model variants .",
    "properties of heavy nuclei with a large number of active valence nucleons are best described in the framework of self - consistent mean - field models .",
    "a variety of structure phenomena , not only in medium - heavy and heavy stable nuclei , but also in regions of exotic nuclei far from the line of @xmath2-stability and close to the nucleon drip - lines , have been successfully described with mean - field models based on the gogny interaction , the skyrme energy functional , and the relativistic meson - exchange effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent mean - field approach to nuclear structure represents an approximate implementation of kohn - sham density functional theory , which enables a description of the nuclear many - body problem in terms of a universal energy density functional .",
    "this framework , extended to take into account the most important correlations , provides a detailed microscopic description of structure phenomena associated with shell evolution in exotic nuclei .",
    "when compared to the shell model , important advantages of the mean - field approach include the use of global effective nuclear interactions , the treatment of arbitrarily heavy systems including superheavy elements , and the intuitive picture of intrinsic shapes .    a quantitative description of shell evolution , in particular the treatment of shape coexistence phenomena , necessitates the inclusion of many - body correlations beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "the starting point is usually a constrained hartree - fock plus bcs ( hfbcs ) , or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation of the potential energy surface with the mass quadrupole components as constrained quantities . in most applications calculations",
    "have been restricted to axially symmetric , parity conserving configurations .",
    "the erosion of spherical shell - closures in nuclei far from stability leads to deformed intrinsic states and , in some cases , mean - field potential energy surfaces with almost degenerate prolate and oblate minima . to describe nuclei with soft potential energy surfaces and/or small energy differences between coexisting minima ,",
    "it is necessary to explicitly consider correlation effects beyond the mean - field level .",
    "the rotational energy correction , i.e. the energy gained by the restoration of rotational symmetry , is proportional to the quadrupole deformation of the intrinsic state and can reach several mev for a well deformed configuration .",
    "fluctuations of quadrupole deformation also contribute to the correlation energy .",
    "both types of correlations can be included simultaneously by mixing angular momentum projected states corresponding to different quadrupole moments .",
    "the most effective approach for configuration mixing calculations is the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) , with multipole moments used as coordinates that generate the intrinsic wave functions .    in a series of recent papers @xcite , the angular momentum projected gcm with the axial quadrupole moment as the generating coordinate , and",
    "intrinsic configurations calculated in the hfb model with the finite range gogny interaction , has been applied in studies of shape - coexistence phenomena that result from the erosion of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spherical shells in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "good agreement with experimental data has been obtained for the @xmath7 excitation energies , and b(e2 ) transition probabilities of the @xmath6 neutron - rich isotones @xcite .",
    "the systematic study of the ground and low - lying excited states of the even - even @xmath8 mg @xcite is particularly interesting , because this chain of isotopes includes three spherical magic numbers @xmath9 .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath10 shell closure is preserved , whereas deformed ground states are calculated for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the ground state of @xmath1 mg becomes deformed as a result of a fine balance between the energy correction associated with the restoration of rotational symmetry and the correlations induced by quadrupole fluctuations . in a similar analysis of the chain of even - even isotopes @xmath11ne @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the ground state of the @xmath5 nucleus @xmath12ne is deformed , but less than the ground state of its isotone @xmath1 mg .",
    "the model has recently been applied in an analysis of shape coexistence and quadrupole collectivity in the neutron - deficient pb isotopes @xcite . a good qualitative agreement with available data",
    "has been found , especially for rotational bands built on coexisting low - lying oblate and prolate states .",
    "another very sophisticated model @xcite which extends the self - consistent mean - field approach by including correlations , is based on constrained hf+bcs calculations with skyrme effective interactions in the particle - hole channel and a density - dependent contact force in the pairing channel .",
    "particle number and rotational symmetry are restored by projecting self - consistent mean - field wave functions on the correct numbers of neutrons and protons , and on angular momentum . finally , a mixing of the projected wave functions corresponding to different quadrupole moments is performed with a discretized version of the generator coordinate method .",
    "the model has been successfully tested in the study of shape coexistence in @xmath13o @xcite , and in the analysis of the coexistence of spherical , deformed , and superdeformed states in @xmath1s , @xmath14ar , @xmath15ar and @xmath16ca @xcite . for the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath13o",
    "this parameter - free approach provides a very good description of those low - spin states which correspond to axially and reflection - symmetric shapes , and allows the interpretation of their structure in terms of self - consistent @xmath17 states .",
    "a very important recent application is the study of low - lying collective excitation spectra of the neutron - deficient lead isotopes @xmath18pb @xcite .",
    "a configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected self - consistent mean - field states , calculated with the skyrme sly6 effective interaction , qualitatively reproduces the coexistence of spherical , oblate , prolate , and superdeformed prolate structures in neutron - deficient pb nuclei .    even though the self - consistent relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) framework has been employed in many studies of deformed nuclei , applications of meson - exchange and point - coupling models",
    "have so far been restricted to the mean - field level . in this work",
    "we report the first study of restoration of rotational symmetry and fluctuations of the quadrupole deformation in the framework of relativistic mean - field models .",
    "we perform a gcm configuration mixing of angular momentum projected wave functions that are calculated in a relativistic point - coupling model .",
    "in section [ secii ] we present an outline of the relativistic point - coupling model which will be used to generate mean - field wave functions with axial symmetry , introduce the formalism of the generator coordinate method , and describe in detail the procedure of configuration mixing of angular momentum projected wave functions . in section [ seciii ] our model for gcm configuration mixing",
    "is investigated in a study of quadrupole dynamics in the nucleus @xmath0hg , and @xmath1 mg is used as a test case for the configuration mixing calculation of angular momentum projected states .",
    "section [ seciv ] summarizes the results of the present investigation and ends with an outlook for future studies .",
    "in this section we review the self - consistent relativistic point - coupling model which will be used to generate constrained mean - field states , and the solution of the corresponding single - nucleon dirac equation in an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator basis . starting with a short outline of the generator coordinate method , we describe the technical details of the configuration mixing of angular momentum projected wave functions .",
    "most applications of the self - consistent relativistic mean - field framework have used the finite - range meson - exchange representation , in which the nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to exchange mesons and the electromagnetic field through an effective lagrangian .",
    "a medium dependence of the effective nuclear interaction can be introduced either by including non - linear meson self - interaction terms in the lagrangian , or by assuming an explicit density dependence for the meson - nucleon couplings @xcite .",
    "an alternative representation is formulated in terms of point - coupling ( pc ) ( contact ) nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite . in rmf - pc models",
    "the medium dependence of the interaction can be taken into account by the inclusion of higher order interaction terms , for instance six - nucleon vertices @xmath19 , and eight - nucleon vertices @xmath20 and @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] , or it can be encoded in the effective couplings , i.e. in the strength parameters of the interaction in the isoscalar and isovector channels . when employed in studies of ground - state properties of finite nuclei ,",
    "the two representations produce results of comparable quality .",
    "the point - coupling formulation , however , avoids some of the constraints imposed in the meson - exchange picture as , for instance , the use of the fictitious sigma - meson in the isoscalar - scalar channel .",
    "the self - consistent pc models are also closer in spirit to the nuclear density functional theory , in which the exact energy functional , including higher - order correlations , is approximated with powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities .",
    "the point - coupling representation , with medium - dependent vertex functions , provides a natural framework in which chiral effective field theory can be employed to construct the nuclear energy density functional , thus establishing a link between the rich nuclear phenomenology and the underlying microscopic theory of low - energy qcd @xcite",
    ".    a detailed description of the point - coupling model that we use in this work can be found , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , together with a thorough discussion of the choice of various parameter sets that determine the effective interactions . here",
    "we only outline the essential features of the model and of its mean - field solution for a deformed axially symmetric nucleus .",
    "the relativistic point - coupling lagrangian is built from basic densities and currents bilinear in the dirac spinor field @xmath22 of the nucleon : @xmath23 here @xmath24 are the isospin pauli matrices and @xmath25 generically denotes the dirac matrices .",
    "the interaction terms of the lagrangian are products of these bilinears .",
    "although a general effective lagrangian can be written as a power series in the currents @xmath26 and their derivatives , it is well known from numerous applications of relativistic mean - field models that properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , as well as empirical ground state properties of finite nuclei , constrain only the isoscalar - scalar ( s ) , the isoscalar - vector ( v ) , the isovector - vector ( tv ) , and to a certain extent the isovector - scalar ( ts ) channels . in this work",
