    "recent advances in the development of free electron lasers ( fels ) have led to the generation of intense , short duration , and short wavelength radiation sources ranging from extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) to hard x - rays  @xcite .    on the other hand , short wavelength fel radiation ,",
    "more often than not , produces highly charged ions in abundance  @xcite .",
    "typically , the stripping begins with the ejection of one or more subvalence electrons , but the physical processes that determine the course of events depend strongly on the photon energy range . for hard x - rays ,",
    "say above 2 kev , it is mainly single - photon inner shell electron ejections , followed by avalanches of auger decays and rearrangement , that dominate . by the time",
    "highly ionized species appear , with ionization potentials higher than the photon energies , the pulse is essentially over , which minimizes the possibility of two- or multi - photon ionization  @xcite .",
    "however , for soft x - ray energies , say up to 300 ev or so , the single - photon subvalence ionization eventually mingles , with ( non - linear ) multiphoton processes providing thus an unusual and theoretically demanding interplay between linear and non - linear processes . for currently accessible fel peak intensities , for which the ponderomotive energy is much smaller than the photon energy , consistent with @xmath3@xmath41 , and pulse durations of hundreds of field cycles , lowest non - vanishing order perturbation theory ( lopt ) , in terms of rate equations and multiphoton cross sections is a valid model  @xcite , in the entire fel photon energy range .",
    "although sequential ionization still plays a dominant role , an entirely different non - sequential mechanism of multiple ionization comes into play .",
    "the sae and recollision - based models are totally inapplicable in this context , because sequential ionization begins with subvalence electrons , for which the relevant cross sections , be it single- or multi - photon , involve inter- as well as intra - shell correlation . additionally , even within lopt , the calculation of multiphoton cross sections , which requires explicit or implicit summations over complete sets of intermediate states , poses a formidable computational challenge ; not to mention the further complexity introduced by the possibility of multiphoton multielectron escape  @xcite .",
    "experimentation with alternative methods , circumventing this task , is therefore highly desirable .",
    "as fel intensities are expected to increase and pulse durations be shortened , lopt is expected to lose its validity . in the soft x - ray regime , this is apt to occur for peak intensities above @xmath5 w/@xmath2 and pulse durations well below 5 fs at which point a non - perturbative approach will become necessary . as solving the time dependent schrodinger equation beyond the sae approximation is a daunting task even for two electrons  @xcite , time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) appears to be one of the few available options .",
    "since this represents uncharted territory , we have chosen to assess the potential of the method by applying tddft to the calculation of total ionization , as well as individual ionic yields for ne and ar , under photon energies 93 and 105 ev , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "we have chosen peak intensities for which lopt is demonstrably valid , in addition to the availability of some experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we are thus in the position to obtain a first assessment of the potential of tddft , before venturing into the non - perturbative regime .",
    "applications of tddft in the long - wavelength strong - field regime are relatively scarce .",
    "although steps in that direction , with mixed success , were already taken in the 1990s  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time tddft has been used in the interaction of atoms with short wavelength fel radiation .",
    "this is probably because tddft was previously thought to fail to describe strong field ionization under ir radiation , as it had limited success in accounting for the so - called knee in helium double ionization  @xcite . instead ,",
    "as discussed in the sections that follow , we find that tddft actually does provide a surprisingly good description of several aspects of the non - linear dynamics of atoms driven by strong soft x - ray radiation .",
    "the remaining discrepancies between lopt and tddft provide a road map towards further improvement , in preparation for the extension of the approach to shorter wavelengths and /or more complex systems .    in sec .",
    "[ theory : sec ] we briefly present the theoretical methodology to study the ionisation of ne and ar .",

    "[ results_discussion : sec ] we present the results and discussion for the total and individual yields obtained for ar and ne atoms exposed to a strong - field , short wavelength ( soft x - ray ) laser , as a function of the laser intensity .",

    "the central tenet of tddft is that all physical properties of an interacting many - electron system can be determined from its time - dependent density  @xcite . as in static dft  @xcite ,",
    "the interacting system is mapped  in principle exactly  nto an auxiliary , non - interacting system , the so - called kohn - sham ( ks ) system , which by construction yields the same time - dependent density as the interacting one . in the present work we are interested in the non - linear dynamics of closed - shell electronic systems , and for @xmath6 electrons",

    "we consider different xc  potential approximations : the local - density approximation  @xcite ( lda ) , pbe  @xcite and lb94  @xcite forms of the generalized gradient approximations , and the corrected - exchange - density  @xcite extension of lda ( cxd - lda ) .",
    "further , we employ the adiabatic extension of these functionals to the time dependent case .",
    "we model the laser - atom interaction within the dipole approximation using an external potential defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the polarization , @xmath16 the frequency and @xmath17 the field amplitude of the laser .",

( [ eq : vfel ] ) represents a simplified model compared to current fel sources which , in general , exhibit strong intensity fluctuations .      in order to estimate the total ionic yields , we follow the time evolution of the charge remaining in a given volume @xmath21 around the atom .",
    "the norm of each ks orbital inside this volume @xmath22 decreases in time during the application of a strong short wavelength laser pulse .",

    ".  @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the ionization probability is defined as the sum over all the combination of ks probabilities @xmath30 composing a @xmath28-charged state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the set of all the possible configurations @xmath33 in which an ( @xmath34)-tuple can be selected from a ( @xmath35 ) one .",
    "the total ionization yield can be reconstructed by computing a weighted sum over the different ionization channels . from lopt",
    "we directly obtain all the individual ionic yields @xmath36  @xcite and the total yield can be obtained with the same prescription . within tddft , we can directly obtain the total yield either by summing up the individual ionization channels or by monitoring the total charge . in either case , the total yield is the only quantity that is rigorously correct since it can be directly derived from the total density . to obtain the individual ionic channels , we need to assume that the ks wavefunction is a good representation of the exact many - body one .",
    "the validity of this assumption in the present context has to be evaluated on the basis of its success in recapturing results from different approaches and , of course , experimental data .      in the following we present results for strong field ionization of and atoms .",
    "we numerically propagate the tdks equations  ( [ tdks : eqn ] ) in real time and real space using the octopus code  @xcite . to this end",
    "we perform calculations in a 16  @xmath37 radius spherical box and discretize the problem on a cartesian grid with spacing 0.16  @xmath37 .",
    "an 8  @xmath37 thick boundary absorber  @xcite is introduced to account for electrons escaping from the simulation box , which therefore acts as an integration volume @xmath21 .",
    "core excitations are expected to play a relevant role for intensities much higher than the ones considered in this paper  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we freeze the core electrons into a pseudopotential using the troullier - martins scheme  @xcite for both atoms 1s electrons for ne and 1s , 2s , 2p for ar @xcite .",
    "we refer to appendix [ appendixa ] for more information regarding an assessment of the pseudopotential and the absorbing boundary used here .     for different laser intensities and ( a ) 5 fs and ( b ) 30 fs fwhm pulses of @xmath38  ev .",

    "fs and 153  fs respectively the overall agreement is remarkably good for all the xc  functionals in a wide range of intensities ( plots are in log scale ) .",
    "however , as the intensity increases , the agreement gradually deteriorates with tddft tending towards lower ionization yields .",

    "these effects become more severe for high intensities and build up for longer times because more electrons are ejected and the density changes are more substantial . for systems with more electrons",
    "we expect them to introduce some additional dynamical screening that can change the magnitude of these effects but not their presence .",
    "consequently , there are spurious oscillations in the successive ks ionization potentials leading to increasing errors as the system loses electrons ( see below ) .",
    "an error @xmath40% in the ks ionization potentials brought in by the pseudopotential for the strongly charged ions can not alone justify the observed effect .",
    "as lopt has shown itself to be in excellent agreement with experiment  @xcite , we deduce that our tddft results have a tendency to slightly underestimate the total ionic yield .",
    "it must be added , however , that the difference minor and likely to fall within the experimental accuracy of many fel experiments .",
    "therefore we conclude that tddft has predictive power a wide range of laser pulse intensities .",
    "not all the xc  functionals perform in the same way .",

    "the strongly ionized ar@xmath56 is here produced through a sequential ionization process involving a shakeup step where a photon ejects one electron in the continuum while leaving the parent ion in an excited state  @xcite . discarding this ionization pathway in lopt leads to an ar@xmath56 yield reduced up to magnitude with respect to experiment . in general",

    "since the two approaches are built on different bases , the resulting agreement indicate that both are able to provide a realistic picture of the underlying physics . in particular , this results in the demonstration of an unexpected predictive power of tddft in describing total and individual ionization yields in fel experiments .",
