    "more than two decades ago domany @xmath0 @xcite proposed a generalization of the two - dimensional xy- model where the shape of the usual @xmath1 type potential could be modified with the help of a single parameter .",
    "the two - dimensional spins located at the sites of a square lattice interact with the nearest neighbors through a potential @xmath2 \\label{poten}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the angle between the spins and @xmath4 is a parameter used to alter the shape of the potential . for @xmath5",
    "the potential reproduces the conventional xy - model while for larger values of @xmath4 the potential well becomes narrower",
    ". the conventional two - dimensional xy model does not possess any true long range order which is ruled out by the mermin wagner theorem .",
    "however a continuous quasi - long - range - order - disorder transition resulting from the unbinding of topological defects @xcite is known to occur in this system and the order parameter correlation function is characterized by a slow algebraic decay instead of the fast exponential decay observed in a disordered system and this is referred to as the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition in literature .",
    "domany @xmath0 @xcite performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and observed that as the potential well gets narrower with the increase in the parameter @xmath4 , the continuous transition gets converted into a first order phase transition and for @xmath6 the transition is very sharp as is manifested by a huge peak in the specific heat .",
    "this phenomenon is in apparent contradiction with the prediction of the renormalization group theory according to which systems in the same universal class ( having same symmetry of the order parameter and same lattice dimensionality ) should exhibit the same type of phase transition with identical values of critical exponents .",
    "the generalized xy - model of eqn.([poten ] ) has been analyzed by a number of authors @xcite using the renormalization approach of the migdal - kadanoff type .",
    "these investigators were of the opinion that the transition in the generalized xy - model appears to be first order in nature because the mc simulation of domany @xmath0 @xcite and himbergen @xcite were carried out on relatively small lattices and for large system sizes the usual kt transition is expected to occur .",
    "nearly a decade later , mila @xcite using the same sort of renormalization group analysis arrived at a similar conclusion .",
    "lastly , using the same line of approach , garel @xmath0 @xcite put forward a different type of interpretation of the above mentioned rg analysis and were of the view that the transition is indeed first order .",
    "minnhagen @xcite has carried out a detailed study of the behavior of the phase transition exhibited by a 2-d coulomb gas , which very well describes the characteristics of a 2-d system consisting of vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "it was demonstrated that the kt behavior is obtainable in a 2-d coulomb gas only at low particle densities . for higher particle densities",
    "the charge unbinding transition was shown to be first order .",
    "also a new gas - liquid like critical point was found in the 2-d coulomb gas  the first order line in the temperature - particle density plane ends at a critical point .",
    "the kt transition line , obtainable at lower densities was seen to join smoothly with the first order line at a temperature slightly lower than the critical point .",
    "jonsson , minnhagen and nylen @xcite performed mc simulation in a 2-d xy - model with a modified potential , which essentially is equivalent to that of eqn.([poten ] ) and established a new critical point .",
    "they determined the critical exponents for the system and interpreted the transition to be of the vortex unbinding type .",
    "van enter and shlosman @xcite presented a rigorous proof that various so(n)-invariant n - vector models which have a deep and narrow potential well , would exhibit a first order transition .",
    "the model represented by eqn.([poten ] ) is a member of this general class of systems .",
    "these authors based their proof on the so called method of reflection positivity , a technique borrowed from the field theory and used in statistical mechanics .",
    "van enter and shlosman argued that in spite of the order parameter in 2-d n - vector model being predicted to vanish by the mermin - wagner theorem , long range order prevails in the system via higher order correlation functions .",
    "more recently , s. ota and s. b. ota @xcite have performed mc simulation of the modified xy- model using microcanonical ensemble and have identified a first order phase transition in the system .",
    "the present article describes mc simulation of the 2-d modified xy - model where computations have been performed on systems of reasonably large size and finite size scaling rules for first order phase transition have been tested on the results of the simulation .",
    "the motivation is to resolve the question on the nature of the phase transition in this model and the contradictions among the views put forward by different investigators for the last quarter of a century as has been summed up above .",
    "our observation is that the transition is indeed first order for a large value of the parameter @xmath4 ( we have used @xmath6 ) as all finite size scaling rules are nicely obeyed .",
    "we however have made no attempt to investigate the existence of the critical point in this model or to determine the critical exponents as has been done by jonsson @xmath0 @xcite in relatively small systems . among other observables",
    "we have computed the spin - spin angular correlation functions of different orders .",
    "we observe that while the lowest order correlation function decays to zero , the next higher order correlation function has a finite plateau which is in accordance with statement of van enter and sholsman @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of our work is the application of the wolff cluster algorithm @xcite to simulate the model .",
    "it has been pointed out by a numbers of workers @xcite that the two - dimensional model is difficult to simulate using the conventional single spin flip metropolis algorithm @xcite . to increase the reliability of the results we have used the multiple histogram reweighting , due to ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite along with the lee and kosterlitz s method @xcite of finite size scaling for a first order phase transition .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation was carried out on a square lattice of dimension @xmath7 with the two - dimensional spins located at each site and interacting with the nearest neighbors via the hamiltonian @xmath8\\ ] ] the specific heat at a dimensionless temperature @xmath9 is related to the energy fluctuation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of spins .",
    "the conventional long range order parameter is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angle that a spin makes with the preferred direction of orientation and the average is over the entire sample .",
    "the next higher rank order parameter is defined as @xmath14 the order parameter susceptibility is defined in terms of the fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath15 @xmath16 the first rank pair correlation coefficient is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two spins separated by a distance @xmath20 . the second rank pair correlation coefficient is defined as @xmath21",
    "in this section we briefly describe the wolff cluster algorithm , the ferrenberg - swendsen multiple histogram reweighting technique and the lee - kosterlitz finite size scaling for first order phase transition .",
    "the monte - carlo(mc ) simulations were performed on square lattices of size @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have used wolff s cluster flip algorithm , the essential steps of which are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) a random unit vector @xmath30 is taken and a spin flip @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32    \\(2 ) bonds @xmath33 of the lattice are activated with a probability @xmath34  where ,    @xmath35     this process leads to the formation of a cluster on the lattice .",
    "\\(3 ) all spins in a cluster are now flipped according to @xmath31    we have calculated the thermodynamic quantities using multiple histogram reweighting technique of ferrenberg and swendsen @xcite , which is briefly described below .",

    "energy histograms are generated at a number of temperatures @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the histogram count for the @xmath43 temperature .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the total number of configurations generated in the @xmath43 simulation , i.e , @xmath45 . according to references @xcite and @xcite , the best estimate of the density of states , obtained after histogram reweighting ,",

    "the factors @xmath63 now correspond to the observable @xmath58 .",
    "lee and kosterlitz @xcite proposed a convenient method for the determination of the order of the phase transition which can be applied to systems having linear dimension less than the correlation length .",
    "for a temperature driven first order transition in a finite system of volume @xmath64 with periodic boundary condition one needs to compute the histogram count of the energy distribution denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath6 model has a characteristic double peak structure for @xmath65 in the neighborhood of the transition temperature .",
    "the two peaks of @xmath11 at @xmath66 and @xmath67 corresponding respectively to the ordered and disordered phases are separated by a minimum at @xmath68 .",
    "a free - energy - like quantity is defined as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of configurations generated .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 differs from the free energy @xmath72 by a temperature and @xmath70 dependent additive quantity .",
    "a bulk free energy barrier can therefore be defined as @xmath73 it may be noted that at the transition temperature , @xmath74 and @xmath75 is independent of @xmath70 . for a continuous transition",
    "@xmath76 is independent of @xmath77 and for a temperature driven first order transition it is an increasing function of @xmath77 , even when @xmath77 is smaller than the correlation length , @xmath78 , prevailing at the system at the transition temperature .",
    "if one is in a region where @xmath77 is much greater than @xmath78 , then @xmath75 obeys the scaling relation @xcite @xmath79 clearly , the temperature at which the double - well structure of @xmath80 has two equally deep minima gives a precise estimation of the transition temperature .",
    "square lattices of linear dimension @xmath77 ranging from @xmath81 to @xmath29 were simulated and for each lattice simulations were performed at @xmath82 to @xmath83 temperatures in the neighborhood of the transition to record the histograms for energy . in table",
    "[ data ] we have depicted for each lattice size and temperature the technical quantities of interest .",
    "these include the number of wolff clusters generated @xmath84 , the percentage of average cluster size in units of lattice size for each temperature @xmath85 , the number of equivalent monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) and the energy auto - correlation time @xmath86 .",
    "the number of configurations generated ranges from about @xmath87 to @xmath88 . in fig.[size4 ] we have plotted the percentage of average cluster size in units of the lattice size @xmath85 against temperature for @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear that the average cluster size for a given lattice , decreases with increase in temperature and there is a sharp fall at the transition .",
    "the maximum cluster size in units of the lattice size is about @xmath90 ( for @xmath23 ) and is seen to decrease with increase in the system size .",
    "the auto - correlation time , which was calculated by the method proposed by madras and sokal @xcite , is seen to increase rapidly with the increase in lattice size and possesses a sharp maximum at the transition temperature .",
    "the logarithm of the peak value of the energy auto - correlation time has been plotted against @xmath77 in fig.[tau4 ] .",
    "we find empirically a scaling rule , @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "[ data ]    the behavior of the order parameter correlation time @xmath93 is found to be similar in nature as that of @xmath86 .",
    "the energy histograms obtained for @xmath89 are shown in fig.[enghist4 ] .",
    "for this lattice , simulations were performed at @xmath83 temperatures ranging from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "this temperature range is rather small and were chosen to bracket the transition temperature .",
    "this diagram shows that there is an energy range where almost no sampling takes place for any temperature and there are dual peaked histograms at a number of temperatures where sampling takes place with one peak in the ordered phase and the other in the disordered phase .",
    "the existence of these dual peaked histograms is a signature of a first order phase transition where two phases can coexist at a given temperature .",
    "the error in estimating the reweighted probability @xmath96 from the raw histograms is given by @xmath97}^{1/2}}p_k\\left(q\\right)\\ ] ] and this can be estimated directly from the histogram counts .",
    "the percentage error in the reweighted probability for energy in the lattice @xmath98 is about @xmath99 where the raw histograms have peaks in the ordered phase . in the intermediate energy range where little sampling takes place for any choice of temperature",
    "the error is evidently large and this can not be significantly reduced by any realistic effort .",
    "fig.[eng4 ] shows the temperature variation of the energy for a number of lattices , as is obtained by applying histogram reweighting technique . from the energy histograms",
    ", we have calculated the free energy like quantity @xmath80 , defined as @xmath100 where @xmath65 is the histogram count of the energy distribution .",
    "the free energy barrier @xmath76 was evaluated and in fig.[fssfe4 ] we have plotted @xmath75 against @xmath77 where a good linear fit has been obtained .",
    "this is a direct verification of the scaling rule @xmath101 of lee and kosterlitz @xcite since the lattice dimensionality @xmath102 in this model .",
    "we further note that the scaling relation is well obeyed down to @xmath23 which happens to be of the order of the correlation length , @xmath78 for the system , as one can estimate from the relation @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the specific heat @xmath104 was obtained from the energy fluctuation and fig.[cv4 ] shows its temperature variation .",
    "it is evident that the peak height of @xmath104 grows rapidly at the transition . from fig.[fsscv4 ] , where the maxima of @xmath104 are plotted it is clear that the standard scaling rules @xmath105 for first order transition @xcite are accurately obeyed in this model .",
    "we have also tested the the finite size scaling relation @xmath106 which is valid for a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 represents the thermodynamic limit of the transition temperature @xmath108 .",
    "we have estimated the transition temperature in two ways  @xmath109 is the estimate of @xmath108 obtained from the peak position of the specific heat @xmath104 and @xmath110 represents the transition temperature obtained from the fine tuning of the free energy vs energy curve to obtain two equally deep minima . in fig.[fsstemp4 ]",
    "the transition temperatures thus obtained have been plotted against @xmath111 .",
    "it is seen that the linear fits are good within statistical errors and the thermodynamic limit of the transition temperature is @xmath112 , within which the two linear fits are seen to converge .",
    "the pair correlation functions @xmath113 and @xmath114 were calculated for temperatures @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath89 and are shown in fig.[angcor14 ] and and [ angcor24 ] .",
    "the first two of these temperatures are less than the transition temperature for this lattice while the other two temperatures are in the disordered phase .",
    "the curves have been fitted to a power law @xmath119 for @xmath120 and @xmath121 . it may be noted that the parameter @xmath122 is the asymptotic value of the pair correlation function .",
    "we observe that while the first rank correlation function @xmath113 decays to zero at the two higher temperatures ( @xmath123 ) , this is not the case for the higher rank correlation function @xmath114 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "in other words , while the lowest rank correlation among the spins vanishes just above transition , the next higher rank correlation continues to persist .",
    "the simulations in the two dimensional modified xy - model presented in this communication show that all the first order finite size scaling rules are obeyed .",
    "computation has been performed in system size up to @xmath125 which may be considered to be reasonably large for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion regarding the behavior of the model .",
    "we are inclined to conclude that the model exhibits a first order phase transition .",
    "this is in agreement with the views of some of the earlier investigators including domany @xmath0 @xcite and van enter and shlosman @xcite .",
    "the existence of a quasi - long - range - order - disorder transition observed in the 2-d xy - model is known to be due to vortex - antivortex unbinding ( kt transition ) . in absence of the role played by the vortices",
    ", one would not observe any order - disorder transition in the xy - model in accordance with the mermin - wagner theorem . in the class of models we have investigated the role played by the vortices changes qualitatively with change in @xmath4 ( which increases the non - linearity of the potential well ) as has been seen in the early work of himbergen @xcite .",
    "also we have seen that the number of vortex pairs grows rapidly with the increase in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , one may therefore think that the modified xy - model for large values of @xmath4 , behaves like a dense defect system and gives rise to a first order phase transition as has been predicted by minnahagen @xcite .    a similar change in the nature of phase transition has been observed to occur in a two - dimensional lebwohl - lasher model and a modified version of it @xcite .",
    "the potentials in these two models are @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively , the latter having a greater amount of non - linearity .",
    "although both models are in the same universality class , it was observed that while the @xmath126 potential leads to a continuous transition , the modified model with @xmath127 potential exhibits a strong first order phase transition .",
    "it has also been noticed that the suppression of the defects in these models leads to a total disappearance of the phase transitions @xcite .",
    "we mention another point before ending this section .",
    "this is the performance of wolff cluster algorithm which turned out to be very convenient to simulate the model .",
    "conventional algorithms , as we have seen , does not work well in this model .",
    "our earlier attempt @xcite using the recently developed wang - landau ( wl ) algorithm @xcite which directly determines the density of states of a system is also not a good choice for simulating this model .",
    "the main problem while using the wl algorithm is that configurations near the minimum energy take a very long time to be sampled during the random walk and it becomes impractical to simulate continuous models of even moderate size because of the huge cpu time that becomes necessary . among other things ,",
    "a great virtue of the wolff algorithm is that it does not contain any adjustable parameter even while simulating a continuous model .    besides using the wolff algorithm for the simulation we have used the ferrenberg - swendsen multiple histogram reweighting technique and the finite size scaling rules of lee and kosterlitz .",
    "we conclude by noting that a combination of these computational tools till now provides a very efficient and accurate method of analyzing results obtained in an unknown system .",
