    "when a liquid crystalline material is brought from the isotropic phase to the nematic phase , the turbidity ( i.e. , the total intensity of scattered light ) of the material increases by a factor of the order of @xmath6 , and the sample appears cloudy  @xcite . in samples in which the nematic ordering is well aligned , this intense scattering is due predominantly to thermal fluctuations in the orientation of the nematic director , and has been extensively studied and reported in the literature @xcite . if , on the other hand , the sample is not well aligned and contains a large number of topological defects ( disclinations , nematic hedgehogs , or surface defects ) , the turbidity becomes dominated by scattering from essentially static director inhomogeneities associated with these defects @xcite .",

    "our results are , in principle , applicable to any nematic system containing topological defects , but should be especially useful in interpreting detailed measurements of scattered - light intensity in highly disordered systems ( i.e. , those containing numerous defects ) .",
    "such configurations arise in low - molecular - weight nematics for example when the transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase is sudden ( e.g. , induced by a temperature quench ) @xcite , or when an originally well - aligned nematic sample is put in a sufficiently strong shear flow @xcite or under high alternating voltage @xcite . in polymer nematics ,",
    "numerous defects often persist even in the absence of any external agents @xcite , and significantly affect the mechanical @xcite and electro - optical @xcite properties of these materials .",

    "@xmath37 @xcite and described by the standard form of the gradient free energy  @xmath38 @xmath39 ( where summation over the indices i and j is implied ) , the contribution to the structure factor due to thermal fluctuations has the form @xmath40 with a temperature - dependent amplitude given by the microscopic length scale @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss power - law contributions to the structure factor that arise from topological defects .",
    "topologically stable defects occur in all @xmath13 vector model systems whenever @xmath42 .",
    "the order - parameter variations associated with the defects give rise to the porod - tail form of the structure factor , @xmath43 , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the thermal - fluctuation contribution , the power - law contributions to @xmath1 due to topological defects do not depend on temperature ( provided the defect structure is not affected by the temperature ) and occur in systems with discrete symmetries as well as in those with continuous symmetries .    in scalar systems ,",
    "this power - law behavior has long been understood as arising from abrupt changes in the order parameter across domain walls present in the system  @xcite .",
    "consider , for simplicity , a one - dimensional system in which the order parameter suffers a kink .",
    "viewed on length scales larger than the kink width ( which is given by the coherence length of the order parameter ) , the order parameter abruptly changes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 at the kink location .",
    "consequently , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defcr ] ) equals @xmath461 within the distance @xmath47 from the kink ( domain wall ) location and @xmath45 elsewhere in the system .",
    "this results in the normalized real - space correlation function of the form @xmath48 , reflecting the singular variation of the order parameter at the kink . the non - analytic part of @xmath49 , after fourier - transforming , yields a power - law form of the structure factor , @xmath50 , valid for values of @xmath0 larger than the inverse system size and smaller than the inverse kink width .",
    "for domain walls in dimensions @xmath18 higher then one , additional factors of @xmath51 arise due to the spatial extent of the domain walls , with the result ( averaged over domain - wall orientations ) @xmath52 . in regions between the domain walls",
    ", the order parameter does not vary , and therefore there are no extra contributions to the structure factor for @xmath0 values larger than the inverse domain size .",
    "we thus obtain a structure factor that has a power - law form for @xmath0 in the range between the inverse average domain wall separation and the inverse domain wall width , with the pre - factor proportional to the total domain wall area in the system .",
    "bray and humayun  @xcite investigated in detail how the singular variation of the order parameter around a point or line defect in a system with _ continuous _ symmetry will likewise lead to an asymptotic power - law dependence on @xmath0 of the structure factor @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they calculated exactly the exponent and the amplitude in the contribution @xmath53 to the structure factor coming from an isolated defect order - parameter configuration in the @xmath13 vector model .",
    "they also argued that for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the structure factor of a system containing a number of topological defects can be obtained by multiplying @xmath54 by the number density of defects .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "variations in the order parameter on very short scales [ probed by @xmath1 with @xmath0 large ] occur only in the singular regions surrounding the defect cores , which are separated by regions that barely contribute to @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to treat the contribution from each defect independently , and as coming from an isolated defect , _ provided that the configuration in the vicinity of the defect core is not affected by the presence of other defects_. while this assumption is known to be valid in some special cases [ such as the @xmath55 vector model ] , it is in general non - trivial .",
    "for example , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for the case of point defects in the @xmath56 vector model in @xmath57 , a highly asymmetrical , string - like configuration develops in between the defects .",
    "nevertheless , the prediction for @xmath1 based on the assumption of undeformed defect configurations has been found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations in several @xmath13 vector model phase - ordering systems  @xcite . in the calculations we present in secs .",
    "[ sec : onsymm][sec : biaxnemsys ] , we shall assume that the regions close to the defect cores in a phase ordering system _ do _ possess the structure of an isolated defect , and in sec .  [",
    "sec : corrtoporod ] we shall comment on the nature of possible corrections to our results .",
    "the discussion in the preceding paragraphs leads us to the following formulation of the _ generalized porod law _ for the orientation - averaged structure factor at zero temperature of a system containing topological defects : @xmath58 where @xmath3 is the _ defect density _",
    "( i.e. , the domain wall area , string length , or number of point defects , per unit volume of the system ) , and @xmath4 is a dimensionless amplitude characterizing the given type of defect .",

    "( [ genporod ] ) will be given throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "the value of the porod exponent @xmath10 can be anticipated on purely dimensional grounds . denoting by @xmath18 the spatial dimensionality of the system and by @xmath61 the dimensionality of the topological defect ( that is , @xmath62 for point defects , @xmath63 for string defects , and @xmath64 for domain walls )",
    ", we see that the defect density @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ genporod ] ) scales as @xmath65 , whereas the structure factor @xmath1 has the dimension of @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the exponent @xmath10 is given simply by @xmath67 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : corrtoporod ] for a more precise derivation of this result ) .",
    "in contrast , the dimensionless amplitude @xmath4 depends in more detail on the order parameter in question .",
    "for example , we shall see that the amplitudes @xmath4 for the nematic hedgehog and for the @xmath56 monopole in @xmath57 differ substantially .",
    "nematic liquid crystals represent an interesting case where several distinct power - law contributions to the structure factor can be present simultaneously in the same system .",
    "these contributions are discussed in detail in secs .",
    "[ sec : hedge][sec : thermal ] and are due to line defects ( disclinations ) , point defects ( nematic hedgehogs ) and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the competition among these terms can lead to a variety of forms of the tail of the structure factor appropriate to distinct physical conditions . before describing in detail the case of nematic liquid crystals ,",

    "the porod exponent @xmath10 and amplitude @xmath4 of a contribution to @xmath19 from a single defect in the configuration of an @xmath13 vector model was computed in ref .",

    "the proportionality of the porod tail to the defect density has been used previously @xcite to extract the power law characterizing the decay of disclination length ; extracting the absolute defect density in this way , however , would require the knowledge of the ( rarely experimentally available ) normalized structure factor . the location of the crossover @xmath265 , on the other hand , can be extracted from the unnormalized structure factor .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ringsinuni ] , we contrasted the contributions to the structure factor arising from twist - type and wedge - type disclination loops .",
    "the wedge - type loop of radius @xmath113 gives a @xmath278 contribution at @xmath206 in addition to the usual @xmath118 disclination contribution at @xmath411 , as it has the structure of a nematic hedgehog at large distances from the loop .",
    "likewise , any curved disclination segment of the wedge type gives rise to a @xmath278 contribution . in sec .",

    "such a behavior of the structure factor had been found to occur in experiments @xcite as well as in numerical simulations  @xcite , but not in approximate analytical theories @xcite .",
    "we concluded that it was , in principle , possible , but nevertheless unlikely , that the `` approach from above '' to the exponent @xmath412 observed in the experiments was due to @xmath278 contributions from hedgehog defects .",

    "( [ esk ] ) can be used as an indirect means of evaluating the orientation - averaged porod amplitude in the cases where the energy @xmath38 of the defect configuration is known .",
    "indeed , it was found in analytical investigations ( a.  d.  rutenberg , unpublished ) of the porod law corresponding to a point defect in the @xmath55 model in @xmath92 that the porod amplitude increased ( and the porod exponent @xmath419 remained unchanged ) when the symmetrical defect configuration was deformed .",
    "in general , the director rotates in any way such that two antipodal points in the nematic order - parameter space @xmath420 are connected upon encircling the disclination core , and the disclination is not necessarily of either the wedge type or the twist type .",
    "note that the porod - law regime with exponent @xmath208 is expected to be absent from the structure factor contribution arising from wedge - type satellite defect rings that have been predicted to occur under certain conditions around macroscopic particles suspended in a nematic liquid crystal [ see , e.g. , e.  m.  terentjev , phys .",
    "e * 51 * , 1330 ( 1995 ) ] . here , the effect of the wedge - type ring defect is to compensate for the radial boundary condition on the director at the surface of the particle , thus permitting a homogeneous director configuration at large distances from the particle ( without the need for other particles or defects ) ."
