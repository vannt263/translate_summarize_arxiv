    "structural properties  @xcite , such as degree distribution  @xcite , average distance  @xcite , degree correlations  @xcite , community  @xcite , motifs  @xcite , fractality  @xcite , and symmetry  @xcite , have received much attention in the field of complex networks , since these features play significant roles in characterizing and understanding complex networked systems in nature and society . among these important features , average distance characterizes the small - world behavior commonly observed in various disparate real networks  @xcite .",
    "it has been established that average distance is related to other structural properties , such as degree distribution  @xcite , fractality  @xcite and symmetry  @xcite . on the other hand , average distance has an important consequence on dynamical processes taking placing on networks , including disease spreading  @xcite , routing  @xcite , robustness  @xcite , percolation  @xcite , and so on . thus far , average distance has become a focus of attention for the scientific community  @xcite .    using above - mentioned structural properties , extensive empirical studies on diverse real systems",
    "have been done with an attempt to uncover and understand the generic features and complexity of these systems , and various network models have been proposed to reproduce or explaining the common characteristics of real - life networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , inspired by the well - known sierpinski gasket , we proposed a novel network , called sierpinski network  @xcite .",
    "the sierpinski network belongs to a deterministically growing class of networks that have attracted considerable attention and have turned out to be a useful tool  @xcite .",
    "many relevant topological properties of sierpinski network such as degree distribution , clustering coefficient , and strength distribution have been determined analytically  @xcite .",
    "also , the average distance of sierpinski network has been been investigated numerically , which was shown to behaves a logarithmic scaling with the number of network nodes ( vertices )  @xcite .    in view of the importance and usefulness of the quantity ",
    "average distance , here we derive a closed - form formula for the average distance characterizing the sierpinski network . the analytic method is on the basis of the recursive construction and self - similar structure of sierpinski network .",
    "our precise result shows that the average distance of sierpinski network increases logarithmically with the number of nodes .",
    "this scaling behaves differently from that of random networks  @xcite .",
    "our rigorous solution confirms the scaling between average distance and number of network nodes that was previously obtained numerically in  @xcite .     the first two stages in the construction for a variant of sierpinkski gasket.,width=453 ]",
    "the sierpinski network is derived from a variation of the sierpinski gasket  @xcite .",
    "the sierpinski gasket variant , shown in figure  [ sier ] , is constructed as follows  @xcite .",
    "we start with an equilateral triangle , and we denote this initial configuration by generation @xmath0 .",
    "then in the first generation @xmath1 , we divide the three sides of the equilateral triangle in three , then join these points and remove the three down pointing triangles . this forms",
    "six copies of the original triangle , and the procedure is repeated indefinitely for all the new copies . in the limit of infinite @xmath2 generations",
    ", we get a fractal variant of the sierpinski gasket .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the obtained fractal is @xmath3  @xcite . from the fractal",
    ", one can define the sierpinski network  @xcite , where vertices correspond to the removed triangles and two vertices are connected if the boundaries of the corresponding triangles contact each other .",
    "note that for uniformity , the three sides of the initial equilateral triangle at step 0 also correspond to three different vertices .",
    "figure  [ apollonian ] shows the network construction process .",
    "illustration of the network corresponding to the fractal shown in figure  [ sier].,width=302 ]    the sierpinski network can be generated using an iterative algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we denote the network after @xmath2 iterations by @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "then the network is constructed as follows : for @xmath0 , @xmath4 is a triangle .",
    "next , three nodes are added into the original triangle .",
    "these three new nodes are connected to each other forming a new triangle , and both ends of each edge of the new triangle are linked to a node of the original triangle .",
    "thus @xmath6 is obtained , see figure  [ iterative ] . for @xmath7",
    ", we can get @xmath4 from @xmath8 .",
    "for each of the existing triangles of @xmath8 that does not consist of three simultaneously emerging nodes and has never generated a node before , we define it an active triangle . we replace each of the active triangles in @xmath8 by the connected cluster on the right hand of figure  [ iterative ] to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting network presents the typical characteristics of real - life networks in nature and society  @xcite .",
    "it has power - law distributions of degree and strength , with exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "there also exists a power - law scaling relation between the strength @xmath11 and degree @xmath12 of an individual node , i.e. @xmath13 . on the other hand , for any individual vertex , its clustering coefficient is @xmath14 ; so when @xmath12 is large , @xmath15 is approximately inversely proportional to degree @xmath12 .",
    "the mean value @xmath16 of clustering coefficients of all vertices is very large , which asymptotically reaches a constant value 0.598 .",
    "moreover , the network is a maximal planar graph .",
    "after introducing the sierpinski network , we now derive analytically the average distance .",
    "we represent all the shortest path lengths of network @xmath17 as a matrix in which the entry @xmath18 is the distance between node @xmath19 and @xmath20 that is the length of a shortest path joining @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
