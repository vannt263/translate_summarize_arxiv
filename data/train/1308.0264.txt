    ", we find for the @xmath91-th central moment of the excitation number distribution @xmath96 each central moment is enhanced by a factor @xmath97 as compared to the respective central moment of the distribution of aggregate numbers @xmath94 .",
    "assuming the aggregates are excited independently ( which is justified considering the low excitation numbers at large detunings indicating the system is far from saturation ) @xmath92 is a poissonian distribution , which means that the second and third central moment equal the mean of the distribution . with the mean atom number @xmath98 we find @xmath99      the detection efficiency @xmath100 in our experiment affects the measured statistical distributions and it must be taken into account for a valid comparison with theory .",
    "we assume the detection process to be independent for each rydberg atom and also to not be influenced by the total number of rydberg atoms , which excludes saturation effects . in this case",
    "we can model the detector operation as a binomial process .",
    "the probability distribution of physically present rydberg atoms @xmath101 and the probability distribution of the detected rydberg atoms @xmath102 are related by @xmath103 where for all practical purposes the upper limit of the sum may be set to a finite value and the kernel @xmath104 of this transformation is given by @xmath105 assuming @xmath106 is known , equation now allows to relate the @xmath91-th order physical moments @xmath107 to the measured moments @xmath108 of their respective distributions .",
    "the results read @xmath109 and can be used to calculate the corresponding cumulants @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "subsequently the measured mandel-@xmath43-parameter , generalized to @xmath111-th order , @xmath112 can be related to the @xmath113 of the true distribution .",
    "evaluating the above for variance @xmath114 and third cumulant @xmath115 we get          to benchmark the re simulation , we compare its results with simulation results from a two - level wave function monte - carlo ( mcwf ) simulation .",
    "the mcwf simulation is essentially exact ( including the full many - body correlations ) , but can only be applied to smaller systems involving fewer excited atoms .",

    "the population in the zero - excitation state decreases exponentially until a significant part of the population is excited to higher @xmath9 values .",
    "furthermore , the depopulation of the zero - excitation state becomes slower with increasing detuning .",
    "fitting the exponential decay rates , we find that the obtained rates approximately scale with @xmath130 , in particular for higher detunings .",

    "the reason for this is that only the first excitation is off - resonant , while subsequently the aggregate size equilibrates rapidly by resonant excitation of atoms with well defined interaction energy .",
    "the slow timescale for the formation of the initial seed excitation and rapid subsequent growth leads to enhanced excitation number fluctuations , and thus an increased value for the mandel @xmath43 parameter .",
    "the timescale for the sequential formation of an aggregate is the sum of the timescales of the individual excitation steps .",
    "therefore it is dominated by the slowest process , which is the off - resonant excitation of the initial grain .",

    "the rate for an overall resonant simultaneous @xmath4-photon excitation can be obtained by adiabatically eliminating the intermediate states , i.e. the states containing between 1 and m-1 excitations .",
    "for a two - photon excitation , e.g. , the rate is given by @xmath137 with @xmath138 being the detuning from the intermediate state ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for m - photon excitation the formula can be generalized to @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the detuning from the intermediate state containing @xmath71 excitations .",
    "the adiabatic elimination is valid as long as all intermediate detunings @xmath140 are smaller than both the dephasing rate and the respective multi - photon rabi frequency . for our experimental parameters",
    "these criteria are fulfilled for aggregates of size up to @xmath141 assuming approximately equidistant spacing between the atoms .",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg atoms with their extreme properties and long - range interactions are an ideal system to study strongly - correlated regimes , especially since the laser excitation itself in combination with strong interactions naturally produces spatial and temporal correlations  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , aside from this very specific preparation scheme , the precise nature of the excitation process is not yet well understood , especially in the presence of dephasing or decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is whether many - body states are created simultaneously in a coherent multi - photon process or arise due to sequential excitations of individual atoms around an initial grain . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , we interpret _ enhanced _ number fluctuations which we observe for detuned excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a simplified picture to explain the effect of correlations on the fcs . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the enhanced fluctuations to the excitation of rydberg aggregates comprised of several atoms at well defined distances . to identify the dominant formation mechanisms we compare the rates for direct multi - photon excitation and sequential excitation </S>",
    "<S> in which an initial grain is excited slowly , followed by much faster resonant excitation at preferred distances . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusions are supported by many - body simulations which include the relevant experimental parameters .    in order to get an intuitive understanding of the excitation process we start with a simple picture for how the statistical distribution of rydberg atoms is influenced by the laser coupling , in particular as a function of detuning . </S>",
    "<S> we consider rydberg atoms in a one - dimensional geometry with repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig1]a shows a sketch of the bare energies of the many - body states in the rotating frame . </S>",
    "<S> each energy level decreases linearly with detuning @xmath0 , with the slope proportional to the number of excitations @xmath4 and the offset equal to the total interaction energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed rectangle represents the states that can be excited for a given detuning .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonance condition for direct multi - photon excitation is @xmath5 , however , aggregates can also form by an off - resonant excitation at the energy of the @xmath6 state ( @xmath7 ) followed by additional resonant excitations . for positive detunings , configurations with positive interaction energy are energetically favored  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence we expect an enhancement of rydberg excitations for @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> . independent creation of aggregates is expected in the long - time limit of the fully coherent system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finite duration of the excitation does not evolve the system into the global steady state , which together with the laser dephasing promotes the formation of different aggregate sizes in different parts of the excitation volume . </S>",
    "<S> this bunching of excitations will have a dramatic effect on higher order moments of the statistical distribution . </S>",
    "<S> assuming independent excitation of nearly equally sized aggregates ( same @xmath4 ) , the variance of the rydberg number @xmath9 scales as @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> higher order moments of the distribution also scale with simple powers of @xmath4 ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> the experiments are carried out as follows . </S>",

    "<S> . the imaged radial cloud size of 3.5@xmath17 m is limited by optical resolution , therefore we adjust this parameter in comparison with theory . </S>",

    "<S> the maximal peak density of ground state atoms is @xmath18@xmath19 , corresponding to a mean inter - particle spacing at the trap center of @xmath200.9@xmath17 m . </S>",
    "<S> lower densities are achieved by reducing the time taken for initial loading of the dipole trap .    </S>",
    "<S> rydberg atoms in the state @xmath21 are excited by applying a two - photon laser pulse for @xmath22s ( after turning off the optical trap ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lasers are close to two - photon resonance , detuned @xmath2365mhz below the intermediate @xmath24 state . </S>",
    "<S> the first laser at @xmath25 nm uniformly illuminates the cloud , while the second excitation laser at @xmath26  nm is focused to an elliptical region of size @xmath27 ( vertical @xmath16 horizontal gaussian beam waists ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two excitation laser beams counter - propagate and cross the atomic cloud perpendicular to its long axis </S>",
    "<S> . the effective ( single - atom ) two - photon rabi frequency is @xmath28mhz ( peak value ) and the linewidth related dephasing between ground and rydberg state is @xmath29mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the two - photon detuning @xmath0 can be varied by scanning the second step laser frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the rydberg atoms interact repulsively with van der waals coefficient @xmath30ghz@xmath17m@xmath31@xcite . in the low density limit </S>",
    "<S> this gives a blockade radius of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> at a density of @xmath33@xmath19 however we expect @xmath34 atoms per blockade sphere . as a result </S>",

    "<S> we observe a clearly asymmetric dependence of @xmath43 on the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast to recent observations involving rydberg @xmath53 states featuring attractive as well as repulsive interactions , where large fluctuations were observed either side of the resonance  @xcite . for negative detunings we measure @xmath54 which reflects poissonian fluctuations in the limit of weak excitation . around resonance </S>",

    "<S> the different peak amplitudes between the inset and main figure are due to the different simulation volumes and finite size effects.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to address the question of how the aggregates form we estimate the dominant formation rates in the limit of large laser detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the overall rate for sequential excitation is limited by the off - resonant excitation rate of the first atom , @xmath68 , since subsequent excitation steps are resonant for the preferred distance @xmath69 . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> if the total interaction energy for a state involving @xmath4 excitations is precisely matched by the laser detuning , then simultaneous @xmath4-photon excitation can occur with a rate @xmath70 , obtained by adiabatically eliminating all intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> the detunings from the intermediate states involving @xmath71 excitations ( assumed to be equidistantly spaced along a line ) are @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of sequential to simultaneous rates for @xmath4-atom aggregates therefore scales as @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for the availability of atoms at specific distances leads to a slight modification of these rates , nonetheless , for @xmath74 the ratio still increases exponentially with aggregate size @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> for our experimental parameters the rate for simultaneous @xmath75-photon excitation is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than sequential growth . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath76 simultaneous excitation is suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath77 at @xmath0=20mhz .    to further elucidate whether sequential excitation is the dominant formation mechanism in our experiments we perform time - dependent numerical simulations using an effective two - level rate equation ( re ) model ( @xcite , based on  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the re approach can model our precise experimental geometry , but approximates many - body correlations via an energy shift depending on the state of the surrounding atoms . </S>",
    "<S> thus it does not capture multi - atom coherences which would be present in a simultaneous multi - photon excitation . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we find that the results of the re model qualitatively reproduce the full statistical distributions including higher order moments for @xmath55 where the aggregates are formed ( solid lines in figs . 1b , 2 and 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a small discrepancy between theory and data on the red side of the resonance ( @xmath58 ) and a slight shoulder in the mean number around @xmath7810mhz which can not be explained by the re model . </S>",
    "<S> this shoulder possibly indicates the presence of additional physical processes like atomic motion due to repulsive forces which would be more pronounced on the blue side of the resonance because of the excitation of rydberg atoms with small separations . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , given the good agreement , especially for the mandel q parameter in the regime @xmath55 , we conclude that coherent multi - photon excitation is not required to explain our experimental findings , since such processes are not included in the re treatment . </S>",
    "<S> instead , for our parameters the dominant mechanism by which aggregates are formed at large detuning is via sequential ( single - atom ) excitations around an initial grain . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by time - dependent simulations which show that the off - resonant excitation of the initial grain is slow while the subsequent resonant excitation of additional atoms happens on faster time scales , as we show in the supplemental material  @xcite .    to further substantiate that sequential excitation dominates over direct multi - photon excitation we benchmark the re model with two - level wave function monte - carlo ( mcwf ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the mcwf method includes multi - atom coherences , but can only be applied to systems involving fewer excited atoms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we simulate 50 atoms in a spherical volume with radius @xmath79 m and the other parameters being comparable to those of the experiments . the close agreement of the two simulations ( see fig.1 in the supplemental material  @xcite ) , together with the good agreement between re model and experimental data is a strong indication for the sequential excitation indeed being the dominant process in our system .    considering the good agreement between theory and experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we can extract more information about the underlying many - body correlations from the results of the re model . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we extract the second order spatial correlation function @xmath80 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig4 ] ) , as defined in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath81mhz we observe strong liquid - like correlations ( i.e. a strong first peak in @xmath80 followed by peaks with decaying amplitudes ) which are responsible for the large measured @xmath43 values . </S>",
    "<S> the pronounced peak at @xmath82 m reflects a strongly preferred pair distance . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller peak at @xmath83 is evidence for higher order correlations for @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are strongly reduced for near resonant excitation ( @xmath85 mhz ) . for resonant driving the peaks </S>",
    "<S> are even smaller , but still non - trivial correlations are present , as recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these spatial correlations could be exploited in other areas of physics such as in the creation of strongly - coupled plasmas  @xcite . comparing to the @xmath80 as obtained from mcwf simulations ( 100 atoms in a cylindrical volume with radius @xmath86 m and length @xmath87 m ) we find again close agreement ( fig .  [ fig : fig4 ] inset ) , apart from a small additional peak at @xmath88 m , which indicates a minor contribution from direct excitation of rydberg atom pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this peak depends sensitively on the laser dephasing which quickly destroys multi - atom coherences .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have investigated laser excited rydberg aggregates in a quasi-1d geometry . using full counting statistics we determine their typical size as @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> our work emphasizes sequential excitation as the dominant mechanism under conditions of large dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights the need to account for dephasing and dissipation in theoretical descriptions of strongly correlated rydberg gases . </S>",
    "<S> so far , most theoretical work has focused on lattice geometries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an open question whether results qualitatively different from ours are obtained for off - resonant excitation in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> however , even for lower dephasing rates , the vanishing multi - photon rabi frequencies for large @xmath4 suggests that sequential growth of aggregates is likely to play a significant role in existing experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing sequential and simultaneous excitation using fcs is intrinsically challenging , since both processes lead to very similar results . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in order to experimentally distinguish coherent multi - photon excitation vs. sequential growth , future experiments could e.g. measure the double peak structure in the spatial correlation function @xmath90 as shown in fig.4 ( inset ) .    </S>",
