    "very broad iron k@xmath0 lines are seen in the x - ray spectra of some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , indicating that the x - ray illuminated disk extends deep into the gravitational potential well of the black hole .",
    "the broadest lines , indicating the most extreme velocities and strongest gravitational fields , are seen in narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies such as 1h0707 - 495 and iras13224 - 3809 .",
    "spectral fitting with a power law and its reflection over the 2 - 10 kev range requires that the black hole has high spin , so that the innermost stable orbit of the material in the disk is below 2rg , and that the line emissivity is strongly centrally peaked onto this inner disk edge , and that the spectrum is dominated by the reflected emission rather than the intrinsic continuum .",
    "these properties were first seen in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite but are much more extreme in 1h0707 - 495 @xcite and iras13224 - 3809 @xcite . this behavior can be produced from the light - bending model @xcite , where a small lamppost source moves in the vicinity of the black hole changing its distance from the center .",
    "strong relativistic effects can simultaneously boost the continuum as seen by the very inner edge of the disk , and reduce its outwards flux towards the observer when the source is very close to the event horizon of a high spin black hole .",
    "this results in a more or less constant reflection intensity , but with increasing smearing from the increasingly centrally concentrated illumination , while the observed primary power law emission drops @xcite .",
    "this lamp - post geometry gives a successful framework in which to interpret the spectra and spectral variability seen in these extreme nls1 @xcite .",
    "however , most modeling to date has assumed a toy model of an infinitesimal ( point ) source .",
    "this is the simplest case for general relativistic ray tracing calculations , and @xcite shows that a more physical vertically extended region can be well approximated by a point source at some effective intermediate height .",
    "here we try to set a lower limit on the size of an x - ray source on the spin axis from assuming that its emission is from compton scattering of seed photons from the disk .",
    "compton scattering conserves photon number so the corona must intercept at least as many seed photons as are required to form the observed reflected emission .",
    "we include both direct disk emission and the flux from re - processing of the illuminating source , and self consistently calculate the resulting photon density on the black hole spin axis including full general relativistic effects .",
    "we estimate this minimum radius for a spherical source , and find that it is compact but not tiny for an intrinsic @xmath1 , as is typically observed in nls1 .",
    "this source can only fit within the space if its height above the horizon is larger than its radius ( boyer lindquist coordinates ) which limits the height to @xmath2 for an on - axis source for the steepest observed spectra ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , tailoring the model to the mean spectrum of the most extreme nls1 , 1h0707 - 495 , reveals a much stronger inconsistency .",
    "the centrally concentrated emissivity ( radial index of @xmath4 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observed high reflected fraction ( @xmath5 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with a source at @xmath6 . however , at this low height the observed @xmath7 is dramatically reduced from the intrinsic one , so the intrinsic source @xmath8 .",
    "this requires a source size which is much larger than for @xmath9 , so this can not fit within @xmath10 for any spectral index .",
    "some other geometry is instead required .",
    "we note that a corona which extends radially over this disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will see many more photons than an on axis source .",
    "either the extent of the relativistic effects are overestimated from the spectra ( e.g. the steepness of the radial emissivity profiles could be biased to higher values by the assumption of a constant ionization reflected spectrum @xcite or by the effects of complex absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , or relativistic effects alone do not control both the spectrum and variability of the source e.g the deep dips can not be caused by light - bending in the radially extended corona model of @xcite .",
    "nls1 are typically lower mass , higher mass accretion rate agn than standard broad line seyfert 1s .",
    "we show all calculations for mass of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with maximal spin , @xmath13 .",
    "we assume an inclination angle of @xmath14 to the spin axis but this makes little difference to the results .",
    "all size scales @xmath15 ( radii on the disk , height of the corona , radial size of the corona ) are given in units of the gravitational radius , so @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we first show results in a newtonian framework , where we assume that there is no change in photon energy or rate between the disk and the lamp - post , or between these and the observer at infinity .",
    "we also assume that light travels in straight lines , but we use the full novikov - thorne emissivity for ease of comparison with the fully relativistic approach in the next section .",
    "this gives the surface temperature @xmath19 in the comoving disk frame , which peaks at @xmath20 at @xmath21 for @xmath13 .",
    "this inner disk temperature is high enough to produce substantial emission in the observable soft x - ray regime , especially if electron scattering within the disk acts as expected , giving a color temperature correction @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath23 in all results shown .",
    "the key determinant of the source size is the ratio of photons required for comptonization compared to the photons available , which in turn is set by @xmath24 .",
    "observations show that this is generally small in nls1s , at around @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for ease of comparison to the full relativistic calculation in the next section we here include the effect of redshift from the source to the observer . for a source at height @xmath26 then an observed @xmath27 corresponds to a luminosity in the lamp - post frame of @xmath28 .",
    "following the light bending model , we assume that this is constant as a function of source height .",
    "the coronal emission is soft , with power law photon index @xmath29 @xcite between a low energy cutoff set by the seed photon temperature and a high energy cutoff set by the electron temperature which we fix at 100  kev in the lamppost frame . for a steep spectrum ,",
    "the number of photons is critically dependent on the low energy cutoff , which is at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the temperature of the seed photons in the lamp - post frame assuming they have a blackbody distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence we use the full compton continuum shape as approximated by the nthcomp @xcite model in xspec to relate the energy flux in the spectrum to photon number for a given seed photon temperature .",
    "the photon rate required to make the comptonized spectrum depends also on the optical depth @xmath32 of the corona , as only a factor @xmath33 of the photons are scattered into the tail .",
    "this depends on geometry as well as spectral index and electron temperature , and requires a fully relativistic treatment ( rather than analytic approximations ) for electron temperatures which are a substantial fraction of the electron rest mass as assumed here .",
    "hence we use the xspec model compps @xcite which includes all these factors .",
    "we choose a a spherical geometry with isotropic seed photons ( geom=-4 ) , where spectral indices of @xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond to @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38  kev .",
    "we use @xmath39  kev @xcite , but the derived values for @xmath32 do not depend much on this parameter . hence the required seed photon rate , @xmath40 , needs to be larger than the rate of photons in the compton spectrum , @xmath41 , by the factor @xmath42 , so @xmath43 .",
    "these x - ray photons illuminate the disk , so can be either reflected or reprocessed ( thermalized ) in the disk .",
    "the fraction which thermalize , @xmath44 can add to the seed photon flux from the intrinsic disk emission .",
    "photons from the lamp - post emitted into a solid angle @xmath45 illuminate a surface area perpendicular to the light rays at the disk of @xmath46 at radius @xmath47 ( see geometry in * ? ? ?",
    "this corresponds to a surface area on the disk @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then the illuminating flux on the disk is @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to a rise in temperature such that @xmath52 . however , this increase is negligible where the ratio @xmath24 is small .",
    "this is a somewhat surprising result in the context of the x - ray spectrum , where the lamp - post model generates an extremely centrally concentrated emissivity .",
    "however , even in a fully relativistic treatment , this concentrated illumination is small compared to the much more luminous disk emission .",
    "the source at the height @xmath53 on the disk axis with a cross - section @xmath54 receives photons from the disk area @xmath55 into the solid angle @xmath56 .",
    "thus the fraction of photons from the disk which illuminate the source , @xmath57 , increases with decreasing @xmath47 down to @xmath58 where it reaches a maximum and then decreases with the further decrease of @xmath47 .",
    "the rate at which photons are emitted from the disk at radius @xmath47 depends on the temperature , @xmath59 , and the total rate of the intercepted photons by the source is @xmath60 assuming that the source emits isotropically . the total seed photon rate @xmath61 , giving the radius of the corona , @xmath62 , from the constraint that @xmath40 needs to be such that it can make the comptonized emission .",
    "the seed photons have a range in temperature as they are produced over a range of radii .",
    "however , this multi temperature seed photon distribution has a clear peak at energy @xmath63 , and can be fairly well approximated by a single blackbody at a temperature @xmath64 .",
    "this seed photon temperature is always somewhat smaller than the peak disk temperature , @xmath20 , by an amount that depends slightly on the source height . for @xmath65",
    "this reaches a maximum of @xmath66 , while for @xmath67 it asymptotes to @xmath68 .",
    "the black , green and blue lines in figure  [ fig : newton ] show the derived source size as a function of height for @xmath69 and @xmath35 for a black hole mass of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath23 with @xmath72 . the seed photon density on axis increases with decreasing @xmath73 until @xmath74 for our assumed @xmath71 ,",
    "so the source size decreases up to this point , then tends to a constant value of a few @xmath75 as the flux no longer rises due to the inner hole to the disk .",
    "we repeated the calculation for @xmath76 , and for a color temperature correction of both @xmath77 as well as @xmath78 , but these parameters make a negligible difference to the results .",
    "our results are also fairly insensitive to our assumption that @xmath72 , as it is @xmath24 which is important . with this set to @xmath79",
    "then @xmath80 is the main determinant of source size .",
    "steeper spectra require more photons to make the same luminosity , and also intercept a smaller fraction of the available seed photons due to their lower optical depth .",
    "both factors increase the seed photons required by around a factor three @xmath3 compared to @xmath81 , so the source size is a factor @xmath82 larger for @xmath3 than @xmath81 .",
    "thus the source size changes from @xmath83 as @xmath80 increases from @xmath84 .",
    "the source is compact , as seems reasonable in view of the fast variability and micro - lensing constraints , but not tiny , as also seems reasonable in view of the energy emitted from the region .",
    "there are clearly a number of relativistic factors which affect this calculation .",
    "we illustrate the effect of each of these in turn in figure  [ fig : releff ] , where the dotted black line shows the @xmath81 results from figure  [ fig : newton ] .",
    "firstly the energy of the seed photons from each annulus in the disk as seen in the lamp - post frame is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the energy shift between the comoving disk frame and the lamp - post . for @xmath87",
    "then this is a redshift , while for @xmath88 it is a blueshift .",
    "the photon rate received at the lamp - post depends on @xmath89 , so the required source size increases for @xmath87 , and decreases for @xmath88 ( red line : figure  [ fig : releff ] ) . note , that @xmath90 in relativistic case is shifted to higher values , since the maximum temperature as perceived by the corona is @xmath91 $ ] instead of just @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "another factor is that the curvature of space - time means that a source of given proper size extends over a smaller radial coordinate distance as the source approaches the black hole .",
    "the radial coordinate distance is important as this sets the position of the horizon , @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 ( boyer lindquist coordinates ) .",
    "this effect means that the source radius in boyer - lindquist coordinates is always smaller than from the non - relativistic approach ( blue line : figure  [ fig : releff ] ) .",
    "the green line in figure  [ fig : releff ] shows the effect of light bending and aberration on the solid angles .",
    "we use the code of @xcite to follow the full photon geodesics , and transform the angles discussed above .",
    "however , this is not such an important effect . the solid black line in figure  [ fig : releff ] including all relativistic effects",
    "is dominated by the boosting / de - boosting of the thermal emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : e0 ] shows resulting fully relativistic mean energy of seed photons and comptonized photons in the lamp - post frame . the red solid line shows the seed photon temperature @xmath64 , where @xmath63 is the peak energy of the multicolor black body received at the lamp - post .",
    "the green solid line shows the mean seed photon energy , @xmath95 from this multicolor blackbody .",
    "the fact that it is close to @xmath96 shows that a single blackbody is a good approximation to the shape of the seed photon distribution .",
    "the blue solid line shows the mean energy of photons in the comptonized spectrum for the fiducial model with @xmath81 shown in figure  [ fig : releff ] .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : e0 ] show the corresponding newtonian energies .",
    "the change in energy is much larger in the fully relativistic treatment due to the boosting / de - boosting of photons between the co - moving disk frame and the lamp - post .",
    "thus its impact on the number of photons required in the compton spectrum is larger than in the newtonian case .",
    "however , the power extracted from the electrons @xmath97 so it does not depend much on height as @xmath98 is set by @xmath99 , and both change together for a given spectral index ( see figure  [ fig : e0 ] ) , so this is canceled out by the opposite change in @xmath41 .",
    "thus our model is consistent with the constant dissipation in the intrinsic x - ray source which is assumed in the lamp - post geometry .",
    "it comes out that about @xmath100 , and @xmath101 of the intrinsic primary x - ray luminosity needs to be extracted from electrons for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : radius ] shows the resulting minimum radial size estimate of the corona in full general relativity , again for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as before , softer spectra ( @xmath81 : blue ; @xmath104 : green ; @xmath35 red ) require a larger source size .",
    "the black line shows the maximum size , set by the constraint that the corona does not extend below the horizon . a source with @xmath81 and @xmath104 can have @xmath105 at any height for an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath106",
    "however , there are not enough photons on the spin axis of the black hole to make the softest spectra observed in nls1 for a source of this luminosity at a height @xmath107 .",
    "1h0707 - 495 is one of the most extreme nls1 in terms of the inferred relativistic effects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter z10 ) .",
    "the 0.3 - 10  kev power law flux in these data from 2008 changes from @xmath108 to @xmath109  erg  @xmath110  s@xmath111 ( z10 ) , and the lowest flux episode is similar to the spectrum seen in 2011 where the inferred line emissivity has index of @xmath112 , requiring a source at @xmath113 ( @xcite , hereafter f12 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence we use @xmath114 as the baseline for the lowest flux observation in 2008 .",
    "the power law flux at each frequency is suppressed by the factor @xmath115 where @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the light - bending term . at such a low height , @xmath118 ( corresponding to redshift @xmath119 ) , while @xmath120 .",
    "figure  [ fig : e0 ] shows that the seed photon temperature @xmath121  kev in the lamp - post frame , so we redshift a compton spectrum with @xmath3 and this seed photon temperature to find the bolometric correction from the observed 0.3 - 10  kev bandpass is a factor of 2.32 , so @xmath122  erg  @xmath110  s@xmath111 , or @xmath123 . since this is suppressed by the factor @xmath124 , the intrinsic source flux in the lamp - post frame is @xmath125  erg  @xmath110  s@xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath126 .",
    "this is substantially larger than the flux assumed in section 3 , so all radii in figure  [ fig : radius ] will be increased by a factor @xmath127 .",
    "these source sizes can not fit within @xmath26 , let alone @xmath114 for any @xmath29 .",
    "we show the resulting source radius on a linear scale as the red solid line in figure  [ fig:1h0707 ] .",
    "it is always larger than the maximum source size which can fit above the horizon ( black solid line ) .",
    "by contrast , the red dotted line shows the source size which gives the observed @xmath128 .",
    "the minimum source height which is consistent with the source fitting above the horizon is @xmath129 .",
    "however , at this height , relativistic effects are not so extreme and the emissivity radial power - law index is @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the maximum x - ray flux from the source is a factor @xmath131 larger , implying @xmath132 ( including the bolometric correction ) .",
    "this flux change can be produced by moving the source up to @xmath133 ( see figure  [ fig : flux ] ) , but the dark green dotted line in figure  [ fig:1h0707 ] shows that a source of this observed luminosity can not fit anywhere on the spin axis for @xmath134 .",
    "however , the lowest luminosity power law has large uncertainties ( e.g. z10 , f12 ) .",
    "instead , we recalculate our results from the mean spectrum from 2008 , where the power law detection is much more robust with a 0.3 - 10  kev flux of @xmath135  erg  @xmath110  s@xmath111 ( f12 ) .",
    "this has an emissivity index of 6.6 , which still requires a very small lamp - post height of @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "we use the largest source height of @xmath137 , but this is probably an overestimate as seen by the large reflected fraction of the data .",
    "z10 quote a ratio of reflected to power law flux of 1.3 in their 0.3 - 10  kev bandpass , but this requires a solid angle of @xmath138 for their low ionization parameter .",
    "the predicted solid angle for a lamp - post source at @xmath137 is @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "thus the observed reflection dominance and centrally concentrated emissivity are consistent with the lamppost at @xmath140 .",
    "this gives @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , and a bolometric correction of @xmath143 , hence a flux as seen at infinity of @xmath144  erg  @xmath110  s@xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath145 .",
    "this is suppressed by a factor @xmath146 ( figure  [ fig : flux ] ) , so the intrinsic luminosity in the lamp - post frame is @xmath147 .",
    "this implies an even larger source size than before , with @xmath148 as shown by the blue solid line in figure  [ fig:1h0707 ] .",
    "even the observed @xmath149 is too large a luminosity to be produced by a source on the spin axis for any @xmath150 ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "the large intrinsic x - ray luminosities required in order to produce the observed reflected emission dramatically exceed those observed due to the strong suppression of the x - ray flux from the combined effects of redshift and light bending .",
    "such large intrinsic luminosities require a correspondingly large source size in order to intercept sufficient seed photons .",
    "this size is inconsistent with the size scale required for the source to fit above the horizon .",
    "the largest intrinsic luminosity which is consistent with the minimum source size which can fit above the horizon at small @xmath73 is shown by the solid green line in figure  [ fig:1h0707 ] , which has @xmath151 .",
    "this is a factor of 10 smaller than the _ observed _ 0.3 - 10  kev flux at maximum , so this can not possibly be a viable solution .",
    "the corona would have to change its size with height by much larger amount to increase the intrinsic primary flux to reach these observed values and then it will no longer fit above the horizon ( the green solid line in figure  [ fig:1h0707 ] would have to curve up to join the dark - green dotted line ) .",
    "there is no viable lamp - post source geometry ( small source on the black hole spin axis ) which can explain the observations of 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "the mismatch is most marked by considering the mean spectrum from 2008 ( z10 ; f12 ) , where the intrinsic power law is clearly seen along with highly relativistically smeared reflection . a source which is at small enough height to explain the observed highly centrally peaked emissivity and reflection dominance has @xmath152 .",
    "however , the power law suppression from both light bending and redshift here is extreme , and requires that the observed rather small x - ray luminosity must instead represent a much larger intrinsic x - ray luminosity , of @xmath153 ! this requires a minimum source size of @xmath154 assuming that the power law is formed by compton up - scattering of seed photons from the disk , so it can not have an effective mean height of @xmath137 , so it can not reproduce the implied large reflected fraction , nor the extremely centrally peaked emissivity .",
    "a small source at @xmath137 could be recovered if there is an additional source of seed photons , perhaps from a strong magnetic field .",
    "a magnetic field is surely required in order to produce the lamppost source in the first place , so it is worth exploring this possibility . to have the magnetic energy density",
    "be of the order of the x - ray energy density for @xmath155 requires @xmath156  g , but self - absorption will strongly limit the number of cyclo - synchrotron seed photons which can be produced @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the source could easily power both the large x - ray luminosity and sustain a large magnetic field as the optical / uv emission from the outer disk in 1h0707 - 495 implies that the source is accreting at @xmath157 for a maximally rotating black hole with mass of @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "thus it is energetically possible that the very weak observed x - rays are due to a very high intrinsic x - ray flux which is dissipated so close to the black hole that it is strongly suppressed .",
    "however , @xmath159 is a completely new requirement for nls1 .",
    "generically these are observed to be x - ray weak even in sources where the spectra are not dominated by reflection , and the observed reflection is not strongly smeared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a tiny lamp - post corona geometry can not explain all the aspects of the x - ray data : the source must be somewhat extended .",
    "this highlights an issue with our calculations as our model simply scales the seed photon density on the spin axis to set the source size , without explicitly re - calculating the seed photon density for the off - axis extent of the source and for the expected rotation of such a source .",
    "this is clearly required , and means that the source will intercept more seed photons from the disk as the black hole spin axis minimizes the photon density .",
    "thus a full 3d computation is required to estimate the actual size and shape of the corona .",
    "calculations of extended source geometries have been done by e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , it seems highly unlikely that the reflecting disk can remain thin and flat for such a super eddington flow , so the reflector geometry as well as the coronal size and shape should also be considered .",

    "this would lead to @xmath192 smaller radii in the first case and @xmath193 larger radii in the second case for the spin @xmath71 and height @xmath114 .",
    "thus our estimation of corona radius from proper area will not differ too much from the radius that would be given in the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "we assume the local x - ray emission of the corona to be given by the non - thermal comptonization model , nthcomp @xcite , available in the spectral fitting package xspec @xcite .",
    "we compute the nthcomp normalization , @xmath194 , from the observed photon flux @xmath195 here we needed to use the computation of nthcomp luminosity in the corona frame since it depends on the temperature of the incident black - body radiation .",
    "then the total observed luminosity , @xmath7 , and the total intrinsic photon production rate in the corona , @xmath196 , are @xmath197 and @xmath198 respectively .",

    "<S> the lamppost model is often used to describe the x - ray source geometry in agn , where an infinitesimal point source is located on the black hole spin axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially invoked for narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies , where an extremely broad iron line seen in episodes of low x - ray flux can both be explained by extremely strong relativistic effects as the source approaches the black hole horizon.the most extreme spectrum seen from the nls1 1h0707 - 495 requires that the source is less than 1rg above the event horizon in this geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , the source must also be large enough to intercept sufficient seed photons from the disk to make the hard x - ray compton continuum which produces the observed iron line / reflected spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we use a fully relativistic ray tracing code to show that this implies that the source must be substantially larger than 1rg in 1h0707 - 495 if the disk is the source of seed photons . </S>",
    "<S> hence the source can not fit as close as 1rg to the horizon , so the observed spectrum and variability are not formed purely by effects of strong gravity but probably also by changes in corona and inner accretion flow geometry .    </S>",
