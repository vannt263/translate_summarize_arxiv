    "is the so called locally - periodic microstructures , where spatial changes of the microstructure are observed on a scale smaller than the size of the considered domain but larger than the characteristic size of the microstructure .",
    "the distribution of microstructures in locally - periodic materials is known a priori , in contrast to the stochastic description of the medium considered in stochastic homogenization , @xcite .",
    "there are few mathematical results on homogenization in locally - periodic and fibrous media .",
    "the homogenization of a heat - conductivity problem defined in locally - periodic and non - periodic domains consisting of spherical balls was studied in @xcite using the murat - tartar @xmath1convergence method , defined in @xcite .",
    "the locally - periodic and non - periodic distribution of balls is given by a @xmath2diffeomorphism @xmath3 , transforming the centres of the balls .",
    "for the derivation of macroscopic equations for the problem posed in the non - periodic domain , where the changes of the microstructure are given on the scale of the considered microstructure , a locally - periodic approximation was considered .",
    "estimates for the numerical approximation of this problem were derived in @xcite . the notion of @xmath4 convergence , motivated by the homogenization in a domain with a microstructure of",
    "non - periodically distributed spherical balls , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the young measure was used in @xcite to extend the concept of periodic two - scale convergence , presented in @xcite , and to define the so - called _",
    "scale convergence_. the definition of scale convergence was mainly motivated by the derivation of the @xmath5-limit for a sequence of nonlinear energy functionals involving non - periodic oscillations .",
    "it has been shown that the two - scale and multi - scale convergences are particular cases of the scale convergence . in @xcite , as an example of non - periodic oscillations , the domain with perforations given by the transformation of centre of balls was considered .",
    "macroscopic models for non - periodic fibrous materials were presented in @xcite and derived in @xcite .",
    "the non - periodic fibrous material is characterised by gradually rotated planes of parallel aligned fibres . by applying the @xmath1convergence method for a locally periodic approximation of the non - periodic microstructure",
    "the effective homogenized matrix was derived .",
    "the asymptotic expansion method was used in @xcite to derive macroscopic equations for a filtration problem through a locally - periodic fibrous medium .",
    "a formal asymptotic expansion was also applied to derive a macroscopic model for a poisson equation , @xcite , and for convection - diffusion equations , @xcite , defined in domains with locally - periodic perforations , i.e. domains consisting of periodic cells with smoothly changing perforations .",
    "two - scale convergence , defined for periodic test functions , was applied in @xcite to homogenize warping , torsion and neumann problems in a two - dimensional domain with a smoothly changing perforation .",
    "optimization of the corresponding homogenized problems was considered in @xcite .",
    "locally - periodic perforation is related to the locally - periodic microstructure , considered in this work , so that the changes in the perforation are given on the @xmath6-level and can be approximated by the locally - periodic microstructure , which is periodic in each subdomain of size @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath6 is the size of the periodic cell , and @xmath9 is the dimension of considered domain .",
    "two - scale convergence is a special type of the convergence in @xmath10-spaces .",
    "it was introduced by nguetseng , @xcite , further developed in @xcite and is widely used for the homogenization of partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients or problems posed in media with periodic microstructures or with locally - periodic perforations ( named also as quasi - periodic perforations ) .",
    "admissible test functions used in the definition of two - scale convergence , are functions dependent on two variables : the fast microscopic and slow macroscopic variable , and periodic with respect to the fast variable .",
    "the two - scale convergence conserves the information regarding oscillations of the considered function sequence and overcomes difficulties resulting from weak convergence of fast oscillating periodic functions .    in this article",
    "we generalise the notion of the two - scale convergence to locally - periodic situations , see definition  [ def_two - scale ] .",
    "the considered test functions are locally - periodic approximations of the corresponding functions with the space - dependent periodicity with respect to the fast variable being dependent on the slow variable .",
    "this generalised notion of the two - scale convergence provides easier and more general techniques for homogenization of partial differential equations with locally - periodic coefficients or considered in domains with locally - periodic microstructures .",
    "the central result of the work is the compactness theorem  [ l2_lp_covregence ] for the locally periodic two - scale convergence and the characterisation of the locally - periodic two - scale limit for a sequence bounded in @xmath0 , theorem  [ compactness_theorem ] .",
    "the proofs indicates that local periodicity of the considered microstructure is essential for the convergence of spatial derivatives .",
    "due to the definition of a locally - periodic domain we have that the size of the subdomains with periodic microstructure is of order @xmath11 , where @xmath8 and @xmath6 is the size of the microstructure .",
    "thus , the gradient of the smooth approximations of characteristic functions of subdomains with periodic microstructures multiplied by @xmath6 is of order @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , and converges to zero as @xmath14 .",
    "this fact allows us to approximate the locally - periodic test function by differentiable functions and show the convergence of spatial derivatives .    in section  [ application ]",
    "we apply the locally - periodic two - scale convergence to derive macroscopic mechanical properties of biocomposites , comprising non - periodic microstructures . as an example of such a microstructure we consider the plywood structure of the exoskeleton of a lobster , @xcite .",
    "mechanical properties of the biomaterial are modelled by equations of linear elasticity , where the microscopic geometry and elastic properties of different components are reflected in the stiffness matrix of the microscopic equations .",
    "the fully non - periodic microstructure is approximated by a locally - periodic domain , provided the transformation matrix , describing the microstructure , is twice continuously differentiable .",
    "our calculations for the fully non - periodic situation were inspired by @xcite .",
    "note that the techniques developed in this article can be applied to derive macroscopic equations for a wide class of partial differential equations , and are not restricted to the problem of linear elasticity .",
    "the introduced convergence is also applicable to more general non - periodic transformations as transformation of centres of spherical balls .",
    "a major challenge in material science is the design of stable but light materials .",
    "many biomaterials feature excellent mechanical properties , such as strength or stiffness , regarding their low density .",
    "for example , the strength of bone is similar to that of steel , but it is three times lighter and ten times more flexible , @xcite .",
    "recent research suggests that this phenomenon is primarily a consequence of the hierarchical structure of biomaterials over several length scales , @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of the influence of microstructure on mechanical properties of biomaterials is not only a theoretical challenge by itself but may also help to improve the design and production of synthetic materials    here we consider the exoskeleton of a lobster as an example of such biomaterials .",
    "the exoskeleton is a hierarchical composite consisting of chitin - protein fibres , various proteins , mineral nanoparticles and water .",
    "a prototypical pattern found in the exoskeleton is the so - called twisted plywood structure , given as the superposition of planes of parallel aligned chitin - protein fibres , gradually rotated with rotation angle @xmath15 , @xcite .",
    "we would like to study elastic properties of a exoskeleton . in the formulation of the microscopic model defined on the scale of a single fibre",
    ", we shall distinguish between mechanical properties of fibres and inter - fibrous space .",
    "we assume that the fibres are cylinders of radius @xmath16 , perpendicular to the @xmath17-axis , whereas @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it has been observed that different parts of the exoskeleton comprise different rotation densities , @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall distinguish between the locally - periodic plywood structure , where the hight of layers of fibres aligned in the same direction is of order @xmath20 with @xmath8 , and the non - periodic microstructure , where each layer of fibres is rotated by a different angle , i.e. @xmath21 , see fig .",

    "the boundary condition and the right hand side describe the external forces applied to the material .",
    "the considered microstructure is locally - periodic , i.e. it is periodic in each layer @xmath26 , where the height of the layer @xmath20 is larger as the radius of a single fibre , but is small compared to the size of the considered domain @xmath35 , provide @xmath6 is sufficiently small .    to allow more general locally - periodic oscillations and microstructures",

    "the rotation angle is constant in each layer @xmath26 and the characteristic function of @xmath37 can also be defined considering the additional division of @xmath26 into cubes of side @xmath20 .",
