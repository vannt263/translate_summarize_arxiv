    "quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) is a general framework for the nuclear many - body problem @xcite .",
    "it is a renormalisable relativistic quantum field theory using hadronic degrees of freedom and has quite successfully described the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei . in the walecka model ( qhd - i ) with nucleons interacting with scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) mesons , it has been shown in the mean - field approximation that the saturation density and binding energy of nuclear matter may be fitted by adjusting the scalar and vector couplings @xcite .",
    "this was first done by neglecting the dirac sea and is called the no - sea approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "several groups have investigated the effects of scalar self - interactions in nuclear matter @xcite and finite nuclei @xcite using a mean - field approach .    to include the sea effects",
    ", one does a self - consistent sum of tadpole diagrams for the baryon propagator @xcite .",
    "this defines the relativistic hartree approximation .",
    "there have also been calculations including corrections to the binding energy up to two - loops @xcite , which are seen to be rather large as compared to the one - loop results .",
    "however , it is seen that using phenomenological monopole form factors to account for the composite nature of the nucleons , such contribution is reduced substantially @xcite so that it is smaller than the one - loop result .",
    "recently , form factors have been introduced as a cure to the unphysical modes , the so called landau poles @xcite , which one encounters while calculating the meson propagator as modified by the interacting baryon propagator of relativistic hartree approximation .",
    "there have been also attempts to calculate the form factors by vertex corrections @xcite",
    ". however , without inclusion of such form factors the mean - field theory is not stable against a perturbative loop expansion .",
    "this might be because the couplings involved here are too large ( of order of 10 ) and the theory is not asymptotically free .",
    "hence nonperturbative techniques need to be developed to consider nuclear many - body problems .",
    "the present work is a step in that direction including vacuum polarisation effects .",
    "the approximation scheme here uses a squeezed coherent type of construction for the ground state @xcite which amounts to an explicit vacuum realignment .",
    "the input here is equal - time quantum algebra for the field operators with a variational ansatz for the vacuum structure and does not use any perturbative expansion or feynman diagrams .",
    "we have earlier seen that this correctly yields the results of the gross - neveu model @xcite as obtained by summing an infinite series of one - loop diagrams .",
    "we have also seen that it reproduces the gap equation in an effective qcd hamiltonian @xcite as obtained through the solution of the schwinger - dyson equations for the effective quark propagator .",
    "we here apply such a nonperturbative method to study the quantum vacuum in nuclear matter .",
    "we organise the paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we study the vacuum polarisation effects in nuclear matter as simulated through a vacuum realignment with baryon - antibaryon condensates .",
    "the condensate function is determined through a minimisation of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the properties of nuclear matter as arising from such a vacuum are then studied and are seen to become identical to those obtained through the relativistic hartree approximation . in section 3 ,",
    "we generalise such a vacuum state to include sigma condensates also , which are favoured with a quartic term in the sigma field in the lagrangian .",
    "the quartic coupling is chosen to be positive which is necessary to consider vacuum polarisation effects from the sigma field .",
    "we also calculate the effective sigma mass arising through such quantum corrections as a function of density .",
    "the coupling here is chosen to give the value for the incompressibilty of nuclear matter in the correct range . finally , in section 4 , we summarise the results obtained through our nonperturbative approach and present an outlook .",
    "we start with the lagrangian density for the linear walecka model given as @xmath2 with @xmath3 in the above , @xmath4 , @xmath0 , and @xmath5 are the fields for the nucleon , @xmath0- , and @xmath1-mesons with masses @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we use the mean - field approximation for the meson fields and retain the quantum nature of the fermion fields @xcite .",
    "this amounts to taking meson fields as constant classical fields with translational invariance for nuclear matter .",
    "thus we shall replace    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the expectation value in nuclear matter and we have retained the zeroth component for the vector field to have nonzero expectation value .",

    "the first two terms of the same equation corresponds to the shift in the dirac sea arising from the change in the nucleon mass at finite density when @xmath0 acquires a vacuum expectation value , and consequent divergences cancel with the counter terms of ( [ ct ] ) with higher powers in @xmath79 @xcite .",
