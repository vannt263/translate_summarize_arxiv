    "a very active topic of research in hadron physics concerns the study and characterization of resonances , in order to establish whether they qualify as genuine @xmath1 or @xmath2 states or , alternatively , they behave more as hadron molecules generated dynamically .",
    "a series of pioneer works @xcite , based on a @xmath3-channel vector meson exchange force , already predicted a wealth of s - wave baryon resonances generated by coupled channel dynamics with effective hadronic degrees of freedom rather than quarks and gluons .",
    "the earlier approaches have been readapted in the last decade to the modern language of chiral lagrangians @xcite and many resonances in the light su(3 ) sector , which can not be described properly by quark models @xcite unless substantial meson - baryon components are included @xcite , have been identified with dynamical states generated from the interactions of mesons of the pseudoscalar @xmath4 octet with the @xmath5 ground state baryons .",
    "some consequences of these studies , such as the two - pole nature of the @xmath6 , are confirmed through the analyses @xcite of different experimental reactions @xcite .",
    "note that the basic structure of a molecular - type baryon is quite different from that implied by the quark models , even when they include the dressing with meson - baryon components , as in the @xmath7 formalism , where the @xmath2 hilbert space is coupled to the meson - baryon hilbert space through the creation of a @xmath8 pair @xcite . in the former case the degrees of freedom",
    "are purely hadronic and the resonances must be seen as pseudo - bound states of two hadrons , while in the later case the essential component of a baryon is still of three quark nature .",
    "a goal in hadron physics research is to distinguish between both pictures from thorough analyses of as many properties of the hadron as possible , such as the mass , width , magnetic moment , form - factors , etc     in recent years it was demonstrated that besides the @xmath9-wave baryon resonances many more states can be generated dynamically .",
    "baryon resonances with @xmath10 were studied based on the leading order chiral lagrangian with the decuplet @xmath11 fields @xcite .",
    "@xmath12-wave baryon resonances were also generated dynamically with vector meson degrees of freedom in refs .",
    "another promising line of research is the recent interpretation of low lying @xmath13 resonances as molecular states of two pseudoscalar mesons and one baryon @xcite .",
    "all these results support the so - called hadrogenesis conjecture , formulated a few years ago by lutz and kolomeitsev , according to which resonances not belonging to the large-@xmath14 ground state of qcd are generated by coupled - channel dynamics @xcite .",
    "the study of charmed hadrons is receiving an increased attention thanks to the efforts of a series of collaborations , both at lepton colliders ( cleo , belle , babar ) and hadron facilities ( cdf@fermilab , phenix and star@rhic , fair@gsi ) .",
    "the new results confirm with better statistics previously seen charmed states but are also giving rise to the discovery of a large amount of new hadrons @xcite .",
    "coupled - channel unitary schemes have been recently extended to include the charm degree of freedom and have been applied to the description of open and hidden charm mesons , with the observation that some states admit a straightforward interpretation as meson molecules @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been used for describing baryons with charm , motivated in part by a clear parallelism between the behavior of the @xmath6 in the @xmath15 sector with the @xmath16 in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 one @xcite . to be consistent with the spin - flavour heavy quark symmetry that develops in this heavy sector @xcite ,",
    "the vector mesons and @xmath19 baryons have recently been included in the basis of meson - baryon states , employing a static spin - flavour su(8 ) scheme @xcite similar to that developed in the light sector @xcite . treating the @xmath12 and @xmath20 mesons on an equal footing basis",
    "has lead to the observation that some of the dynamical generated states , such as the @xmath16 , have mostly a @xmath21 composition rather than the @xmath22 molecular nature . in any case , the observation that some of the dynamically generated charmed hadrons can be readily identified with observed resonances , such as the @xmath23 @xmath16 or the @xmath10 @xmath24 charmed baryons , sustains the hadrogenesis conjecture @xcite .",
    "apart from the different basis of states included in the models , a common feature of all the previous works is the use of an interaction based on the @xmath3-channel exchange of vector mesons , as the driving force for the @xmath25wave scattering of pseudo - scalar mesons off ground state baryons .",
    "the limit @xmath26 is applied , leading to a vector type wt zero - range interaction .",
    "this procedure is justified for on - shell meson - baryon transitions , @xmath27 , which are diagonal ( @xmath28 ) and hence the value of @xmath3 is small as long as one is not too far from threshold .",
    "it also holds for non - diagonal amplitudes ( @xmath29 ) that show a moderate difference of masses between the initial and final mesons and baryons involved , as is the case of meson - baryon scattering within the light su(3 ) world .",
    "however , the coupled channel dynamics in the heavy sector finds also charm - exchange processes for which the difference of masses between the external mesons are comparable with the mass of the charmed vector meson being exchanged .",
    "this clearly signals the breakdown of the zero - range approximation which is no longer reliable for these non - diagonal transitions .",
    "while one may still argue that many of the dynamically generated states are triggered by a single dominant meson - baryon interaction component and , hence , their energy can be well estimated by the pole position of an uncoupled calculation involving only diagonal amplitudes , the corresponding width will however be determined by non - diagonal amplitudes and will therefore depend on whether the @xmath0 approximation is implemented or not .",
    "moreover , it is well known that some resonances owe their origin to a particularly strong coupling between different channels , hence involving non - diagonal transitions , in which case the @xmath0 approximation is not at all appropriate for these states .    in the present work we study",
    "the charmed baryon resonances obtained dynamically from the interaction of the low lying pseudo - scalar mesons with the ground state baryons within a coupled channel approach , using the full @xmath3-dependence of the t - channel vector - exchange driving term , instead of the @xmath0 approximation .",
    "we incorporate the @xmath3-dependence within a general four - dimensional integration scheme , which we reduce to a three - dimensional equation of the  lippmann - schwinger \" type , and analyze in detail the effects of going beyond the @xmath0 approximation within this scheme .",

    "[ fig : tm2 ] , keeping the @xmath3-dependence in the denominator of the kernel [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) ] will decrease the strength of the diagonal transitions , since in this case @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , in order to reproduce a given resonance found in local models , the present approach will in general need to compensate the lack of strength with a higher value of the cut - off momentum used to regularize the loop integrals . on the other hand ,",
    "non - diagonal amplitudes , responsible mainly for the decay width of the dynamically generated states , will be enhanced since they are characterized by a positive time - like @xmath3 value due to the large mass difference between the mesons and baryons involved in the transition . as a consequence",
    ", our resonances will be wider than those found in the local models .    retaining the @xmath3-dependence in the kernel implies additional analytical structures @xcite which prevent us from obtaining the scattering amplitudes by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation using on - shell amplitudes only .",
    "instead , we incorporate the @xmath3-dependence within a more general four - dimensional integration scheme , which we reduce to a three - dimensional equation of the  lippmann - schwinger \" type . to this end , for a given value of the total scattering energy , we will evaluate the transition potential between any arbitrary pair of relative momenta within the cut - off value , keeping the dependence on the momentum transfer in the corresponding matrix element .",
    "this procedure follows the same spirit of the usual meson - exchange models of the @xmath74 interaction @xcite , also applied to meson - baryon scattering models @xcite .",
    "we note that keeping the full @xmath3 dependence in the exchanged meson propagator also implies that retardation effects are implemented as done in the three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is different than the prescription based on time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "both choices differ in the way off - shell effects are implemented and their differences in the @xmath74 sector show up especially in the contributions of the two - meson exchange box diagrams @xcite not included in the present model . in any case",
    ", observables can be matched to experimental data with either choice of retardation effects by selecting appropriate values of the renormalization parameters .",
    "we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sk ] ) to ( [ eq : t ] ) assume infinitely lived ( zero width ) exchanged vector mesons , while some of them have large widths due to their strong decay into a pair of mesons , like the @xmath59 meson contributing to diagonal channels .",
    "we have checked , however , that the value of @xmath3 is never larger than the square of the minimum energy required for the meson to decay , namely @xmath75 in the case of @xmath59 exchange or @xmath76 for @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , the mesons being exchanged in this problem are largely off - shell and they will be treated as stable particles .",
    "once the scattering kernel has been constructed , we can obtain the @xmath77-matrices which describe the scattering of the pseudo - scalar meson fields off the baryon fields by solving the well known lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation @xmath78 where @xmath79 we have introduced a dipole - type form factor @xmath80 @xmath81 to regularize the integral .",
    "this form is typically adopted in studies of hadron - hadron interactions within the scheme of lippmann - schwinger - type equations in the light flavour sector @xcite .",
    "the value of the cut - off @xmath82 is a free parameter of our model . given the limited amount of data for charmed baryon resonances , and in order to simplify the analysis , the cut - off @xmath82 is adjusted to the position of a well known @xmath23 state in a particular isospin and strangeness sector , and the same value is used for the other sectors explored in this work .",
    "we will also investigate the effect of a gaussian - type form factor , as well as the dependence of our results on the value of the cut - off employed .",
    "note that the approaches based on the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation solved with on - shell amplitudes ignore the off - shellness ( momentum dependence ) of the kernel and scattering amplitude in the loop function .",
    "actually , the on - shell factorization can only be justified within the @xmath83 form of the potential which is obtained after applying the @xmath26 limit .",
    "another aspect worth commenting is the different extrapolation of the kernel at subthreshold energies . while the kernel of the on - shell bs approaches depends on @xmath58 in the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t0 ] ) upon replacing @xmath84 by @xmath85 , the potential used in the tri - dimensional lippmann  schwinger equation depends essentially on the incoming and outgoing tri - momenta .",
    "these are always taken real quantities in our approach , hence the sum of the four single particle energies is always larger than the sum of the two meson - baryon thresholds involved in the transition .",
    "an explicit dependence on @xmath58 is only implemented in the meson - baryon intermediate propagator of the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation that determines the scattering amplitudes .",
    "therefore , at subthreshold energies , the factor in the numerator of the kernel used in on - shell bs approaches is smaller than in the present work .",
    "this in part compensates the enhancement in diagonal transitions associated to the @xmath26 limit . in any case",
    ", the free parameters of the model ( cut - off values ) can finally be conveniently fine - tuned to adjust the energy position of a well known resonance , as is usually done for the case of the @xmath16 appearing about 200 mev below the threshold of the channel @xmath61 to which it couples very strongly . in this respect ,",
    "the differences between the present work and the on - shell bs approaches will be made more evident in properties tied to non - diagonal transitions which are reduced in the @xmath86 limit , as is the case of the resonance widths .    in order to associate a given enhancement of the scattering amplitude to a resonance , we look for a characteristic pole in the unphysical sheet of the complex energy plane .",
    "our prescription of unphysical sheet is such that , whenever the real part of the complex energy crosses a meson - baryon threshold cut , the sign of the on - shell momentum is changed for this channel and for the already opened ones , as described in detail in ref .",
    "once a pole @xmath87 is found , its value determines the breit - wigner mass ( @xmath88 ) and width ( @xmath89 ) of the resonance , as seen from real energies , if the pole is not too far from the real axis .",
    "the couplings of the resonances into the meson - baryon components of a given sector are obtained from the residues of the scattering amplitude since , close to the pole , it can be parameterized in the form : @xmath90 note that , as it stands , the value of the coupling constants of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pole ] ) depend on the particular momentum values chosen in the evaluation of the @xmath77-matrix element .",
    "since we are only interested on the size of the couplings relative to the various channels , we take the prescription of evaluating them for the case @xmath91 .",
    "one of the main interests of this paper is to study the effects of going beyond the @xmath0 approximation in the kernel , as has been customarily done .",
    "we have already anticipated in the previous section that , in the case of coupled channel problems involving light and heavy flavored particles , this approximation is not always justified .",
    ".coupled - channel meson - baryon states with charm @xmath17 and all possible combinations of isospin , strangeness ( i , s ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied charmed baryon resonances obtained from a coupled channels unitary approach using a t - channel vector - exchange driving force .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all previous models of dynamically generated baryon resonances in the charm sector rely on a local zero - range interaction , which is obtained by neglecting the four - momentum transfer @xmath3 in front of the mass of the exchanged vector meson squared , @xmath92 .",
    "however , we have illustrated that the value @xmath64 is not at all negligible in the heavy sector , especially for charm - exchange amplitudes which produce a large value of the four - momentum transfer due to the large difference bewteen the masses of the mesons involved in the transition .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the effects of going beyond the @xmath0 approximation and , taking the @xmath93 , @xmath17 , @xmath94 sector of the well established @xmath95 @xmath16 resonance as reference , we find that the experimental data is better reproduced by the non - local model which also requires a more reasonable cut - off regularization value of 903 mev .",
    "compared to the local models based on on - shell amplitudes , our approach obtains basically the same amount of resonances in all sectors but appearing , in general , at somewhat larger energies because the diagonal amplitudes , largely responsible for generating the bound states , are smaller in magnitude .",
    "an essential finding of this work is that our non - local approach produces much wider resonances because of the larger value of the non - diagonal amplitudes when @xmath96 .",
    "varying the cut - off parameter within a reasonable range , we are able to locate some of our states at the energy position of a measured resonance in the same sector . in particular , we suggest the identification of the @xmath16 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 as dynamically generated resonances having @xmath23 . in general , the widths of the states produced by our model are smaller than the experimentally observed ones , since we do not account for three - particle decay channels .",
    "we find a possible resonance in the sector with quantum numbers @xmath100 that can only be realized by the consideration of a minimum of five quarks .",
    "the cusp - like structure observed at the threshold of the @xmath101 channel for a cut - off value of 903 mev , becomes a more bound and wider clear resonance as the cut - off value increases .",
    "this is the first exploratory study of the effects tied to the non - locality of the meson - baryon interaction in the charm sector .",
    "we have considered meson - baryon coupled states built up from the @xmath102 mesons and the ground state @xmath13 baryons . however , heavy quark symmetry demands that the states containing heavy vector mesons are treated on equal footing due to the similarity of the masses with the heavy pseudoscalar ones .",
