    "suppose that @xmath3 is an intractable probability density that we would like to explore . consider a data augmentation ( da ) algorithm [ @xcite , @xcite ] based on the joint density @xmath4 , which of course must satisfy @xmath5 we are assuming here that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two sets equipped with countably generated @xmath8-algebras , and that @xmath9 is a density with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "the markov chain underlying the da algorithm , which we denote by @xmath11 , has markov transition density ( mtd ) given by @xmath12 in other words , @xmath13 is the density of @xmath14 , given that @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known and easy to see that the product @xmath16 is symmetric in @xmath17 , that is , the da markov chain is reversible with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "( we assume throughout that all markov chains on the target space , @xmath6 , are harris ergodic , that is , irreducible , aperiodic and harris recurrent . ) of course , the da markov chain can be simulated by drawing alternately from the two conditional densities defined by @xmath9 .",
    "if the current state is @xmath15 , then  @xmath14 is simulated in two steps : draw @xmath19 , call the result @xmath20 , and then draw @xmath21 .    like its cousin",
    "the em algorithm , the da algorithm can be very slow to converge . a powerful method for speeding up the da algorithm was discovered independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind the method ( called `` px - da '' by liu and wu and `` marginal augmentation '' by meng and van dyk ) is to introduce a ( low - dimensional ) parameter into the joint density @xmath9 that is not identifiable in the target , @xmath18 .",
    "this allows for the construction of an entire class of viable da algorithms , some of which may converge much faster than the original .",
    "here is a brief description of the method in the context where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are euclidean spaces , and @xmath9 is a density with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "suppose that for each @xmath22 in some set @xmath23 , there is a function that is one - to - one and differentiable .",
    "consider a parametric family of densities ( indexed by @xmath22 ) given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the jacobian of the transformation @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 , so @xmath22 is not identifiable in @xmath18 .",
    "now fix a `` working prior '' density on  @xmath22 , call it  @xmath28 , and define a joint density on @xmath29 as follows : @xmath30 clearly , the @xmath31-marginal of @xmath32 is the target , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , each working prior leads to a new da algorithm that is potentially better than the original one based on @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite find the working priors that lead to particularly fast algorithms .",
    "of course , one iteration of the da algorithm based on @xmath32 could be simulated using the usual two - step method ( described above ) which entails drawing from the two conditional densities defined by @xmath32 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that this simulation can also be accomplished using a _ three - step _ procedure in which the first and third steps are draws from  @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , and the middle step involves a  single move according to a markov chain on the space @xmath7 that has invariant density  @xmath35 . in this paper",
    ", we study a generalization of liu and wu s ( @xcite ) three - step procedure that was introduced by @xcite and is now described .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 is any markov transition function ( mtf ) on @xmath7 that is reversible with respect to @xmath37 , that is , @xmath38 .",
    "consider a new mtd given by @xmath39 it s easy to see that @xmath40 is symmetric in @xmath17 , so the markov chain defined by @xmath41 , which we denote by @xmath42 , is reversible with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "if the current state of the new chain is @xmath43 , then @xmath44 can be simulated using the following three - steps , which are suggested by the form of @xmath41 .",
    "draw @xmath45 , call the result @xmath20 , then draw @xmath46 , call the result @xmath47 , and finally draw @xmath48 . again",
    ", the first and third steps are exactly the two steps used to simulate the original da algorithm .",
    "because the draw from @xmath49 is `` sandwiched '' between the draws from the two conditional densities , @xcite call this new algorithm the `` sandwich algorithm '' and we will follow their lead . the px - da / marginal augmentation method can be viewed as one particular recipe for constructing  @xmath36 . another general method for building @xmath50 is described in section  [ secgroup ] .",
    "it is often possible to construct a sandwich algorithm that converges much faster than the underlying da algorithm while requiring roughly the same computational effort per iteration .",
    "examples can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "what makes this `` free lunch '' possible is the somewhat surprising fact that a low - dimensional perturbation on the @xmath7 space can lead to a major improvement in mixing .",
    "in fact , the chain driven by @xmath50 is typically reducible , living in a small subspace of @xmath7 that is determined by its starting value .",
    "drawing from such an @xmath50 is usually much less expensive computationally than drawing from @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "empirical studies pointing to the superiority of the sandwich algorithm abound .",
    "unfortunately , the development of confirmatory theoretical results has been slow .",
    "it is known that the sandwich chain always converges at least as fast as the da chain in the operator norm sense .",
    "indeed , @xcite show that yu and meng s ( @xcite ) theorem 1 can be used to show that @xmath51 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath50 denote the usual markov operators defined by @xmath52 , @xmath41 and  @xmath36 , respectively , and denotes the operator norm .",
    "( see section  [ secreview ] for more details as well as references . )",
    "of course , we would like to be able to say that @xmath53 is strictly smaller than @xmath54 , and this is certainly the case when @xmath55 .",
    "however , the @xmath50 s used in practice typically have norm 1 ( because the corresponding chains are reducible ) .",
    "in fact , in most applications , @xmath50 is reducible and idempotent , that is , @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite provided a refinement of ( [ eqnorms ] ) for the case in which @xmath7 is finite and @xmath50 is reducible and idempotent .",
    "these authors showed that , in this case , @xmath1 and @xmath2 both have pure eigenvalue spectra that are subsets of @xmath57 , and that at most @xmath58 of the eigenvalues are nonzero , where @xmath59 .",
    "they also showed that the spectrum of @xmath2 dominates that of @xmath1 in the sense that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the @xmath61th largest eigenvalues of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that taking @xmath64 yields @xmath65 .    in this paper we develop results that hold in the far more common situation where @xmath66 .",
    "first , we generalize hobert , roy and robert s ( @xcite ) result by showing that the assumption that @xmath7 is finite can be replaced by the substantially weaker assumption that @xmath67 . in this more general case , @xmath1 and @xmath2 still have pure eigenvalue spectra that are subsets of @xmath57 and an analogous domination holds , but the number of nonzero eigenvalues is no longer necessarily finite .",
    "second , we show that if @xmath50 is constructed using a group action , as described by @xcite and @xcite , then the domination is strict in the sense that there exists at least one @xmath61 such that @xmath68 .",
    "finally , we apply our results to a new da algorithm for bayesian quantile regression that was recently introduced by @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ secreview ] contains a  brief review of the relationship between the spectral properties of markov operators and the convergence properties of the corresponding markov chains .",
    "the da and sandwich algorithms are formally defined and compared in section [ secalgorithms ] .",
    "the construction of @xmath50 using group actions is discussed in section [ secgroup ] , and our analysis of kozumi and kobayashi s da algorithm is described in section [ secexample ] .",

    "the convergence properties of @xmath73 can be expressed in terms of a related operator that is now defined .",

    "@xcite show that @xmath91 if and only if @xmath73 is geometrically ergodic .",
    "moreover , in the geometrically ergodic case , @xmath92 can be viewed as the asymptotic rate of convergence of @xmath73 [ see , e.g. , @xcite , page  170 ] .    if @xmath71 satisfies additional regularity conditions , much more can be said about the convergence of the corresponding markov chain .",
    "assume that the operator @xmath71 is compact and positive , and let @xmath93 denote its eigenvalues , all of which reside in @xmath57 .",
    "the number of eigenvalues may be finite or countably infinite ( depending on the cardinality of @xmath6 ) , but in either case there is a largest one and it is equal to @xmath92 .",
    "[ for a basic introduction to the spectral properties of markov operators , see @xcite . ]",
    "if @xmath94 , then @xmath71 is a _ trace - class _ operator [ see , e.g. , @xcite , page 267 ] . as explained in @xcite , when @xmath71 is positive and trace - class , the chain s @xmath95-distance to stationarity",
    "can be written explicitly as @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the density of @xmath98 given that @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is an orthonormal basis of eigen - functions corresponding to @xmath93 .",
    "of course , the @xmath95-distance serves as an upper bound on the total variation distance .",
    "assume that the eigenvalues are ordered so that @xmath101 , and let @xmath102 .",
    "asymptotically , the term @xmath103 will dominate the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ eqrep ] ) .",
    "hence , in this context it is certainly reasonable to call @xmath104 the `` asymptotic rate of convergence . ''",
    "our focus in this paper will be on da algorithms whose markov operators are trace - class .",
    "as in section  [ secintro ] , let @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the ( self - adjoint ) markov operators defined by the da chain , the sandwich chain and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we will exploit the fact that  @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be represented as products of simpler operators .",

    "this representation of  @xmath1 was used in @xcite .    again , as in section [ secintro ] , let @xmath116 be the joint density that defines the da markov chain . throughout the next two sections , we assume that @xmath117 satisfies the following condition : @xmath118 @xcite shows that ( [ eqct ] ) implies that @xmath1 is a trace - class operator .",
    "it is clear that  ( [ eqct ] ) holds if @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 has a finite number of elements .",
    "however ,  ( [ eqct ] ) can also hold in situations where @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , in section [ secexample ] we establish that ( [ eqct ] ) holds for a da algorithm for bayesian quantile regression where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both uncountable . on the other hand , ( [ eqct ] )",
    "certainly does not hold for all da algorithms .",
    "for example , ( [ eqct ] ) can not hold if the da chain is not geometrically ergodic ( because subgeometric chains can not be trace - class ) .",
    "simple examples of subgeometric da chains can be found in @xcite and @xcite , chapter 4 .",
    "condition ( [ eqct ] ) has appeared in the markov chain monte carlo literature before .",
    "it is exactly the bivariate version of liu , wong and kong s ( @xcite ) `` condition ( b ) '' and it was also employed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there does not appear to be any simple , intuitive interpretation of ( [ eqct ] ) in terms of the joint density @xmath9 or the corresponding markov chain .",
    "in fact , referring to their condition ( b ) , @xcite state that `` it is standard but not easy to check and understand . ''    our analysis of the da and sandwich algorithms rests heavily upon a  useful _ singular value decomposition _ of @xmath9 whose existence is implied by  ( [ eqct ] ) . in particular , @xcite shows that if ( [ eqct ] ) holds , then @xmath120 where :    * @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 . * @xmath124 and @xmath125 form orthonormal bases of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . * @xmath128 $ ] , and @xmath129 for all @xmath130 . * @xmath131 if @xmath132 .    a few remarks about notation",
    "are in order .",
    "first , we state all results for the case @xmath119 , and leave it to the reader to make the obvious , minor modifications that are required when one or both of the spaces are finite .",
    "for example , in the singular value decomposition above , if one or both of the spaces are finite , then one or both of the orthonormal bases would have only a finite number of elements , etc .",
    "second , we will let @xmath133 and do double duty as inner product and norm on both @xmath74 and @xmath134 .",
    "however , the norms of operators whose domains and ranges differ will be subscripted .",
