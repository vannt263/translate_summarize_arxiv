    "nuclear chromosomes in eukaryotic organisms consist of the chromatin , a complex wrap that is primarily composed of dna and histone proteins .",
    "the fundamental unit of the chromatin is the nucleosome , each of which contains two copies of the core histones h2a , h2b , h3 and h4 , and approximately @xmath0 base pairs of dna .",
    "each of the core histone proteins exhibits multiple amino acid residues that are subject to post - translational modifications ( ptm ) by chemical groups such as phospho- , acetyl- , methyl- or ubiquitin - groups that can be added and removed in a reversible manner .",
    "for example , h4 has a phosphorylation site , four acetylation sites and six methylation sites .",
    "depending on the particular modification state of histones , certain regions of dna in the chromatin are in an active or repressed state .",
    "regulation of the ptms of histones lies at the center of epigenetic control @xcite .",
    "a commonly observed epigenetic phenomenon is the existence of alternative regulatory states .",
    "for example , in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe the two mating type cassettes , mat2-p and mat3-m are usually in a silenced state in which the mating type genes are not expressed . when removing a portion of the silenced region and inserting a ura4 + reporter gene , the expression of ura4 + and the mating - type genes becomes bistable , with a state where ura4 + is repressed and a state where ura4 + is expressed  @xcite .",
    "the silenced state of ura4 + is associated with a high concentration of methylation marks on lysine of histone h3 ( h3k9 ) , while the active ura4 + state does not exhibit methylation of h3k9  @xcite .",
    "each of the two epigenetic states is preserved under cell divisions , with transitions between them occuring only at a very low rate .",
    "post - translational modifications are regulated by various enzymes . in order to explain the appearance of multiple stable histone states ,",
    "a non - local positive feedback mechanism has been put forward  @xcite : a nucleosome that exhibits a particular modification recruits the enzymes that catalyze this modification . these enzymes",
    "then move to adjacent nucleosomes and cause the modification to be added there , a mechanism that has indeed been observed for some histone acetyltransferases , histone decacetylases and histone methyltransferases  @xcite .",
    "long - range feedback has been implemented in a stochastic simulation of a three - state model ( unmodified state , acetylated state , methylated state ) and it was shown to lead to robust bistability  @xcite .",
    "nearest - neighbour feedback has been considered in deterministic descriptions of two- and three - state models  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite consider a two - state mean - field  @xcite description that takes into account cooperativity in binding of enzymes , and they discuss the bifurcation diagram , including the effects of spatial dependence . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results of a stochastic simulation are compared to those of a mean - field description that does not explicitly consider spatial dependence .",
    "perturbations due to cell divisions were considered , and instability of stable steady states due to such perturbations were found in the stochastic simulation , but not the mean - field approach .",
    "it is an open question how to obtain mean - field equations in the continuum starting from a stochastic description that predict the instabilities due to spatial dependance that are observed in the microscopic simulations . among other things ,",
    "this is one of the questions that we address in this work .",
    "the considerable number of independently regulated modification sites in the chromatin has been hypothesized to give rise to a  histone code \"  @xcite : there are @xmath1 possible combinations of modified / unmodified configurations of @xmath2 independently regulated ptms , each of which potentially corresponds to a distinct  read - out \" of information and ultimately a different epigenetic outcome .",
    "recent efforts in identifying abundances of these histone modification states ( also denoted as histone isoforms ) have revealed that only few of the large number of possible isoforms are actually observed  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that regulation of different ptms is correlated .",
    "for example , phosphorylation of h3 ser10 stimulates acetylation of h3 lys14 @xcite , and methylation of h3 lys4 and lys79 requires the ubiquitiniation of h2b lys123 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider how such correlations in the regulation of ptms reduce the information capacity of histone states .",
    "in particular , we study a model that is motivated by an interaction in the h3 n terminus where ser10 phosphorylation inhibits lys9 methylation  @xcite .",
    "we consider a master equation description of the stochastic dynamics of histone states ( section  [ stochdyn ] ) .",
    "the system consists of a large number of nucleosomes , where each nucleosome exhibits several ptms that are regulated by a particular class of enzymes .",
    "we take into account the reversible addition and removal of ptms due to enzymatic activity , as well as on - site (  local \" ) and nearest - neighbour (  non - local \" ) feedback mechanisms where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that either act locally or diffuse to adjacent nucleosomes .",
    "we use a quantum many - body formulation of the master equation  la doi@xcite and a tensor product state ansatz to obtain a system of nonlinear difference equations ( section  [ mapping ] ) .",
    "we believe that the continuum limit of these equations is a suitable mean - field description that captures the role of spatial dependance in the master equation .",
    "the reader who is not interested in the derivation of the nonlinear difference equations / partial differential equations can go directly to eqs .",
    "( [ pde_system ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ contpde ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ pde_system2 ] ) .",
    "we numerically study the system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( section  [ results ] ) .",
    "when considering one type of post - translational modification , and including at least two modification sites , bistable steady states are obtained without the necessity of explicit cooperativity at the level of the stochastic description ( section  [ ode ] ) .",
    "the two stable steady states correspond to an unmodified state and a state with a high number of ptms .",
    "we observe that increasing the number of modification sites increases the size of the parameter regime where bistable steady states exist . for a large number of modification sites , bistability is possible even if the coupling strength of the feedback mechanism is weak compared to the coupling strength of local processes .",
    "we observe that the spatial dependance due to the non - local feedback mechanism leads to instabilities of steady states under certain spatial perturbations of the histone state ( section  [ spatialdependance ] ) .",
    "these instabilities manifest themselves in traveling wave solutions of the system of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "we also consider spatially dependent rate parameters , which arise from adaptor proteins , such as dna binding transcription factors , that recruit histone modifying enzymes to specific regions of chromatin ( section  [ hetparameters ] ) .",
    "we discuss how such spatially dependent enzyme activity gives rise to spatial heterogeneity in the epigenetic state .",
    "finally , we introduce a model of two types ptms that are regulated by different classes of enzymes and mutually inhibit each other ( section  [ multiple_ptms ] ) .",
    "such mechanisms are present in the chromatin , for example , in the case of h3 ser10 phosphorylation that inhibits h3 lys9 methylation  @xcite .",
    "we find that inhibition in one direction is sufficient to reduce the full combinatorial set of four stable steady states to a set of three stable steady states where the presence of the two types of ptm is mutually exclusive .",
    "we conclude by discussing open problems and future directions .",
