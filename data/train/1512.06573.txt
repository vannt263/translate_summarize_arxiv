    "moreover , both cnet and sf22 have a fixed degree of internal nodes @xmath116 , which reduces the branching possibilities for the tunnelings , in contrast with the nnet , where a broader degree distribution of nodes is found @xcite .",

    "[ fig - nanonets ] .",
    "in contrast , the point - size electrodes are attached to two periphery nodes in cnet and two nanoparticles at the opposite ends of the 1dwd chain .",
    "the situation with point - size electrodes in cnet in fig.[fig - nanonets ] readily illustrates the importance of local structure for the collective charge transport of the assembly .",
    "increasing voltage bias permits tunnelings between the electrode and the first layer , consisting of two connected nanoparticles .",

    "it should be stressed that the part of the data for small returns and small avalanches in these two nanonetworks virtually coincides with the ones found in the chain and sf22 structures .",

    "cc +    cc    notably , the randomized time series results in a graph exhibiting much simpler structure than the other graphs , which represent the fractal time series .",
    "the topological complexity of these qts - graphs manifests in the occurrence of a vast number of topological levels @xmath129 in accord with the number of combinatorial spaces and their interconnections at higher topological levels . as an example , in fig.[fig - qtsnets ] we display the qts - graph of nnet assembly . in two separate plots",
    "we also demonstrate the complexity of its top topological levels , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "among these , five groups contain higher cliques , leaving at most 12 groups that are visually distinct in the top right figure [ fig - qtsnets ] .",
    "in contrast , the single 11-clique in qts - graph of cnet remains isolated down to the level @xmath132 ( cf .",

    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - qtsnets ] bottom right .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig - svs ] , the second structure vectors of qts - graphs of sf22 and 1dwd exhibit certain similarity .",
    "interestingly enough , the presence of charge disorder in the linear chain of nanoparticles leads to a more complex qts - graph than the sf22 assembly .",
    "namely , the charge disorder blocks the only existing path in the linear chain , which results in a sequence of zero entries in the time series , which is mapped onto a large clique linked to two or more near non - zero entries . in contrast , blocking a linear segment in sf22 structure causes tunnelings along the alternative paths .",
    "hence , no abrupt changes in the time series occur .",
    "apart from the high topology levels , the similarity between the qts - graphs of nnet and cnet , on one side , and sf22 and 1dwd , on the other , is apparent at lower @xmath108-levels , cf .",
    "[ fig - svs ] .",
    "these findings also apply to the topological response function @xmath112 and the entropy @xmath133 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - entropy ] .",
    "the occurrence of mutually isolated cliques , i.e , at @xmath97 or @xmath134 , leads to the occupation probability @xmath135 and the entropy close to zero .",
    "the simplicial complexes that occur at the intermediate @xmath108-levels share the faces at the level @xmath136 .",
    "hence , same nodes participate in the identified complexes , leading to a lower occupation probability of the level and the entropy drops , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - entropy ] .",
    "the 2-dimensional nanoparticle assemblies exhibit complex qts - graphs in which a large number of simplicial complexes , sharing many nodes , is observed .",
    "in contrast , a small number of such compounds occur in the case of the linear chain structure with charge disorder .",
    "thus , a reduced number of nodes are involved ; this situation manifests in a more pronounced entropy minimum at @xmath137 than in the other graphs .",
    "using the extensive numerical study at different scales , we have demonstrated how the structure of tunneling junctions in the arrays of metallic nanoparticles affects the collective nature of the charge transport within the coulomb - blockade regime .",
    "the simulations of single - electron tunnelings in nanoparticle arrays of different architecture are combined with the fractal analysis of time series and algebraic topology techniques applied to the abstract graphs in the state space .",
    "we quantitatively describe the aggregate fluctuations at the global scale ; the collective dynamics builds on communication among local events , which is enabled by the structural features of the nanoparticle network with junctions .",
    "two structural components can locally affect the formation of the conducting paths between the electrodes encasing the array .",
    "these are the branching at each nanoparticle , which increases geometrical entanglement of the conduction paths , and the presence of linear segments whose tunneling conduction is better understood , which reduces it .",
    "the comparative analysis of different nanonetworks in conjunction with the size of electrodes leads to the following general conclusions .",
    "* a higher level of cooperation in the charge fluctuations through the sample that is measured by the fractal indicators of the time series is consistent with a larger topological complexity of the phase space manifolds yielding an enhanced @xmath4 nonlinearity beyond the voltage threshold . * a suitable combination of the local branching and global topological defects that allow a formation of large draining basins , as illustrated by nnet structure in our analysis , enables an enhanced collective dynamics . *",
    "the size of electrodes can considerably influence the strength of aggregate fluctuations , and thus the structure of the complex phase space and the @xmath4 curve .",
    "in particular , point - size electrodes enhance the formation of several nearly - shortest paths ; they can be physically close to each other in arrays of a compact structure with an extensive branching along the main path .",
    "a good example is cnet studied in this work . on the other hand , the presence of significant linear segments , such as sf22 , increases the difference between the path lengths , which reduces the probability of a coordinated drainage . in such cases ,",
    "extended electrodes allow the formation of several channels of a similar structure .",
    "our analysis also sheds a new light onto the effects of the charge disorder on the system s conduction capabilities .",
    "both the temporal correlations and the topology of phase space manifolds demonstrate dramatic effects of charge disorder in the linear chain of nanoparticles , which comprises a single conduction path . in a two - dimensional array , such as sf22 ,",
    "blocking some linear segments of the structure by charge disorder affects the morphology of conduction basins , resulting in a reduced current .",
    "the presented results reveal how the architecture implicates the emergent conduction features of nanoparticle assemblies .",
    "they may serve as a guide for the design of the nanoparticle devices with improved conduction .",
    "we have not explicitly considered the effects of finite temperature and varied widths of the tunneling junctions , which often appear in the experiments .",
    "they also may alter the tunneling process at the local scale and , according to this work , imply changes in the collective charge fluctuations .",
    "apart from these practical aspects , our work stresses the importance of different modeling approaches . in this context , the methods of algebraic topology applied to the graphs in the system s phase space are opening a new perspective for the analysis of fluctuations at a nanoscale .",
