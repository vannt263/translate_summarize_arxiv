    "<S> the significant residual nematic fluctuations observed between @xmath62 k and @xmath6 ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fluct](a , c ) ) are consistent with @xmath63 nmr measurements that show coexisting afm and paramagnetic regions in this @xmath40-interval @xcite ; the paramagnetic regions are expected to host the residual nematic fluctuations observed here . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the temperature where the qep area and height are maxima , @xmath64 , does not coincide with the bulk - average @xmath5 , contrary to other parent fescs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation is likely related to the soft structural transition characteristic of the 1111 parent fescs @xcite , with a broad @xmath40 interval where tetragonal and orthorhombic domains coexist and fluctuate @xcite . in this scenario , while the qep intensity per orthorhombic unit volume is expected to be reduced on cooling , the inverse tendency is found for the remaining tetragonal domains , leading to @xmath65 . </S>",

    "<S> this is again qualitatively consistent with @xmath63 nmr results that show a slowing down of the magnetic dynamics below @xmath5 @xcite and may be also related with the enhancement of the magnetic correlation length below @xmath5 observed in inelastic neutron scattering measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to the electronic raman signal in @xmath2 symmetry , the @xmath39 qep strengthens on cooling down to base @xmath40 , and thus is not associated with electronic excitations directly related with nematicity . besides the thermal broadening of the @xmath39 qep that may be approximated by a linear @xmath40-dependence , an extra contribution to the transition rate @xmath66 is observed between @xmath3 and @xmath67 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fluct](b ) ) , corresponding to the same @xmath40-interval where the @xmath2 signal from nematic fluctuations is most clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that nematic fluctuations lead to an electronically disordered state for @xmath68 that enhance the relaxation rate of the @xmath39 excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results considering separately the independent scenarios where charge / orbital or spin nematic fluctuations dominate the intensity of the @xmath2 raman qep . starting with the charge / orbital scenario ( scenario a ) </S>",
    "<S> , the bare static nematic susceptibility @xmath69 and @xmath70 are directly connected by a kramers - kronig transformation @xmath71 @xcite , corresponding to the qep area @xmath72 in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> an attemped scaling of @xmath69 obtained in this way and the polycrystalline shear modulus @xmath73 extracted from ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath74(300 k)@xmath75 @xcite , is given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ shear ] , where @xmath76 is a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between these two curves , interpreted under scenario a , indicate that the charge / orbital fluctuations do not drive the structural transition at @xmath5 , and an additional electronic nematic degree of freedom , presumably the magnetic one , is driving the phase transitions in lfao @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this reasoning closely follows that presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now explore the alternative scenario where spin nematic fluctuations dominate the intensity of the @xmath2 raman qep ( scenario b ) . in this case , the dynamical electronic nematic susceptibility is not given directly by @xmath70 , and therefore a kramers - kronig transformation does not apply to extract @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , @xmath77 is proportional to the slope of @xmath70 in the limit @xmath78 @xcite , namely the qep height @xmath79 . in this scenario , @xmath80 k , </S>",
    "<S> obtained from the fit of @xmath79 to a curie - weiss - like behavior @xmath81 over the interval @xmath82 ( solid line in fig . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ shear ] displays a scaling of the polycrystalline shear modulus to the peak height , @xmath74(300 k)@xmath83 , showing an excellent agreement . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , independently of the assumption on the detailed nature of the raman @xmath2 qep , we conclude that the nematic transition is magnetically driven .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal evolution of the relaxation rate @xmath84 provides further insight into the nematic transition . at @xmath85 one </S>",

    "<S> [ fluct](b ) , on the energy scale as the optical phonons ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phonons ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such relatively fast relaxation dynamics may not allow the formation of local orthorhombic domains associated with instantaneous nematic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> below @xmath67 , the nematic fluctuations slow down continuously on cooling ( see fig . [ fluct](b ) ) , likely signaling the formation of orthorhombic nano - domains associated with the nematic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath67 seems to coincide with the temperature below which ( i ) an additional contribution to the @xmath39 qep relaxation rate is observed ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fluct](b ) ) , ( ii ) the shear modulus have the steepest @xmath4dependence ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ shear ] and ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and ( iii ) the soft tetragonal - orthorhombic transition starts to be observed @xcite . on further cooling , at @xmath5 , the slower nematic fluctuations may finally allow for the formation of sufficiently stable orthorhombic domains that coalesce into a long - range orthorhombic phase . </S>",
    "<S> immediately below @xmath5 the magnetic fluctuations are slowed down further ( see fig . [ fluct](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely associated with changes in the @xmath88 and @xmath89 nearest - neighbor exchange integrals , partially releasing the magnetic frustration and allowing for increased magnetic correlation lengths @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> further inspection of our results gives insight into the large separation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 (  15 k ) compared to their near coincidence in bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at @xmath90 k , for instance , the maximum of @xmath91 , corresponding to the qep linewidth @xmath54 , is 43(2 ) cm@xmath26 for lfao ( see fig . </S>",
