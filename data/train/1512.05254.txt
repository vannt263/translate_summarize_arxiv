    "after the discovery of the first iron - based superconductors with laofeas in 2008 @xcite a large amount of new iron - based superconductors has been found . in spite of intensive investigations using a variety of techniques the superconducting pairing mechanism and the microscopic origin of the magnetism in iron - based superconductors is still under debate @xcite . nevertheless , combining different results accumulated so far",
    ", the knowledge about the physical properties of the iron pnictides has progressed .",
    "key properties in view of the determination of the pairing mechanism are the pairing symmetry and the investigation of bosonic excitations which probably act as the pairing - glue for the cooper - pair formation .",
    "the characteristic length scale of the cooper pairs is called the superconducting coherence length .",
    "in contrast to cuprates and conventional superconductors , the superconducting gap distribution in iron based superconductors is rather diversified @xcite .",
    "nodeless isotropic gap distributions have been observed in ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath0as@xmath0 , ba@xmath0fe@xmath3co@xmath2as@xmath0 , lifeas , nafe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath0 , fete@xmath1se@xmath2 @xcite whereas strong signatures of nodal superconducting gap have been reported by various experimental techniques in laofep @xcite , lifep @xcite , underdoped ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite , bafe@xmath3ru@xmath2as@xmath0 @xcite , kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite , fese @xcite and bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similar nodal gap structures were expected for other nodal compounds like the phosphorus - based iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the optimally doped compound srfe@xmath0(as@xmath5p@xmath6)@xmath0 evidence suggested nodal superconductivity by doing phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance ( @xmath7p - nmr ) , specific heat and london penetration depth measurements @xcite . within this paper , we present our results of scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) measurements on isovalently doped srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 confirming nodal superconductivity for the optimally doped ( x=0.35 ) and overdoped ( x=0.46 ) compound with a hint for @xmath8 pairing symmetry .",
    "while the undoped compounds have been investigated with stm @xcite , no stm / sts were performed so far on doped samples suffering from a possible doping inhomogeneity . here",
    ", stm provides a useful tool for investigation of the surface morphology and the superconducting gap by means of elastic tunneling .",
    "inelastic tunneling is a precise tool to reveal the underlying bosonic structure in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "we , here , apply inelastic tunneling to unconventional superconductors .",
    "since for the optimally doped compound - srfe@xmath0(as@xmath5p@xmath6)@xmath0 - the superconducting transition temperature @xmath9 is about @xcite , it is unlikely that phonons are the particles responsibe for the cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "hence , the investigation of other excitations which could act as pairing - glue is important .",
    "especially , for the investigation of doped samples stm is an appropriate method to address these samples due to its ability to spatially resolve the dos .",
    "this allows us to directly determine the coherence length in the superconducting compounds from measurements of the local dos as well .",
    "depending on the phosphorus concentration and temperature , srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 can either be in the magnetic phase , in the superconducting phase or in the normal conducting phase @xcite . in the present paper we investigated srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 by performing sts for four different doping concentrations . in the first part of the paper",
    "we show the results of the optimally doped ( x=0.35 ) and overdoped ( x=0.46 ) superconducting compound .",
    "the method for measuring the superconducting gap and the coherence length will be explained therein . in the second part ,",
    "possible inelastic excitations of these compounds are compared to those of the magnetic compound ( x=0.2 ) and the parent compound ( x=0 ) .",
    "the srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 single crystals were synthesized using the self flux method @xcite .",
    "all investigated crystals were cleaved at @xmath10{mbar}$ ] at @xmath11{k}$ ] and afterwards immediately transferred to the stm - chamber .",
    "cleavage posts were glued onto the samples using a triple - axis manipulator .",
    "measurements were done with a home - build joule thomson low temperature stm ( jt - stm ) @xcite at about @xmath12{k}$ ] .",
    "the jt - stm contains a magnet which allows to enter the shubnikov phase of srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 .",
    "topographic images for the four different compounds are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . due to covalent bonds between fe and as atoms the feas - layers are assumed to remain intact during the cleavage .",
    "in fact the cleavage occurs either between the as and sr layer or within the sr layer leaving half of the atoms of the sr - layer on the topmost layer forming a @xmath13 or @xmath14-reconstruction @xcite .        in our measurements ,",
    "a @xmath14-reconstruction was present for all samples .",
    "however , the samples with higher doping concentrations ( x=0.35 , 0.46 ) showed more defects and impurities coming from the higher phosphorus concentration . the tunneling spectra ( cf fig . [ fig2]a ) ) are spatially averaged over many spectra .",
    "the width of the superconducting gap @xmath15 was determined by the positions of the quasiparticle peaks which occur at @xmath16{mv}$ ] for the optimally doped compound and at @xmath17{mv}$ ] for the overdoped compound as indicated in the figure . even though they were measured at t=",
    "the superconducting gap is v - shaped and does not go completely down to zero at zero bias .",

    "whereas for the dark green line @xmath21 and the nodal line intercepts the electron - like fermi surfaces .",
    "blue dots mark the positions where the gap - size on the fermi surface is zero .",
    "adapted from @xcite ]    iron based superconductors , as well as the present system , obey a complicated fermi surface characterized by five sets of fermi sheets arising from the d - orbital of iron .",
    "two of them form electron like pockets at the m point , while the other three build up hole like pockets centered at the @xmath22 point @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig2]e ) ) .",
    "the different fermi surfaces give rise to different gap values , characteristic for multi - band superconductors .",
    "indeed , our optimally doped sample shows a double - gap like feature .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig2]b ) , where we observe not only one dip - peak pair but also two features inside the v - shaped gap .",
    "the dip and peak features closest to zero bias correspond to the largest slope of the superconducting dos shown in blue in fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "the peaks and dips , marked by arrows , correspond to local maxima of the slope of the superconducting dos ( blue line in fig.[fig2]a ) ) .",
    "further hints for multiple gap values have been obtained experimentally in angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies on ba122-k40 @xcite as well as in stm experiments on ba122-co6 @xcite , @xcite .    in fig . [",
    "fig2]e ) a simpler sketch of the fermi surface is illustrated only depicting one kind of electron and hole pockets , respectively .",
    "the electron and hole - like fermi surfaces are linked via scattering processes involving antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite . in conjunction of this scattering process , if it was the mechanism of cooper pair formation , an unconventional @xmath8-symmetry of the order parameter was proposed @xcite which exhibits different sign on the electron and hole pockets . in this extended model",
    "the order parameter @xmath23 can be described by two terms @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a vector in reciprocal space .",
    "the ratio of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 specifies which of them dominates resulting in a nodeless or nodal order parameter .",
    "the order parameter changes its sign on an almost circular nodal line centered around the @xmath22 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]e ) ) .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath28 , the nodal line of the full function @xmath29 may or may not pass through the electron - like fermi surfaces @xcite . if it passes the fermi surface a nodal order parameter occurs . from the experimental side the @xmath30-symmetry of the order parameter",
    "is supported by stm experiments exploiting qpi in connection with an additional magnetic field in fe(se , te ) @xcite .",
    "if the order parameter vanishes at some points on the fermi surface , the quasiparticle density of states , which is averaged over all momenta , is thus not fully gapped anymore and a v - shape gap emerges .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] prove , that the system srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 possesses a nodal superconducting gap , suggesting @xmath8-symmetry in this system . while the d - symmetry always induces a nodal gap due to symmetry in cuprates , in the pnictides the appearance of a v - shaped gap depends on the details of the compound under investigation .",
    "this effect was already observed experimentally in the comparison of tunneling spectra of fete@xmath31se@xmath32 which are fully gapped @xcite and fese , where a v - shaped gap was observed @xcite .",
    "next , we determined the coherence length of the optimally and overdoped compounds by using two different methods for both of them . on one hand we applied the power spectral density function ( psdf ) on a measured superconducting gap map and on the other hand we applied a magnetic field to extract the coherence length from a vortex .",
    "first we describe the psdf - method .      due to the random phosphorus doping",
    ", inhomogeneities within the sample lead to spatial variations of the superconducting gap on the minimal length scale set by the coherence length .",
    "thinking about conventional superconductors , the superconducting ground state occurs due to a large number of overlapping cooper - pair wavefunctions where the phase of the cooper - pair is the same as the one of the superconducting ground state . for srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0",
    "we assume that the spatial variation of doping concentration is convoluted with the wavefunction of the cooper - pairs of the extension of the coherence length @xmath33 .",
    "the wavefunction of a cooper - pair can be described by a gaussian function @xmath34 . in order to extract @xmath35",
    "we did spatially resolved sts measurements over an area of @xmath36{nm}\\times \\unit[30]{nm}^2 $ ] with @xmath37 spectra . for each spectrum",
    "the gap area was evaluated using the trapezoidal rule .",

    "bright areas correspond to large values for the superconducting gap area and hence to a pronounced superconducting behaviour .",
    "in contrast , in the darker areas the superconductivity is suppressed . on these images we applied the radial resolved psdf , where the psdf is the square of the absolute value of the fourier transformation of a function ( psdf@xmath39)@xcite .",
    "we can calculate the coherence length assuming such an image consists of randomly distributed superconducting areas convoluted with a gaussian distribution g(x , y ) @xmath40 using the relationship @xmath41 the coherence length can be extracted from @xmath42 as shown in fig.[wulfhekel1_f2]b ) and [ wulfhekel1_f2]d ) . by averaging several measurements in different regions on the surface for the optimally doped compound as well as for the overdoped compound we obtain for the in - plane superconducting coherence length a value of @xmath43{nm}$ ] for the optimally doped compound and @xmath44{nm}$ ] for the overdoped compound . in order to verify these results we additionally determined the coherence length by using a second method which we call the vortex - method .      by applying a magnetic field of 1 t ,",

    "the vortex - lattice could be resolved in @xmath45-maps . for this",
    ", we set the bias voltage to and respectively for the optimally doped and overdoped compound .",
    "these bias voltages correspond to the largest slope of the superconducting dos in the optimally / overdoped compound , visible as peaks in the second derivative of the tunneling current .",
    "recording @xmath45-maps at this bias voltages allows us to distinguish superconducting and normal conducting areas .",

    "it is possible to extract the coherence length by fitting the measured data with a function @xmath51 since the dos is related to @xmath52 . in order to be consistent with the psdf - method",
    ", we again evaluated the superconducting gap area , but now , within the vortex method , we did the procedure for each point along a line through the vortex ( see lower right of fig.[wulfhekelf1_f3 ] b ) and d ) ) .",

    "the agreement to the psdf - method is rather good in the case of the optimally doped compound . nevertheless , the psdf - method is more accurate as it contains information of a higher number of local spectra .",
    "the vortex method requires to measure along a line through the vortex , which should not move during the measurement .",
    "especially for the optimally doped compound the vortices were mobile even during scanning and were not well - pinned as can also be seen in the vortex lattice in fig.[wulfhekelf1_f3]a ) .    finally , a theoretical estimation for the coherence length can be made by using the well established relation @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigated srfe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 single crystals with four different phosphorus concentrations x in the superconducting phase ( x = 0.35 , 0.46 ) and in the magnetic phase ( x = 0 , 0.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting samples display a v - shaped superconducting gap , which suggests nodal superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we determined the superconducting coherence length by measuring the spatially resolved superconducting density of states ( dos ) . using inelastic tunneling spectroscopy we investigated excitations in the samples with four different phosphorus concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic peaks are related to bosonic modes . </S>",
    "<S> phonon and non - phonon mechanism for the origin of these peaks are discussed . </S>"
