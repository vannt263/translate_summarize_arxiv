    "much attention has been devoted to materials where structural effects deeply influence the electronic phenomena , as , for instance , v@xmath3cr@xmath4o@xmath5,@xcite polyacetilene,@xcite displacive - type ferroelectrics,@xcite the manganites exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite and the high temperature superconducting perovskites.@xcite from the theoretical standpoint , such effects have been studied by adding various kinds of electron - phonon couplings to different electronic hamiltonians , mainly of the extended hubbard or @xmath6@xmath7 type .",
    "however , comparatively little attention has been paid to the effect of the structure ( in its simplest form , a variation of the lattice spacing @xmath0 ) onto the electronic interactions themselves .",
    "such effects are of great relevance in experiments : consider , for example , the measurements under either external or chemical pressure , and the wealth of interesting phenomena that they have revealed .",
    "the electronic interaction parameters can be written as integrals of various combinations of wannier functions centered on the lattice sites ( as will be detailed in section [ sec : model ] below ) .",
    "therefore , a change of @xmath0 is expected to have a non - negligible effect on them . in the realm of electronic transitions , to our knowledge , after a pioneering attempt by kawabata@xcite , only spaek and wjcik@xcite focused onto such effects .",
    "they argued that , in a system of fermions undergoing a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) due to the on - site repulsion effect , the wave functions may significantly change their shape across the transition , concomitantly to a change of the equilibrium lattice spacing .",
    "therefore , different values for the hopping amplitude @xmath8 and the on - site repulsion @xmath9 may correspond to the itinerant and the localized regimes . in the present work we explore the consequences of such an approach in systems with a holstein - type electron - phonon interaction .",
    "our model hamiltonian includes all the electronic interaction parameters for one- and two - body terms , whose dependence on @xmath0 results from their evaluation in terms of wannier functions built from gaussian orbitals .",
    "we also consider the characteristic structural length @xmath0 as free to vary between reasonable boundaries , in order to model the effects of the experimental techniques that allow for a more or less continuous tuning of the bond length .",
    "we find that both the electronic and phononic states significantly depend on @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , on one side , the phonon state , characterized by the extent of the _ displacement _ and the _ squeezing _ , reflects the electronic transitions at a deeper level than just a frequency renormalization . on the other side , as the optimal shape of the wannier wave functions depends not only on @xmath0 , but also on the phonon state , the renormalization of the electronic parameters by the phonons is actually more complex than indicated by the standard results of the polaronic model.@xcite    to put into evidence the basic features of our approach , avoiding unnecessary complications , our model system in the present paper is a simple dimer with a single orbital per site .",
    "it can be considered as the basic unit to build clusters and lattices , and its simplicity allows for a full control on the analytic aspects of the calculations .",
    "also , some unavoidable approximations which have to be introduced are linked to the physics , and not to the complications of treating larger systems .",
    "some new aspects distinguish the present work from the rich existing literature on the holstein dimer with various types of inter - electronic interactions , ( see , for instance , refs .",
    ", and the literature cited therein ) .",
    "first , the effective electronic hamiltonian originates from a first - principles hamiltonian including the complete set of one- and two - body electronic terms consistent with a single orbital per site . to the best of our knowledge , previous studies considered only a more restricted subset of interactions .",
    "second , we present our results mainly by setting the values of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath2 and phonon energy @xmath10 and taking the dimer length @xmath0 as the continuously varying controlling parameter .",
    "the dependence of the state of the system on its length usually receives little attention even though it is much more easily accessible experimentally than the dependence on the strength of the coupling , which requires delicate chemical manipulations .",
    "however , some discussion of the case of fixed length and varying coupling will also be given .",
    "we will discuss the cases of quarter- and half - filling of the electron orbitals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : model ] presents the model hamiltonian and the expressions of the electronic interactions explicitly depending on the dimer length . in section [ sec : heff ] the effective electronic hamiltonian is obtained , while in section [ sec : cf ] several correlation functions and other quantities of experimental interest are explicitly evaluated .",
    "the results of the numerical analysis of our model are presented and commented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , some general conclusions are presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",

    "we would like to remark that the existence of this region of the phase diagram ( probably the most interesting one as far as high-@xmath147 superconductors are concerned ) depends strongly on the squeezing of the phonon states , as can be seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gam_del_alph_n2 ] . in other words ,",
    "the squeezing effect counteracts the oscillator displacement , and succeeds in preserving a rather itinerant character even in the presence of both appreciable charge transfer and magnetic correlations .",
    "we have presented here a variational study of a dimer where interacting electrons occupy a single orbital per site and are coupled to holstein phonons . we have put into evidence that the variation of the dimer length and/or the strength of the electron - phonon coupling yield a strong renormalization of the interaction constants as well as the width of the wannier functions describing the local orbitals , which establishes a link between the electronic interactions and the phonons at a deeper level than predicted by the standard polaron approach .",
    "the squeezing of the phonon states has been shown to be particularly relevant , yielding sharp changes in the state of the system as the dimer length is varied at fixed electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the experimental interest of this finding is that situations where the interatomic distances can be varied , even by a small amount , either uniformly by an external pressure , or inhomogeneously by dimerization in a chain compound , can lead to important changes in the system s behavior .",
    "obviously one has to be careful in making predictions about the behavior of an extended system based on calculations for a two - site cluster .",
    "nevertheless , despite the fact that figs.[fig : phasediag_n1 ] and [ fig : phasediag_n2 ] can not be viewed as _ phase diagrams _ , we believe that they allow us to speculate on the nature of the corresponding states in a lattice .",
    "remaining in the half - filled case , the region where the extended bonding singlet is stable should show the antiferromagnetic order characteristic of the usual hubbard model , with a continuous evolution towards a local - moment paramagnet as the interatomic distance is increased . for a doped system , one could expect the two - site singlets to build up a rvb - like state , or an inter - site bipolaron , in the lattice . on the other hand , the @xmath132 state should correspond to a charge density wave in the lattice . in connection to the htsc materials , our most significant",
    "finding is that there is a region in the parameter space where the kinetic energy , the charge transfer and the magnetic correlations are simultaneously large , while the phonon state is partially displaced and strongly squeezed .",
    "this result suggests that it is perhaps not necessary to set a sharp alternative between either magnetic or charge instabilities .",
    "based on our results , one might speculate that , in the normal state , those materials might be in a situation corresponding to the one in the dimer , where both types of fluctuations can be simultaneously large .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the existence of this narrow region ( between the dashed and continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag_n2 ] ) in our model is entirely due to the squeezing of the phonon states .",
    "indeed , we checked that it disappears if one keeps the squeezing - parameter @xmath81 fixed at zero , giving rise to a direct transition from the extended singlet ground - state ( @xmath148 ) to the charge transfer one ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "we thus suggest that the competition between magnetic and charge instabilities in htsc materials might be driven by electron - phonon interactions in the presence of strongly squeezed phonon states",
    ". it would be interesting to use the dimer solutions obtained here as building blocks for lattice states , with the aim of obtaining quantitative support for our qualitative analysis of the lattice case .",
    "work on this line is now in progress .",
