    "the mott metal insulator transition ( mit ) has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies over the past decades.@xcite among correlated materials where the coulomb repulsion between electrons is strong enough to overcome their kinetic energy , we find many @xmath2 transition - metal oxides ( see ref .  ) and alkali - doped fullerides.@xcite the influence of orbital degeneracy on the properties of strongly correlated electronic systems has been the subject of numerous recent studies .",
    "it has been shown unambiguously that the orbital degrees of freedom are of primary importance for understanding the nature of the mott mit.@xcite more recently , the interesting and controversial possibility of an orbital selective mit in a multiorbital system has been investigated.@xcite hund s coupling plays an important role in these systems but reliable dynamical quantities are not available for a spin and orbital rotational invariant hund s coupling . very recently",
    "a new approach using an extension of wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) has been proposed.@xcite the exchange part of the hund s coupling influences dramatically the physics of the two - band hubbard model and changes the nature of the mott transition .    in the present paper",
    ", we introduce into the triply degenerate orbital model a non zero hund s coupling parameter @xmath1 and we take into account its full expression including the so - called spin - flip term .",
    "the only neglected term is the orbital flip contribution or pair - hopping term between different orbitals.@xcite    even the simplest lattice model for correlated electrons , the one - band hubbard model presents strong difficulties and approximations are necessary to solve it .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite provides a solution in the limit of large spatial dimension.@xcite within the dmft framework , a correct description of the mott - hubbard metal insulator transition is possible for the one - band hubbard model.@xcite    in a previous work we have proposed an approach based on the dmft which was able to deal with the doubly degenerate hubbard model@xcite with a vanishing hund s coupling .",
    "metal insulator transitions for integer total occupations per site @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were observed , with different values for the critical parameters on the transition lines . besides",
    ", the transfer of spectral weight between different bands was interpreted in terms of microscopic dynamical processes . here , in order to give a more realistic description of the spectral function of a correlated metal with several orbital degrees of freedom close to the mit , we propose a generalization of our previous approach .",
    "also , we develop a systematic description of the effects of degeneracy , of the hubbard interaction and the hund s coupling on the triply degenerate model .",
    "the triply degenerate model is relevant for transition - metal oxides or other transition - metal compounds where the cubic crystal field splits the 3@xmath6 level into the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 manifolds whenever it is the @xmath8 manifold which is partially occupied .",
    "an example is vo@xmath9 ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "it shows a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior for @xmath10 close to 1 and the v@xmath11 ion provides three electrons to the @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "in that special case , however , not only correlation but also disorder effects seem to be very important , even for the stoichiometric samples .",
    "other examples are the heavy fermion compound liv@xmath12o@xmath13 which remains metallic up to very low temperature@xcite and liti@xmath12o@xmath13 which is superconducting below @xmath14  k.@xcite our approach is also relevant for mgti@xmath12o@xmath13 ( see ref .   and references therein ) which is metallic above @xmath15  k.    in our study we investigate the @xmath8-derived spectral function .",
    "we find three different effects in the spectral function : ( i ) band effects ( which are usually already well described by the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) ) , ( ii ) the hubbard satellites ( at an energy scale of @xmath16 , already well treated by dmft of the one - band model ) , and ( iii ) multi - peak effects connected with the hund s coupling ( energy scale @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is the last aspect which is new in our approach in comparison to previous studies .",
    "keeping in mind that these multi - peak effects should be important to interpret realistic spectra , we analyze nevertheless a model situation in the present work with a semi - elliptic density of states for the uncorrelated problem .    in the following section the model hamiltonian is presented , it takes into account explicitly the effect of hund s coupling .",
    "this section also presents the application of the dmft on this hamiltonian and a method of resolution based on the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) . in the third section",
    ", the main results concerning spectral properties are discussed .",
    "the triply degenerate hubbard hamiltonian , including a non zero hund s coupling parameter @xmath1 can be written ( see for instance ref .  )",
    "as follows  : @xmath17 the sum @xmath18 runs over nearest neighbor sites of a bethe lattice and @xmath19 are the band indices .",
    "@xmath20 ( respectively @xmath21 ) denotes the creation ( respectively annihilation ) operator of an electron at the lattice site @xmath22 with spin @xmath23 and orbital index @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the occupation number operator for spin @xmath23 and orbital @xmath24 . the hopping between different orbitals",
    "will not be investigated here since @xmath26 . the ref .",
    "presents a general hamiltonian for the multi orbital hubbard model .",
    "the only term neglected in our approach is the pair - hopping term between different orbitals .",
    "the prefactors in eq .",
    "(  [ hamiltonien ] ) ensure the hamiltonian is invariant under any linear combination of the @xmath8 orbitals .    within the framework of the dmft , by integrating out all fermionic degrees of freedom except those for a central site @xmath27",
    ", the lattice model  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) can be mapped onto an effective impurity model .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath28 contains a local part @xmath29 and a part corresponding to the coupling to the effective medium that has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "we then write  : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the coupling with the effective medium is @xmath32 @xmath33 represents the hybridization between the site @xmath27 and the effective medium corresponding to orbital @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath34 is the band energy of the same effective medium .",
    "@xmath35 ( respectively @xmath36 ) is the creation ( respectively annihilation ) operator of an electron in the effective medium @xmath24 . as in",
    "the doubly degenerate situation,@xcite the effective medium is a multi - component one that can be characterized by the effective dynamical hybridizations  : @xmath37 by writing the equation of motion of the hamiltonian @xmath28 we obtain  : @xmath38 besides , on a bethe lattice , the green s function presents the following property @xmath39 therefore , the self - consistent equations of the dmft can be simply written like @xmath40 the local problem that has to be solved self - consistently is then formally similar to the doubly degenerate case previously investigated .",
    "however we have to deal here with a large number @xmath41 of local impurity states @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) of orbital @xmath24 at the impurity site @xmath44",
    ". indeed , the third orbital @xmath45 increases @xmath41 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "another difficulty comes from the spin - flip term  : due to this term , the basis of local states @xmath48 does no longer diagonalize @xmath29 .    in",
    "the following , the @xmath0 states that diagonalize @xmath29 will be noted @xmath49 .",
    "they form the basis @xmath50 . taking into account",
    "the degeneracy of local states @xmath49 , it is possible to decrease the basis dimension to @xmath51 , the corresponding states will be noted @xmath52 .",
    "indeed the @xmath0 states can be classified in @xmath53 generic families ( third column in table  [ restricted_states ] ) .",
    "the @xmath54 family contains @xmath55 local states @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath56 indicates the number of different energies corresponding to this family .",
    "the @xmath54 family will be therefore represented by @xmath56 states @xmath52 .",
    "we thus have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "( for details , see table  [ restricted_states ] ) .",
    ".for each family , labels of different local states are given in column @xmath59 .",
    "column @xmath60 displays the generic form of local state  : it stands for @xmath55 states corresponding to @xmath61 or @xmath62 , and permutation of orbitals .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath52 are defined in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath29 is diagonal in the basis @xmath63 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 can therefore be solved by using the extended version of the non - crossing approximation presented in a previous work.@xcite this approach has been used with success for various problems.@xcite    within nca , propagators and self - energies for the @xmath0 local states @xmath49 are introduced . these propagators ( and self - energies ) are identical for similar local states .",
    "for instance @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are described by the same propagator @xmath67 because of orbital and spin degeneracy .",
    "we have then only @xmath51 different propagators @xmath68 .",
    "however , all the @xmath0 local states are needed to express the @xmath69 and the @xmath70 operators by hubbard operators @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , we can write @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a @xmath74 matrix and @xmath75 is a @xmath76 matrix .",
    "@xmath73 is calculated by developping the annihilation operator onto hubbard operators and @xmath75 can be deduced by using the previously discussed degeneracy for local propagators @xmath68 .    in the next section we present our results for the triply orbital degenerate hubbard model .",
    "the density of states is obtained by solving the effective dmft model by application of the nca .",
    "in this section , we present the calculated densities of states for the triply orbital degenerate hubbard model with a hund s exchange invariant under spin rotation .",
    "the dmft results are obtained for @xmath77  ev , @xmath16 from @xmath59 to @xmath78  ev and for finite temperature @xmath79  k. we will take @xmath80 or @xmath81 .    in order to understand the specific role played by hund s coupling , and the nature of the different bands composing the density of states , we firstly investigate in the following sub - section the @xmath82 situation .",
    "the non vanishing @xmath1 system will be studied in section  [ full_hund_section ] .      because of the triple band degeneracy , the electronic excitation spectra present already a rich structure for @xmath82 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ allplots ] , where various concentrations of charge carriers are investigated from @xmath83 up to @xmath84 .",
    "in this triply degenerate system , six electrons can in principle coexist at each site . for some plots ( labelled by a star in the figure ) , the fermi level position is indicated by a small circle .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous works on the mit for degenerate correlated systems . in the strongly correlated regime , we find an insulating state for each integer filling . for fillings close to integer values , the narrow quasiparticle structure at the fermi level is characteristic for a strongly correlated metal . with increasing chemical potential , an important transfer of spectral weight",
    ". the relative band spectral weights can be interpreted in terms of probabilities .",
    "for instance , for @xmath83 the excitation spectrum is mainly composed of two bands corresponding to the lower and the upper hubbard bands ( lhb and uhb ) .",
    "the number of occupied electronic states of the lhb gives the probability of removing an electron from the system , like in a photoemission experiment .",
    "the spectral weight of the uhb gives the probability of adding an electron in an empty state ( inverse photoemission ) .",
    "for @xmath85 close to @xmath86 there is only one possibility for removing an electron , but there are five possibilities of adding an electron onto the same site .",
    "this is indicated in figure  [ allplots ] for various densities  : @xmath87 , @xmath88  for @xmath82 , the additional energy involved in this process is @xmath16 , whatever the spin of the electron and the occupied orbital are .",
    "to @xmath89 for the triply degenerate hubbard model without hund s coupling and for @xmath90  ev . for some fillings ( labelled by a star ) , the fermi level is indicated by a small circle.,width=302 ]    densities of states for @xmath91 and @xmath92 are displayed in figure  [ allplots_ef ] with an energy shift ensuring that all fermi energies are at the same point . here",
    ", the transfer of spectral weight from the lhb to the uhb is obvious .",
    "the inset shows the low energy behavior .",
    "we do not consider exactly integer values for @xmath85 to prevent numerical problems when the density of states at the fermi level is very close to zero .",
    "nevertheless , our approach is numerically well defined for filling arbitrary close to integer values , with increasing numerical efforts .",
    "for all fillings , a quasiparticle peak is clearly present , but the effective mass of these quasiparticles is strongly dependent on the number of charge carriers .",
    "the correlated system with @xmath93 is much closer to the insulating state than the @xmath94 situation .",
    "the @xmath83 effective mass can be obtained from the self - energy via @xmath95 and is approximately seven times the @xmath96 effective mass . actually ,",
    "because of electron - hole symmetry , @xmath97 and @xmath94 give symmetric densities of states and therefore the same effective masses for quasiparticles .",
    "consequently , starting from @xmath98 , a @xmath99 electron or hole doping leads to very different systems contrasting with the one band hubbard model .",
    "ev and the fermi level corresponds to the origin of the graph .",
    "the inset shows the low energy behavior.,width=302 ]    for @xmath82 , we obtained a mott metal insulator transition for each integer filling @xmath100 .",
    "this is consistent with previous theoretical works using slave - boson formalism,@xcite variational method@xcite and quantum monte - carlo dynamical mean field theory.@xcite nevertheless , the interesting question of the order of the transition can not be investigated by the present approach because of the nca pathology at low temperature.@xcite indeed , the coexistence region extending to finite doping off half - filing observed for the doubly degenerate hubbard model has been observed only at low temperature.@xcite      keeping a spin - rotational invariant hund s exchange means that we have to handle explicitly the last term in expression  ( [ hamiltonien ] ) .",
    "recently , a very accurate study showing the importance of this term has been presented for the two - band hubbard model.@xcite indeed , a completely different behavior occurs if one replaces the rotationally invariant hund exchange by an ising - like one .    here",
    "we will focus on the specific effects of the hund s exchange coupling on the electron dynamics for the strongly correlated metal and for the integer filling system which is insulating for large @xmath16 .",
    "we will see that @xmath85 plays a crucial role .",
    "( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath101 and ( c ) @xmath102 .",

    "they correspond to strongly correlated metals close to the insulating state .",
    "the narrow quasi - particle peak at the fermi level is a signature of the large electronic effective mass close to the mit . for each @xmath85 and for @xmath90",
    "ev , the calculation has been done for three values of hund s parameter @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath103 .",
    "the ( a ) part of the figure shows that , for @xmath83 , the effect of a finite @xmath1 value is restricted to high energy structures of the spectrum .",
    "this can be understood by considering the energies of the local states listed in table  [ tab_energies ] . for @xmath83 , local states playing an important role in the electronic dynamics",
    "are those with occupations @xmath104 , @xmath86 and @xmath59 .",
    "larger occupations of local states are highly unlikely .",
    "the only @xmath1-dependent local energies are those for the two - fermion states @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "transitions from singly occupied state to these states involve high energy excitations of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath1 influence restricted to high energy bands is specific to the singly occupied multi - band hubbard model .",
    "indeed , the physical situation is dramatically different for @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( part ( b ) and part ( c ) of figure  [ u6n_dop ] ) . here",
    ", a non zero @xmath1 has a strong influence on high energy excitations as well as close to the fermi level . for low energy excitations an important reduction of the spectral weight is observed .",
    "this is clearly visible in the figure insets and is in agreement with very recent results at half filling for the doubly degenerate hubbard model with hund s exchange.@xcite here , we found that this effect is also observed away from half filling . besides , this reduction is accompanied by the emergence of a multi - peak structure around the fermi level corresponding to the lifting of degeneracy of multiparticle states in table  [ tab_energies ] .",
    "this multi - peak effect is stronger for @xmath102 which is consistent with the energy interval @xmath109 between the three - fermion local states of spin @xmath110 and @xmath111 . if we approach @xmath5 , the peak at around @xmath109 diminishes such that we are left with a gap of the order of @xmath16 at @xmath5 .",

    "the stability of the metallic state is ensured by the intermediate value @xmath112  ev which is smaller than the critical @xmath113 of the mit for different integer fillings .",
    "@xmath1 takes values @xmath104 and @xmath103 . here",
    "again , the effect of a non zero @xmath1 is very weak for @xmath3 ( part ( a ) ) and restricted to high energy excitations .",
    "a completely different behavior occurs for @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for @xmath4 ( part ( b ) ) ,",
    "the introduction of a non vanishing @xmath114 is sufficient to destroy the quasiparticle coherent peak , which is consistent with the nrg results for the two - orbital hubbard model.@xcite this effect becomes stronger for the @xmath5 situation where a pseudo - gap is observed .",
    "such a structure with a pseudo - gap at the fermi energy is already present at half filling in the solution for the local impurity model proposed in ref .  .",
    "here we show that this critical role of @xmath1 , leading to a pseudo - gap appearance , can be observed away from half filling but the critical coulomb and hund parameters are strongly dependent on @xmath85 .",
    "this property has important consequences on the nature of the different mit in degenerate systems .",
    "a multi - band hubbard model displays a mott transition at all integer fillings .",
    "nevertheless , by taking into account the hund s exchange term , the different mit present different low energy dynamical behavior .",
    "it has been shown in previous studies that the critical correlation strengths @xmath113 depend on @xmath85 .",
    "for instance , for a multi - orbital hubbard model without hund s coupling and for a flat density of states , s. florens and a. georges@xcite found that @xmath113 is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "the maximum critical coupling @xmath116 for three orbitals is obtained for @xmath5 , the half - filled situation , where orbital fluctuations are largest .",
    "this result is consistent with previous work , in particular m.j .",
    "rozenberg@xcite has found that @xmath117 for the doubly degenerate orbital ( with @xmath82 ) hubbard model by using quantum monte - carlo calculations .    concerning the influence of the hund s coupling @xmath1 on the mott transition at @xmath118 ,",
    "an interesting generalization of the linearized dynamical mean field theory has been proposed recently.@xcite in addition to a reduction of @xmath113 due to @xmath1 , a qualitative change in the nature of the @xmath118 mott transition has been observed for any finite @xmath1 .",

    "this impurity problem consists in a triply degenerate local correlated site ( @xmath0 local states ) embedded in an uncorrelated conduction band which is orbital dependent .",
    "as expected , for @xmath82 , we obtained a mott metal insulator transition for each integer filling namely @xmath100 .",
    "the influence of a hund s exchange invariant under spin rotation has been studied in detail . in agreement with previous works",

    "these effects give rise to structures with an energy scale @xmath1 .",
    "an important result of our approach is the very strong dependence of all these effects on the filling .",
    "the destruction of low energy states is much more pronounced at half filling than at other fillings . besides , for @xmath3 , this effect is not visible .",
    "another interesting point is the occurrence of a particular value @xmath124 for which the reduction is maximum , @xmath124 increasing with @xmath16 .",
    "it could be interesting to include in the present model different bandwidths for different orbitals to investigate the role of hund s exchange in the so - called _ orbital selective mott transition_.@xcite another possible perspective for this work is to understand how disorder in real materials can affect the presented results concerning hund s exchange influence . finally , the pair hopping term between different orbitals ( orbital - flip term ) can be studied in the framework of our approach and will be the subject of a forthcoming publication , as well as a more specific treatment of realistic spectra .",
