    "as each star evolves , its planetary system evolves as well , through a combination of stellar expansion , mass loss , and dynamical interactions . in spite of the fact that the first planet to be discovered orbits a pulsar ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ) , we still know little about the planetary systems around stellar remnants . fortunately , a variety of methods are poised to change this .",
    "pulsar timing studies in combination with hst images have found a planet in a circumbinary orbit around a binary consisting of a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf ( sigurdsson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "timing measurements of pulsating compact stars can also identify candidate planetary systems around highly evolved stars ( i.e. silvotti et al .",

    "observations able to detect or place limits on possible planetary companions of white dwarfs ( mullally et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we point out that the _ kepler _ mission has the sensitivity and cadence needed to detect transits of white dwarfs by asteroids .",
    "calculations show that asteroid or cometary systems can survive stellar evolution ( alcock et al . 1986 ) .",
    "while asymmetries in the mass loss can influence survivability , some white dwarfs could experience asteroid impacts at a rate of @xmath0  yr@xmath1 ( parriott and alcock 1998 ) .",
    "several independent lines of evidence suggest that some white dwarf stars do host circumstellar material ranging from dust to asteroids and planets ( howell et al .",

    "asteroid - sized objects , with diameters ranging from several tens of kilometers up to and including dwarf planets , are the primary focus of this paper .",
    "their instantaneous orbital distance from the white dwarf ranges from the tidal limit out to the equivalent of the sun s oort cloud .",
    "we will also consider the possible effects of rings and moons orbiting planets in white - dwarf systems .",
    "white dwarfs with infrared excesses have been studied by a number of groups .",
    "a common conclusion is that circumstellar dust is present .",
    "these white dwarfs tend to exhibit unusually strong metal lines in their photospheres ( von hippel et al .",
    "2007 ) , perhaps showing the signs of enrichment by recent accretion of material from an asteroid .",
    "indirect evidence of planetary material around warmer white dwarfs includes several stars that show metal lines in their photospheric spectrum ( zuckerman et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) . in white dwarfs",
    ", metals sink below the photospheres on extremely short time scales ( of order days ) , so the presence of elements such as calcium argues that the stars have recently accreted metal - rich material .    as an example of possible asteroidal material surrounding a white dwarf , consider the recent work by gansicke et al .",
    "they report observations of caii and feii double - peaked emission lines , interpreted to be from a circumstellar , metal - rich gaseous disk .",
    "the white dwarf itself is hot enough ( @xmath2 ) to burn off dust from the disk , accounting for the lack of an infrared excess .",
    "the disk itself is the likely remnant of a tidally disrupted rocky body of asteroid - sized mass ( gansicke et al .",
    "the case for a metal - rich disk is strengthened by observations of mgii absorption lines in the stellar spectrum .",

    "they conclude that an asteroid - mass object ( either a remnant asteroid or the residual of a disrupted terrestrial planet ) is needed to explain the abundance pattern .",
    "a very rough estimate of the size of an object needed to account for the metals seen in that star ( @xmath5  g ) is of order @xmath6  km ; such an object would produce a transit with a depth of @xmath7 , or @xmath8  ppm .      for every asteroid that is tidally",
    "disrupted , there must be many more with perihelia located much farther from the white dwarf .",
    "direct detection of these asteroids is challenging .",
    "they have very little gravitational influence on their star and can not presently be detected through either doppler or ground - based photometric transit methods .",
    "transits of white dwarfs by large asteroids can , however , be detected by _",
    "kepler _ , a space mission designed to detect the transits of sun - like stars by earth - like planets .",
    "consider a white dwarf with a radius of @xmath9  km .",
    "an asteroid with a radius of @xmath8  km ( @xmath10 )  km will produce a fractional decrease in the amount of light received of 150  ppm ( 15,000  ppm ) , within kepler s detection limit .",
    "many such asteroids of this size are known in our own solar system [ an estimated @xmath11 in the kuiper belt alone ( trujillo , jewett , & luu 2001 ) ] , so it is reasonable to expect that they exist elsewhere as well .    in ",
    "2 we show that the _ kepler _ observatory can discover asteroids orbiting white dwarfs by identifying short - lived downward deviations from the baseline flux in white dwarfs associated with transits by asteroids . in   3",
    "we discuss what we can learn through _ kepler _ monitoring of a small set of white dwarfs .",
    "asteroid transits or significant limits on white - dwarf asteroid systems are a certain science return .",
    "in addition , depending on the structure of white - dwarf planetary systems , transits by rings and/or moons may also be detected by monitoring a modest number of white dwarfs .",
    "the depth of a transit and its time duration determine its level of detectability .",
    "if @xmath12 is the projected area of the asteroid , and @xmath13 the cross - sectional area of the white dwarf , the depth of the transit is @xmath14 the calculations for asteroids transiting white dwarfs mirror the results for an earth - like planet transiting a sun - like star , because the relative size scales are similar . for an asteroid of a given size ,",
    "the depth is greatest for more massive white dwarfs , which are smaller .",
    "asteroid transits against a white dwarf will be of short duration and may have distinctive profiles . the time required for the asteroid s center of mass to cross",
    "the diameter of the white dwarf is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is approximately equal to the orbital velocity .. @xmath17 because the orbital speed , @xmath18 decreases with increasing @xmath19 , an asteroid of fixed size produces a longer event when it is farther from the white dwarf . the crossing time is larger for less massive white dwarfs because the orbital speed is smaller ( for a given @xmath19 ) and because the radius of a low - mass white dwarf is larger .",
    "the ingress and egress may be distinctive because many asteroids will not be massive enough to have been pulled into a spherical shape by self gravity .",
    "we have carried out a set of calculations to determine how large an asteroid must be in order for its transit against a white dwarf of given brightness to be detectable by _ kepler .",
    "_ we use the information on the _ kepler _ web pages to estimate the number of detected photoelectrons per minute : @xmath20  per  minute . for representative examples",
    ", we used the _ kepler _ magnitudes of @xmath21 relatively bright white dwarf candidates in the _ kepler _ field : @xmath22 for each candidate white dwarf we carried out two sets of calculations .",
    "in the first set , we assumed that the mass of the white dwarf was @xmath23 and used the corresponding radius . in the second set we used @xmath24 and decreased the value of @xmath25 accordingly .",
    "then , for each of @xmath26 values of the orbital separation @xmath19 , we computed the diameter of an asteroid for which we would have a @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 detection of the transit , by integrating over the crossing time .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 . for",
    "lower - mass white dwarfs , asteroids of smaller diameter can produce detectable transits .",
    "for the brightest white dwarf , transits of asteroids in the @xmath8-km class can be detected even when they are relatively close to the white dwarf .",
    "the dimmer the white dwarf , the farther from it must a @xmath8-km asteroid be in order for its transit to be detected by _ kepler .",
    "_ in the solar system , the kuiper belt extends from roughly @xmath30  au to @xmath31  au .",
    "large interlopers from the oort cloud , such as 2006 sq372 , are also found in this region , while the bulk of the oort cloud lies beyond @xmath10  au .",
    "although the white dwarf systems we target for _ kepler _ study may be very different , the example of the solar system indicates that it is good to be sensitive to asteroids at large values of @xmath19 .      the probability of detecting a transit by an individual asteroid is small , because it is proportional to the maximum angle of orbital inclination for which a transit can be observed : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radius of the white dwarf , @xmath34 is the radius of the asteroid , and @xmath19 is the orbital separation .",
    "if a typical value of @xmath35 is @xmath36  cm , and the average value of @xmath19 at the time of transit is @xmath37  au , then taking inclination alone into account , we would have to observe almost @xmath38 white dwarfs to have a good chance of detection .",
    "if each white dwarf is orbited by many asteroids , the probability of detection increases .",
    "should all of the asteroids orbit in a common plane , however , we must still monitor a large number of white dwarfs to have a good chance of detection .",
    "fortunately , our own solar system offers hope , and star and planet formation theory also suggest that planetary systems each host large numbers of asteroids and that the orbits are not aligned .",
    "the oort cloud ( @xmath39  au ) , which may have as much as @xmath8 earth masses ( marochnik et al . 1988 ) is expected to have a nearly spherical distribution .",
    "some of its members have perihelia within the kuiper belt ( @xmath40  au ) , while others could make even closer approaches .",
    "if each white dwarf we observe has a distributions of asteroids with the geometry of the oort cloud , we have a good chance to detect transits with _ kepler _ monitoring of even a single white dwarf .",
    "the kuiper belt itself has a scattered component in which the average orbital inclination angle , @xmath41 is @xmath42 while individual orbits can be even more inclined .",
    "( see sheppard 2006 and references therein . ) therefore , if the asteroid systems of white dwarfs have a geometry similar to that of the scattered kuiper belt , and if we could monitor @xmath43 white dwarfs , we would have a good chance that the equivalent of the scattered `` kuiper '' belt of one or more of them was inclined toward our line of sight",
    ".    assuming a spherical distribution , we can quantify the probability of detecting a transit as a function of @xmath19 as follows .",
    "we compute the number of asteroids that would have to have periastrons at a particular value of @xmath19 in order to have a probability near unity of detecting the transit . given @xmath44  cm , then for @xmath45  ( 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 100 )  au , the number of such asteroids is ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "these numbers assume that the interval @xmath50 during which continuous observations occur spans the orbital periods of the asteroids . in fact , @xmath50 will be longer than @xmath51 for small orbital apastrons , and the scaling above holds for those separations .",
    "even better , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 transits will be detected ; confidence that the photometric dips were caused by transits can therefore be high , just as multiple planetary transits enhance confidence in the discovery of planets . for wider separations , however , the probability is reduced by a factor @xmath54 for circular orbits , the number of asteroids needed to have a transit detection probability near unity is @xmath55 if @xmath56 for @xmath57 then the numbers of asteroids needed to ensure detection for @xmath45  ( 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 100 )  au are ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "these numbers are modest enough to suggest that , unless the white dwarf systems are depleted in @xmath8-km class asteroids relative to the solar system , _ kepler _ can discover asteroid transits by monitoring a handful of white dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , these numbers above are small enough that a null result would represent a meaningful limit .",
    "the characteristics of transit light curves are related to the properties of the asteroid . as if it is constant when a transit is not occurring .",
    "] if the ingress and egress can be resolved in time , there will be an interval @xmath60 during which the flux declines by @xmath61 , a second interval @xmath62 during which the flux remains at its steady minimum value @xmath63 , and a third interval @xmath64 during which the transit ends and the flux returns to the level , @xmath65 it would have had without the transit .",
    "it is important to note that , particularly for the bright white dwarfs likely to be monitored by _",
    "kepler , _ the white dwarf s radius and mass can be estimated to high accuracy using good quality optical spectra and model fits to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the depth of the transit ( the maximum downward deviation , @xmath61 ) , therefore measures the projected area of the asteroid .",
    "the value of @xmath62 combined with the estimated white dwarf s radius , provides an estimate of the asteroid s speed , hence its distance from the white dwarf .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath64 can not be measured , then we can use the time resolution of the observations to place upper limits on the linear dimensions of the asteroid .",
    "if they can be measured , then we can ( 1 ) determine the projected linear size of the asteroid at the time of ingress and ( 2 ) also at the time of egress .",
    "if they are different , then the asteroid may have been spinning ; we can ( 3 ) check for consistency to determine if a realistic spin period is consistent with the observed change .",
    "if they are the same , we can ( 4 ) determine if the shape of the light curve is consistent with a disk - like structure .",
    "using the area ( from the depth of the transit ) to estimate the possible mass , we can ( 5 ) check if we expect the asteroid to be spheroidal .",
    "finally , we can ( 6 ) check if the linear dimensions as estimated during ingress and egress are consistent with the projected area , as estimated from the depth of transit .",
    "note that if an event fails consistency checks , we can rule it out as a transit candidate . passing the checks",
    "does not however confirm the transit interpretation .",
    "when transit candidates are identified , an exhaustive analysis is required of any effects that could have produced a false positive signal . in an individual case ,",
    "if the asteroid orbit happens to not be highly eccentric and if @xmath19 is not much larger than an au , we may see a repeat during the lifetime of _ kepler ; _ this will confirm the transit model .",
    "overall , it is likely that an asteroid population large enough to produce a transit by one asteroid will produce transits by several independent asteroids , and that a set of self - consistent results will increase confidence in the transit interpretation .",
    "the nature of the results that can be obtained by _ kepler _ depends on the characteristics of planetary systems . because the progenitor of a white dwarf was a giant",
    ", it seems likely that the region within roughly an au was cleared of planets and asteroids .",
    "yet , the evidence sited in the introduction of this paper indicates that asteroids can and do approach close to white dwarfs .",
    "if the monitored white dwarfs have close - in asteroids with small semi - major axes , we will discover `` repeats''in a sense : multiple transits with similar characteristics .",
    "if the monitored white dwarfs have large asteroids , the photometric dips during transits will be highly significant .",
    "if the monitored white dwarfs have @xmath68 asteroids in a kuiper - like belt , several events caused by different asteroids will be observed .",
    "even if individual events are detected with low confidence ( e.g. , @xmath69 photometric dips ) , we may be able to derive significant results when several such are detected .",
    "this is because the probability of detecting multiple dips due to random processes ( which we can assess through observations of other stars ) is expected to be low .",
    "thus , multiple transits caused by one or by several asteroids , or deep transits , or long - lasting transits would provide information about some characteristics of the asteroid system .",
    "it is certainly possible , however , that for one or more white dwarfs , no highly significant events are discovered . in this case ,",
    "given the estimated efficiency , which will be well known based on _",
    "kepler s _ observations of hundreds of thousands of other stars , we can place quantitative limits on the presence of close - in , and/or large , and/or numerous asteroids around any given white dwarf .",
    "we therefore expect monitoring of each white dwarf to produce significant results of either a positive or negative nature .",
    "the _ kepler _ team is about to announce the first year s results .",
    "the mission is scheduled to take data for @xmath70  years , and could extend operations for a total duration of @xmath71  years .",
    "_ kepler _ can transmit data on approximately @xmath72 targets , most main - sequence stars which are being monitored in hope of detecting transits by earth - like planets .",
    "a limited number of data slots are available to monitor other targets suggested by the community .",
    "two modes of monitoring are available : @xmath30-minute cadence and @xmath37-minute cadence .",
    "equation  1 shows that the @xmath37-minute mode is needed to detect transits by close - in asteroids .",
    "although asteroids making close approaches to the white dwarf must be larger if their transits are to be detectable , it is important to be sensitive to close approaches for two reasons .",
    "first , the probability that the orientation is favorable scales as @xmath73 second , if the orbit is circular , the transits could be periodic , allowing for repeated transit observations .",
    "one - minute cadence is also important if we are to resolve the transit light curve for more distant approaches .",
    "the need for @xmath37-minute cadence limits the number of white dwarfs that can be monitored . in addition , only a small number of bright white dwarfs in the _ kepler _ field are known .",
    "fortunately , the large numbers of asteroids expected per white dwarf will almost certainly make it possible to discover asteroids by monitoring almost any white dwarf that has them .",
    "because planets are likely to form in a bottom - up approach , stellar formation seems likely to always produce small masses that will be gravitationally bound to the star , regardless of whether large planets form .",
    "even though stellar evolution is associated with mass loss from the system , a large number of asteroids should remain bound .",
    "in addition , the dynamical evolution of planetary orbits during stellar evolution seems likely to yield collisions and additional space debris in the form of asteroids .",
    "this line of argument is consistent with the data summarized in the introduction , which argues independently that asteroids orbit white dwarfs . nevertheless , some white dwarfs may be less likely to host asteroid systems , at least the ones associated with planet formation .",
    "consider , for example , a white dwarf that emerged from a common envelope episode .",
    "this suggests that the white dwarfs most suitable for the first monitoring program are those with masses near or above @xmath74 in addition , they should not have close stellar companions .",
    "if white - dwarf asteroid systems occupy a region similar to the solar system s scattered disk , then by monitoring a set of white dwarfs , we can sample a random distribution of possible orientations . if therefore , _ kepler _ can monitor ( for approximately one year each ) roughly a dozen bright white dwarfs",
    ", it should discover asteroids and begin to quantify the fraction of white dwarfs with asteroids in the @xmath8-km class .",
    "future projects that can take this study further are under consideration . since missions with _ kepler _",
    "s sensitivity can detect asteroids around white dwarfs , a more comprehensive all - sky survey monitoring @xmath75  stars ( such as that proposed for the transiting exoplanet survey satellite _ tess _ ) will be able to establish the statistics of asteroid systems around white dwarfs : the frequency as a function of white dwarf properties , and the distributions of asteroid sizes and orbital separations .",
    "white dwarfs may well be orbited by planets , but the probability @xmath76 that the orientation of a planetary orbit is favorable for the detection of a transit is small .",
    "@xmath77 this implies that thousands of white dwarfs would have to be monitored in order to discover transits by planets , which is not compatible with the primary goal of the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "nevertheless , other signatures of planets are more likely to be detected by _",
    "although planetary rings are generally composed of bits of debris that are individually too small to produce detectable transits , the combined effect can be to absorb and scatter enough light that the transit of the ring will be detectable ( e.g. , ohta , taruya , & suto 2009 and references therein ) . in this case , the ingress and egress profiles are likely to be symmetric and distinguishable from the patterns produced by an isolated mass",
    ". strategies for seacrhing for evidence of rings and moons in transit light curves have been developed ( barnes & fortney 2004 ; barnes 2004 ) .",
    "hst observations of the planetary transit of hd 189733 were able to dervie a convincing null result , ruling out the presence of rings or moons around around hd 189733b through a detailed light curve analysis ( pont et al .",
    "_ kepler _ could do the same , or else discover moons and rings around white dwarf planets , should they exist .    to compute the probability of detecting a transit by a ring",
    ", the term @xmath78 in equation  2 must be replaced by @xmath79 in this expression @xmath80 is the outer diameter of the ring system , and can be significantly larger than @xmath78 .",
    "thus , even though the planet itself may out of our line of sight , the ring could transit . in the case of saturn , for example , the outer radius of its ring system ( @xmath81  cm for the e  ring ) is almost ten times larger than the radius of the planet .",
    "the angle @xmath82 in equation  2 is the angle between the plane of the ring and the orbital plane of the planet .",
    "if @xmath83 then transits by the ring will only be detected in some cases in which the planet transits as well . in those cases",
    "the effect of the ring will be striking , because it will produce a diminuation in light from the white dwarf that lasts significantly longer than the transit by the planet .",
    "if , however , the plane of the ring is oriented at a non - zero angle @xmath82 relative to the orbital plane , then the probability of a transit by the rings can be greater than the probability of a transit by the planet .",
    "if a saturn - like planet were to orbit a white dwarf at @xmath85  au , then with @xmath86 the value of @xmath76 would be @xmath87 if such systems are common , then a ring transit could be discovered by monitoring one to two dozen white dwarfs .",
    "planets are also orbited by moons .",
    "our own solar system contains more than @xmath88 moons , many large enough to produce transits of a white dwarf that would be detectable by _ kepler . _ the cases in which a moon is likely to produce a transit , even if the planet does not transit , are those in which the planet orbits the star many times during the course of the monitoring observations and in which the moon also orbits the planet many times during the same interval .",
    "let @xmath89 be the distance between the planet and its moon , and let @xmath82 be the angle between the orbital planes of the moon and planet . to compute @xmath76 ,",
    "the term @xmath78 in equation  2 must be replaced by @xmath90 consider a saturn - like planet orbited by a moon at @xmath91  cm ( an @xmath92  day orbit ) . if the distance of the saturn - like planet from an @xmath93 white dwarf is equal to @xmath94  au ( a @xmath95  day orbital period ) , and @xmath96 then @xmath97 as with the case of rings , the probability of that a detectable transit will occur during a year of monitoring one to two dozen white dwarfs is significant .",
    "altough we do not have the _ a priori _ knowledge needed to assess the likelihood of transits by rings or moons , the discovery that exoplanets commonly have properties that were unexpected leads us to consider a range of possibilities for planets orbiting white dwarfs . the considerations above show that , _ if _ ",
    "white dwarfs tend to be orbited by close - in planets , and i_if _  these planets have rings and/or moons , there is a chance that _ kepler _ will discover them by monitoring a modest number of white dwarfs . an all  sky survey with the sensitivity of _ kepler",
    "_ would either discover such systems or definitively rule them out .",
    "consider the possibility that white dwarfs host both asteroid systems and close - in planets with rings and/or moons .",
    "dynamical stability arguments place constraints on the number of close - in planets and on the linear dimensions of the system of moons orbiting each . unless , therefore , the asteroid systems are deficient in large asteroids relative to what we might expect based on the solar system , transits by asteroids should provide the dominant signal .",
    "the continuous monitoring of white dwarfs can lead to significant scientific results in addition to those associated with asteroids .",
    "if coherent oscillations are present in these stars , astroseismic analysis would reveal these modes at amplitudes of 16 ppm ( @xmath29 ) in just one month of data on a 15th magnitude star , and 4.6 ppm ( @xmath29 ) in one year .",
