    "at a distance of 54.8 mpc is a barred spiral galaxy with grand - design spiral arms and some peculiar stellar morphology . in the hubble atlas of galaxies",
    ", @xcite writes about ngc 3145 `` there is a single faint arm in the southwest quadrant which crosses one of the regular arms nearly at right angles .",
    "this is a very rare feature of galaxies ... '' we were intrigued by this description and by the presence of three additional places where stellar arms also appear to cross , forming `` x''-features , in ngc 3145 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand these puzzling features by investigating what is happening in the interstellar gas at the `` x''-features and elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "ngc 3145 has two smaller companions : the barred spiral and the sdm galaxy .",
    "we refer to these three galaxies as the ngc 3145 triplet .",
    "the top panel in figure[b.features ] displays a @xmath6-band image of ngc 3145 with some of the optical oddities marked , and the bottom panel displays the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) @xmath7-band image of the southern half of this galaxy . on the southern side of the galaxy , arms cross and outline an apparent optical triangle with base @xmath8 , height @xmath9 , and apices labelled @xmath10 ( the eastern apex ) , @xmath11 ( the southern apex ) , and @xmath12 ( the western apex ) .",
    "we refer below to this feature as the _",
    "s peculiar arm outlines the eastern edge of the _ triangle_. it crosses the inner spiral arm , forming an `` x''-feature at apex @xmath10 ; at apex @xmath11 it produces another `` x''-feature . at the location marked @xmath13 in figure[b.features ] , it creates what looks like another `` x''-feature .",
    "the inner spiral arm , which has a major dust lane along its concave side , outlines the northern edge of the _ triangle _ , connecting apices @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "another arm connects apices @xmath11 and @xmath12 to form the western edge of the _ triangle_. at apex @xmath11 it meets sandage s peculiar arm .",
    "southward of apex @xmath11 the two arms diverge , and sandage s peculiar arm extends to the west .",
    "we call the latter the western antenna and label it @xmath14 in this figure . on the northeastern side of ngc 3145 , we label as feature @xmath15 the location where a feature that optically looks like a spiral - arm branch departs from the main spiral arm .",
    "we shall refer to this as the _ branch _ even though the data presented here suggest that it is a tidal arm .    in his study of caustic waveforms in two dimensions , @xcite notes that the _ triangle _ in ngc 3145 resembles a swallowtail caustic . in a swallowtail caustic ,",
    "five intersecting star streams create a triangular region outlined by arms plus two thin antennae emerging from one of the triangle s vertices . in his study ,",
    "swallowtail caustics develop within expanding pseudo - rings .",
    "gas streams do not pass through each other without colliding and shocking . to study the above optical anomalies and look for other unusual features in the gas , we made karl g. jansky very large array ( vla )  observations of the ngc 3145 triplet and @xmath0 cmradio continuum observations of ngc 3145 .",
    "we use the radio continuum image to check on whether there are strong shock fronts at the `` x''-features as would be expected if the intersecting arms are in the same plane .",
    "the purpose of the  data is to look for evidence of gas flows in extra - planar gas and gas flows perpendicular to the disk over large spatial scales , e.g. , are there multiple components in the  line profiles . for edge - on galaxies displacements above the disk would be obvious . since the inclination @xmath16 of ngc 3145 is @xmath17 , we get only indirect information .",

    "these would warp the disk by @xmath277 kpc .",
    "given the assumptions in the model , these values of @xmath274 and @xmath275 are uncertain by a factor of a few .",
    "a slightly steeper angle of attack with the same flyby velocity would give a more modest warp .",
    "the comparison in the appendix between the time elapsed since closest approach and rough estimates of the period of vertical oscillation of the warp suggests that the warp material may have experienced about one vertical oscillation .",
    "thus the extra - planar features produced by this encounter should still be present .",
    "ngc 3145 is a spiral galaxy with several optical peculiarities .",

    "our @xmath0 cm  radio continuum observations yield the following information about ngc 3145    \\(1 ) lack of prominent radio continuum emission at the eastern and southern apices of the _ triangle _ rules out shock fronts at the arm - crossing `` x '' s there .",
    "this means that the arms appearing to cross at these locations must be in different planes and that the portion of sandage s peculiar arm outlining the eastern edge of the _ triangle _ is not in the disk .",
    "\\(2 ) north of the _ triangle _ , there is extended radio continuum emission along sandage s peculiar arm .",
    "this is indicative of shocked gas .",
    "hence this portion of sandage s peculiar arm , which includes where it crosses the string of blue clumps , appears to be in the disk .",
    "the suggestion is that sandage s peculiar arm emerges from the disk before it reaches the _ triangle_.    our  observations find the following kinematic anomalies in ngc 3145 .",
    "\\(1 ) in large areas of ngc 3145 , the line - profiles are skewed . in the middle - to - outer part of the gas disk , line - profiles near the major axis consist of a large amplitude peak plus a broader , skewed wing .",
    "relative to the disk , the gas in the skewed wing has @xmath1-motions away from us on the approaching side of the galaxy and @xmath1-motions towards us on the receding side .",
    "the difference @xmath278 between the central velocity of the skewed wing and that of the large amplitude peak has a mean value @xmath210 km s@xmath3  on the approaching side and @xmath279 km s@xmath3on the receding side .",
    "this kinematic anti - symmetry implies that there has been a perturbation with a sizeable component perpendicular to the disk over large spatial scales , e.g. , the disk is undergoing a warping as a result of a close passage by one of its companions .",
    "we detect these warping motions out to a radius of at least @xmath168 = 28 kpc .",
    "\\(2 ) there are two features whose velocities imply that they are out - of - plane tidal arms .",
    "one is the apparent branch of the main spiral arm on the northeastern side of the galaxy . where the _ branch _ and the main spiral arm appear to intersect in projection ,",
    "the _ branch _ has a line - of - sight velocity @xmath4 km s@xmath3  greater than that of the main spiral arm .",
    "we conclude that the _ branch _ is an out - of - plane tidal arm and may have streaming motions along it .",
    "the other is sandage s peculiar arm as line - profiles of the western - antenna extension of sandage s peculiar arm exhibit two clearly distinct peaks of comparable amplitude separated by 56 km s@xmath3  in line - of - sight velocity .",
    "we attribute one of these to  in the disk and the other to  in sandage s peculiar arm , which thus appears to be another tidal arm .",
    "these arms appear relatively short for tidal arms ; more sensitive  observations are necessary to see if these tidal arms extend farther .",
    "\\(3 ) the distribution of  emission from ngc 3145 is not axisymmetric : within the main optical disk there are massive  concentrations nw , ne , and sw of the nucleus and a trough on the se side .",
    "this peculiarity is other evidence of an encounter .",
    "our observations solve the puzzle of sandage s peculiar arm , i.e. , it is a tidal arm tilted with respect to the plane of the disk of ngc 3145 , and this tidal arm emerges from the disk before it reaches the apparent arm crossings at the _",
    "triangle_. furthermore , our observations revealed anti - symmetric warping motions in ngc 3145 on large spatial scales out to 28 kpc .",
    "the two relatively - short , extra - planar tidal arms are evidence that ngc 3145 has recently experienced a combination of azimuthal and perpendicular perturbations .",
    "the warping motions are evidence that it has recently experienced a perpendicular perturbation affecting the middle - to - outer part of the gas disk .",
    "the sdm galaxy pgc 02978 shows no evidence of having undergone an encounter recently , whereas ngc 3143 has an enhanced sfr , somewhat of an  deficiency compared to its sfr ,   emission 50% more extended on its northeastern side than on the opposite side , and an apparently large molecular fraction for a small galaxy .",
    "thus ngc 3143 is the more likely of the two companions to have interacted with ngc 3145 .",
    "our simple analytic model demonstrates that an encounter between ngc 3143 and ngc 3145 is a plausible explanation for the observed warping motions in ngc 3145 .",

    "although the observations of the ngc 3145 system may not appear sufficient to constrain narrowly the parameters of the collision that likely produced the anomalous disk structure of ngc 3145 , one factor gives considerable leverage : the companions are far from the primary i.e. , more than a few primary diameters .",
    "it is possible that the relative orbit is hyperbolic . yet a second fact , that the mass ratio is evidently less than 10% , makes that unlikely .",
    "a hyperbolic encounter with a low mass companion will not have much effect .",
    "a slightly bound orbit is more likely . in either case , the effects of dynamical friction are probably minimal .",
    "we assume that the relative orbit is marginally bound and , based on the arguments in section 5 , that ngc 3143 is the collision companion .",
    "we use its observed properties : plane - of - sky distance from ngc 3145 = 140 kpc and line - of - sight relative velocity= 125 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc 3145 is relatively flat beyond 13 kpc , so we can make the further simplifying assumption that the dark - halo density profile ( and logarithmic potential ) is the same all the way out to the companion . in that case the orbital shape will be well described by the p - ellipse approximation of @xcite , especially by figs .",
    "6 - 8 of the latter paper . even though we do not know the angular orientations of the orbit , knowing its shape is helpful",
    "for example , a very radial p - ellipse in this potential is significantly curved only near its maximum and minimum radii , and is nearly straight otherwise .",
    "this , in turn , tells us that unless the companion is at its maximum radius ( apoapse ) , its direction of motion has changed little since it left the vicinity of the primary .",
    "this means that the trajectory has not curved or bowed out into the e - w direction , but lies mostly in the plane containing the n - s line , and perpendicular to the sky .",
    "two interrelated questions remain : 1 ) what is the angle of the companion s trajectory relative to the plane of the sky and , 2 ) how close is the companion to apoapse ?",
    "given the large visible separation between the two galaxies , and the fact that particles on very radial orbits spend most of their time near apoapse , it seems reasonable to suppose that the companion is indeed near apoapse .",
    "the following energy equation provides a constraint ,      where @xmath173 is the current relative velocity of the companion , so the left - hand side of the equation is the specific kinetic energy .",
    "the right - hand side is the potential energy difference between the current radius @xmath281 and the apoapse radius @xmath282 . here",
    "@xmath283 is the mass contained within the radius @xmath281 .",
    "specifically ,      where the ` o ' subscript refers to values at the radius of ngc 3145 beyond which the trajectory of the companion is assumed to be nearly straight until it reaches apoapse . from table[hiproperties ] we take @xmath285 = 33 kpc and @xmath286 = @xmath287 @xmath72 .      @xmath288 = \\frac{-r_1 { v_1}^2}{2gm_1 }   = \\\\   -0.12 \\left ( \\frac{r_o}{33\\ { \\rm kpc } } \\right )      \\left ( \\frac{v_1}{125\\ { \\rm km\\   s^{-1 } } } \\right)^2 \\left ( \\frac{5 \\times 10^{11}\\ m_{\\odot}}{m_o } \\right ) ( \\sin \\theta)^{-2 } , \\label{eqa3}\\ ] ]    where the sine term accounts for the angle between the trajectory and the plane of the sky , and the fact that we observe the velocity component perpendicular to it .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath289 , then @xmath290 = 200 kpc , @xmath291 = 177 km s@xmath3 , and the radius ratio is @xmath292 .",
    "this value for the radius ratio is consistent with the assumption that the companion is near apoapse .",
    "we do not know the angle of attack of the companion trajectory relative to the ngc 3145 disk . however , given that the disk does not have a strong ring , the impact was unlikely to be perpendicular .",
    "ngc 3145 has two features that are extra - planar tidal arms , one in the northeast and the other in the south to southwest , and neither is a prominent , long tidal tail .",
    "therefore the impact was unlikely to be planar .",
    "the combination of the two stubby , out - of - plane tidal arms ( evidence for azimuthal and perpendicular perturbations ) and the global warp suggests an intermediate angle of attack .",
    "this yields @xmath296 .",
    "the formulae of @xcite , suggest that such an orbit will turn through an angle of about @xmath297 near closest approach .",
    "thus , we can envision its closest approach arc as roughly semi - circular ( @xmath298 on either side of the impact point ) , with a radius of about @xmath299 kpc and a fairly shallow angle of impact . at the ends of this arc",
    "the companion is about one radius length above or below ( different sectors of ) the disk . on the incoming end it will pull up . on the outgoing end",
    "it will pull down .",
    "assume the companion pulls on each of these disk sectors for a time roughly equal to the time it takes to traverse half the curved arc , i.e. , a time about equal to about ( 15 kpc/470 km s@xmath3 ) @xmath300 myr .",
    "then , the vertical velocity impulse felt by that sector is about ,      where the companion mass has been assumed to be about @xmath302 , and it is assumed that the mean vertical acceleration occurs when the companion is at a z distance equal to about @xmath303 of @xmath304 , i.e. , a moderately shallow angle of attack relative to the disk plane .",
    "this shows that it is plausible that the encounter has warped the disk of ngc 3145 by at least several kpc . at the given flyby velocity , a slightly steeper angle than that assumed in eq .",
    "( a6 ) would give a more modest warp , while a shallower angle would give an even stronger warp .",
    "if the flyby velocity was much greater , then the material would not be lifted to kpc levels .",
    "if the flyby velocity was much lower , with the moderate angle of attack , longer tails would be produced .",
    "there are also some timescale constraints , for example , how does the time since closest encounter compare to the oscillation time of the warp ? if the latter is much shorter than the former , we might expect the warp to have smoothed away by the present . as an estimate for the former we can use the half period of the adopted p - ellipse orbit .",
    "this period is given by eq .",
    "( c4 ) in appendix c of @xcite ( with a small error corrected ) . in the present notation ,",
    "the half - period can be written as ,        the oscillation time can be estimated by the vertical epicyclic frequency of the disk . since most of the warp is relatively far out in the disk , we assume that the local gravity of the disk there is negligible and the restoring force",
    "is provided by the vertical component of the total gravity interior to that radius .",
    "this approximation seems especially appropriate for a large warp involving most of the local disk material .",
    "then we can approximate the vertical restoring gravitational acceleration as ,              taken at face value the comparison of eqs .",
    "( a8 ) and ( a11 ) suggest that the warp has gone through a few epicyclic oscillations by the present .",
    "this is possible , but it is more likely that the oscillation period is considerably longer .",
    "the first reason for this is that the epicyclic approximation assumes a very small excursion . since the estimate of eq .",
    "( a7 ) yields a fairly large excursion , the true nonlinear oscillation period is likely much longer .",
    "the second reason is that once the material in the warp moves out of the disk plane it will not be centripetally balanced in the radial direction .",
    "its true motion ( even in an azimuthally co - rotating frame ) will be a combination of nonlinear vertical and radial oscillations .",
    "this will introduce another significant increase in the overall period .",
    "thus , it is likely that the vertical epicyclic timescale should be increased by a factor of a few , and the warp material has experienced about one oscillation .",
    "these timescale considerations further constrain the putative encounter , and especially the angle - of - attack . in sum ,",
    "if ngc 3143 is indeed the collision companion , then the structure of the encounter is quite constrained .",
