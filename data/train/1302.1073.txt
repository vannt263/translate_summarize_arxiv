    "superconducting correlations in graphene - based structures have been the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental research even before graphene became one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics .",
    "following last decade experimental evidences reporting hints of superconductivity behavior in graphite @xcite and graphite intercalated compounds @xcite , a considerable amount of theoretical studies have been devoted to provide a clear understanding about possible mechanisms that could induce intrinsic superconducting states in single and multilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "more recently experimental investigations have reported intriguing traces of high - temperature superconducting behavior in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) samples @xcite , feeding speculations about the existence of intrinsic superconducting correlations in graphite and graphite - based compounds . despite the fact that most of these experimental evidence suggests that superconductivity in graphite compounds appears due to external causes , several theoretical studies reveal the possibility of inducing superconductivity in graphite by considering unconventional symmetry of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations show that superconductivity becomes stable after considering disorder @xcite or high doping in the graphene layers @xcite while surface superconductivity appears to be stable in clean rhombohedral graphite in the absence of external doping @xcite .",
    "considering that most of these calculations are based on a reduced hamiltonian or are performed within two - dimensional models , by ignoring the interplanar hopping , a numerical description of the superconducting correlation in multilayer graphene is urgently needed .",
    "in view of this , we provide in the following a numerical description of intrinsic superconductivity in multilayer graphene at the tight - binding level . following ref . , we consider a simple s - wave pairing symmetry in a abc ( or rhombohedral ) stacking multilayered graphene structure .",
    "calculations are also performed for aba ( or bernal ) stacking where its quadratic low - energy band structure @xcite shows a remarkable difference from the @xmath0 momentum dependent band structure seen in abc multilayer @xcite structures .",
    "in particular we are interested in the limit of large number of layers ( @xmath1 ) where the lower - energy band in the rhombohedral case is flat over a large region in k - space signaling the suppression of the kinetic energy and therefore resulting in strong effect from interactions .",
    "in addition , because of the sensitive stacking dependent band structure in multilayer graphene , we also considered hybrid stacking cases .",
    "it is known that exfoliated few - layer graphite samples are usually found to exhibit very stable bernal stacking but often also display rhombohedral structures in part of the sample @xcite .",

    "translational invariance is assumed along the 2-dimensional direction within the graphene sheets . in this way",
    ", an adequate description for the profile of superconducting correlations along the direction perpendicular to the graphene layers is achieved .",
    "our results confirm the main features of recent analytical approaches for abc rhombohedral graphite where an enhancement of surface superconductivity , with respect to its bulk analog , was recently predicted @xcite .",
    "we find that the opposite behavior is present in aba stacking where bulk dominates over surface superconductivity .",
    "this fact requires that a strong pairing potential is needed in order to obtain a non - zero pair correlation for the aba case .",
    "in contrast , in the abc case , a lower pairing potential is sufficient to induce a large pair amplitude at the surface .",
