    "the flux is in units of @xmath14/s / cadence ( log@xmath15 scale ) and 18911 long cadence ( lc ) aperture photometry measurements are plotted . since the 1.4-m telescope was rolled by 90@xmath16 every three months resulting in a given star being observed with different pixels every ` quarter ' , it was necessary to correct for sensitivity variations from quarter to quarter , and for drift within each quarter .",
    "the @xmath7 magnitudes were derived from the fully normalized and detrended photometry . the scalloped pattern seen at maximum and minimum light , and the moir pattern seen everywhere , result from the pulsation period for this star , 0.571  d , not being evenly divisible by the lc sampling period , @xmath130 min , giving rise to 27 observations per pulsation cycle .",
    "the constancy of the range in the total amplitude is remarkable , as is the continuous moir pattern .",
    "the pulsation period for each star ( fundamental mode ) was derived from the high - precision aperture photometry using the period04 period - finding program ( lenz & breger 2005 ) and a version of the clean program written by dr .",
    "seung - lee kim ( see nemec , walker & jeon 2009 ) . typically the lc data consisted of @xmath118000 points , and the short cadence ( sc ) observations of fn  lyr and aw  dra ( q0 and q5 ) amounted to another @xmath1150000 data points per star .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived periods are @xmath11 - 2@xmath17d , depending on the particular data set and pulsation period , @xmath18 .",
    "times of maximum light , @xmath19 , accurate to @xmath200.0005  d also were computed .",

    ".    phased light curves for all 19 non - blazhko stars were plotted using the derived pulsation periods and times of maximum light .",
    "two such light curves are illustrated in the top panels of * figure  2*. the light curve for fn  lyr is based on 18338 lc data points acquired over @xmath1400 days in q1-q5 , and that on the right is for aw  dra and is based on 135380 sc data points acquired over 90 days in q5 .",
    "when the light curves for all the stars are plotted one clearly sees variations in the ` risetimes ' ( _ i.e. _ , the time from minimum to maximum light , expressed in phase units ) , the stars with the shortest risetimes having the largest amplitudes and a tendency to have a bump on the rise to maximum light .",
    "also analyzed were new high precision ground - based @xmath6 photometry for three of the stars ( nr  lyr , fn  lyr and aw  dra ) , and all sky automated survey ( asas ) @xmath21 photometry ( see pigulski _ et al . _ 2009 ) for nine of the brightest stars .",
    "the high - precision calculations were instrumental in establishing the @xmath6-@xmath7 offsets in the fourier parameters ( needed to permit use of the kovcs , jurcsik _ et al .",
    "_ relations ) ; and the asas - north data ( http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/kepler ) , although not providing high - precision fourier parameters , were sufficient for deriving reliable loop diagrams in the hr - diagram , from which it is clear that in every case the non - blazhko stars are bluest when brightest ( as expected ) .    by combining the historical data ( going back more than 100 years for fn  lyr , nq  lyr and aw  dra ) with the _ kepler _ data we were also able to derive period change rates for some of the stars .",
    "in particular , the periods for fn  lyr and aw  dra were seen to be increasing .",
    "unfortunately the baseline of the _ kepler _ observations is still too short to derive significant period variations directly .",
    "finally , one of the non - blazhko stars , kic  7021124 , was discovered to be doubly - periodic and to have properties very similar to v350  lyr ( benk _ et al .",
    "both appear to be pulsating in the fundamental and second - overtone modes simultaneously .",
    "the period ratios are almost identical , @xmath22 for kic  7021124 , and 0.592 for v350  lyr . when masses are derived for these two stars using the petersen @xmath23 vs. @xmath24 diagram the best agreement with the models is obtained , in both cases , for a high luminosity and a high mass : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the fourier calculations were made with two fortran programs , one kindly provided by dr .",
    "gza kovcs , and the other by dr .",
    "pawel moskalik .",
    "the assumed pulsation periods were those derived either from the _ kepler _ data or from the period change rate analysis , and the @xmath19 values were calculated numerically .",
    "the fourier analyses were performed on various subsets of the data .",
    "the bottom panels of fig.2 show residual plots after fitting 38-term fourier descriptions to all the data . in both cases",
    "the standard deviations about the mean curve are below 1 mmag , specifically @xmath160 @xmath36magn , and the greatest differences occur where the slope is steepest . for the purposes of using extant fourier correlations to derive physical characteristics only the lower order fourier",
    "terms are needed .",
    "owing to the small risetimes as many as 100 or more terms could be needed for a normal distribution of the residuals .",
    "another way of looking at the data was to calculate fourier coefficients and parameters for each pulsation cycle .",
    "for the long cadence ( 30 min ) data there were @xmath124 observations per bin for an rrab star with a period of 12 hours , and fewer ( more ) observations per cycle for stars with shorter ( longer ) periods .",
    "none of the 19 stars exhibits the recently discovered `` period doubling '' effect , thus confirming the result found earlier by szab _",
    "for the fourier calculations ` direct fourier fitting ' ( dff ) rather than ` template fourier fitting ' ( tff ) methods were used ( see kovcs & kupi 2007 ) , and for each star the resulting time series were plotted for four fourier parameters : @xmath37 , the first term in the fourier series ( see right panel of fig .  2 ) ; @xmath38 , the phase of the first term ; @xmath39 , the amplitude ratio @xmath40 ; and @xmath41 , the fourier parameter found by simon , kovcs and others to be one of the most significant variables for deriving physical characteristics .",
    "typical time series are illustrated in * figure  3 * , on the left for the unmodulated rrab star nq  lyr having intermediate amplitude ( @xmath37=0.279 mag ) and intermediate brightness ,",
    "@xmath42  mag , and on the right for v783  cyg , a low - amplitude blazhko star with the shortest blazhko period ( @xmath43  d ) among the stars in the sample . for nq",
    "lyr linear trend lines were fit to each time series and in almost every case the slope is zero to within the systematic and random uncertainties .",
    "the mean values for the four parameters are as follows : @xmath44 , with residual standard error , @xmath45 ; @xmath46 , with @xmath47 ; @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ; and @xmath50 mag , with @xmath51 .",

    "are systematically larger than the @xmath2(puls ) values . for the four metal - rich stars",
    "the agreement is better but there is a wide range of @xmath2(evol ) owing to the linear or non - linear [ fe / h ] dependencies . regardless of which formula",
    "was used the most luminous stars have the lowest metallicities and there is internal consistence .",
    "it is not clear whether the @xmath2(puls ) or @xmath2(evol ) are correct . as was the case for the luminosities , the @xmath3(evol )",

    "the @xmath2(puls ) and @xmath78(puls ) are seen to be systematically smaller than values derived from the zahb tracks ( for the appropriate metal abundance ) .",
    "the reddest non - blazhko rr  lyr stars lie close to the fundamental mode red - edge and have the smallest amplitudes .",
    "this graph also shows blue and red edges of the instability strip for the fundamental mode ( red and blue solid lines ) and first - overtone mode ( red and blue dashed lines ) .",
    "the edges were calculated with the warsaw pulsation code assuming a mass of 0.65  @xmath80 .",
    "the _ kepler _ non - blazhko stars all lie in the fundamental mode region of the variability strip , and the smallest amplitude rr  lyr stars ( the four metal - rich stars , kic  7030715 and nr  lyr ) have locations near the fundamental red edge ( fre ) of the instability strip .",

    "enhancing the oxygen to iron ratio by the plotted amounts makes little difference .",

    "( 2011 ) paper concludes with a section on hydrodynamic models computed with the smolec and moskalik ` warsaw convective pulsation program ' .",
    "perhaps most relevant for the discussion above is the conclusion that in the @xmath18-@xmath70 diagram when [ fe / h ] is varied from @xmath81 to @xmath82 dex there is very little motion at a given amplitude .",
    "instead , motion to longer periods at a given amplitude occurs for stars of higher @xmath2 for a given mass , or for stars of lower mass for a given luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the main factors causing period shifts in the @xmath18-@xmath70 diagram seem to be the mass and luminosity , the latter being caused either by higher zahb mass or by post - zahb evolution .",
