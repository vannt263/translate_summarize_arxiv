    "cosmic strings @xcite are linear topological defects which arise in a range of relativistic quantum field theories ( for reviews see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "good analogs of cosmic strings are vortex lines in superfluids and superconductors .",
    "line defects in crystals can be viewed as another analog system .",
    "cosmic strings form lines of trapped energy density , and this energy density can curve space - time and have important effects in cosmology @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings are predicted to form in many particle physics models beyond the standard model . in particular , they are predicted to form at the end of inflation in many inflationary models , e.g. supergravity models @xcite and brane inflation models @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings may also survive as cosmic superstrings in alternatives to inflation such as  string gas cosmology \" @xcite .",
    "the key point for cosmology is that in any field theory model which admits cosmic string solutions , a network of strings inevitably forms at some point during the early universe @xcite , and it persists to the present time .",
    "hence , the detection of cosmic strings would give us information about particle physics at very high energy scales .",
    "since cosmic strings are relativistic objects , a straight string is described by one number , namely its mass per unit length @xmath0 which also equals its tension , or equivalently by the dimensionless number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is newton s gravitational constant ( we are using units in which the speed of light is @xmath3 ) . in simple quantum field theory models",
    "the tension is related to the energy scale @xmath4 at which the strings are formed via @xmath5 ( see the following section for a more precise discussion ) .",
    "the cosmological signatures of strings are thus more substantial for larger values of @xmath0 which implies larger values of the energy scale @xmath4 .",
    "hence , searching for cosmological signatures of strings is a tool to probe particle physics beyond the standard model at the highest energy scales ( as opposed to accelerator experiments like the lhc which probe new physics at low energy scales ) .",
    "in fact , current limits on cosmic strings already @xcite provide a constraint g < 1.5 10 ^ -7 which rules out certain grand unified particle physics models with very high scale symmetry breaking .",
    "this limit comes from the observational upper bound on the contribution of cosmic strings to the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies obtained by combining the results of the wmap satellite @xcite with those of the south pole telescope @xcite ( see also @xcite for a comparable limit obtained by combining results from wmap and from the atacama cosmology telescope @xcite , and @xcite for earlier limits ) .    given the constraints on particle physics models which can be derived from current observations , it is of great interest to try to improve the observational upper bounds on the cosmic string tension since this will allow us to constrain high energy scale particle physics models more strongly than what is possible today .",
    "cosmic strings can also produce many good things for cosmology in addition to contributing to cosmological structure formation .",
    "cosmic strings may play a role in baryogenesis ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "certain types of strings can provide a mechanism for the production @xcite of seed magnetic fields which are coherent on galactic scales cusps on cosmic string loops can also yield a contribution to ultra - high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "finally , cosmic string loops may assist in the assembly of the large mass concentrations required to seed super - massive black holes .    for all of the above reasons it would thus be wonderful to have evidence for the existence of cosmic strings in nature .",
    "the search for cosmic strings is therefore of great interest independent of whether the search in fact finds signals of cosmic strings .",
    "if it does , then we will have discovered something completely new in the universe .",
    "if it does not , then we will have derived tighter constraints on particle physics at very high energy scales .    in this talk i will review recent work on signatures of cosmic strings in new observational windows . up to the present time ,",
    "the tightest and most robust constraints on the cosmic string tension have come from analyses of cmb temperature maps .",
    "here , i will focus on the signatures of strings in cmb polarization maps and 21 cm redshift surveys , two emerging windows to explore the cosmos .",
    "the main points to take away from this talk are the following .",
    "firstly , cosmic strings lead to nonlinearities already at very high redshifts .",
    "hence , the signatures of cosmic strings are more pronounced at higher than at lower redshifts where they are masked by the nonlinearities produced by the gaussian density fluctuations which must be present and which dominate the total power spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "secondly , cosmic strings lead to perturbations which are highly non - gaussian and which predict specific geometrical patterns in position space . by computing a power spectrum , information about these patterns",
    "hence , tighter limits on the cosmic string tension can be obtained if we analyze the data in position space .",
    "thirdly , 21 cm redshift surveys appear to be an ideal window to search for cosmic string signatures @xcite .",
    "the outline of this talk is as follows .",
    "we first present a brief review of the basics of cosmic strings . in section 3",
    "we introduce the two main mechanisms which will play a role in determining the cosmic string signals in observations , namely the kaiser - stebbins @xcite ( see also @xcite ) lensing effect and the cosmic string wake @xcite .",
    "we also briefly review the well - known resulting signal of strings in cmb temperature maps .",
    "the key sections of this talk are sections 4 and 5 . in the first",
    ", we discuss the signal of a long straight cosmic string in cmb polarization maps , and in the second we turn to the signal in 21 cm redshift surveys .",
    "in a class of relativistic quantum field theories , cosmic strings form after a phase transition in the early universe during which an internal symmetry in field space is spontaneously broken .",
    "let us consider a simple toy model involving a complex scalar field @xmath6 with potential v ( ) = ( ||^2 - ^2 ) ^2 where @xmath4 is the vacuum expectation value of the modulus of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a coupling constant .    to determine whether a particular field theory admits cosmic string solutions or not , the key concept is that of the _ vacuum manifold _ @xmath8 , the set of field values which minimizes the potential . in the above example",
    "@xmath8 is homotopically equivalent to the circle @xmath9 .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the potential obtains finite temperature corrections @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "specifically , there is an extra contribution v_t ( ) ~ t^2 ||^2 , where @xmath10 is the temperature . hence , there is a critical temperature @xmath11 above which the lowest potential energy state is @xmath12 and the field symmetry ( rotation in the complex field plane ) is unbroken .",
    "thus , in the early universe the average value of @xmath6 at each point in space will be @xmath12 , but as the universe cools below the temperature @xmath11 this state becomes unstable and at each point in space @xmath6 will want to roll down the potential to take on a value in @xmath8 .",
    "the key point is @xcite that by causality there can be no correlation between the field values in @xmath8 which are taken on at points in space which are out of causal contact , i.e. which are further apart than the hubble distance @xmath13 .",
    "hence , there is a probability of order @xmath14 that the field values in @xmath8 evaluated for a loop @xmath15 in space of radius @xmath13 will form an incontractible loop in @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that there must be a point in space on any disk bounded by @xmath15 where @xmath12 . around these points there is trapped potential and spatial gradient energy .",
    "energy minimization arguments make it obvious that the distinguished points on different disks ( with the same boundary ) form part of a line .",
    "this line is the cosmic string .",
    "it is a line of points with @xmath12 surrounded by a tube of trapped energy .",
    "the width @xmath16 of the tube is determined by minimizing the sum of potential and spatial gradient energy , leading to the result w = ^-1/2 ^-1 such that the resulting mass per unit length @xmath0 is independent of the coupling constant : = ^2 ( up to numerical factors independent of @xmath7 ) .    to recap",
    ", causality tells us that at the symmetry breaking phase transition at time @xmath17 a network of cosmic strings will form in any field theory model which admits cosmic string solutions .",
    "cosmic strings are closed - they can not have ends .",
    "hence , they are either string loops or infinite in length .",
    "note that causality in fact ensures that ( in an infinite space ) strings of infinite length will be formed . a way to picture the network of strings is as a random walk with typical curvature radius @xmath18 which is bounded from above by the hubble length @xmath13 .    the same causality argument which is used to predict the formation of strings",
    "can be used to show that the network of strings will survive at all times @xmath19 , including the present time .",
    "hence , cosmic strings formed in the very early universe will lead to signatures which can be searched for in current cosmological observations .",
    "we will work in terms of a one - scale model @xcite of the cosmic string distribution which is given by the correlation length @xmath18 which describes both the mean curvature radius and the separation of the  long \" strings (  long \" meaning with length greater than @xmath13 ) .",
    "kibble s causality argument tells us that @xmath20 .",
    "dynamical arguments show that @xmath18 can not be much smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "the argument is as follows : cosmic strings are relativistic objects .",
    "if the curvature radius is smaller than @xmath13 , then the strings will move with relativistic speed .",
    "hence , intersections of strings will occur .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that unless the relative speed of two intersecting string segments is extremely close to the speed of light , then the string segments will not cross , but they will intersect and exchange ends . in this way , the long strings can form string loops , which in turn oscillate and decay by emitting gravitational radiation .",
    "this process is described by a boltzmann equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) from which it follows that if @xmath21 then @xmath22 will increase , and that there will be a dynamical fixed point _ scaling solution _ with ( t ) ~t .",
    "the approach to a scaling solution has been confirmed in a series of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the process of long string intercommutation leaves behind a distribution of cosmic string loops which also achieves a scale - invariant form .",
    "we will not discuss this issue since we will focus on the cosmological signatures of the long strings .",
    "since cosmic strings carry energy , they can gravitate and produce cosmological signals .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite . in the early 1980s cosmic strings",
    "were studied as an alternative to cosmological inflation @xcite .",
    "cosmic string formation produces entropy fluctuations on super - hubble scales which then seed a curvature fluctuation which grows on super - hubble scales .",
    "such fluctuations are called  active \" .",
    "they are also  incoherent \" meaning that there are no phase correlations in phase space between different fourier modes @xcite .",
    "hence , although cosmic strings predict a spectrum of density fluctuations which is scale - invariant and hence an angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies which is also scale - invariant on large angular scales @xcite , the acoustic oscillations which are characteristic of models like inflation where a scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations are generated whose amplitude remains constant on super - hubble scales are absent @xcite .",
    "once the acoustic oscillations were discovered by various experiments such as the boomerang experiment @xcite , interest in cosmic strings collapsed .",
    "however , given the realization that cosmic strings are produced after inflation in many particle physics models , interest in searching for observational signatures of cosmic strings as a supplementary ( not main ) source of structure in the universe has increased .",
    "the search for strings in the cosmos is emerging as a promising way to probe physics at energy scales much larger than those that can ever be reached in terrestrial accelerators , as already mentioned above .",
    "independent of whether strings are in fact discovered or the bounds on the existence of strings are improved we will have learned a lot about particle physics .",
    "in this talk i will focus on gravitational effects of cosmic strings .",
    "these are based on two main  actors \" , firstly the _ kaiser - stebbins _ lensing effect @xcite , and secondly the existence of _ string wakes _ @xcite .",
    "the string lensing effect is based on the fact that a long straight cosmic string with equal tension and energy per unit length leads to a conical structure of space perpendicular to the string @xcite .",
    "unwrapping the cone onto a plane leads to a  deficit angle \" = 8 g .",
    "if we now consider a cosmic string with transverse velocity @xmath23 and associated relativistic gamma factor @xmath24 , then if we look at the cmb in direction of the string ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , then photons passing on the two sides of the string are observed with a relative doppler shift = 8 ( v ) v g .",
    "this leads to a line discontinuity in the cmb sky , the linear direction corresponding to the projection of the tangent vector of the string onto our last light cone @xcite .     in a direction transverse to the direction of the string ,",
    "then photons passing on different sides of the string are measured with a relative doppler shift .",
    "this is the kaiser - stebbins effect.,height=302 ]    given a scaling distribution of strings , each string which intersects our past light cone will lead to a line discontinuity in the cmb sky . as shown in @xcite , for strings formed at a phase transition at time @xmath25 in the early universe ( as opposed to idealized strings being present at all times ) , the deficit angle at time @xmath13 has finite depth @xmath26 , namely d(t ) ( t - t_c ) t for @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the signature of an individual string in the sky corresponds to a rectangle in the sky with the above value of @xmath28 .",
    "the dimensions of the rectangle are the angles given by the comoving distances corresponding to length @xmath29 and depth @xmath13 , where @xmath30 is a constant of order @xmath14 .",
    "we will be making use of a toy model for the ( long ) cosmic string scaling first introduced in @xcite and widely used since then in cosmic string research .",
    "we replace the infinite string network at time @xmath13 by a set of straight string segments of length @xmath29 whose center of mass positions , tangent vectors and velocity vectors are randomly distributed and uncorrelated .",
    "these string segments live for one hubble expansion time ( the average time between string intercommutations ) . in the subsequent hubble time steps",
    "there are new string segments with larger length whose centers , tangent and velocity vectors are assumed to be uncorrelated with those of the string segments in the previous hubble time step . as a reflection of the scaling of the string network , we consider a fixed number @xmath31 per string segments in each hubble volume .",
    "the number @xmath31 can be determined by comparing with numerical simulations .",
    "causality tells us that @xmath32 .",
    "numerical simulations give values of the order @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "string segments in each hubble time step contribute to the total kaiser - stebbins effect .",
    "string segments in the first hubble time step after recombination are the most numerous .",
    "the size in the sky of the corresponding temperature patches is about one degree .",
    "strings from later hubble time steps are less numerous but larger ( see fig .",
    "patch of the sky at @xmath34 resolution ( the specifications are chosen to be comparable to those of the spt and act telescopes - in fact both of these telescopes map a larger fraction of the sky ) in a model in which the fluctuations are given by a scaling distribution of cosmic strings . the color coding indicates the amplitude of the temperature anisotropy.,height=529 ]    to identify the signal of cosmic strings in cmb temperature maps , good angular resolution is more important than full sky coverage .",
    "hence , experiments such as spt and act will yield better limits than even the planck satellite .",
    "the distinctive edges in cmb temperature maps produced by strings are washed out in the angular power spectrum .",
    "hence , tighter limits can be set on the string tension by analyzing the cmb maps in position space using edge detection algorithms rather than by simply computing a power spectrum .",
    "specifically , by using a numerical implementation of the canny edge detection algorithm @xcite it appears that a bound one order of magnitude stronger than the current bound might be achievable by using data from the spt telescope @xcite ( see also @xcite for initial work on applying the canny algorithm to cmb maps ) .",
    "the projected bound is g 2 10 ^ -8 .",
    "the second main  actor \" in the story presented here is the cosmic string wake @xcite , consider a long straight string segment moving through the uniform matter distribution of the early universe . from the point of view of a point behind the moving string",
    ", it appears as though matter acquires a velocity perturbation v = 4 v ( v ) g from above and below towards the plane behind the moving string .",
    "this in turn leads to a wedge - shaped overdensity ( twice the background density ) behind the string .",
    "this is the _",
    "wake_.    working again in the context of the toy model of @xcite , each string segment in each hubble expansion time generated a wake .",
    "consider a string at time @xmath35 .",
    "the physical dimension of the induced wake at the time @xmath35 will be c_1 t_i v ( v ) t_i 4 v ( v ) g t_i , where the first factor is the size along the tangent vector of the string , the second factor is the depth ( in direction opposite to the string motion ) , and the third factor is the mean width . at the leading edge ( the instantaneous location of the string ) , the width of the wake is zero , whereas at the trailing edge ( the initial position of the string segment ) the width is twice the mean width @xmath16 .",
    "is the string velocity @xmath23 , and @xmath36 is its related gamma factor.,height=170 ]    once formed , a wake will grow in thickness via gravitational accretion .",
    "this process can be studied using the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider a shell of matter which is located initially ( at the time @xmath35 when the wake is laid down ) at a physical height @xmath37 above the center of the wake .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is the initial comoving height . as a consequence of the gravitational pull of the matter overdensity in the wake , a comoving displacement @xmath39 gradually builds up ( where @xmath40 ) . the physical height at time @xmath41 then can be written as h(q , t ) = a(t ) ( q - ) , where @xmath42 is the cosmological scale factor . the time evolution of the height is then determined via newtonian gravity = - , where @xmath43 is the newtonian gravitational potential which is determined via the poisson equation in terms of the mass overdensity .",
    "we then calculate the value @xmath44 ( which we call @xmath45 ) for which the shell is  turning around \" at time @xmath13 , i.e. = 0 . after turnaround",
    ", the shell will virialize at a physical height which is half the turnaround height this virialized region forms the wake .",
    "the result of a straightforward calculation shows that ( in agreement with what follows from linear perturbation theory ) , the comoving height of the wake grows linearly in the scale factor , i.e. q_nl(t , t_i ) = v ( v ) g ( z(t_i ) + 1)^-1/2 t_0 , where the expression on the right hand side is the ratio of scale factors multiplying the initial comoving width of the wake ( modulo a factor of order @xmath14 ) .",
    "note that @xmath46 is the cosmological redshift . in the context of cosmic strings",
    "this analysis was originally done in @xcite ( accretion onto loops ) and @xcite ( accretion onto wakes ) .",
    "since the turnaround height itself is half the height the shell would have if it were simply to expand with the hubble flow , the resulting overdensity in the wake is a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "note that for accretion onto a string loop , the resulting overdensity is @xmath48 since there is contraction in all three spatial directions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us end this section with a couple of comments .",
    "first of all , the planar dimensions of the wake will retain constant comoving size .",
    "secondly , there is an important difference between the lensing signal due to string segments and the wake signal .",
    "since the string segment only lives for one hubble expansion time , only strings whose finite time world sheet intersects the past light cone lead to an observable signal . on the other hand ,",
    "wakes persist even after the string segment which has seeded them has decayed .",
    "hence , all string segments within the past light cone lead to observable wake signals . in the following ,",
    "it is signals due to wakes which will be discussed .",
    "when primordial cmb quadrupole radiation scatters off of a gas cloud , the residual free electrons in the cloud lead to polarization .",
    "wakes are regions of enhanced density , and hence also of enhanced free electron density .",
    "photons emitted at the time of recombination acquire extra polarization when they pass through a string wake .",
    "it is this signal which we study here @xcite .",
    "there are two polarization modes - e and b modes .",
    "a gaussian random field of density fluctuations leads to pure e - mode polarization .",
    "in contrast , cosmic string wakes lead to a statistically equal distribution of e and b - mode polarization .",
    "the reason for the generation of a b - mode component is that there is a distinguished vector given by the normal vector to the wake .",
    "this vector is independent of the cmb quadrupole vector .",
    "the amplitude @xmath49 of the polarization signal depends on the column density of free electrons which the cmb photons encounter when they cross the wake . if @xmath13 is the time when the photons are passing through the wake , the column density is proportional to the residual ionization fraction @xmath50 at time @xmath13 , the number density of baryons and the width of the wake .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is then determined by multiplying the result with the scattering cross section @xmath51 and the amplitude @xmath52 of the cmb quadrupole .",
    "the result is ( see @xcite for details ) : [ result ] & & ( ) ^1/2 _ t f(t ) g v ( v ) + & & _ b _ c(t_0 ) m_p^-1 t_0 ( z(t ) + 1 ) ^2 ( z(t_i ) + 1 ) ^1/2 , where @xmath35 is the time when the wake is laid down , @xmath53 is the fraction of the total energy density which is in baryons , and @xmath54 is the critical energy density ( energy density of a spatially flat universe ) at the present time @xmath55 .",
    "note that the induced polarization increases as the wake formation time decreases .",
    "this is because early wakes have had time to accrete more matter and are thicker than late wakes .",
    "the value of @xmath49 also increases as @xmath46 increases .",
    "this is because the density in a wake is larger at earlier times than later ones . inserting the value of the constants appearing above and evaluating the result in units of the characteristic values",
    "@xmath56 we obtain [ value ] ~ f(t ) g v ( v ) _ b ( ) ^2 ( ) ^3 10 ^ 7 .",
    "the residual ionization fraction drops off after recombination to a value of between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but increases again at the time of reionization to a value of order unity .",
    "however , as can be seen from ( [ value ] ) , the predicted cmb polarization has an amplitude which is suppressed by either @xmath50 for times @xmath13 between recombination and reionization , or by the square of @xmath59 for times after reionization .    in spite of the small amplitude of the signal",
    ", the string - induced polarization may still be detectable because of the specific geometry of the signal in position space : a cosmic string wake leads to a rectangular region in the sky with extra polarization with almost uniform polarization axis and with an amplitude which is increasing monotonically from the leading edge of the wake ( where the string is located ) to the trailing edge ( where the string was at the time of wake formation ) , and because statistically an equal amount of e - mode and b - mode polarization is generated .        in this context ,",
    "i wish to comment on the statement which is often heard that `` b - mode polarization is the holy grail of inflation . ''",
    "what is usually meant by this statement is that b - mode polarization is predicted in inflationary models from the spectrum of gravitational waves which inflation generates .",
    "thus , it is claimed that the detection of b - mode polarization will be a signal of the gravitational waves which inflation predicts .",
    "however , as we have shown above , cosmic strings predict direct b - mode polarization independent of gravitational waves .",
    "thus , it is not correct to interpret a potential detection of b - mode polarization as being due to gravitational waves .",
    "secondly , there are sources of gravitational waves which generically lead to a higher amplitude of such waves than what is obtained in the simplest single field slow - roll inflation models .",
    "specifically , the cosmic string loops which are inevitably produced via the dynamics of the scaling network of long strings will oscillate and decay by emitting gravitational waves .",
    "thus , a detection of gravitational waves ( via b - mode polarization or other means ) is more likely to be a signal of something different from inflation .",
    "there is , in fact , an interesting twist to the story : if b - mode polarization is discovered and shown to be due to gravitational waves , and a blue spectrum ( more power on shorter wavelengths ) is measured , then this would rule out these gravitational waves as being due to inflation . instead , it would be the confirmation of an effect first predicted in the context of superstring theory , namely the spectrum induced in the string gas alternative to inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , b - mode polarization can be viewed as the `` holy grail '' of early universe cosmology , but not as the `` holy grail '' of inflation .",
    "the 21 cm redshift survey technique is emerging as a promising tool to probe cosmology , in particular the high redshift universe , the universe during the  dark ages \" ( i.e. before the onset of star formation ) .",
    "the physics is the following : after the time of recombination but before reionization the baryonic matter in the universe is mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen .",
    "neutral hydrogen has a hyperfine transition line at a frequency corresponding for 21 cm .",
    "if we consider the primordial cmb radiation passing through a gas cloud , then the spectrum at the rest frame frequency of 21 cm is changed by excitation or de - excitation of the hyperfine transition .",
    "the primordial 21 cm photons can be absorbed by the gas cloud . in turn",
    ", a hot gas cloud will emit 21 cm photons . whether the net effect is an absorption or emission effect depends on the temperature of the gas cloud .",
    "any gas cloud which intersects our past light cone at some time between recombination and the present time will yield a 21 cm signal .",
    "if the time of intersection corresponds to a redshift @xmath46 , then the emission / absorption signal will be seen at the redshifted wavelength ( t ) = ( z(t ) + 1 ) _ 0 , where @xmath60 is 21 cm .",
    "hence , 21 cm redshift surveys provide a means for mapping the distribution of baryonic matter as a function of redshift , including at times before the onset of star formation .",
    "cosmic string wakes are nonlinear density perturbations present at arbitrarily early times with a distinctive geometric pattern in position space .",
    "thus , as realized in @xcite , ( see also @xcite for early work on cosmic strings and 21 cm redshift surveys ) , cosmic strings predict striking signals , in particular at redshifts before reionization .",
    "let us begin this section with some basic equations required to compute the 21 cm signal ( see @xcite for a comprehehsive review of 21 cm cosmology ) . let us consider primordial cmb photons passing through a gas cloud at redshift @xmath46 .",
    "then the brightness of the 21 cm radiation emerging from the gas cloud is [ basic1 ] t_b ( ) = t_s ( 1 - e^- _ ) + t _ ( ) e^- _ , where @xmath61 is the  spin temperature \" of the hydrogen atoms in the gas cloud , and @xmath62 is the temperature of the cmb photons before entering the gas cloud .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is the optical depth at the frequency being considered .",
    "the second term in ( [ basic1 ] ) describes the absorption of the primordial cmb photon due to excitation of the hydrogen atoms , the first term gives the contribution due to de - excitation of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the spin temperature introduced above determines the excitation level of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "it is related to the gas temperature in the wake and to the cmb temperature via a collision coefficient @xmath64 : [ basic2 ] t_s = t _ . the relative brightness temperature measured by the observer today is [ basic3 ] t_b ( ) = , where the denominator is due to the redshifting of the temperatures between the time when the gas cloud intersects our past light cone and the present time .",
    "let us now turn to the application to cosmic string wakes .",
    "5 presents a sketch of 21 cm photons from a string wake .",
    "as indicated , there will be a frequency dispersion caused by the different times the photons are emitted .",
    "its magnitude is proportional to the width of the wake and is given by [ freqdisp ] = 2 sin ( ) ( ) h w , where @xmath65 is the hubble expansion rate , @xmath16 is the wake width , and @xmath66 is the angle between the perpendicular to the plane of the wake and the line of sight towards us .    the optical depth for 21 cm photons passing through the wake is ( in units where @xmath67 ) [ optical ] _ = ( ) ( ) , where @xmath68 is the column number density of hydrogen atoms , @xmath69 is the spontaneous emission coefficient of the 21 cm transition , and @xmath70 is the line profile [ line ] ( ) = for [ _ 10 - , _ 10 + ] . note that the width of the string wake ( and hence the dependence on @xmath71 cancels out between the column density and the line profile .",
    "this will lead to the relative brightness temperature signal being independent of the string tension .    to determine the relative brightness temperature",
    ", we also need to know the spin temperature of the hydrogen gas inside the wake .",
    "this is in turn determined ( [ basic2 ] ) from the kinetic temperature of the wake .",
    "assuming that the kinetic temperature is obtained via thermalization from the kinetic energy acquired during the zeldovich collapse of the wake leads to the result @xcite [ waketemp ] t_k [ 20  k ] ( g ) _",
    "6 ^ 2 ( v ( v))^2 , where @xmath72 is the value of @xmath1 in units of @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the redshift of wake formation and @xmath75 is the redshift at which the wake intersects the past light cone .",
    "inserting this result ( [ waketemp ] ) into the expression for the 21 cm brightness temperature ( [ basic1 ] ) yields the following relative brightness temperature t_b ( ) = [ 0.07  k ] ( 1 - ) ( 1 + z)^1/2 whose amplitude is of the order t_b ( ) ~200 mk for , z + 1 = 30 ( we have taken the redshift of emission from the wake to be larger than the redshift of rionization so that we do not have to bother about nonlinearities from the gaussian fluctuations ) .    the amplitude of the cosmic string - induced 21 cm signal is thus very large . whether the signal is in emission or absorption depends on which of @xmath76 or @xmath62 is larger .",
    "in the former case ( low redshifts ) we have an emission signal , in the latter case it is a signal in absorption . is a decreasing function of time , whereas the wake temperature increases for a fixed wake . ]",
    "the transition between emission and absorption takes place when ( g ) _ 6 ^ 2 0.1 ( v ( v))^-2 . for values of @xmath1 which are comparable or lower than the current upper bound , the signal is thus more likely to be in absorption rather than in emission .",
    "wakes formed after the time of recombination @xmath77 intersect the past light cone over a large area in the sky ( comparable or greater to a square degree ) .",
    "each wake will produce a signal in the form of a thin wedge in three dimensional redshift survey space .",
    "the leading edge of the wedge ( where the cosmic string segment is located at the final time ) corresponds to a later time and hence to a frequency which has undergone less frequency redshift .",
    "thus , the two `` large '' dimensions of the wedge are not exactly perpendicular to the frequency axis .",
    "the geometry is illustrated in fig .",
    "the string segment `` lives '' until the time @xmath78 .",
    "its initial position is @xmath79 , its final position @xmath80 .",
    "the string wake extends in comoving coordinates from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "its thickness at @xmath79 vanishes and is maximal at @xmath80 .",
    "the time @xmath55 is the present time .",
    "our past light cone ( indicated by the line labelled @xmath81 ) intersects the string wake . for the configuration shown , the past light cone intersects the leading ( thin ) edge of the wake earlier than the trailing edge .",
    "hence , 21 cm photons from the leading edge are redshifted more than those from the trailing edge .",
    "this gives rise to a characteristic wedge of extra 21 cm absorption / emission due to the string wake in 21 cm redshift maps .",
    "this wedge is sketched on the left of the figure , a sketch in which the horizontal axis is the same comoving spatial coordinate as in the left sketch , and the vertical axis is the detected 21 cm frequency.,height=170 ]    whereas the amplitude of the brightness temperature signal at a fixed point inside the wedge does not depend to a first approximation on @xmath1 , the width of the wedge does depend on it .",
    "the relative width is given by [ freqwidth ] & = & g v_s _ s ( z_i + 1 ) ^1/2 ( z(t ) + 1 ) ^-1/2 + & & 3 10 ^ -5 ( g ) _ 6 v ( v ) , using @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the second line .",
    "hence , an instrument with good frequency resolution is required to be able to measure the cosmic string wake signal at full strength .",
    "if the frequency resolution is worse than the above value , then the wake signal is still detectable , but with a reduced effective brightness .",
    "the analysis presented up to this point has assumed that the initial thermal temperature @xmath84 of the gas is negligible compared to the temperature acquired during infall . for small values of @xmath1",
    "this assumption will fail . in this case the wake will not experience shocks .",
    "the initial thermal velocities will dominate and will lead to a wider but more diffuse wake .",
    "the width in the presence of initial gas temperature compared to the width @xmath85 for @xmath86 is given by @xcite w(t)|_t_k",
    "< t_g = w(t ) |_t_g = 0 .",
    "since the hydrogen column density remains unchanged the temperature at a fixed point in the sky will decrease since the frequency dispersion increases .    in figure 7",
    "we show the brightness temperature excess as a function of @xmath1 for various values of the formation redshift . for large values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the relative brightness temperature is positive . for smaller values",
    ", it is an absorption effect .",
    "the kink point along each curve corresponds to the lowest value of @xmath1 for which there is shock - heating .",
    "the ( brown ) almost horizontal lines on the graph correspond to the pixel by pixel sensitivity of an experiment such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) , with a pixel size optimized as a function of @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we see that the string signal is larger than the predicted noise level for values of @xmath1 substantially smaller than the kink value .    )",
    "correspond to @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the horizontal axis is the value of @xmath1 in units of @xmath73 .",
    "the two brown almost horizontal lines indicate the expected thermal noise per pixel of an experiment such as the ska ( the @xmath1 dependence of the horizontal lines comes from the choice of the optimal pixel size as a function of @xmath1 ( see @xcite).,height=170 ]    since the signal of a string wake has a very special pattern in position space , it is possible to search for this signal even if the relative brightness temperature at a fixed point in the sky is smaller than the pixel noise , in the same way that the line discontinuities caused by string segments in cmb temperature maps can be picked out for values of @xmath1 where the pixel by pixel signal is hidden in the noise . as in the case of cmb temperature maps",
    ", it is important to use position space algorithms to analyze the maps . for an attempt to use minkowski functionals to pick out string signals in 21 cm redshift maps see @xcite .",
    "naturally , it is also possible to compute the power spectrum of the cosmic string wake signal in 21 cm redshift maps . the angular power spectrum at a fixed value of the frequency has been computed in @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to compute the 21 cm signal of a cosmic string loop .",
    "since the overdensity in the region which accretes around the string loop is @xmath48 for a loop compared to @xmath47 for a wake ( contraction occurs in all three dimensions ) , the induced brightness temperature is in fact even larger than for a string wake @xcite .",
    "however , there are no special patterns which allow the string loop signal to be teased apart from background point sources . hence",
    ", we consider it to be more promising to search for the signals of string wakes .",
    "i have discussed the search for cosmic string signals in new observational windows .",
    "there is good motivation for this work : detecting a cosmic string in cosmology would in itself be a great discovery which might lead to the solution of some outstanding problems in cosmology such as the origin of primordial magnetic fields which are coherent on galactic scales . maybe more importantly , searching for cosmic strings in the sky is a way to probe particle physics beyond the standard model at energy scales which can never be reached in terrestrial accelerators .",
    "cosmic strings contribute to structure formation and hence leave imprints in the structure in the universe .",
    "however , the contribution of strings to the total power of cosmological perturbations is already bounded from above to be less than about @xmath89 at the present time .",
    "the bulk of the power comes from almost gaussian primordial fluctuations ( here called gaussian  noise \" ) such as those which could be generated by inflation or its alternatives .",
    "the first main point to take away from this talk is that cosmic strings produce nonlinearities already at very high redshifts ( whereas the gaussian noise does not ) .",
    "hence , the signatures of cosmic strings will be more pronounced at high redshifts .",
    "hence , cmb anisotropy maps and 21 cm redshift surveys are ideal windows to probe for strings .",
    "the second main point is that cosmic strings produce fluctuations which are non - gaussian .",
    "more specifically , string wakes induce signals with specific geometrical patterns in position space .",
    "hence , better limits on cosmic strings can be achieved when analyzing the data in position space ( e.g. with edge detection algorithms ) rather than via power spectra computations .",
    "there are other windows to probe cosmic strings .",
    "one is via gravitational waves .",
    "oscillating cosmic string loops emit gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "a scaling network on strings will produce a scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "cusps on cosmic strings may produce more distinctive signals @xcite .",
    "however , it is expected that back - reaction effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) could greatly reduce the gravitational wave signal of cusps , and hence limits on @xmath1 derived from cusp signals should be taken with lots of grains of doubt .    another window to probe cosmic strings is via high redshift galaxy surveys",
    ". the relative contribution of strings to correlation functions of nonlinear mass concentrations in the universe increases as the redshift grows .",
    "hence , it is interesting to look for signals of cosmic strings in the high redshift galaxy distribution .",
    "quite recently , the contribution of cosmic string loops to galaxy formation at high redshifts has been studied @xcite .",
    "corresponding work on the effects of cosmic string wakes is ongoing at mcgill .",
