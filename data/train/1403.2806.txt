    "titanium has excellent strength to weight ratio , high melting temperature and good corrosion resistance which render it suitable for light - weight , high temperature applications@xcite .",
    "the tensile and fatigue strength of ti increase with oxygen content at the cost of compromising ductility and toughness  @xcite .",
    "these changes in mechanical properties are attributed to the interstitial oxygen atoms impeding dislocation motion and suppressing low temperature twinning  @xcite .",
    "understanding mechanisms underlying this effect of oxygen is thus important from both scientific and industrial points of view .    a recent model developed by oberson _ et  al .",
    "@xcite suggests that twinning in @xmath2-ti is controlled by diffusion of oxygen .",
    "this model is based on the assumption that oxygen would tend to escape away from the twin boundaries due to annihilation of the bulk octahedral sites for interstitials .",
    "however , being purely crystallographic , this model does not account for the details of atomic - scale interaction between the oxygen atom and its surrounding ti neighbors .",
    "despite numerous dft studies of the effect of oxygen on various properties in titanium@xcite , there has yet to be a first - principles study of oxygen interacting with lattice faults in titanium . here",
    ", we investigate such interactions with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations and show that the oxygen atom induces significant relaxations on its nearest neighbor ti atoms , thereby creating new interstitial sites at and around the twin boundary .",
    "our results show that the interstitial sites located at the twin boundary are in fact more energetically favorable for the oxygen atom compared to bulk octahedral sites .",
    "in addition , quantifying the interaction between oxygen interstitials and dislocations in ti is instrumental to understanding the mechanisms of the observed strengthening effect .",
    "previously , we computed the core geometry of screw dislocations in ti using dft and green s function boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "however , calculation of dislocation / oxygen interaction energy requires extra care : periodic boundary conditions create an infinite array of oxygen atoms along the dislocation line , rather than a single , isolated oxygen atom . to approximate the dilute limit , periodicity along the dislocation threading direction",
    "should be increased to a value where the interaction between the solute and its neighboring images is negligible , or at least the _ difference _ in interaction is negligible compared to bulk .",
    "selecting a suitable distance requires calculations of oxygen - oxygen interactions at various separations in bulk ti . here",
    "we present these calculations and show that there is a significant repulsive interaction between the oxygen interstitial and its image at one lattice parameter distance .",
    "we find that to get reasonably small interactions , the distance between periodic images of oxygen atom should be at least twice the lattice parameter if the oxygen is in a bulk octahedral site and even more if it is in a defective site .",
    "therefore , to model the interaction energy between oxygen and the isolated screw dislocation reported in  @xcite , the supercell must contain at least 1864 atoms .",
    "this is extremely expensive for dft calculations .",
    "instead , we compute the interaction energy of the oxygen atom with prismatic stacking faults in ti as a surrogate for the dislocation core and show that oxygen increases the stacking fault energy .",
    "overall , the present study provides various pieces of quantitative information on the interaction of oxygen interstitials with defects in ti and is a first step towards understanding the effect of oxygen on slip and twinning in ti .",
    "_ ab initio _ calculations of oxygen in ti are performed with vasp  @xcite , a plane wave based density functional code using projected augmented wave ( paw ) method within generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "ti 4__s _ _ and 3__d _ _ electrons are considered as valence electrons . a planewave energy cut - off of 500 ev is used throughout the calculations . a k - points mesh of 16@xmath316@xmath312",
    "is used for a ti unit cell and is adjusted for each geometry accordingly .",
    "table  [ tab : compare ] compares the lattice and elastic constants and planar fault energies obtained from paw , ultra - soft pseudo potentials ( uspp ) with _ p _ electrons treated as valence and experiments .",
    "lattice parameters and twin boundary energies from paw and uspp are almost identical .",
    "the elastic constants differ within 12@xmath4 and the prismatic stacking fault energy is approximately 20@xmath4 higher for uspp .",
    "both paw and uspp agree well with experiments .",
    ".comparison of lattice and elastic constants and planar fault energies for paw with uspp and experiments .",
    "the elastic constants are in gpa , and the two fault energies@xmath0 twin boundary ( tb ) and @xmath1 prismatic stacking fault ( sf)are given in j / m@xmath5 . [",

    "we studied the energetics of oxygen interstitial interactions with @xmath0 twin boundary and a prismatic @xmath1 stacking fault .",
    "four interstitial sites in the twin geometry are compared with the bulk octahedral site .",
    "we show that two of these sites located at the twin boundary are more attractive to oxygen than bulk while the sites away from the boundary are repulsive .",
    "in addition , we compared the oxygen - oxygen pair interactions at each site for different distances between periodic images of the oxygen atom .",
    "we observed that oxygen pairs repel / attract each other when separated by a single lattice parameter at the bulk / twin boundary site .",
    "moreover , we study the interaction of oxygen with the prismatic stacking fault to approximate oxygen - dislocation interaction .",
    "we show that oxygen increases the stacking fault energy and therefore is repelled by the faulted geometry and consequently a dislocation core .",
    "our results provide various pieces of quantitative information on the interaction of oxygen interstitials with defects in ti ; oxygen / twin boundary interaction energies reveal the existence of attractive sites at the twin boundary .",
    "this highlights the fact that atomic - scale features of oxygen / ti interaction , which is lost in purely crystallographic models , are essential and should be considered .",
    "moreover , the difference in first - neighbor interaction between oxygen atoms suggests that the repulsion is not a simple elastic repulsion , but depends strongly on the local configuration of neighboring titanium atoms . to obtain the complete picture of thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen around the twin boundary",
    ", further calculations of the energy barriers for oxygen diffusion between various interstitial sites around the twin boundary should be performed .",
    "moreover , computation of the interaction energy between pairs of oxygen atoms at various separations are essential in any oxygen / defect simulations involving periodic boundary conditions . based on these calculations we conclude that direct dft simulations of dislocation / oxygen interactions require at least @xmath6 periodic lengths along the dislocation threading direction .",
