    "ir bright activity and in particular ulirg activity is triggered by interactions between gas - rich galaxies that merge , go through an optical quasar phase and eventually evolve into elliptical galaxies ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations predict that during the merger phase both intense star formation and a dust enshrouded active galactic nucleus ( agn ) phase co - exist in the dusty nuclear regions of most ulirgs before energetic feedback from an agn and/or star formation clears the nuclear region of gas and dust ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "plenty of observations now support this scenario at least in terms of the agn detection rate and increased agn bolometric contribution to the system luminosity with increasing ir luminosity for local luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , with ir luminosities @xmath11 ) and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable effort devoted to understanding the relation between the ir luminosity and the morphology , merger state , star formation rate and agn dominance of ulirgs and how all these properties relate to those of optical quasars . in particular , using _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) spectroscopic observations,@xcite showed that ulirgs do not seem to follow a simple evolutionary path to optical quasars , either in terms of the agn bolometric dominance or the eddington ratios .",
    "moreover , @xcite based on the same data set proposed that the lifecycle of local ulirgs consists of three phases with the first one during pre - coalescence being dominated by star formation activity .",
    "the subsequent final evolution of the ulirg may or may not go through a quasar phase depending on the properties of the progenitor galaxies .",
    "for quasars , @xcite proposed an evolutionary sequence which is driven by the geometry of the dust in their nuclear regions to explain the variety of observed optical and ir spectral indices .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in section  [ sec : evolution ] we will investigate further the possible evolutionary connection between ir - bright galaxies and quasars and the interaction stage of the agn mid - ir emission .",
    "in this section we use the @xmath4 m pah feature emission to study the star formation activity in the nuclear regions of the ir - bright galaxy sample . of the 13 ir - bright nuclei",
    "where the ground - based spectral range allowed measurements , we detected the @xmath4 m pah feature ( with a detection significance better than @xmath12 ) in 7 of them ( see table  [ tab : measurepah ] ) .",
    "the nuclear values of the ew of the @xmath4 m pah feature for most of the nuclei in the ir - bright galaxy sample are below the typical values of star forming galaxies ( @xmath13 m , see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because of the increased agn fractional contribution at @xmath14 m when using high angular resolution data . for the @xmath4 m pah",
    "non - detections there still can be a small contribution from star formation activity in the nuclear region .",
    "our upper limits show that sources with undetected @xmath4 m pah features could still have @xmath4 m pah luminosities of a few @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that detecting pah emission may be difficult when the agn continuum dominates the emission at @xmath14 m unless the spectrum has a high s / n ratio . in galaxies with deep silicate features ( e.g. , iras  08572 + 3915n in our sample ) it is possible that the @xmath4 m pah emission is obscured by the same foreground absorber that obscures the agn continuum ( see also discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "in fact for iras  08572 + 3915n , the 100% agn contribution in the mid - ir is because this galaxy is fitted with an `` obscured agn '' template which might be suffering from the same effect .    since we also measured the @xmath4 m pah feature in the _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectra , we computed the ratios between the nuclear and the irs @xmath4 m pah luminosities ( fifth column of table  [ tab : measurepah ] ) .",
    "the ratios for the ir - bright galaxy sample indicate that there is a large fraction with extended pah emission from the nuclear physical scales probed with the ground - based data ( hundreds of parsecs ) to the few kpc scales probed by the irs slit .",
    "the two nuclei in the ir - bright galaxy sample with the most extended @xmath4 m pah emission ( nuclear to irs ratios of 0.08 and @xmath16 ) are the two components of arp  299 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : arp299 ] ) , as also revealed by the deep gtc / canaricam imaging at @xmath17 m with the si-2 filterm pah feature , see figure  4 of @xcite . ] .",
    "the rest have ratios of between 0.1 and 0.5 .",
    "for the nuclear spectra with only upper limits to the @xmath4 m pah feature ratios are consistent with compact emission ( ratios @xmath18 ) .",
    "for the 5 ir - weak quasars where the ground based spectra covered the @xmath4 m pah feature ( see table  [ tab : measurepah ] ) , we only detected the feature in mrk  509 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) with an ew of @xmath19 m .",
    "this lack of detections is not surprising as the ew of the @xmath4 m pah feature measured from the _ spitzer_/irs spectra for the pg quasars in our sample are in the range @xmath20 m for mrk  509 and @xmath21 m for mrk  335 .",
    "the @xmath4 m pah feature of pg0804 + 761 remained undetected even in the irs spectrum .",
    "since the ground - based slits are about @xmath22 times narrower than the irs sl one , higher agn contributions within the smaller slits would produce even smaller ew of the pah features .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : measurepah ] , three quasars have formally nuclear upper limits to the @xmath4 m pah fluxes larger than the irs one due to the s / n ratio of the canaricam spectra . clearly , the nuclear to irs ratios have to be lower than one .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzervscanaricamlpah ] we plot the nuclear @xmath4 m pah feature luminosities from ground - based data against those measured from the _ spitzer_/irs spectra for the ir - bright galaxy sample . from the slit widths and angular resolution we estimate that if the emission was uniformly distributed we would expect a ratio between the two luminosities for the gtc / canaricam spectra of approximately 50 . in this figure , for ngc  1614 we plot the nuclear ( central @xmath23pc ) @xmath4 m pah luminosity estimated by @xcite rather than our @xmath24 extraction , which leads to a nuclear to irs ratio of approximately 0.1 .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the @xmath4 m pah emission of the majority of the ir - bright galaxies while extended over several kpc is not uniformly distributed .",
    "it does not appear to be very compact either ( approximately ratios of less than a few tenths ) , except perhaps for some of nuclei with nuclear upper limits and ngc  6240s .",
    "if the @xmath4 m pah emission traces the recent star formation activity in ir - bright galaxies , this indicates that star formation is extended over several kiloparsecs and not taking place uniformly distributed .",

    "* ) we find nuclear ( not corrected for extinction ) sfrm pah features using pahfit instead of a local continuum near the feature as in our work ( section  [ sec : measurepah ] ) .",
    "the pahfit fluxes are on average twice those measured with a local continuum ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we therefore multiplied our @xmath4 m pah luminosities by this factor when deriving the nuclear sfrs .",
    "] for the nuclei of ir - bright galaxies ( see table  [ tab : measurepah ] ) between @xmath27 for ic  694 and @xmath28 for ngc  6240s assuming an initial mass function similar to that of @xcite",
    ". taking into account the physical sizes covered by the ground - based slits , these translate into nuclear sfr per unit area between @xmath29 for iras  17208@xmath300014 and @xmath31 for ngc  6240s .",
    "these values are typical of the nuclear values derived by @xcite for a sample of local ( u)lirgs based on extinction - corrected pa@xmath32 or br@xmath33 luminosities .",
    "taking into account the estimated nuclear sfr per unit area in our sample of ir - bright galaxies and the agn contributions to the nuclear emission , we suggest that ngc  1614 , ic  694 and ngc  6240s would be potentially good candidates for starburst - driven powerful outflows based on the observed correlation between sfr per unit area and outflow velocity @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite have confirmed the presence of starburst - driven outflows in the southern nucleus of ngc  6240 and the nuclear region of ngc  1614 , respectively , using molecular gas data .",
    "in this section we look for evidence for an evolution of the obscuring material around the agn between the ir - bright galaxies , ir - bright quasars and ir - weak quasars .",
    "to do so , we use the derived mid - ir agn properties , namely , the spectral index , the strength of the silicate feature , and the fractional contribution to the mid - ir emission . with regards to the agn properties , @xcite predicted an evolutionary change of the mid - ir slope toward flatter indices from `` warm '' ulirgs ( those dominated by agn emission ) to young quasars , evolved quasars and finally dead quasars .",
    "`` cool '' ulirgs , even those hosting an agn , are dominated by star formation , and emit most of their energy in the far - ir . in `` cool '' and `` warm '' ulirg systems",
    "the dust is distributed in a more spherical configuration and as the system evolves to a quasar the dust distribution is predicted to develop a disk or torus - like configuration . from their figure  12",
    "we can see that their predictions for the shape of the ir emission encompasses physical scales of less than 1kpc which compare well with the physical sizes probed by our ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , in the context of the predictions from clumpy torus models the mid - ir slope and the strength of the silicate feature provide information about the radial distribution of the clouds and the number of clouds along the equatorial direction in the torus @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : midiralphavsssil ] compares the agn mid - ir spectral index to the agn strength of the silicate feature for the ir - bright galaxies and quasars as derived with deblendirs .",
    "the sources are color - coded by the fractional agn contribution at @xmath14 m and the ir - bright galaxies are shown with their interaction class given in table  [ tab : sampleulirg ] .",
    "most of the ir - weak quasar sample and the ir - bright quasars ( the latter recognised as having high agn fractional contributions and iv or v morphologies ) are located in the region around @xmath34 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison_nucsep_irratio ] ) but span the same range of mid - ir spectral indices as the rest of the ir - bright galaxy sample .",
    "this indicates that in general the nuclear mid - ir emission of type 1 quasars can be explained with tori with a relatively low number of clouds along the equatorial direction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed modeling of the nuclear ir emission of pg quasars ) .",
    "as we also showed in section  [ sec : agnalphassil ] for the combined pdf of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the shapes of the agn mid - ir emission of ir - bright and ir - weak quasars do not differ significantly ( see also fig.[fig : agnbestspectra ] ) .",
    "this seems to imply that the predicted evolution of the dust distribution around these two types of quasars is taking place in short time scales which can not be resolved with our data .",
    "this agrees with the observational result that red quasars make up only @xmath37 of the quasar population ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , our classification between ir - bright and ir - weak quasars is based on the ir to optical ratios which is likely reflecting different levels of star formation activity in their host galaxies as their far - ir emission is dominated by this process @xcite . finally , as discussed in section  [ sec : sample ] , our sample of quasars is likely mid - ir bright and thus it is possible we are missing more evolved quasars with different mid - ir spectral shapes .",
    "one exception in this mid - ir view might be the transition quasar mrk  231 in our sample whose agn silicate feature is intermediate between those of non - agn dominated ir - bright galaxies and quasars suggesting the presence of extra dust components . in mrk  231 , the nuclear silicate feature ( measured on physical scales of @xmath38400pc ) would indicate an extinction of @xmath39mag , using a foreground dust screen , which is compatible with the value derived by @xcite for the obscuration of the broad absorption line region through which the broad line region is observed .",
    "the agn in the other two candidates to buried quasars ( mrk  463e and iras  08572 + 3915n ) have strengths of the silicate features which are not compatible with those measured in optically identified quasars , with iras  08572 + 3915n showing in fact the most extreme absorption feature in our sample of ir - bright galaxies and in general the local ( u)lirg population @xcite .",
    "these three quasars could be perhaps just before the blowout phase of the quasar evolution @xcite .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : midiralphavsssil ] , a large fraction of non - quasar ir - bright galaxies ( 8 out of 10 ) occupy a different region from that of the quasars , especially in terms of the silicate feature as we saw from the combined pdfs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : combinedpdf ] ) .",
    "there is no clear trend of the agn @xmath40 m spectral index with the agn fractional contribution for the ir - bright galaxy sample ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison_nucsep_irratio ] , lower right panel ) . this would be expected if the agn fractional contribution were to give an indication of the evolutionary stage of the agn . on the other hand",
    ", there is a tendency for the agn component of ir - bright galaxy nuclei with low ( @xmath41 ) agn fractional contributions to the total ir luminosity of the system to show deeper silicate features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_nucsep_irratio ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "these have a mean value of @xmath42 , whereas the nuclei with agn fractional contributions above 10% have a mean value of @xmath43 .",
    "this is similar to the trend found by @xcite for hii - like optically classified ulirgs to have deeper silicate features .",
    "as pointed out by many works @xcite , deep silicate features ( @xmath44 ) can not be reproduced by clumpy torus models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating either extended dust components in the host galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or deeply embedded sources in more spherical configurations .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite evolutionary prediction of a more embedded dust distribution surrounding the agn for the `` cool '' ( i.e. , star formation dominated ) ulirg phase .",
    "we do not find any clear trends of the agn mid - ir properties in terms of the interaction stage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : midiralphavsssil ] ) or the projected nuclear separation ( see the upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : comparison_nucsep_irratio ] ) .",
    "for instance , the three agn in the ir - bright galaxy sample with the deepest silicate features are in interacting galaxies which are not fully merged ( that is classified as iiib , with projected nuclear separations between the individual nuclei of less than 10kpc ) .",
    "however , the lirg ngc  7469 ( not plotted here ) , which is classified as iiia ( its companion is ic  5283 , located at a projected distance greater than 10kpc ) has an agn silicate feature flat or slightly in emission @xcite , which is similar to the values measured in the ( fully merged ) quasars in our sample and other seyfert 1 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the other non - quasar ir bright nuclei whose agn is fitted with a deep silicate feature is ugc  5101 which is believed to be fully merged .",
    "in summary , since the agn mid - ir spectral index and the silicate feature trace the properties of the obscuring material around the agn ( approximately the radial distribution of clouds and number of clouds in the context of the clumpy dusty torus , respectively , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the only clear trend is for both ir bright ir - weak quasars to show less obscuration than the rest of the nuclei in the ir - bright galaxy sample which tend to have lower agn fractional contributions .",
    "we find no apparent relationship of these properties with the interaction class of the host galaxy or the projected nuclear separation between the nuclei .",
    "this confirms that there is not a single evolutionary path for the local ir - bright galaxies into agn dominated systems , as already discussed in previous works @xcite .      in the last part of this work we investigate the relation between the nuclear star formation activity and the agn luminosity for our sample of local ir - bright galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations for major gas - rich mergers @xcite predict a relation between these two quantities with the correlation becoming more tightly coupled on smaller physical scales @xcite .",
    "however , dynamical delays between the peaks of star formation activity and agn activity are also predicted and are also a function of the physical scales where the star formation is measured @xcite . from the observational point of view",
    "this correlation has been observed for local seyferts in the shapley - ames ( rsa ) sample for nuclear sfr measured on circumnuclear scales ( radius of @xmath45kpc , * ? ? ? * ) and on 100-pc nuclear scales @xcite .",
    "also @xcite found a similar correlation for pg quasars using the @xmath46 m pah feature as measured from _",

    "* and references therein ) and nuclear sfr , respectively , for our ir - bright galaxy and quasar samples . given the distances of the ir - bright galaxies and quasars in our sample the ground - based mid - ir spectroscopy probes physical scales of a few hundred parsecs ( see table  [ tab : measurepah ] ) .",
    "for the nearest lirg in our sample , arp  299 , instead of the ground - based mid - ir pah luminosities we show the _",
    "spitzer_/irs one which probes physical scales of approximately 700pc .    for a subset of seyferts in the rsa sample",
    ", @xcite showed that on nuclear scales ( median of 60pc ) there is a nearly linear relation ( with a 0.4dex scatter ) between the sfr ( calculated from the @xmath4 m pah luminosity ) and the black hole accretion rate ( derived from the agn bolometric luminosity ) .",
    "the rsa seyferts are drawn from a magnitude - limited catalog of galaxies and considered to be one of the least biased samples of local agn . as a comparison we included in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagnvslpah ] those rsa seyferts for which , depending on their distance , the ground - based or the _",
    "spitzer_/irs slits cover physical regions of a few hundred parsecs , as in our samples .",
    "we note that quasar mrk  509 is also part of the rsa seyfert sample .",
    "since most of the rsa seyferts are not currently experiencing major merger processes , we can use them to define the locus of _ normal agn _ ( in the sense of their activity being driven probably by more secular processes ) in the plot showing the agn luminosity ( that is , black hole accretion rate ) and the nuclear @xmath4 m pah luminosity ( nuclear star formation rate ) .",
    "we plot this locus as a linear relation with a @xmath47dex scatter , similar to the scatter measured on @xmath45kpc scales , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lagnvslpah ] , the quasars ( both ir - bright and ir - weak ) lie at the high luminosity end of this locus defined by the rsa seyferts and are compatible with or lie just below the relation found for lower luminosity agn .",
    "this may suggest that in some quasars the nuclear star formation activity is already dimming as predicted by numerical simulations . some of the other ir - bright galaxy nuclei ( e.g. , ic  694 , ngc  1614 , ngc  6240n , iras  17208@xmath300014 ) on the other hand , tend to show enhanced nuclear star formation when compared to _",

    "this suggests they are in an earlier phase of the agn evolution when star formation dominates the energetics of the system .",
    "note that @xcite reached a similar conclusion for a sample of local lirgs at lower ir luminosities .",

    "the evolutionary connection between ir - bright galaxies associated with gas - rich mergers and quasars was proposed nearly thirty years ago .",

    "we took advantage of the high angular resolution ( 0.3 - 0.4arcsec ) afforded by mid - ir instruments on 8 - 10m - class telescopes to study nuclear physical scales of hundreds of parsecs in both samples with an improvement of almost a factor of 10 with respect to _ spitzer_/irs .",
    "this allows us to probe nuclear scales where the black hole growth and star formation activity are believed to be more tightly coupled .    using the deblendirs spectral decomposition tool we isolated the mid - ir emission due to dust heated by the agn from that due to nuclear star formation for both samples .",
    "this allowed us to derive agn mid - ir properties such as , the @xmath40 m spectral index ( @xmath36 ) , the strength of the @xmath49 m silicate feature ( @xmath35 ) , and the agn rest - frame @xmath14 m monochromatic luminosities , which provide information about the nuclear dust distribution and the agn contribution to the ir luminosity .",

    "even though deblendirs was initially designed to perform the spectral decomposition of _",

    "we only needed to change the spectral range in the deblendirs configuration file to reflect that covered by the ground - based data .",
    "additionally , from the list of agn templates we removed those in our sample selected as such ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",

    "[ fig : examplesdeblendirs ] examples of the deblendirs graphical output of the spectral decomposition of the gtc / canaricam spectra of two ir - bright galaxy nuclei in our sample , one dominated by the agn emission ( mrk  463e ) and one dominated by star - formation ( iras  17208@xmath300014 ) .        in section",
    "[ sec : deblendirs ] we remarked that based on the reduced @xmath61 values , the majority of the ground - based spectra of the ir - bright galaxies and the quasars were well fitted with deblendirs using irs templates .",
    "however , there are a few cases with relatively high @xmath61 values so we need to determine if this is due to the lack of appropriate spectral templates in the deblendirs database to fit deep silicate features . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisonchisquaressil ] we plot the reduced @xmath61 value of the best fit against the derived strength of the silicate feature of the agn component .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , there is a tendency for worsening @xmath61 for deeper silicate features cod nuclei with @xmath62 having the deepest silicate feature ( @xmath63 )",
    ". this might be in part due to the limited number of `` obscured agn '' templates ( 22 ) in the deblendirs database versus the rest of `` bonafide agn '' templates ( 159 , see * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "also , the @xmath61 value does not only depend on the appropriateness of the templates but also the s / n ratio of the spectra .    in objects with very deep",
    "silicate absorption features , the flux near the silicate minimum at @xmath49 m is very weak and can be a factor of @xmath1100 lower than in the wings at 8 and @xmath64 m .",
    "the larger irs aperture may admit substantially more diffuse emission from the host galaxy than the slits of the ground - based instruments , which can partially fill in the silicate absorption minimum and change the shape of the apparent silicate profile .",
    "this effect can be seen in the comparison of the irs and ground - based trecs spectra of ngc  4418 in @xcite , where the absorption feature in the irs spectrum is broader than the profile measured with the ground - based instrument trecs because contributions from extra - nuclear emission flatten the minimum and broaden the wings of the silicate profile whilst enhancing the pah emission .",
    "the same effects can be seen in the fit to iras  08572 + 3915n in fig .",
    "[ fig : deepsilicatesanddeblendirs ] . as more and higher quality",
    "ground - based spectra become available , it may be possible to employ them as templates , but the broader wavelength coverage available from space missions would not be available . in the same figure",
    "we also show the other two ir - bright nuclei whose fits have @xmath65 .",
    "ic  694 might suffer from the same problem with the silicate feature as iras  08572 + 3915n but it is not as extreme .",
    "also the high value of @xmath61 is due to the relatively poor fits of the pah features . in any case",
    ", both nuclei have small @xmath66 uncertainties in the derived agn @xmath35 value due the above mentioned small number of `` obscured agn '' templates . for ngc  6240s",
    "the high value of @xmath61 is likley caused by a bad atmospheric correction around @xmath67 m and at the edges of the spectrum .",
    "we conclude that for most objects in our sample the irs templates are appropriate for the spectral decomposition of the nuclear mid - ir spectra .",
    "uncertainties and the reduced @xmath61 value of the best fit obtained with deblendirs for the ground - based data .",
    "the star symbols are the ir - weak quasars , whereas the circles are the ir - bright galaxies ( including the ir - bright quasars ) . ]",
    "in this appendix we compare the agn @xmath40 m spectral index @xmath36 and the strength of the silicate feature @xmath35 derived with deblendirs using _",
    "spitzer_/irs sl spectroscopy ( 3.7arcsec slit width ) and high - angular resolution ground - based spectroscopy ( slit widths between 0.52 and 0.75arcsec ) for the samples of ir - bright galaxies and quasars . as done for the ground - based data , for the _ spitzer_/irs spectra we only fitted the approximate spectral range @xmath68 m with deblendirs .",
