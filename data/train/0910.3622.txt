    "schrdinger s cat paradox  @xcite emphasizes how basic quantum concepts such as superposition that are routinely applied and accepted in the microscopic description of matter appear to contradict basic human experience when augmented to a macroscopic scale .",
    "quantum mechanics does not itself provide any intrinsic size limitation , i.e. , it does not predict a critical number of particles at which such superpositions would be impossible .",
    "yet there still remain questions as to whether there are emergent limitations at some length scale between the micro- and macroscopic , or even whether extraneous factors limit the size of superpositions .",
    "this question is fundamentally unresolved  @xcite .",
    "hints towards an answer would be given by experiments that realize truly macroscopic superpositions , which would provide evidence against macroscopic realism  @xcite .",
    "there are numerous experiments attempting to produce such macroscopic superposition states in a variety of different physical systems  @xcite . yet determining the actual size of these states ( sometimes referred to as schrdinger s",
    "cattiness  @xcite ) is a non - trivial theoretical question that needs to be solved in tandem with the experimental realizations .",
    "this includes three aspects .",
    "first , one must ascertain or specify which types of degrees of freedom participate in the superposition , and which are irrelevant .",
    "for example , trapped ions in a superposition state of internal degrees of freedom interact with the motional degrees of freedom in the ion trap , yet these would not be included in a superposition size measure for the internal states .",
    "more generally , degrees of freedom that are not accessible in a particular experimental realization , e.g. , because of too high energy , are not included .",
    "thus in a low - temperature experiment one would not determine the superposition size in terms of quarks .",
    "second , once it is agreed which elementary constituents are involved , one needs to determine what is the actual number of particles or modes that participate in the superposition , in the sense of being in distinguishably different states in the branches of the superposition .",
    "the latter can be a highly non - trivial calculation for an interacting quantum system .",
    "third , it is important to then assess this number in the context of the observable and controllable physical parameters of the superposition state .",
    "one attractive candidate system in this program is the superconducting flux qubit .",
    "flux qubits are composed of superconducting loops of between one and many micrometres , that contain one or more josephson junctions",
    ". they can realize superpositions of states of a macroscopic electrodynamic variable , the circulating current and its concomitant magnetic flux , attributable to @xmath2-@xmath1 electrons  @xcite .",
    "superpositions of the form @xmath3",
    "@xcite and coherent oscillations between these states have both been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , even though many particles are involved and the fluxes are macroscopically distinct in the two branches of the superposition , it does not necessarily follow that the actual _ size _ of the state , i.e. , the number of particles that are in superposition in the sense of being in different states in the two branches , is macroscopic as well .",
    "furthermore , this size can not be determined from the engineering of these experiments , for which the macroscopic electrodynamic variables are sufficient  @xcite .",
    "finally , a microscopic calculation has to carefully take into account that the superconducting states is composed of ( paired ) electrons .",
    "because of their fermion nature , these always occupy a finite volume in momentum space ( unlike bosons )",
    ". moreover , they are indistinguishable .",
    "it is thus important to devise a measure that does not assume distinguishable electrons and that correctly takes both the indistinguishability and fermion statistics of the electrons into account .",
    "theoretical estimates have come to vastly different proposals for this size , reflecting their different underlying assumptions : i ) counting all electrons of cooper pairs in the supercurrent gives a size of 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5  @xcite , which is at least mesoscopic , if not approaching macroscopic sizes , ii ) analyzing the number of electrodynamic charge states within the macroscopic , circuit hamiltonian approach leads to a trivial effective size of 1 - 2  @xcite .",
    "however , neither of these approaches is fullly microscopic in the sense of characterizing the interacting electron system in the superconducting loop .",
    "here we place a bound on a broad range of microscopic measures of superposition size by asking the following direct question : how many electrons behave distinguishably differently in the two branches @xmath6 and @xmath7 ? we first outline the microscopic analysis of the superposition state that is necessary to estimate this quantity and then we present the bound for electrons in superpositions of flux states .",
    "this bound derives from an operational measure for superposition size that is determined by the degree of distinguishability of the two branches by an @xmath8-particle measurement  @xcite .",
    "we will show that for all experimentally realistic flux qubits , this bound results in an estimate of superposition state size that is considerably smaller than the number of electrons carrying the supercurrent but that is also significantly larger than the trivial size of 1 - 2 estimated from the macroscopic description .",
    "our microscopic analysis reveals that the fermi statistics play a critical role in reducing the number of electronic degrees of freedom that participate in the quantum superposition to well below simple estimates of the number of current carrying electrons .",
    "we further discuss the questions raised by such an estimate of size in terms of microscopic constituents , for a system whose macroscopic behavior can also be fully described by a single collective variable .",
    "in this section we outline the analysis performed to connect the full microscopic description of the system , starting from the hamiltonian of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) , to its macroscopic state and show how to compute microscopic quantities such as density matrices and correlation functions in that state .",

    "@xcite , this approach of estimating an  extensive difference  between the branches is too simplistic .",
    "for example , the superposition of a single neutron going two ways through an interferometer involves a huge difference in both center - of - mass position and angular momentum around the center of the interferometer compared to atomic scales , yet still involves only a single neutron and would clearly not be considered a macroscopic superposition state  @xcite .",
    "similarly , for superposition states of flow , e.g. , in flux qubits , merely comparing the difference in magnetic moment @xmath110 between the branches @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the magnitude of the bohr magneton @xmath111 can yield the same value @xmath112 for very different @xmath8 particle states . for example , neglecting electron indistinguishability , a state in which @xmath8 electrons are in orthogonal states in the two branches , each having the same angular momentum difference @xmath113 , results in the same @xmath110 as a state in which a single high energy electron carries the equivalent total angular momentum difference @xmath114 while all other electrons behave identically in both branches .",
    "only the former case involves @xmath8 electrons behaving distinguishably differently in the two branches and would be acceptable as a superposition state of size @xmath8 : in the latter case only a single electron behaves differently and this is clearly a superposition state of size unity .",
    "however , for electronic states of flow , we also have to take into account the fact that electrons are themselves indistinguishable , with fermi statistics .",
    "this further complicates the analysis , requiring an accounting of how many electronic _ modes _ behave differently in the two branches , i.e. , have different occupation numbers , rather than how many _ individual particles _ behave differently .",
    "this example suggests that in addition to differences between macroscopic variables , one needs to i ) consider also the number of microscopic constituents that are behaving differently in the two branches when defining the effective size of a many - body superposition state , and ii ) take the fundamental particle statistics into account when defining these microscopic constituents .",
    "since electrons satisfy fermi statistics , the correct microscopic constituents for analysis of superposition states in flux qubits are modes of electron momentum , occupation of which can be different in the two branches .",
    "several possible definitions have been put forward for a superposition size measure based on analysis of microscopic degrees of freedom  @xcite . while all of these are hard to calculate for complex many - body states such as the electron states constituting a flux qubit , the distinguishability measure developed by two of us in ref .",
    "@xcite admits an upper bound that can be calculated using the microscopic functional integral formalism described above .",
    "the distinguishability measure is an operational measure that asks what is the largest number of subsets of elementary constitutents such that measuring all constituents in any one subset causes the superposition to collapse to one branch with some specified probability .",
    "this problem is equivalent to that of determining the minimum number of microscopic constituents that have to be measured in order to distinguish the two branches to some specified precision .",
    "@xcite showed that this leads to a superposition size of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the first value for which the probability of successfully distinguishing the branches is larger than @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the desired precision .",

    "any measure that gives a larger number than this must be counting electrons that are in identical states in the two branches and are therefore not actively contributing to the superposition . since our measure is based on a measurement , it is desirable ( although , just as in a gedanken experiment , not essential for theoretical evaluation of the superposition size ) that the assumed experiment is , in principle , feasible .",

    "a cooper pair mode accommodating two cooper paired electrons with intrinsic momenta and spins @xmath151 and @xmath152 is defined by the two - electron creation operator @xmath153 .",

    "hence @xmath160 and so whether two modes are coupled or not will in principle depend on the superfluid velocity .",
    "this can lead to a change in mode definitions between the two circulating current states that complicates the calculation of mode occupation number difference .",
    "however , since for the experimental systems @xmath161 is much smaller than the momentum - space difference between distinct modes , this mismatch can be treated perturbatively .",
    "detailed analysis shows that if the laboratory frame modes are not perfectly correlated , i.e. , @xmath162 for the value of @xmath62 in either of the branches , there can be only a second - order dependence on @xmath62 , while if they are perfectly correlated , i.e. , @xmath163 in one branch , a first order contribution can result  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the maximum value of this first order contribution is exactly the same as that obtained from the single electron mode occupation number difference , i.e. , @xmath164 .",

    "more importantly for the present discussion , this result implies that analysis of the branch occupation number difference of cooper pair ( two - electron ) modes yields exactly the same effective superposition size as that obtained from analysis of the branch occupation number difference of single electron modes .",
    "we now use the single electron mode analysis to derive an expression for the branch occupation number difference and hence an upper bound on the effective superposition size in terms of experimentally measured quantities .",

    ", we first briefly summarize the possible contributions from tunneling through the junction and the effect of scattering from impurities .",
    "the estimates in table  [ tbl : experimentsandeffectivecatsizes ] include only the effect of different circulating currents in the two branches of the superposition .",
    "this is the only contribution in the bulk of the superconductor , far from any junctions and where the tunneling contribution to the green s function @xmath94 is negligible .",
    "however close to the junction , @xmath103 is not negligible and electron tunneling through the junction can then also contribute to the difference in mode occupation in the two branches of the superposition .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that close to the junction up to a depth of order @xmath196 , the cooper pairs will be in superposition between both sides of the junction , rather than being described by rigid , directional superflow .",
    "this gives rise to an additional contribution to the superposition size when the modes are measured close to the junction .",
    "detailed analysis of this using the form of @xmath103 given in section  [ ch : corr ] ( i.e. , neglecting the superfluid contribution here ) leads to a mode occupation difference of  @xcite @xmath197 evaluation of this quantity assuming momentum conservation during tunneling and using the parameters of the main tunnel junction in the delft squid  @xcite leads to the following estimate for the tunneling contribution to the occupation number difference close to the junction @xmath198 which is the same order of magnitude as the number of electrons changing modes in the bulk of the flux loop for this qubit ( second row in table  [ tbl : experimentsandeffectivecatsizes ] ) .",
    "thus the tunneling dynamics of electrons close to the junction do not significantly alter the overall superposition size estimates made from microscopic consideration of the current carrying electrons in the bulk superconductor - both yield the same order of magnitude .",
    "note , that while these contributions are in general _ not _ simply additive , if the range of tunneling is restricted to the vicinity of the junction , however , then adding them does provides a reasonable bound on the total superposition size that consistently includes both bulk and tunneling electron contributions .",
    "the analysis above has addressed ballistic superconductors at @xmath199 .",
    "we now consider the effect of impurities and defects on these calculations of cat size in terms of the number of participating microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "first , we note that while superconductors may in general be subject to inelastic effects from magnetic impurities , their concentration in modern nanofabricated samples is , however , extremely low , to the extent that there are no impurity - induced states in the gap , the density of states is perfectly bcs - like  @xcite and the dephasing times of flux qubits  @xcite are longer than expected in the presence of many magnetic impurities  @xcite . however , the superconductor may still be dirty by virtue of elastic scattering of the cooper pair electrons from impurities , which is likely due to the polycrystalline nature of an evaporated superconducting film .",
    "this results in typical diffusion constants of order @xmath200 m@xmath201/s , corresponding to a mean free path @xmath202 m , which may be shorter than the coherence length @xmath203 .",
    "we now consider how this scattering affects the mode occupation number difference @xmath128 in the dirty limit where @xmath204 ( @xmath205 m in al and @xmath206 m in nb ) .",
    "we need to analyze how the green s function @xmath207 is modified by elastic scattering from impurities .",
    "we shall restrict our discussion here to the bulk contribution , @xmath208 and not consider the tunneling contribution .",
    "tunneling influences the green s functions over a length corresponding to the appropriate dirty - limit coherence length @xmath209  @xcite , which is necessarily smaller than @xmath210 in this limit .",
    "thus , we expect a smaller tunneling contribution than in the ballistic case . for weak scattering ,",
    "the modified bulk green s function can be analyzed using the dyson expansion @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the electron - impurity interaction .",
    "expanding as before in the small parameter @xmath141 leads to a zeroth order term @xmath213 and a first order term @xmath214 .",
    "we take the electron - impurity interaction @xmath212 to be defined by @xmath215 where the sum goes over all impurities in the superconducting loop .",
    "the modified green s functions may then be evaluated using the explicit solution for the zeroth order green s function , @xmath216 \\",

    "thus , to first order in the superfluid velocity and the electron - impurity interaction , elastic scattering from impurities has no effect on the single electron green s function and hence no effect on our estimate of the effective superposition size .",
    "while higher order terms in the dyson expansion may also give rise to contributions that are first order in @xmath62 , a more complete analysis based on quasiclassical green s function  @xcite shows that these conclusions are independent of the impurity concentration as long as @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the fermi wavelength .",
    "the latter can always be assumed , because @xmath219 would put the material close to the anderson metal - insulator transition in the normal state  @xcite , hence the superconductor would not be a good metal any more .",
    "the analysis proceeds as follows . in the dirty limit",
    ", the superfluid velocity is related to the phase gradient by @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the diffusion constant  @xcite .",
    "the supercurrent density is still proportional to @xmath62 and is found to be independent of @xmath222  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at a given current , the gauge - invariant phase gradient @xmath223 is proportional to @xmath224 .",
    "now the angular dependence of the green s function in the dirty limit is only weakly anisotropic , with a large @xmath225-wave component that does not depend on the direction of the circulating current ( and hence does not contribute to the difference in mode occupation ) and a small @xmath226-wave component that is proportional to @xmath227  @xcite .",
    "using the above - mentioned dependence of the gauge invariant phase gradient on the diffusion coefficient , we then find that at a given current , the @xmath226-wave component of the green s function is independent of the mean free path @xmath228 .",
    "futhermore , for the situation of a homogeneous circulating current , the angular dependence of the green s function is restricted to @xmath225- and @xmath226-wave components only  @xcite .",
    "thus the components of the green s function relevant for evaluation of @xmath229 in superconducting flux loops are independent of the impurity concentration and hence our estimates of effective superposition size apply also to the dirty superconductor regime .",
    "the results in table  [ tbl : experimentsandeffectivecatsizes ] thus show that while not trivially small , the effective superposition sizes as bounded by the number of electrons that are in different modes in the two branches of the superposition are considerably smaller than previous estimates of the number of electrons carrying the supercurrent , which were based on simply counting all electrons within a london penetration depth of the surface  @xcite . in fact",
    "these estimates can now be replaced by the number of electrons in different modes within the two branches , @xmath126 , since only this number of electrons is actually moving in opposite directions in the two branches .",
    "specifically , our microscopic analysis of all electronic degrees of freedom shows that when electron indistinguishability is taken into account , the number of electrons responsible for the observed difference in supercurrent is actually far smaller than the number of electrons within the london penetration depth . furthermore , there is a marked contrast between the fact that the values of @xmath230 are mesoscopic , while the two branches nevertheless have macroscopically distinct values of the two observables , persistent current and magnetic moment .",
    "we show below that this discrepancy is due to the fermi statistics of the electrons .",
    "while the sizes obtained here are generally larger than typical estimates of size for superposition states realized in molecular and optical systems  @xcite and could reasonably be termed mesoscopic , they are still well short of anything that could be considered truly macroscopic .",
    "we therefore conclude that the superposition states in flux qubits are superpositions of relatively small numbers of particles that nevertheless result in a large difference in magnetic moment and current between the two branches because the electrons are circulating in opposite directions at high speeds ( the fermi velocity , which is of order @xmath2ms@xmath231 ) around a path enclosing a relatively large surface area .",
    "the actual number of electrons that would be found to be behaving significantly differently in the two branches if one could measure them at the microscopic level is , however , seen to be quite modest .",
    "this situation is illustrated qualitatively in fig .  1 by schematics of the shells at the fermi surface that contain the occupied one - electron levels participating in cooper pairing within each of the two branches of the superposition .",
    "the effect of realizing current flows @xmath232 in the two branches is to shift each such fermi shell by a distance @xmath233 in @xmath35-space .",
    "compared to @xmath234 , the radius of the fermi sphere , this distance is extremely small , so that the two fermi shells overlap strongly .",
    "the vast majority of modes therefore have identical occupation numbers in both branches : only modes in the non - overlapping regions in fig .",
    "1 have a change in occupation number .",
    "however , these regions are on _ opposite _ sides of the fermi sphere .",
    "furthermore , simply stating that the two branches are separated by a slight shift of the entire fermi sphere is incompatible with the fact that electrons are indistinguishable .",
    "because of the electron indistinguishability and fermi statistics , rather than shifting a large number of electrons by the small distance @xmath161 , the shift is instead properly described as a relatively small number of electrons being moved all the way from one side of the sphere to the other and thereby changing their momentum by @xmath235 .",
    "this is an extremely large velocity change because of the large diameter of the fermi sphere , even though the small value of @xmath236 means that the volume of the non - overlapping regions and therefore the number of electrons moved are both small .",
    "this discrepancy between a large difference in the value of an observable quantity ( current @xmath192 or magnetic moment @xmath237 ) and the small number of particles actively involved in the superposition by _ distinguishably _ changing modes , @xmath126 , thus derives from the fermionic character of electrons",
    ".    the corresponding gap between difference in observable quantities and number of particles involved might be smaller for large scale superposition states in a bosonic system .",
    "finding a physical system to realize this constitutes a challenge for future study , both experimental and theoretical .    .",
    "each fermi sphere is shifted by a distance @xmath238 in @xmath35-space and the shells are color coded as red and blue , with the overlapping region denoted by the color sum , purple .",
    "note that the figure is _ not _ to scale , with the shift being exaggerated relative to the diameter of the fermi spheres in order to be visible .",
    "only modes in the non - overlapping regions ( red and blue ) have different occupation numbers in the two branches . ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltank ] ) the maximum difference in occupation number for any one mode is bounded by @xmath239 .",
    "this number is always small unless current differences are close to the critical current ( more specifically , to the depairing current of the material ) , which is impossible in a system where the current passes through josephson junctions .",
    "in fact , the ratio between critical and josephson currents can be written as @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the superconducting condensate fraction ( @xmath242 at @xmath199 ) , @xmath243 the junction resistance in the normal state and @xmath244 the sharvin resistance of the superconducting material  @xcite .",
    "given that josephson junctions have high resistivity while superconducting metals have low resistivity , this ratio is usually large .",
    "one strategy to reduce it is to use large area josephson junctions to obtain small @xmath243 , connected by superconducting wires with small cross - section to maximize @xmath244 , as shown in figure [ fig : cross ] .",
    "a schematic of a large josephson junction corrected to a narrow wire , maximizing the change in kinetic energy of the loop electrons and thus the ratio of @xmath245 . ]",
    "another option is to increase the number of modes available , by scaling up the physical dimensions of the system .",
    "however , the number of modes scales only linearly with system size . to reach truly macroscopic superposition states in this way",
    "would therefore require the physical dimensions of the flux qubits to be scaled up by many orders of magnitude . while this would certainly make it extremely challenging to maintain or observe any superposition behaviour in the presence of environmental noise , recent estimates indicate that coherence may still be observable in high inductance single josephson junction loops with linear dimension of order 1 cm  @xcite .",
    "the results presented above show that the microscopic number of effective electron constituents in flux qubit superpositions with dimensions accessible to experiments today , such that these constituents behave differently in the two superposition branches , is of order @xmath246 .",
    "this addresses a long - standing question related to macroscopic quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "we note that while this value derives from an operational measure that is independent of the physical system , asking only how many @xmath8-particle measurements are required to distinguish the two superposition branches , it is nevertheless useful to ask the further question of how these @xmath8-particle measurements may be realized and whether they may be decomposed into single particle measurements ( for an example of the latter , see  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , one may ask whether it is possible to control the @xmath125 constituent degrees of freedom individually , as is assumed in most applications of a ghz state , i.e. , does the size of the superposition state reflect the number of useful dimensions ( analogous to the distinction between useful and non - useful or ",
    "fluffy bunny \" entanglement  @xcite ) ? here",
    "we note that due to the large superconducting gap , actual realization of the distinguishability measure would require an @xmath8-electron quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement that does not involve excitation across the gap .",
    "such measurements have not been devised so far and would require bridging about one order of magnitude in energy between the qubit tunnel matrix elements and the energy gap .",
    "nevertheless , the present bound on this measure does provide a microscopic analysis of the number of electronic constituents that could behave in a schrdinger cat - like fashion , i.e. , show ( macroscopically ) demonstrably different behavior in the two branches .",
    "it is then a further question as to whether and how this demonstrably different behavior of the individual constituents may be realized .",
    "we have used the functional path integral formalism to connect the microscopic and macroscopic description of flux qubits and to derive expressions for correlation functions of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this connection was then used to characterize the effective size of superposition states in these systems by evaluating the change in occupation number of electronic modes between the two branches of a flux superposition state that is characterized by macroscopic branch differences in physical observables .",
    "we showed that this quantity constitutes an upper bound on the distinguishability measure developed previously by two of us .",
    "the results obtained here for flux qubits of physical dimension accessible today show that the number of electrons , or equivalently , of cooper pairs , that participate actively in the superposition behavior is of order @xmath246 , considerably less than the total number of electrons participating in the supercurrent .",
    "this result shows that even if there is no intrinsic size or number scale limiting the existence of macroscopic quantum superpositions , the quantum statistics of the constituent particles can nevertheless be important for evaluating the effective number of particles participating in a superposition whose branches are characterized by macroscopically distinct observables . in particular , in the case of flux qubits , our analysis has revealed that it is a combination of the indistinguishability and fermionic character of electrons , together with the large numerical value of the fermi velocities , that is responsible for the large change in current and magnetic moment per particle between branches , rather than a change in state of a macroscopic number of electrons . in summary , we see that a full microscopic treatment of the electrons in flux qubits shows that the superconducting flux qubit experiments performed to date provide neither a verification nor proof for the formation of true quantum superpositions on a scale beyond a few thousand microscopic constituent particles .",
