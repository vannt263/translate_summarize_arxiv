    "radiation of photons at angles so small that they escape along the beam pipe is usually not taken into account in kinematic fits . at previous @xmath0 colliders such as lep , the losses due to photon radiation were acceptable @xcite . at future facilities such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) or the compact linear collider ( clic )",
    ", photon radiation will be much stronger due to higher center - of - mass energies and stronger focussing of the beams .",
    "this paper presents a novel method to take the energy and longitudinal momentum of photon radiation into account in kinematic fits .",
    "a priori information about the momentum spectrum of photon radiation is used to treat the photon s momentum as a measured parameter in the fit . as a test case ,",
    "the production of @xmath6/@xmath7 pairs decaying to light quark jets at the ilc is considered , with fully simulated monte carlo events as reconstructed by the international large detector ( ild ) @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the underlying concept can be found in @xcite and a more detailed description of the method and its application tests in @xcite .",
    "the simplest method to cope with highly energetic photons escaping the detector along the beam pipe in a constrained kinematic fit is therefore to drop the energy and longitudinal momentum conservation constraints , thus losing two degrees of freedom .    here",
    "the photon is treated as a particle with a measured momentum of zero and an uncertainty derived from its known momentum spectrum . for this purpose , the photon momentum @xmath8",

    "then the photon will be treated as if it had a measured value of @xmath15 . by this procedure",
    ", the a priori knowledge of the photon s energy spectrum ( in particular the fact that it is negligibly small in most cases ) is used , and all energy and momentum constraints can be applied .",
    "the method described above is applied to the process @xmath16 events .",
    "the fraction of successful fits , the width and the shift of the reconstructed @xmath17 mass peak are used to compare the performance of the various kinematic fit variants .",

    "the tracks are matched to the calorimeter clusters by the pandora particle flow algorithm @xcite and the resulting reconstructed particles are forced into four jets by the durham algorithm @xcite .    in order to investigate the influence of isr and beamstrahlung on the performance of the kinematic fit",
    ", the results of all three fits are given for the complete event sample as well as for three subsamples with different amounts of isr energy : @xmath19 ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 .      in order to investigate the performance of the proposed method ,",
    "kinematic fits are applied to the four jets in the events from the test sample , comparing the event hypotheses `` 4  jets '' ( @xmath22 ) and `` 4  jets + 1  photon '' ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "both event hypotheses are fitted with five constraints ( @xmath24-fit ) : conservation of energy , conservation of the three momentum components and equal di - jet masses . in addition , the events are fitted also using only the three constraints ( @xmath25-fit ) that are not affected by the presence of photon radiation , i.e. conservation of the transverse momentum components and the equal mass constraint .    both values @xmath3 and the missing @xmath26  from the event @xmath27 are considered as starting values for the photon momentum in the kinematic fit , and the result with the better fit performance is chosen .",
    "the fits are compared in terms of the following three quantities : the fraction of fits with a fit probability @xmath28 , the difference @xmath29 between the peak position of the reconstructed @xmath17 mass spectrum and the input mass @xmath30 , and the gaussian width of the peak .",
    "the latter two parameters have been determined from a fit to the mass spectrum which takes into account the natural width of the @xmath17 and the small fraction of @xmath31 events in the sample @xcite .",
    "[ fig : dijetmasses ] shows the the invariant di - jet masses before and after the kinematic fit for the complete sample , including isr and beamstrahlung .",

    "due to imperfections of the lineshape fit , a nonzero value of @xmath32 is to be expected , for which a correction would be applied in a real analysis .",
    "however , if this mass shift depends on the amount of energy from isr and beamstrahlung , it leads to a broadening of the signal and thus a loss of resolution ; in addition , systematic uncertainties arise from the description of the isr and in particular the beamstrahlung energy spectrum . therefore , a mass shift that is independent of the amount of energy lost to isr and beamstrahlung is desirable",

    "the rows refer to the results from averaging the measured di - jet masses without a fit for events where the 3c fit converges , the 3c fit with only transverse momentum and equal - mass constraint , the 5c fit under a four jet hypothesis with longitudinal momentum and energy constraints in addition , and the 5c fit with an additional isr photon fit object .",
    "the subsamples are distinguished by the total energy @xmath34 of isr photons , excluding beamstrahlung . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      a comparison of the fit results demonstrates the gain in resolution achieved by kinematic fitting : the gaussian @xmath35 , which corresponds to the di - jet mass resolution , is @xmath36 for the average of the two di - jet masses without a kinematic fit and improves to @xmath37 if a kinematic fit with five constraints is used .",
    "a fit with only three constraints does not improve the resolution compared to the simple averaging of the unfitted di - jet masses .",
    "the fit with five constraints and no isr photon can not be applied to the subsample with @xmath21 , because fit probabilities above the cut of @xmath38 are essentially never achieved due to the too large amounts of missing energy and momentum .",
    "therefore this subsample , which contains @xmath39 of all events , can not be used for an analysis .",
    "the @xmath24 fit with an isr photon , on the other hand , achieves almost the same performance for the two subsamples with @xmath21 and @xmath40 in terms of the fraction of good fits ( @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 ) as well as in resolution ( @xmath43 vs. @xmath44 ) with only a small additional bias in the w mass ( @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 ) .",
    "the sample with moderate isr energy @xmath47 , which comprises @xmath48 of the events , demonstrates that the @xmath24 fit without the inclusion of an isr photon tends to develop a mass bias .",
    "this is because the energy carried away by the photon is falsely attributed to the final state jets , which increases their energy and thus the invariant mass : the mass bias increases from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . at the same time , only @xmath51 of the events yield a good @xmath24 fit under the @xmath22 hypothesis .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath23 hypothesis shows the same performance in terms of fraction of good fit , mass shift and resolution as for the sample with small missing energy .",
    "the fact that for all fit hypotheses only about half of the events have reasonable fit probabilities @xmath52 can be mostly attributed to the equal - mass constraint : the resolution for the difference of the di - jet masses is approximately @xmath53 ( twice the resolution for the di - jet mass average for the unfitted jets ) , which is of similar size as the broadening of @xmath54 due to the intrinsic w width .",
    "this indicates that in a real analysis the nave equal - mass constraint has to be modified to take the natural @xmath55 width into account .",
    "other factors that reduce the fraction of successful fits are events from processes other than @xmath56 boson pair production and the fact that the jet error parametrization employed in this analysis does not include the effects of parton showering .      the right - hand side of tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] shows the results for the case where the effect of both , isr and beamstrahlung , is considered .",
    "because the three subsamples are defined on the basis of the isr energy only , the same amount of beamstrahlung is present in each of them . a comparison with the case where only the effect from isr is considered ,",
    "demonstrates that the photon momentum parametrization eq .",
    "( [ eq : parametrization ] ) derived from the isr momentum spectrum also works quite well in the presence of beamstrahlung , at least at the level of beamstrahlung that is expected for the nominal ilc parameter set .",
    "since beamstrahlung in the monte carlo simulation used for this analysis is simulated solely through a variation of the energy of the incoming leptons , no transverse momentum is carried by the beamstrahlung .",
    "therefore the results for the @xmath25 fit and the di - jet masses calculated without a kinematic fit do not change when beamstrahlung effects are considered .",
    "the performance of the @xmath24 fit under the @xmath22 hypothesis is significantly reduced when beamstrahlung effects are considered due to the larger amount of missing energy .",
    "overall , the fraction of good fits goes down from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . for the subsample with less than @xmath59 of isr energy it is reduced from @xmath60 to @xmath61 . at the same time , the @xmath17 mass shift increases by approximately @xmath62 for the whole sample . for the subsample with medium @xmath34 , however",
    ", the mass shift increases from @xmath50 to @xmath63 .",
    "on the other hand , with the @xmath23 hypothesis , the @xmath24 fit performance is much less affected by beamstrahlung effects : the fraction of good fits stays almost constant , and the @xmath35 of the gaussian width of the mass peak increases only moderately , from @xmath64 to @xmath65 for the complete sample .",
    "the mass shift increases by approximately @xmath62 for the full sample , which is similar to the @xmath22 hypothesis . however , for the subsample with @xmath47 the mass shift is significantly reduced from @xmath66 to @xmath67 by the inclusion of the photon in the fit .",
    "the increase of the mass shift with respect to the isr only case indicates that the @xmath23 hypothesis can not fully accommodate beamstrahlung effects , because typically both beam particles radiate off significant energy .",
    "this may necessitate the inclusion of a second photon in the fit .    as a final check , fig .",
    "[ fig : pzresoltion ] shows the fitted longitudinal momentum @xmath68 of the photon versus the generated @xmath69 of the most energetic isr+beamstrahlung photon pair in the event , where the momenta of the isr and beamstrahlung photons with either positive or negative @xmath70 are added .",
    "it can be seen that the fitted photon momentum @xmath68 corresponds quite well to the true momentum , without any visible bias . in particular , the fact that the photon is treated as having a measured @xmath3 does not lead to a large bias towards small values of @xmath68 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the function @xmath1 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : parametrization ] ) rises very rapidly .",
    "the right side of fig  [ fig : pzresoltion ] shows the difference @xmath71 .",
    "the mean @xmath72 is small , and negative , showing that the reconstructed @xmath73 is slightly smaller on average than the generated one , as expected , but that this bias is indeed quite small . the resolution for @xmath68",
    "is found to be @xmath74 .",
    "[ fig : m35x ]",
    "in this paper a method is proposed to take the effect of isr into account in kinematic fits by introducing a photon that is treated as if its measured momentum were zero .",
    "the longitudinal momentum @xmath68 is expressed as a function @xmath1 of the parameter @xmath2 such that the true value of @xmath2 follows a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation .",
    "the performance of this method is evaluated using a sample of @xmath18 events , which is dominated by @xmath75 pair production , at @xmath76 .",
    "the sample includes the effects from isr and beamstrahlung .",
    "it is fully simulated and reconstructed , using the simulation for the ild detector at the ilc .",
    "a @xmath24 kinematic fit with energy and momentum conservation constraints and an equal - mass constraint is applied , and the results for the fit hypothesis with four jets and a photon are compared to three alternatives : a @xmath24 fit with a conventional four jet hypothesis , a @xmath25 fit where the energy and longitudinal momentum constraints are dropped , and the results obtained without a kinematic fit .",
    "the @xmath24 fit with the new @xmath23 hypothesis performs as well as a @xmath24 fit with a @xmath22 hypothesis in terms of resolution , while a @xmath25 is significantly worse and does not yield any improvement over a mass reconstruction without any kinematic fit .    for events with significant energy from isr photons ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "the fraction of good fits with a fit probability @xmath33 drops from @xmath61 to @xmath77 for a @xmath24 fit without a photon , and goes to zero for @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , as the missing energy is distributed to the jets by such a fit , a shift of the reconstructed di - jet masses towards larger values is observed .",
    "both problems are solved by the new @xmath23 hypothesis : even for large values of @xmath21 , the fraction of good fits and the di - jet mass resolution are similar to the values obtained at @xmath40 , while the mass shift remains small .    in short , under the @xmath23 hypothesis , a @xmath24 fit achieves the same resolution as with a conventional @xmath22 fit hypothesis , but independent of the amount of isr energy , without developing a mass bias , and with a similar fraction of good fits as a @xmath25 fit .",
    "although the parametrization @xmath1 was developed using the momentum spectrum of isr photons , the method also performs well in the presence of beamstrahlung , at least at the moderate level expected for the nominal parameter set of the ilc .    in a future development",
    "the parametrization could be adapted to include beamstrahlung effects .",
    "this may be necessary in scenarios with enhanced beamstrahlung , such as the `` low power '' parameter set proposed for the ilc , or at clic .",
    "we expect that under such conditions the addition of a second photon in the fit would become necessary in order to take into account the energy loss suffered by both beam particles .",
    "we would like to thank the ild simulation production team , in particular f. gaede , s. aplin , j. engels and i. marchesini , for the production of the samples of events used in this work , and t. barklow for producing the generated input files .",
