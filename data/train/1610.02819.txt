    "nowadays , there is a great deal of interest in structure and dynamics of real - world networks , from internet and society networks  @xcite to biological networks  @xcite .",
    "the key problem is how to build a model which describes the properties of a given network .",
    "such models are used in physics , information retrieval , data mining , bioinformatics , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "real - world networks have some common properties  @xcite . for example , for the majority of studied networks ,",
    "the degree distribution was observed to follow the power law , which means that the portion of vertices with degree @xmath1 decreases as @xmath2 for some @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "another important property of complex networks is high clustering coefficient  @xcite which , roughly speaking , measures how likely two neighbors of a vertex are connected .",
    "another key metric in complex networks analysis is the assortativity coefficient which was first introduced by newman  @xcite as the pearson s correlation coefficient for the pairs @xmath4 . in assortative graphs edges tend to connect vertices of similar degrees , while in disassortative networks vertices of low degree are more likely to be connected to vertices of high degree .",
    "assortativity coefficient lies between -1 and 1 ; when this coefficient equals 1 , the network is said to have perfect assortative mixing patterns , when it equals 0 , the network is non - assortative , while at -1 the network is completely disassortative .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , despite pearson s correlation coefficient is most commonly used to measure assortativity of a network , this coefficient is size - depend when the degree distribution has infinite variance .",
    "another way to analyze assortativity is to consider the behavior of @xmath0   the average degree of a neighbor of a vertex of degree @xmath1 .",
    "a graph is called assortative if @xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath1 , whereas it is referred to as disassortative when @xmath0 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "we analyze @xmath0 instead of measuring the correlation since the obtained function of @xmath1 can give a deeper insight into the network structure .",
    "it was previously shown that in some real - world networks @xmath0 behaves as @xmath5 for some @xmath6 , which can be positive ( assortative networks ) or negative ( disassortative networks )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , as we show in this paper , in a wide class of preferential attachment models @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "assortativity has many applications , for instance , it can be used in the epidemiology . in social networks",
    "we usually observe assortative mixing , so diseases targeting high degree individuals are likely to spread to other high degree nodes . on the other hand , biological networks are usually disassortative , therefore vaccination strategies that specifically target the high degree vertices may quickly destroy the epidemic network .    in this paper , we study the behavior of @xmath0 in the t - subclass of the pa - class of models , which was first introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this class includes a lot of well - known models based on the preferential attachment principle : lcd  @xcite , buckley - osthus  @xcite , holme - kim  @xcite , ran  @xcite , etc .",
    "despite the fact that the t - subclass generalizes many different models , we are able to analyze @xmath0 in the whole class of models for @xmath9 ( the case of finite variance ) . we prove that the expectation of @xmath0 asymptotically behaves as @xmath10 ( up to a constant multiplier ) .",
    "however , this approximation works reasonably well only for very large values of @xmath1 and for @xmath11 we observe a different behavior which may look like @xmath5 for some @xmath12 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ paclass ] , we give a formal definition of the pa - class and present some known results .",
    "then , in section  [ assort ] , we state new results on the behavior of @xmath0 . in section  [ experiments ] , we make some simulations in order to illustrate our results for @xmath0 .",
    "we prove all theorems in section  [ proves ] .",
    "let us formally define the pa - class of models which was first suggested in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) be a graph with @xmath15 vertices @xmath16 and @xmath17 edges obtained as a result of the following process .",
    "we start at the time @xmath18 from an arbitrary graph @xmath19 with @xmath18 vertices and @xmath20 edges . on the @xmath21-th step ( @xmath22 )",
    ", we make the graph @xmath23 from @xmath24 by adding a new vertex @xmath25 and @xmath26 edges connecting this vertex to some @xmath26 vertices from the set @xmath27 .",
    "denote by @xmath28 the degree of a vertex @xmath29 in  @xmath30 .",
    "if for some constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 the following conditions are satisfied @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 then the random graph process @xmath30 is a model from the pa - class . here , as in  @xcite , we require @xmath37 and @xmath38 . we further omit @xmath15 in @xmath39 for simplicity of notation .",
    "as it is explained in @xcite , even fixing values of parameters @xmath31 and @xmath26 does not specify a concrete procedure for constructing a network .",
    "there are a lot of models possessing very different properties and satisfying the conditions  ( [ onestepchangeddegreedraft][loopprobability ] ) , e.g. , lcd , buckley ",
    "osthus , holme ",
    "kim , and ran models .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of vertices of degree @xmath1 in  @xmath30 .",
    "the following theorems on the expectation of @xmath40 and its concentration were proved in  @xcite .",

    "[ concentration ] for every model from the pa - class and for every @xmath45 we have @xmath46    these two theorems mean that the degree distribution follows ( asymptotically ) the power law with the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "a t - subclass of the pa - class was introduced in  @xcite . in this case , the following additional condition is required : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the number of edges between the vertices @xmath51 and @xmath52 in @xmath30 and @xmath53 is a non - negative constant .",
    "note that this property still does not define the correlation between edges completely , but it is sufficient for studying the clustering coefficients .",
    "also , this subclass still covers all well - known models mentioned above .",
    "there are two well - known definitions of the clustering coefficient of a graph @xmath54 .",
    "the _ global clustering coefficient _ @xmath55 is the ratio of three times the number of triangles to the number of pairs of adjacent edges in @xmath54 .",
    "the _ average local clustering coefficient _ is defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the local clustering coefficient for a vertex @xmath51 : @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the number of edges between the neighbors of the vertex @xmath51 and @xmath60 is the number of pairs of neighbors .",
    "the clustering coefficients for the t - subclass were analyzed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it was proven that in some cases ( @xmath61 ) the global clustering coefficient @xmath62 tends to zero as the number of vertices grows for all models from the pa - class . additionally , it was shown that the average local clustering coefficient @xmath63 does not tend to zero for the t - subclass with @xmath64 . in @xcite the local clustering coefficient averaged over the vertices of degree @xmath1 was analyzed .",
    "it was proven that this coefficient @xmath65 asymptotically decreases as @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "in this paper , we analyze the assortativity property in the t - subclass .",
    "one possible way to analyze the assortativity of an undirected graph @xmath54 is to consider the average degree of the neighbors of vertices with a given degree @xmath1 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the set of edges of the graph @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an increasing function of @xmath1 , then the network is assortative .",
    "vice - versa , in the disassortative case @xmath0 decreases .",
    "let @xmath70 be the sum of the degrees of all neighbors of all vertices of degree @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath0 can be defined as @xmath71 .",
    "hence , in order to estimate @xmath72 , we first estimate @xmath73 and then use theorems  [ expectation ] and  [ concentration ] on the behavior of @xmath40 .",
    "namely , we prove the following theorems .",

    "note that the restriction @xmath84 is essential and for @xmath85 the result is expected to be completely different . indeed , when we analyze @xmath86 we have to estimate the expected sum of the degrees of the neighbors of a new vertex @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath85 , then this sum grows faster than linearly in @xmath51 and our approximations do not hold .    according to theorem  [ pacd ] ,",
    "all networks from the t - subclass with @xmath74 are assortative .",
    "however , @xmath72 increases slowly , as @xmath10 , unlike @xmath5 in real - world networks .",
    "it is also worth noting that in theorem  [ pacd ] we analyze only the average value of @xmath0 and proving concentration is left for future research .",
    "in this section , we look at the behavior of @xmath0 in a three - parameter model from the family of polynomial graph models defined in @xcite .",
    "this model belongs to the t - subclass and by varying the parameters we can analyze the effect of @xmath31 ( or , equivalently , @xmath87 ) on @xmath0 . in all the experiments we generated polynomial graphs with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and different values of @xmath31 . in other words",
    ", we fixed the probability of a triangle formation and vary the parameter of the power - law degree distribution .",
    "detailed graph generation process is described in  @xcite .",
    "0.48     0.48     first , let us illustrate our main result for @xmath72 ( see theorem  [ pacd ] ) .",
    "we generated polynomial graphs for different @xmath31 and compared the obtained values of @xmath0 with their theoretical approximation @xmath91 .",
    "we noticed that for @xmath92 the theoretical value of @xmath72 is extremely close to the experiment .",
    "however , if @xmath93 , then @xmath0 turn out to be consistently smaller than their theoretical approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : c_d_graphs ] illustrates this observation and shows @xmath0 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "however , according to our additional experiments , the obtained for @xmath93 difference tends to zero as @xmath96 , as expected .",
    "the possible reason for such a slow convergence is the error term @xmath97 appearing in the proof in the case @xmath93 .",
    "we also compared the theoretical value of @xmath72 ( for @xmath98 ) with the asymptotic formula @xmath99 ( see figure  [ fig : clust_c_2_d ] ) .",
    "interestingly , from figure  [ fig : c_d_graphs ] it may seem that @xmath0 grows as @xmath5 for some @xmath6 ( as it was observed in real - world networks ) .",
    "however , as @xmath1 becomes large ( @xmath100 ) , one can indeed observe the logarithmic growth .",
    "now let us prove theorem [ pasexp ] . it can be shown that a.a.s .",
    "the maximum degree in @xmath30 is less than @xmath107 for any @xmath108 .",
    "also , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , one can show that @xmath110 . as a result , for @xmath111 ( for any constant @xmath112 )",
    "we have @xmath113 for any @xmath75 .",
