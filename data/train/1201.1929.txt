    "the spacetimes analyzed here , known as ori - type spacetimes , were foremost described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first paper presents a time machine model in which closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) evolve in a bounded region of space from a well - behaved spacelike initial slice .",
    "this slice @xmath0 , just as the entire spacetime , is asymptotically flat and topologically trivial .",
    "in addition , this model fulfills the weak energy condition on @xmath0 and up until and beyond the time slice , displaying the causality violation .",
    "the second paper uses particular vacuum solutions to construct time machine models where the causality violation occurs inside an empty torus , constituting the core of the time machine . in that case the matter field surrounding the ( empty ) torus satisfies the weak , dominant , and strong energy conditions .    here we will comprehensively discuss the geometric and ctc structure of the class of ricci flat chronology violating spacetimes given in @xcite . the analysis for the other class discussed in @xcite will only be given as a supplement , since  although it is the predecessor in some sense  the details are much harder to reveal because of the more complicated metric tensor , so here the research is still going on .",
    "the structure of other particular ori - type spacetimes  pseudo schwarzschild and pseudo kerr  are discussed in @xcite .    before starting with our main investigations",
    "we describe the important underlying time machine structure .",
    "particles move through spacetime along causal curves , null curves are the trajectories of massless particles whereas particles with non - vanishing mass are described by timelike curves .",
    "suppose now that we are given a spacetime @xmath1 containing ctcs .",
    "the physical interpretation would be that a particle moving once around a ctc would encounter itself in its own past .",
    "a similar argument can be adduced in the case of null curves .",
    "this is the reason why spacetimes with closed causal curves ( cccs ) have been qualified as time machine spacetimes .    while it is easy to construct spacetimes containing ctcs or cccs , it is more difficult to find examples of spacetimes that are  to some extent  physically reasonable . in @xcite , a.",
    "ori presents a list , setting constraints on what should be classified as a realistic time machine model .",
    "one essential notion in general relativity is the cauchy development or domain of dependence of a subset @xmath2 of a spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "it is connected with the problem of formulating the einstein equations as a well posed initial value problem and the concept of global hyperbolicity .    from a realistic point of view",
    "it is desirable to obtain cccs as the unevitable consequence of a cauchy development .",
    "however , the interior of the cauchy development of an achronal subset @xmath2 is globally hyperbolic and , therefore , excludes any cccs .",
    "the most one can hope for is that there are points in the boundary of the cauchy development which lie on cccs .",
    "this is the central idea of a time machine structure ( tm - structure ) for a spacetime .",
    "we will consider @xmath1 to be a four - dimensional manifold and a metric tensor @xmath3 on @xmath1 with signature @xmath4 , such that the lorentzian manifold @xmath5 together with a fixed time - orientation is a spacetime .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the set of all points @xmath7 that lie on some closed causal curve in @xmath1 .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath6 as the causality violating region or the time machine .",
    "if @xmath8 , we say that causality is violated at @xmath9 .",
    "the causality condition is said to hold on a subset @xmath10 if @xmath11 .",
    "[ def - tm - structure ] we say that @xmath5 has tm - structure if the following three properties hold for @xmath1 :    1 .",
    "there exists an open subset @xmath12 of @xmath1 on which the causality condition holds , 2 .",
    "there is a spacelike hypersurface @xmath13 contained in @xmath12 , such that 3 .   for an achronal , compact subset",
    "@xmath14 the future domain of dependence of @xmath15 contains points in its boundary at which causality is violated , i.e. , @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the causality violating region @xmath6 is said to be _",
    "compactly constructed_.    this seems to be a reasonable condition for any spacetime that may be viewed as a time machine model .",
    "although there definitely are many more additional conditions one could impose , we will focus on tm - structure here . it should be noted that models with tm - structure can satisfy the weak , strong and dominant energy condition ( see @xcite ) for the matter content of the spacetime if properly constructed .",
    "_ example : _ consider the smooth manifold @xmath17 with the global coordinate system @xmath18 on @xmath1 , @xmath19 being a circular coordinate .",
    "define the metric tensor on @xmath1 by @xmath20 then @xmath5 becomes a vacuum spacetime , the so - called ( four - dimensional ) lorentz cylinder if we require the timelike vector field @xmath21 to be future pointing .",
    "we see immediately that all @xmath19-coordinate lines are ctcs .",
    "hence , every point of @xmath1 lies on a closed timelike curve .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath22 for any globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , chapter 14 ) . on the other hand , in the case of the lorentz cylinder",
    ", we have @xmath23 . mainly because of physical reasons ( or everyday experience ) we do not want to consider the lorentz cylinder as a spacetime with tm - structure .",
    "the idea behind a tm - structure is the following : one can think of @xmath24 as the set of points @xmath7 that are predictable from @xmath15 in the sense that no inextendible causal curve through @xmath25 can avoid @xmath15 . because the set @xmath26 does not contain points at which causality is violated ( for it is a subset of @xmath24 on which the so - called strong causality condition holds )",
    ", the most one can hope for is that there are points in the boundary of @xmath24 contained in @xmath6 .",
    "as it can be seen from the definition of the tm - structure , spacelike hypersurfaces are an important entity in the context of tm - structures .",
    "therefore , we include the following criterion .",
    "let @xmath27 be a smooth function on a lorentzian manifold @xmath1 and @xmath28 be in the image of @xmath29 .",
    "then the sets @xmath30 are hypersurfaces in @xmath1 and @xmath31 is timelike , @xmath32 spacelike .",
    "the set @xmath33 is open , hence a lorentzian manifold in the usual manner . because of the defining property of @xmath34 the one form @xmath35 is nowhere vanishing .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 is a hypersurface in @xmath34 , hence in @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 since @xmath29 is constant on @xmath31 .",
    "this proves the decomposition @xmath39 and because @xmath40 is spacelike this implies that @xmath41 is of index @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath31 is timelike .",
    "if we consider @xmath32 , almost the same arguments apply , except that now @xmath40 is timelike .",
    "hence @xmath43 is a spacelike subspace of @xmath44 , i.e , @xmath32 is spacelike .    in coordinates",
    "@xmath45 the differential @xmath46 of @xmath29 is @xmath47 and @xmath48 using this formula and applying the preceding proposition to the coordinate neighborhood , one obtains :    [ prop - hypersurfaces - in - coord ] if @xmath45 are local coordinates of a lorentzian manifold @xmath1 , the coordinate slices @xmath49 for @xmath50 are    1 .",

    "timelike hypersurfaces if @xmath52    for all points @xmath9 in the coordinate neighborhood .",
    "here we investigate spacetimes described in @xcite and we start with the smooth manifold @xmath53 and introduce coordinates @xmath54 on @xmath1 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are natural coordinates on @xmath58 and @xmath19 is a circular coordinate on @xmath59 . for any smooth function @xmath60",
    "we define the metric tensor @xmath3 on @xmath1 by @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the symmetrized tensor product . emphasizing the role of @xmath29",
    ", we write @xmath63 for the semi - riemannian manifold @xmath5 .",

    "the ricci tensor of @xmath63 is given by @xmath65 so we assume that @xmath29 satisfies the relation    @xmath66    to get ricci flat spacetimes @xmath63 . as the timelike unit vector field @xmath67 shows , @xmath63 is time orientable .      before we make an explicit choice for @xmath29 and embark on a more detailed study of a special example of the described class , we shall consider the general case .",
    "of course , it is the topological factor @xmath59 in @xmath63 and the metric component @xmath68 that is responsible for the appearance of ctcs . given @xmath55 , @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 the curves @xmath69 \\to m , \\qquad s \\mapsto \\gamma_{t , x , y}(s ) { \\mathrel{\\mathop:}=}(t , x , y , s)\\ ] ] are closed and timelike provided @xmath70.\\ ] ] depending on the explicit form of @xmath29 , this is a condition on the coordinates @xmath71 determining a non - empty subset of @xmath58 that consists of points sitting on ctcs of the form . by prop .  [ prop - hypersurfaces - in - coord ] , the hypersurfaces @xmath72 defined by @xmath73 are    @xmath74    respectively .",
    "therefore , any timelike curve in @xmath72 , in particular ctcs , must be contained in that part of @xmath72 where @xmath75 .",
    "the same result may also be obtained by calculating @xmath76 directly with the condition @xmath77 .",
    "we will see later for one choice of @xmath29 how these two ingredients  the region of ctcs and the causal character of @xmath72allow for a tm - structure of @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the lie derivative , such that the killing equation for a vector field @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore we denote the algebra of killing vector fields on some open subset @xmath81 of a manifold @xmath1 by @xmath82 .",
    "we will make repeated use of the following proposition , the proof of which can be found in @xcite , p.  61 . here",

    "there is only one obvious and non - tivial killing vector field , which is actually not even globally defined .",

    "generally , for a vector field @xmath102 the killing equation @xmath80 is equivalent to the following system of pde s : @xmath103 the assumption @xmath104 and the supposition that @xmath105 depends only on @xmath19 reduces this system of pdes to the simple ordinary differential equation @xmath106 hence @xmath107 and @xmath90 is a killing vector field .",
    "it remains to show that there is a choice for @xmath29 , such that there is no other solution to the killing equation which is not a constant multiple of @xmath90 .",
