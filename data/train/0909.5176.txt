    "interpreting the data from high energy hadron colliders such as the tevatron and lhc relies on parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which describe the probability densities for quarks and gluons in the proton as a function of lightcone momentum fraction @xmath0 and qcd factorization scale @xmath1 . in current practice @xcite , the pdfs",
    "are measured by parametrizing them at a low scale @xmath2 , using functional forms in @xmath0 that contain many adjustable parameters .",
    "the pdfs at higher @xmath1 are calculated using qcd renormalization group equations , and the best - fit parameter values are found through a `` global analysis , '' in which data from a variety of experiments are simultaneously fitted by minimizing a @xmath3 measure of fit quality .    in the hessian @xcite and lagrange multiplier @xcite methods , the uncertainty range of the pdfs",
    "is estimated by accepting all fits for which @xmath3 is not more than some fixed constant @xmath4 above the best - fit value .",
    "traditionally , @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath6 @xcite have been used to estimate the 90% confidence range .",
    "when these `` large '' @xmath4 values are used , weight factors or penalties may be included in the definition of the goodness - of - fit measure , to maintain an adequate fit to every individual data set @xcite ; or the uncertainty range along each eigenvector direction in the hessian method can instead be estimated as the range where the fit to every experiment is acceptable @xcite .",
    "large @xmath4 tolerance has long been a source of controversy .",
    "some groups @xcite reject it in favor of the @xmath7 for 68% confidence ( @xmath8 for 90% confidence ) that would be expected from gaussian statistics ; however , results presented in this paper provide renewed evidence that substantially larger values of @xmath4 are necessary .",
    "a potential motivation for large @xmath4 is based on conflicts among the input data sets , which signal unknown systematic errors in the experiments , or important theoretical errors introduced , _ e.g. _ , by our reliance on leading - twist nlo perturbation theory , with a specific treatment for heavy quarks .",
    "it makes sense to scale up the experimental errors  which is equivalent to raising @xmath4to allow for such conflicts @xcite .",
    "however , the conflicts among experiments were recently shown @xcite to be fairly small : the measured discrepancies between each experiment and the collective implications from all of the others suggest a minimum @xmath9 for 90% confidence , but supply no clear incentive for @xmath10 .",
    "this is supported also by results from the nnpdf method @xcite , which finds conflicts among the data sets to be relatively small .",
    "it is also supported by the distribution of @xmath3 per data point for the individual data sets @xcite ; and by the observation that the average @xmath3 per data point in the global fit is close to 1 , which suggests that the experimental errors are not drastically understated and that the theory treatment is adequate @xcite .",
    "another source of uncertainty in pdf determination is the _ parametrization dependence _",
    "error , which comes from representing the pdfs at @xmath2 , which are unknown continuous functions , by expressions that are only adjustable through a finite number of free parameters . in traditional practice",
    ", flexibility is added to the parametrizing functions one parameter at a time , until the resulting minimum @xmath3 ceases to decrease `` significantly . ''",
    "however , at whatever point one chooses to stop adding fitting parameters , further small decreases in @xmath3 remain possible . this aspect of the pdf problem , namely that the number of fitting parameters is not uniquely defined , can spoil the normal rules , such as @xmath7 for 68% confidence , which would otherwise follow from standard gaussian statistics .",

    "the exponential form @xmath40 allows for the possibility of a large ratio between the coefficients of the power - law behaviors at @xmath36 and @xmath39 , without requiring large coefficients .",
    "it also conveniently guarantees that @xmath41 is positive definite  although that could in principle be an unnecessarily strong assumption , since the @xmath42 parton distributions are not directly observable , so it is only required that predictions for all possible _ cross sections _ be positive .",

    "( [ eq : xseries ] ) can help to express the assumed smoothness of the parton distributions ; although if @xmath43 is large , additional conditions must be imposed to prevent unacceptably rapid variations .",
    "the constraints on smoothness and limiting behavior at @xmath36 and @xmath39 are important . for without them , the momentum sum rule @xmath44 and the valence quark number sum rules @xmath45 would have no power , because mildly singular contributions near @xmath46 in ( [ eq : momsum ] ) or near @xmath47 in ( [ eq : numsum ] ) could make arbitrary contributions to those integrals , without otherwise affecting any predictions .    in past practice , only a small number of nonzero parameters @xmath48 have been retained in ( [ eq : xseries ] ) , as exemplified by the typical choice ( [ eq : pexample ] ) .",
    "the number of parameters can be increased to add flexibility , and thereby reduce the dependence on choice of parametrization . however",
    ", that quickly runs into a technical difficulty : as more fitting parameters are included , the numerical procedure to find the minimum of @xmath3 becomes unstable , with large coefficients and strong cancellations arising in @xmath33 .",
    "the resulting best fits , if they can be found at all , contain implausibly rapid variations in the pdfs as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this technical difficulty can be overcome by a method based on chebyshev polynomials .",
    "these polynomials have a long tradition in numerical analysis , although they have only recently begun to be applied to pdf studies @xcite .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials are defined  and conveniently calculated  by recursion : @xmath49 since @xmath50 is a polynomial of order @xmath51 in @xmath20 , the parametrization ( [ eq : xseries ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 conveniently maps the physical region @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath56 are formally equivalent to the parameters @xmath57 ; but they are more convenient for fitting , because the requirement for smoothness in the input pdfs forces the @xmath58 parameters to be reasonably small at large order @xmath51 . this can be seen from the following property of the chebyshev polynomials : @xmath59 with the mapping @xmath60 , @xmath50 has extreme values of @xmath61 at the endpoints and at @xmath62 points in the interior of the physical region @xmath63 .",
    "chebyshev polynomials of increasingly large @xmath51  thus model structure at an increasingly fine scale in @xmath0 .    because the chebyshev method provides so much flexibility in the parametrized input forms ,",

    "this difficulty can be overcome by defining an effective goodness - of - fit measure that is equal to the usual @xmath3 plus a penalty term that is based on a measure of the structure in the input distributions . a particular way to include this `` soft constraint ''",
    "is described in appendix 2 . ( the method is a major improvement over a method used to enforce smoothness in a preliminary version of this paper , which was based solely on the magnitudes of the coefficients @xmath58 . )    with the chebyshev method , it becomes possible to produce fits with three to four times as many free parameters than were tractable in previous pdf fitting .",

    "the shift produced by the change in parametrization is much larger than the previous uncertainty estimate .",
    "these are regions where the available data provide little constraint on the pdfs , so their estimated uncertainty in the cteq6.6-style fit was artificially small due to the lack of flexibility in that parametrization . other contemporary pdf fits use still less flexible parametrizations , which must underestimate the true uncertainty in those regions even more .",
    "the fits shown in this section were made using a relatively crude method for imposing smoothness on the chebyshev polynomial fits ( based on limiting the magnitudes of the coefficients of those polynomials ) . as a consequence ,",

    "to facilitate studying the effect of imposing constraints such as @xmath139 at @xmath36 , instead of parametrizing @xmath140 and @xmath141 separately , the sum @xmath142 was parametrized in the manner described above for the other flavors , while the ratio @xmath104 was parametrized by @xmath143 this method provides freedom for @xmath140 and @xmath141 separately that is comparable to the great freedom for other flavors , while allowing the ratio @xmath104 in the limit @xmath36 to be controlled entirely by @xmath144 .",
