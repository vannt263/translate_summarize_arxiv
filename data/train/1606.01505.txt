    "we will prove that for any pure state , its maximum basis entropy will be @xmath35 , as long as we choose right projectors to measure them .",

    "+      for most states , regardless of pure states or mixed states , their minimum basis entropy is zero , which means there exists a complete set of orthogonal projectors , under these projectors , we can get the full knowledge of this state .",
    "but there are some states , their minimum basis entropy are not zero , which means no matter what projectors we use to measure them , there is always some information we can not get .",
    "this inaccessible information , we will show next , is related to quantum discord .",
    "+ quantum discord comes from the projective measurement@xcite , just as the basis entropy . for a bell state ,",
    "its basis entropy is a constant , so it s easy for us to calculate its minimum basis entropy .",
    "so let s take a bell state as an example to explain why the quantum discord is related to minimum basis entropy . for bell state like @xmath51 , the subsystem is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the discord of this state is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the quantum mutual information between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath56 is the measurement mutual information between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from this equation",
    "we can see that the quantum discord of this state comes from @xmath57 .",
    "then let s calculate the basis entropy of the joint system @xmath58 , measure @xmath58 by projectors @xmath59 , and after this projective measurement the whole system @xmath58 will become @xmath60 and @xmath61 therefore the basis entropy of the joint system @xmath58 is equal to the quantum discord between its subsystems",
    ". +        for another example , let s consider the discord of werner state@xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "one can calculate that the quantum discord of this werner state is equal to its basis entropy .",
    "for example as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , when @xmath64 , the value of quantum discord is @xmath65 , it s basis entropy is also @xmath65 . + the quantum discord of bell states or werner state are exactly equal to their basis entropy , no matter which orthogonal projectors we used to measure them , like @xmath13 or @xmath66 .",
    "this equivalence has two reasons .",
    "first , bell states or werner state are invariant under local rotations , so their basis entropy is invariant under different orthogonal projectors ; second , for bell state or werner states , they are states with the maximally mixed marginals , thus their quantum discord is equal to their minimum basis entropy . this is also true for ordinary two - qubit system @xmath67@xcite with maximum mixed marginals , its basis entropy is not a constant .",
    "we have shown in appendix c that , its quantum discord is still equal to its minimum basis entropy . for states without maximum marginals",

    "quantum discord , the theorem still holds , see discussion in appendix c +",
    "one can see that basis entropy is also highly related to quantum coherence@xcite . except the formula we use to measure",
    "basis entropy showed up naturally .",
    "one can find that the formula use to quantify coherence is actually a special case of basis entropy , it s a basis entropy with fixed basis , which means under a specific basis , there is no difference between basis entropy and coherence .",
    "but we can easily see that if a state has no coherence , we ca nt guarantee its maximum basis entropy is zero ; if a state s maximum basis entropy is zero , then it must have no coherence .",
    "this difference between these two concepts has physical meaning .",
    "for example for state @xmath30 , it has no coherence , we ca nt decohere it , since its density matrix has no off - diagonal elements .",
    "but this state s maximum basis entropy is 1 , from this perspective , we can still further decohere it . +",
    "the decoherence about coherence is basis - dependent@xcite , which means the state can only be seen as decohered under specific basis .",
    "the decoherence about maximum basis entropy is not basis - dependent , which means if we decohere a state s maximum basis entropy , the state will be fully decohered and it ca nt be further decohered .",
    "take the following state as an example .",
    "@xmath68 we decohere this state under basis @xmath69 , it will become @xmath70 according to corollary 1 , this state has basis entropy , so it can be further decohered .",
    "the corresponding projectors are @xmath71 after this , the state becomes @xmath72 according to corollary 1 , this state has no basis entropy , so it ca nt be further decohered .",
    "+ therefore the maximum basis entropy can be used as a criterion to measure how much the environment can maximum decohere a quantum system , for pure states , they are highly isolated states and they have the maximum basis entropy , so they are easy to be decohered . and for state like @xmath50 , is actually a classical state , its maximum basis entropy is zero , so it has been fully decohered , the environment ca nt further decohere it .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , the increased entropy of a state after a projective measurement is a useful physical quantity , we named this increased entropy as basis entropy and then we showed some usefulness of this new concept .",
    "the maximum basis entropy can be used to decide whether a state is pure or not , and the minimum basis entropy can be used to detect the existence of quantum discord . at the end of this paper",

    "<S> projective measurement can increase the entropy of a state @xmath0 , the increased entropy is not only up to the basis of projective measurement , but also has something to do with the properties of the state itself . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we define this increased entropy as basis entropy . </S>",
    "<S> and then we discuss the usefulness of this new concept by showing its application in deciding whether a state is pure or not and detecting the existence of quantum discord . and </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the paper , this new concept can also be used to describe decoherence . </S>"
