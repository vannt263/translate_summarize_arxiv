    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors@xcite has attracted much attention in many aspects .",
    "not only the high @xmath3 itself , but also a number of experiments indicating non - universality of the superconducting gap function , such as sign reversing , anisotropy , or the presence of nodes , suggest an unconventional pairing mechanism .",
    "most probable candidate for such an unconventional mechanism is the pairing mediated by spin fluctuations , where the superconducting gap changes sign between the disconnected fermi surfaces , namely , the so - called @xmath4 pairing@xcite .",
    "back in 2001 , one of the present authors proposed that spin fluctuation mediated pairing in systems with nested disconnected fermi surfaces may give rise to a very high @xmath3 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "the idea is that the repulsive pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations can be fully exploited without introducing nodes of the superconducting gap on the fermi surfaces .",
    "although the fermi surface of the iron - based superconductors does resemble the proposed fermi surface configuration , there are some important differences .",
    "one is that the fermi surface in the iron - based superconductors has multiple orbital characters , and second is that there can be frustrations in the sign of the gap function , which can give rise to gap nodes on the fermi surface . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on this gap - sign frustration problem , and propose that the fermi surface configuration that gives the least frustration provides the optimal condition for high @xmath3 in the iron - based superconductors . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two of the present authors pointed out that maximizing the fermi surface multiplicity leads to the optimization for @xmath3 , but considering the frustration problem studied in the present paper , the `` sweet spot '' for high @xmath3 is further limited to a narrow window of the fermi surface configuration .",
    "let us first describe the band structure of lafeaso .",
    "lafeaso takes a layered structure , where fe atoms form a square lattice in each layer , sandwiched by as atoms with tetrahedral coordination .",
    "we use the band structure obtained from first principles@xcite to construct the maximally localized wannier functions@xcite .",
    "these wannier functions have five orbital symmetries ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 refer to those for this unit cell with two fe sites as shown in fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the two wannier orbitals in each unit cell are equivalent in that each fe atom has the same local arrangement of other atoms .",
    "we can then take a unit cell that contains only one orbital per symmetry by unfolding the brillouin zone , and an effective five - band model on a square lattice is obtained , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 axes are rotated by 45 degrees from @xmath12-@xmath13 .",
    "( fe ) , @xmath14 ( as below the fe plane ) and @xmath15 ( above fe ) .",
    "( b ) the band structure ( left ) of the five - band model for lafeaso , and the fermi surface ( right ) at @xmath16 for 10 percent electron doping .",
    "the main orbital characters of some portions of the bands and the fermi surface are indicated .",
    "the dashed horizontal line in the band structure indicates the fermi level for 10 percent electron doping .",
    "the short arrow in the band structure indicates the position of the dirac cone closest to the fermi level .",
    "the gray areas in the fermi surface around the zone corners represent the @xmath17 fermi surface , which is barely absent for 10 percent electron doping .",
    "( c ) the portion of the band that has mainly the @xmath1 orbital character .",
    "[ fig1],width=302 ]    in fig.[fig1](b ) ( right ) , the fermi surface for 10 percent electron doping is shown in the two - dimensional unfolded brillouin zone .",
    "the fermi surface consists of four pieces : two concentric hole pockets ( denoted here as @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) centered around @xmath20 , two electron pockets around @xmath21 @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xmath24 , respectively . besides these pieces of the fermi surface",
    ", there is a portion of the band near @xmath25 that touches the @xmath26 , so that the portion acts as a `` quasi fermi surface @xmath27 '' around @xmath25 . as for the orbital character , @xmath28 and portions of @xmath29 near brillouin zone edge",
    "have mainly @xmath6 and @xmath7 character , while the portions of @xmath29 away from the brillouin zone edge and @xmath17 have mainly @xmath1 orbital character ( see also fig.[fig1](c ) ) .",
    "the band structure and the fermi surfaces of the iron - based superconductors are sensitive to the lattice structure . in this section ,",
    "we consider hypothetical lattice structures of lafeaso , where we fix the bond length at its original length and vary the bond angle @xmath28(fig.[fig2](a))@xcite .",
    "we first neglect the three dimensionality ( out - of - plane hoppings ) , and consider a two dimensional model .",
    "the fermi surface is obtained for 10 percent electron doping .",
    "when the bond angle is large , two hole fermi surfaces , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are present around the wave vector ( 0,0 ) , while the @xmath17 around @xmath25 is missing . as @xmath28 decreases , the @xmath17 fermi surface appears around @xmath25 , and there are now three hole fermi surfaces .",
    "this appearance of the additional fermi surface has been noticed as an effect of increasing the pnictogen height @xcite .",
    "when @xmath28 is further reduced , the @xmath18 fermi surface disappears , and again the fermi surface multiplicity reduces to two , but in this case one around @xmath30 and another around @xmath25 .",
    "such a disappearance of the @xmath18 hole fermi surface was first noticed in the band calculation of ca@xmath31al@xmath32o@xmath33fe@xmath31as@xmath31 @xcite by miyake _",
    "_ in refs.@xcite .",
    "this material indeed has very small bond angle of about 102 degrees .     and",
    "@xmath34 orbital characters at ( 0,0 ) is indicated.,width=302 ]    fig.[fig3 ] explains schematically the band structure / fermi surface variation against the bond angle reduction@xcite . as the bond angle is reduced , the @xmath35 band below the fermi level around @xmath25 rises up , while another @xmath35 portion of the band above the fermi level around @xmath30 comes down .",
    "this band deformation can be understood from fig.[fig1](c ) , where the @xmath35 portion of the band for the original lafeaso is extracted . in the tightbinding picture ,",
    "the energy difference between the wave vectors @xmath30 and @xmath25 is roughly equal to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the nearest neighbor hopping of the @xmath35 orbital . as the bond angle is reduced , the contribution to @xmath37 from the fe@xmath38as@xmath38fe path decreases , while that from the direct fe@xmath38 fe path increases .",
    "the two contributions have opposite signs , so that the reduction of the bond angle results in a decrease of @xmath37@xcite .    when the bottom of the upper @xmath35 portion sinks below the @xmath34 bands around @xmath30 , a band structure reconstruction takes place , and now the two bands that are degenerate at @xmath30 repel with each other ( one going up , the other going down ) as the wave vector moves away from @xmath30 ( fig.[fig3](c ) ) .",
    "in this situation , the band below these two bands has @xmath35 character near @xmath30 , and changes its character to @xmath34 as the wave number increases .",
    "therefore , just before the inner hole ( @xmath18 ) fermi surface disappears , it has strong @xmath35 character .    .",
    "the black ( red ) portions indicate the bands with strong @xmath35 @xmath39 orbital character.,width=302 ]",
    "having understood the fermi surface variation against the bond angle , we now consider how this should affect the gap function of the superconductivity mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "the pairing interaction mediated by spin fluctuations is repulsive , so the superconducting gap has an tendency of changing its sign between the initial and final wave vectors of the pair scattering .",
    "another important point is that the spin fluctuations develop at wave vectors that bridge the portions of the fermi surface having the same orbital character@xcite .    in the presence of the @xmath35 originated @xmath17 and @xmath34 originated @xmath18 and @xmath19 fermi surfaces ( case ( b ) in fig.[fig3 ] ) ,",
    "it is known that the @xmath17-@xmath29 interaction among portions having @xmath35 character and the @xmath28-@xmath29 interactions among portions with @xmath34 character dominate , and the superconducting gap is fully open on all the fermi surfaces while changing its sign as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath40 along @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath17 fermi surfaces .",
    "this is the fully gapped @xmath4 gap@xcite .    on the other hand , in the absence of the @xmath17 fermi surface ( case ( a ) in fig.[fig3 ] ) , the pairing interaction between the @xmath35 portions of the @xmath29 fermi surfaces and that between the @xmath34 portions of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 fermi surfaces results in a frustration in the sign of the gap function .",
    "this situation was studied in several previous papers@xcite .",
    "this can result in either nodal @xmath4-wave or @xmath42-wave pairings , where the nodes of the gap go into the @xmath29 fermi surface in the former , and @xmath28 in the latter .",
    "a schematic figure summarizing the above is shown in fig.[fig4]@xcite . as was shown in ref.@xcite",
    ", this frustration effect degrades @xmath3 of the superconductivity , so that the lattice structure acts as a switch between high @xmath3 nodeless and low @xmath3 nodal superconductivity .",
    "wave , the nodal @xmath4 wave and @xmath42 wave gap are schematically shown .",
    "the solid red ( dashed blue ) curves represent positive ( negative ) sign of the gap .",
    "the arrows indicate the dominating nesting vectors.,width=377 ]",
    "here we discuss another situation where the frustration arises in the sign of the superconducting gap function . as mentioned in section[fsvsangle ]",
    ", the @xmath35 orbital character strongly mixes into the @xmath18 fermi surface just before the fermi surface vanishes as the bond angle is reduced .",
    "in this situation , there are now @xmath35 components on @xmath18 , @xmath29 , and @xmath17 ( if present ) fermi surfaces .",
    "since these fermi surfaces interact with repulsive pairing interactions , once again , a frustration arises in the sign of the superconducting gap ( fig.[fig5](a ) ) .",
    "in addition to this , there can also be some @xmath34 component remaining in the @xmath18 fermi surface , and this portion tends to change the sign from the @xmath29 fermi surfaces ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) so this can be another factor for the frustration .    to actually see this frustration effect ,",
    "here we consider hypothetical lattice structures of ca@xmath32al@xmath31o@xmath33fe@xmath31as@xmath31@xcite , where we vary the bond angle from 108 to 109 degrees , and contrust a two dimensional five orbital model in the unfolded brillouin zone . in this angle regime ,",
    "the @xmath18 fermi surface is barely present , and it is indeed composed of mixed @xmath35 and @xmath34 orbital components .",
    "we apply fluctuation exchange approximation to this model@xcite , and obtain the eigenfunction ( gap function ) of the linearized eliashberg equation as was done in ref.@xcite . in fig.[fig6 ] , we show the gap function for the two angles for 10 percent electron doping and temperature @xmath43ev .",
    "it can be seen that the magnitude of the gap on the @xmath18 fermi surface is very small , and its sign actually changes as the bond angle is varied , reflecting the frustration .     and ( b ) @xmath34 portions of the fermi surface in the case where the inner hole fermi surface ( @xmath18 ) is barely present . in this case",
    ", @xmath18 is a mixture of @xmath35 and @xmath34.,width=302 ]    al@xmath31o@xmath33fe@xmath31as@xmath31 .",
    "the bond angle @xmath28 is varied to 108 or 109 degrees , while the bond length is fixed to the original value.,width=453 ]",
    "when the systems exhibit some three dimensionality , the above mentioned variation of the fermi surface configuration against the bond angle depends on @xmath2 .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig.[fig7 ] . in systems with moderate three dimensionality ,",
    "the orbital character change of the @xmath18 fermi surface and its disappearance first starts at @xmath44 ( around z point ) as the bond angle is reduced , and ends at @xmath16 ( @xmath45 point ) .",
    "namely , the @xmath18 fermi surface becomes three dimensional before it disappears completely . in this case , the above mentioned frustration effect should be present around the top and the bottom portions of the three dimensional fermi surface .    in fact ,",
    "the above mentioned three dimensionality of the band structure is rather common for the iron - based superconductors .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite . in fig.[fig8 ] , we show the band structure of various iron - based superconductors for @xmath16 and @xmath44 planes ( in the original folded brillouin zone ) calculated by using the wien2k package@xcite .",
    "one can see that , except for lafeaso , the two bands degenerate at z point @xmath46 repel with each other as the wave vector moves away from z in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "this means that configurations ( c ) or ( d ) in fig.[fig3 ] are realized for a certain range of @xmath2 . on the other hand , in fese , lifeas and bafe@xmath31as@xmath31 the band structure near the @xmath16 plane takes configuration ( b ) , so that in these materials , the band structure near the fermi level is indeed three dimensional .",
    "conversely , the 1111 systems can be considered as somewhat exceptional in that , although the three dimensional @xmath35 band does exist , it does not come down too rapidly before the @xmath35 originated @xmath17 fermi surface appears .",
    "in fact , ndfeaso , one of the materials having the highest @xmath3 , seems to have the least frustration from the above mentioned viewpoint .",
    "namely , as seen in the band structure shown in fig.[fig9 ] in the unfolded brillouin zone@xcite , the @xmath17 fermi surface is present but the three dimensional @xmath35 band still lies above the @xmath34 bands for all @xmath2 . on the other hand , from the comparison to the band structure of lafeaso ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) , it can be seen that as a trade - off for the appearance of the @xmath17 fermi surface around @xmath25 , the three dimensional @xmath35 band along @xmath47-@xmath46 has certainly come down very close to the @xmath34 band , and for smaller bond angle or higher pnictogen position , the band reconstruction and thus the frustration starts to take place .",
    "therefore , from the present viewpoint , the `` sweet spot '' for high @xmath3 is restricted to a narrow window , which may explain the experimental observations@xcite .    .",
    "the `` sweet spot '' is restricted to the regime where the @xmath35 originated @xmath17 fermi surface is effective and the @xmath18 fermi surface has @xmath34 character for all @xmath2 .",
    ", width=377 ]     and @xmath44 planes are shown . the red solid circles ( or elipse )",
    "indicates the portion where the two bands degenerate at wave vector @xmath48 repel with each other as the wave number increases , while the dashed blue cirles are the portions where the two bands degenerate at ( 0,0 ) both form a hole fermi surface . for lafeaso ,",
    "a typical example for 1111 systems , the three dimensional band along @xmath45-z having @xmath35 character ( green dashed elipse ) stays above the degenerate @xmath34 bands ( red solid).,width=377 ]     fermi surface is present around the wave vector @xmath25 , and ( ii ) the three dimensional @xmath35 band from @xmath47 to @xmath46 does not intersect the @xmath34 bands for all @xmath2.,width=377 ]",
    "as described in the present paper , the multiplicity of the fermi surfaces and even their orbital characters change as the lattice structure is varied .",
    "because of the presence of multiple fermi surfaces and the repulsive pairing interaction mediated by the spin fluctuations , frustration can arise in the sign of the gap on the disconnected fermi surfaces . this can result in nodal structures in the gap function , and should generally work destructively against superconductivity .",
    "conversely , from the present viewpoint , the optimal situation for the spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity is when the @xmath35 @xmath17 fermi surface is effective and the @xmath18 fermi surface has @xmath34 orbital character for _ all _ @xmath2 . as far as the first principles band calculations are concerned , this situation is realized in limited materials like ndfeaso and smfeaso , where the highest @xmath3 among the iron based superconductors is observed experimentally . from this viewpoint",
