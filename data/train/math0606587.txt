    "i.e. , the smallest @xmath5 for which a realization of the dirac matrices @xmath17 can be found , is @xmath25 , whereas in 2d and 1d , @xmath26 . in this article , we are interested in the 2d case",
    ".    concerning the cauchy problem , global existence in 1d was established by chadam @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , but remains open in space dimension two and higher .",
    "motivated by the work of klainerman and machedon  @xcite on the maxwell - klein - gordon and yang - mills equations , we want to attack the global existence problem by improving the local well - posedness theory and then make use of conserved quantities , but the snag is that the energy density of dkg does not have a definite sign ( see  @xcite ) . however , a partial replacement may be the charge conservation : @xmath27which could prove useful for the global problem , provided one has local well - posedness with @xmath0 data for the dirac spinor .",
    "in fact , bournaveas  @xcite used the charge conservation to give a new proof of chadam s global result in 1d , by proving a low regularity local well - posedness theorem .",
    "these considerations motivate our interest in the local well - posedness of the cauchy problem for dkg with initial data @xmath28 for minimal @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the standard @xmath0-based sobolev space .",
    "the corresponding homogeneous space will be denoted @xmath31 .",
    "to get an idea of the minimal regularity required for local well - posedness , note that in the massless case @xmath32 , dkg is invariant under the rescaling @xmath33 the scale invariant data space is therefore @xmath34 and one does not expect well - posedness with any less regularity than this . since the charge corresponds to the @xmath0 norm of the spinor , we may say that dkg is charge - critical in 3d and charge - subcritical in 2d and 1d .",
    "on the other hand , dkg is a system of nonlinear wave equations with quadratic nonlinearities , and it is well - known ( see  @xcite ) that for such equations there is in general a gap between the regularity predicted by scaling and the minimal regularity at which one has local well - posedness , and this gap increases as the space dimension decreases .",
    "this is due to buildup effects in the product terms , but if the quadratic nonlinearities satisfy klainerman s null condition , the worst interactions of products of waves are cancelled , and less regularity is required for local well - posedness .",
    "this idea first appeared in  @xcite .    for dkg ,",
    "the complete null structure was established by the authors in  @xcite , building on earlier work by klainerman and machedon  @xcite and beals and bzard  @xcite .",
    "the new idea developed in  @xcite is that the quadratic form @xmath35 , which appears in the klein - gordon part of dkg , and which was already known to be a null form ( see  @xcite ) , appears also in the dirac part of dkg , not directly but via a duality argument .    in  @xcite",
    "we used the null structure , combined with bilinear space - time estimates of klainerman - machedon type , to prove local well - posedness of dkg in 3d for data with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we get arbitrarily close to the scaling regularity . for earlier work on the 3d problem , see  @xcite .    in the present work we study the 2d problem .",
    "here it is harder to get close to the scaling regularity , since the range of space - time estimates narrows as the dimension decreases . on the other hand",
    ", dkg is charge - subcritical in 2d , so we stand a better chance of exploiting the charge conservation than in the charge - critical 3d case . in  @xcite , bournaveas proved local well - posedness of dkg in 2d for data with @xmath38 and @xmath37 by using linear strichartz type estimates ( see also  @xcite ) , and also with @xmath39 and @xmath40 by using the null structure reported in  @xcite . here",
    "we prove the following :    [ thm1 ] suppose @xmath41 belongs to the convex region described by ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) @xmath42 then the dkg system in 2d is locally well - posed for data .",

    "the critical regularity for the spinor is @xmath44 , so one may ask what happens in the interval @xmath45 , which is not covered by our theorem . partial answers to this question can be obtained by studying in more detail the iterates of the problem .",
    "we have some results for the first and second nontrivial iterates , which which will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "these results suggest , in particular , that there is no well - posedness for @xmath46 .",
    "this gap phenomenon is typical of 2d ( and 1d ) problems .    in connection with the iterates ,",
    "we remark that the regularity of the first iterate for @xmath47 was studied by zheng @xcite , who proved that if @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the homogeneous part of @xmath50 , then the modified iterate , defined by @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 for @xmath53 , provided @xmath54 is @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the point being that energy and sobolev estimates are enough to show this if @xmath57 for some @xmath58 , but they fail to give the result for @xmath59 .",
    "however , our result here shows that the regularity is in fact far better than @xmath0 , namely @xmath60 for all @xmath58 , if @xmath48 ; this follows from theorem [ thm2 ] below .    throughout the rest of this article ,",
    "the space dimension is understood to be @xmath61 . as a matter of convenience",
    ", we consider only the massless case @xmath62 , but the discussion can easily be modified to include the linear mass terms , since we deal with local - in - time theory in a contraction mapping setup .    for convenience we rewrite the system in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66^t$ ] , @xmath67 for column vectors @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ notation ] we fix the notation , and define the function spaces in which we iterate .",
    "we also review the splitting of the dirac equation into positive and negative energy parts . in section [ nullbilinear ] , we reduce theorem [ thm1 ] to proving two bilinear @xmath43 estimates , we review the crucial null structure of the bilinear forms involved , and we discuss two key ingredients that will be used to prove the @xmath43 estimates : a bilinear generalization of the strichartz estimate for free waves in 2d , and a variation on the klainerman - machedon estimate in 2d . in sections",
