    "the advent of the new generation of ground - based erenkov or satellite @xmath0-ray telescopes has inaugurated a new era in @xmath0-ray astronomy . in particular , these instruments may also be used to probe fundamental physics , for example , a possible energy - dependent vacuum refractive index for photon due to quantum - gravitational effects in space - time foam  @xcite .",
    "magic  @xcite , hess  @xcite and fermi  @xcite collaborations have reported time - lags in the arrival times of high - energy photons , as compared with photons of lower energies .",
    "the most conservative interpretations of such time - lags are that they are due to emission mechanisms at the sources , which are still largely unknown at present",
    ". however , such delays might also be the hints for the energy - dependent vacuum refractive index .",
    "assuming that the refractive index @xmath1 depends linearly on the @xmath0-ray energy @xmath2 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quantum gravity scale , it was shown that the time delays observed by the magic  @xcite , hess  @xcite and fermi  @xcite collaborations are compatible with each other  @xcite for @xmath4 around @xmath5 gev .",
    "it is well known that many theories of quantum gravity predict non - trivial vacuum refractive indices , varying linearly with the energy scale of the photons and with the distance of the source .",
    "however , there are several stringent restrictions coming from other independent tests of lorentz symmetry that must be taken into account  @xcite . to survive these stringent bounds on lorentz invariance violation imposed by the plethora of the current astrophysical experiments , any model of quantum - gravity predicting non - trivial refractive indices",
    "should be characterised by the following features : * ( i ) * photons are _ stable _ ( _ i.e. _ do _ not _ decay )  @xcite but should exhibit a modified _ subluminal _ dispersion relation with lorentz - violating corrections that should grow _ linearly _ with @xmath6 where @xmath4 is close to the planck scale ; * ( ii ) * the medium should not refract electrons , so as to avoid the synchrotron - radiation constraints  @xcite ; * ( iii ) * the coupling of the photons to the medium must be independent of photon polarization , so as to avoid birefringence , thus avoiding the stringent pertinent constraints  @xcite ; * ( iv ) * the formalism of a local effective field theory lagrangian in an effectively flat space - time , including higher - derivative local interaction terms to produce a refractive index  @xcite , breaks down .",

    "the space - time foam is modelled as a gas of point - like d - brane defects ( d - particles ) in the bulk space - time of a higher - dimensional cosmology where the observable universe is a d3-brane ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : recoil ] ) . within this class of d - foam models ,",
    "a refractive index for photon propagation in vacuo was re - derived by using a detailed modelling of the interaction of an open string , representing a photon , with a d - particle  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in such a model , photons are represented as electrically neutral open string states , which are captured by d - particles during topologically non - trivial scattering processes , in which an incident open string , with momentum @xmath8 splits into constituent intermediate string states , stretched between the d - particle and the d3 brane worlds .",
    "the life time of such intermediate states can be calculated , as in @xcite , by means of computing the ( causal ) time delays required for the first of a series of re - emitted outgoing waves , with attenuating amplitudes . it is found proportional to the incident energy of the photon , @xmath10 equivalently ,",
    "this time delay is the time taken for an intermediate string state , stretched between the d - particle and the d3 brane to grow from zero size to a maximum one and back to zero , with the end of the string attached to the d3 brane moving with the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "this is a purely stringy effect , not existing in any local quantum field theory limit , and is compatible with the string space - time uncertainty relations  @xcite for this case .",
    "the result ( [ timedelay ] ) admits an interpretation  @xcite in terms of a non - trivial _ subluminal _ refractive index of the d - particle foam , which scales linearly with the photon energy .",
    "interestingly , the d - particle foam looks transparent to charged particles such as electrons due to charge conservation , and then avoids the stringent constraints coming from synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this leading refractive index effect , obtained form the causal outgoing waves during the scattering of strings with d - particles , there are corrections induced by the recoil of the d - particle itself , which contribute to space - time distortions that we now proceed to discuss . to this end",
    "we note that , from a world - sheet view point , the presence of @xmath11-particle recoil may be represented by adding to a fixed - point ( conformal ) @xmath12-model action , the following deformation  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 in the sum denotes the appropriate number of spatial target - space dimensions . for a recoiling d - particle confined on a d3 brane , @xmath15 .",
    "on writing the boundary recoil / capture operator ( [ fullrec ] ) as a total derivative over the bulk of the world - sheet , by means of the two - dimensional version of stokes theorem we have ( omitting from now on the explicit summation over repeated @xmath16-index , which is understood to be over the spatial indices of the d3-brane world ) : @xmath17   \\theta\\left (   x^{0}\\right )   \\partial^{\\alpha}x^{i}\\right ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\alpha ' } \\int_{d}d^{2}z\\ , ( 2u_{i})\\,\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta } ( \\partial^{\\beta}x^{0})\\bigg [ \\theta_\\varepsilon \\left(x^{0}\\right ) + x^0 \\delta_\\varepsilon \\left (   x^{0}\\right ) \\bigg ] \\partial ^{\\alpha}x^{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is an @xmath19-regularised @xmath20-function .",
    "this is equivalent to a deformation describing an open string propagating in an antisymmetric @xmath21-background corresponding to an external constant in target - space `` electric '' field , @xmath22 where the @xmath23 terms in the argument of the electric field yield vanishing contributions in the large time limit @xmath24 , and hence are ignored from now on .    to discuss the space time effects of a recoiling d - particle on an open string state propagating on a d3 brane world , which is of interest to us here",
    ", we should consider a @xmath12-model , in the presence of the b - field , which leads to mixed - type boundary conditions for open strings on the boundary @xmath25 of world - sheet surfaces with the topology of a disc : @xmath26 with @xmath27 given by ( [ constelectric ] ) .",
    "absence of a recoil - velocity @xmath28-field leads to the usual neumann boundary conditions , while the limit where @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , leads to dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "considering commutation relations among the coordinates of the first quantised @xmath12-model in the above background , one also obtains a non - commutative space - time relation  @xcite  , @xmath31 ) , the non commutativity is only between spatial target - space coordinates ] .",
    "the pertinent non commutativity refers to spatial coordinates along the direction of the electric field , and is expressed in the form @xmath32 = i \\theta^{10 } ~ , \\qquad \\theta^{01 } (= - \\theta^{10 } ) \\equiv \\theta =   \\frac{1}{u_{\\rm c}}\\frac{\\tilde u}{1 - \\tilde{u}^2 } \\label{stnc}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the target time , and we assume for simplicity and concreteness recoil along the spatial @xmath34 direction .",
    "thus , the induced non commutativity is consistent with the breaking of the lorentz symmetry of the ground state by the d - particle recoil .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the born - infeld _ critical _ field .",
    "notice that the presence of the critical `` electric '' field is associated with a singularity of both the effective metric and the non commutativity parameter , while , as we shall discuss below ( [ effstringcoupl ] ) there is also an effective string coupling , which vanishes in that limit .",
    "this reflects the _ destabilization of the vacuum _ when the `` electric '' field intensity approaches the _ critical value _ , which was noted in @xcite .",
    "since in our d - particle foam case , the rle of the ` electric ' field is played by the recoil velocity of the d - particle defect , the critical field corresponds to the relativistic speed of light , in accordance with special relativistic kinematics , which is respected in string theory , by construction .",
    "the space - time uncertainty relations ( [ stnc ] ) are consistent with the corresponding space - time string uncertainty principle  @xcite @xmath37 of crucial interest in our case is the form of the induced open - string _ effective target - space - time metric_. as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , to find it , one should consider the world - sheet propagator on the disc @xmath38 , with the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) . upon using a conformal mapping of the disc onto the upper half plane with the real axis ( parametrised by @xmath39 ) as its boundary  @xcite ,",
    "one then obtains : @xmath40 with the non - commutative parameters @xmath41 given by by ( [ stnc ] ) , and the effective open - string metric , due to the presence of the recoil - velocity field @xmath42 , whose direction breaks target - space lorentz invariance , by : @xmath43 where , for concreteness and simplicity , we consider a frame of reference where the matter particle has momentum only across the spatial direction @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath44",
    ". moreover , there is a modified effective string coupling  @xcite : @xmath45 the fact that the metric in our recoil case depends on momentum transfer variables , implies that d - particle recoil induces finsler - type metrics  @xcite , _",
    "i.e_. metric functions that depend on phase - space coordinates , that is space - time and momentum coordinates .",
    "the induced metric ( [ opsmetric ] ) , will affect the dispersion relations of the photon state , by means of @xmath46 .",
    "however , because the corrections on the recoil velocity @xmath28 are quadratic , such modifications will be suppressed by the square of the d - particle mass scale .",
    "the presence of the d - particle recoil velocity will affect the induced time delays ( [ timedelay ] ) by higher - order corrections of the form , as follows by direct analogy of our case with that of open strings in a constant electric field  @xcite : @xmath47 as we mentioned previously , one observes that the d - particle recoil effects are quadratically suppressed by the d - particle mass scales , since @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the relevant string - state momentum transfer .",
    "some important remark is in order here , to avoid some confusion regarding testing the predictions of our model with experiment . as we hope",
    "becomes clear from @xcite and our discussion above , the primary time delay ( [ timedelay ] ) , is derived in the limit of infinite d - particle mass .",
    "the presence of d - particles , of course , breaks the poincare invariance of the bulk vacuum , and their recoil the associated lorentz invariance of the d3-brane world . in this sense",
    ", it is to be expected that non - trivial refractive indices characterise our d - particle foam background , even in the limit of infinite d - particle mass , where recoil motion of the d - particles is ignored .",
    "having said that , it is also clear from the above analysis , and that of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the calculation of time delays ( [ timedelay ] ) is based on computing the formation of an intermediate string and _ not _ point - like state , of a _ finite _ extent . in this sense ,",
    "such effects _ can not _",
    "be simply _ represented _ in terms of an effective _ local _ low - energy _",
    "formalism , in which one adds higher - derivative , higher - dimension non - renormalizable operators in a flat space - time lagrangian . on the other hand , the effects of the induced finsler metric , due to d - particle recoil , as well as their non - commutative contributions ( [ stnc ] )  ) the non - commutativity relation ( [ stnc ] ) over populations of ( quantum fluctuating ) d - particles in the foam , and assuming an approximately constant @xmath50 , eq .",
    "[ stnc ] becomes of the form @xmath51 = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , with @xmath52  const .",
    "the latter relation may be interpreted  @xcite as implying a lorentz violating situation , leading , in the continuum low - energy field theory limit , to higher - order derivative terms in a local effective lagrangian , which , for the case of photons we are interested in , would include terms of the form : @xmath53 the crucial qualitative difference in our case is the finsler type of the non - commutative space - time parameter , @xmath54 which in general depends on momenta .",
    "nevertheless , such links of our model with effective field theories of non - commutative space times imply that the d - particle recoil parameters can be constrained also by means of the same experiments that are used to constrain such non commutative field theories  @xcite . however , in our cases of d - particle foam , the most physically interesting case are that of isotropic , lorentz - invariant on average , gaussian stochastically fluctuating foam , for which the average recoil velocity of d - particles vanishes , @xmath55 , and only their fluctuations are non trivial , @xmath56 , _",
    "etc_. in such a case , non commutativity is much harder to detect via the methods discussed in @xcite , although the independent phenomenon of time delays ( [ timedelay ] ) , ( [ timerecoil ] ) , which is not linked to effective field theories , is much easier to falsify in high - energy gamma ray astrophysics observations , like those of @xcite .",
    "] , may admit such an effective field theory interpretation .",
    "hence , the best experiments to test our model are the ones in which simply one computes time delays in the arrival times of photons ( or electrically neutral particles ) and checks their dependence on their energies .",
    "this has been done in @xcite . in this respect",
    ", we should stress that the analysis in @xcite , where a reproduction of the peak has been used at an individual photon level , assuming linearly modified dispersion relations for photons , does not capture correctly the spirit of the present model , in view of these comments , in the sense that the latter analysis presupposes the existence of an underlying local effective lagrangian .",
    "it is for the same reason , namely the de - association of the effect ( [ timerecoil ] ) from the effective field theory formalism , that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays constraints analyses  @xcite also do not apply to our stringy d - foam framework .    in the model of @xcite",
    "the d - particles are point - like d0-branes , which are admitted in type iia string theories . in this letter",
    "we consider an extension of these ideas in the phenomenologically relevant type iib string theory with in which the rle of d - particles is played by d3-branes appropriately wrapped around three cycles , while the d3 brane worlds are provided by d7-branes , appropriately compactified to three large spatial dimensions .",
    "we derive the vacuum refractive index for the photon , and find that it depends linearly on the photon energy .",
    "in addition , in this model , in contrast to that of @xcite , there can be a time - delay for electron , which however , as we shall show , can be small enough to satisfy the stringent constraints coming from synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "we shall derive the time delays in the spirit of @xcite , by considering scattering amplitude first in the limit where the recoil of the d - particle is ignored . as we shall see",
    ", a formula analogous to ( [ timedelay ] ) will be derived .",
    "the inclusion of wrapped - up - d3-brane / d - particle recoil corrections parallels that of d0-brane above , and will not be repeated .",
    "the result is similar to ( [ timerecoil ] ) , with the d3-brane recoil to amount to quadratic and higher - order suppression by the effective `` d - particle '' mass .",
    "let us consider the type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes where the d3-branes are inside the d7-branes .",
    "the d3-branes wrap a three - cycle , and the d7-branes wrap a four - cycle .",
    "thus , the d3-branes can be considered as point particles in the universe , _ i.e. _ , the d - particles , while the standard model ( sm ) particles are on the world - volume of the d7-branes .    for simplicity , we assume that the three internal space dimensions , which the d3-brane wraps around , are cycles @xmath57 , and we denote the radius of the @xmath58th cycle @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "the mass of the d3-brane is  @xcite @xmath61 whereby @xmath62 is the string coupling , and @xmath63 is the string length , _",
    "i.e. _ , the square root of the regge slope @xmath64 . if @xmath65 , we can perform a t - duality transformation along the @xmath58th @xmath59 as follows @xmath66 and then we obtain @xmath67 . in string theories with compact internal space dimension(s ) , there are kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes and string winding modes . under t - duality",
    ", the kk modes and winding modes are interchanged . in particular , these two theories are physically identical  @xcite .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath67 .",
    "choosing @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 , and then the mass of the d3-brane can be much larger than the string scale . therefore ,",
    "anticipating the result ( [ timerecoil ] ) , we shall ignore to a first approximation the recoil of the d - particles .",
    "their inclusion ( as small , perturbative corrections ) is straightforward , according to the discussion in the previous section , and we shall come back briefly to this issue at the end of the article . in this setting , for the particles ( called nd particles ) arising from the open strings between the d7-branes and d3-branes which satisfy the neumann ( n ) and dirichlet ( d ) boundary conditions respectively on the d7-branes and d3-branes , their gauge couplings with the gauge fields on the d7-branes are @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the gauge couplings on the d7-branes , and @xmath73 denotes the volume of the extra four spatial dimensions of the d7 branes transverse to the d3-branes  @xcite . because the minkowski space dimensions are non - compact , @xmath73 is infinity and then @xmath74 is zero .",
    "thus , the sm particles have no interactions with the nd particles on the d3-brane or d - particle .",
    "to have non - trivial interactions between the particles on d7-branes and the nd particles , we consider a d3-brane _ foam _ , _ i.e. _ , the d3-branes are distributed _ uniformly _ in the universe .",
    "we assume that @xmath75 is the average three - dimensional volume that has a d3-brane in the minkowski space dimensions , and @xmath76 is the radius for the fourth space dimension transverse to the d3-branes .",
    "in addition , in the conformal field theory description , a d - brane is an object with a well defined position . while in the string field theory ,",
    "a d - brane is a fat object with thickness of the order of the string scale . in particular , the widths of the d - brane along the transverse dimensions are about @xmath77 , as follows from an analysis of the tachyonic lump solution in the string field theory which may be considered as a d - brane  @xcite . thus , our ansatz for the gauge couplings between the gauge fields on the d7-branes and the nd particles is @xmath78        we denote a generic sm particle as an open string @xmath79 with both ends on the d7-branes . for @xmath80",

    "i.e. _ , when the recoil velocity is of order of the speed of light , the corresponding string scattering amplitudes , from which the delays are evaluated , will be suppressed .",
    "thus , although there would be infinitely long delays practically for such relativistic particles ( c.f .",
    "( [ timerecoil ] ) ) , nevertheless the pertinent amplitudes would vanish , as in such a case they are given by expressions of the form ( [ 4ampl ] ) but with the factors @xmath62 being replaced by the effective string coupling @xmath143 . hence , there would be no observable effects , since the corresponding cross section would be vanishing   amplitude have been calculated in @xcite and found suppressed by a factor @xmath144 , compared to the genus g=0 tree level amplitudes , considered in @xcite and here . ] .    this observation may have important consequences when one considers models of string d - foam with low string scales @xmath145 , say of a few tev . indeed , in our type iib foam , where each d - particle is viewed as a compactified d3-brane , wrapped around three - cycles with very small radii , so that one has an effectively point - like behaviour at low energies , the corresponding mass scales can be of order of the string scale @xmath145 , provided the compactification radii are of order of the string length , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "thus , incident particles with energies higher than the order - tev string scale @xmath145 on such d - branes can easily induce recoil velocities close to the speed of light , and , as a consequence of the above discussion , for such energetic particles the foam would look transparent  . ] . on the other hand , for large compactification radii compared to the string length @xmath148 , the resulting d - particle masses can be very large ( c.f .",
    "( [ d3-mass ] ) ) , thereby alleviating the transparency of the d - foam to highly energetic particles in such models .",
    "what this means is that , in the context of the above model , for low - string scales , say @xmath149(tev ) , time delays should be expected for photons with energies much lower than tev scales , whilst photons with energies above tev will essentially remain undisturbed by the presence of d - particles , thereby not exhibiting any appreciable foam - induced time delays .",
    "therefore , astrophysical observations using cosmic photons , such as those by magic . , h.e.s.s . and",
    "fermi telescopes , can be used to discriminate low- from high - string scale models , provided of course that the respective source mechanisms for the production of the cosmic photons are understood .",
    "these remarks are useful to bear in mind when considering phenomenological constraints on d - foam models imposed by observations of very high energetic cosmic particles ( with energies of order ( or higher than ) @xmath150 ev )  @xcite .",
    "in this work we considered type iib string theory with d3-branes and d7-branes . by wrapping up the d3 branes around three cycles , and the d7 branes around four cycles , appropriately",
    ", we have focused on a representation of a space - time foam situation in this type of string theory , which extends non - trivially the type - ia ( and iia ) string theory foam model of @xcite to the phenomenologically richer type iib string theory .",
    "we derived the vacuum refractive index for photon , and found that it depends linearly on the photon energy , as in the case of @xcite .",
    "however , in the current model of foam , there are also non - trivial refractive indices for charged probes , such as electrons .",
    "this was consistent with electric charge conservation , as a result of our compactification procedures , regarding the representation of d - particles as wrapped up d3-branes , as well as our specific `` foam '' aspects of the model , namely the presence of a uniform population of such d - particles ( leading to non trivial couplings ( [ coupl - n ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , as a result of appropriate compactification , the time - delay for electron can be small enough to satisfy the stringent constraints coming from synchrotron radiation of the crab nebula .",
    "a final remark we would like to make concerns the cosmology of the model , which would epitomize the phenomenology of such space - time foam models .",
    "the constraint on the density of the d3(compactified)-brane defects at the current epoch of the d7(compactified)-brane universe , representing our world , in order to fit the photon time - delay data available to date  @xcite needs to be taken into account in conjunction with the other cosmological parameters .",
    "this would affect the energy budget of the universe , and through this , the relevant astro - particle phenomenology , in similar spirit to the type - iia ( and type ia ) d - particle foam model  @xcite",
    ". however , the calculation of the various cosmological parameters and in general the evolution of such a universe depends highly on the model , for instance on details of the target - space supersymmetry breaking after compactification , the bulk physics , etc .",
    "the study of such issues is left for the future .",
