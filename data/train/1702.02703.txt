    "the auditory system exhibits remarkable sensitivity , for it is capable of detecting sounds that elicit motions in the @xmath0 regime , below the stochastic noise levels in the inner ear @xcite .",
    "fundamental processes that enable this sensitivity have still not been fully explained , and physics of hearing remains an active area of research @xcite .",
    "mechanical detection is performed by hair cells , which are specialized sensory cells essential for the hearing process .",
    "they are named after the organelle that protrudes from their apical surface , and which consists of rod - like stereovilli that are organized in interconnected rows . incoming sound waves pivot these sterovilli , modulating the open probability of mechanically sensitive ion channels , and thus transforming motion into ionic currents into the cell @xcite .",
    "in addition , hair cells of several species exhibit oscillations of the hair bundle , in the absence of a stimulus @xcite . these oscillations were shown to violate the fluctuation dissipation theorem and are therefore indicative of an underlying active mechanism @xcite .",
    "the innate motility has been proposed to play a role in amplifying incoming signals , thus aiding in the sensitivity of detection .",
    "while their role _ in vivo _ has not been fully established , spontaneous oscillations constitute an important signature of the active processes operant in a hair cell , and provide an experimental probe for studying the underlying biophysical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of an active bundle have been described using the normal form equation for the hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "several studies have furthermore proposed that a feedback process acts on an internal control parameter of the cell , tuning it toward or away from criticality @xcite . with the inclusion of dynamic feedback",
    ", the theoretical models required three state variables , a dimension that is sufficient to support a chaotic regime , according to the poincar - bendixson theorem @xcite . numerical simulations indeed predicted a small positive lyapunov exponent , indicative of weak chaos in the innate bundle motion @xcite .",
    "the presence of chaos may help to explain the extreme sensitivity of hearing , as it has been shown in nonlinear dynamics theory that chaotic systems can be highly sensitive to weak perturbations @xcite . in the present manuscript , we explore experimentally whether innate bundle motility exhibits signatures of chaos @xcite , and apply a dimensionality test to estimate the number of state variables required to describe the dynamics of an auditory hair cell . establishing the dimensionality of the system is crucial for accurate modeling of this remarkable mechanical detector .",
    "further , we examine the effect of an applied signal on the chaoticity of bundle motion . for this purpose ,",
    "we construct poincar maps of the oscillator , subject to varying amplitudes of external forcing .",
    "we quantify the degree of chaos by computing the kolmogorov entropy associated with the spontaneous and driven oscillation of a hair bundle . finally , as a measure of the sensitivity to external perturbation , we compute the mutual information extracted from the applied signal by the oscillatory bundle .",
    "experiments were performed _ in vitro _ on hair cells of the amphibian sacculus , an organ specializing in low - frequency air- and ground - borne vibrations .",
    "sacculi were excised from the inner ears of north american bullfrogs ( _ rana catesbeiana _ ) , and mounted in a two - compartment chamber @xcite . spontaneously oscillating hair bundles were accessed after digestion and removal of the overlying otolithic membrane @xcite .",
    "all protocols for animal care and euthanasia were approved by the ucla chancellor s animal research committee in accordance with federal and state regulations . to deliver a stimulus to the hair bundles , we used glass capillaries that had been pulled with a micropipette puller .",
    "these elastic probes were treated with a charged polymer that improves adhesion to the hair bundle .",
    "innate oscillations persisted after the attachment of probes with stiffness coefficients of @xmath1 100 @xmath2n / m .",
    "the piezoelectric actuator was controlled with labview to apply sinusoidal stimulation of varying amplitudes for selected constant frequencies .",
    "hair bundle motion was recorded with a high - speed camera at frame rates of 500 hz or 1 khz .",
    "the records were analyzed in matlab , using a center - of - pixel - intensity technique to determine the mean bundle position in each frame .",
    "typical noise floors of this technique , combined with stochastic fluctuations of bundle position in the fluid , were 3  5 nm .",
    "fig [ fig : hair_bundle ] shows representative traces of active bundle motion , subject to mechanical forcing .",
    "a useful technique for estimating the dynamical dimension , @xmath3 , of a time series relies on the reconstruction of the phase space using delayed coordinates .",
    "it has been shown that this delayed - coordinate map from the original @xmath3-dimensional smooth compact manifold m to @xmath4 is diffeomorphic , provided that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the box - counting dimension of the original attractor , and @xmath7 is the embedding dimension @xcite . frequently , a lower embedding dimension , @xmath3 , is sufficient to fully unfold the attractor , but it is necessary that @xmath8 @xcite . in finding the optimal embedding dimension , we set an upper bound on the dimension of the original dynamics . from the original time",

    "for each point in the reconstructed phase space , we compute the unit vector ,    @xmath12     average angle between neighboring flow vectors as the embedding dimension is varied .",
    "the angles are calculated for a 1 minute recording of a spontaneously oscillating hair bundle , obtained at 1 khz sample rate .",
    "data was filtered with a low - pass filter to remove high - frequency stochastic processes .",
    "the cutoff frequency was set to 100 hz , sufficiently above the dominate frequency of the hair bundle ( @xmath120 hz).,width=321 ]    where @xmath13 is the time of the @xmath14 observation .",
    "these unit vectors point in the direction of local flow on the attractor . for deterministic systems ,",
    "neighboring unit vectors are nearly parallel if the attractor is densely sampled , and if the time series is not contaminated by stochastic processes .",
    "the flow therefore becomes smooth when the embedding dimension is high enough to fully unfold the attractor .",
    "the smoothness of this reconstructed phase space can be quantified by finding the average angle that each unit vector makes with its nearest neighbor @xcite . starting with one embedding dimension ,",
    "we calculate the average angle among all unit vectors , then increase the embedding dimension , and repeat the calculation .",
    "the average angle is minimized when using the optimal embedding dimension .    for a spontaneously oscillating hair bundle",
    ", the phase space fully unfolds between three and six dimensions ( fig [ fig : vector_angle ] ) . to verify these results , we perform the same analysis on a surrogate data set , generated from the original data .",
    "we multiply each fourier components by a random phase , creating a stochastic signal with the power spectrum and the autocorrelation function identical to those of the original data set . the surrogate data set does not yield a minimum similar to the original data , and the flow along phase space trajectories is much less smooth .",
    "these results indicate that , although stochastic processes are present in our system , there is an underlying low - dimensional attractor .",
    "further , up to six differential equations should be sufficient to describe the dynamic behavior of an active hair cell bundle .",
    "the poincar map provides a powerful tool for observing the dynamics of a nonlinear system in a lower dimensional space . for a perfectly periodic signal",
    ", the map takes the form of a single point , while for a quasiperiodic signal the map comprises a ring - like structure @xcite .",
    "stochastic and high - dimensional processes yield a cloud - like poincar map that has no internal structure .",
    "poincar maps constructed for the motion of a hair bundle subject to sinusoidal stimuli at varying amplitudes of forcing are shown in fig [ fig : poincare ] . to construct these poincar maps from our recordings ,",
    "we determine the discrete time series @xmath15 , where subsequent elements are the time intervals between the steepest rising flanks of consecutive bundle oscillations .",
    "we then plotted the @xmath14 versus the @xmath16 point of the series to yield the poincar map .",
    "as the series constitutes an observable in phase space , embedding theory can be applied .    at low stimulus amplitudes ,",
    "the poincar maps form a cloud - like structure . at higher stimulus amplitudes ,",
    "a ring structure emerges from the cloud .",
    "consecutive points within the sequence migrate around the edge of the ring , rather than crossing over the center , indicative of a quasiperiodic behavior .",
    "when the stimulus amplitude is increased above approximately 15pn , the hair bundle follows the stimulus , causing the ring structure to collapse onto a point .",
    "this quasiperiodic transition was observed only when the stimulus frequency was below the resonance frequency of the hair bundle .    as an additional test for the presence of low - dimensional chaos",
    ", a line is drawn from the center of the ring to each point in the sequence , and the angle formed by these lines and the abscissa is computed .",
    "this series of angles yields a new map , @xmath17 . when chaos arises via a quasiperiodic transition ,",
    "points fall off the surface of a 2-torus , since chaotic dynamic can be described by no fewer than three state variables . as a result of the torus breakdown ,",
    "the map @xmath18 becomes noninvertible and ceases to be a function @xcite .",
    "as seen in fig [ fig : poincare ] , the map is non - invertible for a weak stimulus .",
    "it approaches an invertible map when a stronger stimulus is applied to the bundle , indicating the disappearance of low - dimensional chaos . for stimulus frequencies near the hair bundle s natural frequency , the poincar maps transition directly from a cloud to a point , bypassing quasiperiodic dynamics . for stimulus frequencies above the hair bundle s resonance frequency ,",

    "kolmogorov entropy quantifies the level of chaos in the trajectory of a dynamical system @xcite .",
    "given knowledge of the state of a system at a particular time , obtained with some uncertainty , kolmogorov entropy ( k - entropy ) measures how well one can predict its state at a later time .",
    "k - entropy therefore provides a measure of how rapidly neighboring trajectories diverge , and reflects the rate at which the system is producing information .",
    "limit cycles produce no information : for a given observation of the state of the system , all future states can be predicted with the same uncertainty as the original measurement . in contrast , systems exhibiting either low- or high - dimensional chaos constantly produce information . hence , k - entropy is zero for limit cycles , positive for systems with low - dimensional chaos or noise , and infinite for purely stochastic processes .    to calculate the k - entropy , we divide the reconstructed phase space into hypercubes , and select a starting hypercube to be one that contains many points of the trajectory .",
    "we track the trajectories emerging from these points to calculate a time - dependent probability distribution over the hypercubes .",
    "the resulting distribution yields the shannon entropy as a function of time ; its time - averaged derivative is defined to be the k - entropy @xcite .",
    "an embedding dimension of five was chosen for this analysis ; nearly identical results were obtained with four or six embedding dimensions .",
    "the choice of the number of bins per dimension did not affect the results of this analysis .",
    "we used two bins per dimension , a natural choice due to the bimodal distribution in position of the spontaneously oscillating hair bundle .",

    "vertical dashed lines delineate approximate regions that correspond to poincar maps displaying cloud , ring , and point structures , as illustrated by the schematic diagrams above the graph .",
    "noise floors are indicated by horizontal dashed lines .",
    "the noise floor on the k - entropy is estimated by tracking the motion of a passive hair bundle driven by a 10  25 pn sinusoidal stimulus .",
    "the noise floor on the mutual information is estimated based on bundle oscillations in the absence of a stimulus .",
    "uncertainties in k - entropy are estimated by taking the standard deviation of the residuals from the linear fit of shannon entropy with time .",
    "uncertainties in mutual information are estimated from a bootstrapping technique that incorporates the uncertainties in position measurements , width=321 ]    we observe that the kolmogorov entropy associated with active bundle motility is reduced by the application of a sinusoidal drive ( fig [ fig : kolmogorov ] ) .",
    "the majority of the reduction in k - entropy occurs during the quasiperiodic transition from chaos to order , the regime in which the poincar maps produce a ring structure .",
    "k - entropy plateaus near zero , for forcing amplitudes above @xmath115 pn .",
    "we note that a noiseless system would plateau exactly at zero ; the finite value of the plateau is due to noise inherent in the experimental recording .",
    "detection by an individual hair cell is quantified by calculating the mutual information between the stimulus signal and the receiver response .",
    "mutual information between two processes x and y is defined as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the probability of simultaneously finding values x and y from probability distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . to calculate the @xmath22",
    ", we construct histograms of the stimulus and bundle positions using 50 bins ; qualitatively similar results are obtained using 5 , 10 , 20 and 100 bins . the mutual information between the applied stimulus and the hair bundle oscillation rises above zero , for signals of @xmath15 pn .",
    "the observed detection threshold is even lower when a stimulus is applied at the resonance frequency of the cell ( see supplemental material ) .",
    "the mutual information exhibits the steepest increase with amplitude of the applied force in the quasiperiodic regime .",
    "the auditory system has provided an experimental testing ground for theoretical work on nonlinear dynamics @xcite , nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , and condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "the fundamental questions on hearing pertain to its sensitivity , frequency selectivity , rapidity of detection , and the role of an active mechanism in shaping the response . models based on dynamic systems theory have successfully described a number of empirical phenomena .",
    "however , the theoretical models have mostly focused on stable dynamics , exploring either the limit cycle regime , or the quiescent regime in the vicinity of a bifurcation .",
    "one numerical study that explored a higher - dimensional model of hair cell dynamics showed that sensitivity of detection to low - frequency stimuli is optimized in a chaotic regime , close to the boundary with stable dynamics @xcite .",
    "our results provide an experimental demonstration that a low - dimensional chaotic attractor arises in the dynamics of active hair bundle motility .",
    "we estimate that three to six independent variables are needed to correctly characterize the dynamics of the system .",
    "further , we find that chaos is removed by the application of a signal , with different transitions from chaos to order observed when oscillations are entrained by stimuli below , near , or above the characteristic frequency of the cell .",
    "we conclude that a correct description of the auditory system will therefore need to address how hair cells circumvent or harness the presence of chaos to achieve high sensitivity .",
    "hair bundles have thus far been viewed as nonlinear mechanical detectors , and the linear response used to characterize their sensitivity .",
    "we propose that information theory provides a useful and complementary tool for analyzing the response of a hair cell , which can be viewed as a computational device that serves to extract information about the external acoustic environment .",
    "we hence apply an information theoretic approach to quantify the detection of a signal by an individual hair cell .",
    "the steepest dependence of information gain with stimulus amplitude is observed in the dynamic regime that corresponds to a transition from chaos to order .",
    "hair bundles poised in the chaotic regime exhibit measurable increases in mutual information even at pn levels of stimulus , indicating that chaotic dynamics of innate motility are consistent with high sensitivity of detection .",
