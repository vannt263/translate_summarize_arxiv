    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) predicts the possibility of electron - positron pair production in a vacuum by strong electric field @xcite .",
    "this nonlinear effect has attracted great attention due to the fact that it lays outside the scope of perturbation theory and sheds a light on the nonlinear quantum electrodynamics properties of the vacuum @xcite . as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite a planar electromagnetic wave of arbitrary intensity and spectral composition does not produce the electron - positron pairs in a vacuum because it has both the electromagnetic field invariants @xmath0 and @xmath1 equal to zero @xcite . due to this reason the pair creation was first considered for a static electric field , which evidently has non - vanishing invariant @xmath2 ,",
    "then its theoretical description was extended on the time - varying electric - type electromagnetic field @xcite . in this case",
    "the electromagnetic field invariants @xmath2 and @xmath3 obey conditions @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the totally antisymmetric tensor . in particular ,",
    "the pair creation in a vacuum in a spatially homogeneous electric field @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a unit vector in the z - direction , was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the process ( called the schwinger pair production mechanism ) is of fundamental importance in qed and in quantum field theory in general .",
    "however , previous estimates @xcite showed , that it hardly could be observed in the experiments using by that time available optical lasers whose power was far from the limit able to provide an intensity of the order of @xmath11w/@xmath12 , which corresponds to the schwinger critical electric field @xmath13  v / cm .",
    "as closer the electric field approaches the schwinger limit as the sub - barrier tunneling results in more efficient electron - positron pair production .",
    "therefore , the results of studies presented in refs .",
    "@xcite for a long time were generally believed to be of purely theoretical interest in qed .",
    "recently , fortunately , the situation has drastically changed , because the power of optical and infrared lasers rose by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this opened several ways to approach critical qed intensity .",
    "one way was demonstrated in the slac experiments @xcite , where 46.6 gev electron beam interacted with counterpropagating laser pulse , which intensity was 0.5@xmath14w/@xmath12 .",
    "the incident radiation in its turn interacted with the similar laser pulse and several electron - positron pairs were detected .",
    "then , the projects to build free - electron lasers at tesla electron - positron collider in desy and the corresponding facilities at slac , in which coherent laser beams with the photon energies of the order of several kev are supposed to be produced , are being designed @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . recently , an approach to the light intensification towards the schwinger limit by using nonlinear interaction between the electromagnetic and the langmuir wave in plasmas has been formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scheme",
    "the qed critical field can be achieved with present day laser systems .",
    "hence the theory of the schwinger effect must be considered in more detail in view of the new experimental possibilities .",
    "however , here arises a question , whether the model of pair creation by the time - varying electrical field ( [ et ] ) in a vacuum resembles well enough the experimental situation . such a field can be generated in the antinodes of the standing light wave , which is realized in a superposition of two counter - propagating laser beams . in this case",
    ", the region where electric field is much larger than the magnetic field , is relatively small and the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite describe just a small portion of the pairs that could be created by the electromagnetic wave . in the rest part",
    ", the pair creation will be affected by the presence of the time - varying magnetic field .",
    "this in its turn should lead to very complicated formulas for pair production probability .    to elucidate the role of the magnetic field component on the electron positron creation we consider below the planar circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating in the underdense collisionless plasma . even in a very low density plasma the first electromagnetic invariant @xmath2 calculated for planar electromagnetic wave",
    "is not equal to zero .",
    "that is why in a plasma the electron - positron pairs can be created by the planar wave . in this case",
    "the usage of the lorentz transformation into the reference frame moving with the wave group velocity leads to the electromagnetic wave field transformation to the purely electric field , that rotates with constant frequency , and with no magnetic field .",
    "although this anzatz reduces the problem under consideration to the situation when the pairs are created by the time varying electric field , actually , the wave magnetic field effects are incorporated rigorously into our model .",
    "we notice that similar approach has been earlier used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the method of `` imaginary time '' , simple and powerful mathematical technique for analytical continuation of the classical equations of motion postulated to apply inside the barrier , through the barrier where classical motion is not allowed to join up with the equations of motion for particles that have escaped through the barrier to the outside where classical motion is again allowed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . with the help of  the imaginary time technique",
    " we shall study in details the dependence of the pair creation probability on the frequency and the amplitude of the wave .",
    "in addition to the pairs created by the electromagnetic wave via the schwinger mechanism there is electron - positron pair creation due to the trident process @xcite and bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "we shall show that the electron - positron pair produced via the schwinger mechanism can be distinguished from the one appeared due to other mechanisms by the momentum filter , i. e. the momentum of the `` schwinger '' pair in the laboratory frame is larger .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the properties of the relativistically strong electromagnetic wave in plasma .",
    "the probability of pair creation by such a wave is calculated in section 3 . in section 4",
    "the discussions of main results and conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section we recover well known properties of a relativistically strong electromagnetic wave in an underdense collisionless plasma needed for further formulation of the time varying electric field configuration .",
    "a discussion of the wave behavior is based on the results obtained by akhiezer and polovin in ref .",

    "it also vanishes when the charges of plasma species go to zero , because @xmath41 , which in its turn @xmath42 .    the nonlinear electromagnetic wave in plasmas is also characterized by the dependence of its phase and group velocity on the plasma parameters and on the wave amplitude . from equation ( [ de ] )",
    "we find that the phase velocity @xmath43 and the group velocity @xmath44 , are related to each other via expression @xmath45 .",
