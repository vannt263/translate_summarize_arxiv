    "semiconductor based concepts for quantum information processing promise a high degree of scalability .",
    "however , the implementation of even a single qubit proves to be more difficult in semiconductors than in alternative approaches .",
    "@xcite the reasons lie in the short decoherence times and strong interactions between elementary excitations in solids .",
    "@xcite while a 7-qubit nmr quantum computer was realized already in 2001 ,  @xcite the first two - qubit quantum operation in semiconductors has been demonstrated with spin qubits only recently .",
    "@xcite    at liquid helium temperatures and below , electrons in a gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) show mean free paths as well as phase - relaxation lengths of the order of @xmath0 which are remarkably long distances .",
    "@xcite indeed , bertoni _ _ et al.__@xcite and ionicioiu _ _ et al.__@xcite have proposed a scheme for quantum computation in semiconductors that exploits these long coherence lengths for electrons propagating through quantum wires ( qwrs ) . in this scheme ,",
    "a single electron propagates through two parallel qwrs , that represent the qubit states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . a single - qubit rotation gate can be realized by an electronic directional coupler@xcite that may consist of a small window in the barrier between the two qwrs and is able to transfer the wave packet from one channel to the other .",
    "single - qubit structures have been studied theoretically by several authors@xcite who showed how the dimensions of the coupling window can be utilized to tailor the transfer process .",
    "this approach allows one , at least in principle , to apply multiple quantum gate operations to a qubit without exceeding the relevant coherence lengths .",
    "universal quantum computation requires not only one - qubit but also two - qubit gates  @xcite that are responsible for the creation of entanglement between the qubits . to this end ,",
    "two pairs of qwrs may be brought close to one another so that the electrons in the qwrs can interact with one another in a controlled way via their coulomb repulsion .",
    "this concept has been analyzed both for wave packets@xcite as well as for stationary states@xcite .",
    "the latter investigations used simple models that provide important proofs - of - principle , but do not provide quantitative predictions of realizable device structures that exhibit quantum gate operations .",
    "while two - qubit devices have only been addressed theoretically in the literature , one - qubit systems have also stimulated a number of experiments in both lateral@xcite as well as vertical@xcite nanostructures .",
    "however , quantum entanglement can clearly not be exposed in single - qubit systems as entanglement expresses the non - separability of a multi - qubit state .",
    "therefore , the following step towards the realization of a prototype quantum gate based on coupled qwrs consists of a two - qubit device .",
    "also , we should keep in mind that conceivable two - qubit experiments need realistic estimations of an entanglement witness that is experimentally accessible and a clear signature of the correct coherent functioning of the directional coupler .",
    "the aim of the present work is to theoretically study realistic single- and two - qubit quantum gates , by proposing conceptually simple and experimentally realizable novel semiconductor devices for quantum information processing .",
    "the system proposed is based on ballistic gaas / algaas qwrs and allows for the controlled generation and detection of entanglement between an all - electric mach - zehnder interferometer and an electrostatically defined single - electron double quantum dot .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometer is realized by two electrostatically defined qwrs that are connected by two coupling windows .",
    "we model the electrons that are propagating through the interferometer by stationary scattering states , and our qubit state will be defined accordingly .",
    "in fact , the original proposal of bertoni _ et al .",
    "_ involves the injection of electron wave packets into the pair of qwrs .",
    "however , we chose here a time - independent approach since , ( i ) it is equivalent to the time - dependent one when the spatial dimension of the wave packet tends to be larger than the device ( indeed , this is the case in our devices due to the small source / drain biases leading to a well defined kinetic energy of the electron ) , ( ii ) the structures that implement the quantum gates operate in the same way , ( iii ) it allows us to compute realistic estimations of the charge - self - consistent ballistic @xmath3-@xmath4 characteristics of the device .    in our calculations ,",
    "we include the detailed charge - self consistent three - dimensional device geometry , material composition , doping profile and bias voltage .",
    "importantly , we demonstrate that the all - electric mach - zehnder interferometer can function as a fully controllable single - qubit gate for experimentally attainable parameters . in addition",
    ", we have developed a green s function method for the quantitative analysis of the entangled mach - zehnder and double quantum dot system that includes the coulomb interaction between the two qubits non - perturbatively . in order to gain better qualitative insight into the numerical results , we interpret them in terms of an analytical model that reproduces the computational results qualitatively .",
    "taking both results together , we are able to show that the degree of entanglement can be related to the dc @xmath3-@xmath4 characteristics of the interferometer and that the mach - zehnder double quantum dot device can be employed as an externally controllable two - qubit gate .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we present a novel method for the calculation of the stationary ballistic current of two interacting particles in realistic three - dimensional nanostructures .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where only one of the two particles ( say , particle 1 ) contributes to the current while the second particle ( particle 2 ) is assumed to be bound .",
    "importantly , this method accounts for many - particle effects non - perturbatively which is an important prerequisite of studying entanglement and , consequently , predicting solid - state based quantum information processing .",
    "the presently developed scheme generalizes the contact block reduction ( cbr ) method for single - particle ballistic currents that we have developed previously .",
    "@xcite in analogy to the cbr method , we proceed in two steps that we will describe in this section .",
    "first , we determine the equilibrium electronic structure of a closed two - particle system , obtained by substituting the leads of our device with closed boundary conditions .",
    "then , in the second step , we calculate the current carrying states of the open two - particle system . in fact , the closed calculation only provides a convenient basis for the computation of the scattering states . for the sake of efficiency and without loss of generality , we perform the former calculation in the hartree approximation , by solving two coupled schrdinger and poisson equations .",
    "then , we use single - particle product states as the basis for the scattering states of the fully interacting two - particle device .      we consider a single - particle , single - band , effective mass schrdinger equation for this electron , and include the electrostatic hartree potential in the absence of the second particle . the closed system is represented by a hermitian hamiltonian with von neumann boundary conditions for the wave functions at the contacts ( vanishing normal derivative ) .",
    "@xcite the electronic structure of the closed device is calculated self - consistently . to this end , we iteratively solve the schrdinger equation @xmath5 \\langle\\mathbf{x}|\\alpha_{i}\\rangle \\notag \\\\   & = e_{i}^{0}\\langle\\mathbf{x}|\\alpha_{i}\\rangle\\ , , \\label{schroedingerequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the non - linear poisson equation @xmath6\\ , , \\label{nonlinearpoissonequation}\\ ] ] until the electrostatic potential @xmath7 and the total charge density @xmath8 have reached convergence .",

    "the two lowest lying quantum states can be described by an effective hamiltonian , that takes into account the energy splitting @xmath24 between the ground states of the isolated quantum dots and the tunneling coupling @xmath25 between the two quantum dots .",
    "this two - by - two hamiltonian is given by latexmath:[\\[h_{2}|y\\rangle= \\begin{pmatrix } -\\frac{\\delta}{2 } & -\\frac{t}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{t}{2 } & \\frac{\\delta}{2 } \\end{pmatrix }    values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for lateral semiconductor quantum dots are of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite we use this model hamiltonian for the subsystem of the second particle and represent the charge distribution of the electron in the ground state of each ( isolated ) quantum dot by a point charge centered at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the use of a model hamiltonian rather than a realistic three - dimensional device hamiltonian is not a principle limitation of the present method but is adequate for the concrete device geometry that we will study in detail in this paper .",

    "we develop a green s function method by extending the cbr method@xcite to the case of an open device that describes a system of two interacting particles .",
    "we stress that we will consider the two particles as distinguishable .",
    "this is not an approximation for the proposed two - qubit devices but comes directly from the system geometry . indeed",
    ", we choose the qwrs and the double dot to be well separated from each other so that no significant tunneling between the two structures can occur .",
    "in other words , the two wave functions  namely the bound state in the double dot and the scattering state in the qwrs  never overlap .",
    "this leads to the distinguishability of the two particles based on their spatial localization .",

    "( [ dysonequation ] ) requires the inversion of a huge matrix that is proportional to the number of grid points @xmath65 of the device .",
    "by contrast , the cbr method allows one to drastically reduce this effort by utilizing the following exact properties of @xmath59 that remain valid in the present many - particle case .",

    "the key point is that this is a linear matrix equation of the order of @xmath68 , since @xmath74 is nonzero only in the contact region . as a consequence ,",

    "the ballistic current can then be calculated from the transmission functions according to the landauer - bttiker formalism .",

    "the reduced density matrix of each of the qubits , obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the other qubit , represents a mixed state if and only if the two qubits are entangled .",

    "we stress that our approach does not include other sources of decoherence as , for example , electron - phonon interaction or charge fluctuations in the metallic split gates that define the structure .",
    "therefore , our reduction of the visibility is obviously ascribed to the quantum entanglement of the two qubits . on the other hand , in real experiments",
    "the visibility will be reduced by the coupling of the interferometer with any external degree of freedom and not only with the other qubit .",
