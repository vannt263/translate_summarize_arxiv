    "single - molecule fluorescence techniques measure real - time kinetics of chemical reactions , such as rna folding  @xcite , enzymatic reactions  @xcite , protein - protein , protein - oligonucleotides and protein - dna bindings  @xcite .",
    "an important application of single - molecule fluorescence techniques is to probe the binding kinetics between interaction partners and to infer binding rate constants from the fluorescence time series .",
    "in contrast to conventional ensemble - averaged measurements , single - molecule fluorescence techniques directly observes the binding stochasticity at the molecular level , allowing investigations of conformation fluctuations of individual molecules under various conditions .",
    "single - molecule fluorescence time series often exhibit transitions alternating between two observable states : fluorescent ( on ) and non - fluorescent ( off ) states .",
    "one can summarize information in such  binary \" time series using one - dimensional waiting time distributions and kinetic rate constants for association ( @xmath0 ) and dissociation ( @xmath1 ) can therefore be derived from the mean waiting times .",
    "common experimental procedures usually involve measuring single - molecule binding fluorescence time series under varied ligand concentrations .",
    "these waiting time distributions for protein binding in many cases are fit by sums of multiple exponentials or empirically by stretched exponentials  @xcite , suggesting that conformation of the single molecule fluctuates during the course of interaction .",
    "therefore , transitions between the two macroscopic states (  on \" and  off \" ) proceed through diverse conformation channels connecting microscopic states which can not be directly distinguished by fluorescence time series . such temporal variants in protein conformation are referred to as _ dynamic disorder _ if conformations fluctuate on a time scale comparable to that of protein binding  @xcite .    to analyze a binary fluorescence time series , the kinetics of binding between a single molecule and its ligand is usually described by the simple phenomenological two - state model : @xmath2}{\\rightleftharpoons } } { \\rm on } \\ , \\ ] ] where state  off \" indicates that the molecule is free and state  on \" indicates that the molecule is bound to a ligand , and the transition rate from  off \" to  on \" is proportional to the ligand concentration @xmath3 $ ] due to the law of mass action .",

    "in this two - state model , when forward and backward transitions are markovian , in other words , if the two - state model is biochemically elementary , the rate constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent of @xmath3 $ ] . however , measured single - molecule kinetics may potentially be affected by various mechanistic and technical factors including protein concentrations , protein conformations and cellular environments , etc",
    ". these factors may cause significant ligand concentration dependence of kinetic rate constants inferred by the mean waiting times as calculated by eq.[[eq : rates ] ] .",
    "in particular , transitions between observed  on \" and  off \" states can be complex due to conformation fluctuations , such that the two - state minimalistic model of eq.[[eq:2s ] ] is non - markovian and thus is not adequate to describe the true transition mechanism .",

    "in addition , we show that non - equilibrium models that violate the detailed balance constraint can also generate strong ligand concentration dependence of rate constants .",
    "we further examine the ligand dependence caused by two technical sources that are not directly related to the binding mechanism : ( 1 ) missed events , and ( 2 ) background buffer .",
    "the former is concerned with transient events that are not captured by observations , which causes overestimation and distortion of ligand dependence in waiting times .",
    "we show that missed events have an effect on waiting times similar to that by models of single protein binding site with non - fluorescent binding .",
    "the latter mechanism is concerned with ligand interactions with ambient buffer molecules , which causes a substantial reduction in the effective concentration of ligands that bind to the single molecules .",

    "the experiment showed that waiting time distributions had multiple exponential decay , suggesting that egfr molecule may have conformational changes on time scales comparable to grb2 binding .",

    "another source that likely causes ligand dependence is the violation of detailed balance in model parameters , which can be studied using non - equilibrium models .",
    "this mechanism is ignored in most studies .",
    "the typical assumption of a single - molecule analysis is that the system relaxed to its thermodynamic equilibrium at the steady state .",
    "the equilibrium assumption is rather strong and requires the system to meet stringent conditions ( the thermodynamics requires the system being isolated without energy and material exchange with its external environment ) , and it may not be always justified in particular for _ in vivo _",
    "systems that entail many energy - driven reactions  @xcite or for _ in vitro _",
    "systems that are sustained by energy sources .",
    "detailed balance violation can be tested by analyzing time series data .",
    "for example , two - dimensional joint waiting time distributions that account for two consecutive events , waiting time for binding event followed by that of a dissociation event , can be used to test whether detailed balance holds by checking the time reversibility ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite for other methods ) . as a consequence of adopting non - equilibrium model ,",
    "model parameters might not be constrained by detailed balance .",
    "a non - equilibrium model achieves a steady state with net fluxes around reaction loops , which gives rise to ligand dependence of rate constants as rational functions of ligand concentration .",
    "we note that our analysis of the effect of detailed balance is closely related to recent works that study the substrate - dependence of enzymatic turnover rate @xmath112 in fluctuating enzymes with multiple conformation channels  @xcite . under the detailed balance condition ,",
    "the dependence of production formation velocity on substrate concentration @xmath113 $ ] maintains the classic michaelis - menten form , @xmath114/(\\widetilde{k}_m+[s])$ ] , where effective catalytic rate constant @xmath115 and apparent michaelis - menten constant @xmath116 can be derived from kinetic parameters of the model for the enzyme system .",
    "when the condition of detailed balance does not hold , @xmath112 becomes in general a rational function of @xmath113 $ ] . to demonstrate that the results from our work can also be applied to analyze the turnover rate of multi - conformational enzymes , consider a general scheme of enzymatic network , where an enzyme fluctuates among several ( @xmath117 ) conformations , forming parallel and interconnected catalytic channels . through each channel",
    ", the enzyme engages the substrate and then undergos multiple ( @xmath118 ) reversible intermediate steps before finally converting the substrate into a product .",
    "the turnover rate can be expressed as the summation of turnover rates in all individual channels : @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the steady - state residence probability at the last ( @xmath118th ) substrate - bound step of the @xmath10th channel and @xmath40 is the catalytic rate constant of that channel .",
    "we can write @xmath121 , where the unnormalized residence probability @xmath122 and the partition function @xmath123 . as shown in section  [ sec : db ] , under the detailed balance @xmath122 is proportional to the substrate concentration @xmath113 $ ] and @xmath124 is a linear function of @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "thus , the conventional michaelis - menten form is preserved in @xmath112 . without detailed balance",
    ", the turnover rate @xmath112 assumes a rational functional form of @xmath113 $ ] , which can be obtained systematically using the graphic method as shown in the appendix c.    finally we studied the effect by an external buffer group that sequesters ligands , which if unaccounted could cause strong ligand dependence in rate constants .",
    "the extent of the buffering effect depends on biochemical nature of ligand - buffer interaction and the relative availability of the buffer group .",
    "it is natural to consider buffering in cellular environment of living cells where molecules are subject to ubiquitous binding reactions in a crowded molecular surrounding by specific and/or non - specific interactions .",
    "we applied our results to analyze the experiment data of labeled grb2 binding to egfr molecules by morimatsu et al .",
    "we examined the possibility that missed events due to transient binding ( and showed that this is equivalent to template ii ) were the source of the ligand dependence of the apparent association rate constant and found that the best fit could not accurately reproduce the data . the mathematically simplest and best fit resulted from assuming there were background grb2 buffers characterized by two parameters accounting for cooperativity and affinity .",
