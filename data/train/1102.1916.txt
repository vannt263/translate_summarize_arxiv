    "cluster states are highly entangled states that serve as a resource for measurement - based universal quantum computation @xcite .",

    "a number of additional methods for constructing clusters have been suggested @xcite and small photonic cluster states have been experimentally implemented @xcite .",
    "given that cluster states can , in principle , be built using probabilistic gates , an active area of research has been determining the optimal strategy for utilizing cluster resources to build the largest possible cluster state @xcite .",
    "these studies assume the existence of a collection of primitive cluster state resources which are fused together to build larger cluster states . a number of strategies were suggested and optimal strategies were identified depending on the success probability of the fusion gates .",
    "all of these studies explicitly or implicitly assume a ` pool ' or storage unit in which the primitive clusters are stored until needed for fusion .",
    "this storage unit is assumed to be noiseless : it causes no losses or decoherence to any of the stored clusters .    in this work",
    "i relax the assumption that the storage unit is noiseless .",
    "instead , i posit that the storage unit causes dephasing ( possibly due to birefringence ) to the stored clusters . as a first step ,",
    "i assume all two qubit clusters undergo dephasing and then calculate the fidelity of cluster chains of arbitrary length built from these basic decohered primitives when fusion gates are always successful .",
    "the main part of the paper will detail the construction of a five qubit cluster assuming that the cluster primitives are stored in the noisy storage units until needed for a fusion operation and including the possibility of fusion failure . whether the fusion succeeds or fails the resulting cluster(s )",
    "are sent back into the storage unit until such time as they are again needed for fusion .",
    "the result of this study is to demonstrate that recycling cluster primitives when a fusion operation fails leads to cluster states with significantly lower fidelity than cluster states constructed from only fresh clusters .",
    "this is due to the increased number of times such primitives must be stored in the noisy storage unit .",
    "taking this into account may require revisiting what are optimal cluster construction strategies .",
    "i choose to explore the construction of a five qubit cluster as it allows us to compare two simple construction methods , always fusing two - qubit clusters onto the longest chain and fusing the two longest clusters .",
    "this is a first step into accounting for the decoherence inherent in the storage unit in the cluster construction strategy .",
    "the work reported here also complements previous work in which it was shown how to utilize the freedom in performing one qubit rotations , a relatively easy task in photonic quantum computation , to arrange that the cluster state be stored in a way most robust against decoherence @xcite .    to construct clusters",
    "i utilize the type i fusion operations of browne and rudolph @xcite which is successful 50% of the time .",
    "while initially thought to be applicable only when building cluster chains , it has been subsequently shown that type i fusion alone allows for the construction of two - dimensional clusters as well @xcite .",
    "when the fusion operation is applied successfully on the edge qubits of cluster chains of length @xmath0 and @xmath1 the output will be a chain of length @xmath2 .",
    "unsuccessful application of the fusion operation will result in the length of each chain being reduced by 1 .",

    "the clusters are placed in the noisy storage unit causing them to decohere into the state , @xmath16 , where , in general the dephasing strength @xmath4 will be dependent on the amount of time the cluster remains in storage .",

    "the purity of @xmath18 reduced to @xmath19 and the entanglement of the state as quantified by the negativity @xmath20 , defined as the most negative eigenvalue of the parital transpose of the density matrix @xcite , behaves as @xmath21 .",
    "two two - qubit clusters , both dephased by an amount @xmath4 , are now fused via a type i fusion operation , assumed to be implemented without error . if successful this will result in a three qubit cluster .",
    "however , the dephasing of the resources two qubit clusters causes the fidelity of this resulting three - qubit cluster state , @xmath22 , to be suboptimal , given by : @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the entanglement @xmath20 , of @xmath22 is not maximal and , in fact , may disappear altogether if the storage time is sufficiently long ( though finite ) if the negativity is determined with the partial transpose taken with respect to qubits 1 or 3 @xmath20 is given by @xmath24 , which goes to zero at @xmath25 . when the partial transpose is taken with respect to the second qubit @xmath20",

    "additional fusion failures can continue to provide recyclable cluster material but the cluster states constructed from these recyclables will produce clusters of even lower fidelity .    when deciding which of the above construction methods to use one must take into account the possibility of fusion failure .",
    "as above , if there are no fusion failures the choice of construction method does not seem to matter . assuming some failure , the effect of storing a three - qubit cluster to wait for another three - qubit cluster is least damaging to the fidelity of the desired five - qubit cluster . however , a failure in the fusion of two three - qubit clusters in the first construction method is significantly more harmful than a failure in the fusion the two- and three - qubit clusters or the two- and four - qubit clusters of the second construction method .",
    "all of the above has assumed that the fusion operations , when successful , work perfectly .",
    "in fact , mode mismatch will likely cause errors in the output of even successful fusion operations .",
    "this additional source of error will further penalize construction methods requiring many fusion operations and make it less worthwhile to recycle cluster state material as this also requires the same states to undergo more fusion operations . because mode mismatch can modeled by correlated pauli errors @xcite , its effect is similar to , and can be determined in a straightforward manner from the work reported here .",
    "the above analysis allows us to address the following question : when is it worth recycling cluster state material and when is it better to discard everything and start over ?",
    "the answer to this question will depend on the amount of decoherence that the clusters experience at every interval and the tolerable fidelity of the desired cluster states .",
    "what i have shown is simply that using fresh clusters may result in significantly more accurate final cluster states than using recycled ones .",
    "an additional important error mechanism when constructing photonic cluster states is the loss of photons .",
    "while a complete discussion of photon loss is not within the purview of this work a short discussion is included here for the purposes of completeness .",
    "a photon can be lost at any step of the cluster state construction process : at the source , while the cluster is stored , or during the implementation of a fusion operation ( for exmaple , due to reflection off the surface of a beam - splitter or due to imperfect photon detectors ) .",
    "photon loss can only be detected upon an attempted fusion operation , as this is the only step in the construction process that requires measurement .",
    "thus , a loss occuring while the cluster state is in the storage unit or at the source to a photon that will never take part in a fusion operation will not be detected until the cluster state is used for a computation . if , however , a photon that is to be used in a fusion operation is lost , the effects of that loss will depend on the outcome of the attempted fusion operation .    upon",
    "attempted fusion between an actual photon at the edge of a cluster chain and a photon tought to be at the edge of a separate cluster chain but is actually lost ( whether lost at the source , in the storage unit , or at the beam - splitter utilized in the fusion operation ) , at least 50% of the time ( depending on the efficiency of the detector ) no photon will be detected and the fusion will be presumed to have failed . in this case",
    "no permanent damage will occur to final cluster state as the lost photon will indeed be assumed lost due to fusion failure . if , however , the ` non - lost ' photon is detected , the fusion operation will be deemed successful when in fact there is no photon connecting what were ( and actually still are ) two separate cluster states . if no further fusion operation is attempted this loss will not be detected until the cluster state is used for a computation .",
    "a similar outcome would occur if two photons taking part in a fusion operation enter the detector but only one is detected .",
    "it will be assumed that the fusion operation succeeded when , in fact , it failed .",
    "the other possible detector loss scenario is when two actual photons enter the fusion operator and one of them enters the detector but is not detected . in this case",
    ", it will be assumed that the fusion operator failed when , in fact , it was successful .",
    "what is thought to be two separate clusters of length @xmath48 and @xmath49 is really one cluster of length @xmath50 .",
    "presumably , the fusion operation would be tried again using the photons thought to be at the end of each chain : the photons at the @xmath48st and @xmath51st places in the actual chain . if this second attempt fails those two photons will be lost along with the extra ( @xmath0th ) photon that was thought to have been lost in the first fusion attempt .",
    "if the second fusion attempt is now successful there will be a chain of length @xmath52 .",
    "however , the @xmath48st place on the chain will be comprised of two photons each attached to the photons in places @xmath53 and @xmath0 and attached to each other .",
    "how this may affect computational implementations using this cluster will be the subject of future work .    in the above few paragraphs",
    "i have described the details of how photon loss at the different stages of photonic cluster state construction may affect the construction of photonic cluster states .",
    "protecting against photon loss is of primary importance to studies of fault tolerance using photonic cluster states @xcite . here",
    "i have outlined how such loss affects the cluster construction on its most basic level , the simplest cluster states .",
    "further investigation is necessary to fully develop optimal photonic cluster state construction schemes in the presence of dephasing , loss , and other error mechanisms .",
