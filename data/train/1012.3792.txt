    "recently , the scaling properties in mobility patterns of animals have attracted increasing attention @xcite .",
    "the traditional scenario about the  nearly random walks \" of animals is now challenged by the cumulated empirical observations , which indicate heavy - tailed displacement distributions approximated to a power - law form @xmath0 .",
    "examples include the foraging process and daily movements of wandering albatrosses @xcite , honeybees @xcite , spider monkeys @xcite , microzooplanktons @xcite , marine predators @xcite , and so on .",
    "these widespread observations imply a possible universal mechanism underlying animals mobility patterns .    interpretations of the animals mobility patterns can be divided into two classes .",
    "one is the _ optimal search strategies _",
    "@xcite , which indicate that animals can maximize the searching efficiency by using power - law movements .",
    "another is the _ deterministic walks _ ( dw )",
    "@xcite where a number of preys are randomly distributed on a field , and a walker will continuously catch the nearest prey from the current position .",
    "recent studies introduced many real - life factors into the standard framework of dw , such as olfactory - driven foraging @xcite and complex environment effects @xcite .",
    "to uncover the origin of scaling properties in animal mobility , we propose a variant dw model that takes into account the regeneration of resources in landscape and the least - action movements .",
    "our model can reproduce the power - law distribution of displacements , and the scaling behavior in probability density of having moved a certain distance at a certain time , agreeing well with the empirical observations .",
    "in addition , our model generates ordered collective movements of walkers with a quasi - periodic synchronization of walkers directions , indicating that the co - evolution of walkers least - action behavior and the landscape could be a potential origin of not only the individual mobility patterns , but also the population flocks .",
    "the food resources in the real environment can regenerate by themselves as the growth and propagation of plants and preys , until reaching a natural limitation of abundance .",
    "the maximization of foraging benefits and minimization of costs ( e.g. , the least - action movements ) usually underlie the animals behavior .",
    "our model takes into account these two fundamental ingredients .",
    "the environment is represented by a two - dimensional @xmath1 lattices with non - periodical boundary condition ( i.e. , walkers can not go across the boundary ) , and each lattice has prey resource @xmath2 ( for the lattice at coordinate @xmath3 ) .",
    "the maximum prey resource in each lattice is set as a fixed value @xmath4 .",
    "different from the standard dw , a more realistic case with multi - walkers ( the number of walkers is denoted by @xmath5 ) as well as their interactions are considered in our model .",
    "the updating rules about the landscape and walkers positions are as follows :    \\(i ) at each time step , each walker chooses the nearest lattice with the maximum prey resource to occupy at the next time step , and if there are more than one possible choices , the walker will randomly select one ( see fig .",
    "the movement is treated as instantaneous , namely the diversity of velocity is ignored .",
    "the displacement ( i.e. , moving length ) @xmath6 is defined as the geometric distance from the current occupied lattice to the next occupied lattice , namely , @xmath7 , where the coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively denote the current position and the next position of the walker .",
    "\\(ii ) the resource @xmath10 in the current occupied lattice of the walker is exhausted by the walker , namely @xmath11 .",
    "\\(iii ) for each lattice with @xmath12 ( currently not occupied by a walker ) , the resource increases an unit at each time step until @xmath13 , representing the regeneration of prey resources .",
    "\\(iv ) when the number of walkers @xmath14 , walkers update their positions with random order asynchronously according to the above algorithms at each time step .     in lattices are denoted by different gray scales , with pure - white for @xmath15 and dark black for @xmath16.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    because the resource in each lattice regenerates with a fixed speed , and each walker consumes at most @xmath4 resource at each time step , we define @xmath17 to express the ratio between the total consumption of walkers and the total regeneration speed of prey resource in the landscape , where @xmath18 is the area of the landscape .",
    "when @xmath19 , the consumption of prey resource is equal to the regeneration speed , and the resource is in a critical status . while if @xmath20 , the system has redundant resources . in our simulations ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath21 are tunable parameters , and the value of @xmath4 is determined by @xmath22 .",
    "noticed that the movements in our model are not purely  deterministic \" when @xmath23 or @xmath14 .",
    "this probabilistic property comes from two sources : one is the random order in the updating of walkers positions when @xmath14 , another is that a walker may have more than one choices for the next position .",
    "purely deterministic case appears only when @xmath19 and @xmath24 , in which the landscape has only one lattice with @xmath4 resource and the walker has to periodically repeat its early trajectories . in the cases that @xmath25 and @xmath14 , although it is possible that walkers exchange their trajectories under the treating with random order , the visited time on each lattice is still strict periodic if @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "other parameters are @xmath26 and @xmath27 . , title=\"fig:\",width=328 ] +    in our simulations",
    ", the size of landscape is fixed as @xmath28 .",
    "we assume the prey resource is full before a group of animals come into their habitat , thus we set the initial prey resource of each lattice to be @xmath4 , and the initial positions of walkers are randomly distributed in the landscape . except for the case of @xmath25 ,",
    "our simulations show that the move length distribution gets stable after the evolution of @xmath29 time steps , so our statistics take into account the walkers movement after @xmath29 time steps . when @xmath25 , the number of lattices having maximum resource is equal to the number of walkers @xmath5 in the steady state . in this case , each walker has to repeat its early trajectory or other walkers after the first @xmath30 time steps ( after that time , the consumption equals regeneration ) , so our statistics take into account the walkers movement after @xmath30 time steps .",
    "figure 2 shows the trajectories of a walker for different @xmath21 , where abundant long - range movements can be observed when @xmath21 approaches to @xmath31 .",
    "the move length distributions @xmath32 for different @xmath21 and @xmath5 are respectively shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "when @xmath21 approaches 1 , a scaling property of the move length distribution , say @xmath33 , can be observed .",
    "the analytical result for the move length distribution is given in the appendix , which agrees with the simulations .",
    "as mentioned above , when @xmath25 , the trajectory is periodic and thus at the last time step of a period , the walker returns to its origin , corresponding to a generally long displacement with the same order of the system size .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , when @xmath25 , a peak appears at @xmath34 .",
    "the dependence between the power - law exponent @xmath35 and the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath5 are shown respectively in the two inserts of fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "except @xmath25 , @xmath35 decreases monotonously with the increasing of @xmath21 .",
    "for example , when @xmath36 , @xmath35 decreases from @xmath37 to @xmath38 when @xmath21 changes from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "this range of @xmath35 covers almost all the known real - world observations of move length distributions of animals .",
    "this result indicates that the walker is more likely to take long - range movement when the prey resource is not rich enough , which is in accordance with the experiment on the prey behavior of bumble - bees @xcite and also is supported by the resent observation on the movements patterns of marine predators @xcite .",
    "our result suggests that the animals living in a habitat with abundant prey resource will not display scaling property in their mobility .     for different @xmath21 , where the inset shows the dependence between the power - law exponent @xmath35 and @xmath21 .",

    "4 . sometimes over half walkers are in these marching bands .",
    "marching bands are not stable",
    ". they may suddenly emerge or disappear , may grow larger or fall into pieces .",
    "we define an order parameter @xmath49 to measure the degree of synchronization of walkers directions at time step @xmath50 as the following form @xcite : @xmath51 where the velocity vector @xmath52 , and coordinate @xmath53 denotes the position of the @xmath54-th walker , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively denote the unit of velocity on the direction @xmath57-axis and @xmath58-axis . obviously , @xmath59 if all walkers have the same direction .",

    "6 , when @xmath47 , the order parameter will exceed @xmath60 , indicating a strong synchronization of individual s directions .",
    "collective movements can be only observed when @xmath21 is close to @xmath31 , which is also the condition for the emergence of scaling mobility patterns as mentioned in section iii .",
    "this property is demonstrated by the simulations shown in fig .",
    "6 , where one can see that the steady value of order parameter is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath21 , and when @xmath21 goes down from @xmath31 , the collective movements sharply disappear .",
    "notice that our model does not imply any direct interaction between walkers .",
    "they are driven by the co - evolution of resource landscape and the least - action movements .",
    "this feature is far different from most known interpretations on the dynamical mechanisms of animal collective movements @xcite , yet similar to the so - called active walk process @xcite , where the macroscopic - level structure emerges from the interplay between walkers and landscape .",
    "the existence of synchronized motions is very sensitive to the value of @xmath21 , suggesting that the food shortage may be responsible to the emergence of animal collective behaviors , which has also been observed for locusts @xcite .",

    "our model mimics the mobility patterns of many least - action walkers which prey in an landscape with regenerating ability . scaling laws of move length distribution",
    "emerges when the regeneration speed of prey resource approaches to the critical point that the amount of resource is just enough .",
    "this result indicates that the mobility patterns of animals are sensitive to the environmental context ( e.g. food resource ) , which is qualitatively supported by real observations @xcite .",
    "our model indicates that population also highly affects on the mobility patterns ( see the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , which is rarely discussed in early dw models . in addition",
    ", our model generates quasi - periodic collective movements with marching bands when @xmath66 indicating that the aggregations of animals are more likely to appear with food shortage @xcite , which is far different from many known dynamical interpretations based on the interaction between individuals @xcite .",
    "one of the noticeable features in our results is the coexistence of both scaling mobility patterns in individual level and collective movement in population level .",
    "both phenomena are under almost the same condition : the amount of prey resource approaches to the critical point , implying that the environment - driven mechanism may bridge the scaling individual activity patterns and global ordered behaviors .",
    "under different parameter settings , our results exhibit a wide and gradual spectrum of different mobility features : from the scaling movements to the random - walk - like mobility pattern , from ordered collective movements to the uncorrelated motions . these results are respectively well in agreement with different types of real - world mobility patterns of animals",

    "some phenomena , such as the logarithmic relation between @xmath35 and @xmath5 , and the microscopic mechanism in the emergence of such collective movements , are still open questions to us .    in a word , although our model is a minimum model that many real factors such as the diversity of velocity rates and the heterogeneity of environment are not considered , the results of our model are generally in agreement with many wild observations .",
