    "the rotational velocities obtained from gas observations are one of the most commonly used tools to study the mass distributions of spiral galaxies .",
    "it is often assumed that the gaseous motions are purely circular due to their low velocity dispersions .",
    "however , the presence of a galactic bar will induce non - circular motions due to the streaming along the bar .",
    "since bars account for two - thirds of nearby galaxies ( eg . ) , it is important to properly account for these motions .",
    "the study of the mass distribution is done by comparing the observed rc with the expected contributions from the gas , stars and dark matter , assuming axisymmetry , and that the gas is in circular motions ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the dark matter component ,",
    "an empirical or theoretical density profile is used .",
    "there are several dark matter density profiles suggested in the literature .",
    "the two most commonly used are the nfw profile @xcite derived from cosmological simulations with a central cusp and the isothermal ( iso ) model ( see e.g : @xcite ) with a central flat core ( see also : @xcite ) , a more general form of the dark matter density profile is also given by @xcite .",
    "alternative model such as the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite do not have a dark matter component .",
    "@xcite stipulated that there is no need for a dark matter halo to explain the flatness of galaxies rotation curves ( rcs ) if the law of gravity is modified below a critical acceleration a@xmath0 .",
    "a comparison between iso dark matter models and mond models , for a sample of dwarf and spiral galaxies , is given in @xcite but a larger sample is needed before a final conclusion can be made .    in order to distinguish between both these and other models , rcs that represent the gravitational potential are necessary .",
    "rcs are often derived from observed velocity maps of gas using the tilted ring method @xcite .",
    "this method divides the velocity map into co - centered rings and infers a variety of kinematic parameters , including the circular velocities .",
    "it has been implemented in the gipsy @xcite task rotcur .",
    "unfortunately , rotcur does not correct for the non - circular motions .",
    "there are other methods that have been developed to account for these motions , including the publicly available diskfit code @xcite .",
    "diskfit creates physical models from the observed rotation velocities and extract the non - circular motions using a @xmath1 minimization technique ( for more details see :) .",
    "diskfit has proven to be able to detect weak bars @xcite .",
    "it was specifically designed to fit a non - axisymmetric flow pattern to two - dimensional velocity maps @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the diskfit bar flow algorithm fails when the bar is almost parallel to the major or minor axis because of the degeneracy of the velocity components @xcite .",
    "@xcite used numerical models with pure rotation and compared the known circular velocities with the observed rotational velocities .",
    "they found that if a bar is perpendicular to the major axis of a galaxy , the measured rotational velocities and thus the mass is over estimated and the contrary if the bar is parallel to the major axis .",
    "we propose an alternate method to account for non - circular motions using n - body simulations . a grid of models with different bar orientations , strengths , and bulge - disk - halo compositions is generated .",
    "rcs from images of these models are made using rotcur , which are then compared to the rcs calculated from the gravitational potential and its derivatives .",
    "this comparison gives the corrections necessary for non - circular motions . to get the corrected rc for a real galaxy , the best corresponding model from the grid of simulations",
    "is selected and the corrections derived from the simulation are applied to the actual galaxy s rc derived from rotcur .",
    "the paper is organised as follow : section [ data ] describes the details of both the numerical simulations and the rotcur and diskfit algorithms .",
    "section [ res ] compares the rcs derived from the simulations using rotcur and diskfit to the rc obtained from the gravitational potential . in section [ case ]",
    "we describe our new method of correcting rcs and use ngc 3319 as a test case to show the importance of properly accounting for non - circular motions in mass models .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we use a series of spiral galaxy simulations , with different hubble types , sa , sb , sd , fitted to observed rotation velocities ( cf ) and different radial distributions of dark matter , with either a core or a cusp in the center , and different dark - to - visible mass ratios ( maximum disk or not ) .",
    "they give a range of rotation velocities with various shapes , rising more or less slowly with radius .",
    "we do not vary the total mass of the galaxies , since only the shapes of the rotation velocities are important , and masses can be varied by a change of units . it is acknowledged that there is a mass and size evolution along the hubble sequence ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and that late - type spiral galaxies are lighter and smaller , but these can be taken into account afterwards through rescaling .",
    "for all galaxy models , the total mass inside 35 kpc is 2.4 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 , with 75% in dark matter and 25% in baryons , for the standard model ( based on the @xmath4cdm cosmology ) and equality between baryons and dark matter for the maximum disk model .",

    "the projection angle pa was varied between 10 to 180 degrees in order to cover a wide range of intrinsic bar orientations for all the snapshots .",
    "we select the snapshots where the bar has reached a quasi - stationary state ( most of the gas have been converted into stars ) , but is still strong enough , and there is enough gas remaining in the disk to sample the rotation velocities with gas only .",
    "indeed , the simulations do not take into account gas accretion form the cosmic filaments , and the gas density is progressively reduced by star formation .",
    "rotcur uses the tilted - ring method @xcite , which divides the observed velocity field into concentric rings and estimates the circular velocities and other kinematical parameters such as position angle ( pa ) and inclination using a @xmath1 minimization technique .",
    "this method assumes that the gas is moving purely along circular orbits .",
    "each ring is characterized by the rotation center x@xmath14 and y@xmath14 , the systemic velocity v@xmath15 , the expansion velocity v@xmath16 ( assumed here to be zero ) , the inclination angle and pa .",

    "the top panels of figure [ stck1 ] shows that the measured rotation velocities using rotcur and the expected rotation velocities are in good agreement even if the bar is perpendicular with the major axis .",

    "we have presented the analysis of snapshot observations of n - body / hydrodynamic simulations of barred spiral galaxies with different bar strengths and orientations to quantify the non - circular motions induced by a bar . .",
    "in the simulations , the bar forms naturally due to gravitational instabilities .",
    "therefore , snapshots of simulated galaxies spanning a wide range of bar strengths and bar orientations can be extracted and analyzed .",
    "several models with different morphological types and dark matter halo distributions are analysed .    the results from the tilted ring method using rotcur show that the rotational velocities are largely under - estimated if the bar is parallel to the major axis and over - estimated if the bar is perpendicular except for an sa galaxy which has an important central bulge for both simulations .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the elongated orbits of the gas along the bar , which enhance the velocities at pericenter and reduce them at apocenter .",
    "part of the gas and dust are moving alongside the bar which increases the measured circular velocity when the bar is parallel to the major axis and decreases it if the bar is aligned with the minor axis .",

    "@xcite noted that the circular velocity is biased low when the bar is parallel to the major axis ( apocentre ) since the gas follows an elliptical pattern and that the circular speed should be higher when the bar is aligned with the minor axis .",
    "the test case in section [ case ] shows that the distribution of mass in ngc 3319 is very affected by the non - circular motions induced by the bar .",
    "for example , the central dark matter core is much more compact when the corrected rc is used .",
    "the iso and nfw results are very different in all cases for the corrected and uncorrected rcs .    for future",
    "work , snapshot observations with different bar strengths and orientations will be studied to estimate the corrections that need to be applied to the observed rotation velocities of a sample of barred galaxies with a variety of bar strength and bar orientation .",
    "a sample of barred galaxies with different bar sizes and orientations will be selected and modeled .",
    "this will help us to compare the results from the observations and the simulations for the individual galaxies.the main aim of this future work is to try to match as closely as possible the parameters of the model and the parameters of the galaxies , especially those of the bar .",

    "a total number of particles of 240 000 is distributed on the grid , and the density is computed with the cloud in cell algorithm ( cic ) . the gas is represented by sticky particles , colliding with inelastic collisions . at each encounter , the relative velocity of the clouds is multiplied by 0.65 in the radial direction , and 1 in the tangential direction , which keeps the angular momentum conserved .",

    "we parametrized the star formation efficiency for a sph particle as @xmath101 , with the constant c chosen such that the unperturbed giant disc galaxies form stars with a gas depletion time - scale of 2 gyr .",
    "this is equivalent to a kennicutt - schmidt law of exponent 1.5 .    to avoid to form too small stellar particles ,",
    "we adopt the method of hybrid particles , where progressively the gas particles contain a stellar fraction for a certain time - scale , until the remaining gas fraction falls below 5% .",
    "then the particle is transferred to the stellar component , and the gas is distributed over neighboring hybrid particles .    the stellar feedback is implemented both with stellar mass loss , and through supernovae .",
    "it is assumed that a percentage of 1% of the young stellar population is becoming a supernova , i.e. all stars more massive than 8 m@xmath3 , and the assumption of instantaneous recycling .",
    "the released mass also enriches the metallicity of the surrounding gas .    the stellar mass - loss at each time step ,",
    "is accounted for by the method described by , and allows a more progressive metal enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "the dynamics of the gas in disk galaxies are very complex systems and difficult to reproduce in numerical simulations . therefore , to test the influence of our assumptions on the gas treatment on our results , we have considered the same simulations , with the same initial conditions , but run with the tree - sph code , used in the galmer data - base ( cf ) .",
    "the main features of the sph - tree code for this particular simulation and also our treatment of star formation and feedback , are described in the appendix [ apa ] .",
    "the gas , which was considered essentially as an ensemble of dense clouds , dissipating their kinetic energy in collisions , is now considered as a fluid with pressure forces and shocks .",
    "the simulations have twice more particles , and the softening length is twice smaller , so that the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic is larger . the velocity maps and other results from the galmer project",

    "figures [ sph1 ] and [ sph2 ] display the results with the tree - sph code for the gsa and gsb galaxies , corresponding to figure [ stck1 ] and [ stck2 ] with the fft - sticky particles code .",
    "the gas behaviour is different , as expected , but the global feature due to the bar , the perturbations of the rc , are similar .",
    "for the orientation where the bar is parallel to the line of sight , the discrepancy between the true circular velocity and the `` observed '' rotational velocity is even larger , since the spatial resolution is higher . in the fft - sticky particles simulations ,",
    "the high velocity gradient was a bit smoothed out .",
