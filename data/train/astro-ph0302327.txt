    "recent investigations of nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have established that a significant fraction of the energy of seyfert galaxies may be provided by starburst activity and that at least some starburst galaxies have compact agn cores . as a result , many observational examples of starburst occurring in active galaxies have been found @xcite , strengthening the possible connection between active galaxies and circumnuclear starburst activity .    among the many indicators that may signal the presence of a circumnuclear starburst in agn are stellar absorption features in ultraviolet spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , emission signatures of wolf - rayet stars @xcite ; ca triplet absorption at 8555   @xcite and the presence of a featureless continuum @xcite . however , except for a very few cases , circumnuclear starburst has rarely been detected in seyfert 1 galaxies using the above techniques .",
    "most of the detections came from seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "a much more sensitive tracer of powerful starburst activity , proposed by @xcite , is the mass to light ratio at 1.65@xmath0 m ( @xmath4 ) , derived from the observed stellar flux and velocity dispersion of the stellar absorption features of si at 1.59@xmath0 m , co(6,3 ) at 1.62@xmath0 m , and co(2,0 ) at 2.29@xmath0 m .",
    "although this test has been successfully applied to obscured agn ( i.e@xmath1 seyfert 2 s ) , it has lead , again , to the non - detection of starburst activity in genuine seyfert 1 galaxies . in the light of the unified model for agn @xcite ,",
    "the above results are not readily explained .",
    "if there exist a connection between agn and starburst , one would expect to observe an even distribution of circumnuclear star - forming regions among the two types of seyferts .",
    "is the lack of a starburst component in type 1 agn a real effect or it does exists but is hidden by the much stronger radiation from the central engine ?    in the last decade , spectroscopy in the wavelength range 3@xmath14@xmath0 m has proben to be an effective way to detect the presence of starburst activity by means of the emission features at 3.3@xmath0 m and sometimes at 3.4@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the advantage of observing in this region is clear . in the uv and optical bands ,",
    "emission from agn in seyfert 2s is much weaker than in seyfert 1s due to large dust extinction , so detection of compact starbursts is technically much easier in the former than in the later .",
    "however , at 34@xmath0 m , dust extinction is much lower ( a@xmath5/a@xmath6 = 0.06 ; @xcite )",
    ". flux attenuation of agn emission at 34@xmath0 m differs only by a factor of 2 - 5 between seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s if a@xmath6 toward the obscured agn in the later is 10 - 30 mag ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at 34@xmath0 m , detection of the compact nuclear starbursts in sy1s is not so difficult compared to sy2s . given that the compact nuclear starbursts have been detected in sy2s , their detection in sy1s is also feasible .",
    "emission features at 3.3@xmath0 m and 3.4@xmath0 m has been attributed to large molecules like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ; @xcite ) illuminated by ultraviolet photons from early type stars .",
    "they have been found to be prominent in pure starburst , infrared luminous galaxies and obscured agn @xcite and are associated to star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "the lack of available spectroscopic observations in seyfert 1 prevents to state if this test also fails in these objects . to our knowledge",
    ", mrk231 has been the only seyfert 1 galaxy observed in the 3@xmath14@xmath0 m region with the goal of detecting signals of starburst activity . a positive detection of the 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature in that object ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter id00 ) makes nir spectroscopy a promising technique .",
    "nonetheless , it should be keep in mind that in the close universe , mrk231 is the brightest active galaxy in the ir ( @xmath7=3.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 l ) .",
    "moreover , the existence of a strong oh maser source in its nucleus @xcite points , in fact , towards the existence of a strong starburst in its circumnuclear region .",
    "this letter reports the results of 3@xmath14@xmath0 m spectroscopy aimed at detecting hidden starburst activity in type 1 agn and quantifying its importance to the ir energetics . in ",

    "it corresponds to the inner 60 pc ; in mrk766 , the inner 150 pc and in mrk478 , the inner 1kpc .",
    "these values represents , by far , the best observational estimates on the location of a circumnuclear starburst in seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos .    in mrk1239 ,",
    "ngc4051 and 1h1934 - 063 , no clear evidence for the 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission is observed and only upper limits to its flux could be derived ( see table  [ pah_flux ] ) .",
    "the lack of pah emission is interpreted as either they are unobscured agn with no significant circumnuclear star - formation activity or if there is any starburst component , it is located outside the inner few hundred parsecs of the nucleus . a third possibility may be related to the correlation between agn activity and active star - forming host proposed by im02 : the most powerful monsters live in the more actively star - forming host galaxies .",
    "for instance , it is well known that ngc4051 is one of the weakest seyfert 1 nuclei @xcite .",
    "if the correlation is valid , it would imply a very low level of star formation in this object , probably outside the detection limits .",

    "note that for this later object , l photometry was derived from k photometry.,width=321 ]    it is important to note the presence of an emission feature at 3.45@xmath0 m in the spectrum of mrk1239 , as can be seen in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] . in the remaining 5 objects ,",
    "none is seen at this position , either in emission or in absorption .",
    "no previous report of such an emission were found in the literature for an extragalactic object .",
    "reports of an absoption feature at 3.4@xmath0 m , attributted to carbonaceous dust grain , exist for seyfert 2 ( @xcite ; id00 ; im02 ) and composite starburst / obscured agn galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite detected an emission feature of unclear origin at 3.43@xmath0 m in the spectrum of elias1 , a herbig ae source . whether the emission seen in mrk1239",
    "is related to the 3.4@xmath0 m absorption or to the stellar 3.43@xmath0 m emission is not possible to tell from our data .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that no clear evidence of the 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission is seen on this source and that it is the only object in which the 3.4@xmath0 m is observed gives support to the hypothesis that the 3.3@xmath0 m and 3.4@xmath0 m features are unrelated @xcite .",
    "several important points arise from the data listed in tables  [ basic ] and  [ pah_flux ] , mainly when compared to the information available in the literature for pure starburst and seyfert 2 galaxies .    even in the presence of starburst activity ,",
    "small 3.3@xmath0 m pah equivalent widths ( hereafter ew@xmath17 ) in agn is most likely caused by the strong continuum emitted by circumnuclear dust heated by the central source , which peaks at the 3@xmath0 m to 4@xmath0 m region .",
    "for that reason , it is not surprising to find that the average ew@xmath17 measured in our galaxy sample is 44@xmath1810  , excluding the upper limits detections , and 27  , including them . considering that starburst - dominated galaxies show ew@xmath17 in the interval 600@xmath12400    ( id00 )",
    ", we deduce that more than 90% of the continuum flux in the 3.3@xmath0 m region originates from dust heated by the agn in seyfert 1 . for seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "nearly 80 % of the 34 @xmath0 m continuum is also related to agn activity ( im02 ) .",
    "however , low ew@xmath17 does not necessarily means that the ir emission ( 8@xmath11000@xmath0 m ) is also dominated by the agn contribution .",
    "a first approach to estimate the relative importance of a hidden starburst is to compare the ir and 3.3@xmath0 m luminosities .",
    "following @xcite , the l@xmath19 is obtained using the 12@xmath0 m , 25@xmath0 m , 60@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m @xmath20 fluxes , also listed in table  [ basic ] .",
    "the l@xmath17/l@xmath19 ratios derived for the objects of our sample are shown in column 5 of table  [ pah_flux ] .",
    "we found that they are rather similar to those measured in the seyfert 2 galaxy sample of im02 . the most striking result",
    ", however , is for mrk478 .",
    "the l@xmath17/l@xmath21 ratio for this source reaches 0.56@xmath810@xmath22 , more than half of the typical value found for starburst dominated galaxies ( l@xmath17/l@xmath231@xmath810@xmath22 ; @xcite ) . the assumption that 0.1% of the ir luminosity in starburst galaxies is converted into 3.3@xmath0 m emission",
    "has later been supported by several works ( i.e. , @xcite ; im02 ) .",
    "the above means that mrk478 harbors a powerful hidden compact starburst region , not detected by optical and/or uv spectroscopy .",
    "mrk766 and ngc3227 , the other two seyfert 1 galaxies with clear identification of the 3.3@xmath0 m feature show l@xmath17/l@xmath21 ratios typical of those measured in seyfert 2 galaxies . as for mrk478",
    ", mrk766 has no signs of circumnuclear star formation in the visible or uv region .",
    "this suggests that the lack of detection of starburst activity in seyfert1 galaxies and qsos by means of uv and optical indicators can be due to the strong contribution of the agn radiation to the observed continuum rather than to a truly deficit of star - forming regions in these objects .",
    "a more definite conclusion on this issue should be reached as soon as observations of a larger number of objects become available .",
    "but it is clear that had we applied any of the diagnostics usually employed to search for starburst in agn ( see  1 ) only one out of the six galaxies of our sample ( ngc3227 ) would present signs of active star formation .",
    "several pieces of evidence give additional support to our results and suggest a tight correlation between the 3.3@xmath0 m pah and molecular co emission .",
    "@xcite observed a sample of 10 infrared - excess optically selected qsos from the palomar - green ( pg ) bright quasar survey with the goal of establishing whether or not quasi - stellar objects reside in molecular - rich galaxies as well as determining how the infrared and molecular gas properties of qsos compare with those of ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "mrk478 is among the objects showing millimetre co(1@xmath240 ) emission . according to @xcite results",
    ", this qso shows one of the largest co luminosities and a very high h@xmath25 molecular mass ( 8.0 @xmath8 10@xmath26 m ) .",
    "it means that mrk478 lives in a host galaxy containing significant supply of molecular gas , capable of igniting and sustaining both agn and star formation activity .",
    "all the qsos of @xcite sample have high values of @xmath27 . in starburst galaxies ,",
    "that ratio is commonly referred to as the star formation efficiency .",
    "large values of @xmath27 in agn can be interpreted as due to either dust heating by the qso or to star formation intimately connected to the qso phenomenon .",
    "the presence of the 3.3@xmath0 m feature in mrk478 and the high l@xmath17/l@xmath21 ratio , similar to that observed in irlgs and pure starburst objects , clearly points out to the second possibility .",
    "in addition , if this hypothesis is correct and the co emission comes primarily for the starburst component , our data sets important constraints to the region where it is located : the inner 1kpc .",
    "similar results are obtained for ngc3227 .",
    "using nicmos imaging , @xcite found an extended h@xmath25 emission that lies in a 100pc diameter `` disk '' with a major p.a @xmath13100@xmath28 , probably associated with large quantities of dense molecular material .",
    "variations in the distribution and velocity components observed in [ o ] and h@xmath29+[n ] on this source by @xcite suggest that star formation is vigorous in its central region .",
    "in addition , from the co velocity field maps , @xcite found evidence that a warped molecular disk is present in the inner 70pc of this galaxy .",
    "our 3.3@xmath0 m pah detection in ngc3227 is in total agreement with the above results and confirms the presence of a circumnuclear starburst in this galaxy .",
    "moreover , the size of the emitting pah region , constrained to the central 60pc , is coincident with the size of the co molecular disk , suggesting a close connection between these two features .",
    "co observations of mrk766 have failed to detect significant emission of molecular gas in this object .",
    "however , @xcite derived an upper limit for its h@xmath25 mass and found it to be 4.4 @xmath8 10@xmath30 m , almost 20 times lower than that of mrk478 .",
    "nonetheless , co observations of ngc3227 by these same authors allowed them to derived an h@xmath25 mass of 1.6 @xmath8 10@xmath30 m , 3 times smaller than the upper limit found for mrk766 .",
    "putting together the co and 3.3@xmath0 m pah measurements for mrk478 , mrk766 and ngc3227 it appears that they are intimately related and connected to the star formation phenomenon .",
    "the apparent lack of circumnuclear starburst in type 1 agn has been analysed using medium resolution spectroscopy in the near - infrared for 5 seyfert 1 galaxies and one qso .",
    "a clear identification of the 3.3 @xmath2 m pah emission , usually associated to star formation activity , was obtained in mrk 478 , mrk766 and ngc3227 .",
    "upper limits for the 3.3@xmath0 m flux was derived for the remaining objects .",
    "the values of the 3.3@xmath0 m pah equivalent widths are very similar to those found in seyfert2 galaxies known to host a circumnuclear starburst .",
    "it suggests that agn of type 1 and 2 present a comparable level of star - formation activity but probably in the former type of objects it is hidden by the direct view of the central radiation .",
    "although more than 90% of the continuum flux at 3.3@xmath0 m was found to be associated to the agn , in mrk478 and mrk766 the l@xmath17/l@xmath21 ratio , a measurement of the energetic contribution of the starburst to the 8@xmath11000@xmath0 m continuum , is comparable to the values measured in infrared luminous galaxies and pure starburst galaxies .",
    "this result indicates that the ir luminosity in these two objects is significantly powered by a starburst component .",
    "co observations in the millimetre region support this scenario .",
    "a large mass of molecular gas is derived in the objects with clear identification of the 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "this gas is most probably located in the same region where the pah is emitted , providing significant fuel capable of igniting and sustaining both agn and star formation activity .",
