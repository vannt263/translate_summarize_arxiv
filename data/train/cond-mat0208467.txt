    "the layered ruthenium oxides sr@xmath1ruo@xmath4 , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , and the perovskites srruo@xmath0 and caruo@xmath0 , have attracted much attentions during the last several years primarily because these systems allow quantum phase transitions in clean metals @xcite to be addressed experimentally .",
    "the appearances of novel transitions associated with the correlated 4@xmath3 electrons continues to stir up significant issues within the condensed matter community .",
    "the layered member sr@xmath1ruo@xmath4 , for example , enters a superconducting state at about 1 k in association with a rather unusual spin - triplet type electron - pairing , clearly at odds with predictions of conventional @xmath5wave superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the bilayered member , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , shows non - fermi liquid transport in the vicinity of a metamagnetic transition at high magnetic field and low temperature , suggesting that the scattering rate of the conduction electrons may be influenced by quantum fluctuations , as opposed to more conventional thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "finally , data suggest that a quantum critical point exists in the solid solution sr@xmath6ca@xmath7ruo@xmath0 for @xmath80.7 between ferromagnetic ( sr - side ) and nearly ferromagnetic ( ca - side ) ordered states .",
    "these materials have provided experimental opportunities to study criticality of correlated electrons in the vicinity of the quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "the present status of investigations of quantum phase transitions and criticality seem far behind that of the conventional transitions that are driven by thermal fluctuations @xcite . in order to promote progress in the studies of quantum phase transitions and criticality in clean metals , and to answer many open questions aroused thus far , we need further opportunities to study these issues experimentally . searching for a new class of materials which show quantum critical behavior within realizable magnetic , pressure , or chemical ranges , should be encouraged .",
    "high - quality single crystals of these materials , if available , would be highly desirable for experimental investigations .",
    "we have been synthesizing the variety of compounds in the sr - rh(iv ) oxide system , where rh is expected to be 4@xmath9 , by applying high - temperature and high - pressure techniques at typically 6 gpa and 1500 @xmath10c @xcite . besides the counted members of the strontium - rhodium system ,",
    "the perovskite - type compound was recently obtained by quenching to room temperature at elevated pressure @xcite .",
    "the formation of srrho@xmath0 was an excellent example of what can be achieved by high - pressure techniques  no compounds at the ratio sr : rh = 1:1 had ever been reported until the high - pressure experiment . while the sr substitution for larh@xmath11o@xmath0 was studied by a regular solid - state - reaction technique at ambient pressure ; it was then found that the solubility limit of sr at the la site was at most 10 % , and the solid solution remained semiconducting in the very narrow region @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that the formation of the 100 % end - member srrho@xmath0 goes far beyond the limit achieved by the regular synthesis study , and it is indicative of the dramatic effectiveness of the high - pressure experiment .",
    "this synthesis technique can be expected to uncover further novel electronic materials in addition to srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic and electrical properties of srrho@xmath0 were qualitatively similar of those observed in the analogous ruthenium oxide caruo@xmath0 , the latter being a nearly ordered ferromagnetic metal that is probably influenced by spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "we had therefore expected unusual electronic properties in the unforeseen compounds in the rhodium oxide system , as well as the analogous ruthenium oxides .",
    "we have focused our attention to obtaining further novel materials in the sr - rh - o space , and thus far , the ruddlesden - popper - type member sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 was found . in this paper",
    "we present data from neutron diffraction study , magnetic and electrical measurements on a polycrystalline sample of this new phase , and the results are compared to the ruthenium analogue .",

    "the fine and pure ( @xmath12 ) powders of sro@xmath1 , rh@xmath1o@xmath0 , and rh were mixed at the compositions sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath13 , where @xmath14 0.0 and 0.1 .",
    "approximately 0.2 grams of each stoichiometry was placed into a platinum capsule and then compressed at 6 gpa in a high - pressure apparatus , which was originally developed in our laboratory @xcite .",
    "the sample was then heated at 1500 @xmath10c for 1 hr and quenched to room temperature before releasing the pressure .",
    "the quality of the products was investigated by means of powder x - ray diffraction ( cuk@xmath15 ) .",
    "the x - ray profile was carefully obtained at room temperature using the high - resolution - powder diffractometer ( rint-2000 system , developed by rigaku , co ) , which was equipped with a graphite monochromator on the counter side .",
    "we found that the both samples were of high quality ; there were no significant impurities in either product , and no remarkable difference between them .",
    "the x - ray pattern for the powder sample at @xmath14 0.0 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    "approximately 30 milligrams of the @xmath14 0.0 powder was slowly heated at 5 @xmath10c / min in a gas mixture ( 3% hydrogen in argon ) and held at 800 @xmath10c until the weight reduction became saturated .",
    "calculated oxygen composition from the weight loss data was 7.01 per formula unit , indicating good oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "another sample of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 , prepared at identical synthesis condition , was used for structural study by means of neutron diffraction .",
    "the powder neutron data of powder sample of sr@xmath0rh@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath190.2 grams ) were collected at room temperature using the bt-1 high - resolution powder diffractometer at the nist center for neutron research , employing a cu(311 ) monochromator to produce a monochromatic neutron beam of wavelength 1.5396  .",

    "the degree of local structure distortions , such as cooperative rotations of metal - oxygen octahedra and frequency of stacking faults in the layered structure , may depend sensitively on the synthesis conditions .",
    "technical problems , such as small sample volume within the high - pressure apparatus and uncertainties in the maximum temperature during the heating process , could contribute to small variations in sample quality .",
    "measuring an individual pellet by neutron powder diffraction was intended to preclude possible errors in the analysis of the local structural distortion .",

    "cooperative rotations along @xmath31axis of the rho@xmath32 octahedra are indicated by circular arrows.,width=302 ]    the major concern in the structure investigation of the title compound was whether a cooperative rotation of the metal - oxygen octahedra occurs as is found in the analogous sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite . in the study of the @xmath33 oxide by means of neutron diffraction , eight independent modes for the cooperative rotation ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , combinations of some of those , and the rotation - free mode ( @xmath42 ) were tested .",
    "it was found that the @xmath35 mode resulted in the highest quality of the profile analysis @xcite . here ,",

    "the isotropic atomic displacement parameter ( @xmath47 ) of the rhodium ion ( 8@xmath48site ) is rather unusual , possibly because the low level of the intensity statistics reduced reliability of the thermal parameters somewhat .",
