    "@xmath0 production by real and virtual photons provides an effective way to test qcd dynamics at short distances and to verify qcd inspired models .",
    "the pomeron exchange model is one of the nonperturbative qcd approaches traditionally applied  @xcite to vector meson photoproduction at high energies .",
    "the crucial point of the model is the flavour independence of the pomeron - quark interaction , which can be studied through systematic analysis of the photoproduction of light , strange , charm and beauty quarks .",
    "the perturbative qcd models , such as two gluon exchange  @xcite and photon - gluon fusion  @xcite , provide a direct access to the gluon distribution function .",
    "the @xmath0 electro and photoproduction is an excellent tool to test the gluon parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "@xmath0 electroproduction has been systematically studied within these different approaches .",
    "most modern gluon distribution functions , such as mrst2001  @xcite and cteq6  @xcite became available just recently through the analysis of @xmath0 electroproduction at large @xmath3 . very recently",
    "the data on @xmath0 electro production were analyzed  @xcite with the photon - gluon fusion model .",
    "here we present a systematic analysis of @xmath0 production by real photons .",
    "we collect old data available at low energies  @xcite as well as data at high energies  @xcite from h1 and zeus .",
    "we also include very recently published results  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate whether @xmath0 photoproduction can be understood in terms of a certain model , which is also applicable to the photoproduction of other vector mesons .",
    "it is also a crucial line of our study whether the qcd or pqcd models are able to explain the mechanism of @xmath0 photoproduction close to the reaction threshold , i.e. at @xmath4  gev .",
    "the @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 vector mesons , which are the mixtures of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks states , have the same quantum numbers . for ideal mixing , @xmath12 is near 35@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while the @xmath5 meson is built up with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , the mixing is not ideal and both the @xmath7 and @xmath0 vector mesons contain a certain fraction of light quarks .",
    "systematic regge theory analysis  @xcite of @xmath5 meson photoproduction shows that at large invariant collision energies , @xmath16  gev , the reaction is dominated by soft pomeron exchanges , while at @xmath17  gev additional small contribution might come from the hard pomeron . at low energies , @xmath4  gev ,",
    "the @xmath5 photoproduction is dominated by the meson exchanges .",
    "the regge model with contributions from @xmath18 and @xmath19 trajectories reasonably describes the data as well as the standard meson exchange model with @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 contributions .",
    "particularly large contribution from @xmath18 meson exchange to @xmath5 photoproduction at low energies can be understood through the large @xmath22 partial decay width , which dominates the @xmath5 meson radiative decay mode .",
    "an absolutely different situation holds for the @xmath0 meson . following the regge theory",
    "it is believed that at high energies the @xmath0 meson is produced through soft and hard pomeron exchanges , where the last dominates at @xmath23  gev .",
    "it is hard to classify what mechanism is responsible for @xmath0 photoproduction at low energies , below @xmath24  gev .",
    "the @xmath0 mass @xmath25  gev is below the @xmath26 threshold @xmath27  gev and ozi  @xcite allowed @xmath28 decay can not not be realized in vacuum .",
    "instead there are large amount of ozi suppressed decay channels involving stable hadrons , hadronic resonances and radiative decays  @xcite . a large fraction of radiative @xmath0 decay proceeds through the production of multi mesonic resonant and non resonant states .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 both constitute a negligible part of the total radiative decay modes , thus the single meson exchanges contribution to @xmath0 photoproduction are expected to be very small .    however , it might be that the mesonic or multi mesonic exchange contribution to @xmath31 is negligible and the soft pomeron exchange dominates already starting from the reaction threshold .",
    "the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 total photoproduction cross section is illustrated by fig.[psiju6 ] , where the reduced total photoproduction cross section @xmath32 is shown as a function of photon energy , @xmath33 .",
    "the upper axis of fig.[psiju6 ] indicates the invariant collision energy @xmath34 , where @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the nucleon mass .",
    "the @xmath5 photoproduction data are shown by squares and were collected in ref .",
    "the circles show the @xmath6 data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the results available until 1985 were reviewed .",
    "the part of the @xmath6 photoproduction data  @xcite were obtained with the nuclear target and therefore should be considered as an average between the proton and neutron .",
    "the @xmath6 photoproduction threshold is @xmath37  gev .",
    "the cornell measurement  @xcite is the only result available now for @xmath6 photoproduction close to the reaction threshold .",
    "we note that the @xmath6 photoproduction data measured at @xmath38  gev at cornell were incorrectly reviewed in ref .",

    "the total photoproduction cross section is therefore @xmath42  nb , taking into account the minimal four momentum transfer squared .",
    "the triangles in fig.[psiju6 ] show the @xmath6 photoproduction data , which appeared after 1985 and are published in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the energy dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath31 is different at all photon energies .",
    "it is known that this difference was discovered after the h1 and zeus measurements  @xcite at @xmath23  gev .",
    "fig.[psiju7 ] show the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reduced differential photoproduction cross section , @xmath44 , extrapolated to zero four momentum transfer squared @xmath45 as a function of photon energy @xmath33 and invariant collision energy @xmath34 .",
    "the energy dependence of the forward photoproduction cross sections again indicates a strong difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 data .",
    "our meaning of the forward photoproduction cross section is an extrapolation of @xmath46 to @xmath45 .",
    "another value of interest is the exponential slope @xmath47 of @xmath48 dependence of the differential photoproduction cross section , which is defined as @xmath49 and is shown in fig.[psiju2a ] .",
    "the @xmath5 photoproduction data can be well fitted with a constant slope @xmath50",

    "gev@xmath51 , while at high energies @xmath54  gev@xmath51 .",
    "finally , the available experimental results on @xmath5 and @xmath0 meson photoproduction might indicate a rather different mechanism for their production . although , the quantum numbers of @xmath5 and @xmath0 are the same , they have different quark structures .",
    "the difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath0 photoproduction data can be attributed to the difference between the properties of light and charm quarks , such as their interaction through the gluon exchange , confinement and fusion into real hadrons and photon quark - antiquark fluctuation .",
    "therefore , currently available theoretical models for @xmath5 and @xmath0 meson photoproduction are inspired by qcd .    in the next section",
    "we review some of the models that recently were successfully applied to the @xmath0 electroproduction off the nucleon .",
    "we will compare these models with data on @xmath0 photoproduction by real photons .",
    "furthermore , we consider all available data on @xmath0 photoproduction in order to make our study in a more systematic way .",
    "the basis of the model is the factorization of the exclusive vector meson photoproduction amplitude in terms of the product of @xmath55 fluctuation , the scattering of the @xmath56 system by the proton and finally the @xmath56 hadronization into a vector meson .",

    "furthermore , @xmath48 is the squared four momentum transfer and @xmath72 is the proton isoscalar em form factor given as @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the proton mass and @xmath75=0.71  gev@xmath41 .",

    "the constant @xmath79 is not well defined theoretically and can be taken as @xmath80 following the dual model prescription  @xcite .",
    "the free model parameter , @xmath81 , determines the strength of the effective pomeron coupling to the quark , while @xmath82 accounts for the possibility that the coupling to an off - shell quark is not pointlike but dressed with the form factor given by the last term of eq.([spom ] ) .",
    "both @xmath81 and , in principle , @xmath82 might depend on the flavour of the quark and can be fixed by experimental data .",
    "the phase of the soft pomeron exchange amplitude was not written explicitly in refs .",
    "@xcite since no interference with other exchanges was considered .",
    "the amplitude is normalized so that @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the differential @xmath84 cross section due to soft pomeron exchange is given for a real photon as , @xmath85 where it was assumed that @xmath86 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath81 and the form factor @xmath82 were fitted  @xcite through the systematical analysis of @xmath5 meson photoproduction as @xmath87 it was found  @xcite that the parameter @xmath81 evaluated from @xmath5 photoproduction was different from @xmath81=2.0  gev@xmath88 needed in the description  @xcite of @xmath89 photoproduction data .",
    "this discrepancy could not be explained in a satisfactory way , since once the parameters of the pomeron exchange are fixed by @xmath89 meson photoproduction , they should be applicable to the other vector mesons as well . moreover ,",
    "at this stage we still do not discuss the flavour dependence of the quark - pomeron interaction , because we are dealing with @xmath89 and @xmath5 photoproduction , i.e. light @xmath90 states .",
    "an ideal illustration of this finding is given by the ratio of the @xmath43 and @xmath91 cross sections , shown in fig .",
    "[ reg12a ] as a function of photon energy @xmath33 and invariant collision energy @xmath34 . following eq.([pom1 ] ) the ratio of @xmath5 and @xmath89 meson photoproduction",

    "[ reg12a ] shows the fit to the data by a constant value @xmath95 , which is close to the @xmath96 estimates for the @xmath5 and @xmath89 coupling to the photon .",
    "finally the difference between the regge model and the data accounts for a factor of @xmath971.3 .",
    "it is already clear that both @xmath89 and @xmath5 photoproduction data could not be reproduced by the soft pomeron exchange simultaneously with the same set of parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "now , the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ psiju6 ] shows the contribution from soft pomeron exchange to the total reduced @xmath5 meson photoproduction cross section .",

    "the contribution from soft pomeron exchange to forward @xmath5 meson photoproduction is shown in fig .",
    "[ psiju7 ] by the dashed line .",
    "obviously , the soft pomeron exchange alone will reproduce the @xmath5 photoproduction data at @xmath98  gev . at lower energies",
    "the dominant contribution to the @xmath43 reaction comes from meson exchanges .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence of the photoproduction cross section arising from the soft pomeron exchange is given by the proton em form factor squared @xmath99 , the quark - pomeron form factor squared and by the pomeron exchange trajectory @xmath100 .",

    "the slope due to the proton isoscalar em form factor is @xmath102 and since it depends on @xmath48 it can be considered as a local slope . at @xmath45 the slope from proton em form factor is @xmath974.6 .",
    "the slope due to the quark - pomeron form factor squared is given as @xmath103 and depends on the cutoff parameter @xmath82 and mass of the produced vector meson @xmath71 .",
    "for @xmath5 meson photoproduction at @xmath48=0 the slope associated with the quark - pomeron form factor is @xmath974.0 .",
    "the energy dependence of the slope comes from pomeron trajectory and is given for soft pomeron exchange as @xmath104    finally , the total exponential slope , @xmath47 , of the @xmath48 dependence for @xmath5 meson photoproduction at @xmath48=0 has a minimum value of @xmath47=8.6  gev@xmath51 and increases logarithmically with energy .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the data shown in fig.[psiju2a ] .",
    "here we also show the local slope @xmath47 at different squared four momentum transfers @xmath48 .",
    "it is also clear that the appearance of the proton em form factor in the reaction amplitude dictates quite a large value of the minimal available @xmath47 at @xmath48=0 .",
    "the contribution from soft pomeron exchange to @xmath0 photoproduction is given by eq.([pom1 ] ) .",
    "taking the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 as determined from the data on @xmath5 meson photoproduction one can easy estimate the ratio of forward @xmath0 and @xmath5 photoproduction cross section as @xmath105 with @xmath106=5.26  kev .",
    "the experimental results shown in fig.[psiju7 ] indicate that this ratio is of order 0.005 at @xmath10710  gev .",
    "therefore the soft pomeron exchange with fixed parameters for the quark - pomeron interaction substantially overestimates the data on @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "however , since it was already realized that a simultaneous description of both @xmath89 and @xmath5 photoproduction data requires a different coupling constant @xmath81 , one might proceed in a similar way and readjust @xmath81 to the @xmath0 photoproduction data .    considering the flavour dependence of the interaction between the pomeron and quark one might distinguish the light quark coupling @xmath108=@xmath109=2.35  gev@xmath88 , which is taken to be the same as evaluated from @xmath5 meson photoproduction , and the pomeron coupling to charm quark @xmath110 . in that case the @xmath111 term in the amplitude given by eq.([spom ] )",
    "should be replaced by product @xmath112 .",
    "in addition the differential cross section of eq.([pom1 ] ) must also be corrected .",
    "we found that the choice of @xmath110=0.45  gev@xmath88 provides a reasonable description of the data around @xmath10710  gev .",
    "the dashed lines in figs.[psiju6],[psiju7 ] show our calculation of the soft pomeron contribution to the reduced total and forward @xmath0 photoproduction cross section .",
    "however , resolving the problem with the reduction of the soft pomeron contribution to @xmath0 photoproduction leaves one far short of a description of the @xmath0 meson data collected in figs.[psiju6],[psiju7],[psiju2a ] .",
    "first , although the soft pomeron seems to reproduce the total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section starting just from the reaction threshold , the model absolutely fails to describe the forward cross section and slope @xmath47 of the @xmath48 dependence at low energies .",
    "recall , that the minimal value of the slope is given by the proton scalar em form factor and this is already larger than the experimental results at low energies .",
    "second , the energy dependence of the total and forward @xmath0 photoproduction cross section and the slope @xmath47 at high energies can not be reproduced by soft pomeron exchange .",
    "there are different attempts to reproduce the energy dependence of the total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section without introducing a new pomeron trajectory .",
    "the strategy is to readjust the @xmath48 dependence in such a way that it becomes flatter , providing the correct total cross section after integration over the large @xmath48 region accessible at high energies .",
    "one of the more natural ways is to introduce a trajectory that is nonlinear in @xmath48 , instead of that given by eq.([tra1 ] ) .",
    "obviously the @xmath0 photoproduction data at @xmath48=0 , shown in fig.[psiju7 ] , do not support such solution .",
    "instead , the forward @xmath0 photoproduction cross section requires that at @xmath48=0 the cross section is proportional to @xmath34 , because the reduced cross section in fig.[psiju7 ] is almost independent of energy for @xmath110  gev . from eq.([base ] ) one can show that the trajectory necessary to reproduce the data has an intercept @xmath1131.25 .",
    "moreover , since the energy dependence of the slope , @xmath47 , is proportional to @xmath114 , the data shown in fig.[psiju2a ] support the value of @xmath1150  gev@xmath51 .",
    "the hard pomeron trajectory was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath116 the calculations with both hard and soft pomeron exchanges , including their interference , are shown by the solid lines in figs.[psiju6],[psiju7],[psiju2a ] .",
    "the coupling constant between the hard pomeron and charm quark was fitted as @xmath117=0.05  gev@xmath88 .",
    "the calculations reproduce quite well the data on total and forward @xmath0 photoproduction cross section and slope @xmath47 of @xmath48 dependence at @xmath11810  gev .",
    "note that for both soft and hard pomeron exchanges the partial slope @xmath119 , coming from the form factor in the upper pomeron - quark vertices , is @xmath1200.37 , because of the large @xmath0 mass appearing in eq.([slopeb1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the hard pomeron dominates at high energies .",
    "figs.[psiju4 ] shows the differential cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction at high energies .",
    "the data available at small @xmath48 can be described well by the model .    while the introduction of a hard pomeron exchange allows one to resolve inconsistencies at high energies , the discrepancies between the model and the data at @xmath12110  gev still remain .",

    "the dashed lines show the fit to the soft part of the differential spectra .",
    "the comparison between the differential spectra and calculations at @xmath12110  gev illustrates that both slope and extrapolated cross section at @xmath48=0 could not be reproduced by the model . the rough agreement between the integrated theoretical and experimental cross sections shown in fig.[psiju6 ]",
    "should be considered as an accident .",
    "the pomeron exchange model is far from describing the data at @xmath12110  gev .",
    "the comparison at @xmath10720  gev shows that pomeron exchange allows one to describe the steep dependence of the differential @xmath122 cross section at small @xmath48 . at large",

    "there are attempts to recover flavour independence by accounting for the mass - dependent corrections , such as fermi motion and quark off - shellness in the @xmath56 loop .",
    "indeed the vector meson coupling to @xmath56 introduced through eq.([meson ] ) was obtained within an on - shell approximation , which is not correct in the case of diffractive photoproduction .",

    "the model convoluted the the gluon momentum distribution and the photon - gluon cross section @xmath152 , which is given as @xmath153 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times\\ln\\left[\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\right ]   -\\beta[{\\tilde s}^2 + 4{\\tilde s}m_c^2]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the charge and mass of the charm quark , respectively , @xmath126 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath70 is electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath156 is squared invariant mass of the photon - gluon system and @xmath157    the pgf does not consider explicitly the formation of the final state , which should enter through the @xmath0 wave function as in the case of two gluon exchange model . instead",
    "the convolution of photon - gluon cross section with the gluon momentum distribution is performed over the range from charmonium production threshold , @xmath158 , up to the open charm production threshold @xmath159 , given by the mass of @xmath160 meson .",
    "finally the charmonium photoproduction cross section is @xmath161 where the factor , @xmath162 , is an adjustable parameter that accounts for the fraction of the specific charmonium bound states available in the mass region between @xmath158 and @xmath159 . for the @xmath0 meson",
    "we fit it as @xmath162=0.062 with @xmath155=1.3  gev .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath163=@xmath164 .",
    "the pgf calculations with different gluon distribution functions are shown in fig.[psiju3 ] , together with data on the total @xmath147 reaction cross section . obviously , the pgf is less sensitive to the type of gluon distribution functions in comparison to the two gluon exchange model . the calculations with mrst2001  @xcite and dl",
    "@xcite reproduce the data better than the results obtained with grv98  @xcite , which indicates a much steeper energy dependence .",
    "however the mrst2001 and grv98 distributions both have correct threshold behaviour , while dl - not . in principle",
    ", the dl gluon distribution function can be corrected in order to get the correct asymptotic behaviour as @xmath165 , by multiplying it with @xmath166 .",
    "however , then the agreement with the data disappears .",
    "the pgf model does not contain a @xmath48 dependence and in the best case it can be artifically introduced through the proton em form factor .",
    "although the pdf calculations are able to reproduce the cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction starting from threshold we would not claim that pqcd is able to describe the data at @xmath16710  gev .",
    "we consider this good agreement between the data and pgf calculations due to the correct asymptotic behaviour of the gluon distribution function as @xmath165 , given by @xmath168 dependence .",
    "fig.[psiju3 ] shows this function alone in order to illustrate its threshold dependence .",
    "furthermore , in the two gluon exchange model the pdf enters squared and the near threshold behaviour of the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section is then given by function @xmath169 , which is shown in fig.[psiju1 ]",
    ". however , now the dependence is too steep to reproduce the data near the threshold .",
    "we have analyzed the available data on @xmath0 photoproduction in terms of pomeron exchange , two gluon exchange and photon - gluon fusion models .    allowing the pomeron - quark interaction to be flavour dependent and introducing the soft and hard pomerons it is possible to reproduce almost all available data on @xmath0 photoproduction at @xmath110  gev . at the same time , the model reproduce well the data on @xmath5 meson photoproduction , again taking into account that the interaction of the pomeron with light and charm quarks is very different .",
    "however the pomeron exchange model can not not reproduce the data at @xmath12110  gev and differential spectra at large @xmath2 .",
    "the agreement between the calculations and total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section near threshold should be considered as accidental , because both the slope @xmath47 of the @xmath48 dependence and the forward extrapolated cross section are in strong systematic disagreement with the pomeron exchange model at @xmath12110  gev .",
    "the two gluon exchange pqcd calculations indicate strong sensitivity to the gluon distribution function .",
    "the results obtained with the most modern mrst2001  @xcite and dl  @xcite pdf reproduce the forward @xmath0 photoproduction cross section at @xmath110  gev quite well . the calculations with mrst2001 show correct threshold dependence of the cross section and leave room for a contribution from other mechanisms at low energies .",
    "the two gluon exchange model does not contain any @xmath48 dependence .",
    "its artificial introduction through the isoscalar em proton form factor allows one to reproduce the slope of the @xmath48 dependence at high energies , but fails at @xmath12110  gev .",
    "the calculations with the photon - gluon fusion model again show sensitivity to the gluon distribution function .",
    "the pgf results calculated with mrst2001  @xcite and dl  @xcite pdf are in reasonable agreement with the data on the total @xmath0 photoproduction cross section .",
    "the pgf does not constrain the @xmath48 dependence .    although the pgf calculations with mrst2001 reproduce the threshold behaviour of the total @xmath147 cross section",
    "it does not prove that pqcd is able to describe the reaction at @xmath12110  gev .",
    "it is just an artifact of the correct pdf asymptotic behaviour at @xmath165 , given by @xmath168 dependence .",
    "for instance it is not a case for two gluon exchange model , where the pdf enters as squared and finally the @xmath169 dependence is too steep to reproduce the @xmath0 photoproduction data near the threshold .",
    "we allocate the @xmath0 photoproduction at low energies and large @xmath2 to the mechanism different from pomeron or two gluon exchanges .",
    "the energy dependence of the differential cross section , @xmath46 , indicates that this mechanism does not depend on @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , small slope @xmath47 of the @xmath48 dependence indicates that the exchange does not couple to the isoscalar em proton form factor .",
    "we consider that this might be axial vector trajectory exchange that couples to the axial form factor of the nucleon .",
    "however , a definite conclusion requires more detailed study .",
